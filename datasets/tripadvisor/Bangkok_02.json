The place is well set up and ready for you to get cooking quickly with friendly staff explaining the Thai way. Plus you get to eat it all as you go and leave rather full!"

            "review": "Sign Up for 3 Days!. For any traveler visiting Thailand, a cooking school is a MUST! My fiance and I are vegetarian and discovered May Kaidee's cooking school in Bangkok and Chiang Mai. We both love cooking international cuisine and what better way to bring home Thai culture than with a cooking course. We debated a single day but after seeing the itinerary and menu items we would prepare at May Kaidees, we had to sign up for 3 days. That was the best decision we could have made during our trip!May Kaidee's cooking school teaches local Thai cuisine with an all vegetarian flair. Dishes are prepared with no meat, no fish sauce, and fresh vegetables.Our first day, we were greeted by our wonderful teachers and quickly went upstairs to prepare our first meal. During Day 1, we prepared Tom Yum chili paste, tom yum soup, tom ka soup, Masseman Currey, Pad Thai, spring rolls, and much more. We received small printed cook books with the recipes and had ingredients already prepared and chopped for us to create our meals. In only 4 hours, we created 10 Thai dishes.One word of advise, come prepared to cook and EAT! After preparing each meal, we got to taste and eat our creations which taste exactly like what you would order in a restaurant. The food is very rich since most food is made with coconut milk and sugar so just be aware as you fill your tummy. Food can be taken home for later which is always the best option.At the conclusion of class, we got to engage in some fun Thai dancing and songs related to cooking which made the class fun!Days 2 and 3 were a completely unique experience as we got to influence the menu for each day. My fiance and I wanted to learn how to make Pad See Ew and Thai tea and our teachers graciously modified the schedule to allow us to specifically learn those dishes in addition to a variety of other That curries (red, green), pastes, salads, and noodle dishes. In all, we learned about ~30 dishes during our class. We had more of a 1:1 experience in days 2 and 3 as most students take only the 1 day class which made our experience that much more special and unique. We got the opportunity to really know our teachers, ask any questions about Thai cooking, and spend time decorating our plate and taking pictures. Our Teacher even went into the refrigerator to get garnishes so we could make our plate restaurant quality!Many times during the Day 2 and 3, you can have the option to learn other skills provided by May Kaidee such as raw food and carving but upon request. While we did not take the carving class, we knew the instructor very well and saw the output of the class which was incredible, ornate, pieces of food artwork.In all, I HIGHLY recommend taking the 3 day cooking class at May Kaidees! The instructors are incredible, the food is delicious, and the recipes you learn you will use for a lifetime!"

The dishes are easy to cook and the whole team its really nice and funny. If you would likr to know the basics of thai kitchen like padtai, soup and sticky rice then its this the right course. Only the english from the team was sometimes not easy to understand. Maybe i was also a little bit tired from the night before :). Thats why only 4 points. Enjoy it!"

We received a little cookbook and were given additional instructions as we were cooking. We were encouraged to send any questions when had while we were trying to cook at home (even send pictures of ingredients we weren't sure of!) We were also informed of substitutions that we could make with ingredients that are easy to find in North America, and which recipes could have meat added to them if we desire. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn how to cook thai food!"

He even provided suggestions on how to modify recipes for ingredients you might not find back home! It was basically a 9-course meal and we left full to the brim.

There is tons of cooking schools in Thailand, and to be honest, I booked one last minute and this was about the only one that had spots available, but I am so glad that we chose May Kaidee! It felt very authentic and it was a small group of only 8 people, so we got to know each other quite well and learn more about Thai cooking methods. We each got our own wok and we cooked 8-10 different things. Our instructor was great and told us tons of different ways to modify our food according to our taste. We made papaya salad, pumpkin hummus, tom yam soup, chili paste, pad thai, massaman curry, mango sticky rice and more! The class ended with learning a Thai cooking song and Thai dancing, which started off kind of awkward, but if you just let loose, it's a good time. One warning: Do NOT eat breakfast before you go. We left so incredibly full and even had 2 dishes that we took home."

The teacher had good English and a fun, spirited attitude. We made vegan tom yum sauce and soup, and then vegetarian Pad Thai (skip the eggs for vegan). We learned to make peanut sauce and sticky rice too. Learned how to use some of the basic ingredients such as coconut milk, galangal, kaffir lime, rice noodles and lemon grass. We learned more about cooking wok temperatures for making sauces and dishes. My only wish was to repeat the lesson a few times to make sure I can make these dishes properly at home."

If was one of the best experiences ever! The restaurant is located in a backlane off the famous Khao San Street, and the directions on the cooking school's website are very accurate. We didn't have any trouble locating the place. The website also mentions a detailed agenda for the course and they pretty much follow that to the T. The class size for the afternoon session was just 4 people, which ensured adequate attention from the trainer. My cousin and I, both LOVE Thai food but had never tried cooking the cuisine earlier and found this to be a perfect introduction to Thai cooking. Right from learning about the most basic ingredients (names of which we hadn't even heard of!) to basic building blocks of the main dishes (such as preparing the green chilly sauce for green curry and peanut sauce for Pad Thai) to complete dishes such as the Massaman curry and Tom Yam soup, the course covers it all! They hand out a detailed recipe book to each participant right at the beginning, and one only needs to take incremental notes when required. The only piece of advise I would give is - go with an empty stomach and lots of appetite since you will be having a delicious 6 course meal (all prepared by you!)."

We were looking forward to meeting the warm, funny instructior who teaches you even to sing while cooking. We were the only ones in the pm class conducted by Patty. She was cold from the get go. She short-cut us on the no.of items we cooked. She gave us absolutely no introduction to the ingredients in spite of me reminding her about it more than once. She asked us to cook two dishes as a team and cooked 3 more herself all with a grim face!! She was annoyed that we clicked pics. And finally, she almost chased us out of the place. 2 stars is for the concept itself and nothing more. For this fee, I am sure there are many many others that would have accommodated a party of 7!!

Neither my partner and I are vegetarian however that didn't matter as the dishes were all delicious and can easily be adapted for meat eaters, the massaman was unbelievably good!

There were individual stations for everyone. Once May arrived, we started cooking. She is a bundle of energy and a ton of fun. As opposed to some of the other cooking classes which are actually demonstrations, we made everything. We each had our own ingrediants and cook stations. She helped us to understand the process and let us adjust our own food to our liking. And most importantly, it was easily the best food we had in Bangkok."

Because there were only two of us, we did race ahead with the cooking, so we took a time out in the middle and Wan took us for a bike ride around the neighbourhood which was great fun.I would definitely recommend this experience to anyone regardless of cooking ability"

We had a reasonably priced exquisite vegetarian lunch at May Kaidee's. The ambience itself is like a street shop and the staff appear to be juniors/trainees but the quality of the food is excellent! Don't judge a book by its cover. ;-) Truly mouthwatering scrumptious vegetarian food! If you are a vege lover, you must most definitely visit May Kaidee's. One of the waiters even went the extra mile to get a taxi for us from the main road so great hospitality and great food."

We arrived a bit late as traffic from our hotel was terrible and it took us an hour and 20 minutes to get there. Our taxi driver had to call the restaurant to get more information on where it was located as he did not recognize the address. If you are not staying close to the restaurant and need a taxi to get there I suggest printing out a map of the general area to be able to show the driver. Definitely have the restaurant phone number handy in case it's needed.Although we missed the first recipe due to arriving late, we quickly fell into place and got to work. We made many different dishes. Our teacher was very friendly and helpful. She made sure at the end of each dish that we made to ask if we had any questions before she moved on to the next one. We were given a recipe book with all the recipes in it and we always had time to add notes when we wanted to as we were working.All the food we made was great and she made suggestions on substitutions for ingredients we didn't care for. Overall a great morning and I would definitely recommend it. We ended class by learning a fun song about our yummy food.Just keep in mind if you decide to take the class that the restaurant can be hard to find as it's tucked away in an alley and it may take you a while to get there depending on your hotel location."

As there were only the two of us, we rattled through the lesson at quite a pace, but that suited me well. I found it a really good introduction to a broad range of dishes, and how a few core ingredients can create quite different flavours with just a few tweaks.I was told to come with an appetite, and thinking that meant a big lunch at the end I ate breakfast - big mistake as the format of the class is to cook, eat, cook, eat and I was tucking in Tom Yam by 9.30am. Several things I couldn't manage to get through in the morning were packaged up for me to take away though.The school can be a bit hard to find as it's actually on a little street tucked away behind Tanao road, but if you head behind the Burger King at the end of the Khao San road you should find it."

She is a natural people-person and I heard she is being prompted so she will likely be there for a while. We cooked a ton of food and the recipes (7 or 8) were super easy. You can find most of the ingredients in any grocery store (no matter the country). The class was about $50-60 and I thought it was a good deal. I learned about 7 recipes and got to take home a small little pamphlet with all the recipes. NOTE: You eat a ton in this class so come hungry. My second class was the Wed Tofu Making Class. It was fun (the Thai Cooking class was a little funnier because the instructor was so funny.) May Kaidee teaches the Tofu Making class. She did a good job, too. We only made about 4 dishes because the main focus was making the tofu. Afterwards she surprised us and took us to her other cooking school and let us try on some of the traditional clothes. (I think she did this because she and the other student formed a bond, I'm pretty sure this is not usual.)Con: It was a little hard to find. I stayed in downtown Bangkok so I had to take a 100 boht taxi. I had to ask several taxis because most didn't know where it was even though I had the map MK supplied. I suggest you take a working phone so the taxi driver can call and ask for directions.Bathrooms were ok. Not sure if it is wheelchair accessible. *******Trip Advisor won't let me mark the visit as more than one \"type of visit\", but it is prefect for couples, family with teens, and friends."

Much of the instruction is given in the cooking booklet provided - so, might as well follow from a cookbook! The questions on substitutions weren't well-handled by the instructor (all of us were foreigners, not all ingredients could be easily found outside Thailand). The Thai dancing lesson - is a complete joke and merely an icebreaker to kill a few minutes off the four-hour course. Don't take it seriously."

We have tried a lot of thai food during our holiday and have never imagined that we could also cook these delicious dishes by ourselves.We mad first chili paste and Peanut source. And then we cooked tom yum soup, massaman curry, pumpkin hummus, Papaya salad and pat thai. At last we had mango sticky rice (the best we had in Thailand) as dessert. They were all so easy and delicious. We will try the recipes at home definitely.Tuk speaks very good English and is also very funny. During our cooking course he taught us a song in thai and showed us thai dance. Thanks so much we had really a great day. This was absolutely one the highlights in our trip in Thailand.I wished to go to the market, but they have changed the program in order to have more time in the kitchen. But it was still nice."

I followed the 4 hour Thai cooking course in the morning (9 am-1pm) and it was worth every penny (or the 1500 baht I paid for, easily on the very clear website).The instructor of the day was Tuk, an amazing young guy with a passion for Thai vegetarian food. He explained everything with a smile, in his breathtaking English. Thumbs up for Tuk, he let us prepare around 8 dishes, and gave so much (clear) information about tastes, ingredients, ... We were 10 people in the cooking class that morning and there was a lot of space, and we worked by two, which made it easy to cook and listen en take notes and look for the ingredients at the same time. Would I recommend this cooking class to other vegetarians? Yes. Would I recommend it to non-vegetarians? EVEN MORE. In half a day you learn about some great dishes, and Tuk also makes notes on when and where you will have to add meat/fish in case you'd want that. Win-win for everyone.Thanks Tuk for the amazing cooking class, we'll stay in touch as I will send you some pictures of my Thai prepared dinners at home!"

On the way back to Khao San Road and stumbled on this place and decided to enquire about a cooking course. I booked at 11am for the 2pm 3 hr cooking class. As I recall it cost about 1000 baht. The class consisted of me and two other people. You can't expect to learn to give up your day job and be a full time Thai chef after a 3 hr course, but it was definitely a good introduction. We made a number of dishes and soups so definitely don't eat beforehand. Most of the ingredients are pre-chopped and most of the grunt work has been done beforehand, but to be honest who wants to spend money to chop veggies. Essentially we did all the glamorous stuff like fry stuff in the wok and season and salt to taste. The recipe book we were given was fairly basic and we scribbled some notes in the book during the course. To get the best from the course you really have to ask questions as it's impossible to cover everything in the book. They were extremely knowledgeable and all questions were answered. Afterwards I felt like I could come back to Europe and safely cook a Thai meal for my friends without anyone choking on their noodles. All in all I'd say it was a great experience if you have a few hours to spare in Bangkok. The real value comes from having an interactive experience with an excellent teacher. Go with an open mind, ask lots of questions and enjoy the food and you'll definitely have an unforgettable memory. Unless of course you get Alzheimers later in life, but that is hardly their fault."

An especial when we were staying in a Hotel just 30 m away from May Kaidee on Samsen, how could we miss it ? So, we treated ourselves to a dinner on Songkran day, and truly, it was easily one of the best Thai Veg which we had ever tasted anywhere. The service was friendly and excellent. We also met with a gentleman who appeared to us as one of the partners, and he told us that after Songkran, the Samsen Road restaurant was going to go through a makeover, and there would be more of short eats/quick bites that would be served hitherto. But the other two locations near Khao San would continue to offer the full cuisine. We really enjoyed the cuisine and truly, the prices are reasonable and the portions adequate ( eg 600 Baht for 4 Adults). This place is a must visit to all Veg and Veggie livers."

According to the website, it said that we would start with a trip to the market; however, the actual agenda differed and there were 4 other recipes added instead (we were fine with this, but you might want to confirm before booking if this is important to you). Pran was patient, funny, and knowledgeable...giving us kind words and suggestions when tasting our creations and reminding us of safety (you're in front of a big open flame all morning). Yes, it will be sweaty, busy work--you do just about everything yourself (stirring, cutting vegetables, adding ingredients) except for the dishes (Thanks, Boom!). We left with a recipe book of of the dishes we made, stomachs overly full, and a wish to return for the 5 day cooking school offered (we met two of the students in the restaurant who were taking the 5-day and we were insanely jealous--private instruction, specialized menus, time in the market, and they were very happy). So happy to have Pran as our cooking guide--she is marvelous. PS...While I like spicy food, you are in control of making your dishes as hot or MILD as you want. :)"

The flavours and textures in May's recipes are so amazingly good that the lack of meat isn't an issue.I've learned to make a number of the 'standard' Thai dishes but with May's secret twists. Each dish is a little taste of Heaven. The puddings are superb, especialy the mango with sticky rice and banana fritters.I am currently doing the 3 day course. The first day is shared with one-dayers and is a lot of fun but I feel that the rest is more focused and serious. Both are good of course!"

I'm so glad we did. It was fantastic and a great introduction to thai food. I think we cooked about 10 dishes in total (all vegetarian) and they were all delicious. My wife is vegetarian and I'm not, but the lack of meat didn't bother me one bit. Our teacher took the time to let me know when and how I can add meat to the dishes when I cook them at home. We had a very small class of 6 and it was really fun. By the time we finished the class at 1pm we had eaten so much fantastically tasty food I was full up for the whole day. Even if you don't fancy taking the class, I'd recommend eating at this restaurant as all their food is marvelous."

The day started out with a fun song that you sing throughout the day. I could see how that could be annoying to some people, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. Once the cooking begins,it is so much fun! Others have complained that you are \"just throwing things into a pan,\" but we were okay with this. It allowed us to make a lot of dishes in a short amount of time, and I don't really need instructions how to cut up carrots and onions anyway. Being vegetarion, it was a bit difficult to find food in the city and be certain that it did not contain fish sauce, so we stuffed ourselves! We are very excited to try out the recipes at home. If you are vegetarian and love Thai food, this class is a must!"

I love that you get the option of going to the market in the morning to buy the vegetables and rice papers (even if it is only a man with one wagon of vegetables is it cool and you get to see the woman making the rice papers!) The food was sooo flavourful and I did not even notice that it was all vegetarian. Take the morning class if it will fit in your timeframe. We were sooo full after making and eating all of the dishes but the dancing at the end of the class is a good way to end the morning full of food! She was really great at explaining everything that was going on and we even went over our time but she was in no rush to kick us out. Her cook book is worth buying and I have made the recipes since getting home and they bring me right back to BKK!

I signed up for a morning class; there were just three of us, and we cooked about 10 items that included spice pastes, in about 2 hours, with time in between to sit and sample everything we cooked. We had plenty of time left after cooking and eating. Wan is a good, patient, teacher. If you are an expert cook, the lessons might be a bit underwhelming, but the food is still great! Eat a very light breakfast waaaay before class begins as you end up sampling food throughout the class. We weren't taken to any markets for shopping, and while there was some singing, there was no dancing or trying on dance costume accessories in our class. No big deal for me, but if you care to do all that, it may or may not happen, be prepared. Tamarind was never used in any of the ten dishes, lime juice was always substituted even when Tamarind would have been a good choice. If you are a serious cook or a chef or a knowledge-hungry foodie, you will not get answers to serious questions about technique or origins or ingredients or the rationale for substitutions or regional differences for the cooking class menu items. You get a fair basic education about vegetarianizing the basic Thai staples you tend to find in Thai restaurants outside Thailand. However, great bang for buck. The class I took was in Tanau Road."

Our class ended up taking about 2 hours since we didn't have the delays of waiting for others. The cooking space is very modern and well laid out, which was a surprise as the Khao San Road area generally feels very commercial and old. We've eaten at both this location and the Samsen Road location and the food is excellent, but now we have the skills to make all of our favorites at home and it was the best yet. I am amazed at how quick and easy Thai food is to prepare so I hope to use my wok a lot more often now. They give you a recipe book, but I think they skip certain dishes, as we didn't make the pumpkin curry or Issan vegetables. I already had way too much food, so that's probably a good thing. I'm a vegan, but she taught us how to make each dish the traditional way if you want to add meat. I think this class is great for anyone who is not a gourmet cook, vegetarian or not."

Very professionally run, in an air conditioned, spanking clean room set up with cooking stations, above the restaurant. (Just a few doors along from Ethos, another gem I found on tripadvisor). Use the map and directions on the website not tripadvisor as its not quite accurate. I'd suggest you pop in beforehand, make your booking, explore the amazing vegetarian area it's in, and then you will know how to get there in the for your class.

My boyfriend and I were looking for a different/more advanced class since I had already taken a cooking course in Bangkok at a different school and he's already a great cook. The tofu course looked like the perfect thing for us and started off very promising with free appetizers and we found out we would be taught by May Kaidee herself! After a late start, we were left picking the shells of beans for about 20 minutes while May and her sister ran around and seemed pretty disorganized. After, May went about making the tofu with pretty much no explanation and my prying questions had to pull the answers out of her. Then, after limited involvement the first go around, we were left completely to ourselves to make tofu #2 while May and her sister chatted and proceeded to eat about half of our tofu treats. We were expecting a mini cooking class after making tofu including tofu based recipes but nothing of the sort was offered. We were given cold soup as an afterthought and some leftover brown rice with peanut sauce lying around. We did get to make peanut sauce after my boyfriend asked to do something else. And by \"make\" I mean I read the ingredient list out of the cookbook and May threw the prepared ingredients into the bowl.It was a huge disappointment and completely not worth the 1500 Baht each we both paid. It sounds like the \"normal\" cooking classes are better and if we hadn't felt so ripped off, maybe we would have tried one of those."

It was a pity because I was looking forward to a great Thai vegetarian class. First of all the market tour was a greater disappointment. I attended Cooking with Poo last year and we had a truly extensive market tour in Khlong Toey market and that was a feast for the eyes. In May Kaidee's class, we actually shopped from 1-2 sidewalk vendors near by. Her menu does not change at all so it is no wonder that 2-3 people attend the class at 1 time. It is a pity because her set up is pretty comfortable in a clean air-conditioned place. May Kaidee does not teach the classes herself anymore. She just made an appearance and demonstrated one curry paste and did the Thai dance at the end. I think she should totally stop forcing students to learn her Thai cooking song praising her but instead teach other recipes which were promised in her website."

To start with we arrived at the location we believed it to be at (Samsen Rd) for the 1pm afternoon class as per the booking we made via the website. I had sent an email after making the booking asking for confirmation as we had paid a deposit online however never received anything back confirming our booking. I did not have a response to my follow up email. (I had also previously paid 99baht online to receive their pumpkin humus recipe and never received it even though my payment went through. I had tried to follow this up via email earlier as well and was told they would send a link, which never happened. All follow up emails I made I had no response from - in the end I gave up as it was only 99baht).Anyway, after arriving at 12.50pm we were asked whether we had made a booking to which I said yes online. I was asked whether I had received a confirmation email (no). I explained that I had tried to follow up in regards to that via email and had had no response. I was then told that the course had moved locations and time and that it now started at 2pm. The man did say he would take us to the new location.Now re the actual course. It was only the two of us for the first 15mins (May started at 1.45 with us which was nice since we had been expecting to start at 1pm and they werent expecting anyone else at this point. Lucky for us another girl turned up at 2pm - which was great because I think without her company we would have walked out of the course half way through. As per other reviews, everything is cut up for you, nearly the same ingredients for every dish. This I already knew from reviews but I didn't realise that we would be literally given the basic cookbook and told 'one read instructions, one follow.'. They may as well just post you out the booklet and say 'here, cook'. The dishes were all way to sweet to the point where they curries were inedible to me. The main reason I took this course despite the negatives that I read in the reviews was to mAke the issan vegetables and pumpkin humus as these were not offered in other cooking schools and I was looking for something different. Well, we were told that 'today we skip issan' and told to move on to next recipe. I questioned this (as it states both on the website and brochure that it is included) and was told 'we skip'. After we were shown how to make fresh spring rolls and I could see that they had brought up a tiny bowl each of sticky rice and mango (no, we did not get to make, only told how to cook sticky rice) I asked about the pumpkin humus. Was told 'today, we skip'. It was then that I spoke up and said that the reason I took this class was to make the issan vegetables and pumpkin humus and they were skipping both. She then said grumpily, 'ok, I show you', went downstairs to get some ingredients then came back up and went over to a wok on the other side of the room and started cooking something while the three of us were leftat a table in the corner. I asked if we could come over and watch what she was doing and she said 'no, I'm just cooking some pumpkin'!! She then came over and showed us what to do making a very small batch of the humus. She did let us actually make it which was nice. She served us each a tsp worth on a piece of cucumber then took the rest away! At the beginning of the course we were shown how to make the essential chilli paste they use for a lot of recipes. It was very quick and didn't look like the end result they had in the bowl already. It was funny as when I got back to my room, I noticed when reading my recipe booklet that it was someone else's from a previous class as they had written in the chilli paste recipe and it was totally different from what we were shown! (theirs had soy sauce, sugar and sweet and sour sauce which we were not shown, which probably explains why it looked different!Overall there was no love or care to the course. We were ripped off as to what we didn't get to cook, what we did was not that nice at all. Same vegies all prepared and didn't even look fresh with some of them (lemongrass etc looked dried up and precut hours ago). Big shame.We are here in Bangkok a week to do a few cooking schools. This was our second. We did Chef Leez two days ago and it was fabulous. Originally I had doubts about chef Leez due to the basic menu but she just made the class and showed us special tricks and techniques and talked to us an discussed what we were doing etc. there was none of this at Mays. It is a production line of dothis, do that.Other than Chef Leez which was great, I have no doubt there would be many other better options in Bangkok. Maybe because it is so Close to Khao San rd they know they can just utilize the backpackers as a way of making quick money?By the way, may only took us at the beginning then left us in the hands of Wun."

We visited the cooking school recently, finding the place was a long and troublesom.The class itself was lots of fun, food was good and the joy was in the air, we had a great time and learned some nice thai recipts.What we felt was missing was some background - how to approach the special thai herbs and spices, and some explanations on each dish before the actual cooking. We did get some while we worked, but between reading instructions from the book and cooking for the first time, it wasn't easy to understand what May was saying over the noise.All together we had fun, though, and we do recommend this attraction if you like cooking."

I am currently back in Bangkok, and the restaurant was the first place I went. So glad to see that not only is she still there, but also has a proper air conditioned multi station cooking school and new cook book. I took the making tofu class, which was great. May is a fabulous person to spend the day with, and her classes are fun but packed with information. Highly recommend."

We learnt over 10 recipes, they were so tasty but simple enough to know that I could easily recreate them back in the UK. No complicated ingredients, and May and her lovely assistant gave us lots of tips for substitutions we could make if certain herbs/vegetables were not available.I came to the cooking school on my own and joined a small group for the afternoon session (5 of us altogether). It was a fun and friendly afternoon. We had an interesting discussion with May at the end of the class, about food choices, vegetarianism, and health. As a vegetarian it was great to find a cooking school that was consistent with my way of eating, but I would also recommend it to meat-eaters because as we cooked each dish we were told when we would add meat if we were using it.Highly recommended and really good value! I can't wait to get home and cook these recipes for my friends and family!"

May Kaidee's Cooking School was a fun way to spend a morning!My girlfriend wanted us to take a course while in Bangkok so we decided on May Kaidee's place.You'll find the restaurant portion at ground level and the school is on the second floor above however,It can be hard to find so check the address on your map or call ahead for directions in Thai for your cab driver.The course my girlfriend took was basic Thai cooking and preparation of staple spices. It was a bit junior for her as she already is a great cook and the \"sing along portion\" of grinding spices she found a bit juvenile.I chose a culinary carving lesson rather than the cooking as I don't share the kitchen at home but I can also cook.I have experience in carving and found the lesson challenging but rewarding! We were all treated to an impromptu Thai dance at the end of the class by May and her assistant which I thought was very entertaining but again my girlfriend did not.The course was not cheep but was a really nice way to spend a morning! It's also close by Kho San road and other attractions in Bangkok. I think it was fun if not as informative as the knowledgeable may want! (check location before you go)"

We were met by the lovely instructor around 9am at the secondary May Kaidee restaurant, on Sam Sen Road. She took us on a short walk to the main restaurant where the cooking class is conducted. We stopped off to see a lady making the super fine dough for spring rolls where we also sampled a delicious treat of this dough filled with sugar cane (YUMMY!). In the main class we were presented with a booklet full of the recipes we would be making, ten dishes in all! (At this point we realised we should NOT have had any breakfast!) The lovely instructor taught us initially how to make delicious fresh chilli paste, a base for several of the dishes that we would go to cook. We then took it in turns with our cooking partner (take a hubby if possible ;) ) to read the ingredients out whilst the other partner was on the wok side of the action, cooking it all up! Amongst other dishes, we cooked delicious Thai green curry (a standard when in Thailand surely?!), Massaman curry (this was gorgeous), Pad Thai, stir fried vegetables with ginger and cashew nuts, Green papaya salad, Issan, fresh spring rolls (non-deep fried and extremely lovely!) and mango sticky rice. Wow wow wow! A real culinary experience!The food was fab, the tuition light-hearted but very informative and professional, we sang the famous 'Sap, sap sap sap sap' song, and even did some Thai dancing at the end of the class, and took some photos with everyone. It really was one of the best experiences myself and husband had in Thailand. A MUST DO for any visitor to this fabulous city!! :-D"

I can confirm that you do get to cook them all - it's not rushed at all, the recipe book you are given at the end is helpful and I picked up a lot of tricks along the way. We were advised that the afternoon class is usually more relaxed so we opted for that. We had difficulty finding the restaurant/school but a couple of phone calls and May met us nearby and a quick tour of backstreets and we were there. We were the only two in the class - May seemed to assess our level of interest and skill and adapted the class accordingly. She left us alone to try things and would magically appear at the critical moment - point out what we could do better and why and then prove that she knows exactly what she's doing by showing us. We tried all the dishes we cooked - all excellent and easy to make at home. Good value - easy to understand - simple recipes - worth doing."

This would be a good course for beginner cooks as much of the work (peeling, grating, chopping, sometimes even measuring) is already done for you. You will make many different kinds of dishes which makes it a fun way to try different Thai foods. The trip to the \"market\" was a bit of a letdown. We went to a vegetable stand, a spring roll maker, and a convenience store. The spring roll maker was quite interesting and I enjoyed watching her much practiced movements. However, I could have happily done without the other two stops.I also took her vegetable and fruit carving class afterward. Great fun! I learned to make all sorts of flowers, leaves, etc using cucumber, carrot, tomato, pumpkin, and watermelon. May was very patient and encouraging whenever my knife would slip or I made a mistake."

As others have commented it isnt without room for improvement, you make about 8 dishes which are loosely based on the same core ingredients. The hard work has been done for you, as all the amounts have been pre chopped and measured, so you cant really go too far wrong.May is a lovely character and she has a wonderful energy which makes the class great fun, but she does play up to her growing celebrity.The 'market' is a sham; I have been to asian markets and most tourists would not want to eat food if they saw it sold there first. The market you get to visit is a barrow set out with some produce in a car park. This was my biggest dissappointment and I think they should remove the market trip as it was unneccesarry.The teaching was clear and the food tasted good, it's at a basic level, you need no cooking ability to do it, and there are plenty of staff around to keep you doing it right!As others have noted, you share a cooking station with another, for me this was okay, as I was travelling with my partner... But it felt a bit cheeky, as we had both paid for a course, the price wasn't per pair.On the whole I really enjoyed the class and the negatives are listed in the hope the school can improve and future customers have a realistic expectation."

We took the morning class, which included preparation of 12 vegan dishes. May Kaidee has a larger-than-life personality and this guides the entire experience. She met us at the door when we arrived and served us some fresh fruit and bottle water. When the entire class had arrived, she demonstrated a few preparation techniques and described some of the basic ingredients we would use. As newcomers to Thai cooking (though we've eaten it for years), we learned a lot about unfamiliar ingredients. We also learned a cooking song that she probably wrote.After a short trip to a nearby fruit stand and spring-roll wrapper artisan shop, we went into the kitchen. My wife and I each teamed up with one of our daughters at separate woks and stations. May Kaidee and her staff prepare all of the ingredients, and do all of the dishes, so the course moves along at a rapid pace. May continually circulates through the kitchen and helps when necessary, without taking away your control. After cooking each meal, we sat at the table and ate it. After 4/12 courses, we were totally stuffed! Pace yourself and bring some of it home.After the kitchen, we returned to the restaurant dining room for spring roll and dessert preparation. Then May donned some traditional Thai garb and put on a dance show. Everyone was encouraged to dance, and most folks (even other restaurant patrons) joined in.After it's all over, time to pay. This is when you need a printout of the website where you booked. Website says 1200baht/adult, half price children. Total price for our family should be 3600 baht. However, at checkout, May told us the price would be 4,000 baht for our family. No big deal, still well worth the experience, so I paid it without making a stink. I did feel like a little bait-and-switch was going on, however. On the other hand, this was common practice throughout Thailand, where the well-dressed foreigner (esp. American) is expected to pay a higher price."

The prep work (such as veg cutting etc) is done for you and all you need to worry about is cooking the food from instructions. It's really effective and interesting to see how Thai food cooking works in practice - in just under 4 hours (including an hour at the markets and discussing herbs, and 30 mins eating sweets and watching Thai dancing) and working in pairs we made 10 dishes, including green curry from paste, peanut satay sauce, and a really excellent Pad Thai I was very happy with.This course is veggie, and can be adapted for vegans. (I am neither, but figured a little more veggie food in my diet can't hurt and it's not like I don't know how to cook meat already.) There is a bathroom on-site. The kitchen is not air-conditioned and it does get hot while cooking, so dress light.If you are already very familiar with Thai cooking or a particularly accomplished cook, you may find this course a bit basic for your needs, but if you are interested in cooking Thai this is a great way to see how fast it can come together, really boosted my confidence and I can't wait to try it out when I get home."

We were 9 participants that day, so almost everyone was paired off - they had me make dishes on my own because I mentioned my soy sensitivity and they showed me the modifications to avoid soy sauce. (As a side note to anyone else avoiding soy, mushroom sauce does still have 20% soy sauce, but some are able to tolerate that).Tips:-Skip breakfast before going - even doing so, I was too full to eat dessert!-I purchased the package of sauces and the vegetable grater at the end of the class.

            "review": "Fantastic Cooking School in Bangkok!. A fantastic Cookery School in Bangkok - 100% Vegetarian! Really well organised experience with May Kaidee which was fun, informative and a great way to learn how to make authentic thai food. The day starts with an explanation and demonstration of chilli paste - including all the raw ingredients. We then went to a local place where a lady was making Spring Roll Wrappers, followed by a small market stall where we got to talk about all the different types of vegetables. We then went back to the restaurant and in the back kitchen we each had a work station with wok and all prepared ingredients. We then worked through the May Kaidee Recipe book - making Green Curry, Pad Thai, Massaman Curry and more! So much food - and after making each dish you then get to eat it! All through the cooking there is laughter and the May Kaidee 'Sap Sap' song - really thai experience! I love Thai Food - but I usually have to be careful of the animal ingredients that are used i.e. Fish Sauce/Shrimp etc. but this was great as I could eat ALL of it and enjoy Thai Food which I can now make at home in the UK! Sap Sap Sap Sap Saaaaap! I found this Cookery School before our first visit to Thailand - I booked it online and paid a deposit - we then paid the remainder when we left. Would also recommend the May Kaidee restaurants - they are sublime!"

May's class is vegan, but of course at home you can add and change as you like. The class covered everything from the trip to the market, the cooking of the rice paper, and all the identification of the new Thai specific ingredients through the most challenging steps and wok cooking. We ate until we nearly popped. May and Jo were SO KIND! I took a second, afternoon, class later during my visit. This course allowed me to choose any of the menu items from the adjoining eatery's fare. Foe the second class May was my private teacher. I was even allowed to invite my hungry husband at the end of the course to help eat all of our \"lessons\". I still rave about May's class. AMAZING!"

None of my friends fancied it so I went by myself. When I turned up I was the only person booked in so it was just me and May Kaidee together. She taught me to cook over 20 dishes to my taste and provided all the ingredients and I was then able to take them all home and had them for dinner and the lunch the next day! MAy Kaidee was lovely and welcoming. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and would absolutely recommend this to everyone who has the chance. Get along to May Kaidees!!!"

Ohn, was a wonderful instructor. She communicated clearly, was very entertaining and gave us lots of helpful hints for when cooking in Thai style. We made tons of dishes, went to a little market to explore and even had time to get special goodies like coconut water and see the owner dance a fun traditional Thai dance! Highly recommend!"

            "review": "Too rushed, but good enough food. When I took this class there was only one other student, which gave me hope that we would both get a lot of attention, and have an intimate experience. To an extent this was true, but I didn't get Mai Kaidee's undivided attention like I did with the cooking class I took in Vietnam (there was also two of us in that case).The visit to the \"market\" was disappointing. We went to the storefront where the rolls for spring rolls are made (which was cool), and then we walked over to a man with a food cart containing a dozen or so different fruits and vegetables. I would hardly call that a market. Again, in Vietnam we went to a proper market with hundreds of stalls where we were the only caucasian people there. It was very authentic.We went back to the school and again I was a little dissapointed when compared to Vietnam. There was only one cooking station for the two of us. Since we made a lot of dishes, there was more food then we could eat, but it would have been nice to have cooked each dish myself. If you count cooking a sauce from scratch as it's own thing, we made something like 12 or 13 recipes. We were in too much of a rush to make all the dishes.Expanding on my last point, I preferred the Vietnamese cooking class where my friend and I had our own cutting boards and we cut all our own vegetables. In this class everything was pre-cut for us. If you want some of the work to be done for you, then you will enjoy this class more than I did.The food was good, but too many of the recipes included coconut milk. I'm not the biggest fan of coconut. So, if you like coconut you'll like the recipes. It's just possible that I like Vietnamese food more than Thai.On the plus side the recipes are all vegetarian, and they can make them vegan for you quite easily. At most other cooking schools you must adapt the recipes for them to become vegetarian. You can take a better (and cheaper) cooking class in Chiang Mai. My friends that took classes there really enjoyed them.Lastly, there was a cultural element - I don't care for singing and dancing so doing that at the end of the class didn't add any value for me. I imagine it would be a big plus for others."

My partner had some experience with Thai cooking and took a course back in Australia, but May's cooking was very different. It was impressive how quick her recipes were to prepare and how easily flavours could be adjusted. Everything was really yummy too! Neither of us are vegetarian, and only realized that the course was that when we arrived that morning, but May was helpful in telling us how you could incorporate meat or chicken into the dishes, or use different sauces. May was a delightful teacher to have, and an impressive business woman. It's hard not to like her! We were expecting to walk away absolutely stuffed, but you only nibble on the food after each dish, so only get to try a bit of everything. It was a meal overall though."

May is a delightful host; really fun personality and lots of energy. I'd highly recommend her. We also found it easy to book with her vs. Silom or Blue Elephant. I would probably rate my fiancee and I as slightly advanced amateurs. This seemed to be true of the other students as well. The cooking was not too difficult, but very enjoyable and all in all a great intro into Thai cuisine. I don't think its realistic to expect more in a 3 hour session anyway.The group is split into pairs and each pair has a set of ingredients and a burner. The chopping and menial tasks are done for you and May watches your moves to keep you from screwing up :). You eat along the way, which is great, so you get real-time feedback on your work.The morning session also includes a walk through a local market to get ingredients which was a lot of fun. Also, we are not vegetarians (quite the opposite really), and still had a blast.The kitchen area is comfortable and very functional; not as polished some high end places, but that's not what we were looking for."

We were 8 people in May's restaurant and she started by showing and naming the ingredients we would use, after which we left to shop for the ingredients. The first place was about a 5 minute walk away where we saw how the crepe/tortilla-like sheets that would be used to make spring rolls are made. We then stopped at a cart were May bought the rest of the ingredients and gave us a brief explanation as to what they are. It is not a market, so don't expect to go with your basket ready to shop with the locals. Back in the restaurant, each pair are assigned a table with all of the ingredients to be used in the cooking (already washed an cut/prepped), a wok and an apron in an open-air kitchen.The cooking experience was fun and entertaining as you get to mix the ingredients in the wok by following the order in the recipe booklet. Almost all the dishes tasted fantastic! Of the 14 recipes in the booklet, we prepared about 10. Throughout the session, May ducked in and out, leaving us with her assistants. At the end of the class, she played some of her music (she has a band apparently) and showed us some traditional Thai dancing; the rest of the group then joined in (with \"encouragement\").Overall, the experience was pleasant, memorable, and well worth the money. Recommended for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. Definitely go hungry as you will get to not only cook but also eat lots of delicious food!"

May Kaidee was not my first cooking class in Bangkok and I didn't think it was a particularly good one. Instead of the promised market we only visited a lady which had some veggies and herbs for sale on her cart (no other vendors there). In the kitchen we had to share the cooking spots as there was only one wok per two persons. In other cooking classes you go to a real market and everybody has a wok to cook alone. As well, we used exactly the same vegetables for every dish, which was a bit boring. Even though I had a nice morning I wouldn't recommend this class for a first-timer."

You each get a small recipe book with the 10 recipes you will be cooking, and after you finish each one, you eat it... so remember to save room for the dishes at the end! We had fun cooking, and towards the end when we were getting tired, May had us singing and dancing!I love the recipes because they are extremely simple, and feature easy-to find ingredients (easily found at Asian markets in the US). Also the recipes are for single servings, which is great for people living alone or just cooking for 1 or 2 people. Plus they are all vegetarian, but still taste just as good (or better) than their meaty counterparts. I ended up buying her cookbook because the recipes were so easy and tasty."

I for one cannot cook but she helped us make our food absolutely delicious!She starts off by taking us to the market and shows us the various vegetables and spices we would be using during the class to make our dishes. It was pretty cool to see what the core of Thai food is made up of because normally you just see vegetables on the side of the road and never really know what they're for. She explains pretty much every spice that we used during the class which was really helpful! There are so many dishes she teaches us and each one is as good as the next one even though they are all vegetarian dishes. My favorite was the peanut sauce and spring rolls. Oh and I can't forget the song and dance portion of the class! This was my favorite part because we got to sing a cute Thai song and dance to Thai music. She also has her May Kaidee products such as chili paste and vegetarian cook book which make great gifts. It wasn't as if she was TRYING to sell these, we actually wanted to buy all of this stuff! At the end she had us sign her guest book and give us our e-mail addresses and where we're from. She plans on having a big get together sometime in the future which would be just amazing.

The class begins with a trip to the local market where we learn about the look, texture, taste and smell of the primary Thai vegetables and pick the vegetables and fruits for our class. We then prepare the fruits and vegetables and cook 10 delicious foods. All along the way, we taste the dishes so by the end were quite full. For those who do not fill up before the class ends, you can feast on all the prepared dishes. Another bonus is that the class is quite small - only 4 of us, so we each received personal attention.

Pleased to say it was just as good this time as before but the facilities were better still. Both my daughters wanted to be vegetarian this week and this was no problem for them as they arranged suitable substitutes. Not really a hassle but just be prepared for quite a long taxi ride as the location a a bit outside central Bangkok. "

            "review": "A Kind and Compassionate Teacher. Chef LeeZ (Ajaan Lee) is a kind and caring teacher. Her focus is on making traditional Thai foods from homemade ingredients. As she explains affectionately, this is the way that \"grandma\" made things, before Thai society began to consume more processed, fast-foods. So, in a sense, the course is just as much about respecting Thai heritage as it is about enjoying good Thai food. You'll learn to make several popular Thai dishes in this course, including Pad Thai, Tom Yum Soup, and Mango with Sticky Rice. All the dishes are enjoyable. That said, the amount of work and time that goes into making these dishes can be somewhat time consuming and intimidating. I'm not sure how sustainable it is to eave the course and be able to make all of these dishes back home and achieve the same results. However, Chef LeeZ is inspiring. One thing I really admire about her, besides her great culinary skills, it that she spends time teaching cooking skills to orphans in the community. This is great. Overall, if you have an afternoon to spare and want to learn more about traditional Thai cooking, this could be a fun experience for you. It offers a deeper glimpse into the heart of Thailand."

I just came back from my cooking lessons with Chef Leez and I feel that I am able to right away cook at home the dishes taught in today's class. I signed up for a group class but I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I had a solo class instead (Yay! More talk time with the teacher Chef). Yes you will learn to cook so many dishes as advertised in their website (and we did it in a matter of 2 hours!). I was accorded an instant tour in their garden to familiarize myself with the fresh ingredients used in the recipe. Yes - everything was made from scratch and I learned some tips and tricks in e kitchen. Truly the teacher loves to cook and teach what she knows, imparting all the practical lessons that either an occasional or an avid cook would appreciate. The assistants in the kitchen made the cooking much more enjoyable (no washing up!) and Chef has her own system in teaching how dishes are cooked which made them so easy to duplicate at home. I highly recommend Chef Leez to anyone who would like to learn Thai cooking. No MSG, no oyster sauce, no food coloring. Just honest to goodness fresh and natural ingredients. I hope Chef Leez has another cooking module to offer because I definitely will come back for more lessons."

However, if you are a budget concious traveller looking for a quick introduction to various Thai dishes then this is the course for you. First the class is big; about 20 ppl squeezed into a small room with tiny prep counters. When we fried the hot chilies, the entire room was full with pungent smoke and aroma. Second, in order to expedite things much faster much of the prep is already done by the sous chefs ahead of time and during the class; that said so you are not getting the full culinary experience. Third, portions are tiny! You will need a meal afterwards so plan ahead. Finally it's really rushed; I truly can't recreate any of the dishes at home as it went so fast."

Recipe print outs are great but instructions are basic, make sure to make notes if your enjoy cooking yourself."

Chef Leez is truly passionate about her craft and spares no effort in ensuring she explains the how and why of every step along the way. The food we prepared was better than any Thai food I have ever tasted and I was so surprised at how easy each dish is to prepare. Our class ran 30 minutes over schedule but she was patient to ensure we had a full experience.

I scheduled to take the cooking class from 10am to 2pm for my mom and I and we were currently staying at a hotel in Bangkok. With traffic included, the ride via car took about 45-55 minutes. Upon arrival, we approached such a clean and welcoming alley where Chef Leez's school is located. She welcomed us with such a sincere smile, she even allowed for our driver to stay as we take the class. Some construction was going on towards the side of the building, it looked like people were working on the cement and garden but it did not affect our class whatsoever. Our class included 4 others which was a total of 6 in the class which I thought was perfect and very intimate. Chef Leez also has very great helpers who assist her with the ingredient preparations, cleaning, and setting up that my mom and I couldn't help but tip them at the end of the experience. Everyone is very kind and helpful that they were also willing to take photos while we were cooking.Chef Leez's approach to teach her authentic Thai recipes passed on from her grandma is very simple to understand. Thai cuisine is easier to create than what you would think, it's all about using the correct ingredients and adapting to the style of Thai cooking which consists of salty, sweet and sour. Chef Leez even goes over how to grocery shop for the proper produce, providing the class with tips and tricks to help you to understand it a bit better. Copies of the recipes are also provided to take home and after each demonstration, Chef Leez has you demonstrate back to her the dish and you get to eat it after each demonstration. So yes, you will get full by the end of class! Overall, I would highly recommend taking her class as she is full of life, very funny, experienced, and is the definition of authentic. Thank you Chef Leez for having my mom and I, you were great and would like to wish you prosperity on your great work!"

We learned how to use the freshest ingredients, making each recipe like her 'grandmother' would make it - choosing fresh coconuts and removing the meat from these, then from these making coconut cream and coconut milk (and comparing these to the taste of tinned coconut milk - what a difference), making authentic chili pastes, and learning the difference between the slice mixes that make up masaman, green and red curry, Indian curry, and panang. We each cooked our own recipes, and we were worried that our 14 year old son would lose interest, but she kept him busy! She even had him dry roast whole spices for the class to watch at one point. This class was a great respite from visiting temples, which we had done the day before, and we highly recommend it! Our best experience in Thailand so far!"

The class seemed pretty full, but there was plenty of room, equipment, materials, and ingredients for everyone. While Chef Lee explained things and entertained us, her staff worked tirelessly to prepare ingredients and pass out materials to each member. I loved having the printed out recipes to be able to read while I was there and to take home with me to show friends and family what we cooked. The class was a great balance of information about Thai food and Thai cooking and demonstration by the chef, combined with the hands-on cooking, never mind getting the chance to eat everything we made!! Chef Lee kept us laughing the whole time and it was great to be able to take pictures while we worked. Taking home a wonderful memory and a full belly from this experience!"

Chef LeeZ is a positively energetic person with a radiant smile and great sense of humor with a gift for teaching people how to cook Thai food with all natural ingredients and an old school method taught by her grandmother. While Chef LeeZ was teaching, her staff was busy preparing the trays of ingredients for each student making the transition from observing to hands-on quick and flawless. We ate many delicious dishes which we had prepared in a short period of time. Chef LeeZ teaches her class in a lovely modern home in a secure residential community on the outskirts of Bangkok. When the class was finished, Chef LeeZ escorted all of us to the boat taxi dock not far from her house via a small public transport bus which we were able to catch at the end of her street. I cannot say enough good things about this class, and I would recommend this class to anyone wanting to learn how to cook authentic Thai dishes from a wonderful person."

She thoughtfully includes information on variations, for example how to take green curry and with a few substitutions have masa man curry.

The classes are small enough to feel like you are being given time, but big enough so that you don't feel all the focus is on you. The little trip to the local market to purchase the ingredients for the recipes was really cool and probably one of my favourite parts of the afternoon! In the class we made mango sticky rice, some curries and a Papaya salad. All delicious!!! By the end of the class I was so so full!!! We got along really well with the others in the class which were a mix of solo travellers, friends and couples. I highly recommend this cooking class!!! Thank you Chef Leez!!"

I had been in Bangkok for 10 days already and was starting to feel a little worn thin by the heat, humidity, and massive amounts of tourists. I needed a break and this is what was prescribed. My first thought was about the distance to the school. There are several schools within walking distance of my area in Silom district, so this seemed a bit of a stretch. However, thanks to Uber this was easier than ever. The Chef's sense of humor was a boon to the course. She made it easy to follow and digest the tons of information, history, and reviews of what to look for in other thai restaurants. As an educator, I know what to look for in how curriculum is structured. She had clearly put her time into planning and implementation, but for us it was easy breezy. Almost like watching a ballet. You know it's hard work, but she made it look so effortless. PS. I arrived an hour early to beat the traffic and was able to walk down the street 10 minutes to the local market. Not the same as the markets inside the city. More casual atmosphere and much cheaper prices. I walked down and got a motorcycle ride back for 10 baht."

We decided to take a piece of this beautiful culture with us and what could be better to learn how to cook some of their most delicious dishes!I put together a group of 12 friends to enjoy one Saturday class. One couple couldn't make it and I thought I will loss their tuition cost since you have to pay in advance but no, Cheff LeeZ said\" No problem\" and reverse that money to me. That is something difficult to see in Asia, once you paid, most of the time the money is gone...you can change the product but money back is a difficult one. That also talk about the honesty you will find in this class.Every thing was set and prepared when we arrived, the guide with recipes, our prone, etc.Training started and after a short introduction, we walked to a nearby local Thai market where she teached you how to select good and safe products, this part was really nice! We saw many Beautiful things!Then we come back to our classroom to start preparing some ingredient. She also show the difference between \"do it yourselves Vs. buying the marked ready to use\" products.We cooked like 7 different dishes and eat all that...my group did an extra mile by buying local cold beer to pair with our just cooked delicious Thai food! EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE If you are in Bangkok and want to do something funny and enjoyable beyond the intense night life, go to Cheef LeeZ Cooking Class. She is a very nice, fun and a good Chef.Thanks Chef Less!This review was for her old location, Chef LeeZ mentioned that we were the last group in that place. looks like the new school have much better facilities but the old school was really a fit for purpose site."

Chef Lee made me feel so welcome and had no problem at all making the menu vegan. This is the only class I found in Bangkok that would allow me to attend without paying a ridiculous amount or make me attend a private class. You can be vegan or vegetarian and cook with other students who use meat, you all will have your own pans and stations so it doesn't get mixed. She just makes it very easy and comfortable for everyone. The class is so organized and really allows you to learn skills that you can take home. I was surprised to find out how healthy she cooks too. She gives you so many options and alternative products to use at home to substitute for things that might be hard to find in your home town or just ways to make the meal healthier and more flavorful.Chef Lee is a very intelligent and kind person, in addition to being a fantastic chef! I wouldn't recommend going anywhere else."

It was a fun class bc Chef Leez has a great sense of humor and keeps everyone involved.

Otherwise, you will pay 400 bht or more. Highly recommend and I would attend again."

She did a great job explaining all of the ingredients, and it was really fun doing the cooking at our individual stations. Our class size was pretty small, which meant a lot of one on one attention.

At the end of class, we received a printout with recipes for everything we made, and we can\u2019t wait to try everything out at home. The market trip was also eye opening and informative. My only complaint is that it is quite a trek to get to the cooking school. We were staying near the Grand Palace, and it was an hour drive (in light traffic). The other thing is that it took 2 taxis before we found one willing to turn on the meter rather than trying to extort us because of the distance. Make sure you print out the instructions before you go, as you will need them to find the school (which is located in a residential neighborhood inside Chef Leez\u2019s house).

Chef LeeZ threw open her doors 30 minutes early when she saw our group hover around the entrance, thrilled to have made it so early through the notorious Bangkok traffic. I expected to dilly-dally on the streets until 10:00, but she welcomed us inside away from the heat, and immediately conversed with us like old friends. The class structure itself was very efficient, even with just one other helper. Together, they took care of every tiny detail and the lesson commenced seamlessly. The menu was large, and we made EVERYTHING from scratch. With baskets in hand, we took a field trip to a close by market where she hand picked most of our ingredients. Her explanations, along with her wit and humor, never ceased. Her candidness about fresh, safe ingredients and the shortcuts restaurants in Thailand and all over the world was eye-opening and refreshing. She is a professional chef, un-ashamed of who she is and therefore accepting of everyone.I did my research before booking here, and several reviews said the food made in class was the best visitors had their whole trip. I cannot agree more! I am only saddened that here in the mid-west of the United States, recreating everything will be quite a challenge. It was my privilege during my 2-week stay in Bangkok to meet such a gem."

When I looked into attending a cooking class for our group of 8 that was visiting Bangkok, Chef Leez popped up on TA as one of the best reviewed. After taking her class it's obvious that she's definitely earned her top ratings. Her personality alone is worth the visit. She's quite the comedienne and a great teacher to boot. Her knowledge in Thai cuisine and preparation is extensive and we learned more in a few hours than I would have thought. It's also nice that she is quite philanthropic and has formed her own charity (Chef Leez Kidz) to help Thai children that have lost their parents and are in need of assistance.Her email communication is also great as when I booked the class, she emailed me back right away to suggest a private class for the 8 of us. It was a great suggestion and I'm glad we did it that way.My only suggestion would be to come hungry as you end up eating quite a lot between the soup and the main courses (I think I counted at least 6 dishes plus dessert.) The food is so fresh and fabulous - definitely one of our best meals all week! All in all a wonderful experience and one of my favorite activities while we were in Bangkok. Thanks Chef Lee!"

Chef LeeZ and her team were extremely welcoming and have made it a fun experience for my husband and I. The class started with a tour of a local \"hidden\" market where Chef LeeZ shared tips on how to pick quality products and what to watch out for in the markets and restaurants.Once back, we were taken on a whistle stop tour of 10 dishes with handy tips on how to bring out the best flavours in the food as well as how to make base ingredients (coconut cream/milk, shrimp oil and different curry pastes). I would encourage to be realistic about how much can be achieved in 3 hours. If you are looking for in-depth Thai cooking and doing your own chopping/prep, you may consider a longer private course. For a novice to Thai cuisine, this is a fantastic introduction and the Pad Thai I made has been the best I have tasted whist in Thailand. Chef Leez made it very clear from the start that only the best quality ingredients are used in her kitchen and this has really come through in the taste."

The day starts off with a visit to a local market where you will buy all the fresh produce you will use during the day. The chef herself does a good job explaining what to look for when buying something from the local markets and food stalls. I would recommend to do the cooking class in the beginning of your holiday so you can make the most out of these tips.You will prepare a wide array of Thai dishes. Don't worry, you won't be making everything from scratch. The cooks from the school will do a lot of prep work for you. This is a good thing since it could take a long while if everyone did everything on their own. On the other hand if you are an avid home cook like me, you would probably want to prepare all of your own stuff rather than just chucking the prepped ingredients to a pot. But again, I understand why they do it like this.The food was actually some of the best we ate during our whole stay in Thailand. I was especially surprised with the green curry. I thought I didn't care for green curry but that was just because I hadn't tasted a proper one. It became one of my favorite Thai dishes and I ordered it in several places after the class. I found only one that was as good as the one we made in the class.Fortunately we found the ingredients for the green curry back home as well. And thanks to Chef LeeZ cooking class I know how to cook it now!"

Chef Leez had already agreed to take some other students from the class to a supermarket, so my husband and I tagged along. She helped me pick out dried red chillis, tamarind, dried kaffir leaves, etc. Even though the ingredients were dried and Chef Leez warned me that the dishes I made \"would not taste the same,\" I figured having some ingredients was better than nothing. She was really helpful and stayed with us until the end, helping us flag a cab. I would take the class again in a heartbeat!Visited in May 2015"

The course was very well organised, with the very helpful (and unfortunately almost unacknowledged) assistants invisibly keeping the process well oiled and flowing smoothly. After a trip to the nearby market for some fresh ingredients, you get to create and sample 7 dishes, including 3 types of soup, 2 types of curry, a salad and a dessert, all of them being some of the best food I have tried in my time in Thailand."

She's funny, patient, very knowledgable, and wants this to be a life-changing experience. She even provides on-line support. The class is very organized and the assisting staff are great.My wife and I live by a simple eating rule: if Grandma won't recognize it, don't eat it. Chef LeeZ buys into this theory also and takes it a step further by stating don't be lazy and be careful with convenience...it leads to poorer food consumption. An example would be to use a 'mortar and pestle' instead of a blender, because of the nutritional benefits she explains. We strongly recommend taking Chef LeeZ Thai Cooking Course to anyone wanting a life-changing cooking experience and enjoys Asian cooking (not just Thai)!"

There's not a lot new that I can say about someone who has 600+ excellent reviews other than if you're looking for a Thai cooking class, this is the one. Cooking classes depending on a host with a good personality and Chef LeeZ fits the role perfectly. She's both knowledgeable and quick witted. We had a great time and definitely recommended!"

            "review": "Thai Cooking and Market trip. Just been to this cookery school here in amazing Bangkok. I was the first one to arrive having given myself one hour to get there from Nana area Sukumvit. It's not on a skytrain or MRT (underground) route so you will have to get a taxi or tuk-tuk. Having stayed in Bangkok for 2 weeks now on my own, I find the taxis are better than the tuk-tuk's. You get fed up of haggling the cost with the tuk-tuk drivers where-as you jump in a taxi, say 'taxi by meter' and you know where you are. (By in Thai language is 'go' but it's spelt, 'bpai' so it means 'go by meter, at least that's what I'm told, it worked every time for me)My hotel staff gave the taxi driver directions written in Thai, so that really helped. Even so we had to stop close by to get final instructions from a passer-by. Once in there you're greeted warmly by the attentive, ever efficient staff. More people arrived all nationalities. We soon got chatting as we made our way to the local market to have our first lesson understanding and buying Thai ingredients from local Thai people. The market is a fantastic treat. If you enjoy local markets there's another couple you should see called 'Khlong Toei' and 'Or to kor' Market. I've reviewed those ones separately. Chef Leez had an English code word when she picked up produce and said this was 'not good!' Or 'Mai dii' as they say here. You'll have to wait until you book to find out more. Chef is passionate about locally sourced and naturally produced products. (No MSG to be found!) Fab! I learned lots about Thai meat, fish, vegetables, different spices, ingredients and much more.Once back in the air-con, wi-fi available classroom we had our first lesson. Chef shows us how to add the ingredients, which had been carefully prepared by her team of helpers. Then explains in great detail how and when to add them. We all have our own cooking stations with separate, efficient gas burner, easy to operate too. You don't have to be a good cook either just turn up with an open mind a will to learn and lots of enthusiasm and you be fine! We cooked lots of different things and got to eat all of them. I like spicy food but other people in the group didn't, that was easily catered for. So if you're not a fan of hot spicy food no problem you will not be alone there. Equally, if you don't eat meat no problem either, that's taken care of. Plenty of bottled water on hand too. In conclusion, I really enjoyed the 4 hours at 'Cookery School' I met some fab fellow travellers, some couples and some people who were there alone, just like me. I even went for a beer with some of them after the course! I still keep in contact with them.You're not pressurised into buying recipes or anything else, but I did buy an apron to help the cause. I would recommend this course to anyone, you don't have to be 'Chef Ramsay' to go here. Hope it all makes sense, one other thing, there are lots of taxis waiting around to get you back to your hotel. Best wishes Chef Leez, I'll be back when the new school is open good luck, 'Chok Dii Khrub' Sawasdee Khrub and Khoup Khun Marre Khrub. Andrew Lloyd. Visited 18th January 2016"

My husband doesn't normally cook and was a little nervous at first, but LeeZ assistants provided a lot of prep support for our dishes but not so much that we didn't feel involved. The food was literally some of the best we ate while in Bangkok and we had a great time. I would recommend this to anyone!"

Chef Lee and her assistants are all great. Class starts with a visit to a small hidden local market. You will definitely learn some interesting food facts about Thai cooking and move on to chopping up some fresh ingredients and making your own dish! We made so many delicious dishes, some of the best food I had after traveling around for 2 weeks in Thailand. You will also get an email after the class for more free recipes too which is a huge plus after you sample your creations! Tip: arrange plenty of time to get here as you don't want to be late and miss a trip to the market. Traffic can be rough in Bangkok!"

The class itself includes making a soup, a curry, a salad, and a dessert, all in classic Thai style. You'll be anxious to get home to try her recipes (which she shares) out in your own kitchen."

Chef Leez emphasizes the importance of fresh ingredients for the best food. Every step was easy and concise, and Chef Leez is a great teacher.First we took a trip to a local market, where we learned how to find the best ingredients. I thought this was really cool because it showed how much Chef Leez wants her students to be able to cook these foods. Then we came back to the kitchen and started to cook! I expected to just make pad thai, but the class taught how to make about 10 different dishes! Chef Leez discussed with the class the different ingredients, how to prepare, etc. while her sous chefs actually did the preparation. Then everyone stepped up to a skillet and got to cook about 2-3 different dishes. And the food was PHENOMENAL. If you don't come out of the class with inspiration to cook, at the very least you'll eat a great meal!My mom, who is the chef in the family and the most excited for the class, had the best time. Chef Leez speaks great English, so nothing was lost in translation. She's also hilarious! Every step was simple enough to replicate at home. There was nothing too fancy or Bobby Flay about the experience; these dishes are simple and good. Chef LeeZ has a passion for cooking and a talent for teaching. She truly wants everyone to be able to make these foods at home. She even made a few extra dishes for my dad, who showed up the class towards the end to pick us up. I thought that was really sweet!Overall, I HIGHLY recommend Chef Leez Cooking Class! It's informative, fun, and delicious. One of the best ways to know a culture is to cook and eat the foods, so I think this was a great way to experience Thai culture."

The market tour was the highlight of the experience for me. She taught us what to look for, and what not to buy. The pad thai we made was the best I had in my 4 weeks in Thailand. The class I was in was quite crowded. It was a group of 12 in a narrow long kitchen. We all got individual attention and the class was very organized. However, everything happened so fast that if it weren't for me recording the process with my GoPro I might've forgotten most of it. The written recipe doesn't include the tips/tricks so you should definitely take notes or record with a video camera. I was so sad when my camera ran out of memory. I highly recommend coming with a friend or a significant other as most people come as a couple."

Ex. quick demo of how to make curry paste then we all make curry with pre-made paste and other ingredients portioned out for us. This made cooking much easier and very enjoyable but not as much of a learning experience. We were fine with this - we spent an enjoyable few hours learning about Thai cooking and ingredients, ate some delicious food and have some recipes and an idea of how to start if we want to try to recreate them."

It was fun to cook the thai food, and Chef Lee did a very good job of explaining everything and making the class exciting for my wife and I. We cooked a variety of dishes, which were all very tasty, and we had fun doing it. We went to the market and got food shopping advice as well, which was fun.The only problem with our class was that it seemed as though it had been overbooked. We got an email asking if we wanted to move to a smaller class later in the day, but we stayed with the morning one we had booked. I guess everyone did this as well, for there were close to twenty people in the small class. This may have been ok, but many of the other students seemed to want to be center stage and weren't too polite about getting that prime position. During the market visit, my wife and I were at the back of the group because we were there to enjoy, not to push others out of the way. A few of the students even showed up thirty minutes late, but Chef Leez entertained us while we waited by showing us the good and bad of food you can buy. I think she designed this part because she's used to people showing up late.Now, I understand that they are moving into a new location, which will hopefully be more spacious and things will be more organized. For the class I went to, it was overbooked, which shouldn't have happened in the first place, even if it was a busy season (Christmas). That is the only reason the class got four, not five, stars. Everything else seemed to be very good."

We went there after reading the great reviews in trip advisor and I have to say I'm not totally in line.The positive side of it is that the food cooked is really really great - some of the best eaten in Thailand.Also you learn loads of back info - like the making of pad thai sauce or the making of coconut sauce. The market visit is also great and Chef leeZ is just a very nice, fun, positive person.Now the negative - if you already know how to cook to a certain degree the amount of actual cooking is very little. This is due to 2 reasons: Firstly - most ingredients are preprepared. You of course add the ingredients to make the final dish, but the ingredients are only very quickly explained before adding them in to the pot; if I attend a class I just expect to 'cook from start to finish' - also because practice makes the chef ;)Secondly, our group was huge (ab. 20) and only 6 cooking stations were available. This meant a lot of waiting and sometimes a bit of chaos. While some cooked, others watched (time could have been used to prepare ingredients.)While in other classes I did, we were ab 6, all could choose from a list of dishes what to do and cooked those from scratch to finish in Chef LeeZ class this was just not manageable due to the size of the class.I have attended much better classes (in Chang Mai or Ho Chi Minh) which provided a very nice atmosphere, preparing dishes from scratch in small groups with lots of interaction with the chef- so I prefer that much more and learnt much more.Conclusion: If you only want to see how the dishes are prepared and get a first insight in thai cuisine and have a fun time - this is your class; but for experienced cookers or people who really want to learn how to cook thai, I would not recommend the class."

After a walk around Soi 1 we found it on the main road and then had a long discussion about the price of 2200 baht, and eventually settled on 1900 baht. This was not the best start and put me out immediately. Chef Leez is amiable and very talkative, but the course was not very long - there were only two of us. We were finished after 2 hours of cooking very tasty food. Nice, but not much for your money, considering the price of other services in Thailand."

She is by far one of the most nicest and genuine people I've met in Thailand (not like you can find many of those there!). I'm a frequent traveler to Bangkok, and I love Thai food. Although I am not a professional, I am a very good cook. But I realized I've been cooking Thai food wrong all this time although most of my guests found it fabulous.This lady is amazing; she teaches you 'real' home cooked Thai food. Most importantly she teaches you techniques that most chefs would not convey. She holds nothing back, and apparently enjoys imparting her knowledge to others. From picking the right ingredients at the local market to cleaning and cutting, she leaves no secrets behind! My husband who hardly cooks (or boil water!) joined me just to accompany me, enjoyed this course very much!She is witty, interesting and most of all full of knowledge and tips. She taught 8 items in just 4 hours and the 4 hours felt like a day because of all that I acquired! I have done numerous activities in and out of Bangkok, but I recommend this class to anyone who loves Thai food. It's only 4 hrs and worth so much more for the amount you pay! Dear Chef Lee, thank you for all that you taught me and I will see you again with more of my friends from Sri Lanka!"

We definitely agreed it was one of the best! Chef LeeZ puts an emphasis on how important it is to cook from zero, grandmother style, and it was absolutely surprising how much more tasty it is if you make something from scratch compared to buying it ready from the local store. I can keep writing more but the bottom line is that we loved it."

We booked the cooking class after reading all the wonderful reviews on Tripadvisor. The class was about 35 minutes away from our hotel and getting around in Bangkok is not easy and difficult to time with the traffic. But we made it in time. I would suggest Uber. It was a great resource for us during our time in Bangkok. Chef LeeZ is understanding and accounts for travel time. She starts the class with an informative introduction to the class and doesn't leave straight for the market at 10AM. The market was neat to see and learn all the ingredients to purchase and which to stay away from. We found this not just informative for our time in Thailand but it was also a lesson we could take home with us. She taught us how to make some of the more popular Thai dishes like pad thai and curry. But the best part of the class was eating. We were stuffed. It was really some of the best Thai food we ate on our trip. Chef LeeZ and her staff were well prepared and you could tell it wasn't their first rodeo. I would recommend this class to everyone. If we return we will be taking another one of Chef Leez cooking classes."

The experience was fantastic!! we discovered many different odours (some of them good and other not much), and how was the real Thai market, not the prepared tourist ones.After the market, with our baskets plenty of vegetables, prawns, and more, we continued the class in the school.The local is very clean and you have all that you could need for the dishes.All of us cooked the dishes while The Chef with her helful and cheerful assistants teaching us.Leez is a very cheerful person. She explains very well the dishes and in every moment is pending of you. She do the clases very pleasant with many examples and comparisons between the Thai and European ingredients.The clase flew by without we noticed! and with our bellys full after eating all the dishes that we had prepared.Seriously, if you want to know how to prepare Thai meal, know the ingredients and spend a funny time don't doubt! meet The Chef Leez."

Her assistants in the kitchen were on the spot and always had items prepped for us to use. Overall this was a great experience. I would recommend it to everyone. I think at this point I have a good foundation to make honest efforts at authentic Thai cuisine. After the class it was just a short cab ride over to Wat Pho.

With that, everywhere I travel, I try to take a cooking class to help bring a piece of that into my life. You can look at the architecture, take pictures of the buildings and scenery, and buy the souvenirs. But personally, I've found that if you can take from your vacation a piece of a cultures food, you can relive and share a piece of those memories. On my recent vacation, I took two cookng classes. I wanted to see what the difference between a top ranked cooking class vs a mediocre one would be like. Chef LeeZ has a lot of experience teaching these classes and you can tell. She has it down to an art. Everyting moves perfectly like clock-work, very fluid and with a great pace. She's engaging in her knowledge and background to help you understand the \"why's\" of what you're doing and how to do it. I think as a standard, she's also entertaining. This is critical in a crash course cooking class you are taking in a foreign country. So with that said, I think the key aspects of a successful cooking class was there.Now when I compare her class with other classes I've taken: If you Really want to learn how to make some of the common traditional dishes, This is the class for you. I went to one of her competitors and they did teach the class, and although it was also hands on, if I objectivly compare the two, I definitly felt that I learned more and felt more confident after Chef LeeZ class. The other class I went to was also great, but it had some differences. Not to spend too much time talking about the other course, but it was more of an experience and hands down my photos there were much better. However, educationally, I'd rank it much lower. Chef Leez class had more of an industrial/academic feel to it, because of how it is setup: Of course with some fun info and stories included. But that being said, It was set up to Learn how to really make the different dishes. If you really want to learn how to make the dishes and be entertained, this is the class for you. I'd say 85% education 15% fun On top of that, the food tasted better here than at the other class I took.I definitly understand why this class is ranked number 1 on Trip Advisor"

The staff at Chef Leez contacted me immediately through email and I was given a refund within days. I was very impressed. Unfortunately, my husband and I had to cancel our trip also and I contacted Chef Leez again for another refund of my pre-paid reservation. I was a little apprehensive, but they were again so accommodating and processed a refund to me. I appreciate the efficient and caring manner in which they handled my circumstances. I will be traveling to Thailand in February and will definitely be taking this course then. "

On a recent trip to Thailand I followed TripAdvisor's suggestion to try a cooking class and decided on top-rated Chef LeeZ Cooking School. While I can't compare it to other cooking classes in Bangkok, I cannot imagine any experience topping our experience with Chef LeeZ.We started the day by being taken to the local market, where we were taught how to pick proper, fresh ingredients for natural cooking. Back in the classroom, we received step-by-step instructions and demonstrations and were able to cook about a dozen dishes by ourselves. Every single dish that we cooked in this class was fresh and flavorful and everything down to the sauces were made by hand. The food we ate in class was hands-down the best food we ate during our entire trip in Thailand.Chef LeeZ was incredibly knowledgable, friendly, and helpful. One man in the class made an off-handed comment about his favorite Thai dish (which wasn't on the menu for what we'd be making that day), and Chef LeeZ immediately added it to our schedule to appeal to his taste. I cannot say enough good things about this class--if you are ever in Bangkok you are making a mistake if you miss out on this experience!"

Chef LeeZ and her team have planned and prepared the class so that not only ten different dishes are prepared, cooked and tried in three hours, but also preparing, cooking and trying alternates. The class is not only instructive regarding authentic local ingredients and preparation, but also relaxed and fun. It is amazing how Chef LeeZ seems also to enjoy giving classes although she runs them on a daily basis."

You can easily tell she loves wha she does and the seamless execution from her staff was very impressive.You'll start off by going to the market to pick up produce, here Chef Leez explains what to look for and what best to buy (my god the produce was so cheap compared to what we pay for back home!). I got a mosquito bite at the market and Chef Leez whipped up an organic paste out of oil and nuts to put on my bite which stopped it from itching!! :)She believes in being true to your ingredients as all the recipes stayed clear from processed goods. We even got to make our own coconut cream and milk! Do yourself a favour, if you have half a day to spare do do do this class. You can thank me later!"

She has a great personality and we're still using some of her catch phrases: \"Grandma not lazy!\" \"Everything money!\" and \"Bea-u-tiful!\" (her code word at the market meaning this is artificial crap made to just look pretty) Loved that she had different people make different variations of dishes so that we got to taste an even wider variety.

When we first arrived we were a bit put off by the location but we're soon at ease once we got into things. The visit to the market is pretty disgusting and it's hard to tell who runs it - the cats climbing all over everything or the vendors if ignoring them - either way you will definitely be glad your with Chef Leez as she only picks the best produce, knows her way around the market and obviously speaks thai, all very useful in this situation. The dishes cooked include soups, Pad thai, green curry, massaman curry and desserts. The course is a tiny bit too long for my taste (4 hours in total) and probably could benefit from some more interaction between attendees, perhaps more of a communal dinner experience towards the end would be especially handy if you are wanting to meet fellow travelers but if you want the option to only speak to the person you came with course this will probably suit you. I'm looking forward to trying out these dishes at home"

What I liked most is they let us make substitutions and exclusions from our dishes. For example, I hate mushrooms, and they were ok with that. They also took care of people with food allergies.We haven't tried the recipes at home, but when we eat Thai at home we now have an appreciation for the cuisine."

Chef Leez took us to a local food market and taught us how she shops for vegetables, herbs and shrimp. Her basic rule is that if it is \"BEAUTIFUL\" she will not buy it. You will need to go to one of her lessons to find out why! We learnt how to make the different types of curries, pad Thai and Tom Yum. It was very interesting for us since we can find the ingredients she uses in our local markets. She showed us how to make coconut milk from a raw coconut but using this old fashion tool and also showed us how to prepare whole seeds for spices. All the men in the group indicated that they liked spicy foods so she had them prepare the spiciest of the food recipes. We had to open the doors of the shop as everyone started choking and laughing at the same time it was quite hilarious! After the class my husband expressed interest in purchasing one of the coconut tools and the mortar for grinding spices. She offered to take us to the China Town Market area to purchase. It was a good thing as I am sure we would have failed in finding and negotiating for it. We ended up purchasing both items and tonight we are making our first true Thai food back home using her techniques and recipes. Chef Leez is truly engaged and cares about what she teaches - you will not be disappointed. You will also receives her recipes and options to get more on line free of charge. This is an memory which will continue on with each dish we prepare at home. Thanks Chef Leez."

Also, for those people saying she was saying rude jokes towards vegetarians, mustn't really understand Thai people very well. She was very charming and welcoming and any form of jolliness is just the culture. And as for people who are leavin rerviews about her 'slating' other things in Bangkok - she is telling the truth, you are there to learn about cooking in Thailand - she is there to teach you.

The class starts with a market visit where she explains the available ingredients and how to choose wisely. The light bulb moment was when she explains how we shouldn't choose \"beautiful\" ingredients as these are probably full of chemicals such as fertilizers, preservatives, and colorings and we should choose less than perfect ones as well as natural looking ones. We then proceed back to the classroom where we learned how to make pastes and its various uses in Thai cuisine, curries, pad Thai, clear and creamy tom yum, mango sticky rice, holy basil chicken, green papaya salad and even a bonus tom kha gai. We also get access to her recipe club for even more dishes to learn. This is the best value you can get from any cooking class in Bangkok!

She is one of the most sweet, kind and passionate women, who truly loves what she does. Her enthusiasm is infectious. We started with a trip to the local markets, seeking out the freshest, tastiest ingredients. The first dish was a two versions of tom yum, one clear and one creamy. Then we whipped up a delicious pad thai that was so light and fresh, putting anything at your local thai resto to shame. Following that was an introduction to curries and the small tweaks needed to make a red, green, penang or mussuman curry. We made two versions of mussuman, one with beef and one with prawns. Then the boys got stuck into cooking up the green curry and chicken fried with basil. All seriously delicious! Finally we made a quick light and fresh papaya green salad with a proper kick of heat. A sticky rice and mango dessert helped cool our hot mouths down. The thing I liked most was Chef Leez's insistence on using the most pure ingredients, and using as much of each thing as possible (prawn brains to make vibrant red oils that added so much flavour to our soups) she really believes in minimising waste and cooking as economically as possible without sacrificing flavour. Highly recommended. You will not regret joining one of Chef Leez's fantastic classes. The food may well be the best you eat on your trip to Bangkok."

My boyfriend and I took part in the group class and, so far, it is one of the highlights of our trip. We both felt like it was definitely geared towards tourists (nothing challenging or advanced), but that's not a bad thing! You get to make (and eat) delicious food and Chef Lee is a very fun teacher. It's a great experience for the money; one we'd be happy to do again.To begin with, getting to the school is very easy as it is on a main road. Follow Chef Lee's instructions for taking a taxi (provided on her website!) and it will not cost more than 100 baht (less than $3.00 each way).The class starts with a trip to a local market, which was a great experience all by itself. The market was located down an alley; definitely a place tourists don't wander on their own! Chef Lee takes the class around, explaining popular Thai ingredients and how to tell with ones are the best (\"is beautiful, but is not healthy!\") It's a lot of fun to watch Chef Lee interact with the vendors, who obviously know her well.Once back in the classroom, we were given a whirlwind of instruction, covering eight dishes in under four hours. You do spend some time watching Chef Lee or other students, as the group class has more students than it does cooking stations. However, this was not a problem for my boyfriend and me because it meant one of us could learn, watch, even take pictures while the other one cooked. You get to eat everything you make and Chef Lee provides all of the recipes as well.Overall, I think this is a GREAT class for the price. I wouldn't have minded more hands on cooking, but I feel like I got a little experience prepping and cooking. Chef Lee also answers any questions you have--take advantage of that! We would consider taking a semi-private class next trip, just to get more hands on experience with Chef Lee."

For me the best was the pad thai and the green curry, best food we have eaten in Bangkok. Chef Leez is a brilliant instructor, warm, very funny and knowledgeable. I can highly recommend this for a day in bangkok."

You make soup, 2 different curries, Pad Thai, stir fry & mango & sticky rice eating each dish as you make it. Can't wait to get home & make the dishes myself- the only downside? Haven't had any food as good during the rest of our Thailand trip. Thank you Chef Lee for a great day."

I wanted to ask more. Everything we cooked was delicous! I love the tips she shared. Good thing I took notes. I want to go back if we ever go back to Thailand. I understand how some people could be offended by some of the things she said about restaurants or the taxi drivers but she's just stating facts so im ok with that.

Although we arrived late, Chef Leez's assistant had no problem escorting us to the nearby market where the rest of the class was out shopping for the lesson's meals. We walked to the market where we were met by Chef Leez who was enthusiastically describing all the items she was purchasing. She gave a lot of tips regarding what to buy and what to stay away from. It was obvious she cared about the quality and health of all her ingredients. When it came time to cook, we all paired with our companions and we each got a turn to cook. We were given aprons and a recipe book to guide us as we followed her. All of the dishes we made were delicious. I'm not used to shrimp paste as I have an aversion to cooking with shrimp brains and such, but it was surprisingly tasty when she spread it on a piece of bread. My favorite was the sticky rice topped with mango slices and coconut milk. Chef Leez, if you're reading this, I didn't appreciate the black joke that you made that day. You said that during one summer, you tanned a lot and your family made fun of you for it. You also said that it made you look ugly. I saw in your eyes the moment you realized what you said when you looked at me and my husband and said \"Oh, but not you! You're beautiful!\" I'm not offended in the least, but saying things like that is rude. Nonetheless, I had a great time and enjoyed myself so much that I bought one of Chef Leez's aprons as a souvenir. Unfortunately, I ended up with the runs a half hour upon leaving the class. I suppose shrimp paste doesn't agree with me after all."

The location is easy to find, but allow 30-40 min of standing in traffic if you are coming from Sukhumvit 11 (Nana station). I would recommend getting a metered taxi for it. DON'T TAKE A TUK TUK! The class starts by going to the market to pick out the ingredients you'll use for the day. Chef LeeZ does a fantastic job of educating the students on what high-quality vs. ordinary/cheap ingredients are. This by itself was great to hear and made the class worth the little bit of a premium. Next you cook a series of traditional Thai dishes. Luckily we cooked all of my favorite - tom yum goon, green curry, masaman curry, and sticky rice mango. Chef Leez is quite funny, but I think it's a function of how many people get her jokes - I was the only one laughing in my class...The class starts promptly at 10am and ends at 2pm and she makes sure you have a reliable way to get to your next destination."

We signed up for a 4-hour cooking class and arrived to the classroom around 10am. We were invited in to a clean and organized cooking area, and Chef Leez wasted no time jumping right in to our day of cooking. We took a trip to a local, hidden market where we purchased fresh ingredients and got to see the where the locals shop. (A great opportunity for photographs of local produce and seafood, meat, etc). We headed back to class and began cooking up over seven dishes which we were able to sample after we cooked. Real, authentic, fresh meals. We made coconut milk and cream by hand, no canned or packaged stuff here. Chef Leez is all about the real deal, no artificial ingredients or MSG. She wants you to know where the flavor comes from and puts real heart into her work. She is a dynamic, funny, engaging and informative teacher. We learned so much but we had so much fun! If you are looking for a cooking class in Bangkok, seriously, look no further! This was hands down my best experience in Bangkok and a great way for me to show my mum more of Thailand."

I've been to BKK for the umpteenth time & was really looking for something special instead of the usual eat, shop, massage. It was such a fruitful session & hence, I'm giving my first review on TA to this class. The 4hour group session with Chef LeeZ, her kitchen helpers & my classmates were very well spent. We had so much fun visiting the local market, learning about fresh produce as well as how to prepare some cool local dishes. Chef LeeZ or sometimes known as grandma is a super hip lady who reminded me about one of my late Home Econs teacher from Secondary school. The lesson was well planned, well executed & well paced. You're free to take photos, videos etc. at anytime - it really caters to people like me who find it a great challenge retaining information. A handout of things to note & recipes will be compiled & given to every student. I went with my hubs but not to worry if you're a solo traveller or wish to have fun learning with a group of friends.. At the end of the day, you'll leave her cooking school with an awesome experience of cooking the Thai way & perhaps even got acquainted with some new mates from all over the world - Philippines, Aussie, Austrians, Singaporeans etc. "

I honestly didn't know how we'd get everything done suggested on the menu; 3 soups, 3 curries, green papaya salad and stick rice with mango after learning how to prep the basic pastes for soup and curry. Fantastic. Two men who fancied themselves at cooking and a complete rookie who never picked up a spatula in his life, had a ball in a mixed class.Would absolutely return to Chef's class on my next inbound. After two hours - halfway in - my head was spinning and belly filling with the best-tasting Thai food I've ever eaten, period.

Our visit to the local market to buy fresh ingredients was an intimate experience of Bangkok that you wouldn't have unless you were a local. Chef Lee often referred to how to do things the authentic way without using preservatives or processed ingredients, just fresh fresh fresh. We 'experienced' the creation of so many dishes rather than actually cooking them all, that is, we had a bit of help with the preparation, otherwise you just couldn't create all of those dishes in 4 hours. But we covered enough detail to do it ourselves at home subject to equipment and ingredients being available. It was great to eat mangoes in May! I highly recommend this cooking class."

My wife is a very good cook, and this was a great experience for her, and she picked up a few handy tips. I just had fun!The other element which i really liked was that Lee has a \"charity\" which supports disadvantaged kids. Lee is obviously successful in her filed, and that she is putting her success to the benefit of others is very laudable.If you are looking for a fun cooking school experience in Bangkok you could do far worse that going to see Chef Lee."

We did everything from scratch -- no instant or prepared sauces; but she does give options and alternatives particularly for those who live in countries where the ingredients are not readily available. Her classes are definitely value for money. She presents 8 to 9 dishes for the three-hour class, compared to four dishes of other classes. I will definitely take another class when I get back to Bangkok."

After all it is Thailand. I've actually been a student of Chef Leez from a previous visit to Thailand so I knew the lopes. I was not to be denied. Actually she had no students scheduled for her morning class. I was greeted warmly, paid my 1,900 baht tuition (approx. $61. USD) and received a private one-on-one class with Chef Leez. This is an educational as well as hands-on cooking experience in which students get to eat as much as they like of all food prepared. In addition Chef Leez leads a short field trip down to the local market to examine and discuss produce and talk with the merchants. Chef Leez speaks very good English so communication is not a problem. She offers an assortment of dishes to prepare during class that include appetizers, entrees and desserts. I returned to class a second time to understand more of the details as Thai food ingredients and preparation was all new to me. The results are delicious simple, fresh clean tastes that are much better than anything you find in the states. The only difficulty I suspect will be finding all the fresh ingredients which are prevalent all over Thailand. Chef Leez makes you feel welcome. Class is fun and interesting. Try it for something out of the ordinary."

She speaks good English, she is funny, she references cooking with \"grandma\" a lot (her recipes are from her grandmother who used to own a restaurant), and she is focused on the best, healthiest, freshest ingredients! The trip to the local market (folks, this is a true local market...very small, no way you would ever find it on your own) was both informative and entertaining. The cooking class was very hands on, and Chef Leez took care to explain every ingredient. I am a terrible cook...really terrible...and even I was able to follow. However, I did manage to spill my food once and burn my hand on the wok (classic form for me - accident prone), and Chef Leez took care of me. She had some lotus cream that she put on my hand for the burn, and it was like it never even happened...I have been looking for that cream ever since! I am also glad that we took the class near the beginning of our trip...Chef Leez gave us some tips on what to wat h out for when eating street food...very helpful! Also, folks...I have to add...this was, by far, the BEST Thai food that I have ever had in my life!!!!!!!! No joke. Nothing we have had since then has compared. If not for the cooking, just go to eat!!! You will not regret it...definitely the highlight of our time in Bangkok. Thank you, Chef Leez!"

It was delightful learning how to cook with new fresh ingredients and then eating each dish after it was prepared. Chef LeeZ has a perfect personality for this business - knowledgeable, organized, fun, fun, fun. We highly recommend Chef LeeZ and will go back to her school for another class if we ever have the pleasure of being back in Bangkok."

Not only does Chef LeeZ teach you to make some of the most amazing and delicious Thai food, but she also shows you how to get the best ingredients for your meals. She makes it a family friendly experience with a lot of love and caring to which you can tell she dedicates her services to. She teaches you techniques and family secrets that only a Grandma and Grandpa would show you. She also does a wonderful job of involving the youngest of chefs, as she did with our two daughters (8 & 6 years old). Our daughters were amazed that they were able to prepare Thai food that even they wanted to eat! By far, the best cooking school experience I have ever had. One note of caution: you will never look at Thai food the same way. Chef Leez raises the bar to a 5 star experience! If our schedules permitted, I would attend Chef Leez Thai Cooking School again. She makes you feel right at home and what better way to do so with yummy Thai food!"

Chef Lee gave us a crash course in the basics including taking us to a small local market for a tutorial on the raw ingredients and to buy the ones we would be cooking. In the space of 4-5 hours we had learned how to prepare and cook 8 classic dishes - and eat them. We had great fun and staggered away full at the end of it. We can't wait to start getting the recipes in the future. Only downside we now know how it should be done properly - and the short cuts and cost savings taken by many restaurants. So we may be less happy with what we are served in future."

Luckily I got the last spot. It's only 8 people. I'm a guy and love to cook. I had an awesome time. After 3 weeks of eating amazing Thai food I wanted to take home knowledge to recreate some of my favorites. In just half a day Chef Leez shows you how to buy produce from a local market, tells you what to look for when buying seafood, what types of ingredients we can find at home that AREN'T fully processed with bad ingredients...Oh and the 8+ dishes of food we made from scratch too. Come hungry...basically you can skip breakfast and you'll leave with a huge smile, fully belly, authentic recipes, and the know-how to recreate them at home. Highly recommend if you like Thai food, like to cook, and want to bring home more than just pictures and trinkets for friends. Cook your friends at home one of the many dishes you will learn."

How to pick the freshest and most natural ingredients, that many products we buy from markets and stores have added chemicals, msg or do not use pure ingredients etc. The class was interactive but not overwhelmingly so. I actually learn best by watching, reading and writing rather than doing so it was great that I got to watch Chef or other students cook first so that I could write down important tips or notes. She also let us film and take photos during the class. Our class was just the right size - 6 people. The food we cooked was actually the best tasting thai food I had on my trip. Can't wait to make everything again at home. It is definitely worth doing if you're in Bangkok and you enjoy eating and cooking."

She introduced us some local ingredients, and the tricks to pick fresh and healthy ingredients. What substitutes we can use when we replicate the dishes at home. To cook each dishes, Chef will first go thru all ingredients with us, we can touch and smell the special herbs being used. And then, she will demonstrate how to do the prep works, then show us the cooking procedures. We will then go to our station and cook our own dishes. We learnt a total of 12 recipes during class! 1, 2) Spicy Sour Soup (Clear and Creamy) 3) Pad Thai 4) Green Curry Chicken 5) Tom Yum Paste 6,7,8) Green\\Red\\Yellow Curry Paste 9) Holy Basil Chicken 10) Ma-sa-man Curry Chicken11) Green Papaya Salad 12) Sticky Rice Mango All of them taste YUM!Chef can speak very good English, so no worry it may be difficult to communicate. What impressed us is we are making most of the dishes from scratch (making own coconut cream, coconut milk, curry paste, etc.) I believe Chef herself has a very healthy lifestyle, as she kept on emphasizing the importance of using good ingredients (why coconut oil, palm sugar is good for cooking; avoid using MSG, always use fresh lime juice, etc.) We always want to cook fresh and healthy meals for our family, so we loved the way she taught, really practical! My boyfriend was a bit sick when we had the class, his stomach not feeling too well. Chef made him and the rest of the class some drinks with herbs. It was a nice offer :).

It was also nice to learn about the local eating habits and ingredients (including how to get 100% coconut milk. Clue: you can't buy it). Chef Lee is very entertaining and made a lot of jokes to keep the class engaged.The registration process was simple and we got very helpful directions to find the place. There was a Canadian (?) guy who was responsible for the logistics and business side of things, so there was no problem with communication.Some feedback for the team:1. Cut the market portion - I've been to a lot of Asian markets and this was not one worth seeing. We kept getting interrupted by motorcyclists and merchants biking and moving things into the narrow entryways. Also, the market was filthy and hot. I understand that lots of foreigners like seeing it, but I honestly think that the introduction of ingredients can be done elsewhere.2. Too much talking and not enough cooking - Having been to other cooking classes before, I felt that the lecture portion went on for far too long. We did not start cooking until 11:30am (when class started at 10) and I would have preferred diving in right away.3. Too little food - I like that we get to eat our food right away (as opposed to waiting till the end.) However, the portions are too tiny! The pad thai literally had 4 noodles, and it was not enough! I realise that they probably did this to avoid making us too full, but I was hungry still after the class. I would be willing to pay more for more food.Given these complaints, I would rate this as more of a 3.5 or 4 star experience. However, knowing the TA rating system for activities skews towards 5 stars, I am leaving a 5 star to avoid screwing the business over."

It was difficult deciding between all the classes on offer but finally decided on Chef Leez after reading TA reviews. The entire structure of class is casual, friendly and packed with information. From visit to market to the final dessert Chef Leez was a perfect coach & guide. Her manner of teaching techniques and selection of ingredients is what makes the class special. Her attention to each & every student is amazing. My teen daughter, who was earlier a bit wary of coming with me, ended up absolutely loving it. We made 8 dishes and the only part that we did not do ourselves was apportioning ingredient portions. This is a 100% hands-on class in spite of the large number of dishes on menu. And no short cuts - every paste was ground by us. The takeaway from the class is huge for me & my daughter. We learnt things which we can use in our daily cooking to produce great results. But I would give five stars to this class for Chef Leez alone. What a warm & wonderful person she is. From coming to pick us up from where the can stopped to finding us a can after class and making my daughter feel special amongst all adults, she really made our day. We will always have fond memories of this class."

For I had only time on the same day I just stayed there. Another couple was coming so we are just 3 keen learners. It turned out that we have met before at MBK therefore we had so much to laugh about from the start. Lee explained all the ingredients and what to avoid buying. How to discern good products from bad once aso. She was really brilliant in the way she taught us what and how to make the most delicious meals. We had also so much fun and she had sometimes to keep us in line in accordance with the schedule.Anyway go there for the best place to learn how to cook properly Thai meals. I still compare all the dishes with the once we had at her school. And not one of the curries I ate are close to the taste of them from Lee's cooking school.Thanks Lee"

Anyone can provide you with a bunch of ingredients and show how to make a Thai dish as knowing is half the battle( Go Joe!); but what sets this class apart is that it allows you to understand why things are done a paticular way. You will have a new apprection for the Thai cusine and how can you pass that up? Take this class, it's well worth both the time and money. It's one the best things I've done this trip."

Chef takes you through the basics of Thai flavours, a short trip around the local market (and I mean local, you would never know it was there and our hotel was right next door), and then it's down to business.The ingredients acquired from the market are then used to make pastes, coconut cream and milk, curries, Pad Thai, stir fry, sticky rice and salads. You get a handy recipe handout to take away and the course really gives you an insight into how you can make amazing Thai food at home, without using packaged sauces and additives. We ate 2 soups and 5 plates of food, there is definitely no need for breakfast! We would definitely recommend a course here."

You will make a lot of different food and it is so delicious! Some of the best thai food I had. And you get to make it! She also shows you how to modify dishes to make things not even listed on the itinerary. For example, we made two soups and then she showed us how to modify the recipe of one and make a third, Tom Kha Gai. We also made green curry and massaman curry but she also taught us how to modify the recipes to make red, yellow and panang curries. You essentially learn a lot of how to make a lot of different types of Thai food in a short amount of time. You eat ALOT though, so come hungry."

She's incredibly passionate about Thai cooking and her enthusiasm is infectious. Best of all, Chef LeeZ was sharing recipes her Grandma had taught her as a kid, and it was a big bonus for us that she is pro-organic and anti-msg too. It was great to visit a local market to gather our ingredients - it was a very local market, definitely not one a tourist would normally visit, almost invisible from the street. We learned to make some of our favourite dishes and are now officially ruined for anything but homemade Pad Thai forever, it was THAT good! Recipes are provided and questions are welcome. Chef LeeZ is particularly good at suggesting substitute ingredients in your home country too. Oh, and we got to eat everything we made, so skip breakfast or eat light!

The class seems to have a maximum of 8 places, only 7 people on the day we were there, so there is lots of 1-on-1 attention and the chance to cook several dishes, then eat them :-)The cost is really good, about \u00a330 each, which covers all the food and recipes.

I paid online late the night before and woke up to find a confirmation email. Easy! There were only 2 other people doing the class that day, so it was a nice personal experience. We had an introduction from Chef Lee, who was very charming and good fun. We walked to a nearby food market to buy some ingredients for our dishes. We were told lots of interesting stuff about the ingredients and especially about how bad some are and how lazy Thai cooking has become but I'll talk more about that later. We cooked a wide variety of dishes. You don't cook every single dish on the list, some are cooked by your fellow students and some by Chef Lee. By spreading out the cooking it means you get to sample more dishes in the 4 hours. During the initial introduction I mentioned Jungle Curry and as a result it was added in to the mix of curries we cooked. It was delicious and could definitely be part of the repertoire. By the end you are very very full. I didn't even have breakfast and I struggled to finish everything. This isn't a bad thing at all, just a tip for making sure you're hungry and that you might want to avoid finishing some of the early dishes. Overall it was a really enjoyable class. I have previously done similar classes at Pum's (Koh Phi Phi) and Time for Lime (Koh Lanta). I think my favourite was Time for Lime but there isn't too much between them. However, Chef Lee and her Canadian husband seemed to be on a mission to repeatedly say that most (if not all) Thai cooking is now lazy and uses inferior produce and cuts corners at the expense of taste and health. Multiple times we were told that you are very unlikely to taste food as good as theirs anywhere in the whole of Thailand! Of course this is absolute rubbish. This is my 3rd trip to Thailand and I've had some seriously amazing food, especially outside of Bangkok. I can understand that they are proud of what they're doing and they want to boast about it but it seemed as if they we honestly deluded in to thinking their cooking really is the best in Thailand. A fun experience and one that I would recommend :) "

Chef Lee takes the time to explain different ingredients & how to find the good ones and steal clear of chemically produced \"stuff\". Unlike other cooking class where the curry paste or shrimp stock for example are already prepared for you, Chef Lee explains clearly how it's done. You even make your own coconut cream and milk (and get to taste and compare with the industrial stuff, wow, soooo much better). It's a really enjoyable experience and you realize how creative and fun Thai cooking is. Just beware, you are going to eat. A lot.Don't take any breakfast and be sure to arrive hungry!The cooking school is quite easy to find as long as you have a map of Bangkok, and I recommend you keep their phone close (my taxi driver was completely lost).Thank you very much for this great moment Chef Lee!"

Chef Leez is passionate about healthy, proper ingredients and shared her knowledge and tips the whole way through the course. Our market trip was a proper food-buying expedition and she told us not only about what we bought, but what else was available. When it came to the cooking itself, it was fun to learn about the best way to use different ingredients and feel like we were getting our hands dirty (learning how to extract coconut cream was lots of fun!).The important part of a cooking course is, of course, the food. Which was universally amazing in this case! Every dish was better than the last and it almost ruined Thai food for me, because nothing else would taste as good! You get all the recipes to take home and it's not impossible to source the ingredients back home. Can't wait to try them out myself!"

We were visiting Bangkok with our very picky and not food-adventurous daughter, ages 7 and 8, and decided to try a cooking class in hopes that having a hand in the creation of some new foods, that they would at least try them. We chose Chef Lee because of the great reviews she had on Tripadvisor, and I have to say, she did NOT disappoint! Not only was she sweet and engaging, even after the little ones had started to lose interest (the class is generally a little over two hours so this was to be expected) but the food was AWESOME. Her recipes are simple but delicious and she cooks in a very healthy style, using very little oil which really impressed me. Each of us had our own prep and cooking station with perfectly apportioned ingredients so that each of us had the full experience of creating the dishes - I think 8 in all which was impressive! I don't know if it will be as simple to recreate them at home but I will definitely try! What a great find! Chef Lee ROCKS!"

This class was a great mix of cooking instruction and culture. Before you even begin cooking, Chef Leez takes you to the local market for ingredient shopping. She explains everything and also goes into what can be purchased in the States and what will have to be substituted. We made Pad Thai, Curry (green and yellow), Chicken, Tom Yum Paste, Tom Yum Soup, Mango Sticky Rice, and Papaya Salad.She has amazing assistants who help prepare the ingredients so when you start cooking, you are good to go. She spaces the class out so the time flies and you are laughing and enjoying your own food. My husband and I were stuffed at the end of the class. We will never see Thai food the same again. We learned how restaurants use so much sugar and ketchup to dye and sweeten the food unnecessarily. Chef Leez taught us how to use all natural ingredients and the secret tips used by real Thai cooks to naturally color food with shrimp paste. The moment I returned back to the States, I told all my friends about this cooking class.I recommend this to ANYONE who visits Thailand."

As it turned out, it was a highlight of the weekend. First off, the market tour was invaluable in being able to go home and try to replicate what we had learned. It was great fun seeing all the gorgeous veggies. Chef Leez is obviously very picky about the quality of her ingredients - something that became a theme for the lesson as we used fresh, not canned, coconut milk, for example. Chef Leez's helpers were also awesome - always smiling and helping us and showing us how to do things. As another reviewer said, the only problem was that the food we made was so delicious, it spoiled us for the rest of the trip as we couldn't help compare what we were eating to what we had cooked ourselves. I can't recommend this enough and is really fun as a couples activity."

The only problem with this class is that you will make pad Thai so incredibly good it will ruin your ability to enjoy pad Thai anywhere else for the rest of your trip!! My boyfriend and I attended this class and were pleased to find it was only 4 people. We started with a market visit which was very enjoyable. One of my favorite parts of the class was the emphasis on healthy and fresh foods. Everything we made was delicious with the highlight being the Pad Thai, also the chili paste and soups were second favorites. I will say the class is on the expensive side, but we did quite a bit and I was full at the end. I am vegetarian and I had no problem as mushrooms and tofu were easily substituted for me.I will say that if I was doing it again I might have gone for the half class. It is a little cheaper and you still cover a good range of dishes. Also, most of the learning was done on these dishes, the second half of the class felt much more rushed and was more of just quickly throwing the precut things together so we could finish it all and eat. I didn't mind so much because the food was still good, but I would have been fine just doing the half class as well.Either way it was a great day and the everyone at the school is incredibly friendly and nice to meet."

Luckily for our party of 2, the other participants failed to turn up during our 4hr lesson (on Sat 21st June 10am>2pm) meaning that ours was effectively a private lesson - which was a bonus as it meant Chef Leez was able to spend more time and be more attentive to our individual efforts and questions relating to the food, preparation techniques and cooking.The cookery school (effectively a shop front) is well laid-out, spacious, extremely clean (with stainless steel worktops for the food preparation) and nicely air-conditioned \u2013 thoroughly appreciated in Bangkok in June!The number of dishes that were included in the lesson initially seemed quite a lot - but actually worked out quite well with enough time to prepare, cook, photograph (don't forget your camera!) and devour all of them. This was mainly due to a majority of the major food preparation (washing \\ peeling etc) being taken care of by Leez's right-hand lady and on-site Commis chef who was generally out-of-sight, hardly seen and never heard - but always on-hand to tidy-up after us and provide the next set of carefully measured ingredients).The dishes that we were soon rustling-up like pros were made using many of the organic ingredients that Chef Leez purchased from the nearby local neighbourhood market at the beginning of our lesson \u2013 which itself was a fantastic experience full of unusual sights, smells and market produce that tourists like us are unlikely to see without a guide like Chef Leez to take us \u2018round. This 30min market tour was a great opportunity for Chef Leez to point out the basic set of ingredients needed to produce quality Thai cuisine, including what to look for when choosing healthy & authentic market produce \u2013 and avoiding that which is full of the artificial ingredients and additives available in many of the items on sale.Based on the structure of the lesson, Chef Leez experience-led knowledge, the content of lesson, Chef Leez as the host, and the clean premises, I would definitely recommend this cookery school and rate it as one of the most enjoyable ways to spend a morning in Bangkok.

They seemed surprised.Throughout the cooking class references were made to my veganism constantly. \"Okay everyone, put you're chicken in the bowl now, except you, because you're vegan, you can put in mushroom, because you are vegan\" kind of thing. It was slightly annoying and the class was very meat-orientated. The staff did not know who was meat eater/non-meat eater before the class began so it wasn't like they had pre-prepared for meat-eaters only or anything.It was an okay class.

Tom Kha Goong, Tom Yum Goong (Thai and Tourist version), Tom Yum Chili Paste and Prawn Stock. It was sooooo delicious and if you get all the ingredients in your home country, easy to cook.Afterwards my favorite noodle dish, Pad Thai. (Sweet Tamarind Juice is a nice side you can make while using the rest for your Pad Thai) I tried a lot of recipes for Pad Thai already and they all didn't turn out that great. (could have been me though :D ) This recipe and the easiest way to cook it is just awesome....one of the best Pad Thai Goong ever. And I made it?? Amazing....Green Curry Paste and Green Curry Chicken are the last 2 dishes...lucky me, green curry is my favorite curry..excellent. Chef LeeZ showed us how to make the green curry paste and how to alter some ingredients for a red and yellow curry. And again, the taste was soooo good. After all, probably the best spend 1.000BHT ever. Lot of helpful tips to create the perfect Pad Thai and Green Curry, very nice professional chef and you even do something for a good cause!

Chef Lee is so friendly and informative; I learnt huge amounts, not just about how to prepare the food, but about how to choose ingredients. It was a lovely morning and I really appreciated that when my boyfriend arrived early to meet me, Chef Lee invited him in to share the food (although possibly not as much as he appreciated it!). As someone else has said, the only downside is that this opened my eyes to all the things that restaurants do wrong! I've yet to get a tom yum as good as Leez!"

When we arrived at Chef Leez for our private course we were very tired because we had just completed a five hour walking tour in the middle of the day.

We were given drinks and time to cool down before we headed to the markets. We learnt six recipes and they were all fantastic. Chef Leez indinidually looks after everyone and it was the best cooking experience I have ever had in Asia. Next time I am in Bangkok, I can't wait to go back to learn some more."

Chef Lee is a charming person that escorts her customers through the fine art of thai cooking.I did the class with six courses together with three friends and I think the time was very well disposed. We chopped and sliced a few vegetables ourselves and otherwise Chef Lee would show us how she does it. Two other employees makes sure that everything is ready for the cooking stations where the food is actually made, so no time is wasted by having the customers preparing all the ingredients.The icing on the cake was that Chef Lee added two bonus dishes because I and another customer asked about two dishes not on the menu. I did not ask to make it but Chef Lee insisted that we should. Everyone participating in the class therefore got two bonus dishes with no extra cost. It shows the love and passion Chef Lee has for Thai cuisine. Even if you just have a short time in Bangkok I thoroughly recommend Chef Leez cooking school if you enjoy thai food!"

We went for the full day and attended a local market with the chef to begin with. It was a slightly more authentic market than I was used to with only a few stalls selling produce. The chef spoke very good English and explained how to find the best products whether it was dried shrimp of garlic. We cooked six dishes after returning from the market. The room you cook in is air conditioned and well equipped. Everything was ready and waiting for us upon our return. The food really is amazing and you can taste the difference between the food you cook here and the food in many restaurants. Everything is so fresh. The day is really fun and the chef is really knowledgeable with any questions you might want to ask. The only thing I would say is that they are so organised and helpful that it is almost too easy. All of the quantities you need are already prepared for you, but you do get given a recipe booklet with everything you need to know. I have already replicated the Som Tam (Papaya Salad) at home and it is delicious. Thanks for an awesome day."

I liked that she showed us how she picked the right dried shrimps and which vegetables and not the old dark dried chilies etc. I liked that I finally had someone to ask about the market cats and stray(?) dogs (while none particular owns them, people will be nice and provide water and scraps so they keep away rats and lizards).

Chef Leez had no problem in accommodating these and showed us both how to alter each recipe to suit our needs. Her English was great and the team were happy and helpful. The food tasted AMAZING.The structure is simple and straightforward: we started with a visit to the local market, guided by chef leez. She introduced us to her philosophies on food, and showed is how to prudently acquire good clean and chemical free food from a busy Bangkok market. Worth it just for this experience. Here we (rather chef) got extra ingredients needed for our special requests (vegetarian & super spicy).The lesson: for each dish we started with the base ingredient and prep, making coconut cream and milk, tamarind paste, and a chilli paste for the soups, curry paste for the curries. From these basics of Thai food we learnt kinetically how to mix and combine them into pretty much all Thai foods. We made and sampled three soups, four curries, two noodle dishes a salad and desert. Even though the basics were so similar we were surprised at how different the final products were. DO NOT EAT BREAKFAST, you'll be nearly full after the soups, with many more dishes to come, and they are that good that you will want to finish every drop.  We left with the knowledge of how to expand and adapt these basics into many more. Five stars.The cost of 1500 Thai baht is very reasonable. Considering in other (more touristy) places like Koh Samui you can expect to pay between 1500-2000 baht and learn only two dishes, and they're not this good. Getting there: was easier than expected, LTS provided us with very simple and direct instructions in both English and Thai. We managed to get a tuk tuk to the door from our hotel in Chinatown for 100 baht, which we and the driver were happy with.The lesson took four hours and we needed a nap afterward as we were so full. Highly recommended to both advanced and novice cooks."

Since he does ALL the cooking I planned to go along to take pictures. We were told on arrival that only enrolled students could attend, so I was signed up, a little trepidatious about what would be required of me. In the end I had a fantastic time, as Chef Lee herself absorbed my part in a kindly subtle way. So if this sounds familiar to anyone reading this, fear not and do not miss the class. First of all, if for any reason this renown chef should choose to stop teaching her very delicious Thai cuisine, I am certain that she would have great success as a stand-up comedian. Laughter was certainly a spice of the day. We joined an international group of three other couples and set off on a field trip to the nearby market, making a brief stop to wonder at the monitor lizards sunning in the canal along the way. Without our guide we would never have guessed what emerged when we entered a narrow alley. A warren of stalls, each specializing in a product Chef Lee narrated (e.g., how the Taiwanese invented the coconut shredder for the essential Thai ingredient, what ingredient was a good or bad choice, how the cats came to enjoy preferential treatment after a flood that miraculously spared the market they frequented, and many instances of products that would never be sanctioned in a Western culture but are essential to the preparation of authentic Thai cuisine and more). The butcher\u2019s stall was remarkable with production ongoing. Back to the school where an incredibly delicious meal was demonstrated, produced and enjoyed, in part due to the choreography of the staff who enhanced the convivial experience. Our menu of the day included the following: chili paste (hot) on toast, both clear an creamy chicken soup, pad Thai with shrimp, green and massaman curry (a name that evolved from the original Muslim adjective), papaya in a spicy vinegar preparation, polished off with mango and sticky rice. We had a phenomenal meal and a truly memorable day. For a final observation, I was curious about the roll of toilet paper at each station before we began to eat, but it was soon obvious it was there to capture the Thai food tears we all happily shed in the process."

She has very knowledgeable, always giving fun details and answering any questions I had (and I had a lot- about culture, food, etc). The market trip was really cool, you couldn't have this experience on your own. I think people are a bit wary of the quality because the location isn't the nicest- but you pay a bit less for this reason, and the teaching and food quality is probably just as good as a fancy cooking school. Would definitely take this course again- it emphasized good food and helped me to understand thai culture. Chef Leez was very professional. She even added my tip to her charity for street children."

We just walked around while the \u2018guide\u2019 picked out all the produce with little additional information. In the Thai course we were given loads of info on Thai eating habits, quality of the produce, what to look for and more. Very interesting.- Very fresh.

The course catered for all the skill levels present. I produced the most amazing Tom Yum Gung soup. I'll never forget it.Its a wonderful experience that starts in the market where Chef Leez goes through all the do's and dont's of buying whichever produce. Then back to the kitchen to prepare the most amazing food, so fresh and light and tasty.Take your camera. There are lots of opportunities to photograph some great looking dishes (which you made).If you are like me and refuse to use a taxi, be warned. You can get lost as we did. We took the water taxi from Ratchprarop Street to its end. From there its a walk keeping the canal on your left shoulder.Don't keep it on your left shoulder at your own peril.

Chef Leez classes are outstanding!She really wants to teach people about her culture through food and unlike other places who give half recipes she makes sure one is happy.We had a misunderstanding on the dishes we wanted to cook so she made a last minute plan and arrange for extra dishes.One gets to choose what one wants to learn to cook and its not only about the cooking but also going to a local market and understanding the different qualities of ingredients.The biggest proof of how amazing the class is in the food we cooked, each and every single dish was not only amazing but the best thai food we had while in bangkok.After eating here its painful to eat in any restaurant of koh san road. Even if you arent too much into cooking, if you like food go cook so you can eatAlso after being in the class they keep in touch and send you additional recipes and tips"

This one coming from, let me be honest, a non-starter in the kitchen. My wife and I took her course about a week ago. It was delightful - and delicious. She was knowledgeable, enthusiastic and a lot of fun. It starts with a trip to a nearby market, which is interesting in itself. Chef Lee gave us a lot of information about local produce, spices, seafood. Most of it was positive, but she also told us which products weren't quality.Back at the school, we prepared nine dishes (all were the best Thai food we have had in Thailand so far) in four hours. My wife does a lot of cooking and was unsure how much she'd really gain from taking the course, but she was pleasantly surprised that what Chef Leez had to offer went beyond merely following a recipe. An added bonus was that thanks to her recommendation, we now have a full set of quality cooking knives which we purchased in Bangkok. Take the course. You won't regret it!"

Unfortunately, I did not get to experience a Chef Leez Thai cooking school class, but I still had a pleasant experience with this business.I paid in full for a cooking class for 2, but unfortunately after my flights to and from Bangkok were cancelled by the airlines, I had to request a refund. Within a few hours, Chef Leez, issued a FULL refund with no further questions asked. I really appreciate the ease and speed of the refund. Furthermore, I am now seeking many refunds from many different attractions/hotels and it has been a challenge to recover any amount, but this was not so with Chef Leez.If you want to support a business that does it the right way, go to Chef Leez - I'm sure they do a great job with the cooking class as well.

She's a stickler for quality ingredients and showed us what to look for and what not to look for (e.g., tricks vendors use to sell dried shrimp). I used one of her tips the next time I bought a snack from a street vendor (e.g., asked for freshly squeezed pomegranate juice instead of one already bottled - they add sugar to make the juices sweeter). She offers up substitutes for ingredients you may not be able to find in your home location. The class sizes are small enough for the chef to teach either variations or new dishes that are not on the curriculum. She's also supported by staff who help to ensure that you have a clean work space and right ingredients. Chef's English speaking ability is phenomenal. We were joined by a family one day and the kids (teens) really enjoyed the class. I highly recommend the cooking school for anyone. I consider myself a pretty good cook and I was able to learn not only how to make my favorite Thai dishes, but I also learned new cooking tips/tricks. I also compared prices for other cooking schools. The fees are very reasonable and worth what I learned at the school."

The trip to the market was one I could not have experienced without the class. You make everything from scratch, with ingredients bought just before cooking. The dishes are familiar thai foods you can find on every corner of Bangkok (green curry, papaya salad, tom yum soup etc.) but Chef Leez is dedicated to cooking the way \"grandma cooked,\" or rather \"for a 5-Star restaurant not a 2-Star restaurant.\" The result is that the dish you may have had 10 times already tastes amazingly better, fresher, and even more mouthwatering than you could have imagined. And you made it yourself! Chef Leez also gives tips for making your recipes at home without the use of fresh, thai ingredients which you may not be able to get at your local grocery store. Overall, one of the most fun activities in Bangkok."

The beginning of the class starts with a warm introduction to her and Thai cuisine, followed by a trip to an authentic market you will never forget. She goes through every ingredient thoroughly and every ingredient you should avoid using in your cooking. This was extremely informative and showed how much she loves food, cooking, her country and frankly, all of us. Now the cooking. Wow. I have new techniques down and a newfound appreciation for additives that may be complex to make but provide ALL the flavor. You just have to take the time and effort to get those ingredients, do it right, and make Chef LeeZ proud. We made three soups, two curries, papaya salad, and desert. The portions are just right to make it through. She was so sweet to put a candle on our sticky rice with mango to make my husband's birthday memorable.

Chef Lee and the kitchen assistant prepare the quantities and ingredients, so you only need to chop fresh ingredients and cook the food.The experience is like an interactive cooking show!

Then we took a short trip to the market to purchase more ingredients and continued furthering our knowledge.We started cooking after our trip and followed the set of dishes that had been pre-set. Chef Lee kindly added more dishes as we requested such as papaya salad. Although, cooking itself wasn't difficult nor complex, the main thing that I learned was the technique and small details that make Thai cooking unique. Essentially, it was learning the basics on how to make Thai food taste the way it does. I recommend really paying attention to how the dishes are made rather than what is in it.Overall, this has been my best experience that I've had in Thailand during my trip and only wish I had more time to cook and learn.

Besides another couple, it was only my girlfriend and I. After a small introduction the chef and everything she stands for, we went to a small market a few blocks away. It was somewhat hidden and as authentic as you could have. We learnt about the different keystones of our recipes and the difference between quality and the famous MSG, so often used in western kitchens. After that, we made the coconut cream and paste by ourselves and started cooking.The dishes were so good, so pure. The green curry mixed with coriander still lasts in my memory! Small footnote: there is not much cooking in fact, because most of the ingredients are already prepared and cut by the assistants. In most cases you just have to throw your ingredients in the saucepans. But somehow we completed our five dishes and chef Leez\u2019 enthusiasm and professionalism are additive. She surely does know what she\u2019s talking about and with her friendliness she shares every secret the Thai kitchen has to offer.I recommend to do this cooking class before your actual trip starts, because after this lesson you have a better and more accurate view on the dishes in the various food stalls during the rest of your journey. And last but not least, do NOT under any circumstance have breakfast before you arrive!!We kept the recipes and even though some ingredients are hard to find, we still prepare them at home! (In my opinion one of the best souvenirs you can have from Thailand).

I went there for the morning class (10am) with my wife and my mum. We had a beautiful and memorable time, lots of laugh and lots of love. Chef Lee is a Master in Thai cooking, we could see that she loved sharing her knowledge in Thai food and her Culture. I'd like to thanks also the team, the 2 students helping her to make the course smoother. Btw, the little market was magic, a lot of things going on in there. Just enjoy!"

The menu was actually my deciding factor in choosing this cooking school because they were mostly my favorites - tom yum soup, curries, pad thai, sticky rice with mango and papaya salad. Morning well spent. :) I recommended to friends and they'll definitely consider this when they decide to take some cooking class in Bangkok."

We were warmly welcomed, and the class was wonderful. The staff does so much work in the background (preparation, cleaning) that you can focus on learning how to make the dishes. Chef lee provides a lot of insight into what is good and what to avoid when cooking Thai food, and the short trip to the market sets the stage for that. I wish we had more time, we would love to come back for more."

I chose chef Leez' school because of the positive reviews on tripadvisor as well as their willingness and ability to veganize the class for me. We ended up having the best time and this was definitely the highlight of my first bangkok trip. I have done quite a few tourist cooking classes and this was by far the best one. We got to pick our own menu for the class. Among the 4 of us there's 1 vegan, 2.seafood eaters and 1 animal eater. It was definitely tricky. Chef Leez was not only accomedating, she remembered all of our preferences and gave each of us additional recommendations on what we could do at home. The food we made in class was what I would call \"the real deal.\" We made our own coconut cream and our own chili paste. None of that processed stuff you get at restaurants. And that made our food sooo much better. The mango sticky rice we made in class was hands down the best mango sticky rice I have ever had. Now, on to the Chef. Chef Leez is just amazing. She is professional and knowledgable. But she was also extremely humourous and easy going at the same time. We had two people who had never cooked before and there was more than your usual amount of spillage and panicking. She handled it gracefully and with time to throw in a laughter or two. She controlled the flow and the timing of the class perfectly. Even though none of us really knew what we were doing, somehow in the end, we all successfully completed our 5 dishes and all were so full on the best Thai food ever we couldn't walk. I really truly had the most incredible and memorable time during our class with Chef Leez. I sincerely recommened this class to those interested in learning the secrets to making delicious Thai food. I already plan to come back and make 5 diffrent dishes next time I am in Bangkok."

We couldn\u2019t believe the number of dishes we covered in 4 hours, on top of that learning so much about the ingredients and the traditional ways to prepare each dish. We had a private class with 7 people and all walked out feeling like we were experts on Thai food\u2026no quite but an awesome experience nonetheless!Forget all the rest, Chef LeeZ is the best!"

Chef LeeZ cooking school is a simple establishment that delivers the secrets of Thai cuisine directly, and intensively, if you are so inclined, to you over a few hours. I took the beginner's fruit carving class, and was astonished to learn as much as I did. Chef Lee sensed I was very interested and did not let me rest on my laurels! I had so much fun, and was fully absorbed for three hours or so, carving leaves, flowers, even roses (this belongs in the advanced class, normally, but as I said, the pace was picked up - and I loved that! She could have \"taken it easy\" and let me fritter away, so to speak, but she was watching me closely, and decided to challenge me progressively). What a great teacher. If you have any interest in Thai cooking or carving, this is a wonderful person to go to. Just so you know, when I was paying with PayPal, I tried following the website instructions of leaving instructions to merchant on PayPal as to which class I could attend... It wasn't possible, but the school contacted me by email super quickly to sort that out. You can just as well email them yourself and tell them. Based on everything I have experienced, they will make it work."

We were welcomed by her and her helpers before going to the market where she collected all the necessary ingredients for our cooking explaining them as she went along which was a real eye opener. We were shown how popular MSG is in the cooking and how much she detests it, opting more for real ingredients with real flavours and boy can she cook! After the market we went back to cook dishes such as Pad Thai, Thai Green/Red Curry and Tom Yum Paste, Sticky Rice with mango and more! She taught at a comfortable pace and I didnt get bored of saying YUM after trying every dish I cooked! We were both stuffed at the end of the class and eager to get out there to cook our own food. We were also able to recognise many of the ingredients within our food through the rest of our Thailand trip. We both agreed it was the best food we had on our entire trip. Thank you Chef Leez!!"

What an amazing day with Chef Leez - such a lovely, accommodating lady who is very knowledgeable when it comes to food!The class consisted of myself and six other students which gave it a very exclusive feel. I was the only student visiting alone, however never felt excluded or alone.The morning consisted of an explanation of what we would be cooking that day, and allowed us to sample of several varieties of local fruits (Chef Leez even purchased a durian on request which we all sampled for dessert). Chef Leez also asked if we had any requests for recipes which we would like to cook.Next it was off to the market - each ingredient was explained, what to look for when buying, etc. It was interesting to experience a local market first hand although it was very hot and stinky - welcome to Bangkok! I thoroughly enjoyed watching a machine shred fresh coconut which we would later make coconut milk with.On returning to the class room Chef Leez explained and demonstrated how to make fresh coconut milk, tamarind paste, and a few others.It was then time to get down to business - many of the dishes were taught in the following order: Chef Leez makes the dish first with all watching, we all got to sample her cooking than got to cook it for ourselves. After each dish you sit down to enjoy your meal (don't worry, the portions are very small), then on to the next dish. Our class got to learn/make (in English) Tom Yum Chili Paste, Spicy & Sour Prawn Soup, Fried Noodles with Prawns/Pad Thai, Green Curry Paste, Green Curry with Chicken, Pa-Nang Curry with Chicken, Green Papaya Salad, Coconut Sticky Rice with Mango, Shrimp Cakes and Masaman Curry! So, so much variety!I am vegetarian and my needs were accommodated to without hassle. I can not wait to get back to Australia to show off all of my new cooking skills :)The cooking school is quite easy to find and is located along the main road, not down the soi, as I first thought. A taxi from Sukhimvit in peak hour traffic took approximately 60 minutes and cost 200 baht. It took me two attempts in finding a taxi which would take me. I did arrive one hour early though which I was later told if I had of left an hour later than there would have been no traffic!This is a very good valuable experience which you should not pass up while in Bangkok!"

The chef explains the different ingredients and shows you around the market filled with local Thais. You then head back to immaculately clean kitchen where you begin your course and learn to make a variety of dishes (including Pad Thai & Thai Green curry and sticky rice & Mango). It's fair to say this was the best thing we did in Bangkok and we would highly recommend it to family and friends. The chef is all about attention to detail and she is more than happy to answer any questions and be interrupted to explain different alternatives to the ingredients (I.e. Great if the stated ingredients would be hard to find back home). The cost is 1500b and its worth every penny. You leave with a print out of the recipes, fabulous tasting food (which you just cooked) and an enthusiasm to whip out the Wok when your back home and become a Thai masterchef!

You might think that in a group class you don't get attention but you'd be wrong. The Chef paid attention and helped each student in the class. In addition she was able to tailor the recipes for my vegetarian daughter and peanut allergy family. The air conditioning really helped to keep the heat out of the cooking! I'd recommend this fun and tasty class to any Bangkok visitor."

In couple of hours I learned basics of fruit carving and managed to create beautiful flowers and ornaments from cucumber, carrot, pumpkin and papaya. Cooking session was also excellent. Although I'm quite familiar with preparing thai food, I got many good hints and learned a lot about ingredients and techniques. Chef Lee is absolutely fantastic teacher in both carving and cooking. It was really great fun!"

To start with, the chef took us to market and taught us the basic knowledge on major thai dishes ingredients. Then we returned to the classroom and start the cooking class. The chef is a very nice lady and we felt her passion in cooking and sharing knowledge. I cannot imagine i can cook such a great tom yum gung, pad thai and green curry in just 4 hours.

Chef Lee was an outstanding teacher. She not only taught you how to cook, but she shared so much about the local culture - it was a great mix of the two. And she paced the class perfectly - she broke down the recipes into manageable chunks for participants with any level of cooking experience, there was a lot of hands on experience, and plenty of opportunity for questions. What made this class exceptional was Chef Lee's personality - she is adorable - and made everyone feel so welcome. This was a great way to spend a half day in Bangkok."

We will be making our own shrimp oil and Tom Yum paste as soon as we get home!! Lots of tasters, but not so much that we felt full or uncomfortable. Very happy that the kitchen is air conditioned, so no concerns about temperature while cooking at all. Easy to find as we were staying a short distance away and were able to get the bus. Well signposted from the street. One small gripe is that the Chef spends a lot of time telling you that all restaurants use poor ingredients that are bad for your health. If you took everything to heart, you would eat anything else in Thailand out of fear of imminent death. I prefer to be given a few facts about what to look for so I can make my own informed decision."

It was amazing connecting the flavors I was familiar with to the actual plant / root / leaf / fruit it comes from. Have you ever heard of Kaffir Limes? Me neither...Then the Chef told us what to look for when buying the ingredients. Prices, smells, textures, very informative, though I don't think I'll be able to remember it all.She shows you what to do, then you're off doing it yourself. The class was run wonderfully and was so much fun.I only wish there was a short period in the beginning with a chance for the students to meet eachother. It happens anyway, but some formality would be nice.For anyone, solo or not, it's a great experience."

Let me start with the one minor negative. From the CBD of Bangkok it was a time consuming taxi drive. Chef LeeZ does a good job of representing this on her web site. She provide a good map, accurate time estimates and cost. If you're staying by the river her location is much more convenient. It was very clear throughout our 4 hours class that Chef LeeZ loves what she is doing which translates to a wonderful experience for her students. She speaks fine English and is easy to understand and answers questions in great detail. Although I'm a amature cook I've taken many cooking classes and consider myself well versed in the kitchen. This class strikes a nice balance of being shown what to do and then allowing you to repeat the techniques yourself.I was amazed at how good the simple dishes we prepared tasted. Upon finding adequate ingredients at home I have no doubt I could replicate the tastes we created in class. I was extremely fortunate to select a day for class that only had one other student. Essentially we had a private class but I have no doubt even a full class, I believe 8 students, would be just fine.I would not hesitate to return for more classes on my next visit to Thailand.Chef LeeZ keep up the good work.Ted Kalota"

My husband and I undertook Chef Leez class on our last day in Bangkok, we are so glad we did.This was one of the highlights from our trip, Chef Leez spoke good english and the food menu was amazing.We visited a market first up and then back to cook the first dish - Green curry.I must admit, some of the instructions on the receipes differed slightly from the information Chef Leez was saying (i.e. mix sugar, fish sauce and chilli paste together prior to adding- Chef Leez, however the recipe said add everything at the same time). Just make sure you take good notes and update the recipe with any secrets Chef Leez gives.They give you unlimited water while you are there, and as it was an extremely hot day around 40+ degrees this was very much appreciated. I can not speak highly enough of Chef Leez course, she involved all the particpants in the cooking and even pitted the girls against the boys to see who can make a curry better, which was very fun.I am even going to try and make my own shrimp paste later today (one of chef leez extra receipes she gave out).At the end of the class, we were all stuffed to the brim and Chef Leez, knowing how bad taxis can be in Bangkok, came out with all of us and hailed cabs for each group and told them in thai where we were all headed to.Overall, excellent class with an excellent teacher and excellent food."

We arrived here after a long day which started early at the floating market as well as the train market. By the time we got to Chef Leez, we were famished. She quickly fixed us up some sticky rice and mango - which was AMAZING. We got to make so many different types of noodles and curries, and she even made some special mango chicken for us. Finally we ended the class with another order of sticky rice and mango. The course was really great, and showed us that when you have the proper ingredients, cooking Thai food is not too difficult. Everything we made ourselves came out wonderful. Going to buy the ingredients from the traditional Thai market was a great experience; it really allowed up to see into the daily life of the Thai. This was one of our favorite activities we did while in Thailand. Thanks Chef Lee!!PS - to this day, we still havent found any sticky rice and mango that compares to hers!"

We went on a tour of a local market which was both interesting and informative, although the instruction is where the class really shines. We made probably 5 different dishes in class, all of which were outstanding, and really learned how integration of different ingredients altered the flavor and consistency and base dishes (e.g., curry). There are a lot of cooking stations in the class (>= 5) so unlike some other classes I have been to much of the class can cook simultaneously. Chef Lee does a great job monitoring everyone and making sure your dishes come out wonderfully. The class isn't cheap but it's worth every baht."

Lee was very knowledgable, friendly, and had a great sense of humor. Our market visit that day was to a local market which gave us a glimpse into real life in Thailand. We learned to recognize a variety of unfamiliar Thai ingredients. Since Chef LeeZ dosen't provide transport, it took some research to find the best way to get there. Our hotel was near the river ferry so we took the orange ferry to Pier 13. From there it was a rather short and uncomplicated walk to Chef LeeZ. Given the traffic in Bangkok, I think it was more reliable than a taxi to get there on time."

Everything was simple and fresh and delicious. We could choose the level of spiciness and enjoyed every bowl of food that we made. Its not too easy to find all the ingredients at home but even if we manage something close to what we cooked there it will be tasty and different.

            "review": "Chef LeeZ and Helping Hands Comparison. I attended two cooking classes in Bangkok (Helping Hands with Poo, and Chef LeeZ) and so will write a single review that discusses both. I will then rate each class separately under their respective headings. I found Helping Hands particularly insightful because of the location, the (so-called) Klong Toey slum, and also because it combined a visit to Bangkok's largest wet market to purchase fresh ingredients for the class. Many, myself included, are sure to find elements of the market disturbing. There will be areas you'll need to hurry through if you don't want to see live animals, including turtles and frogs, slaughtered. That said it is possible to avoid the more grisly sights, and the market is unquestionably a hyper-sensory experience; a vast array of colors, smells and just about every ingredient imagineable is available there somewhere. And the idea of the slum location shouldn't be off-putting; it was fascinating to walk along the narrow pathways, and to see first-hand how the majority of Bangkok's citizens live on a daily basis. The area was both safe and clean, and the class room on a par with Chef LeeZ's. In terms of the class itself, I would say Chef Lee might have been a slightly more thorough teacher than Poo. Her instruction was more detailed, and various aspects of the preparation and cooking process explained in greater depth. If you are in Bangkok long enough, or have the time and resources to attend more than one class, I highly recommend both. If your interest is soley on learning how to prepare classic thai dishes, Chef LeeZ may be the better option. If you want to combine an educational experience with basic thai cooking instruction, Helping Hands and Poo might hold more interest. The story, and history of Helping Hands is also gratifying, and something that Poo shares during the course of the class. I should also point out that Chef LeeZ also features a brief visit to a small local market. The recommended instructions for getting to Chef Lee are by boat, so if you don't have a separate river excursion planned, this also adds to the experience. The boat isn't necessary however, and we actually took a taxi back to our Ratchaprasong area hotel (much quicker than the boat option). I thoroughly enjoyed, and highly recommend both classes."

She is passionate, patient, joyful and one of a kind. She inspired me!We took 2 classes- Cooking Class and Fruit & Vegetable Carving Class so were there from 9am until 7pm. Needless to say we got to spend lots of quality time with Chef Leez and her sisters/staff.Cooking School- As a chef and foodie the class was an awesome intro into Thai cooking. We began by taking a trip to the food market and sourcing all of our fresh ingredients. Chef Leez is a stickler for fresh and quality ingredients with absolutley no shortcuts. The lessons were substantial and she made it easy for people of all levels and skill sets. She event went off the menu to include Lard Na- A dish i requested.The Food- was amazing. Fresh, vibrant, flavorful. Like a party in your mouth each time. After each dish preparation we all sat down family style to eat and enjoy. In between courses she personally took us through the neighborhood to shop for souveniers and goodies. She didnt have to that and Im sure that was her break/lunch time but she patiently took us around and negotiated with vendors for us. She also pointed out what to look for in street vendors as we were concerned with safety- clean oils, cleanliness, ingredients, etc. So helpful.Fortunately for us we were the only 2 people in the carving class. It was as if we were in her living room as she taught us the tricks of the trade. Again, patient, creative and passionate. I ended up with a gallery style presentation that looked like a garden of ornately carved fruits and vegetables.I will return to Bangkok and to Chef Leez class just to be in her presence and feel her energy. I took cooking classes in Vietnam which cannot even compare to Chef Leez. She puts her heart and soul into her passion of cooking and instructing and I am so grateful I was able to spend a day with her.Highly recommended on your Things To Do List in Bangkok!Give her a hug for me!"

She also showed as what is the difference between the cheap and the expensive products and how they differ in taste. Everything was well organized and she explained all the dishes very well. What I liked about this course was that we got to make 10 different dishes and taste little bits of all. I prefer variety in smaller portions rather than just cooking one big meal and eating it. She also has a fund for under privileged children which I think is great. Overall she was super friendly helpful and a great teacher with wonderful handy tips."

Don't be fooled by the unassuming storefront set up, there is some real food going on in here. The market tour teaches both what to look for and what to avoid when shopping in Bangkok's fresh food markets.We were lucky enough to have a day with a small group but Chef Leez personality shines with a group of 6 or 14. She will keep you entertained whether you are a professional chef or a novice in the kitchen. In a typical 4 hour class you learn several soups, curries, pad thai and sticky rice mango, plus several variations on each dish. If you have any interest in learning real Thai staples done the right way visit Chef Leez."

However, there is not a lot of cooking involved if that is what you are looking for. All the different ingredients are prepared for you - all you actually do is mix them togehter. Chef LeeZ is great! Positive, smiling and explains well. Her husband (?) is also there and his job seems to be to promote the class and make sure we recommended it to others. We found this to be a bit disruptive.

I am a foodie and have taken quite a few cooking classes in the US, and wanted to choose the correct one while in Bangkok. I can honestly state that Chef Lee exceeded my expectations, beginning when she met our cab, as our driver was unsure where the school was located (even though we had downloaded the directions on the site- our driver actually called her while in transit). We began by going to a local market around the corner, where she shopped for the ingredients we needed for our class. Every student has their own wok, and her instruction is easy to follow. The sanitation is first rate, from washing of hands to refrigerated ingredients. We made 9 dishes in total, each in small portions so we could eat all that we created. At the end of the class, my sister and I wanted to buy some packaged curry pastes at the local market. Chef Lee took us their personally and then walked us to the location where we could catch the river taxi to the metro. The chef is very organized, knowledgeable and patient with her students. She rightfully deserves all the accolades she receives, so enroll now!"

Chef Lee is a warm, friendly, and engaging professional who has grown up cooking Thai food, and instantly makes you feel comfortable with the Thai cooking basics. We started with a short walk to the local market to learn more about and purchase fresh ingredients--and I mean LOCAL MARKET that gives one a true feel for old Bangkok. Once back at the cooking school (a relatively small space, but adequate for our needs), we launched right into understanding how these various ingredients fit into the many courses we prepared. Each participant had their own prep and cooking area, so everyone got the full experience of making delicious Thai food. In our class there was a total of 6 people, and we prepared (and ate!) 9 fabulous dishes. Chef Lee was exceptionally organized, explained the basics well, and led us through the entire cooking process from start to finish. We ate each dish as we progressed, so by the time we completed the 4+ hour course, we were wonderfully full from the many delicious Thai dishes. Overall, it was a really fun way to spend several hours in Bangkok, let alone an educational experience I won't forget."

The menu is well designed to teach the basics of cooking and the food tastes great.

It was relaxed, it was fun, and I learned a lot. Chef Lee speaks excellent English, is a good teacher, and is entertaining and personable. I was surprised at how simple it was to cook great-tasting Thai dishes - Chef Lee's Pad Thai is simply the best I've ever had. And she emphasizes the health aspects of good home cooking - fresh ingredients, lower sodium content than curry pastes from a jar, and weight control. We got a lot done in a short time (about 4 1/2 hours), including a trip to the local market, but I never felt rushed - very good time management. Plus, you also get some home support - she has how-to videos on her website in case you need a refresher. BTW, I have a Apple computer accessing the internet on Safari, and not all of Chef LeeZ website is compatible with this set-up. If your home computer is set up like mine, you may also have some difficulty with some pages of the website. One caveat: My photo is in the Trip Advisor photos for Chef LeeZ provided by the management. I didn't even realize I was being photographed, and was quite surprised to see myself in the photos. If you don't want this to happen to you, you should probably mention it when you sign up. I'm sure they'd honor the request if you asked not to be photographed, I just didn't think to do it. Bottom line: Chef LeeZ has my whole-hearted recommendation."

My dad isn't a fan of spicy food, so chef lee tailored his dishes accordingly.

She took me to a lovely little market a short stroll away and explained some of the local delicacies and bought the ingredients for the recipes. I made 3 soups, 2 curries plus a pad thai, a papaya salad and the gloriously delectable mango and sticky rice. I got to taste everything while it was hot but could not finish everything as there was so much food. I had never had thai food that tasted so good. I took all the food I cooked back to my hotel room in beautifully packed containers which was readily scoffed by my husband who is still raving about the flavours.

Chef Lee was clearly a regular, interacting with the shopkeeps as she expertly chose a variety of fresh ingredients for our lesson.Once we got back to the studio, the fun really began. We took a stab at cutting our own vegetables for a round of delicious soups: spicy prawn soups and a coconut milk chicken soup, which may have won the day!Next, we tackled the classic pad Thai. Our wok became our palette as we mixed and mingled the mouthwatering flavors of the Indochine. We followed our pad thai with a duo of curries. For the green, we slaved away with mortal and pestle to concoct a fresh green curry paste.There was no rest for our weary tastebuds as papaya salad spiced up the afternoon. Chef Lee whipped up some delicious Thai iced tea, which was definitely needed to counteract the punch-packing salad.Finally, it was time for dessert. We thoroughly enjoyed the sticky rice with mango, which was perfectly topped with coconut cream.Overall, the food was terrific and some of the best we had in Southeast Asia. But what was better was the personal interest, dedication, and passion with which Chef Lee conducted class. Even though we are certainly not classically trained chefs, Chef Lee refused to cut corners and encouraged us to truly and honestly engage with Thai cuisine. The class was very hands-on and fun- we really recommend paying a visit to Chef Lee during your stay in Bangkok.P.S. her school, like all buildings in BKK, may prove difficult to locate. Ask your hotel to call her first and have the hotel staff explain the location to a taxi driver. Do not get into Tuk-tuks! No MSG :)"

Super fun - worth every penny!So we started by going shopping in an open air market to get all our ingredients nice and fresh.We haul it all back to the school/kitchen and get started. The rest of the afternoon was prep a dish, cook, eat, prep another dish, cook, eat, prep, cook, eat... you get the idea. The recipes were so tasty, very authentic, no cheating (no MSG) and after we could eat no more, we took home the recipe books for free and can now confidently treat our friends to authentic Thai food at home.I can't say enough about having a true Master Thai Chef leading you through this process. Chef Lee, Thank you for a wonderful day!Enjoy - StreetGrinder"

We are impressed with the taste of our own cooking especially the Pad Thai & Green Curry. One thing for sure.. looking at recipe is just not enough to a yummy dish. The 'secret' technique play a big part which we need to hands-on with eyes / nose / mouth wide open. I can't wait to try it this weekend.Love the taste and the experience too. Thanks Chef!!"

Chef Lee and the team were really friendly and inviting and Chef Lee herself has an infectious laugh and a great sense of humour. The tour to the market was a really nice way to start and the produce was all very fresh, which is always nice to see. Chef Lee gave great tips and easy to follow instructions for all the recipes. It was also nice and hands on so we really got a feel for using the wok and making everything of scratch. We made lots of dishes and everything was delicious. The recipes are easy to follow and I will definitely make them at home. All in all it was a really great day and we got to eat all of the most popular Thai dishes. I also like that you get access to a whole list of other recipes on the website. If they are anything like the ones we made then they will be delicious. The class was really great value for money!!! Highly recommended :)"

Chef Lee is an excellent teacher with a great sense of humor and will always explain the \"whys\" in each step of the process. We chose this school for it's great reviews and extensive menu that is learned, and it was well worth it. My husband and I paid for a private class with Chef Lee including the market tour, which was as informative and exciting as the actual cooking. Chef Lee has great skill, but is easily able to break down the steps so that anyone can learn. She also added in a few extra menu items, the yellow curry crab - to die for - and the fried bananas, on top of everything else. We were well-informed and well-stuffed by then end of the class. It was very important to us to have a school that does more than simply give you ingredients to mix together...we wanted to actually learn about the ingredients, how they go together, and the traditional methods for building a Thai meal. We were extremely pleased with the Ma-Sa-Man school and would recommend it wholeheartedly to friends and family!"

We cooked many dishes and at each stage she explained why she used certain ingredients and also gave tips along the way for healthy eating.

            "review": "Outstanding Culinary Experience!. Ma-Sa-Man Thai Cooking School set the standard for my new goal of learning to cook ethnic dishes in every new country I visit. After reading the positive reviews on Tripadvisor, I tried to make a reservation for Christmas Day and they were kind enough to offer the course for just me and a new friend I met on the plane. Imagine that your warm and funny aunt or grandmother was teaching you to cook at home, and now you know what it's like to be taught by Chef Lee. From a list of common Thai dishes, we created a 5 course lunch menu of Tom Kha Gai (Coconut Milk/Galangal Soup w/Chicken), Som Tom Ma La O (Green Papaya Salad), Pad Thai, Nam Phrik Gang Pa-Nang (Red Coconut Curry Paste) to use in Pa-Nang Gai (Red Coconut Curry Chicken), and Kow Neeow Ma-Muang (Mango Sticky Rice).Chef Lee first took us a few blocks away to get fresh ingredients from a market and she noted the importance of buying natural and organic food without any pre-made additives, MSG, or preservatives. Back in the kitchen, she demonstrated each step to prepare each dish, and then we made our own individual dishes with her guidance. Everything was made from scratch - from extracting coconut cream and coconut milk by soaking freshly grated coconut in warm water and squeezing by hand, to making red chili paste with a mortar and pestle.While other courses may offer fancier facilities or try to teach more dishes in the same amount of time, Ma-Sa-Man Thai Cooking School offers real Thai hospitality with a focus on quality ingredients and detailed instruction. The value can't be beat either, for the price of a dinner in a fancy Bangkok restaurant, you spend 4-5 hours learning how to make the same food with your own hands and enjoy the meal at the end of class!"

You can learn lots as an amateur cook.4 of us attended a morning (10-2) cooking session here. It started off sampling Thai tropical fruits and being taught what to look for, feel for and taste to know you've got good produce. Next we visited the local market in some back alley warehouse type of place, learning more about the food we were about to cook with. Then it was back for mise en place, and cooking in pairs.Within each pair you cook generally with the same base ingredients, but making slight alterations to end up with totally different dishes to share with your partner. Throughout the whole process the chef is more than helpful in providing advice on what you are doing, when to add ingredients and why. We went away feeling like we understood much more about Thai cuisine and confident in cooking it in the future. The only issue was that the recipes were sometimes way different to what we actually did, so follow the website recipes with a grain of salt (pun intended)."

Having been to Bangkok a dozen times since it's so near to Singapore, i decided to do something differently for this trip and that's to attend a cooking class with my fiance. Having read the rave reviews for Ma-Sa-Man, i decided to register and pay deposit (so that we will not have any last min change of plans, eg shopping hahaa). We are lucky enough to get a taxi driver who fetch us from Holiday Inn Express Siam right to the sch door step in 15 minutes and 75baht fare. Just rem to print the map with thai address =)To cut the story short, being a first-timer taking cooking lessons, we were totally at ease and have no problems preparing the food. It tastes really good as well. They were generous with their ingredients (juicy prawns ''overdose'' but it was yummy) and Chef Lee is really accomodating by changing the papaya salad after I told her that my partner doesnt take papaya..All in all, it was a good session and we felt the time was well-spent despite being in BKK for a mere 1.5 days! Most importantly, my fiance who has never ever cooks or enters the kitchen commented that he thoroughly enjoy the session :) Just a suggestion, we might be keen to go for more cooking classes with Chef Lee on future visits and it will be great to have a little discount for returning visitors like us. Keep it up team!"

On the day of the class, she was waiting for me outside the cooking school so i wouldn't get lost. She started the class by explaining what dishes we would be learning. After a quick trip to the market, she walked us through each dish, emphasizing traditional thai cooking methods, ingredients, etc . . . LOTS of food to try after you've prepared them, so come hungry! All the food was delicious. I have zero experience cooking, so Chef Lee pretty much walked me through all the preparations, but they all turned out perfectly. That's saying quite a lot coming from me! Chef Lee clearly has the expertise to engage all levels of cooking experience. After the class, she waited with me for a bit for my ride to show up.

This was by far the most amazing thai food I ever experience while in Thailand.We cooked Pad Thai with prawns to start, Pa nang curry with chicken and Sticky rice with mango for dessert. Chef Lee was very welcoming and funny, her english was really good and she made the whole experience enjoyable and easy! We started with a bit of an introduction, everything was laid out in quantities so we had to chop and cut most of the things which was fun. We then took it in turns (we had quite a big group) in cooking as there were only 6 woks which was still fun because you got to watch people do it and then have a go yourself! We then got to eat each meal we made which was amazing, i would recommend not eating breakfast as it makes the food much more enjoyable when your starving!The absolute highlight was trying and making my first sticky rice and mango. I never thought i'd be a fan of sticky rice, but it was absolutely amazing, and we even got seconds! Then once we were absolutely stuffed and had eaten everything we got given the recipes so that we could make it all at home. If your worried about it being spicy they are so accommodating, there are chillies that you can put in if you want and you can put as much curry paste in as you want. If i visit Bangkok again i will DEFINITELY be returning to this amazing place!"

The alternatives were too expensive at the Oriental and the Blue Elephant for my budget. I am not organized with my actgivities while travelling. I called May Kaidee's and Ma-Sa-Man Thai Cooking School which were more on my budget, both were very helpful on the phone and had availability for the next day. I booked for the afternoon class first at May Kaidee's and the next day at Ma-Sa-Man. Very surprised to find out that they were both next to each other, very close to Khao San Road area. On both occasions I was THE ONLY ONE, in short I had two private lessons.May Kaidee's was vegetarian and I was a little bit dissapointed at first because I am not vegetarian. Nevertheless I found that the food was very tasty.The menus were similar which I did not mind and was able to compare:At May Kaidee's: It is a small restaurant with the kitchen at the back. No air condition in the kitchen and hot as usual in BKK nevertheless I did not mind it because it was in the open. The menu: Tom Yam Soup, Tom Kha Soup, Isaan, Friend Vegetables with Giinger and Cashew Nuts, Pad Thai, Peanut Sauce, Massaman Curry, Green Thai Curry, Pumpkin Humus, Green Papaya Salad. Food very tastie, staff very friendly, very informal, had a good time, enjoyed my class.Ma-Sa-Man: Air condititoned kitchen and everything closed, obviously, which made me feel a little bit stuffed. Menu was: Tom Yum Gung Soup, Pad Thai, Green Curry Paste, Green Curry with Chicken, Curry with Beef, Green Papaya Salad and Sticky Rice with Mango. Chef Lee was very friendly and informative. Went to a small market next to the school which was very interesting.Cleaningness was similar in both schools, menus were similar, prices were similar. I felt more confortable and preferred the food at May Kaidees."

She shared her knowledge on things outside of the food domain e.g. how to use fruits the treat hair loss :) and if you ask any questions on other dishes, she does not hesitate to demonstrate these extra dishes!I highly recommend learning to cook from Chef Lee!!However the trip to the market is definitely overhyped. Was in a class with some Australian guy who couldn't stop raving about how \"beautiful\" the market was, how \"beautiful\" the smells were, how \"beautiful\" the vegetables were..It's really no different from a farmer's market, except it's in a dark and dingy place. Perhaps as an Asian who has seen wet markets in brighter and cleaner settings, the concept of the \"market\" was not new to me and especially since I've seen that you can enjoy the wonders of a fresh market where there is plenty of light and without spiderwebs hanging over you and mosquitoes buzzing around your legs."

Chef Lee does a great job of engaging students and teaching not just recipes, but small techniques that make a big difference, too! It's very hands on which I enjoyed, you prep most ingredients yourself, watch Chef Lee cook a dish and then do your own. Everything we made was delicious and we left with printed recipes which are so available online.I definitely recommend this course!"

This was my first trip to Bangkok and that too alone, so I had to try something different. Signed-up for Ma-sa-ma's cooking class in April (this was during Songkran and I am so glad they were functioning, unlike pretty much everything in Bangkok which is closed for those Festive days).I was staying at Soi Langsuan and needed directions to the school, which they explained very well over the phone and I could guide the Taxi Driver to the school by myself. Reached and was glad to see that the setting was soo welcoming and warm. We were all given recipes of the amazing dishes we were gonna cook. After a short introduction to Thai cuisine, Chef Lee took us to the local market (a 3 min walk) to buy fresh ingredients that we were gonna cook with. Me being a Food Enthusiast and who loves to cook and experiment with almost anything and everything, the market was a great place to start. Chef Lee is a FUN person to cook with. Not only does she have the expertise but also the ability to make your experience fun!!!!We bought (technically Chef Lee did all the buying and bargaining; we were the apprentices..hahaa) all that we needed and carried them back to the class in very cute little cane baskets. Ingredients were laid out so well for every dish. It was a complete hands-on experience; we did our own cutting, chopping, slicing, dicing, grating, frying, sauteing, boiling, stirring, etc. Chef Lee would demonstrate and we would follow. After we made every dish, we would sit down and eat it!!! That was my favorite part. Everything we cooked was FANTASTIC!!! TASTED GREAT!!! If you are taking the afternoon batch (like I did), would suggest having only a light breakfast before coming to the class, because you will not stop eating what you cooked. The recipes are simply perfect and what we made was the best Thai Food I have ever eaten.Came back home and tried the dishes and they were absolutely SUPERB!!!!! I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who loves food and who loves to cook. Also a must-do for anyone looking for a different experience !!! Visiting a place and doing the regular \"touristy\" things are a cliche for me now and I always am looking for something that will leave a lasting experience. This is definitely one of them !! Thanks Chef Lee and the Team ! I will come back for an advanced class on my next trip to Bangkok !!! Soon !!!"

The menu is fantastic and SO much food, you need a lie down after. Not sure we needed 3 soups, but the pad thai, green curry and the sticky rice and mango were amazing. The small quantities makes it easier so you replicate it at home. We even asked Lee about our favorite Thai dish back home and she made it for us! We recommend to anyone wanting an enjoyable food experience in Bangkok."

Lee is very friendly, open for individual needslike pictures motives and she speaks, of course, a very good and understandable English.

She introduced us to lots of exotic foodstuffs that we don't normally see in the UK and we both had an excellent time at the class.If you are even vaguely interested in cookery then I would highly recommend this class as it was definitely one of the highlights of our trip!

We made 9 dishes within 3.5 hrs including a trip to a near by Market to get ingredients. I love cooking but for some reason, my Thai cooking skill isn't that great. I asked many questions to Chef Lee from the ingredients to cooing methods. On the other hand, my husband who loves Thai food, does not cook at all. (only grilling, you know how American guys are.) But he loved this cooking class and says his highlight of trip was this cooking class (!). I mean we did a lot of activities including Phi Phi Island trip, trip to Krabi, Elephant ride, Cubbing tiger, Tailoring, Renting a moped, etc. But this is something that it will last for the rest of your life!If we ever to go back to Bangkok again, we would love to take another class and learn other dishes!Thank you very much, Chef Lee!"

Not a touristy assemble-the-ingredients-and-stir \"cooking\" class. I definitely got was I was looking for. We chopped, sliced, diced, mashed, stirred, tasted, seasoned, etc. We each had our own cooking station. Chef Lee was amazing!!! She really knows her stuff. I used to think I didn't like Pad Thai. The recipe she taught us was phenomenal as was everything else, especially the sticky rice. Definitely come hungry. We made five dishes. All were fantastic. Everything completely from scratch. We made Papaya Salad, Pad Thai, Green Curry, Red Curry, and Sticky Rice. The best thing about Chef Lee was her passion for food and teaching. Someone in my class asked her about the difference between coconut water and coconut milk. She stopped what she was doing and demonstrated it. When someone asked how to cut the papaya (this was pre-cut), she demonstrated. This was definitely something to leave to an expert. She loved teaching us the intricate subtle techniques that made the food taste better. This was hands down the best meal I had in Thailand.I can't say enough great things. Chef Lee was fun, funny, witty, professional, and completely adorable. I also took her fruit carving class. If you have sculpting experience or enjoy carving pumpkins, this class is another must.One other point, I had gotten prickly heat on my feet and was unable to go to the market. The feedback from others was that it was a worthwhile experience as well.You can stop researching Thai cooking classes and sign up today! You will not be disappointed. It was worth every penny."

It was so enjoyable and value-for-money that we made ad-hoc changes to our itinerary and took another class on the day before our departure. Between the first and second classes, we joined a cooking class of another school in Pattaya, thinking that they were all the same. You know what, there could be a world of difference. And now I have to tell you this: Ma-Sa-Man is definitely the best !!!!! Believe me, it is worth every cent you pay and every minute you spend.I still miss the experience back then. I and my 10-year-old daughter learnt a great deal from Chef Lee, a funny, experienced and professional cook. Her two big boys, Justin and Murray (hope that I spell your names right), were very entertaining and helpful. Chef Lee\u2019s presentation was clear, effective, organised and amusing. The sharing among classmates of different nationalities while we enjoyed scrumptious dishes of our own added to the cosiness of the class. The recipes were well written, containing a lot of useful tips that help us reproduce the same delicacies at home.Do include a visit to this fabulous school in your next visit to Bangkok. You will regret it if you don\u2019t.[P.S. The kind Chef Lee helped us hail a taxi after the class and made the driver promise to charge by the meter. But right after we got into the cab, he said sternly to us, \u201c200 bahts to the hotel\u201d, a charge way higher than the meter fare. With due respect to all the nice and friendly Thai people, we have to say that most of your taxi drivers are robbers!]"

We went to the school for a lunchtime course, which started, after a quick and clear introduction, with a group shopping trip to a local market.

Then back for each dish to be prepared by us after a demonstration and for us to cook - under careful guidance. Everything was clearly explained and help was freely available when needed. The old addage that good cooking involves quality ingredients, cooked simply could not have been better made. The results from taking some care and combining basic ingredients were stunning. The atmosphere was light-hearted and fun! All in all this was a real highlight during our time in Bangkok. Upon our return to the UK we have tried out various of the recipes (substituting local produce where exotic stuff is unobtainable, or too expensive) and the results have been unfailingly good. We can recommend this highly and hope you do too."

We then had a trip to the market where she talked through the ingredients available in Thai cooking and what they were used for as well as what to look out for. The actual cooking lesson was set out so well. Chef Lee would run through how to prepare the dish, you would prep the ingredients, then she would demonstrate from beginning to end. After this she would then recap step by step as you made it. Totally fool proof Thai cooking! Every dish was amazing and we left very full and very happy. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a Thai cooking course with a friendly atmosphere and lots of laughter.

My girlfriend and I had lots of fun in cooking and tasting and it was a comfortable and worthwhile experience.It definitely helps that the Chef Lee is interactive and speaks fluent English and the lesson was very engaging.

We learned how to make eight traditional Thai dishes from steamed curry to papaya salad to mango sticky rice. The day started with a trip to the market with Chef Lee. The class room space was cozy and the staff were extremely friendly. What made the class a blast was Chef Lees great sense of humor. She has a passion for cooking and helping others master the art of Thai cooking. I would highly recommend spending half a day at the Ma-Sa-Man Thai Cooking School during your stay in BKK."

We took the orange river line to Phra Athit and the school is about a 10 minute walk from the ferry terminal. The class is intimate- there were 7 people including us, and each of us had a work station. First we went to the local market and Chef Lee showed us the various Thai produce and ingredients that we were going to use for class. After heading back to the school, we started our cooking lessons. The structure of the class is as follows: Chef Lee would explain the dish, the steps, and we would prep, cook, and eat the dish immediately. Then it was on to the next dish. Chef Lee also had three helpers who would help set up (provide the plates/utensils and prepare our workstations/tables). We ate so much that we had to skip dinner that night! Chef Lee is professional and personable. Her detailed explanations really helped us grasp the basics of Thai cuisine and we're definitely going to try the dishes at home (albeit we may not find the same fresh ingredients here in the States). I highly recommend this class!"

Chef Lee gave me personal attention in the kitchen for over 100 hours, and helped me to really understand Thai cooking. She welcomed me as family by the end of my time there, and I felt I learned invaluable cooking techniques from her. I never felt swindled or uncomfortable, and they worked with my schedule to allow me so many hours in the kitchen. Besides all the great learning I did in the kitchen, the best part, as it should be, was the eating! Trust me, I ate all the street food, and everything I could in Thailand, but nothing beats Chef Lee's cooking. On another note, I now work in the fine dining industry, and use thai techniques for my job every chance I can! Chef Lee will inspire you!"

It really shows from the minute you step through their door. We were 30 minutes early and expected to hang around, Chef Lee had other ideas! We were examining the posters of all the South East Asian fruits and vegetables whilst we waited when Chef Lee descended on us with gusto, showing us extra info from her books and giving us interesting facts from her experience, she is very knowledge indeed. The day was a whirlwind of cooking and excellent information, and since arriving back from our travels, we have already cooked Thai twice!We were supposed to finish at 2pm, but she did 7 courses with us that day and we finished at 4pm. We loved every dish and my partner and I really enjoyed ourselves that day. All our other cooking courses in other countries paled in comparison to this one.We wish Kruzon and Chef Lee every success and all the very best, they undoubtedly deserve to be #1 on TripAdvisor!Top tip: Just get a taxi and don't have breakfast :)"

Not only is she an amazing chef she also has a great personality and makes the class fun. After we were done we wanted to go back. It was nice to go to the food market and have her explain every ingredient and even some that we didn't use. I cook a lot and never realized how simple these Thai dishes could be to prepare. We cooked some of my favorites like Panang Curry and Tom Kaa Gai which Chef Lee says is her Grandmother's recipe. She was so friendly and I highly recommend you take time out of your trip to have this be a stop. There was a nice man there who will take your pictures while you cook too which we found helpful to catch the full experience. We stayed in Sukhumvit area near Asok station. I believe the least expensive way to get there with the best time was to take the Metro(Subway 26 baht per person) to the train station Hua Lampong then catch a taxi from there( 61 baht) Since there were 2 of us we split the taxi cost. We could have taken the Skytrain but that would have been 40 baht with a transfer the 18 baht per person to ride to the last river stop then walk. A long time for the same amount of money. We went home the same way. Don't take the Tuk-Tuk anywhere if you can help it. They are a rip off. And always have the address written in Thai language for the taxi driver to read. Print it out at home before your trip. And stop by Chef Lee for first class education in Thai recipes and ingredients."

My husband, who is not a cook, thoroughly enjoyed the lesson and was pleased that the food he cooked was very edible. All the people at Ma Sa Man Thai were friendly and polite. Came away with recipes and ideas for dinner parties. We took a taxi to the venue and then a taxi back, which Chef Lee helped us to flag down.

I had no prior cooking experience or taken other classes whatsoever and Chef Lee made it real simple. Good activity to do even if you are traveling solo and are interested in cooking. Not too mention, this is very affordable(at 1100 Bhat online booking) and the actual class lasts quite a while. Definitely go with an empty stomach because you will trying a lot of different dishes and will not go home hungry.The cooking school facilities are very easy to reach by taxi from the Sukhumvit area and should cost a little over 70 bhat. I had the hotel explain to the taxi driver the location and they phoned up the school for precise directions. Once you leave the school, Chef Lee will help you track down a taxi to return to the hotel. I can't wait to try the recipes!"

My fiance and I were very excited to find Thai Cooking School BKK on our searches on TripAdvisor, and the reviews did not disappoint.Our class was small (only 6) so we got to decide on our own unique menu between the 6 of us in the class. We went to the market and had a chance to ask Chef Lee about all the things that we had been wondering about during the rest of our trip. The market trip was short, but it was nice to see where our products were coming from and ask any questions.We returned to the classroom on Samsen and began cooking. We made our own coconut cream and milk and then began cooking. Chef Lee was very informative and even amped up the spice for us, as we LOVE spicy food. Chef Lee was able to walk us through 7 dishes during our class and we took notes on the printed recipes that were given when we got back from the market. Some of the instructions differed from the recipes given, as they try to give you recipes that you can create in your own home with things you can find outside of Thailand. After so many dishes, we were stuffed and very happy to finally have some real, authentic Thai cooking experience under our belts.Thanks for the great class and the fabulous recipes. We'll be trying them out on friends over the next few months! The class was one of our trip highlights and we'd recommend it to anyone that loves to cook (and eat) as much as we do!The price for this class is also VERY fair! Many other schools in the area/Bangkok are much more. Thai Cooking School BKK is a very reasonable without skimping on ANY details. Truly one of my favorite experiences from our trip!"

I have been a teacher for twenty years and was extremely impressed with chef Lee's passion for cooking, her knowledge of the history behind each dish, and her ability to keep me engaged for the whole, four-hour class. There were about nine of us in the class and she was able to move about the kitchen and spend equal time with each student. The class was organized and fun, so much that I have reserved a private baking class with Chef Lee tomorrow. I highly recommend Ma-Sa-Man Thai Cooking School BKK."

If you want to eat authentic Thai food and have the opportunity to cook it also, then this is the way to do it. The class lasts approimately 4 1/2 hours and includes a visit to a local market to buy the ingredients. One tip: make sure you do NOT eat a large breakfast before coming to this class. I did and was stuffed afterward. Special mention to Chef Lee who did a great job of holding the class's interest. Highly recommended if you have time while in Bangkok."

She showed us a variety of cooking and preparation techniques which are very important and valuable in the whole cooking experience. For example she showed what to do and what not to do in order to make sure we get the most aroma and flavor from the fresh ingredients. Most of the ingredients are prepared from scratch instead of using a prepared sauce or secret ingredient. At the end of the 3 hr class, we've learned to cook Phat Thai, Chicken Kra Pao (basil chicken), Som Tam (papaya salad), Yum Neua (beef salad) and Tom Kha Gai (chicken coconut soup), all freshly peprared by each student. We ate the dish after we cooked it, and when we're done we're all so stuffed that we need a long walk to burn it off, but we were very happy and satisfied. We paid 3300 baht for 3 students private class, and a fourth person can attend for free."

She teaches you to prepare all of the herbs & spices and then how to assimilate the dish during cooking. The class size is small (there were 10 in our class) so she is back & forth making sure you are doing things properly. After preparing each dish, then you eat it before moving on to the next one. Each dish was great! I'm not huge fan of curry but both were good & my husband declares the Panang the best he has ever had!Chef Lee was also willing to answer any questions about Thai cooking in general & about some of the ingredients that most Americans may neer have seen before.Totally worth the money. In the US you would pay more for all of these dishes in a restaurant than we spent on the cost of the class."

I've literally just walked through the door home having spent the last five or so hours at the Ma-sa-man Thai Cooking School (www.thaicookingschoolbkk.com). Simply put, it has been one of the most enjoyable and affordable things I have ever done in this city. As a thai boxer I come to Thailand, especially Bangkok, on a regular basis, and had never got round to learning to cook the cuisine I so enjoy and miss back at home. Suffice to say look no further, O anonymous reader. If you're after a small class-based lesson in tantalizing thai tastes, this place is for you.Located in Ban Lum Phu on Sam Sen Soi 1 (easy to find by cab), the school is situated in a rather small but perfectly practical room lined by preparation tables and gas burners for cooking. You choose five of a list of possibly hundreds of different recipes; the more popular ones are highlighted. With a quick trip to the market to grab fresh ingredients, my day began with cooking Tom Yung Gung (Spicy and sour prawn soup), both the coconutty and the clear brothed manifestations. Chef lee is a wonderful teacher who is both patient and eminently knowledgeable. In excellent English she highlighted the differences between the street foods and those in the restaurant, as well as the differing preparation methods that us farang are often subject to in contrast to the more traditional thai ways. Naturally, following the preparation of each dish, it is promptly consumed with adequate photo opportunities. We then cooked up my favourite thai dish, Som Tam Ma La O (Spicy green papaya salad), a recipe I've been yearning to learn since first coming to this country. After making both a paste of both Red Curry (Nam Phrik Gang Phet) and Panang Curry (which uses a similar base, just with peanuts and tamarind and no eggplant) we cooked up the respective meals and ate those too. I might suggest a light breakfast is in order before coming here because most of the day is spent consuming the hard earned fruits of your labour. One Phat Thai Saig Gai/Gung (Fried thai noodles with chicken/prawns) later and a Plah Rad Phrik (fried fish with chilli sauce) to accompany, I was literally bursting at the seams. So much for the month's worth of Muay Thai and all that weight loss! To finish we made my preferred Thai dessert, Kow Neeow Ma-Muang (Coconut sticky rice with mango), thereby bringing what was a thoroughly enjoyable day to a belly-heavy end. To make things even better for the inordinately cheap 1000b cost, you receive a printout of all of the recipes cooked that day, and you're given access to the website which has all of the others.Insofar as group size goes, there was just myself and an exceptionally friendly German chap who'd spent even more time than I have in Nepal. I've heard that the class does get busy but I called desperately the night before and was able to secure a place.Chef lee is a delightful woman who knows just about all there is to know on the subject of thai cuisine. She answers every question fired at her with ease, and, as the co-owner put it, 'puts her heart and soul in every dish', Whilst not the most glitteringly new or sparklingly clean kitchen (excepting the utensils and cookingware, which was immaculate and received top marks for hygiene), you get an intimate and shockingly cheap panoramic of thai food. So see you next year when I'm back again, Mrs Lee!"

We started off with a very eye-opening visit to the market where we bought the ingredients we would need. Ms. Lee showed us what to look for, explaining substitutes for ingredients that we might not get back home in Vancouver, Canada. We prepared a green curry, green papaya salad, pad thai, tom yum goong, and a mango sticky rice desert. All from scratch, and the result was extremely surprising. Absolutely excellent.

I have a couple of would-be chefs in the family so was keen to see how sophisticated (or not) her approach was and was pleasantly surprised. My favorite bit was learning how to scrape out prawn (shrimp) brains and guts out of the heads to make a type of shrimp paste.The premises are not flash but the quality of instruction is excellent. The market trip was great and I got to ask about all the weird things I've never had the chance to ask a fluent english speaking foodie before. The Tom Yum soup and Phad Thai were very good but the Green Curry was incredible!!! Stunning. And the mango sticky rice ... what can I say?

You get to pick your own menu (we didn't want Tom Yum, and we substituted it for other noodles, and we added Papaya salad) and then you go shopping at the local market to buy the food. Chef Lee even helped us find some great cooking equipment that we (tourists) were having hard tome finding at the markets and negotiated the price lower for us. She was really great at making sure we had an A+ day. She allowed us to take pictures and was very thoughtful and would answer any question you have. This is not a tourist show and dance but rather serious cooking, and serious recipes.The food was delicious and we have some great new techniques in cooking Thai food learned from a locally trained chef. Overall, I would rate this as a great experience and will go back next time we are in Bangkok."

I just wanted one last bit of pineapple, of mixed fruit juice, of tom yum ... before flying back home ! I was lazily strolling when I was distracted by the add on the door : thai cooking lessons. I came in and immediately registered for the afternoon lesson. Good explanations, market shopping, which is very useful to figure out what vegetable or spice ... to choose, and then cooking, smelling, touching, tasting, and in the end savouring ! Hmmm, it's soooooooooooo good ! And so easy to cook when you know what to do ! Cool and clean environment, nice professional English speaking cook ... what else do you wish ? Go, enjoy !

The format of the program was perfect. They explained to us each of the different spices (and also alternatives if we can't find them back home). I would highly recommend taking a class. The Cooking School is located on the 3rd floor of their historic Old Thai Building. An amazing piece of Architecture & History. Not only was it about cooking but it was also an experience of kindness and hospitality of Thailand. Great Job. Steve & Ryan"

I will start this review by stating that we've been to many cooking schools around the world so admittedly we have high standards and expectations. The pluses of Blue Elephant:Easy to get to location by BRT (city Train)Friendly Staff (especially Chef Nun)Facilities are pretty goodBuilding itself is historic and nice to seeSome tips:Take water with you before you go to the market...especially if in the summer, it is super hot.We were told the class ended at 1, reality is it did not end until 2:00 and then we sat down to eat so we didn't actually get out of there until 2:20. The format of the class is they do a demonstration, then you go in and cook the dish, then back to the classroom for the next demonstration and then back to cook the dish...you do this for 4 dishes so it gets a bit long....it's about 1 dish too longBy the time you sit down to eat your dishes, some of the dishes were made over 2 hours ago so they are dried out and frankly not so great after sitting so longLastly, when you sit down for your lunch they will offer you wine or soft drinks...you are under the impression it is included and then you get a bill for your drinks. Since we passed on the wine, we were offered mango juice of which we agreed to. Then as we were leaving we were given a bill for an unreasonable amount. We politely mentioned that we were not told we had to pay for the drinks and it was very misleading how the drinks were offered....bait and switch...the girls at the desk had likely heard this before and quickly agreed we did not have to pay."

No enjoyment.Some students were given BTS tickets while the others (like us) who have Rabbit card have to pay our own fare. I don't see see the students paid back the money nor we were reimbursed. So is BTS fare included in the tuition fee or not?No much food ingredients in each dish. For example, Tom Yum Gong has no tomato no mushroom.

We had an amazing time, the course was very elaborate. There was a trip to the market with one of the cooks (nick)named Smile, where we got a lot of information about ingredients. We learned to make four different dishes, first by a demonstration and tasting in a classroom and then we got to cook ourselves. The facilities were great, the cooks all very friendly and the food delicious. We got some freedom to make the dishes our own, but the cooks were always available to answer questions and help us. I would definitely do it again!"

Next we sat down in their lovely classroom for some instruction on how to make the first course, followed by actually making it! We did this for four courses: crispy thai prawn cakes with pineapple sauce, pad thai with shrimp, ancient beef soup and yellow chicken curry. All four were incredibly tasty! The space is beautiful and the instructors were energetic, helpful and knowledgable and accommodating. At the end, we sat down in a gorgeous, private dining room to enjoy the meals that we had cooked! Bonuses were getting to take home leftovers, a beautiful apron, certificate of completion, recipes and Blue Elephant tote bags with curry kits to make at home. I'd recommend this class!"

We made 4 dishes (their website tells you what is made each session so you can pick the session which best suits you if you are fussy and have the time). We received the recipes to make notes on. Each dish was prepared in front of us with plenty of tips on cooking technique and variations. We then sampled before cooking our own dish at our individual work station. Everything was set up for us and cleaned up afterwards so our time was spent on cooking. The results were delicious. It was a pleasure to sit in the restaurant at the end of class and eat the four course meal I had prepared. There was far too much to eat and so staff happily packaged left overs to take home. The apron and recipes we received will be a happy reminder of a great morning.Absolutely worth it!"

She was knowledgeable about the herbs and spices used and told us interesting bits and pieces about the herbs and also what we could use in replacement if we could not find the ingredient in our respective home countries. Chef Chay continued with the next three dishes and it was demonstration followed by practice with us all having our own dishes for lunch at the end of the class.

Unfortunately our greeting (or lack thereof) set the tone for the very short experience. Upon arrival on the third floor, there was no smiling Thai welcome, just 'what reservation number' and secondly 'you pay cash or credit'. We were swiftly taken to the kitchen where we stood there until we were directed to start cooking. As far as the form to fill out upon arrival I don't understand why they need to know your hotel and room number as well as your birthdate. We left those blank. There was no 'fresh Thai herbal drink' welcome, nor a theory lesson on cooking as described in the program description. We weren't even offered to wash our hands before starting. We seemed like an inconvenience in their day. The chef was nice but didn't really seem interested in getting to know us. One of the helpers was very friendly and cracked jokes with us. The cooking was very much 'watch and repeat'. We cooked the dishes and then ate our food in the restaurant. The entire experience took 75-85 minutes and we were done at 2.30pm. Not quite a half day experience. The food was tasty. It felt very much like they were just going through the motions. There was no passion, no interest in us. We stood there awkwardly as there was not much conversation or critique beyond the helper's interaction.This was very disappointing and they did not offer what their description was, and the certificate we received for a half day cooking course... was somewhat ironic.This was an overpriced, over rehearsed production. At least we got pretty fancy aprons though."

Once at the market, which was in a sort of open air warehouse off an alley, we were told that in order to get the quality ingredients they had already been early in the morning (like 5am) and that everything left was not that good of quality. We still got to see the curry paste purveyor, vegetable seller and packaged goods (soy sauce, fish sauce, cooking oil, etc.) shop and taught how to pick out ingredients. Along the way through the market we also got some Thai iced coffee and iced tea. Once we got back to the school, we went to the demonstration kitchen where one of the chefs showed us how to make a dish and then we went across the hall to do it ourselves where the guide from the market visit was in charge. In this setup was the only problem with the class. The chef in the demonstration kitchen was modifying the printed recipe by changing the order that things were done and for how long and there seemed to be no communication between the two chefs that the recipes were modified. So the chef in the working kitchen would come by and dump some ingredient in your dish that according to what as done in demonstration should have had several steps done before it went in.The course is really geared towards being able to cook the dishes at home later and the chefs were really great about discussing alternate ingredients to use for things that may not be available at home. The food was delicious and the recipes did not require much technique to execute, mostly just knowing what ingredients to use and how to use them."

It is much like a class room where you have a video camera to give you a closer look at what's going on and a mirror above the kitchen for another angle of how the chef is preparing the food. Once the lesson is finished we all hit the main kitchen and do it ourselves. We cooked a number of dishes which provide various approaches to cooking Thai food.

We visited a local market first with the chef (which was not very interesting, having seen many produce and meat markets already), and once we got back to the classroom, spent the next 2 hours watching the chef prepare 4 complex and very different dishes, then moving to the practice kitchen and making the dishes ourselves after each demonstration. The staff watched over us and gave up tips as we worked (grate a little more ginger, add a little more fish sauce, keep stirring, etc.) and each of our dishes came out individualized as we were in control of how much ingredient we added. After we made each dish, they were numbered and put aside so that at the end, a banquet table was set up with each participant's own creations, and the class ate together in the beautiful restaurant downstairs. It was a huge amount of food - way too much to finish. At the end each person got a tote bag (poor quality- mine fell apart in days) with a box of spices, a souvenir apron, a Certificate and copies of each recipe. We will definitely be able to re-create the recipes based on this course and really enjoyed it."

This would be a 5star rating but they started off so slowly and with confusion about bookings etc. Once en route to the market by way of skytrain, it was fun (we were happy to explore by skytrain, but it did eat up some time). The market has nothing to do with the food you will be cooking there later nor with where they procure their provisions - it is essentially just for sightseeing. Back at the school, it became a well-oiled process and fast: the cooking teacher was very proficient, overhead screens were helpful, our cooking stations were always ready with everything pre-measured and chopped. Ended up learning a lot and eating well."

The food was wonderfully presented, delicious and authentic (adjusted for western palates as requested!). We were never rushed, the attendant took the time to explain the dishes, make recommendations and adjustments for my vegetarian companion. The manager was diligent in welcoming the patrons and making everyone feel at home; one really gets the sense everyone is proud of the restaurant and they really want everyone to have a great experience - and we did. The vegetarian tasting menu is delicious and expansive; also recommend the Betel leaf wraps and that evening the wild fresh red snapper filet was delicious! I know there are thousands of options for dinner in this incredible city, but I can heartily recommend that one will have a lovely dining experience at the Blue Elephant."

I do a lot of cooking at home (by no means am I a chef or a foodie.. I just like to eat good food) so I asked my guide if he knew of any cooking schools. He recommended the Blue Elephant. I came to find out that this company is relatively famous with restaurants and schools in a half dozen cities around the world. Here is the basic setup: there were about a dozen \u201cstudents\u201d (6 Tawainese women, a Korean guy, 3 from Finland, a Columbian, and me (American). We sat in little desks like I used to sit in grammar school facing the chef and his kitchen. The kitchen was setup like you see them in cooking shows with a mirror above the work surface so you could see his hands and the ingredients as well as seeing all the action on a large screen TV that was off to the side. The Chef introduced some basic Thai ingredients and tools. Then he proceeded to make a curry. We watched for about 5 minutes while he worked. At the end of this session we all got up and went across the hall where each of us had our own workstation including the ingredients, utensils, pans, stove, etc to make the curry. Once the curry was made we went back to the classroom and he showed us how to make a green papaya salad. Then back across the hall to make the salad, then back and forth 3 more times making 3 more dishes. Once the session with the chef was complete we all went downstairs to their restaurant where a table had been set for us complete with all of the food that each of us had made (to be clear, they had each of the dishes labeled so I was eating the ones that I made).I think all in all I was there for 3.5 hours. I don\u2019t remember the cost but I remember thinking it was very reasonable (less than $100USD I\u2019m sure). Once you\u2019re done doing the typical touristy things in Bangkok I\u2019d highly recommend doing this."

This is a good way to explore the backstreets that you probably wouldn't normally venture down on your own for fear of getting lost.At cooking school we made four dishes and each had our own cooking station in the kitchen, which we head off to after the demonstration by the Thai chef. We then ate the meal with our classmates in the main restaurant.Very good value for the experience and the food, as long as what you have cooked is edible - go easy on the chilli."

With the morning classes you have a tour of the local market and learn about Thai vegetables and meats - with a sampling of local coffee in a bag. Then it's back to the class room where Chef Noor makes a quick appearance and demonstrates a dish before quickly disappearing back to her busy day. After each demonstration it's off to the prep kitchen where you work to prepare what you've just seen. AC facilities, friendly staff and sometimes great new friends. I've enjoyed this most when it's lots of singles and couples in the group, so you get to chatting and meeting folks traveling the globe. The last trip in March had my friend and I matched with a group of 6 who basically stuck together and didn't want to interact with anyone else. In any event, you get an apron, a certificate, recipe sheets and a cooking set to take with you, along with great memories and a meal of your own making at the end."

Most of the ingredients had been pre cut and measured so we mainly concentrated on technique. We cooked a total of four dishes one at a time. i.e we did the demonstration of the dish then we cooked that dish, then went back and did it over again for the next dishes. The only issue with doing it this way was that by the time we got around to eating our cooking it had been sitting a while so was not as good."

Although the ingredients were pre-prepared (sliced, cut, arranged carefully so that all we had to do was combine and mix), I suspect that was due more to shortness of time than anything else. Once the core ingredients were combined, the chefs (rather than group members, which would have been more fun) then arranged to cook the fish cakes and curry - both of which tasted great."

This is a half day program where you cook a 4-course meal. There is a morning shift (8:45 am \u2013 1:00 pm) and an afternoon shift (1:00 pm \u2013 4:00 pm). My sister and I chose the morning shift. Only the morning class will have a chance to visit the local market, but the afternoon class will have a dessert lesson for substitution. My sister and I took the BTS skytrain from Siam to Surasek. The ride was not long. Once you get off the BTS, the school is literally in front of you. You can\u2019t miss it. We were the first one to arrive. One of the workers passed out a lemongrass drink as we waited. Very refreshing on a hot summer day! I enjoyed visiting the local market and learning all the different ingredients and spices. My favorite stop was the curry paste and spice shop. The smell was wonderful. The chef even stopped at one of the drink stands and bought all of us Thai tea. Afterwards, we rode the BTS skytrain back to the school where the cooking begins! The size class was comfortable with a total of 15 people. Everyone received a booklet with the dishes/recipes of the day along with an apron that you get to keep afterwards. The chef demonstrated the 4-course meal one at a time. The lesson was well organized, simple and to the point. We were able to sample the chef\u2019s dish. Each dish was amazing and cooked to perfection! After each demonstration, we would then head over to the kitchen to replicate the dish. Everyone has their own work station. I loved the hands on experience most of all. I\u2019m a beginner, so don\u2019t worry if you feel lost because there are chefs around to assist you. Take your time and have fun cooking. Afterwards, the chef presented a cooking class certificate and a Blue Elephant Cooking School tote bag with a free curry paste as a souvenir to take home. I also asked if I could take home a Tom Yum Koong (Hot and Sour Thai Soup) recipe. They were happy to pass it out. After all our hard work, we were able to sit down and enjoy our own culinary creation at the restaurant downstairs. Overall, it was a fun experience. Thank you to the chefs and sous chefs! I hope that my Thai meals will turn out just as great back at home."

So for lunch time I ordered some food from the restaurant! But We had too much food. And the afternoon session went very well too. I let him cook without my help, and went shopping in their gift shop.I highly recommend this class, the service is so nice. Have fun!!! I am sure you will enjoy.At lunch my Lamb Massaman wash more than dry, I couldn't even get angry at them who recommended that dish that wasn't edible, I didn't even have bite, they promptly offred me to change or give me something else in exchange, and apoligize so sincerely.

The classes start with a visit to the market, and then into the classroom, which is a great demo kitchen, with video screens and overhead mirrors. The chefs show you step by step a traditional Thai dish(4 in total), you taste it and then go off to the Kitchen classroom and repeat the dish. The Workstations are great everything is there for you weighed out in bowls, you simply follow the instructions and create a masterpiece......and don't worry there are chefs there to help you when you set your wok on fire. Each work station has a number, so at the end of your day your food is heated and served at the dinner table and you eat what you've made.....and you get a nice apron and certificate.I've been a chef for 35 years and still enjoy learning something new.

Neither my partner nor I are new to Thai cooking at home (he more experienced than I) however, we both wanted to see if we could move our cooking experience to the next level. We were not disappointed as this basic introductory one-afternoon class, offered some of the traditional methods of balances spices in Thai Cooking. From bashing Coriander roots, Garlic and Shallots properly in a pestle and mortar, the class delivered some fundamental knowledge to add to our Thai cooking skills. A basic class suitable for anyone, this would suit anyone, even those who have no Thai cooking experience at all. As such, it is very relaxed and our chef made it not only look easy, but very simple to do. And it was! We felt like we could do nothing wrong and we did not. We started with deep fried paper prawns and something new for us, the Sweet Pineapple dipping sauce to go with it (Nam Jin Sub Pa Rod); which we have made at home a couple times since without failure. Simple and delicious I found the class very exciting. Each meal is demonstrated first and then you move directly into the kitchen where you do the practical for ourselves. Great Fun! The dishes are then numbered for each student and set aside to later be served and enjoyed by everyone in the restaurant downstairs.The Bangkok Blue Elephant Cooking School is housed in a beautiful building, reminiscent of the great English houses built in the far east at the turn of the 19th century. High Ceilings and cool breezes through wooden shuttered windows made our welcoming drinks of Pineapple and Coconut all the more appreciated having come from the hot, humid, busy city. Chef Nooror So many Steppe is very proud of her hall of fame and you will be joining quite a few celebrities who have also come here to master the basics of Thai cuisine. Very simple, but once learned never forgotten, and since returning home we have really enjoyed not only those recipes we learned, but added the basic principles we learned, to many other Thai dishes as well with success.This basic introductory class is not hard core or stressing, or made for an elite grand master of Thai cooking. It is for the everyday person who doesn't really know much about Thai, but wants to learn more. For those like us, it is an interesting activity in the heart of Bangkok."

They bring out all the dishes you have done to the table at the end of the lessons all reheated for you to enjoy.I know it's not cheap but we felt it was worthwhile, its a fantastic treat."

I took the afternoon cooking class with my wife, we both enjoy cooking and Asian food so this was a great chance to learn some new techniques and recipes. During the class you will cook many dishes, first the teacher will prepare the dish and then you replicate it on your own, at the end of the class they serve your dishes to you in the restaurant (or pack them to take with you). The facilities and the restaurant are very impressive and the chef teaching the class was very good at demonstrating the recipes. The only complaint I have is that I felt the pace of the class was a bit rushed, and the chef disappeared often after his demonstration was complete and we were cooking on our own. The class is a bit pricey but I did learn some new techniques, if you are interested in learning Thai cooking I would recommend the course."

Our group of 6 was taken by a chef to a nearby market for a walkthrough and introduction to Thai ingredients. Back at the school another chef gave us demos for each of the four dishes we'd cook. Then went to another kitchen where we cooked. At the end of the class, we were all seated in restaurant and served the food we prepared. Great time! The price was a little higher than I thought going in -tax and service charge- but more than worth it. Will take the afternoon class the next time I'm in Bangkok."

We then went back and learned how to cook four fantastic dishes. Two them will be made several times going forward when I get back home. Clean classroom, expert cook. What will end up making this class is who attends. This would not be as fun if there is only two or three in the group. We were a total of four which worked out perfectly. Believe there can be a maximum of eight. After you finish, your dishes are served to you in the restaurant downstairs. Worth the price. A great memory."

We had been to the Blue Elephant previously for dinner and found the food to be very good, if a bit pricey, the staff very skilled, and the atmosphere of the place to be classic Thai. With such good memories of our dining experience we were looking forward to cooking and eating our own Thai dishes. We were not disappointed. There were only 7 of us in the class so the instruction was very peron to person and heavily hands on. Our chef instructor was delightful and skilled as she demonstrated in the demonstration kitchen each dish we would individually prepare. Then we crossed the hall to a spacious kitchen where each of us had our own cooking space with mortar and pestle, gas burner, wok, knives and other cooking utensils. The kitchen prep staff had pre measured and prepared the necessar ingredients for each dish, we followed the written recipe plus the previous instructions demonstrated in the demo kitchen to prepare each dish. We prepared five dishes, a pastery wrapped prawn appetizer, dipping sauce, a marinated tenderloin salad, a yellow shrimp curry, and a Massaman beef curry. Between each dish we returned to the demo kitchen to watch the chef prepare the next dish, then returned to our cooking stations to make the same dish. A very effective and fun way to learn the preparation of each dish. We got a certificate of completion, a Blue Elephant apron, and best of all a beautiful table was set for us in the restaurant where we served the dishes we had each individually prepared. Yummy! A really fun afternoon of cooking and dining. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys cooking and Thai food."

This goes double for chefs and cooking school instructors because, no question about it, being a chef and teaching how to cook are two quite different things. My cooking class at the famous Blue Elephant Royal Thai Cuisine restaurant in Bangkok was not unpleasant (with the exception of a bad experience touching my face after slicing chili peppers), but it wasn't wonderful. The good part was that the Blue Elephant restaurant and cooking school is in a wonderful, colonial era building just across from the BTS skytrain stop in Sathorn and the teaching rooms are great, a classroom with video monitors to give great views for the cooking demonstration that precedes the hands on lesson, and a cool working kitchen where students get to prepare recipes. The not so great part was an instructor ho is probably an excellent chef, but just didn't seem enthused about teaching three women how to make recipes he has made a million times. It felt like the less he had to deal with the three of us the better. The only person who showed any interest in us was the boss, Chef Nooro Somany Steppe, who popped in and had us try some items she was testing out. She surely has charisma as well as talent, but our instructor seemed to be struggling through the painful process of teaching us. Instructor issues aside, the recipes we were taught to prepare were very tasty. At the end of the class we sat in the empty dining room and ate what we had prepared. It was just two of us students and no one spoke to us or had anything to do with us once we sat down at the table with our dishes in front of us. I found this a bit off-putting. It didn't make me want to rush back for a meal at the place. Still, the class was fun, if somewhat pricey, and one of my fellow students was a pleasure to meet. It might be more fun to do this class with a group of your friends and to see if you can get more time with Chef Somany Steppe."

The one thing I was very much interested in experiencing when in Bangkok last October 2013, was attending a cooking class and learning more about Thai Cuisine. We only had one full day in Bangkok and had high expectations on spending that day well. Blue Elephant did not disappoint.Blue Elephant was recommended to me by my manager and checking out their website, which was very informative, made me interested in taking up the recommendation. Booking from Melbourne was an easy experience, just filling in a form and providing credit card details. This was just to secure the booking, we didn't have to pay until we arrived. I chose a morning session as these also included a trip to a traditional Thai fresh food market as well as the cooking class itself. We took the train to the market and were shown Thai fruits and vegetables and even got to taste some. We were also treated to traditional Thai iced coffee or tea. Our guide's was very informative and answered all questions with ease. I really enjoyed this part of the class. Back at the Cooking School, we were sat in a room with little chairs with desks, a pack with recipes and information about Thai ingredients and a very entertaining, enthusiastic Chef. He seemed to love his job and was a pleasure to learn from. After he demonstrated how to cook each dish, we would head into the cooking room and try it out ourselves. I just wish every time I could someone would prepare all the ingredients in little bowls ready for you to cook! It was also great being able to head downstairs in the end and eat the food we had cooked ourselves. I would definitely recommend this cooking class to all. My only gripe was the food we cooked weren't kept as warm as it could. I would recommend cooking the fried noodle dish last as this dish is meant to be eaten straight away when piping hot."

Just started following the girl to find out that we are taking the Sky Train to the station we just came from. We asked and learnt that we are heading to the market. It was a small local market, not the nicest in town. One and a half hour later we got back to the Blue Elephant. We stayed in a nice classroom and enjoyed a very good instructor. Priofesional, good English. Each dish was also practiced nearby and this part of the day was well organized. We then wend downstairs to eat our cocking. Dishes were nice. It seems that they do have the basics but lack all the required to treat you personally. Perhaps like a bus station with clients coming and going. Sorry.

The cook who went with us picked up a few things as we tasted, smelled, and gagged at some of the interesting items. Loved the fish, the bugs (HUGE june-bug looking things used in spices)... then back to the school where we watched the demos of what we would be cooking (loved the overhead mirrors for better viewing). Then we headed into the cooking areas, all getting our own space for hands-on, step by step guidance...was truly fun, interesting, entertaining. Once cooked, we cleaned up, and they presented our own food to us on an elaborated decorated table for lunch! Superb experience!

We then went next door to the kitchen and each had our own burner and group of apprentices to give is pointers when we got lost. You can either take the food you cook away or have it resented to you in the restaurant . I would suggest this as it was lovely to sit down and eat the lovely food you had made.

Plus, the school is just on the other side of the street where I stayed so might as well.When I came to the restaurant, we were given a glass of refreshment and were given a quick briefing on the stuff that we'll do during the morning class. Our guide, Maurin (I think that was her name), looked like the Thai actress Sudarat Budtporm. We were taken to the market near Saphan Taksin BTS station and toured around. We didn't use those ingredients in the market, but it was the first time for me to try Mangosteen and it was amazing! I've been to Thailand many times but I'm ashamed that this was the first time I tried such amazing tasting fruit.Anyways, after the tour, we went back and we went to the classroom where our instructor, chef Nat, taught us to cook 4 dishes. There are different dishes to cook in the morning and in the afternoon every day of the week, so choose the day on which dish you wish to cook, unless you want to cook all of them. He gave us a lot of tips and answered a lot of our questions too, while breaking a few jokes here and there.Alternating on each dish, we cook our own on the kitchen beside the classroom. It was an intimidating task to be honest. It was my first time in a real kitchen, and I kinda feel the intensity on how these cooks do stuff on a normal day to day basis. Nonetheless, I had a blast.After cooking, we were given our certificates and we went down to the restaurant to eat our own dishes. Like the other comments, the food is slightly cold already, but I guess it was fine since the dishes are spicy. I did love the dishes, especially the Red Shrimp curry, although I was a bit disappointed because the shrimp that included in my ingredients was not fresh, I can taste it on the shrimp. Ironic, I know. It was the best and worst at the same time.I would've given 5 stars if it weren't for those mishaps. Nonetheless, I would definitely go back and if I have enough money, I would enroll on a whole week's class."

Back to the school we got some nice free aprons (to keep) and recipe sheets. We then watched the chef prepare the 4 courses. After each course we went to the kitchen to cook it ourselves. The chef was funny and easy to follow. I am not a big fan of certain fish and when she found this out she shelled some prawns for me to cook my fish dish which I preferred. You can choose to take your food away or eat it in the restaurant. We chose to eat ours in the restaurant and the staff there heated the food up for us. Problem with this was that they served the 4 courses at the same time which meant that the dishes were quite cold by the time we got to eat it all however they did give us free dessert !All in all a good experience by knowledgable staff but it was quite pricey."

We were told to be there at 8:30 and did not start until 9:30--once we got coffee, life was a bit better. No one told us what or who we were waiting for.2. I was there until almost 2:30 pm--much longer than I expected, glad I didn't have anywhere to go. 3. They have no system...everyone paid separately and it took a half hour to get all 15 of us paid.4. The price the concierge at our hotel gave us did not include a service charge...thought it was about $95 and it was more like $110--still worth it, just a surprise. 5. As others mentioned, you get your food at the end, and it is cold. I am happy I tasted along the way so I could get a sense of my food hot. 6. I am not a drinker, but I know other classes in Thailand offer wine. I was there Sunday morning so not sure about the afternoon classes. If this is important to you, ask. 7. Everyone cooks their own food so if you really don't want to cook, this is not the class for you."

Suggest you book a course in the morning as you get a visit to a local market included, taken by one of the chefs and certainly saw the true Thai market - not for the squeamish. Was greeted with a cool refreshing glass of herbal tea and then the fun began. Each dish was cooked in front of you in a show kitchen and then you went into one of the kitchens to replicate. At the end you can either eat your ware in the restaurant or have it wrapped up for take away - suggest you do this as by the end of day you have been tasting every dish and are full up. Given a small bag of goodies to take home. A brilliant day for foodies!!!"

The only negative I have is that the instructions given while demo-ing the meals were different from the printed recipes. It'll be interesting to see if I can replicate them from my notes.Otherwise, this was a great experience. You get to tour the market, get some thai coffee or tea, learn about the foods which was really fun. You spend the morning cooking the meals and, when finished, they put everything in one of the larger dining rooms for the class to eat together. There is so much food to begin with and then they add more: chicken satay, green curry, green beans and coconut and lychee ice cream. Needless to say, there was a lot of leftover food b/c there was no way I could eat everything. This was a great experience and I highly recommend it."

The school run courses from half a day to whole days and the menu you will cook varies each day so try and organise this in advance (I did the day before). The morning class includes a trip to the market but the afternoon class doesn't. There were 4 of us which made the experience much better. Good instructions and great recipes. I agree with some reviewers that the food you cook should be heated for your sit down meal at the end as it was luke warm. I recommend this course."

My husband and I booked into the morning class for a Sunday morning late Saturday night and were thrilled to get a spot at the Blue Elephant Cooking School. The cost for the 3-4 hour session was 2,900 Baht each (plus 10% service charge). We tried to get into Silom Thai Cooking School, but it was already full - perhaps because the price is only 1,000 Baht per person.I really enjoyed all of the food we cooked (4 dishes) and will go home and make at least three of them right away.The market tour was a bit underwhelming. My husband is half Cambodian and we've lived in Asia for a bit, so many of the ingredients were not new to us. The \"market\" we went to was also not very busy and seemed a bit dead. Perhaps because we went on Sunday morning. If you're new to Southeast Asian cooking, definitely go on the market tour. If we return for a morning class, we may just sleep in longer and skip that part.After the tour, we sat in a classroom to learn one dish at a time, then we applied our learnings in the kitchen by making an individual portion of the dish. What was nice about this was we could cook everything to our own taste. For example, if we were given 5 bird's eye chilis, I used only three.I had to write every single recipe as the ones provided are too vague and something factually incorrect. I also wish that the instructor provided more support during our cook time. We were kind of left to ourselves, and a few people burned things because they didn't know how to control the heat on their burners.Nonetheless, I'm really glad my husband and I took the class. It was a great experience. We learned some helpful new tips for cooking Thai food, and we cannot wait to go home and cook!I would like to try Silom Thai Cooking School next time we're in Bangkok to compare the two, but I would definitely return to Blue Elephant, too."

There was no rush and Nat took the time to answer my questions and ensure I learned everything I wanted to. The food we cooked was excellent (all down to Khun Nat and not myself, sadly) and was straightforward enough that I will be able to apply it at home.Included are your recipes, a Blue Elephant apron and a take home cook-at-home thing.Oh and afterwards you get sat in the restaurant and the food you haven't already scoffed while tasting in the kitchen (!) is served to you, plus a yummy Thai dessert.Tip: If you can afford it, I'd highly recommend getting a private class. You will still go to the market with the main group in the morning but after that you have 1:1 attention and more time and space to yourself, plus you get to choose which dishes you would like to cook."

Then, I made a reservation to take morning cooking class of 1week program 1MONTH prior to check in day. After I arrived to cooking class, I was told that some of the classes are full of 30 people and I have to give up because of them.  So I had to give up 4days of morning class and take it in the afternoon instead. It was not only totally ruined my plan and feeling but also my family as well. We were very disappointed and upset about it. They only said that they could not open my application in the computer on the 2nd day of the class.  If it was the technical problem, why didn't they ask me to send it again before I arrive? I feel like I waist my time because we could not really do anything for the day: the class take a place in the middle of the day which makes it hard to plan to go to somewhere far. I wish they have told me earlier so it might have been happy ending while I was staying in Bangkok for a week with my family.  I did not want to ruin the image of the school but I just want people don't get treated this way again in the future.  However, the cooking class with Nut chef was great besides this incident. He was the best teacher and his food was tasty to compare to other chefs."

            "review": "Thai cooking classes in elegant historic premises, however.... The Blue Elephant Cooking School is a Bangkok institution, offering competent training in elegant historic premises. Unfortunately it has one fatal flaw...I had heard good things about Blue Elephant (BE), and was looking forward to meeting the team at my Saturday morning class. On arrival at the BE address via the BTS, I was dismayed to discover the elegant premises were under renovation AND suffering the encroachment of nearby office construction. But I digress... I came for the cooking school, not the architecture.A bit before the allotted start time a BE staff member distributed some lemongrass tea which was a nice touch and increased the ambience for our rather eclectic group.BE has an active restaurant downstairs as well as a cooking school upstairs in an elegant old wooden building that was once a department store in 1912 according to the brass plate affixed near the door. Fees are high at 3,000 baht and they do not offer a hotel pickup service unlike some competitor cooking schools. The upstairs are is split into a classroom and an instruction room with around 10 well-equipped cooking stations. All very clean and well laid out... one minor quibble was the lack of a hand washing area for course attendees who had to use the kitchen sink... but so far, so good.Our class first had an excursion to the local markets via BTS, and this was a very interesting part of the course. We were able to taste a variety of fresh fruits and ask questions as they arose. We then headed back to the classroom\u2026BE conducts the theory and instruction part of each dish in the classroom, then the entire class moves next door to cook it, while the teacher and a team of assistants move from station to station to assist and advise. The inconvenience of having to move 4 times during the one teaching session was a bit annoying, but then the bombshell drops\u2026 you don't get to eat the hot, freshly prepared dish! It is whisked away to be served later (nearly stone cold) at the group lunch downstairs. This is the Achilles heel of the whole BE operation in my view.Other cooking schools I have been to have a far more successful model, which flows smoothly.They cook a dessert dish first, which needs to be cooled down while preparing other dishes, each 'entree' dish is then cooked and eaten straight afterwards, piping hot. The final main course dish is cooked, and ONLY this dish is whisked away by the support staff to be served to the group with the cooled dessert dish prepared earlier.Overall summary is... great location and ambience (esp the downstairs restaurant despite the encroaching office buildings) very high quality course notes, apron and equipment. Friendly and competent teaching from a very knowledgeable professional cook who made learning fun.However, for me the 'deal breaker' at Blue Elephant is the disjointed structure of the cooking course... I don't want to eat cold food a couple of hours after it was cooked! Unless the management can restructure the course to enable it to flow better I'm afraid I can't recommend it and won't be back."

Chef demonstrates each dish for you in the classroom then you get to get your hands dirty trying out the recipe yourself. The best part, well depending on what type of a cook you are, is that you get to eat your food in the restaurant or they will pack it up for you to take away.

However the portions given for us to cook were different and not correct, ie there was always too much of one or more ingredients (we were later told by one the assistants), but we were asked to put everything into the dish during the class so the taste didn't turn out quite right. Everything seemed a bit rushed. They offer to have you eat the dishes you had cooked but everything was cold by that time - all the students left their dishes after one or two tastes. Was a shame to waste. A saw one student asking for all her dishes to be packed up so if that suits you then please ask them up front.

The head chef was late and there was no formal announcement what the camera crew was filming for or even if anyone would prefer not to be filmed. It wasn't until my friend started talking to them that we started to understand more what it was all about. The chef apparently is quite famous and regularly has film crews coming through her school so perhaps she is used to them but for the students there it was a bit of a shock and unprofessional not to be told ahead of time that they would be there. Also, this caused major delays with the lesson and we finished 1.5 hours behind schedule due to having to wait for the film crew to finish before starting on a new dish. A few people in the class were getting impatient. While the dishes were ok and instruction was fairly good, the film crew and how the head chef handled them was a big disappointment."

We were given full demonstrations of each meal we would be cooking and then went to our own separate cooking stations to prepare our meal. The instructors were very friendly and passionate about Thai cooking. Several sous chefs were on hand to help us as we cooked. After we were done cooking, we all sat around a long table and shared our meal together. We each cooked four dishes. It was more food than anyone could eat. It was all delicious! We were also given an apron, a folder with recipes and food chart, bottled water, tote bag and a prepackaged BE spice packet. Our train fare and food samplings at the market were all taken care of by the staff. Everyone spoke very good English.

He always told us what he was doing and even explained why he would use a certain ingredient. If he ever didn't follow the recipe exactly, he'd tell us why. After watching him make two dishes, we went into the kitchen to make them. There were lots of staff members there to help us out if we needed it, but they mostly left us alone to do it ourselves. After the first two, we repeated the process of watching and then cooking the last two dishes. At the end, we all went into the restaurant and ate our meals together.

The course is prepared by the chef tasted by the pupils which then go into another room where the ingredients were weighed and partly precut (not the lemongrass, chili etc so you\u00b4d better know how to handle a knife) and the pupils cook by themselves (with a lot of help from nice ladies). Afterwards you do have a feast of your own cookings in the main restaurant. It was more than enough food, we got lots of explanations in good english and a lot of helpful hints. All in all a feast.Important notice: Do not plan to eat anything after this for at leat 6 full hours and neither plan anything which you wouldn\u00b4t normally do well and truly stuffed at 30 degrees C."

I learned a lot about the markets and the Thai cuisine which helped in my shopping and food adventures the rest of my trip. I also met other tourists and travellers from just about every corner of the world which good tips on what to see next.The restaurant is very easy to get to using public transportation. It is just outside the Surasak Skytrain stop. When we arrived at the restaurant, we sat in a small lounge and sipped on a very refreshing lemongrass drink. When going to the market, we ended up getting back on the Skytrain and walking a short way to the market.The market was full of smells, sounds, and tastes. We got to try Thai coffee which is given to you in a bag with a straw. We tried a sweet Thai dessert. The restaurant already has the ingredients ready at the restaurant. This was mainly time for the instructors to show us the different Thai herbs, meats, and fruits. It was a great experience.Once we got back to the restaurant, we each had our own desk with a binder with our recipes and an embroidered apron, all of which we got to take home! The instructors show us how to prepare each meal and share tips for using the kitchen tools and subsitute ingredients if we cannot find the original ones back home. After each demo, we went to the practice room, where I felt like I was on the Food Network. We have our own workstation, with portioned out ingredients in little bowls. After making four (yes, four!) different meals, we got to eat our masterpieces in the restaurant downstairs. There was so much food I couldn't even eat it all. At the end of the class, we received our certificate and a small gift set of Thai sauces. It was a great start to the day!"

The chef's do a great job showing you how to make the dishes there and what to do when you get home (if you can't find certain ingredients, etc). I did the morning class which went to the market (honestly I did not learn that much at the market, but it was cool to see it). This is definitely not the cheapest cooking class in town, but you absolutely get what you pay for."

I did the morning class, so had the trip to the nearby market to try some fruits, and see some sights; just a usual Bangkok food market but worth a look if you've never been. Then back to the school for the class. The chefs I had were fluent in English. They start out by making the dish while you watch and ask questions, you then try their creation before heading into the kitchen to try it yourself. Don't worry there is a tap in there to wash your hands before getting dirty. Each dish is done one at a time, so you're not over loaded with recipes. Afterwards you have the choice to eat your meal in their restaurant or have it to go. Overall pretty good, a little expensive, but I still enjoyed it a lot. Try not to get your apron too dirty as you get to keep it."

On the day we were there, both the founder and her daughter each came in to teach us a dish each. I look forward to recreating some of the dishes I learnt in my own kitchen."

At first I had reservations about spending my last day in Bangkok in the classroom, but being a keen cook and a lover of Thai food I decided to give it a go. I wasn't disappointed.The morning started with a refreshing Lemongrass drink before heading off to a local market with our instructor Charles, who was very knowledgable and entertaining. The market is one stop on the BTS. At the market we were introduced to different fruits and veg native to Thailand, how to buy the best fish and got to taste a thai iced coffee, pancakes and sweet desserts. It was also really interesting to see locals purchasing their ingredients.Back at the school we were provided with a pack containing the recipes we'd be cooking together with an apron, which we got to keep. At the end of the session we were also provided with a goody box containing Blue Elephant herbs, spices, curry paste and sauces and also a certificate for sucessfully completing the course.In addition to the trip to the market, Thursday's session also included demonstrations of Tom Klong Koong (Spicy & Sour North Eastern Prawn Soup), Plaa Phaow Samoon Prai (Grilled or Baked Seabass with herbs in a Banana leaf), Kaeng Phed Ped Yaang (Red Curry with Roast Duck) and Laab Kai (Spicy Chicken Salad). After each demonstration we went off to our small cooking area to follow the recipe. Everything was well organised and co-ordinated. At the end of all the cooking each of the meals we had cooked were served to us in the restuarant downstairs. They even gave you the opportunity to invite a guest. My boyfriend (who is not a cook!) came and meet me for lunch before we headed off to the airport.The Blue Elephant is easy to get to using the BTS to Surasak station. It is located directly adjacent to the BTS station.I would recommend this to anyone with an interest in Thai food and cookery. I had a fantastic time and found it really rewarding. I was one of the highlights of my trip to Thailand and I have put it to good use by recreating some of the recipes since I've been back in the UKDo it and enjoy it."

We enjoyed the half-day cooking school on Monday, which meant we learned to make Spicy and Sour Prawn Soup, Chicken with Green Curry, Thai Fish Cakes, and Pad Thai. Our instructor, Charles, was highly entertaining and experienced. The trip to the market before the class was one of the highlights, as Charles introduced us to different seafood, fruits, vegetables, roots and herbs that we were unfamiliar with. We sampled several items and had Thai-style iced tea or iced coffee, which was unlike anything we'd ever had before. Back in the class, for each course, Charles would demonstrate how to use the ingredients to prepare the course, classroom style, explaining the purpose of each ingredient and how and how not to substitute if we can't find these ingredients back home. We sampled his dish, and then we entered the kitched, where each person had his own station, his own ingredients and equipment. We prepared one course, then went back in to the classroom to learn the next, and so on, four times. For each course, we marked our plates with our station number, and when we were done preparing all four courses, we went to the beautiful dining room where a table was set for us with all four of our dishes at our place. We enjoyed eating our food together.This was a great learning experience, made fun by Charles.It couldn't be easier to get to Blue Elephant. It's right at the Surasak station of the Skytrain."

My partner and I did a half-day cooking class with a lovely tutor, Ni, who took us to a local food market and gave us a fun tour where we learned about and tasted all kinds of new (and obscure) Thai produce. Her knowledge and presentation were very good, and she had a strong rapport with the local sellers.Back at the beautiful old building housing the cookery school, we sat in a well-equipped teaching room where we watched Ni demonstrate methods and prepare ingredients then cook four different dishes. We tasted each dish as it was complete then went to individual work stations in the kitchen, where, using a recipe sheet and with as much or as little guidance as required we cooked and presented the same dish. When all four courses were complete we gathered to eat our food in the pretty restaurant.The results were great! My partner and I shared all our dishes and both achieved very pleasing plates which tasted amazing and far more authentic than most restaurants dish up to tourists. We were given recipe folders and aprons and little gift sets to take away, and I honestly feel confident that we will be able to repeat the dishes with the same success back home.I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in cooking authentic Thai food. Ni's knowledge, teaching style, enthusiasm, food and her market tour really made this morning a success and I would happily go back again to learn more."

As for the actual cooking, we prepared five of the most popular Thai dishes. I can't wait to test my newfound knowledge when I return home.

The other class participants were great! There was a couple from Germany, a guy from France, and a Canadian family with three grade school kids who had been living in Australia for the past couple of years and returning back to Canada. We all enjoyed the class and the dishes we made.Five stars for Mae and the cooking class and her staff! We booked the morning class which includes a market tour. After arriving at the cooking school, Mae led us out and got several tuk tuks for a short ride to the market. The morning market tour was interesting with all the various spices, produce, noodles, fish, chicken, meats, etc. Mae purchased some ingredients for the class, including freshly grated coconut.For our class, we made curry paste for our chicken green curry, shrimp pad thai, tom yum soup and mango sticky rice. Mae also showed us how to make coconut cream and coconut milk for the mango sticky rice from the fresh coconut she purchased.Yes, to get to the cooking school you are walking through some old alleys and building. However, the cooking school and everything inside was very clean. There was air conditioning inside the school, including the cooking area, which is greatly appreciated! Cleanliness and sanitation practices were very good, such as keeping the cooking stations clean, constant hand washing and proper storage/refrigeration of perishable foods. Each student is assigned a colored clip to keep track as each dish is made; you put your color clip on your plate/bowl, so you know what's your dish when they bring it upstairs to the dining/eating area! The directions to Maliwan (on their website) are clear and easily found on google maps. However our taxi driver tried to scam us, even though our hotel told him exactly where to go and gave him the directions and printed map. He would call someone on his cell phone, sounded like he was asking for directions (probably trying to increase the time/distance), even though I showed him my cell phone with our location on google maps. Then he overshot the location, called someone again even though I showed him my phone with the google map clearly showing our location just a block away. We probably should have just bailed out of the cab at that point and paid him what was on the meter. When he pulled up to where he should have originally dropped us off, he tried to charge more than the meter because he said he had to call and use his phone. I argued with him that it was supposed to be the meter and just gave him a little more although I should have just paid the meter price. It was his loss for trying to scam us because if he hadn't played the trick of overshooting the location and trying to charge us for having to call for directions, I would have given him more with a tip.Once out of the cab, we used my phone and google maps to find the building but many of the local vendors were very friendly and asked \"cooking school?\" and pointed the way for us to go.When the class was over and we tried to catch a cab back towards Ploen Chit BTS, several cabs stopped but the drivers said \"no\" when we asked to go to Ploen Chit. Mae came out with the afternoon class and we told her we were having trouble trying to get a cab, so she was very helpful and suggested asking the cab to drop us at Ratchatewi BTS and helped us hail a cab and spoke with the driver for us, so we were able to get back. This cab driver was nice, used the meter and did not try anything.Maliwan Thai Cooking class is good. Also, I've taken the Cooking with Poo class and enjoyed that class too. So I would recommend taking either Maliwan or Cooking with Poo if you're interested in a Thai cooking class, depending on where you're staying in Bangkok. If you're in the city area with easy access to the BTS, take the Cooking with Poo. If you're staying more in the Khaosan or Chao Phraya River area with boat access, Maliwan would probably be more convenient. So we enjoyed our class and Mae is really nice, helpful, and a good teacher. Highly recommend Maliwan Thai Cooking class!"

There were not clear as the taxi got lost several times. That is why we arrived 20mins late and the teacher and the other person they had (only 1 more) were alredy in the market.A woman in the school gave me a phone in order to talk to the teacher, who told us to wait in the class instead of inviting us to joing them in the market. The way she taked was unpolite and that is why we decided to leave and not taking the class.Some days later we did a cooking course with another school who was much for caring and proffesional. The instructions where clear, they advise us where to go and what to do if we arrive late and gave us the way to go to the class from our hotel. The communication via mail was super easy and they ask us to confirm the day before to make sure. None of things are made by Maliwan Thai cooking school.Some suggestions: 1)give better instructions. 2)If you are going to leave to the market if someone arrives a little late advise it in a mail before taking the class.3) More flexibility. We are tourist, we have no idea how is the traffic or where the place is, so if we arrive late it would be nice to give us the chance to go to the market. Offerd a tuk tuk or something like that. We pay a a lot of money (we were 5!) for the whole experience, including the market.In conclusion, this is why is would not reccomend this cooking class."

Everything is very well organized from your schedule to how everything moves in the kitchen. It made it all so easy, but never once did we feel rushed. Mae would first demonstrate how to make the dish, let us taste hers, and then go back to our stations to do it ourselves. One thing we loved is they didn't have every single ingredient measured out exactly. You get an idea of how much to put in from her demonstration, but you can then \"spice it up\" or down to your liking. The location is a little difficult, but we had no problem getting there. Here's what I would do, email Mae beforehand and ask her to send you instructions/address (WRITTEN IN THAI) that you can show a taxi driver, then go to their website and take a photo of the map they have on their \"contact us\" page, it's a really simple map. The taxi will be able to drop you off at least in the proximity of the class, and you can then use that picture you took of their map to find it. That's what we did and it was so simple! Didn't get lost once. We loved our experience here and if we come back with new friends we will definitely be taking them to Maliwan Thai Cooking Class."

If you're going to do anything whilst staying near Khoa San Road - please go here! Such easy meals which I'll definitely make when I'm back home in the UK. Highly recommended! (Plus you get a certificate!)"

Our taxi driver had trouble finding where to drop us off, but if you follow the directions and head down the alley and turn right you will find it at the end. Don't let the location down the alley worry you, once you arrive you will take off your shoes and go upstairs to a very professional kitchen set up perfectly for your class with a dining area up another flight of stairs with excellent air conditioning. We loved going to a local market and learning about the meats, vegetables, spices and fruits. Mae even had a specific place to purchase fresh spring roll wrappers and you can even watch as they are made. After the market, you go back and each student cooks their own individual dishes. We made 4 different things and each one was amazing! Don't miss this opportunity if you are in Bangkok!"

Although I'm a novice in the kitchen, Mae and her very hard working assistant made the class fun and really helped us appreciate Thai cooking and the work that goes into each dish. The class was hands-on, but it was not too difficult for someone like me with very little cooking experience. Mae took us to a local market to select fresh vegetables and other ingredients and then led us through the preparation and cooking of a traditional Thai meal. The facilities were extremely clean the kitchen was well stocked, and everyone was encouraged to follow proper hygiene protocols throughout the meal preparation. At the end of the class, we sat down to enjoy a delicious meal...the finest Thai food I had ever tasted (must have been Mae's exceptional instruction)!Finding the location of the class can be a little challenging, so don't forget your map from the website and look for the sign at the end of the alley. It took us about 30 minutes by taxi from the JW Marriott, which was well worth the time and effort. This was absolutely one of the highlights of our vacation! In fact, we were tempted to come back the next day to cook and sample some new dishes. I highly recommend this class for anyone who appreciates Thai food and wants to have some fun in Bangkok."

Decided to try this school due to the reviews and price.Online Booking reservations was easy and we got a reply within the same day. they've also included a map and directions in Thai for the taxi driver. Started off with a market tour where Mae was very good in introducing the various food and ingredients as well as answering whatever questions we have. The market tour was really interesting as they have stuffs that we very rarely see back home. back in the school, the cooking lesson was straight forward and to easy to follow. all the ingredients and seasoning pre-laid out and portioned for you before start of each dish. you can still adjust the taste to your liking by adding more or less of the ingredient. it is difficult to go wrong with the dishes. after cooking we get to enjoy the fruits of our labor. the only minus is that as the green curry was the first dish to be cooked, it become a little thick and cool by the time we eat.overall a good and enjoyable class! thank you!"

I thought we had to choose what we wanted to make, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that we actually made everything on the menu.

Signed up cos I was interested in learning about the Thai ingredients. A typical menu consists of a curry, a dessert and 2 more main dishes. You get to learn to make the curry paste from scratch. Choose from their standard menu or customise one for yourself for a little more premium. Still very much value for money. We were greeted by Mae when we arrived and was promptly brought to the 3rd floor to fill out a registration form and drinks while we waited. Much needed in the hot summer months. Class started with a tour of their local market before returning. All ingredients are already cleaned and prepared for you and no washing is required. They have taken the most irritating part of cooking out for you. Even the quantity is portioned out in advance. They have assistants who will make sure the class goes on smoothly and what ingredient is required will be on the table when you need it. Demonstrations and step by step instructions were provided. Very hands on. Prepare to get your hands dirty. Instructor Mae was also very patient in the teaching. After the class, sit down and enjoy the fruits of your labour. They complete the experience well by giving out certificates to each participant."

On my last day in bongkok I decided to do this class, I had previously found it on TripAdvisor and decided to do it as it was within walking distance from my hotel. It was a bit hard to find and the area wasn't looking the best, but inside was really furnished and set up for cooking, there was 7 of us and we each had our station with stoves pots,ingredients and utensils. Mea our instructor took us my tuk tuk to the market to buy our fresh ingredients for our recipes. The market was eye opening about thai cooking and lifestyle, we saw baskets of seafood, vegetables we didn't knew exist,eg small eggplants of different colours, mints,curries eggs yellow, red and green curry paste freshly made,chicken with unlaid eggs, live fish,vendors that have a machine to grate coconut for milk and cream, fruits like mangosteen, mangoes and tamarind that can be used in cooking. We then returned to school where we then proceeded to watch Mea demonstrate to us ,we then tasted the finished dish and then cooked our own.Mea made every thing seems so easy and everyone had great results from their dishes.we all got a certificate at end of class. We all sat down to have lunch after we have finished doing our 4 dishes, Mea provided rice to accompany our meat dishes, which some of us were able to have later for dinner at our hotels. I would definitely recommend this class."

There are so many options of cooking classes available in Bangkok and it is not so easy to choose one. However, this one did not seem commercialized like some others and I should say I made the right choice.The experience was simply awesome since the beginning till the end. I was warmly greeted when I arrived. They had taken note of my allergy as well. It was a small group of 5 persons.I loved the trip to the local market where we bought fresh produce to be used later during the class.Back to the class and the trainer first demonstrated the recipes, we tasted and then made out own. We could also adjust the taste as per our likes (more or less spicy, more coconut milk or not etc\u2026 which was very nice). After preparing 4 different recipes, we had lunch and could not believe that we really made those Thai dishes. The plus point: the trainer was the highlight, with very good humor and proudly answering all our questions and explaining the different vegetables, spices at the market. She also provided alternatives to some spices that might not be found in your country. I definitely recommend this class.Location tip : no public transportation like BTS going in this area except for some buses. It was a little bit hard to find the place but this is not a huge issue. Note that it is not located on the main road when you reach there. You should look for a marrow street."

Clear and fluent with English which helps us learn quicker and faster, especially for bachelors with only scrambled eggs cooking experience lol. Market experience was very informative. I am big into authentic cooking, do not take shortcuts while cooking and her classes definitely met my expectations Her kitchen was extremely clean! Mae would demonstrate the dish then monitor me to make sure I get it exactly like hers. She is passionate about cooking and has great knowledge about ingredients all over the world. She was able to tell me what the ingredients would be called in America and in what state( frozen ) I could find them . Not only was she able to teach a technique but explain the science behind the process. She and her colleagues is very hardworking in order to give you the best experience and knowledge. Authentic techniques, patience, helpful, friendly, generous, motivating and also entertaining haha! Would definitely consider going back to learn more dishes the next time I visit Thailand. If you are looking at this class, do not rethink and go for Mae's classes. She will help you out with proper attention. Do not think about the cost if you find it expensive. I registered for 2 classes back to back and it was definitely worth it. I encourage you to go for her classes and I think she said she used to cook with her grandmother which tells me that her cooking style is very authentic. Definitely a co relation with her grandmother and cooking as far as I can remember. Over all GO FOR IT!. mrt IS RECOMENDED. Taxi driver took us around the world lol plus traffic is bad in the morning. lasts stop in mrt and do not listen to google. you reach the last stop real quick (30 mins compared to 1 hour on google)"

You will start with a market visit where you understand the basic about ingredients ( seems they r using quite a variety of eggplant over there ).once back at the place we prepared 4-5 dishes which were delicious and actually not that difficult to follow.The staff was great, explained everything.Free drinks and we have received the certificate as well.Let's see if I can cook any of this back home .Price was very reasonable 1350 baht"

It doesn't pick you up but also save half the cost some other companies charge. Plus finding the place is part of the adventure. I followed the GPS on my phone. Once you find the Chinese temple, it's very easy to follow the direction. I got the morning class at 9 am which is the best because I went to traditional market and produce is still fresh and abundant. Got to see many things I have never seen before. Got back and start cooking. Accomplished 5 famous Thai dishes and they taste really good!!! Highly recommend the class!"

The instructor was very knowledgeable and professional.Very informative trip to the market to pick up the ingredients. The menu covered most of my favorite thai dishes.The Pad Thai I made was as good as I have tasted here. I feel fully equipped to replicate these dishes when I get home. I now appreciate the importance of flavour components in thai dishes: saltiness, sweetness, sour, creamy and chilli heat; and the balance and hierarchy of these which varies depending on the dish."

We chose the customized-menu class, which was as-advertised with a tuk-tuk ride, market shopping, and a 4-course meal which we each got to prepare at individual cooking stations. Our leader would demo-cook most dishes first and then, after a tasting, she set us free to repeat the dish with tips on how to change the ingredients for different tastes. The class was very well organized and all ingredients appeared at our station at the right time and used dishes cleared away immediately. More than enough food per person by the end.Wish we could go back for a second round.Tips:-Follow website directions to building - entrance is not on the main street and Google Maps would have directed us to the wrong side of the building-Customized-menu class does not mean private (this was fine with us!), but a few others joined our group and cooked the menu we picked out"

As other reviewers mention, the place can be difficult to find and the alley entrance is easy to miss \u2013 pay close attention to the directions. Also, allow yourself the extra travel time if you need car or tuk tuk service. We didn\u2019t plan enough buffer time to get a can and our driver was not familiar with the location, so sadly we missed the market tour portion of our trip.The class itself was wonderful! The instructor and her helper did some of the more tedious prep work and the cleanup (if only we could had this at home). We opted to cook 2 dishes, break to eat, and then cook the remaining 2. We were happy we chose this option \u2013 we were quite hungry by the time we finished the second dish and portions were large, it would have been difficult to eat all in one sitting. The food was amazing and we were able to customize to our individual tastes for spicy/sweet/etc.While we booked a private class because this allowed us to choose the 4 dishes we were most interested in making/eating, it would have been fun to cook with other travelers as well."

Everything was well organized - from the market tour to the snack to the cooking and eating at the very end.Our teacher Mae was very knowledgeable and pleasant and overall awesome. Learned quite a bit even if I'm a newbie in cooking. My fingers are all in tact so I say the whole thing was a success. We learned to cook Pad Thai, Chicken Green Curry, Tom Yum Soup and Mango Sticky rice. I may never have to buy Pad Thai outside ever again (Ok, I kid. Sometimes you're just too lazy to cook).

She could speak English very well.The course started with a visit of a local market where Mae bought ingredients for our dishes. She provided us with many details on local food and habits. We travelled to the market in a TucTuc. Once we got back, she introduced the dishes we were about to cook and we started cooking. The kitchen was clean and well equipped.Mae and her assistant were really professional and really wanted us to have a good time. They prepared the material and the ingredients so that we could focus on cooking. During the break, we could eat our first dish in the classroom (with air-conditioning!), while Mae and her assistant cleaned the kitchen and prepared the second cooking round. We cooked several dishes: chicken emerald, papaya salad, yellow curry paste and chicken, stir fried pork.I would really recommend this school to people who want to have the same great cooking experience as the one I had!"

This trip itself was a gem ! Our instructor was Mea who was wonderful and very informative. Everything we cooked tasted delicious.

My mom and I did two customized half day classes with them and it was a day well spent! Even from the email correspondence with them, I already felt that I was in good hands. Their emails are very professional and clear. The school is a little hard to find so allot extra time going there. Our instructor was Mae. She spoke English well and her instructions are easy to understand. She adjusts her teaching style based on the students as well. At time, we would cook simultaneously but when a dish is something unfamiliar, she'd do a demo first. The outputs we had are also the best dishes we had our entire stay in Bangkok! I'd love to attend her class again in the future! :)"

We chose Maliwan because we wanted to be able to choose the dishes we cooked, as we had already done a cookery course in Chiang Mai and didn't want to cook the same dishes twice. We found the cookery school pretty easily by following the instructions and map provided. Our instructor was Mae who was wonderful, enthusiastic and very informative. The market tour was fascinating and we got to take all the fresh ingredients back to the kitchen to cook with. We used fresh spring roll wrappers that we had just watched being made and made our own coconut cream with coconut we had watched being grated. Everything we cooked looked and tasted delicious. Mae explained and demonstrated everything clearly and also took into consideration that we had already done a cookery class and so didn't focus for too long on things she knew we would have already learnt. Mae's assistant Ju was also friendly and worked really hard getting the kitchen ready for us. We had a very enjoyable day and I am looking forward to cooking the dishes now that I am back in England."

The instructor (Mae was ours), then gave us a few minutes upstairs to rest while she prepped the kitchen. We then were patiently taught how to make the best thai food of our lives! I was especially excited by learning how to get coconut milk from ground coconut meat and hand-grind the ingredients for green curry paste!

My husband and I had our own private class with our chef Mae, who was very nice and knowledgable! Mae took us to the market and thoroughly explained different foods and what they're used for. Then she led us carefully through the cooking: my husband typically does all the cooking, but Mae was so good that I didn't screw anything up (which is a miracle)! The venue was very clean and nice (and air-conditioned for you Westerners). It was a BIT hard to find, but once we did, we were okay. Also, the food we cooked ended up being some of the best we ate on the entire trip. Thank you Mae!!!"

The best part was when we sat down to eat the dishes we cooked, there was pride and satisfaction but I was a little disappointed as my dish was not as tasty as Mae's as I did cut down on the chillies and spices thinking it would be too much to me.

I don't usually write reviews but this lass deserves to be fully booked every single class.When I arrived it turned out I was the only one booked in for the class, but instead of turning me away or asking me to re-book for a different class I received a one-on-one lesson and tour of the market, something that I am sure a lot of companies would not do.I looked at information for every cooking class in the same area and Maliwan had the most appealing menu and lowest price, a very respectable 1250baht for a 4-hour workshop including the market tour, fresh ingredients and 5 dishes to cook and eat.I've been living in Thailand for 4 months and have seen and bought from a lot of markets, and yet I still learned a lot on the trip she took me on.The cooking part of the class was excellent. The ingredients were fresh and everything was very organised and well-prepared. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and Mae (the teacher) was brilliant, showing me chopping techniques and taking everything at a good pace so I wouldn't get lost. She allowed me to cook my dishes exactly as I wanted to, especially when it came to the curry dish where I chose how much meat/potatoes I wished to add and how thick I wanted the sauce.Great location, as the majority of tourists will be familiar with Khao San Road - I was able to get a free bus from my apartment in Nonthaburi, an hour away, result!Overall it was a highly enjoyable afternoon where I learned a lot, ate a lot and didn't break the bank in the process. I will definitely be back to try a different course."

I did the 101 cooking course in October when I was visiting Bangkok.I absolutely loved it!I have to say I did quite a little research before choosing Maliwan and in the end I chose it due to two reasons:1. It was the only Thai cooking school I could find in Bangkok which had not only early morning or evening classes but also afternoon classes which worked perfectly with my schedule.2. It was the only place you didn't have to submit an advance payment and simply sign in for a class. That was perfect for me as I didn't know until a few hours before what day I could actually go.Mae, the instructor is pleasant, a great cook, patient and speaks very good English. The place itself is clean, convenient, very well designed.The classes are very small, which was perfect for me as I needed some teacher's attention asI am a very bad cook....we were only 3 in my group which was great.The trip to the market prior to the class itself is really fun and once you get to eat the meal you cooked yourself - you'd be very proud of yourself.I gave this entire experience 4 starts and not 5 only because it took me a really long time to find the place. It's pretty centrally located but on a back alley in a crowded city like Bangkok I simply couldn't find it without the help of a tourist information center I found close by.Other than that, it's the perfect place to have your Thai cooking experience! I hughly recommend it, just make sure to leave time for getting lost on the way there..."

There were 5 of us in the class with Mae as our instructor. She was very patient and explained everything right from the beginning when we visited the wet market. That was very interesting and we were in awe of the entire experience. After picking up all our ingredients, and answering our numerous questions, we headed back to the kitchen. We each had our own station so we were forced to learn everything, from chopping, grinding, and cooking. The class is supposed to be approximately 4 hours, but according to Mae, we chose some dishes that took longer to make, so we ended up staying 6 hours. We ate after we cooked the first dish and started the second one. Since it had to cool, we went upstairs to eat our first dish, then came back and finished the second and third dish. We ate those two, then went downstairs to cook the last dish, which took some time to make. By the time we ate the last dish, we were stuffed. We actually had to doggie bag food to take back. The portion size each person makes is very generous, and Mae did not try to rush us out at all, even after taking all that time. Luckily, they did not have an afternoon class. I think this was one of the most memorable experiences we had while visiting Bangkok. If you have some time, it's a definite \"MUST\". It was very reasonable, too."

When we arrived at the building we met our instructor, Mae, and sat down for a quick drink before heading to the nearby market. The time spent at the market was very informative. We were instructed on which ingredients to select for the 4 dishes we had chosen, and how to pick the best quality of each. We made sure to ask a lot of questions about the foods being sold by each merchant and get an idea of the types of dishes that they were generally used in. Mae explained everything very thoroughly, and gave us a great sense of how the Thai people shop for their meals. After the market we came back to the \"classroom\" and had another drink to cool off while Mae and her assistant prepped the food. We were given the choice to cook two dishes at a time, and eat in between, or to cook all four at once and eat at the end. We chose to cook all of our dishes and eat at the end. When the food was prepped we went down and began cooking. The instructions from Mae were very easy to follow, and each step was laid out in an organized fashion. After we completed all 4 dishes we went back upstairs to enjoy. As some of the other reviewers said, by the time we finished cooking the first two dishes we made were a bit cold. So if we were do do this again we probably would have chosen to make two dishes, eat them, then make the other two. Needless to say, they were all fantastic! Now, while I'm not completely inept in the kitchen, I'm certainly no Emiril Lagasse, and if I was able to make these dishes come out great, then I would venture to say that anyone could. But don't take my word for it, check it out!"

The set up of Maliwan is pretty good despite it's location (I'd recommend you use Google maps). After introductory drinks we were taken to the wet market (you don't really need old shoes but avoid flipflops or open toe shoes) where Mae, our guide, bought all the fresh ingredients we were going to cook with. This was a great opportunity to see all the different produce the Thai's use and Mae happily explained. Back at the place we then prepared for cooking. Mae was a good teacher; telling us to be guided by our sense of smell to tell whether things are done rather than set times. The menu we cooked was good too but my one criticism would be that we didn't eat our dishes after we cooked them. We waited till the end when the first ones were really cold. Still, a top experience and whetted my appetite to get back and try a Thai Green curry for myself!"

Prep goes into each booking so a cancellation 30 minutes after your supposed to arrive means they have incurred cost. This is an awesome class so get your act together!

It was a wonderful way to see a bit of the city (on the visit to the market), find out a bit more about Thai culture and, of course, learn how to make some great dishes. I cannot recommend it enough. I now feel far more confident in the kitchen!"

A little bit hard to find so look out for the narrow alley way, four garage doors and a tiny sign and you'll be right! If in doubt ask someone local, they all knew where I was meant to be heading. After a quick refreshment we headed to the market by tuktuk. really interesting sourcing the ingredients and learning more about Thai cuisine. We made green curry, tom yum, pad thai and mango sticky rice. Way too much food to eat at once (you break half way through to eat your first 2 dishes), I was able to have my pad thai and mango rice packaged up to take back home to show my very impressed husband."

            "review": "Great small class!. I was really impressed with this cooking school for a couple of reasons. First, the attention to detail is impressive. When you arrive the recipes are printed for you. You cook in a very clean kitchen and as you cook the assistant magically takes away dirty dishes without you knowing and refills your water class before you can blink! Secondly, the class takes you out into the community. You visit multiple vendors to get your ingredients. Finally, the instructors are good teachers! They complete the cooking with you, telling you what to do, showing you how to do it, and then prompting you to try. They also sequence the dishes so your skills build across the class. You become more independent at routine tasks in the kitchen and then they introduce more complex skills. Finally, I was impressed with their flexibility. I was quite late due to traffic and they adjusted the class accordingly. As you are in Bangkok and it is a bit tricky to find, I would leave PLENTY of time. You will want the full four hours!"

            "review": "Delicious and well-balanced cooking course. Maliwan deserves rave reviews. We have some experience with cooking classes in Southeast Asia and still believe that Maliwan is one of the best. As a disclaimer, I will say that there were only two of us in the Thai Favorite Dishes class and so larger groups or different classes may not have the same level of awesomeness in their class. While the format is similar to other cooking classes (market visit, cook, eat, cook, eat), there are several points where Maliwan stands out.1. Stellar catering to vegetarians. As a vegetarian and meaty omnivore couple, we were surprised that we cooked the same menu. Mae (the instructor) provided a range of textured soy products that approximated the meat used-- different products for different dishes. This is unusual as other courses that we did simply left out ingredients for the vegetarians or used the same old Acme-brand tofu bricks. Mae also tasted the vegetarian dishes to make sure they were close enough to meaty originals. 2. The market visit had a more natural feel. Some courses have set stops where one walks to points A, B, and C with a little lecture at each. With Mae, we wandered the market stopping whenever something wriggling or wrinkly caught our eye. It was also fun to see her haggle for various ingredients. She also shared with us a snack that she really enjoyed and it was fun having the guide derive as much pleasure from the snack as we were (chive dumpling with thick soy chili sauce).3. We felt a desire to get the dish right. Other cooking classes seem to demonstrate a dish or cook along the group but without as much sampling back and forth to see if our pinch of fish sauce is really a handful. Mae cooked with us and let us sample different stages of her preparations to give us a benchmark. It was incredibly helpful and much more than simply following a recipe.4. Photos! Mae took photos of us as we cooked in class and later sent us a link where we could download the images for free. It was such a treat to have photos of us cooking together in class as well as capturing those frustrating moments when tying a money bag seems impossible with fat fingers.5. The whole meal was delicious. We made money bags, red chili paste, panaeng curry, cashew chicken, and minced meat salad. As a set and as individual dishes, each were superb. We know that the cooking class dishes are often good but we found these to be particularly delicious. We believe that one aspect might be Mae's precise approach to adding ingredients in a specific order to ensure that the flavors blend well. We highly recommend this class to anyone from beginner (the vegetarian) to seasoned (the meaty omnivore)."

I have been to another cooking school in Bangkok before so I will list the Pros & Cons of Maliwan over the other school.First the Pros.Our instructor was Mae, she was lovely and cute! Very patient and knowledgeable.The market trip was much better, we went to a nearby local wet market by Tuk Tuk. it was a great market, it was an event itself.The school interior was more modern and fully air-conditioned. The student to teacher ratio was smaller therefore felt more one on one. There were only three students on my date. The environment of the school itself was comfortable and quiet.The Cons.The food after cooking did not looked or taste as great.( this might be due to user problem or the ratio of ingredients prepared by the staff was not balanced).If you don't have any experience in chopping stuff or cooking, you might not experience the whole learning process as you will play catch up a lot as the pace is quite fast.Lastly, the location is nowhere near any BTS or MRT so you have to Cab there.Overall, it's a great class and I will recommend it for any groups or individuals as any cooking lesson in Bangkok is never boring! It's great fun!!So what are you waiting for?? Go! Go! Go!!!!!!!!!"

It was all very hands-on and the results were delicious (we ate as we went). We had done a fair bit of Thai-style cooking already at home, but we still learnt a lot of new techniques, and all of it easily repeatable. Mae's English was excellent, and much of the pleasure was just getting to know her and learn a bit more about the Thai way-of-life. All the staff had a great sense of humour. The class was a bit cheaper than some of the others we read about, but I couldn't have asked for a better experience. We were even able to choose which dishes we wanted to cook. Highly recommended."

It was our first time in BKK and we had the regular stuff planned : sight-seeing and shopping. Due to a good review in the Inflight magazine, we learned about the option of doing a cooking class and figured, why not?We were so glad that we did!REGISTERING FOR THE CLASS. It was very easy to book our class online. Among the different cooking classes offered, only Maliwan offered the chance to \"customize\" our lesson. There were different images on the website with descriptions which helped us pick what we wanted. I was a little disappointed that we could not pick different menus, but i understood that since we had only signed up the day before, 2 out of the 3 instructors were scheduled to be out of the kitchen that day. This being the case, we were asked if it would be alright to just stick to 4 menus. FINDING THE PLACE. The directions were most helpful, but because the entrance to the class is in a small alley, it took us awhile to figure it out. Based on the directions, after finding Kraisi road (which isn't that difficult), you have to keep your eyes open for a SMALL CHINESE temple to your left. Because there is a BIG Buddhist temple ACROSS the street, and because the Chinese temple isn't very obvious right away ... we passed the small alley without seeing it. The key is that you won't even cross to the end of Kraisi Road to reach Sipsamhang road ... it's RIGHT after the small Chinese temple to your left. You enter a small alley and follow the rest of their directions ... its not far from there :) ...Then we had the MARKET TOUR which was so much fun. My husband and i were lucky in that we were the only students registered for that class that day :) ... we got to ask our lovely host Mae all our questions which she patiently and enthusiastically answered. We even got a bonus of seeing the old lady who makes FRESH lumpia wrapper! It was one of the highlights of this experience.Then the COOKING EXPERIENCE. My husband and i enjoy cooking. Though we aren't chefs, we aren't novices in the kitchen. But what made the experience worth it was the way Mae (and her assistant Ja) would explain all the different spices and nuances with Thai cuisine. We each had our own work station, so we could go at our own pace. The ingredients were set out in a very organized manner which helped our work. We did a lot of the preparation from scratch which also made it very interesting.My husband and I were so glad that we capped our BKK experience with the Maliwan Thai Cooking Class. I am pretty sure that if we were ever to visit BKK again, this is something that we would do all over again :)."

Their guidance is really good and they are happy to give general tips and ideas how to prepare Thai dishes at home by substituting some ingredients.Probably the best thing about this cooking class is that you can choose the dishes, this was the main reason we picked it. They have a variety of options to choose from during your booking (via web, very convenient).The trip to the market is also fun and informative, you can learn about all the strange fruits and vegs you might have already seen in Thailand.Not only the cooking was enjoyable, but the end result was some of the best Thai food we have tried.Before you go there print out the map they send you with instructions for the taxi drivers in Thai. It is very close to Khaosan Rd and finding the place is not difficult, just read the map carefully."

It was a fun and relaxed cooking class, with wonderful tasting food cooked by my friends and I. The trip to the market was interesting and insightful to their culture and the instructors Mae and Dha was friendly and accommodating. It was an intimate class, with a very well equipped and clean kitchen with organised instructors and assistants. Plus, the printed recipes for us to take home are easy to follow and understand. The pictures of us cooking was a definite bonus to culminate the experience."

I've learned to cook Pad Thai, Green chicken curry, Tom Yum soup, and mango sticky rice. We started from exploring outdoor market for buying ingredients. Khun Mae gave us full of explanation on how the raw ingredients are used in thai cuisine. While we are cooking, she also explained each steps of procedures with culinary knowledge. If you like cooking and thai food, and are willing to learn more about thailand, this class is highly recommendable."

We booked a custom class and learnt to cook pad thai, yellow curry, spring rolls and coconut chicken soup. We were lucky enough to be the only two in the class which led to a very personal experience. The market tour was informative and useful for understanding all the ingredients. The class was hands on the whole time with each of us cooking our own Serving of the dish. The food was delicious and straight forward enough to know we will cook it again back home. Highly recommend this class, but go with an empty stomach, there is alot of food!"

This course is suitable for everyone, beginners, intermediate or advanced cooks.The dishes tasted so nice you could think they came straight from a restaurant, hell, I think some were even better than what I had from time to time! :) We did pad thai, green curry chicken, coconut mango sticky rice and tom yum goong.The market visit where you buy some of the recipe's ingredients is nice as well, she explains what the thai chefs use for which dishes and so on, good thai ingredients-lesson right there.Overall just 5*, I paid 1500Baht, some pay 2000Baht, I wouldve paid 2000 with joy as well, well worth the few coins."

Love all those things, and I have to admit--with her guidance the two of us did FANTASTIC! Very tasty, good restaurant quality! The market visit was amazing also. I don't usually use this many superlatives in a review, but the class was great. Lots of time-savers too, she had helpers doing things like shredding fresh coconut for us after we gave it a go. Good thing too, that takes time! Although the taste between fresh, homemade coconut milk and canned is HUGE, so we might actually have to do the fresh thing at home sometime. They also took pictures & put them up on a private link afterwards. **We also went during the height of Songkran, and that was fun, although we got drenched on the way to the market & back. Bring extra clothes in a dry bag! and COME HUNGRY--we did & still couldn't eat it all. Great value for the money."

They were more than happy to answer our questions. We then ventured back and cooked four beautiful classic thai dishes. They tasted incredible and all so very filling. The class was small, which enabled us to get the help we needed. The girls continued giving us pointers along the way. At the end the girls gave us a certificate and the recipes we cooked that day.

We cooked so much food that I couldn't possibly eat it all, but I especially loved the Kai Phad Bai Kaprao (Stir Fried Chicken) and Kaeng Phed Ped Yang (Red Duck Curry). The girls were just the nicest people in Bangkok (everyone we met in Bangkok was friendly so that says a lot). We went an hour and a half overtime, but the staff were determined to help us finish all the recipes, never complained once and never once lost their smile. They even quickly surprised us with a free Thai sweet tea drink (Cha ma now) which my girlfriend and I were talking to them about in the morning and was something they did just for us out of kindness. Just a wonderful introduction to the sights, smells and taste of Bangkok after we got off the plane (which thankfully wasn't late). For the price they ask for, it's a steal and I actually felt bad that I didn't pay more or do any washing up. Thanks girls, you were all beautiful! I'll be attempting the stir fried chicken this week!"

Maybe some people will find it too easy or not challenging enough, but I think foundations are important. Having knowledge and awareness of some of the herbs, spices, and other ingredients used in Thai cooking is a great way to discover how Thai dishes always have this amazing balance of sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and sometimes spicy.We were given recipe cards to try to recreate the dishes at home, as well as photos of our time in class. Thank you very much once again to June, Chef Puu, and everyone at Baipai Thai Cooking School. I would like to attend another class in the future, perhaps one with a dessert included.

After Baipai, I try to sneak in a cooking class every time that I travel to a new country (although Baipai is by far the best class that I have ever done). It's a great way to learn more about food and culture. While I was interning in Bangkok in 2008, I went to Baipai once on my own and once with my mother while she was visiting. Both trips were wonderful. The open-air kitchen is absolutely beautiful and the cook and interpreter were lots of fun and very helpful. I love that they show you how it's done and then let you cook your own meal. They really have the entire process down to an art. I use the recipes that I learned all the time, and I even grow Thai eggplants, basil, and peppers on my balcony in New York City now! Also, I bought one of the aprons and love it. It's really good quality and still in great condition all these years later."

An excellent experience from the moment we arrived to the final mouth full. June and her chef Puu were fabulous hostesses and excellent tutors. I loved being able to see every move and then be able to have a go myself. The food was excellent and the company equally good. A thoroughly pleasurable experience. An added bonus was the photos that arrived on my phone before I got back to my hotel a really nice touch. Thank you Bai Pai for a great trip - I have no hesitation in recommending this activity."

They even got my fussy eating 13 year old to try curry, flavouring & exotic foods. Can't recommend it strongly enough, in fact we want Puu to come to Chiang Mai with us to cook for the next 4 days!

The cooking by seeing is also very easy and they take the time to tell you everything and how to do.There are also a few girls which work in the background and do everything that you have a smooth cooking experience. (while you are eating the first dish they already provide the increditents for the second dish)Also nice: They provide a driver for you! Just ask for the pickup (which is included in the price) and they tell you which hotels are possible. If your hotel isn`t in the area no problem - just go to the next hotel they drive to and wait in the lobby. Easy!Every cooking, every dish and for sure the pictures you will get (from yourself while cooking) are great ... next time i`ve been in bangkok i will come again and learn more from Noi!"

Within the first few days of our trip, we escaped from the hectic traffic and the never-ending shopping that Bangkok is renowned for, to a pleasantly relaxing yet spicey cooking session at Bapai Thai cooking school.

Staff, notably foodie experts, then transferred us to the school kitchen for a fun - filled lesson preparing a 3 course menu. Chef Puu shared Thai gourmet secrets with us and June's sense of humour certainly didn't go unnoticed! The end product said it all and I most certainly would do it again on a next BKK trip."

We only had 2 days (actually more like 40 hours) in Bangkok, before heading off to Koi Samui for an island break.  When my wife found out I had booked half a day in a cooking class, she was not impressed. She felt that given our limited time, we should be out exploring the city. However I convinced her stick with it, as it had been highly recommended by a friend. The friendly driver picked us up from the hotel at 0845, and we had the usual exciting Bangkok driving experience. The school was quite far from the hotel, and the traffic was pretty heavy. Still got there on time, and the final drive through winding lane ways was fascinating. When you arrive at this little island of paradise amongst the city sprawl, it really takes your breath away.  The entire cooking experience was a joy, from beginning to end. Warmly greeted, we sat around a table with a relatively small group and each introduced ourselves. Our host, June, was charming and warm, getting some laughs right off the bat. Issued with our 'Masterchef' aprons and obligatory waist towel, we were then led down to the beautiful garden for a series of informational talks. Starting with the touch/taste/smell of herbs and plants used in Thai cooking is genius. It's a casual way to meet the group, and sensitises you to the tastes and flavours of Thai cooking.  The actual kitchen and cooking experience was fantastic - perfect blend of Thai countryside character and high quality equipment and facilities. For each meal on our four course menu, we would first gather around the main teaching table where Chef Puu would demonstrate. She is clearly a professional, but made sure to bring us all along on the journey, explaining everything. We would also prepare our own sauces and ingredients here. When ready to cook, we were each dispatched back to our own cooking station to prepare our meal. The chef and host would dart around making sure we each managed to keep up with the recipes, some of which were surprisingly complex. Everything worked perfectly. And the meals were divine. Best of all, between each course a quiet crew of cleaners would sweep through, sorting everything away and preparing everything for the next section. Could do with that at home! Anyway, my wife had a huge smile on her face the entire time, and we both took loads of photos (but no video!). Start to finish it was a great experience, and we both decided it was a great way to spend some of our limited time in Bangkok. Will definitely return in future."

I would recommend this cooking school for anyone who likes Thai food even if you do not cook well or at all.The school starts with a tour of the Ot To Kor Market. This market provides a great overview of the types of food you can use in Thai cooking. If you are in a place that has cookin g facilities you may want to return here for fresh food to prepare.The cooking school is well laid out with a grow pare to observe the chefs prepare the dishes and then individual cooking stations to allow each student to try to match the chef's creation. Lots of help for the rookies. My wife was scheduled to cook with me but had to cancel at the last minute. Although we could not get a refund they prepared a full meal for her to take back to the hotel.The dishes I prepared were; stir fried Chicken with cashew nuts, spicy grilled beef salad and stir fried rice noodle thai style (Pad Thai).The school can handle three groups in separate areas (prob about 20 per group)Great day"

And Thai is one of my favourite foods so decided to take this class based on reviews.Booked online and reservations were sent promptly. There are different cooking choices based on what day you attend. And a follow up email confirming attendance and pick up time.Did the market tour first. Very interest to see all the raw ingredients. Made it easier when shopping later on one own.We were given small treats and water will in the market.We were then taken to the cooking school.My menu was the hot and sour prawn soup,pork parcels and green Thai curry.The prawn soup I have had in Bangkok on my first day and I did not like it at all so wasn't looking forward to making it in the class. But surprisingly it tasted 100% better . The trick was if the soup is left out too long it becomes very sour. So fresh soup is more tasty. It's now my favourite dish.I don't eat pork and they replace mine with chicken so very accommodating. Tasted amazing.Green Thai Curry was made from scratch. And the process was very tedious but enjoyable. My curry tasted amazing. No oil was used as well.I really enjoyed this class and would go further to say this is a must do.Warning when using a mortar and pestle don't look down into the mortar, one of the guest got chill in her eyes not a pretty site.The cooking teacher Pyo was amazing. Spoke clear English and was very funny. Thanks to her I had a very enjoyable class.I have returned home and have made the green curry and it's amazing, the taste was reproducible. Ingredients wasn't easy to find but I managed."

They were so friendly and accommodating to me and my mother and sister.

My mom got overheated at one point (Thailand in May is HOT) and they took care of her, bringing her water and setting up a fan to make her more comfortable. At the end they drove us to a location different from our hotel, which they did not need to do at all.The facility itself is gorgeous. Its spa meets island bungalow meets Thai cooking school. All of the cooking is outdoors. The bathrooms are clean. The cooking locations are similar to a Benihana with the chef in the middle demonstrating and the students sitting around in a semi-circle. All of the ingredients were pre-portioned out for you and after you were finished with each step, staff members cleaned up your station extremely quickly.The food was delicious. We made three courses: fried pork dumplings, Tom Yum soup with shrimp, and green curry chicken. The demonstrations were well done and easy to follow and everyone had their own work space.The staff at the end gave us all little magnets with a photo of us cooking printed out inside and followed up a day or two later with an email attaching all the additional photos they took of us throughout the day.I highly recommend this cooking school.

She even suggested appropriate substitutions in case we were unable to find the ingredients at home. The actual class takes place in a beautiful kitchen setting where you first observe the head Chef prepare the recipe and taste her version. Then you take your ingredients and cook your own recipes. The first half of the class we made Chicken in Pandanus leaves appetizer and a Green Papaya Salad. You then take a break and enjoy your creation. The second half of the class we made Red Curry Paste and then used the Red Curry Paste to make Pork Coconut Curry. You then sit and enjoy your curry meal with the rest of your classmates. I would definitely do this again when we come back. The recipes vary from morning to afternoon classes."

We were picked up from our hotel in a mini-bus and met others who had booked for the day. 2 couples had been before and were returning for another lesson, and another 4 had already been to other cooking schools, so we were the beginners!First stop was a fabulous market - complete with sparkling white tiled floor. Not what we were used to in Thai markets, but huge and completely fascinating. We were shown around with great explanations on many ingredients. We bought some fresh ingredients to cook for the day.Then off to the Cooking School. Firstly we were struck with how beautiful the Thai house and water garden were, and also with how professionally the whole experience had been planned. We all sat around a central kitchen, where we were shown how to do things. We then practiced, before heading over to our individual kitchen stations.My husband who had refused to go initially, - and only came kicking and screaming - was totally absorbed and loved it. The girls (chefs) have great fun and a super sense of humour and the luncheon we cooked was sublime!You could buy beers, wine and soft drinks for the lunch.We're going back at Christmas with friends, and this is definitely on the itinerary again!Oh... and all the others who had done cooking schools in Bangkok before, told us that this was by FAR the best. They had initially recommended others, but then told us not to bother after experiencing this one."

On arrival you are greeted with a drink and then shown around the garden to see what some of the fresh ingredients in Thai cooking look like. I found this really helpful as I did not know some of these herbs and spices. You are also shown the traditional method of making coconut cream and then you are introduced to the spicy, sour, salty and sweet aspect of Thai cuisine with a tasting session of different flavours e.g. tamarind paste etc. After that, its on with the cooking. You are provided with step by step recipes for the dishes you make. They also have a small souvenir shop. Perhaps management should think about selling some of the ingredients used in the cooking class. You are given a fridge magnet with a photo of you as a gift and the rest of the photos they took are emailed to you.Thank you again to the staff at Baipai Thai Cooking School for two wonderful experiences."

We chose to meet our host June at the local market before heading to the school to cook our 3 dishes with our chef, Noi. I cannot speak highly enough of this experience! June made us feel so welcome and was so enthusiastic as she took us round the market. Once at the school she and Noi made the class so much fun! Apart from the friendly staff, it is also clean and the school and its surroundings are just beautiful. A free shuttle service is provided from the city (we could not avail ourselves of this as we were staying further out, but we were given clear instructions about where to meet); cold drinking water, tea and coffee are available throughout the class; aprons and hand towels are provided; there is a lovely area to wash your hands; you are given a little folder with the recipes inside and a souvenir photo fridge magnet at the end; and the food we prepared was just delicious. We loved how Noi demonstrated, then we tasted before we set about cooking our own. Bai Pai Thai Cooking School is a must do for everyone visiting Bangkok. 10 out of 10! :)"

The shuttle was air conditioned and it made one other stop to collect other members of that day's class.Our guide then took us to a local market where we got an education on the ingredients that go into Thai dishes. We walked around the market and sampled different items and then we were off to the cooking school.The ladies who taught the class were excellent. They were friendly and really engaging with the entire group. They equally shared their time with the cooking pairs and carefully guided us through the basics of preparing certain Thai dishes.We prepared 3 different dishes and they all came out lovely. The presentation was excellent and the taste was everything I expected from Thai food. We also met some wonderful people from different countries in our class and that also made the experience at Baipai one of my best memories of Bangkok.I certainly recommend Baipai Thai Cooking School!"

This school not only provides excellent cooking classes but you learn about the herbs/vegetables used in Thai recipes, seeing some of these growing and you learn about the flavors of Thai foods and how to get the various flavors of Salty, Sour, Sweet and Spicy. Then you start cooking - watching the chef explain the dishes as she makes them and then doing them yourself. Of course, you not only taste the dishes the chef makes but you get to eat the ones you make. The food was absolutely delicious and we brought home doggy bags! As you are participating, they take pictures which are sent to you after your visit. Shuttle service is provided from selected hotels. Definitely a highlight of our visit to Bangkok. Noi, our chef and June, her colleague were great guides and we look forward to testing our new skills upon returning home."

We started with a discussion of the different types of herbs and ingredients that are Thai staples. They then showed us how to make coconut cream and coconut milk. From here we moved in to the open air kitchen to start our lesson. We started with one of our favorites .....spring rolls. We also made the dipping sauce for them which was excellent! From spring rolls we made a pork larb salad. This too was excellent. Next up was my all time favorite......Tom Ka Gai. Again......excellent. We finished up with a minced pork and rice noodle dish which was also excellent. June and Song were very helpful and assisted each person to insure that they were preparing the dishes properly. They also broke each dish down into simple steps that were quick and easy to follow. I will definitely try the spring rolls, larb and Tom Ka Gai when I get home.They also attended to all the details from taking photos to printing recipe cards! All in all......I would highly recommend Baipai Thai cooking school to anyone who wants to learn to quickly and easily make a few Thai dishes on their own!"

June and the assistants constantly walked around as you cooked, making sure you were doing everything correctly. The food itself was amazing - fresh ingredients, and was so happy to do this early in our trip, as the rest of the trip we could recognize the ingredients and know what they were.

Transportation was in a small (appx 15 passenger) motor coach. Upon arrival, lockers are provided for personal belongings. Our class started with our assistant chef who took us around the beautiful and immaculate property to show us the various herbs and vegetables we would be using to create our dishes. Our class consisted of preparing several courses including appetizers (papaya salad and fried chicken thighs) main course (red curry with pork) and mango sticky rice for dessert. Directions are provided by the chef and assistant chef to groups of 10-15 at a time so the experience was very hands on and intimate. The cooking facilities were open air and immaculate. The property was beautiful with foliage, water and many lanai areas. Our entire experience was fantastic. The one thing that caught many (including us) off guard was at the end of the class we were told the driver would not be dropping us back at our hotel due to traffic. Instead we would be dropped at the BTS station. The BTS ride back to sukhumvit was inexpensive (appx 40 baht) and the BTS was extremely clean, cool and fast. We think it was a much more enjoyable experience than sitting in a warm motor coach for a long drive back."

The two girls who led the cooking demo were brilliant and had such good humour. We ate together at the end and enjoyed the food! Delicious. Such good value for money.

This activity is all included: transfer from and to hotel, drinks and snacks at the market and ingredients to cook with, back at the school. You get to eat what you make. For some of my co-students, this proved to much as we made 3 different dishes in the 1/2 day class.

            "review": "Amazing cooking school. I booked a cooking school at Baipai and was not disappointed. I had booked the transfer to the school, which was a clean, minibus with air conditioning that arrived on time. Once at the school I was greeted with a welcome drink and then taken on a tour. This included learning about the local ingredients that were grown and the common tastes of thai cooking. The class itself was great. I am a fussy eater and only eat chicken, which they provided me for each dish (even though others cooked with beef and prawns). The facilities were great and the chef was easy to follow. There were also lots of people to help with the cooking. Overall I made four amazing dishes and enjoyed my day in Bangkok. I would definitely recommend this cooking school."

June our Hostess is adorable, Funny and very helpful. Song the chef is so sweet and patient . The food we cooked is what you always order from the Thai menu and it is great to learn how to cook it. Everything about Baipai is amazing I strongly recommend it."

I received free air conditioned transfers to and from this hidden leafy secret, and on arrival I was taken away with how beautiful and spatious the grounds are. This cooking school looks like a five star resort or restaurant! We were welcomed with Thai iced tea, then taken around the grounds to have staple herbs/fruits/vegetables in our recipes shown and explained. Fone was incredibly knowledgeable and patient when explaining all the key ingredients and Thai cooking philosophy. Chef Noi showed us how to make coconut cream and milk from scratch. All in all, we made four courses (cashew chicken, Thai beef salad, pad Thai and for dessert ruby water chestnuts in ice coconut). Chef Noi and Fone are absolute professionals, with the support staff impressive (how did they clean and set up without us noticing?!). To remember this great half day experience, Fone took pictures the entire time and emailed them to us within hours. Thankyou so much, I will definitely be back."

            "review": "one of the best activities we did in Bangkok.. First off, I really liked that this place was very quiet and soothing.The BaiPai cooking school was like a traditional Thai-style house with a little garden.They picked us up from our hotel and return to some tourist spot where we wanted to go. Since we had to get up early for attending the class, the shuttle service was very convenient.We started market tour with Apple, she explained the ingredients and gave us tastings then we were transferred to the cooking school. The class was informative and fun and the facilities was clean as well. We cooked 3 dishes (Pad-Thai noodle, Stir-fry chicken with cashews and Beef salad in Thai-style) and got to eat them all. Apple took pictures of us throughout the class and sent to us via email afterwards.FYI, there's no air conditioning which usually is no problem, but when you cook on hot summer days.. it's uncomfortable to me. One of our classmate shared her experience in the other cooking school and she said that Baipai's Pat Thai is taste better than the other but that the other one have more dished to cook like 5 and gave mango sticky rice as a souvenir after the class. It's small and noisy with lots of people in a class though, as she said both have their pros and cons.I would recommend this activity to anyone who is thinking of trying something different, and if you love Thai food, then give this a go."

The cooking class is in a beautiful traditional Thai home which is very welcoming and soothing. They even take pictures throughout the class and send to you via email afterwards.

They picked us up and return from the hotel with no fuss or problem.nin total there were 8of us, my husband and I booked this through Viatour before we travelled, which has proven to be excellent during our trip in Thailand. However two of the group had booked the night before- so worth a call the night before to try and get on the course! The experience involved us looking closing at some traditional Thai herbs and fruits that they grow here in the garden. Once we did this Apple our assistant for the day introduced us to chef Noi, who between the two of them were very funny, entertaining and put you at ease. I am no perfect cook, and this seemed excellent for those who are confident and less confident at cooking. The demonstrations were easy to follow and then Apple and Noi were at hand to talk you through as you tried. Such new ingredients meant that even an experienced Cook would be trying something new i'm sure, but a novice would feel out of their depth.Well worth a go- highly recommended!"

The team is so kind and fun; they really take care of you. They prepare everything (ingredients/cookware) and it's so organized and in an adorable location. They help you as you're cooking so it's not stressful at all, but you still do most of the preparation and cooking yourself. Also before cooking they walk you through all the ingredients you're going to use in the garden, which is really interesting. There's even a super convenient shuttle service and they email you pictures from your day afterward. I really recommend this as a great way to spend a half day in Bangkok. It's more original than sightseeing, it's hands-on, it's delicious, and it's a really good price for what you're getting. The chefs and especially Apple are amazing and so sweet. Everything was perfect and I can't wait to start making Thai food from scratch at home."

The instructor was very nice but made a comment regarding how Thai people prefer the skin of the blond German girl who was taking the class with me rather than my brown skin which was very offensive. I understand it may be Thai culture, but those opinions need to be kept to herself especially when I'm paying for this service."

I am Thai so was not expecting to learn anything new during the class but I must say even for a local the classes are good fun and pretty informative. We started off learning about the various ingredients and condiments used in Thai cuisine and then went on to cook 4 dishes. The instructors were very friendly and clear and the classes were structured nicely with a break in between each course for us to enjoy our own dishes. The school is located in a relatively remote area of Bangkok but the shuttle bus made it easy to get to and the traditional Thai house added to the charm of the experience. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in Thai cooking. I have found a new love for Tom Kha Gai as well!"

They score high on amenities and venue - from the hotel pick-up, to the welcome drink, to the beautiful venue and learning area, the nice aprons, and nice recipe cards. However, it ends there. The recipes that were presented were far from authentic. When I raised a valid question on the used of an ingredient, I sense some irritation on the part of the instructor, on which she did not give a convincing reply. The the least, this class might be for tourists with zero cooking skills, and would just like a touristy rather than an educational experience."

We received aprons and recipe packets and Noi, our cooking teacher, demonstrated the techniques before we tried the recipes ourselves. The careful step by step instructions were well paced and clear. I think we all felt successful, from the more experienced cooks to beginners in the group. We enjoyed the delicious results as well as the company of new friends on a beautiful teak open air veranda . I think I want to skip some other scheduled activity to come back again before I leave!

            "review": "Best Cooking School in Thailand!. Had my third visit to Baipai yesterday. After taking cooking classes from a number of other places, I must say that Baipai is the best cooking school in Thailand. Chef Marsh and Fone are professionals, their love of Thai food and cooking comes through, and you truly learn how to make the food to be able to re-create the dishes at home. The class made red curry and everyone made their own curry paste. In a previous class, we made Pad Thai the original way. Each time I have learned great cooking techniques.The school is set in beautiful Thai house with gardens, the instructions for each dish are clear, and you are helped to make wonderful food. Highly recommend the school!"

The setting was stunning and the building was both stylish and well kitted out for cooking. The course was brilliantly structured and planned out. We had our own recipe cards to annontate and keep. No more than 10-12 in a group which worked beautifully. We made 4 varied dishes and to be honest these were the best dishes we ate all holiday. The staff were very knowledgable and helpful. They took photos which were then emailed to us the following day and they even gave us a fridge magnet with one of our photos on it. A free transfer back to our hotel finished off our day. We learnt so much about Thai cookery and it has inspired us to do other cookery courses while travelling and at home... We just hope they are all this good!"

While chef Pu is stirring her wok we all get a good view in the overhead mirror!When we've finished our dish we sit down to savour it. They have a cheerful and efficient team.I certainly recommend the Baipai experience.Only inconvenience really is the distance. From our hotel the Centara Grand It took us about half an hour ."

The location is just fantastic as it is a really original place in the middle of Bangkok. The facilities where great and the team was very processional as they teach us things you normally never learn in a cooking school like how to make your own coconut cream etc and tamarind paste. So I can only thank the chef and the Bai Pai school for the cool experience and dedicated time to me and my colleagues. By the way something cool was the transpiration as they picks up what was great as Bangkok is really big."

Went to Baipai Cooking School for a team outing with my colleagues from the office and it was great.They picked us up from Asoke in a mini van and took us to the school. Being located 20 minutes from the city, its the perfect place to relax and escape busy Bangkok while learning to cook.Staff is super friendly and the school itself is beautiful. Green lush garden, wooden furniture and small ponds with fish made us realise that there's more to Bangkok than shopping malls and food courts. We were received by K. Apple who together with our chef showed us the organic garden with different thai vegetables, and how to open a coconut and make coconut cream and milk from it. Then we started with the food.As im vegan, they created a special option for me even though i was the only one from the group. I basically prepared the same dishes using tofu and avoiding fish sauce. I was worried as many schools actually cater for vegetarians but not many for vegans due to shrimp on curry pastes. Teacher/chef were amazing and their level of english was incredible as they studied abroad.After 4 dishes we sat down for a beer before the driver took us back to Asok BTS station.Definitely a great place to learn thai cooking, with great people and more importantly, great food.Completely worth it and recommendable!"

This time I elected to go to the market, which Apple took a group of us through, all very much enjoying our exposure to dried ingredients, fresh seafood, fresh fruits, spices, posing coconut flesh to create coconut cream and milk. We also sampled various items made from melons and other fruits that were lovely. Afterwards we were finally ready to head off for our cooking experience. Today we prepare chicken with Cashew Nuts, Spicy Thai Beef Salad, and Phad Thai. Chef Puu assisted by Home made our class quite enjoyable, both were keen to know which team members I'd cooked with last year and were certainly happy to have a returning customer. We had a full class, bigger than my first class, yet the chef and assistant easily managed keeping all students on pace when we hit the burners to ensure we all proceed meals that were going to look good and taste wonderful. Again, as with last year, thoroughly recommend Baipai as an experience when visiting Bangkok."

Everything about the experience is top-notch. The school itself is beautiful. The photos online look good, but don't do justice to how lovely it really is. The cooking stations are professional, yet fit perfectly with the decor of everything else. I felt like I was on a set for Top Chef, but without the panel of judges telling me that I suck. Our instructors were excellent. They spoke very good English and were able to explain all the ingredients and techniques we were learning in great detail. First, the instructor would run through all the ingredients, what each one brings to the dish, and then she'd demonstrate the preparation and cooking process. They have an angled mirror above her cooking station, so you can easily see a top down view of what she's doing. This was extremely helpful to be able to understand what's really going on. Then we'd taste her dish, and we'd replicate the process, with helpful reminders and tips from the instructors along the way. At the end of the day, I had prepared four dishes that were actually really good, and I think I can replicate them at home. I've been struggling with Thai cooking for a long time, so this is a huge achievement! I wholeheartedly recommend Baipai school, and if I ever return to Bangkok I'm going to set aside several days for classes."

Having read the negative reviews on here I think they are way off the mark and have gone with the wrong motive... We thoroughly enjoyed our day so much so we purchased all the additional recipe guides to try at home, Apple has since emailed photos and offered her help with any of the menus when we return home should we be struggling with any of the recipes. It's not a Thai cooking school it is a fantastic snapshot of how Thai cuisine is prepared and put together with a fantastic tasting result..

We had a very knowledgable chef, well capable of answering our various questions and were supervised closely enough to turn out some stunning food.Our group contained a pro chef and I'm a very keen homecook, food blogger and former Masterchef contestant we both got lots out of the session, as did some who claimed to never cook at home.

Everything was shown to us by them before we attemted doing it ourselves on our own dedicated kichen \"island\". The kitchen itself was very nice! This is cooking for everybody, both those who have not done much cooking at all, and for those that are new to Thai cooking. We learned how to make 4 different dishes, and of course we got to eat them all. No need to bring anything, but i would reccomend some comfortable shoes. You can also buy some equipment after the class if you wish.We also received a mail with photos the following day, a very nice gesture!All in all a very nice experience that we will remember!

Booking is very easy and you get to see their schedule & planned dishes online. You then email them. Upon confirmation, they will also pick you up at your hotel at no extra cost. We chose Friday morning session which included a market visit, golden bag appetizer, tom yum shrimp soup, green curry paste and green curry chicken.The driver came exactly on time to pick us up and we traveled in a comfortable, air conditioned mini van that also had seat belts. We were then dropped at the Or Tor Kor Market which is considered one of the best fresh market in Bangkok (very clean and easy to visit compare). We were then explained bu our guide Chompooh the different ingredients (who speaks excellent English and a few words of French) and we had a nice visit. Since there were only 3 of us (including my husband and I), it also felt like a private tour. They are very considerate also, since I told them that I was afraid of frogs dead or alive, they made sure to tell me where it was and we did not go. We learned and saw many interesting things. For instance, we were shown the difference between coconut cream and coconut milk. The guide also purchased a traditional snack and drink for us.Or Tor Kor Market is great and directly at Kamphaeng Phet metro station, it is also right across the Chatuchak week-end market (some stalls open during the week days). The guide asked us if we wanted to purchase anything but we indicated that we preferred to come back afterwards since we wanted to see it a bit more in details. We were then driven to the school. Honestly it'S a good thing that they come pick you up, it's somewhere in the suburb and you turn left, then right, then.... Impossible to remember how to get there. Anyway, we then entered the premise of the school which is a superb villa with a pond and a small bridge. The pictures do describe the place well and it's just such a beautiful place.The instructions were very good and easy to follow, you even have a mirror on top to see the way the chef cooks. He prepares the dish for you first and then you get to taste it. You then \"prepare\" your own ingredients. Honestly, you don't really prepare they do the hard work for you (everything is wash, peeled, cleaned, etc.) and you just have to enjoy the little bit of cutting and ponding the puk puk left. Everything is so fresh and they keep their ingredients in the fridge until the last moment. The dishes were all so good and so fresh. Best meal in Bangkok for sure and that includes the 150$/person sunday brunch at the Mandarin Oriental. Our pictures were also taken and sent to us in the afternoon for our souvenir. we got to keep the recipes and were offered with a picture of each of us. We were then driven back to the location of our choice (we went back to the market).I think this school is one of the most expensive ones at 2000 bahts/person but we found it to be so worthwhile, we wanted to be around some quiet and lush surroundings and this place just met everyone of our expectations. We both highly enjoyed it. Highly recommended!Funny thing, their pond has frogs.... One of them came on the grass but since it's a big yard and I was in the house it was ok... lol.. Our guide who knew I was scared of frogs made a face like \"no it's not a frog, you didn't see that\"... like I said I was fine since it was quite far away from me but I guess some people would find that charming."

I visited this school during a weekday in January for a private class with 9 other work colleagues, after deciding on this venue on the strength of other Tripadvisor reviews. Our team consisted of people who had rarely cooked anything (the majority) to those who cooked on a regular basis, and the staff were able to accommodate our diversity, poor humour and general lack of cooking competence with constant smiles and laughter.We were the only people at the school for our visit, and this further added to the sense of tranquillity imparted by the gardens surrounding the kitchens. Aside from the banging of our granite mortar and pestle as we ground ingredients, we felt from the silence we could have been in the countryside of Thailand rather than a suburb only 30 minutes drive from Sukhumvit Rd. The initial introduction to the Thai herbs we would be cooking with on our arrival was an excellent way to set the scene for the rest of the day. I would highly recommend this activity to anyone looking for something different to do with work colleagues that imparts useful skills, whilst allowing everyone to have fun. My gratitude and that of my colleagues goes out to the team at Baipai."

If I ever visit Bangkok again, another class at Baipai Thai Cooking School will be top of my agenda!"

I liked the demonstrations. Everything was clean and professional. The lemongrass tea is to die for ! Well worth the money. It is more a guided cooking tour as everything is prepped for you but the dishes were wonderful and portion size was good. Recipes come in a lovely pack to take home. 5 stat for location, cleanliness, food and friendliness ! Excellent English I had a great experience ! Loved it !"

This was the activity I was most looking forward to when travelling to Bangkok, to learn Thai cooking, and it most certainly did not disappoint, I had a fantastic time. We started off with an introduction to the herbs that go into Thai cooking, with an opportunity to smell each, and get a basic understanding of each. Next we progressed to understanding the process of creating coconut cream and milk from coconuts, rather than from a supermarket can; we even had an opportunity to scrape coconut flesh from the coconut using 'the rabbit'.The menu you prepare depends upon the day, today we made mango sticky rice, red curry paste for our red curry with pork and bamboo, papaya salad, and chicken pandanus leaves. There was no assumption of skill, and a lot of joviality made for such a fun learning environment, if you struggled the chef or assistant help you get there, and eventually you manage it yourself.I cannot recommend more highly you do thus if in Bangkok, you will enjoy yourself very much, and a sense of accomplishment as you eat the food you prepare. You also get a cookbook with the days recipes!!"

I first attended the cooking school in December 2012 and had a blast. I also attended September 2014 over 2 consecutive days and felt very welcome as they had recognized me from 2 years ago. Yes they take you to their garden and pass lemon grass around for you to touch and smell, chilli, kaffa lime leaves, basil and everything else that is involved in Thai cooking. They also inform you as to what herbs and spices work best in stir fries, curries and soups. I love that they have kept the demonstration on how to make coconut milk and cream from a fresh coconut and not from the tin.I also like the new edition of understanding the sweet, sour and salty combination in Thai cooking. Showing what soy sauces to use and what dishes, when to use palm sugar and when to use normal sugar.The staff are extremely friendly, the facilitates are extremely clean, the food is lovely and fresh and they have catered for the less experienced cook to someone who cooks all the time and just enjoys cooking. If you don't want to cook Thai from a bottle ever again and surprise your friends by cooking Thai from scratch then I highly recommend going and having some fun."

I would love to go again and learn some more. We got to eat our finished products and they were delicious! A great way to spend some time. We all just loved it! They are very considerate at the school. A friend had a severe coconut allergy and all precautions were made and when someone forgot something after class the pick up bus brought it to our hotel the next day. We even got emails with photos taken by our instructors. Truly a great experience with some lovely Thai people."

Thai holy basil is different from traditional western basil, not everyone is familiar with fresh tamarind or with making coconut milk and coconut cream. It was extremely helpful to have so much of the prep done for us before we arrived so that we could focus on the actually complexity of the cooking. I did not fly half way around the world to learn how to mince pork or dice carrots, and the advance prep allowed us to focus on cooking and on spices. I think that some of the students who wrote earlier reviews were extremely wrong headed; after the mincing and dicing and slicing, the interesting part of Thai cooking is the assembly. Staff was helpful, I learned how to make a couple of dishes exactly as I want them, and we all had a great time."

I attending an afternoon cooking class with my husband in early April, and if it weren't for the fact I attended my best friend's wedding during our Thailand trip, this would have been the number 1 experience.We were collected from our hotel right on time and taken to the beautiful and traditional Thai house in the suburbs. We received a warm welcome and a cup of cold lemongrass tea from Chompooh, and had some time to meet and chat with fellow attendees.We were then taken around the gardens, with common Thai ingredients explained as we went. We were shown how coconut milk and cream were made and even had a go ourselves.After that we were shown around the kitchen, and the tuition from Chef Noi began. There were seven of us in total so it all felt pretty intimate, plus there is a big mirror over the hob so you can see exactly what's going on, and none of it seemed rushed, you could really take in what you were being taught.Each individual station was immaculately clean and spacious, and everything was easy to follow -even for my husband who doesn't venture into the kitchen much! Chef Noi and Chompooh should have a TV show - the make a hilarious duo! The whole thing felt very relaxed and calm, and above all, the dishes we made were wonderful! I've made everything we learnt twice since being home for a few weeks, and will continue to make them, along with the other recipes that we bought from the little shop after we'd finished.All in all it was an incredible experience. It started off as something I was 'dragging' my husband to, but he was blown away by it, as was I! Beautiful surroundings, amazing company, and fantastic food which is easy to recreate. It would be ideal for couples, families, and solo travellers alike and I can't recommend it enough."

The two guys who teach you to cook are really funny and made what I thought was going to be boring into a really fun experience. They take you step by step and cook first what you will make and then you get to go try to recreate it. Sometimes after you try to cook it, it looks great and sometimes you just sort of get close.

            "review": "First class in every way. Although I grew up in Thailand and know what most Thai dishes should taste like, I never got around to learning how to cook them properly. I wanted to learn the \"tricks of the trade\" which is what brought me to Baipai - an appropriate name, too, since \"baipai\" means \"paddle.\" My first impression was one of astonished wonder. I hadn't paid attention to the Tripadvisor photos so I was pleasantly surprised to arrive at the beautiful Thai style compound that houses the school. (The place exudes a cheery peacefulness and is well worth a visit in itself.) If first impressions mean anything, the refined, sensible decor told me I had come to the right place, which as I soon found out, I had. The chef's aide, Chompoo, took us on a tour of the garden where she showed us fresh herbs and how to use them; we were also shown how to make coconut cream and milk ( I took five different classes and got to meet the other equally talented and professional chef and sous-chef teams.) Everything is perfectly timed so that you are able to enjoy the cooking process and the food as well as a few dashes of humor from the chef and learn a maximum of skills,too. As for me, my wish had come true: I got to learn things like when and how to use the cream and the milk of the coconut (two somewhat different things); when to stir or not to stir a dish; how to keep the color of a cut eggplant from turning; how to make your own curry pastes, and so on. The best part was when I finally found out how to make one of my favorite dishes, \"yum woon sen\" or \"glass noodle salad\": although the one I (used to) cook tasted OK, it was always chewy and somewhat hard to digest until I learned that the key is to... oh well, you'll have to find that out for yourself, now, won't you!"

The starting conditions were good: We love the aroma-intense and fresh Thai kitchen, we really enjoy cooking (however usually only on weekends or special occasions) and we recognize high quality and professionalism. We got it all.Experienced and travelled Chef Poo with her sweet sidekick Apple (no joke) were a perfect team. It was great fun to watch them explaining the secrets of Thai cooking (eg. separate the coconut cream from the milk) and to try it afterwards ourselves. The cooking lounge itself opens to the beautiful garden with all the necessary herbs we got an introduction to in the beginning. The class is perfectly organized, in a profi setup and with all tools pre-arranged. So it was fun and easy to follow their hands-on advice and get a feeling for the use of different ingredients, herbs and spices. However, we have to admit that our own-cooked dishes still have room for improvement, in particular compared to Chef Poos very tasty signature dishes. But with the nice little cookbook summarizing all dishes of the class we will continue practicing back home. Thanks for a wonderful morning in your beautiful garden!Inge & Sascha, Germany"

The recipies are simple but tasty, which I find is an advantage if you actually intend to try them at home. I imagine it's not too interesting if you're a seasoned chef or if you've taken other Thai cooking classes before, but as a beginner (and working mom with very little time to cook) I think it's ideal. The place works like a perfectly oiled machine: while you stir-fry someone is silently cleaning up the work station that you've just used to chop, while you chop again, someone else is washing your wok and another person is filling up your glass of water! The chef and the assistant chef were very friendly and helpful (even though at times I felt like their jokes were rehearsed) and the location is superb. I loved the visit to the herb patch where I learned quite a lot about Thai herbs and spices. Thank you for a great time!"

Before travelling to Thailand my wife, 2 friends and I had decided that learning how to cook authentic Thai food would be a great activity to do. We found Baipai and were trying to decide between this and the Blue Elephant cooking school, in the end we selected Baipai cooking school. We were picked up from our hotel at 8.00 to travel to the cooking school which is set in a beautiful garden setting where Thai ingredients are grown. At first glance it looks like a Spa retreat with lots of wooden features and a koi carp pond. We met Cookie and Chef Phu upon arrival and were given some delicious lemon tea and our aprons for the day. We then were lead around the garden firstly being shown how coconut milk is extracted from a coconut as well as being shown Chilli\u2019s, Lemongrass and Galangal all growing fresh in the Baipai garden. After having a sensory overload with the smells and tastes of the ingredients we were lead to the \u2018kitchen\u2019 which was a vast open aired classroom. We had pre-selected the dishes to cook and Chef Phu would cook each dish explaining each step of the recipe and the ingredients used. Most of the preparation was done before our eyes when each dish was complete we got the pleasure to eat it. Then it was our turn. Firstly each of us had to prepare our dishes so slicing and cutting plus lots of pestle and mortar bashing, followed by cooking at the wok with Chef Phu and Cookie on hand to assist us. As my wife is vegetarian, she was provided with substitutes for the meat for her so all were happy! It was a fantastic experience that was so well ran. Cookie and Chef Phu really made our day full of fun! Cookie took photos throughout the half-day session and then emailed them to us, which was great as these were action shots. At the end of the day we were given a small printout of one particular photo mounted within a magnet as a souvenir which was a great touch. Having just the four of us on this lesson made the experience all the more enjoyable. I cannot recommend Baipai cooking school enough, it was simply brilliant!"

I now know to remove from the heat before adding lime juice and how to make curry pastes and to cook up a very passable Green Curry. The trip there in the comp bus was an education in itself and showed a lot of the real city often from the tiniest side streets. The teaching and advice has advanced my knowledge of the cuisine hugely. It all added up to make for a truly memorable morning and one I would highly recommend to any visitor to Bangkok."

You are taken to the farmer's market first, not only to give you an idea of where the ingredients are purchased, but more so to immerse you into the daily experience of Thailand. Amidst all of the stands of fresh produce....fruit, seafood, meats, vegetables, candies....there are stations of fresh cooked foods. It was the Vegetarian Festival and we all feasted on a few bowls of crazy, tasty corn fritters and sea weed and.....????The cooking school is in the suburbs set amidst outdoor Thai buildings surrounded by typical Thai lush landscaping and lazy ponds with lily pads, all lending to the sense, \"Just relax!\" The staff were delightfully funny, amazingly helpful, and just so right for the cooking adventure. Among our group of 9 international travelers was a restaurant owner and wife from Australia, two college girls from Hong Kong, and the 5 of us from the Georgia/Mississippi.

The cooking school is in a house on the outskirts of Bangkok and has a large and beautifully crafted garden. The beginning of the cooking class starts with a tour through the herb gardens and an introduction to some of the ingredients you will use during the lessons. The lessons themselves are conducted in a large open plan kitchen with each person getting a work station. The teachers were engaging and relaxed, demonstrating each meal in a jovial and sometimes hilarious style. The meals you prepare are all quite simple, but great if you have never done any thai cooking before (which I had not). Each lesson is accompanied by recipe cards, which you can take home and which provide you with simple easy to follow instructions. After you manage to prepare each of the meals you then have the opportunity to sit down and sample your (sometimes) great cooking achievements, they will even provide you with a cold singha to accompany the meal. Overall a great way to spend half a day in Bangkok and certainly a good introduction to Thai cooking, well worth a trip."

Accompanying family who are experienced cooks and who have eaten quite a bit of Thai food, I wasn't sure how our morning at BaiPai would be but based on a friend's recommendation, we booked in, having selected the Thai dishes we wanted to cook. A real bonus is that included in the price is transport to and from the school - perfect for visitors to Bangkok especially.The school is located in a newly built Thai style house, with beautiful Thai pavillion, in a lovely garden that show cases the herbs and vegetables used in Thai cooking.The kitchen areas are very well appointed, with comfortable seating and a good view of the cook demonstrating the dish before you cook it yourself - each person having their own work station, equipment and ingredients.The cook and assistant were delightful, explained well what they were doing, about the ingredients and engaged well with the students, varying their approach for the teenagers in our group.We so enjoyed cooking our own versions of the dishes, and of course eating them too (having tasted the cook's demonstration version beforehand so we knew what we were trying to achieve).Unlike some cooking schools in Bangkok, we were pretty hands-on, did some cutting of ingredients ourselves, and could get the full experience of making our Thai dishes.Overall, it was a delightul and interesting morning whether one lives in Bankgok or is visiting briefly. We all got a lot out of the cooking class and loved the well-designed school. Little touches like offering a cooling lemon grass drink on arrival to giving us each a fridge magnet with a photo of us in action cooking helped to make it a wonderful experience. Congratulations to BaiPai for their hard work and imagination!"

We went on the morning session, being picked up by the school from our hotel and whisked into the suburbs of Bangkok with two other pairs. An Aussie couple and a couple of lovely ladies from Taiwan. When we arrived we were greeted by Jut our soux chef and general helper, his English was perfect and cracked a few jokes to put everyone at ease. We wondered around the garden first being introduced to the herbs and spices before being introduced to our chef Puu. Just like Jut a well spoken, funny and excellent chef who had us all smiling and looking forward to getting stuck into a bit of cooking. If you're a novice or a professional chef I recon you'd have fun on this morning or afternoon. We cooked, stir fried chicken and cashew nuts, Pad Thai, spicy beef salad and water chestnut in coconut milk for pudding. Puu cooks first and we try it... Yummy!! Then we're all sent to our respective stations and copy what we've just seen... It's surprisingly easy if you do what you're told and walk away with a real understanding of how to cook Thai and what ingredients you need. You are given a little booklet so you can do it all at home and get the chance to buy some souvenirs if that's your bag?! All in all a great experience and definitely worth doing whatever your ability. The team there are incredibly friendly and fun and keep you smiling the whole time, there are pictures taken for you so you don't have to worry about that and are e-mailed to you. You are dropped off at your hotel or wherever else you may want to go and above all you eat everything you cook so you won't need lunch... I suggest if you're going in the morning session you don't eat breakfast either... we did and were stuffed by the end!"

Very tranquil in a beautiful lush green setting right in the heart of Bangkok. Our chef was March, brilliantly assisted by Jit. The two of them were great fun & the demonstrations were both interesting & amusing as the two of them cracked jokes as they went along.We made chicken & cashew nuts, spicy thai beef salad & pad thai. Each course was demonstrated at the main demonstration table which was superbly set up with a slanted mirror above the chef so you could see exactly what was happening. After tasting the chef's dish we then got to go to our own cooking islands & give it a go ourselves. March & Jit wandered amongst us, giving tips & then we got to eat each course before starting the next one which was a great idea as not only did it mean nothing was having to be kept warm but we got to have a little break before the next dish.We thoroughly enjoyed our morning & it was a lovely, & very filling activity! The souvenir photo fridge magnet & recipe wallet was a nice touch to remember it by.Would most certainly recommend baipai cookery school & will hopefully be able to do another course the next time I'm in Bangkok. Excellent value for money & both interesting & fun.\"Aroy mak mak\" as they say in Thailand! (Very yummy!)"

My daughter made the reservations on line and we were picked up at our hotel. In the morning we visited the fabulous market and were able to shop. Then we arrived at the school and were amazed at the peaceful gardens. The class was very organized and staff were wonderful, spoke excellent English. The teaching methods blended didactic, observation, hands on and practice. The chef was outstanding and encouraged the most novice students, that would be me! I highly recommend the Baipai Thai Cooking School. One of the other students said she had tried another class at the elephant school but felt the Baipai Thai school was much better.The best part is having the recipes to take home and the wonderful souvenir magnet."

Everything is prepped for you and ready to go and all you have to do is read your little recipe cards after the demo and make it work! Reservations were made online and they also pick you up and drop you off at your hotel! You also have an option to do a Market Tour at one of the upscale wet markets in Bangkok! The whole experience at BaiPai was painless and enjoyable! At the end of your cooking class, you will also receive a cute little magnet of yourself cooking! Kudos to the wonderful staff!"

I contacted several, however the folks at Baipai were quick to respond and excited to answer all my questions. I had been in Bangkok on business so attended the school on the day I checked out of my downtown hotel and transferred to the Hilton. The Baipai folks provided transportation, so they picked me up in the morning at the Novotel then when done took me to the Hilton boat launch. Cant ask for better service than that. My class began with a trip to the fresh market. What a fantastic opportunity. I watched fresh coconut cream being squeezed from coconuts, shrimp paste being made and tasted more fresh fruit than I thought was possible. We then went to the class where I linked up with my classmates from Hong Kong and the USA. Pooh was our instructor and she was fantastic! After her excellent instruction we would make a course then sit down and enjoy it. You could purchase Thai beer or Thai Tea to go with your creation. After each course we would make another and do it all over. It was an open air facility and beautiful in all aspects. It was a wonderful way to spend a half a day in Bangkok."

In was picked up at my hotel and taken to the tranquil surroundings where the school is set. This was about 30 minutes from Sukhumvit (in good traffic). Our group was only six in total and after a walk through the the herb garden with Jit we were introduced to Noi, our chef and instructor . We did the Set A menu which was Pumpkin in Coconut Milk, Chicken with Cashew Nuts, Tom Yum Goong and Green Chicken Curry both made from scratch. Amongst the laughs and after Noi showing how it was done we all got to cook our own individual dishes. All very easy with maximum flavour. we all then ate our dishes in the beautiful setting washed down with a cold beer. After which we were dropped back at our hotels. A very reasonably priced way to learn how the Thais cook. Highly recommended ."

The cooking school arranged pick-up services at our hotel which was so convenient for us.The environment inside the cooking school is comfortable and relaxing. We got introduced to the common kinds of herbs which are available in many thai cuisine and got the chance to use a traditional mahcine to peel off the coconut meat.The cooking school prepared the ingredients and everything was in a right portion and sequence. Everyone in the class managed to cook after seeing the chef demonstrated once. The flow of the class was good, the chef cooked the cuisine first as demonstration. Later, we went back to our cooking station and did our cooking part. Therefore, it is not difficult to cook the yummy cuisine.The chef and the staff were nice and helpful. It was really an interesting experience, I would try other cooking sessions in the cooking school if I come to Bangkok again."

In fact it was the highlight of our holiday. This is the second time we have visited and when we next go back to Bangkok we will definitely be going again. The chefs (Noi and Jot) make it a fun and educational experience and I have definitely now acquired a taste for Thai food. We were picked up from our hotel and taken to the beautiful school in an authentic Thai house. We collected the herbs that we would require from the herb garden and then proceeded to start on our 3 course memo. You can adapt the food to your own taste. The first course was eaten downstairs and the main (Thai red curry) and sweet (banana in coconut cream) was eaten upstairs in the dining room. During the cooking session many photos were taken which were then emailed back to me in Australia. We were also given photos of us on fridge magnets. I highly recommend a visit you will not regret it."

A friend and I attended a morning cooking class that began with a trip to the market to purchase the ingredients that we would be using for our cooking class. This was a wonderful learning experience and helped to orientate us to food shopping in Bangkok. The service and instruction at Baipai was incredible. From pick up at the hotel through to drop off, this experience was nothing but professional. The location of Baipai Cooking School reminded me more of a sanctuary than a cooking school. Our instructor was incredibly knowledgeable about Thai cooking and spoke great English. She made everyone feel comfortable and relaxed during our time together. She was attentive to dietary needs and the levels of heat people could tolerate and helped us to modify the dishes we were preparing based on this. We prepared three entrees during our class using the fresh ingredients we had purchased at the market earlier in the day. We ate our final entree upstairs together in a restaurant-style fashion. At the end of the class we received our graduation gifts which were included a personalized photo magnet which had a photograph of each of us cooking during the morning. Baipai Cooking School was a wonderful experience and well worth the money. I would recommend that you purchase an apron and take it home with you as a souvenir and smile when staff take the many photographs throughout your cooking class as these are emailed to you following your class and make a lasting reminder of a wonderful day."

We were presented with a small folder of recipes and made the desert first. She showed us how to cut, cook and present the dish. We then went to our cooking staion (in pairs) and made the dish which we ate after finishing. This routine was repeated with every dish we made. I thoroughly enjoyed the day and would recommend it.

The English was great and the recipes were yummy. If you're any kind of semi-experienced home cook, it may move a bit slow for you.

The driver picked us up from our hotel at 12:50pm and delivered us to the cooking school located in a quiet suburban area, a little tropical oasis with a beautiful 2 storey Thai building, which was very well designed and laid out. They conduct morning and afternoon cooking classes run by typocally beautiful Thai ladies, kind, sweet and helpful. First you get an interactive tour of their herb gardens which includes making coconut cream & milk. Every class has 4 courses with different combinations every day - choose the one you want from their website. Each course starts around the chef's bench with a demonstration, questions/answers and tasting. Then it's to your own cooking station with the menu to have a go yourself under their supervision. After each course you sit by the pond and enjoy your cooking. The final course, the mains, once cooked is taken upstairs to enjoy in their dining area overlooking the garden. Their drivers then are you back to your hotel, we returned at 5:45pm thanks to the typical Bangkok peak hour traffic. We both thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at this school, it was very relaxed, informative, enjoyable and funny. Our only regret was that we did this on our last day in Bangkok, we just wished we had more time to enjoy another cooking class. I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending this to anyone who loves food and wants to spend 5 hours having fun."

You get a mini cookbook and a pen to take notes while they teach you. I have yet to make anything but I plan on trying some things that we learned.You cook 3-4 things and after each item, you take a break and enjoy eating what you made and interact with the other people who are also taking the class. I believe the class size is only 8-10 people so it's very intimate and gives you a chance to meet people who are visiting from other countries. We met people from Australia, Colombia and other places so it was really cool!After the final recipe, they take you upstairs to the dining area so you can really relax and enjoy your food.They surprised us with a little souvenir which was a photo magnet of you cooking which was really sweet! Those 2 magnets are still on our fridge and everytime I see that magnet, it makes me want to go back and experience the cooking class all over again!Lastly, they have a little gift shop where we ended up buying a couple of things. We got a knife and a mortar pestle (the thing they use to mash guacamole/spices in). I thought the mortar pestle would look cute in our kitchen but the best buy was definitely the knife. It was only $8-10 and is hands down the best knife I've ever used. A knife like that here would be well over $50. So if you don't buy anything else, make sure to buy their knife!! I didn't have any issues bringing that back on my flight. Just make sure you put it in your check-in bag and not the carry on.Hope you enjoy the cooking class as much as we did!! :D"

We learnt a lot from the demonstrations and cooked 4 courses of wonderful food - Classes are about 12 people or so, and everyone has their own work station. We cannot praise it highly enough, and will do another course next time we're in Bangkok."

Well designed facilities with nice style created a wonderful atmosphere. We picked set \"D\" as the one we'd most likely cook at home. From beginning to end, our cook and her sous chef/describer offered clear explanations as they demonstrated techniques. Watch, do; watch, do; watch, do, eat, and so on. Nice pace between recipes also afforded opportunities to chat with fellow chef wannabes. Over the course of four hours, we cooked, learned, and dined. Yes it was a little warm, but they kept our water glasses topped up at all times, and in the end we concluded it was an excellent, relaxing and fulfilling (experience and stomach-wise) way to spend an afternoon in Bangkok. One couple with us returned for their second course -- that says bundles. If only we had more time...."

The staff are friendly and helpful and the setting is in a garden that makes you feel very relaxed and at home. You learn about the herbs and spices you will be cooking with and are then shown a demonstration of how to cook your dish and then after you cook yours you get to sit down after each dish and eat it.

The booking arrangements, class confirmation, collection from the hotel and the trip to the markets all went well; and was relaxing given the humidity and bustle of Bangkok. The cooking school is set in a beautiful garden and the kitchens are open, lots of cool ceiling fans and a very pleasant environment. The classes may be more suited to a novice, but a reasonably experinced home cook can still pick up a few useful hints. The staff are very pleasant, and all have good english. This cooking school is something I would recommend for a break from the shopping malls and markets of Bangkok."

My partner and I got told before we left Melbourne that we must do a cooking class at Baipai, so we booked with our travel agent to make sure we didn't miss out as we weren't going to be in Bangkok for very long. It was a such a good experience with a lovely mixture of people in the class (from Australia, Hong Kong, Italy, Brunei) all keen to learn a thing or two. It was a fun and informative session, with hands on cooking and clear demonstrations. The food was delicious and has inspired us to do more Thai cooking at home instead of just getting Thai take-away! The cooking school has beautiful gardens where they grow some of their own ingredients. It was interesting to see how some of these looked before harvesting. We all went home with a photo fridge magnet and recipes from the session. They also pick you up from your hotel and drop you off afterwards, which was very convenient as we would never have found the place by ourselves. All in all it was money well spent. Thank you to Chef Noi and assistant Natalie for making it such an enjoyable day."

We had actually chosen another cooking school, but since they were fully booked we ended up with Baipai. And afterwards we were very lucky we did (see last summer's review). So, this year we decided to repeat the experience and chose another menu and instead of going in the morning and also taking in the market, we opted for an afternoon class. We learned to cook other dishes as a result. And we again enjoyed doing this class tremendously. Baipai is a very well organized school. The atmosphere is great. The teachers are very knowledgeable and experienced. With a great sense of humor. My husband who is diabetic and the fact that he cannot have sugar in his food was always taken into account. Even though it is a bit pricey, it is money well spent and we'd certainly do it again anytime. Thank you Baipai !"

I was short on time in Bangkok so I chose this school as they offered a half day course and collection/drop off from the Hotel was included in the price (a good thing too, as I would never have found it otherwise,). The course cost me 2200 baht as I was alone, although the price would have been around 2000 baht per person had I been part of a group. The school is not far from the city centre, but it feels a world away and is very peaceful. The location is set up as a formal school in a modern wood/concrete house with kitchens that open onto gardens and ponds. The teaching itself is straight forward and follows a set formula - you are issued with a booklet containing 4 recipes and you proceed to work through each in turn, led by a chef/teacher with an assistant. Whilst you are watching the demonstrations by the Chef, an army of assistants hustle in the background to prepare your workstation with everything that you will need. In this respect I do not think that this school would suit an experienced cook as much of the work is done for you (you are given just enough of each ingredient to make the required dish - pre-washed, peeled etc). Obviously you get to eat whatever you cook, and it is a great chance to chat to your fellow students. Most importantly though, the food that we cooked actually tasted really great. Overall - a really fun and informative experience."

This time we thought we would try something a bit different and since we love Thai food a cooking class seemed like a good idea so we checked out the options on Trip Advisor and went with the Baipai. This has to be one of the best things we have ever done in Bangkok, the experience alone was great and the chef and other staff were humorous, informative and more than happy to answer any questions along the way. The food we consumed throughout the day was even better! It was a great way to learn by seeing how it was done and then getting the opportunity to make our own which surprisingly turned out pretty good. We have tucked our recipes away to keep them safe and will look forward to having a go at cooking them again as soon as we get home.

We were served with a cooling lemongrass tea immediately.The class began promptly after everyone arrived and started a tour around the garden and was introduced some of the commonly used herbs in Thai food. Everybody had their own stations and was given a glass of iced water throughout the class.The demonstrations were quite clear and I had no problem following the instructions. We even cooked our own lunch!The only little complaint I would have is that everything was pre-cut and didn't take part too much, but I guess the focus was on the cooking technique and it was more of an introduction to thai cooking.I would recommend this class to you if you are keen on Thai food and cooking."

We originally had our third day in Bangkok as a free day, but twice in the 2 previous days we had run into people who had taken a cooking course at Bai Pai cooking school and raved about it. So we arranged it through our hotel to attend the morning session. We were picked up at the hotel around 8am and we drove to other area hotels to pick up other class participants. The school is located outside of the city, about a 30ish minute drive. We arrived at the school and we were greeted by Mona, who would be our group leader for the day along with our chef, Noi. The place is stunning. Open air, but well ventilated, so not too hot. It really looks like the set of a cooking show on the the food network! We were given cold towels and a cup of cold lemongrass tea and explanations of how the morning would proceed. We started with a tour of the gardens and were shown many of the ingredients we would be cooking with. After that we learned how to make fresh coconut milk and coconut cream. Anyone who wanted could have a go at grating the fresh coconut. Simple and easy. Then we moved to the kitchens to prepare the days menu. Homemade green curry with chicken, chicken pandanus, egg custard and papaya salad. It was an amazing hands on learning experience. Both Mona and Noi were amazing, a real comedy duo, who were always helpful and offering good tips. Ice water was constantly being refilled and we took regular breaks to eat the food we had just prepared. Somewhere after the 2nd dish, my husband and I decided that we were having such a great time, we wanted to stay for the afternoon course as well! On that menu, spring rolls, masaman curry, pomelo salad and chicken holy basil stir fry. We asked Mona if there was availability, and she arranged it in just a few minutes, no problems, no fuss. The morning course ended and they informed us that we all Passed and handed out refrigerator magnets with action shots of us cooking throughout the day. Nice touch! Onto the afternoon session, it was us and 4 others, small and cozy! We had Nat as our leader and I cannot remember the chefs name, but he was great as well! Afternoon session was just as great and we ended up getting along really well with the other participants, so much that we all decided to go on a day trip the next day together!! At the end of the day, we ended up buying 4 of the knives used in the course, plus several beers and our grand total for 2 of us, whole day of cooking instruction, plus round trip transfers was about 8000 Baht. Astounding value for money! And truly an awesome. Awesome day. This is a MUST if you are a foodie or just love to cook. Appropriate for any level of skill!! DO IT!!"

Arrived to cooking school and site was beautiful and breath taking. It was like paradise. Love the way the school was set-up and how it flowed. The teacher cooks the dish and you taste test then you cook your own dish and then you eat your own dish. Every student has their own cooking station so you don't have to worry about eating someone else's food. Only did one cooking class but would return. Great experience.

            "review": "Had to do this when we were in Thailand. This was our second visit to Bangkok. This time we had spent some in Chiang Mai before returning to Bangkok for four days. As had done most of the 'usual' sightseeing trips in Bangkok before, we thought we would include a cookery school this time. The trip was arranged with our tour guide, but if I look at the cookery school website, I could have booked directly. I enjoy cooking, so the trip was mostly at my behest, but my wife came along as well.We were collected from our hotel and taken to the school - it seemed like a 20 minute ride.When we arrived at the gates and they opened, I was truly surprised at what I saw. The school itself is in its own grounds and is like an oasis of peace inside a bustling city.Although there were quite a few students attending the session - all seeming to arrrive at once in a number of minibuses - we were split into smaller groups and that was pretty much the last we saw of them until we ate lunch.Each group was split into six, each group had a guide and a cook. After a bowl of lemongrass tea (fantastic), we were shown around the gardens to see all the herbs and spices growing before we went to the openair classroom / kitchen.Cookie (our english speaking guide) talked us through the processes and each group had its own english speaking cookery instructor. We had a number of demonstrations on how to cook an element of the meal, then we each had a cooking station where we would do the process for ourselves.In the end, we prepared a four course meal, which we ate partly in our smaller cooking group (the soup and satays) and the main course and the dessert we ate as a large group.It was a really well organised session, well worth the money and helped me produce some great tasting Thai food. We each ended up with a recipe pack and some fridge magnets with our photos. What was a nice touch they emailed us photos they had taken during the session. At the end of it all, we were taken back to our hotel or dropped at the shops - whatever we selected.It was a great session, really enjoyed. Even my wife enjoyed it - and she was not that keen when I suggested we should book in the first place"

While not inexpensive by Thai standards (@$60), it was worth every penny. The fee provided door to door taxi, a welcome beverage, three delightful hours of cooking demonstration, practice and \"taste testing\" and a final meal of the four courses you have prepared, all amonst conversation with new friends. The facilities are clean, open air, the instructions are easy to follow and the teacher and hostess are so delightful you'll want to take them home as your private chef!. There's an eye to safety too, they were very responsive when I got chili pepper juice in my eye. Fun day - I highly recommend it. (Traveled in Oct 2010 - never got around to reviewing...)"

All in all, this was an amazing two days where professional staff made your day run so smooth and enjoyable. Both days, I didn't have to think about lunch or dinner as you eat everything you make. Highly recommend this to thai food lovers who want to learn to cook this amazing cuisine. You will be surprised how easy it is too cook amazing thai food in your own home.

We were promptly picked up at our hotel and driven to the school, wow, how beautiful, the grounds building, furnishings were impressive. We were greeted by our host who took us upstairs where we had a welcome drink and learnt what we would be doing. We were given a tour of the grounds and introduced to their herb garden and taught how to make coconut milk and cream. Next we were taken where we met the chef, who was assisted by our host who spoke great english translated. We made a dessert and then were joined by a larger group where we sat around a large table with ingredients where each dish was demonstrated to us. We moved over to individual work stations where we prepared our dish. The children were more than accomodated and encouraged by the host and the chef, cooking the same dishes as the adults. At the end of each dish, the area was promptly cleaned and restocked with ingredients for the next course. At the end of the courses we all ate our prepared dishes together. I would say that we as a family had a fantastic day and enjoyed every bit of it. We were hesitant about taking the children but they enjoyed it just as much as we did, it was very hands on and the children coped very well. I would highly recommend this cooking school to people of all ages, we as a family learnt a lot, (even that I was making our Thai curries completely wrong) and I can see us as a family cooking the meals that we learnt at home. Thank you for a wonderful day"

            "review": "Fabulous food you can cook at home. We have been to Baipai Cooking School on 2 occasions, both times with our niece aged 12, then 14. She was the only kid on the course but they treated her well and she was old enough and mature enough to do everything the adults did, cooking her own meals at her own cooking station and absolutely loved it enough to do it a second time when we visited again. Kids who are not prepared to be a part of the class would not be welcome as there is nowhere for them to go off and play.Having said that, the food they teach you to cook is fabulous. It is Royal Thai cooking, not village style. It is very hands on - you watch the chef and taste, then cook it again yourself and eat it. There is a translator to assist with English if the chef can't make themselves fully understood. We always do 2 courses in the one day - very tiring, but you go away with 8 recipes. We find you have too much food to eat. They will give you takeaway boxes if you ask.Everything is very well done and planned - all your ingredients are premeasured, but you have to do the chop chop yourself. You do no washing up. They are very insistent on cleanliness and ask you to wash your hands very often.The setting is lovely, they pick you up from your hotel or apartment (usually takes about 45 minutes from the Silom area of Bangkok). We have done a few cooking schools in Cambodia and Vietnam. BaiPai is by far the most professional in every way - could not recommend them enough - having said that - it is not the cheapest cooking school you could find, if budget is important."

            "review": "Great experience. Technically, I can't say Baipai is the best Thai cooking school because it's the only Thai cooking school I've ever attended. However, based on my experience during one morning class, I can say that it would be really hard for other cooking schools to surpass the Baipai experience. The setting is beautiful and the staff pay attention to the little details from the moment you get on the shuttle bus. It reminds me of a four or five-star hotel.Now, I just read some of the previous reviews, specifically those critical of Baipai. My conclusion is that different folks have different strokes. Whereas one reviewer might perceive the experience to be well-organized, another might consider it to be manufactured. Whereas one might enjoy walking through the garden and learning about the various herbs, another might consider this to be condescending. Whereas one reviewer might consider a chef assistant to be enthusiastic, another might consider her patronizing. Whereas one person might consider prepared portions to be efficient and helpful, another might consider it too easy. You get the point.So I guess it boils down to what you are hoping to gain from the class, your budget, and your current experience level. If you want something down and dirty (not literally), Baipai might not be your cup of tea. But if you are someone like me with limited cooking experience and a penchant for new experiences in beautiful settings, then Baipai may be well worth a visit."

We had a great afternoon learning to cook these Thai dishes and of course Chef Noi made it look so easy. The surrounds of Baipai are also very lovely and peaceful to learn to cook and eat the food you have just prepared. They have thought of everything and are very organised. I would highly recommend this cooking school to everyone.Chef Noi first cooks the dish and allows you to taste the dish so you know how it should taste, then its off to your work stations to cook it yourself. Chef Noi also explains if you cannot find certain ingredients in your own country, what alternate ingredients can be used. Everything is cut and prepared for you, all you have to do is slice and dice and pound in the mortar and pestal, then cook the meal. There is also another lady working in the background who cleans up after you and then prepares your workstation for the next meal. Baipai also pick you up from your hotel and drop you back afterwards, they have lockers with keys if you need to lock you bag away.. Very very organised, thanks for a great day, cant wait to try these dishes in my own kitchen.."

I went for a half-day in the morning, including the trip to the market, which is an essential part of the information available at this school. People who missed that were not up on ingredients as much, and getting the correct ingredients is key. The recipes we did included Satay and Pad Thai - yes, perhaps a bit lame in that these are the most well known, so I felt that they weren't giving away any great secrets to Thai cooking, but perhaps there are more to be found in a multi-day class. Nonetheless, the experience was excellent. On-time pickup in nice van, drive out to the morning market across from JJ market, then to the house, which, when revealed behind the tall gate, is simply gorgeous! Lovely garden, house, well organized kitchen, bathrooms, lockers, everything needed. The staff was particularly good and knowledgeable, and they spoke English well and taught with enthusiasm and good humor. The kitchen for students was fine except for the very dull knives they put out (more dangerous than a sharp knife as the saying goes..) The Pad Thai I cooked was one of the best I tasted of this ubiquitous dish. A tour through the garden was also very informative about the ingredients used in Thai cooking. So, all in all, a great way to spend a morning, afternoon or all day! Value is decent as half-day during this time was only about $60 US"

When the Cooking with Poo class was booked out, I emailed a few fellow expats & asked for a cooking class recommendation I could do with my mother in law - who is a brilliant cook - so her standards are high. All three recommended BaiPai. After a quick email we were booked in for the afternoon class - 1800THB. We had to BTS it to Asok where we were picked up & taken to the school, which is a little piece of paradise in the BKK burbs! Our guide was lovely, as was the chef. They gave us a quick run through the herb garden & showed us common Thai ingredients and why they are different to what's at home - eg Ginger v's Galangal & what we could substitute if we couldn't find it at home. We did 4 courses, all very yummy. The chef does a demo of the recipe first, then you move to your stations to do it yourself. To squeeze in that many dishes a lot of the prep work is done for you, eg the tenderloin for the spicy beef salad was already cooked. The food was delicious, I'm looking forward to trying the make the marinated chicken & peanut satay - yum! Compared to Cooking with Poo this is very slick. The environment is lovely, the English level excellent, the staff are lovely - a very polished outfit! I would recommend it and will certainly be going again."

Very clean, very attractive market. Got to learn about all the ingredients used in the dishes we were going to make later. Was very interesting. We then were driven to the house where the cooking took place, which is a beautiful open house in the Tchatutchak district where the cooking islands are downstairs and seating area upstairs.We received plenty of bottled water to keep us hydrated during the course and then we met the chef. The chef and his assistant - the young lady who had been with us at the market - explained every dish first, cooked the dish in front of us and then it was up to us to recreate it. With their help. In the end we could eat what we'd cooked.It was all in a very relaxed atmosphere, it was lots of fun and it was also very well organized.Everybody who worked there was so friendly and helpful.It really was a great experience which I most certainly would like to do again next time I'll be in Bangkok. And this is also true for my husband.After the cooking lesson we were driven back to our hotel.You don't need to bring anything, there are lockers to store valuables, everybody receives an apron and a towel.

We did the afternoon course and were picked up in a very clean and airconditioned van from where we were staying at 1245pm near Thanon Sathon. After collecting some other people we took the freeway and about 1/2 an hour later arrived at a beautiful traditional Thai collection of little 'sala' style two storey buildings. After a cool towel and some excellent icy cold lemongrass tea we did our introductions with Mr Tum, who was our guide for the afternoon, and Chef Nok's assistant.We had a group of 9 which was actually perfect, with a range of people from Australia (us 2 and 3 others), two Brits, and a German/Dutch couple. Everyone was very keen which helped, and readily asked questions of the very knowledgeable Chef Nok as we went along.Our menu consisted of Spring Rolls (made from scratch), Som Tum (spicy green papaya salad), Stir Fried Beef with Big Chillies and the best dish - Panang Curry (again - paste and all made completely from scratch). There are a number of other menus you can select from - it just means you select what day you want to attend to get that menu (the menus are aligned to certain days). There was another course finishing as we arrived but the changeover was seamless and we barely saw them as they finished up and left.The preparation behind the scenes was great and again seamless, by the team you'd been through the instruction part, your own individual cooking station behind you was ready with all the ingredients ready to be chopped up or whatever was necessary to make your dish.The first three dishes we made and then sat down to eat once each was ready. This is the first school I have done where you can buy beers to have while you eat - a bonus since the day was very hot and since the place has wide open walls and fans (no aircon) unless the fans are cranked or there is a breeze it can get quite warm. This is probably worsened in the afternoon, but that said it didn't detract from the course.The last dish took a bit of time to make but then we wandered upstairs with our plates and had rice and more beers with them. After that we moved to the office/boutique shop to pay (I thought that this was particularly good since they don't demand money up front - it makes the experience nicer in my eyes).After all was said and done the driver drove us back to our hotel and we arrived about 1815hrs. One of the best parts was having the pickup as opposed to trying to find your way to a particular place by a certain time. Another really nice touch was where they email you a number of photos that they take of you as the day goes on - and at no extra cost. The professional recipe cards in a little stand/folder are all available for sale (in case you can only do one course - that said there was a British fellow who had done the course 4 days before and returned to do another one since he liked it so much).Lastly - something I really liked was that we could do the course without going to visit a market. I have done a number of courses and been to the markets in a number of Asian countries while doing them, and while that's great the first few times - after that it's the same thing over again. This is a definite plus as you spend more time cooking."

We are not Thai kitchen experts (although we are big fans of Thai restaurants) so this was great help for us - that's why we took the course. We have done similar classes in Paris where we live and found Baipai much better than the French classes for French Cuisine!

Chef Nok and her off-sider Tum were awesome in conveying how to expertly prepare and cook the 4 dishes we made that morning. Also which was invaluable, the background for each ingredient and what to use and what not to use, especially with what you can source back home.Disregard the negative reviews relating to it being a basic and impersonal course; this was far from it. We had 9 people in our group and our hosts interacted with all of us. Also getting to know ingredients and why they are used and why others are not is part of being able to cook these dishes like a pro.Make sure you book at Baipai. It's a great way to spend half a day with these professional and entertaining hosts in Bangkok!"

            "review": "Look Elsewhere for a more Authentic Experience. My daughter and I signed up for the half day, afternoon session, at Baipai Thai Cooking School based upon a recommendation from one of my daughter's friends. The school is located in a beautiful setting outside of Bangkok. Upon arrival we were given a cooling cup of lemongrass iced tea and an apron. Next we were introduced to our instructors Tum and Chef Nok. No time was wasted! The cooking demonstration began immediately. The pace was exhilarating! Demonstration lesson, off to our cooking station to cook what we just learned, hurry up and cook, then eat...repeated until we cycled through all four of our recipes. Whew! The recipe cards are beautiful, the instructors personable and funny, the food was mediocre but pleasing to the tourist palate, the pace is ridiculous and the cost is comparatively expensive. If your visit to Thailand will extend to Chiang Mai, I would recommend waiting to attend cooking school there. Chiang Mai offers a plethora of cooking school options where you can receive full day instruction with more menu options for half the cost. If attending cooking school in Bangkok is your only option then I would suggest you look elsewhere for a more authentic Thai cooking school experience."

My husband and I booked a cooking class at Baipai as part of a 4 day trip to Bangkok - very glad we did as the class was top notch!We were picked up from our hotel (on time) and whisked away to a lovely residential part of the city. On arrival we were humbly welcomed with lemongrass tea and refreshing towels.We attended the morning class where we learnt how to prepare and cook golden tasty parcels, hot and spicy soup (Tom yum), Penang curry and fried pork rice.The class was enjoyable and made very entertaining and informative by Nat and her chef and team of helpers. The kitchen was clean and well equipped! Our workstations were always cleaned down for each item we cooked!The class had 9 people which was just right and did not feel too busy/ full.The line up was to watch the chef prep and cook an item and for you to follow at your own work station. This line up worked very well and it was highly interactive and fun.The reciepes learnt were delicious and we had plenty of time to enjoy the food we had made over a drink, without feeling rushed in making the next item.After class, the school then took us to back to the City to a location of our choice! An excellent service!The cost of the class was well worth it, it included ingredients, learning to cook 4 great traditional items, eating the 4 items, detailed recipe cards and a reliable pick up and drop off service!Shame we were only in Bangkok for 4 fun filled days! Greedily, it would be great to have squeezed in another excellent class... Next time :)"

We attended the half day course in the afternoon, it was a great mix of learning new skills, entertainment and great food. The course kept you entertained the whole time, even though the course was fast paced and you came away with recipe cards to attempt everything at home again.Basically the chef and assistant would do a demo then you would go back to your own station and attempt what you had just been shown. It was not complex cooking which made it entertaining and easy to follow along.We had Chef Noi and she was very funny and helpful (a bit like your mum watching you cook in the kitchen) and the assistant was Tum a bit of a comedy duo.Once you cooked each course you would sit at a communal table to eat it, at which point you could also order drinks which you paid for (beer, soft drinks & water).Highly recommend the experience whilst in Bangkok."

I was keen to learn how to cook some of my favourite Thai recipes - but the friendly staff made this much more than a cooking lesson. The day started at 9am when the mini-bus picked me up from where I was staying - we headed to the Or Tor Kor market which was full of local produce, Thai delicacies and beautiful orchids. The very charming Nathana (from Bai Pai) led the tour, inviting us to smell the herbs and taste fruits and sweets. From the market we were taken to the Bai Pai Cooking School. Set in a beautiful wooden building, surrounded by lovely gardens, the setting could not have been better to learn how to cook Thai food.The cooking demonstrations were fast; but recipes were provided for us to follow. After the demo, we each went to our station to try and recreate the dish. I specifically chose the day to attend based on the dishes on the schedule to cook for that day. We learnt to make 4 dishes, and we tasted each dish along the way. The last dish was eaten upstairs as lunch which was a nice way to finish the day.The bus returned us all home after lunch - I was home around 2pm.I guess that the amount of fun depends on having a good group in your class - but our group of 11 was very diverse, and there is no shortage of things to chat about with the common denominator of Thai cooking! Attending solo is no problem at all.I highly recommend this school - the staff were extremely professional and friendly. They never seemed to stop smiling which infused the day with warmth.A highlight of this visit to Bangkok !"

My partner was a little sceptical at first but by the end of the session, couldn't stop raving about it! There is nothing to fault about this experience though it may be a little basic if you have some experience cooking Asian food. There is however a good enough mix of instruction and participation (everyone gets their own work station) to hold your attention throughout. The set-up was world class, very well-maintained with high level of cleanliness. Lots of interesting tips about substitutes if you can't get the right ingredients, or which part of a spring onion to use etc Aside from keeping us out of the bars too early in the day, this was a memorable experience we're still talking about a few days after."

They were very caring and arranged for a taxi to pick me up and take me back to the airport - and they spoke to the taxi driver as I had been ripped off by the taxi that had brought me from the airport.

Despite this, preparing Thai food always eluded me, even when I would hunt down the ingredients at the local Asian market and follow recipes to the letter. So when I made my recent visit to Bangkok, I was eager to take part in a cooking class. Mind you, this is my second visit to Bangkok, so in terms of prioritizing \"what to do\" during this visit, I had seen many of the sights previously.Blue Elephant cooking school was recommended by my extended family in Bangkok. But I found nothing but good things about Bai Pai online.I called, and, as I was interested in making the most of my time, inquired about setting up a private class (just me, the chef and his assistant). This would let me pick my favorite items to prepare, rather than being stuck with one of the seven menus-whichever one was featured for the class for the day. They were very helpful in making this possible and were very good at following-up to finalize the arrangements by email.I will say the private cooking class was not a cheap endeavor. If you have flexibility in your schedule and can pick a course day when one of your favorite items might be featured in the pre-chosen menu, then that is the way to go, as it is only around $60. The private class for me was around $275 to prepare any 5 items of my choice. They provided transportation to their school, located near the Chatuchak Market (and BTS station). The school is the pleasant little oasis. In talking with their staff, this school is a new location that was recently constructed (an older location nearer the city they have closed). They have little lockers onsite for storage of you personal items during your class. I was welcomed with a little cup of tea, and provided an apron to keep tidy during the class.The mies en place for each of the items we were to prepare was perfect. The materials/menu cards were beautiful. The kitchens: perfectly equipped. The chef and his assistant spoke wonderful english and were welcoming, informative, patient and professional. The chef had me go through the step with him during the preparation of things like curry pastes. He would then cook the item, to demonstrate, then I would go to my station and try my hand at preparing the item. He would watch, and coach, as I went along.After preparing each of the items (which they keep warm for you-total time, door-to-door, about 5 hours) you get to enjoy what you have made. Go hungry, as it is enough food for a small family!As it was a Friday and traffic would have taken FOREVER to get back to the hotel via their shuttle (traffic!!), I had them drop me at the Chatuchuk BTS station. I would highly recommend!"

We learned 4 recipes in about 3 hours time. The ingredients were prepped in a way that allowed you just enough hands on experience but not too much work...and chef Noi demonstrated each dish before you cooked it at an individual station (under guidance from the chef and assistants.) What makes the Baipai stand out from other cooking classes: the prepped ingredients and organization, reminders for frequent hand washing, you make and taste your own food (no teams where you make only partof one dish), lots of picture opportunities (your own and by the staff) and nice recipe cards.You should try for a morning class starting around 10am because it is cooler out and be aware their new garden fountain is not yet finished, but you can see how gorgeous it will be once done!"

The lesson was conducted in English by a very cheeful lady who had a good sense of humour. The banter between the chef and her assistant is cute.

I was originally bummed because I wanted to take the class with papaya salad but I was happy with my selection. Two teachers guided us through a demonstration and then we would go to our stations to cook the food. All the students ate together after each dish. The final two dishes were eaten in the dining area upstairs. You get a folder with recipes and a photo magnet at the end of the class. They also email pictures to you. It was kinda expensive but worth the price."

At the introductions my wife admitted that she doesn't cook (any more - after bring up two sons) yet our photos show the delight in her face as she discovered the fun this class provides. The layout of the area is so well done and to food gave me a new appreciation of Thai cooking. This was our 6th visit to Bangkok and it will not be the last to Baipai. One our fellow guest was asttending morning and afternoon sessions every day. That should say something!"

We watched the teacher cook the meal, very much like MasterChef on TV, which even had a mirror above the teacher so you didnt miss out on anything. Once you were shown how to prepare the meal, you went over to your own cooking station to find all the ingredients carefully arranged on your bench. You then prepared your ingredients and started cooking! It was so much fun and we were well looked after by the wonderful staff - they were very supportive and attentive to our needs, even the novice slow cookers! Continual flow of water refills in our glasses ensured we didnt dehydrate with the heat. We got a lovely photo souveneir of our cooking, as well as the set of recipes we made and they even emailed the photos taken on the day! A must DO for even the worst cook!

The place is first class from beginning to end. They will pick you up wherever you are staying. (They said they would be there \"Between 1:00 and 1:10\" - at 1:07 the Baipai van pulled up outside the hotel and we were off)We were there with a couple from Ireland, a guy from France, a woman from Romania, a woman who grew up in Thailand and her Brazilian boyfriend, and a single woman form Manchester. A fantastic group - plenty of time to eat and chat. IMHO it was the right mix of watching, learning, and then doing it yourself. The right amount of time -the right amount of food. I couldn't find a single thing to complain about. Oh - and no hidden fees. The 1800 the charge is the 1800 they charge. Yeah - if you have a beer with dinner they'll charge you, but they even keep your water glass full the entire class. You get beautiful copies of the recipes and a refrigerator magnet with your picture on it, and a bunch of other pictures e-mailed afterward.This place is clearly designed for tourists, but they execute it so flawlessly you won't even realize it. They require everyone to be smiling - and threaten you with doing the dishes if you don't - it was hilarious - tasty."

We were a little leery considering some of the reviews on TA, but it is not often my husband agrees to take a cooking class with me, so we decided to take a chance!Yes, the chef prepares the dish the first time for you and discusses the ingredients and history of the dish at this time. He also provides possible substitutions you can purchase at home for any of the more exotic ingredients like palm sugar. Yes, many of the ingredients are prepared and measured for you when you go to cook your own. We found this very helpful as we did not want to cut our fingers on vacation...;) We did use a mortar and pestle to crush ingredients, separated a pomelo (like grapefruit) section for the salad and chopped a shallot and green onion in addition to cooking in a wok. Yes, when the hostess prompted, \u201cwhat time is it?\u201d we did cheer, \u201cit\u2019s eating time\u201d! This made the class feel like an interactive Food Network show: something Paula or Guy would get a kick out of!The chef was knowledgeable, the hostess was upbeat and fun and both brightened the afternoon with many smiles. We shared stories with the other classmates of travel and cooking. Who would think you can learn about Texas dry rub ribs at a Thai cooking class? We were driven back to our hotel full from the tasty food and smiling at the fun afternoon learning Thai cooking secrets!If you are looking for a serious culinary arts/cordon bleu experience, you should try taking a private class. The BaiPai Cooking School is exactly what is advertises to be \u201ca culinary adventure\u201d-perfect to entertain and teach tourist!"

The school offers a rolling series of 4 hour cooking classes morning and afternoon, and you could do them for a week and never cook the same dish twice. (This is a possibility if you want to cover the whole range...one of the great things about Thai food is that the same ingredients end up different depending on what you do with them)Our host, a young English speaking woman, Kedsara ( Marie for those who can't cope in Thai!) is witty and well spoken. She was accompanied on this occasion by Noi who was a brilliant and clear cooking demonstrator.Groups are small (up to 12 I think) and most people will be picked up from the hotel, and the setting is a large open Thai kitchen spoitlkessly clean and light and airy. A stress free kitchen, amazing!Four dishes were demonstrated which would enable you to prepare a full Thai meal...Rice Crackers (make your own) with various different toppings, the lovely Pomelo Salad, the classic Massaman Curry (make your own paste!), and stir fried chicken and deep fried Basil leaves!You see everything being made, and then you do it yoursself. Everyone has an individual work station, and all ingredients aree carefully prepared to make it flow smoothly.You get to eat your own food. There are light refreshments.Best of all you get a folder with the recipes and you can take notes and ask questions. All the ingredients are explained, and you can ask dumb questions and not feel foolishCosts about 1600THB (about $30-$40) which for pickup and four hour course and class is pretty reasonable.When we arrived home we were delighted to find that there were 5 lovely photos emailed to us of my daughter and I.A lot of thought and care has gone into this. It's fantastic"

Was also taking the class with friends which would be their first time whom also wanted that specific menu. If I choose to pay for a repeat class which I would like to take with friends I should be able to. Due to allergies, only certain classes appeal to me.

            "review": "Combining Class not a Cooking Class. Good, if you like being talked down to. Vicky, the chef\u2019s assistant, treated us as if we were taking a cooking course for kids. She asks you to enthusiastically repeat the names of dishes. If you just mutter it under your breath, she makes the whole class repeat again and again until we sound like a chorus of baboons performing a trick to zoo goers. The format is set up where you watch the chef cook first and then you get 5 minutes at your station to prepare the same dish that took the chef 15 minutes to cook. It feels like they are rushing you through the class. If you take a second to read the recipe as opposed to just dumping all the pre-portioned ingredients into your wok, Vicky comes over and does it for you. During one of the recipes, she said my dish was finished when the chicken was clearly still purple. Not just a little pink, but purple. Don\u2019t let her push you around. You\u2019re the one who has to eat your cooking, so take your time and cook it right. On another dish, she watched me dump my seasonings in immediately followed by the protein. Then she yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s burnt.\u201d Really? I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s dark brown or black. How is my dish burnt already?Anyway, I think her purpose is to translate the chef, but he speaks perfect English. So, instead, she just repeats what he says. \u201cNow you add sugar.\u201d \u201cSUGAR.\u201d \u201c\u2026and salt.\u201d \u201cSALT.\u201d \u201c\u2026and chilies.\u201d \u201cCHILIES.\u201d However, the most annoying part of Vicky, that made my eyes roll, is when she would insult you and then say, \u201cI\u2019m joking,\u201d with her strange interpretation of a British accent.I felt like I was sitting through and infomercial with an overly enthusiastic annoying host constantly soliciting exciting remarks and applause. When it was time for us to cook, she would ask, \u201cWhat \u2013 time \u2013 is \u2013 it?\u201d and waited for our annoyed reply of \u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 Cooking \u2013 Time.\u201dThe food was pretty good, but most of the cooking is done by the silent helpers who pre-portion the ingredients at your station. When you reach your station, all you have to do is dump the ingredients into the wok and stir. That\u2019s why I described it as a Combining Class and not a Cooking Class. You can pretty much find the same thing at any Gourmet Grocery Store where they have pre-packaged foods that you combine at home in your frying pan and feel like you\u2019ve made a home-cooked meal.At 1800bht a person, this was the biggest waste of money in Bangkok. I wish we tried the cooking class offered at our hostel, which was only 500bht. Even if it wasn\u2019t very good, at least you don\u2019t feel trapped b/c BaiPai is located way South of Central Bangkok. If we tried to walk out (which we considered), we wouldn\u2019t be able to find a taxi or the local Skytrain station. All in all, I\u2019m giving this 2 stars, b/c the food did taste good. The experience was horrible though."

Given the opportunity again, I wouldnt have done it differently. Baipai cooking school was great from start to finish. We got picked up in an airconditioned van (all 12 of us) from our hotel bright and early and then went to the market where we picked up some of the products we would be using for the course. In addition, at the market we were allowed to sample different customary thai vegetables, spices, curry pastes, and coconut milk crepes.  Upon arriving back at the school, the instructors guide you through the various dishes we made. Since they help prepare a good amount of the dishes in advance, it made Thai cooking seem easy and delicious!!! I highly suggest looking at their very friendly website, and picking the menu which suits your tastes best. We did exactly that, Menu 1, and were happy with every dish we made. Overall, the facilities are extremely clean and the instructors were extremely personable (we had \"Vicky\"), which led to a great experience. In addition, they were accomodating by dropping us off at Siam rather then going all the way back to our hotel."

Having eaten thai food on numerous occasions, we were lead to believe that it was one of the most complex cusines to make but having taken the class, we found out that it is all in the preparation.Mick was our guide through the cooking whilst we had the chef, called \"teacher\" actually doing the cooking. We had 4 dishes to prepare and cook during the lesson and an insight into all the various Thai ingredients. The lesson was great, as we got to cook and eat what we made as the lesson went on, plus both of us had fun cooking together. There was plenty of room for each student to cook, without getting hot oil on each other.This is a very well thoughtout establishment, with a overhead mirror reflecting what is in the chefs pan whilst she was cooking. Definitely well worth a visit as this is a lasting souvenir of Thailand that can be given to all your friends back home when you make these dishes.Jaiandash"

The cooking class very intimate-about 12 people, with 4 whom had taken other cooking classes at the same school, implying they had a great experience. greeted by the bai pai staff, which included a translator and our teacher, both made a great and entertaining pair who complemented each other. spoke excellent english. the facility very clean and serene despite being in the busy, loud, crowded environement of bangkok. we donned on our apron with a washcloth and began the cooking class. teacher demonstrated, we ate samples, and then cooked ourselves. the recipes were printed on beautiful pictured souvenirs. we didn't get to see the morning market on this particular class but had heard that this is available with other classes. overall, each cooking demonstration was interactive, fun, and insightful. explained meaning, technique, ingredients, etc. we got to know the other participants in the class, all of whom very friendly and had good conversation when we had the chance to sample our creation at a table. I would say overall, a great value and great experience while in Bangkok. Had heard the Oriental has a cooking class but much more expensive. I appreciate not only the value but also the laid back but very well planned and orchestrated style of Bai Pai. They also had a personal touch of providing magnets of picture taken during the class for souvenir. Lastly, they provided transportation back and were very receptive to making sure we got back to the hotel on timely basis. A big thumbs up for this school. They apparently will be sending pictures via email taken throughout the class and we are awaiting for those."

A few years ago I had taken a half day lesson at Baipai Thai Cooking School and really enjoyed it so it was back for another lesson. The school is reasonably priced around $50 for a lesson and that includes pick up at your hotel. The school is small with largest class size less than a dozen. Each student has there own work station, yes it is hands on and lunch is included, 4 courses you cook yourself my blog has photos and more info http://apps.charleswdavisjr.com/blog/you should make this a mandatory stop in any Thailand visit"

This class was so much fun, one of the gals in our group had taken another class a couple days prior and decided to take another. When I go back, I plan to do the same. :)You are given recipe cards with images, and at the end of class they give you a little treat. I wont tell you. They also sell a few things. I purchased the black apron.Ah, one thing. Several tour companies will book this class for you but in our research it's more expensive for the same thing. It was a better value for us to book direct through the school.Here's the link:http://www.baipai.com"

They had a really great chemistry and the dishes we cooked were fabulous. It was relaxed, informative and I am planning to find a thai grocery shop in London this week so I can cook what I learnt this weekend!

Lot's of fun.....while you are watching the chef, attendants clean your cook station and restock it with the items you will need next to prepare your next dish.

Throughout the course you could buy beer, water, soft drinks etc. to have with your meals, all at very reasonable costs Photos are taken throughout the course & when we finished we were each presented with a framed photo of ourselves which could also be used as a magnet.

This is a must for anyone who likes Thai food and wants to know the exact way to cook it and what to use and where to obtain it. I was never that keen on Thai food however I was holidaying in Bangkok with a friend who is very interested in Thai cooking and I went along with her just for the experience and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the class and I now feel that I will enjoy Thai food much more because I have done the course, The teacher and the commentator are very good and explain everything to you. You have your own stove and you get to cook the food to your taste be it very hot or very mild and of course then you get to eat it. If you want you can buy beer etc to have with your meal. Before you start cooking you are taken to the market to purchase the food you are going to cook and this is an experience in itself for the normal Australian who goes to the supermarket to buy their food. Highest praise for this course and the way it is conducted."

We then got our turn at cooking. We made a spicy green papaya salad, green chicken curry, coloured sticky rice and mango pudding. If you are looking for more hands on cooking, like doing your own rice, slicing all these veg or making your own curry paste, the class we took may disappoint, but it was an absolute highlight for us.The only complaint I have was that the price was a bit steep."

A driver collected us from our hotel and drove us to the dock where a friendly lady took us to the cooking school on the river via boat. Once at the school (which we discovered was set-up amazingly well in Tam's family courtyard) we were warmly welcomed by Tam, the school's founder and head teacher. She runs with the school with her cousins and has a rotating roster for the menu. Our day involved papaya salad, green Thai curry, satay chicken, and mango with rice. The class started with a tour of her garden and Tam gave us both a lot of new information about herbs and plants used in Thai cuisine. After that, Tam ran an interactive cooking demonstration which was made seemless by her two support cousins; one did the dishess, and the other played sous chef providing Tam with the ingredients, \"this-is-what-I-prepared-earlier\" food, and taking away used implements. The presentation was incredible. I've never seen such a tightly run ship. Tam gave Mum and I all the dishes to devour after she cooked them and, of course, they were all supremely delicious. We then went to our cooking stations which Tam and her family had carefully built for teaching groups of students with ease. Tam and her sous chef cousin assisted us in preparing our own versions of the meal and gave us plenty of helpful tips in the process.We then ate and ate and ate. A four-course meal - we were stuffed. But Tam being hte uber-organised person she is, our leftovers were packed up quickly for us to take on our way. The driver who collected us from the hotel was there again at the end and transported us in air-conditioned comfort back to the hotel again.I would definitely recommend this experience to other travellers because it fun, interesting, educational and yum!"

We were delighted to find ourselves in a private class since we went in the rainy season, but the weather was gorgeous. I couldn't believe it was sold out. The food was without a doubt, the most authentic and delicious I had in Bangkok. It was made all the more special by the fact we made it with excellent and friendly instruction. Tam and her family were so welcoming and helpful. This family-run business was a highlight of our trip.

If you would like to go home with very warm memories of Bangkok and an authentic experience of Thai culture and people, then most definitely take a cooking class with Tam. You get so very much for your money. First, a very kind gentleman picked me up from my hotel (my hotel was a long way away from the city center and Tam did not charge me extra for picking me up). Then, you are taken to the boat pier in an interesting section of old Bangkok. Another gentleman accompanies you to Tam's house via boat through the canal system. The canal trip alone is a very interesting and eye-opening experience because you not only see some of the monuments that old Bangkok has to offer, you also see how the people live on the canal (and the interesting water creatures that reside there as well). Tam and her family are waiting for you at their private dock at their residence. The classes are held in an outside kitchen (granite counter tops individual stoves in a covered pavilion) in Tam's backyard. She has another covered pavilion for eating the dishes afterwards). After refreshing you with traditional drinks, Tam takes the time to show you her herb garden (how often do you see a turmeric plant) and you pick, smell and discuss the history of the herbs and their health benefits. In addition, she has some delightful characters in her garden including a rather naughty talking bird and an arrogant rooster! You will be delighted at the local boat traffic (nothing touristy here) that floats by honking their horns and selling their wares as they have for many decades. Tam will then talk you through each dish, discussing the ingredients and the proper way to prepare the dish. After watching, her family members will then assist you in cooking the very same dishes (everything is prechopped and prepared all you have to do is cook). No messy clean ups! Then everyone takes their food to the tables and enjoys a meal together. Tam (never still) is busy cutting fruit and introducing you to almost local favorites that you might not have tried in the market. (Note, there is a locker to keep your belongings while you cook, and very clean bathroom facilities).All in all, this was one of my favorite experiences in Bangkok. I recommend that you not miss it!"

The transport arrived on time and the trip there included a 40 minute boat trip down the river which is always fun. Tam and her team were so efficient and the class was very well organised. We got to eat the dishes we cooked too.The company of Tam's mynah bird was also great for us being bird lovers.Thoroughly recommend this cooking adventure!"

Getting out at 8am means that you actually get to enjoy Bangkok when it's not stinking hot! The 30 min boat road to Amita Class was just a great touch! Our lovely instructor, Tam and her great team which is made up of her family, are just lovely. We were treated with some welcoming appetizers (tempura of fresh greens picked from her own organic garden) and refreshing drink. Tam then showed us around the the beautiful garden afterwards and introduced to us all the herbs we'd be using for our class later in the morning.The class was very easy to follow and the great team Tam has defo helped every step along the way. Tam has a great sense of humor as well.Altho the price is slightly higher than the other ones I found on google but this is totally worth it.Really and it was one of the best meals too I had there! :)"

The boat ride itself is really amazing, and took about 40 minutes. Once there, we toured Tam's herb garden and learned the medicinal and cooking applications for the various herbs. Tam is personable and obviously takes great pride in her family compound of three generations. I've always been interested in learning Thai cooking, and this was an excellent introduction. The demonstrations were clear and easy to follow. We then made two dishes followed by a sumptuous lunch. I also really enjoyed the company of my two german classmates...a mother and a daughter. I would recommend this highly!"

The journey along Bangkok's waterways by water taxi (included in the cost) was a great start to the day. We disembarked at the private jetty & entered a perfect oasis away from the hassle yet in the midst of the city. This is a family run school and everything was well organised and friendly. The herbs and spices we used, we sampled fresh from the garden and everything was cooked from scratch. I'm a beginner & some of our group were chefs but everyone was accommodated at their level & when we ate our meal in the pagoda by the river, it was terrific. The riverside garden is lush & peaceful. Everyone was helpful, friendly & fun. Check out the minah bird, he's hilarious! I'd highly recommend this wonderful place & wish them well for the future."

Me and my husband made our reservation for the class on the school website and at 8 am a driver on a van showed up at our hotel as it was programmed. He took us to a hotel pier and from there we took a boat together with other people who would take the class with us.The boat ride takes about 30 minutes taking you to a residential area of Bangkok where boats are usually used by residents.We got to the school and we met Tam, our teacher. She invited us for some tea and some appetizers. In a very relaxing atmosphere and chatting we went around her garden as she gave us leaves and roots of typical thai ingridients to smell, taste and learn their names. That was really special. Later we all set around a table where she cooked each one of the dishes that we would learn to prepare. She showed us the ingredients, gave us great tips on how to cook and we had a sample of each one. Then it was our turn to cook on our own. Each one received a set with the ingredients and with the help of some assistants we managed to cook the dishes step by step. When everything was ready we sat and had a wonderful lunch.mit was so much food I could hardly eat half of it. It was a wonderful day I'll never forget."

Tam and her staff do a wonderful job teaching about Thai cooking and modeling the dishes to begin. Afterwards, we got to try our hand at three of the dishes. The food was phenomenal and the recipes are actually things I will try to recreate at home. This is a must do if you have a morning/early afternoon free."

A search online gave us several options from which we selected Amita.Right from the start the organisation of our event was very good. We were met by an Amita representative who took us to our hotel's pier where a boat was waiting to take us to the Amita family compound. The river journey lasted about 40 minutes - longer than anticipated due to the volume of river traffic at the locks - not a delay to complain about - sitting on a boat on the Chao Pray River on a sunny morning! On arrival at the site we were warmly welcomed by Tam the course teacher. On this morning we were the only two 'students' so throughout the lesson we had individual attention. After an introduction to the course content we had a tour around the compound's herb garden where we learnt a lot about different herbs used in Thai cooking - very interesting and informative.The 'classroom' consists of the teacher's cooking station and can accommodate a maximum of ten students. Tam explained very clearly what we would be cooking - Khao Mun Som Tum (Coconut Rice and Papaya Salad), Satay (Moo, Gai or Nua) - a choice of Pork, Chicken or Beef, Khang Keaw Wan Gai (Green Curry Chicken in Coconut Milk) and Khao Niew Ma Muang (Mango Sticky Rice). In the first section we stood at Tam's station watching and listening as she explained the ingredients, cooked the dishes and at the same time gave us a running commentary on what she was doing and why - fascinating!Then, it was our turn. We were given preparation/instruction cards for the dishes we were to prepare. Tam and another member of her family stood by and gave us adivice when necessary as we prepared the same dishes which Tam had prepared. The finale - on completion of the cooking, our dishes were taken from our stations and set out on a table located under a canopy in the garden. When we approached the table the dishes we had cooked looked wonderful and we have to say, they tasted wonderful too - not because we are accomplished in cooking Thai food but because of the excellent care and attention we received during the session! At the conclusion of the course we were driven back to our hotel by an Amita representative. From start to finish the course was run in a professional but relaxed manner. On our next visit to Bangkok we would hope to have another session at Amita and learn to cook more Thai dishes. We have no hesitation in recommending Amita to others"

First we were picked up on time by a driver to meet our water taxi and fellow classmates. It took us about 20 minutes or so to reach the school by water taxi. However this gave us time to get to know the other people in our class. It also gives you another view on Bangkok living going through the canal to see people's homes and the wildlife there.We reached the school and was greeted by Tam (the owner) with a drink and cool towel. There was a beautiful table set outdoors (but covered) next to the garden. It was such a welcoming and awesome place to spend the day. Tam did her introductions and we proceeded to the garden to get familiar with some of our ingredients. She also has a talking parrot that is cute but not annoying. After our tour through the garden, we went to the outdoor kitchen where we watched Tam cook the dishes first then we prepared the same dishes with help from her staff. Once everyone has completed their dishes, we took our food to the table where we had lunch together. I would recommend paying attention to all instructions because you eat what you cook. It was a great experience that I highly recommend."

Our hotel was on the Chao Praya River, and we were picked up by boat promptly on schedule at 8:30AM. After a short boat ride down the river and a beautiful canal we arrived at Tam's family's compound. We were welcomed with some light, delicious snacks of tempura herbs from Tam's garden and fresh pressed lemongrass juice complete with lemongrass straws. Tam introduced us to all the herbs and spices that we would be using during the class - all grown in her own garden which overlooks the canal. Tam had a charming rooster named See Ew or Soy Sauce and a very funny bird named Basil. We started the class by watching Tam perform a demonstration of each course (of which we got to try everything). It was absolutely delicious, and Tam broke things down in such a way that was entertaining and easy to follow. Her sister's fiance mixed us up some Thai tea as a treat while we watched; the small attention to detail was truly heartwarming. Our menu included spicy fresh papaya salad, pork satay with spicy peanut sauce, green chicken curry with green coconut rice, and mango with sticky rice. Every course was outstanding, and it was fascinating to see Tam use herbs to color the rice green. She even crushed up some edible blue flowers to turn the sticky rice for dessert purple. It was absolutely beautiful. We then each suited up in an apron and made each dish at our own station. All the ingredients were prepared for us in little bowls, and Tam and her relatives stood by as we recreated the dishes. After only a couple minor spills we sat down at a the table overlooking the canal to enjoy. Needless to say we needed a nap after how much we ate! While we were enjoying the food, Tam's nephew Tian came around and drew Henna tattoos for us. He was quite an artist and it was an unexpected surprise. The whole thing lasted until 2:30PM when Tam's husband drove us back to our hotel. They make certain to only book one group per day so that everyone gets a truly unique, relaxed experience. Everything about this class was fantastic and I would absolutely recommend it!!!"

We were driven with 1 other guest to a boat then travelled to Tam's house on a canal. Unfortunately it was raining but we didn't let this spoil our day. Upon arrival we were treated to specially cooked snacks and a yummy lemongrass drink. It was very relaxing as Tam told us about how to cook the snacks as we waited for another 2 guests to arrive.We went for a tour around the garden learning about herbs which we found interesting. We were all given an umbrella so the rain didn't bother us.Tam then cooked each dish and explained how to cook it all the while. After we were each led to our own cooking stations and we all cooked the dishes. My husband has never really cooked and he found it easy and enjoyable. There is no pressure. There are plenty of family members to help. The table was set beautifully for lunch and we enjoyed all the food we had cooked. There is definitely plenty of food! We had had breakfast at about 9am. Lunch wasn't cooked until after 2pm but we felt fine as we tasted Tam's cooking along the way. Bathroom facilities excellent.As it was my birthday, my husband had apparently told them and they all lines up and sang Happy Birthday and presented me with a lovely wooden cooking spoon! I thought that was really sweet.We arrived back at the hotel around 5pm.We both thought it was a great way to spend the day...highly recommend!!!!!!!!"

I was really happy with the day, which as most people have said starts with a spot-on-time hotel pickup, an interesting trip up the river and into a side klong, then to Tam\u2019s atmospheric house on the khlong. I consider my husband and I to be very well informed about Asian food \u2013 we have lived and worked in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia and we tend to hang with the locals, not living an \u2018expat\u2019 life so we encounter a lot of local food. Nevertheless, we learned quite a few things about the herbs and plants in Tam\u2019s garden and although we already cooked most of the dishes included in the class at home, spending time listening to Tam was like being in the home of a local friend and picking up tips on their way of doing things. There were only four people in total the day we were there so it was really easy to engage Tam in conversation and ask questions that were specifically of interest to us. We learned a lot, enjoyed the atmosphere and cooked some aroi food. I will attach some photos, as I like to take pics. It was not a cheap day, but I felt the money was well spent, unlike many mass, herd-\u2018em-around day tours one could take. We NEVER go on group things so I was nervous about this, but it all worked out perfectly."

We were picked up from our hotel and driven to a pier and caught a motor boat up to the Amita Cooking Class. Tam greets you with a cup of tea and some nice little eating treats. The fun really begins when Tam demonstrates your four courses with very clear and easy to understand steps. You then cook the same courses with guidance from Tam and her assistant. We then all sat down and ate our meals which were wonderful.Make sure you get to meet the cheeky minor bird \"Kapow\" he is amazing with his sounds as well as 'Soy Soy' and 'White Sesame'. You are dropped back to your hotel on completion. It is well worth 3000 baht (AUS$93) per person. You can even buy cooking utensils at a very reasonable price."

Amita, or Tam, who leads the class is warm, humourous and knowledgeable. Different recipes are taught on different days of the week. First, you're shown the basic ingredients, then Tam demonstrates how to cook the dishes before the hands on session. Classes are limited to 12, so there is lots of individual attention. This ia a relaxed, enjoyable and instructive way to spend half a day. Highly recommended."

From the morning pick up at the Hotel right through to the end everything was made easy for us. The ferry transfer was a great insight into the Old Bangkok capital and way of life. Tam has a wealth of knowledge, great humour and really welcomes you into her home. We learnt heaps about Thai ingredients, culture, and the preparation of their food. There was six of us in the class and we all had a great time with lots of laughs (and FOOD!). Tam has a great set up, everything is super clean and ...no dishes! We definately will remember this cooking class experience and highly recommend it to anyone with a keen interest in food."

We were ushered into her outdoor dining room and we tried a beautiful lemon drink with some herbs from the garden done tempura style.Then we wandered around the garden looking and smelling different herbs that Tan would be demonstrating in the class.Next it was a full on demonstration of four different dishes with Tan showing how easy it was to cook each dish. After each dish was cooked we got to taste each one. Next was our turn. We have twin 13 year old boys and Tam concentrated helping them whilst other in her family assisted the rest of the group. We then ate our feast at the outdoor dining table again with Tam introducing exotic fruits for desert. We were suitably full once we had finsihed.We would not hesitate in recommending Amita Thai Cooking Class to anyone as you are going to someone's home... Tam we'll be back."

I endorse all the positive comments to date: an exceptionally well-organised set-up, from pick up at my private address, the fascinating boat ride through the klongs to get to the delightful suburban villa location, and the way that every aspect of the learning experience had been carefully thought through. There was probably more demonstration than actual doing, and the helpful way in which all the ingredients were lined-up in precisely measured portions meant all the students really do is add them to the pot in the right area and stir whilst trying to give the impression we know what we're doing. But the whole experience is great fun, ending with an excellent substantial dinner on the veranda - and most importantly it works so well because of Tam's patience and delightful personality."

I was picked up at my hotel and driven to a boat pier on the river, then taken to house on the river (after 20 mins or so on the boat). Apparently an are where it used to be the old capital of Thailand. You feel like you're quite a ways away from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok. The house is surrounded with a fantastic herb garden. Tam, the instructor and owner of house, gave us a tour and introduced all herbs that are typical to Thai cuisine.Tam cooked few typical Thai dishes for us, explaining the history, the ingredients, etc. Then we were provided all the ingredients to cook all the dishes ourselves. At the end we sat on the veranda (by the river, under lovely shaded area) and what we prepared. It was a fantastic experience. At the end, we were then taken back to our hotels. Thanks Tam for a great experience - I'll do it again next time I'm Bangkok."

My one disappointment was that when we went to the market, we didn't get to walk around and shop for ingredients but went to one stall where everything was already pulled aside for us. It was very interesting though to learn about the different smells and tastes of Thai cooking. And the class itself was incredibly entertaining and impressive. We had a 5 course meal - shrimp Pad Thai, a salad, spring rolls with sweet chili sauce, chicken in green curry, and mango with sticky rice. I was a bit disappointed that a lot of the food was prepped and cooked for us, but considering how much needed to be done in the time given this makes sense. And there was still plenty of hands on fun, followed by eating. And the ambience of the school was really incredible!"

My wife and I participated in a Silom Cooking school after receiving a recommendation from a German friend who had done it several months earlier. We love food and were looking for an opportunity to learn a little more about Thai culture through their food.While the market experience was fairly brief, it gave us a better understanding of various vegetables, spices, etc. that are used in thai cooking. Definitely a plus to experience this.The actual class was thoroughly enjoyable. We were kept busy for the entire time, never felt rushed, and enjoyed the delicious fruits of our labor. The smaller class size (10 people) kept the class intimate and enjoyable and made the experience feel more like we were in a chef's home versus in a cooking class (the building was actually a small house, so that contributed to this feeling as well).The instruction was well presented and clear and we truly felt like we learned a lot from the class. The take-away recipe book at the end of the class will definitely be used back home!We'd highly recommend Silom to anyone else visiting Bangkok and looking for this type of experience."

Cooked up Hot and sour prawn soup, pad Thai, red curry paste for our red curry, fish cakes, sticky rice pudding with mango - I must say I was impressed with my own dishes! Just right, and you get to eat everything you cook. That's dinner sorted for tonight! We were in their new building which was great, nice and spacious and very well decorated and set up. Nice aircon downstairs where we all prepared and ate our dishes, upstairs however (where we cooked) was a sauna, hopefully they might be able to get aircon up there at some stage or an extractor fan. Nice sized group. Our chef Goong made the whole experience an absolute delight. Fantastic sense of humour, perfect English and excellent teaching and people skills! Good value for money too!

We were treated to a quick tuk-tuk ride to the cooking school, donned aprons and got ready to chop. Each participant had her own work station, as well as own wok for cooking. We watched our instructor make coconut cream and coconut milk, and were able to taste many of the ingredients in the dishes. We made a soup, salad, and entree and were able to enjoy these dishes for lunch, ending with the traditional mango sticky rice. A bonus of this class was receiving a book with all the recipes. Also worth noting - the decor of the cooking school was quite charming!"

First you sit in airconditioned (god bless it) rooms while the instructors give you some background on what you will be cooking and how to do it.Then you go outside into a hallway where there individual cooking burners set up for each student. There is a teacher there to guide you through the instructions and help you if you get stuck. We were there in May and it was 100F outside - almost unbearable. Instructors were awesome and the entire class was really authentic and enjoyable."

We wanted to try something new on our latest trip to Bangkok so we made a booking for an afternoon class with Silom Cooking School. The booking process was a breeze and they replied you with all the details you need very speedily. Locating the meeting point took a bit of detective work using Google Street View, but I think that is mainly the problem of Thai street names not being very consistent when translated into English. We were provided with bottles of water upon reaching the meeting point (which was really helpful because it was really warm in Bangkok then!) and then brought to the market. The 'market tour' (for the afternoon class, at least) as some others have said before, isn't really a tour. We were basically brought to a store opposite the market where the guide explained to us the ingredients we will be using. She then distributed the various ingredients needed into the baskets we were holding onto (just for the experience?). We then took a tuk tuk from the market to the school. The 'school' compound was quaint and nicely decorated. The whole process was very well-planned. The guide/teacher was entertaining and professional. We prepared, cooked, and ate each dish at a time. Most of the ingredients were pre-measured for us, and the cooking process was highly supervised by the guide, leaving really very little room for students to mess things up. The result was delicious food that seemed to have been cooked by you! You will also receive a recipe book at the end of it, though I have not tried cooking with it. All in all it was a great experience and I do recommend it even for those who has never stepped into the kitchen. Though if you are looking to really learn how to cook Thai dishes, then you should probably look elsewhere."

We were placed in groups of 10 and introduced to our chef before heading out to the market. Besides the expertise of our chef, she also addressed my shellfish allergies without fail.If you want to be taught how to cook Thai food by a wonderful chef using authentic cooking facilities, and then eat your amazingly delicious creations, please choose Silom Thai Cooking School.

All information (VERY detailed) were provided.The class itself was awesome - you have a chance to get to know some tips about thai food cooking and ingredients used. Everything is explained step by step, then you have a chance to cook and taste your dish. The time flies very quickly and you do not realise the class is about to end until you taste the dessert. That was a perfect choice for Friday evening - combination of joy, learning and dinner at the same time.

It was overpriced and we all took turns stirring the single pot as only two burners were available for a group of 10. Then came Silom! We signed up for an afternoon class, everything was AMAZING. Food: delicious. Our teacher: very informative and so so funny. The price: unbeatable. We had individual burners and the opportunity to do everything from making coconut milk to creating curry paste (and of course cooking our multi course meals). We loved it so much we plan to return in a few days for our third class. Do it. You won't regret it!! Just plan to skip a meal or two that day"

There were three options, and we chose the evening class, which did not include a trip to the market to acquire ingredients (the other two classes included the market trip). We walked down a narrow, seemingly sketchy alley to get to the address, only to discover a wonderful cooking facility. We waited in a dining room for everything to be prepared, and then we were called to the next room, where Chef Oat had laid out ingredients and cutting stations for each of us. Chef Oat was informative, took his time, had a great sense of humor, was kind to our children, and really had it going on. (And his English was excellent!). After each demonstration/food prep, we would go to our own individual cooking stations, cook our dishes, return to the dining room to eat what we had cooked, and returned to the neighboring room to have the next demonstration/preparation. Everything was extremely well organized, the ingredients were fresh, and the instruction was terrific. We all received a recipe book at the end, so we weren't distracted by trying to remember how to reconstruct these dishes at home. Lastly, we also took a cooking class in Chiang Mai which wasn't as good, and which did have the trip to the market included. It was fun to visit the market, but it was also distracting because I spent part of the time dodging the speeding mopeds and motorcycles that frequently whizzed by. So...go check this class out in Bangkok!!!"

It started with a visit to a nearby market for grocery shopping which I would not have had a chance to visit by myself. Our instructor was engaging and told us a lot about the different kinds of herbs used in Thai cooking. This was followed by a short walk to the cooking school where we spent a few hours on hands on preparation, cooking, and eating our own creations. The ingredients we used to cook were very fresh (think squeezing coconut milk from coconut shavings with your hands) so the dishes all tasted great!Best part is the instructors are all fun, funny and know how to interact with a class of mostly strangers so it made the whole experience great :)"

You don't really go and buy them, they've already prepared them to save time, but the info you get is very interesting. After a short walk of 5 min you get to the school where they give you time to relax in an airconditioned room. Everything you do (except the cooking itself) is in aircon. They have obviously prepared a lot of the foods already but you still get to do a lot yourself and you prepare the pad thai completely by yourself. Everything is delicious!! They speak good english, so very understandable. You get to eat all the foods (+/- 5 dishes), so I was really full by the end. Def don't eat a big lunch beforehand!In short, extremely friendly people, amazing food, learned a lot about the ingredients and they really try to make you feel comfortable considering the heat in Bangkok.

This was fine for us, and fine for the price we paid, but I think they might want to offer something more than this in the future...Also, the walk to the school was quite interesting. We went on a Friday night and it excluded the trip to the market, which wasn't a problem for us as you can get a bit over-marketed in Bangkok pretty quickly.

There was a gorgeous dining room and different preparation and cooking stations. We made 5 small dishes each and ate them as we went along. My friend and I are complete foodies but novices in the kitchen but we felt the level expected was perfect, we learnt a lot but didn't feel intimidated. Similarly, we were both happy with the 1000B cost, definitely well worth it in our opinion.

Such a lovely and informative person. Her English skill is decent and understandable to assist us throughout the class.The place: Though location wise is strategic in Bangkok, the cooking school is located at a small alley, in a 3 story house (If I am not mistaken). Only stairs are available so better inform the school if you are taking elders with you.The activity: I enjoyed the whole activity starting with the market tour then to the cooking part. I got to see how clean the market was compared to local markets in my country. Ms. Mai was very communicative and shared her knowledge in Thai cooking and ensuring that each of the participants (there were 8 persons in my class: 3 Indonesians, 2 Chinese, 2 UK, and 1 US) received the same attention. The class was so much fun and resulted in a super delicious meals. I joined this class with my mum though she was a bit reluctant at first and knew everything already because she cooks but in the end she was happy to have participated in the class. We left the school with full tummy as well!Note: My mum and I are Moslems so use of ingredients are a concern to us. Luckily they did not show us any non halal ingredients even when we were at the market.Summary: Money well spent! Would love to join again :)"

It was very structured and flowed well. I would recommend to anyone looking to learn about Thai ingredients and ways cook iconic dishes (pad Thai, to yum soup, curry)"

            "review": "Highlight of our Holiday!. I was sceptical at first about booking Silom, as it was by far the cheapest cooking school I found, but with the opportunity to cook the most dishes. My intuition was telling me you get what you pay for, so my expectations weren't high... but I couldn't have been more wrong!! In fact, this cooking class was probably the highlight of our 11 night trip to Bangkok and Koh Samui. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it.We decided to book the 9am class after reading reviews saying that the food market is a bit more lively at this time. At the market we were led by our guide (Chef Pim who was amazing!) to pick up our ingredients and taught about them all along the way. After the market we were led down numerous back streets to the cooking school itself where we were taught to prepare and cook our dishes. The whole experience felt really authentic, unlike I guess some of the other more expensive cooking schools, where you're probably taught in some state of the art hotel/ restaurant kitchen. We sat on cushions in the prep room to chop and prepare our ingredients, and cooked on portable gas hobs with authentic woks and hand-made coconut spatulas and ladles- like proper street food!To cook and eat 5 dishes may sound like a lot, but each portion of food was relatively small so we were left feeling full but not uncomfortable- it was the perfect amount of food for lunch. Upon leaving we were presented with a recipe book containing all the dishes we had cooked that day (plus many more) along with pictures and descriptions of all the ingredients required in order to recreate the dishes at home.To conclude, the staff and facilities were amazing, not to mention the food! I would highly recommend this experience to anyone who has even the remotest interest in thai cooking and food, I guarantee you will have the best time and for roughly \u00a320 a head it really is amazing value for money!!"

A great Thai cooking and eating experience in the heart of Bangkok.I will be honest and say I was nervous about going here as it seemed in the middle of nowhere in Bangkok but my wife had prebooked it and as usual the wife was right and I was wrong as it was brilliant.It is easy to get to basically just hop in a taxi and then where you get dropped there is signs down teh alley ways that tell you where to go, just make sure you get to teh right course as it seemed there was a few in teh same area. Coming home just walk back to the main road and we flagged down a taxi in a matter of seconds.The cookery course was excellent and the people running it were really helpful. A beautiful selection of fresh goods was displayed for us and we cooked our meals with a really nice group of people from all around the world.I would recommend this to anyone wanting to experience a different evening out and learn how to cook some proper Thai food.I was also say if you are going here then have a light or skip lunch so that you have room for all teh food you make :)"

Not only do students learn to prepare and shop for 5 delicious Thai dishes, but the school is somehow both efficiently organized and charmingly personal, and for 1000 baht, a steal.From the market trip to the prep and dining rooms to the outdoor kitchen, every setting offers a must-photograph vignette, with piles of brightly colored vegetables and stacks of vibrant linens and serving ware. Classes are small enough so each student can participate and ask questions, while dietary modifications are handled with care. Other students in our class commented they were so glad to sample a wide range of foods in a tidy environment after falling ill from several other restaurants in the city. The best part of the class is the full-color cookbook we received after enjoying our meal- it exceeded my expectations. I felt able to fully participate in the class knowing details would be outlined later. I am motivated and equipped to cook what I learned- and hopefully return for another of their many course offerings some day!"

First of all we walked from the meeting point to a local market to pick up all fresh ingredients for our food. Oat spent some time talking through all the different ingredients just to teach us how they may differ from our countries and why they use them and allowed us to touch and smell them all to get familiar. Once all the ingredients were picked up, we walked to the cooking class where we talked through what we were going to do and then moved in to a room to prep out ingredients. At every stage Oat was talking us through why and how we do things being very visual and engaging to the multicultural class we were in. He helped cater to the tastes of individual people too, myself being the only vegetarian and two people who would not eat coriander so made special cases in prep for us which was good to see. We made Tom Khai with paste from scratch, Pad Thai, green curry and mango sticky rice, all of which were amazing and tasted so good because of course, part of cooking school is to eat everything you make!! We will definitely be making this again at home with our complimentary cook book and the know how! Oat was amazing teacher, very diligent, friendly, helpful and funny and could not recommend a class with him highly enough!"

To start out, we were sent in groups to the market where our guide pointed out the different ingredients we would be using in class and how to choose whatever freshest and best. We then walked back to the school and began cooking. The majority of the prep work (and all of the clean up) is handled by the competent staff. Students alternate between the kitchen and dining room, learning to cook a dish, cooking it, than eating it. The outcome was some of the best food we had on the trip.

Details of where to meet the chef for the market tour were extremely detailed and easy to follow by public transport or taxi. They even suggested a leaving time, based on traffic and a letter for your taxi driver in Thai to make sure they get you to the right place! Amazing customer service!Every class (except evening classes) starts with a guided trip to a local market to buy the fresh ingredients needed. Your chef explains the variety of vegetables, herbs and spices available as well as their uses, differences and substitute items \u2013 great for when you get home and can\u2019t source a specific ingredient! For all of the dishes we prepared the ingredients and cooked the dish in less than 30 minutes! We always prepared all the ingredients before we started cooking in the extremely hot woks stationed outside and this means your not panicking over chopping something whilst the wok burns.This was one of the best cooking classes we have done anywhere! The level of service from the school was amazing and the instruction/experience was fantastic.

We met our teacher at Chong Nosi at 8:40am and took BTS to Saphan Taksin to start the local market visit. It was raining heavily at the beginning and luckily we were in trainers. Those in slippers got to step into dirty water in the market. We were provided with an umbrella, bottled water, and a basket to take away our ingredients from the shops. We then went to a local home to start our cooking. We prepared the ingredients for each dish on ground floor (air-conditioned), cook the food on 1/F (no air-con), and enjoyed our dish on G/F again. Each of us was treated a Coke. Our food tasted really good, and the teacher chef gave each of us a recipe book. The teacher chef demonstrated how to make Mango Sticky Rice, as a result, we had got an extra dessert after meal. The class finished at ~12:30pm and we left the school with full stomach. Basically, we were very happy with the class, just that (1) the class size wasn't 9 as indicated in the company website (we had 11 of students) and (2) the class wasn't conducted in Silom Cooking School's official place. These doesn't affect our experience, but would be appreciated if we were told of this arrangement in advance."

So it was certainly great value for money!Joo was great - great English, very informative and welcoming. Her staff worked really hard too - as soon as you left a room it would be cleaned and prepared for the next task like magic without you seeing anything.The food and company was great and I couldn't have asked for a better Thai cooking experience in Bangkok for only 1000 baht.Only negative was that it was quite intense and a bit rushed as you are trying to fit 5 meals into the space of 3 hours, but that's understandable seeing as they have two other cooking courses each day to fit in. Therefore an entirely positive experience I'd thoroughly recommend."

Everything was planned to perfection...from the pick-up at the train station meeting point, to the wet-market walk-through, and even the preparation and cooking between dishes was planned meticulously. The cooking school house was beautiful, bright, and very local. A must-do if you're in Bangkok!"

I lived in Thailand for 3 years but never managed to recreate the perfect Pad Thai once I left. After 4 hours with the cooking school team I am ready to serve up a five-course Thai feast anytime. The session begins with a local food market tour before trotting down several sois to find the school, tucked away in the local community and quirkily decorated with a homestyle vibe. It's very much a hands-on experience with amateur cooks getting to chop, pound, stir and taste a wealth of ingredients/produce before taking part in a wok-off with other students as you cook your way through 4-5 dishes. Apart from getting to eat yourself silly, you also get a souvenir recipe book and can buy some kitchen implements on the way out. A fab alternative to the standard tourist trail...and a new skill learned in the process!"

Having found this school on the internet, and looking at the lessons, I decided to take the morning beginner cooking course on a Saturday, with 3 friends. We had a couple of alterations requested (no seafood, one was a vegetarian) which were happily accommodated.Once you've signed up to a course, the school administrator sends some clear instructions with pictures for the meeting point ahead of the course itself. There is even Thai language printouts to show the taxi drivers, if you're really stuck.At the meeting point, we were met by our instructor, Oat, who clearly checked which members of the class had allergies or intolerances (very reassuring!), before embarking on a guided tour of the fresh food market, and then back onto the cooking school.As for the school itself, well, it's clean and tidy, with lots of whimsical decorative touches. There is space for everyone to prepare, cook at individual gas burner stations, and sit and enjoy their food. Except for the cooking stations, which were on the balcony, everywhere else was air conditioned.Everyone is given a chance to prepare the foodstuffs we had just bought from the market, and everyone is sat around the instructor while he demonstrates techniques and teaches the basics of Thai cooking. We all cooked the meals individually, but under the eye of the instructor at all times, who guided us through every step (and prevented us from making any mistakes!).After each meal is cooked, we were allowed time to go back to the dining area to eat the meals we had just prepared, while the school staff prepared the cooking stations and prep areas for the next meal - so no cleaning duties required!!This is a really enjoyable way to learn how to cook Thai food. The \"teaching\" sections are very clear, the instructor was fun and answered all our questions, and the food itself was some of tastiest I had eaten on the entire holiday (even if I had cooked it myself!).If I had more time in Bangkok, I would have loved to return for the advanced courses. I will be back!"

Our group's instructor, Jan, arrived perfectly on time at the meeting point and we were given a water bottle before visiting the local market to go \"shopping.\" Basically we just visited one stall where the ingredients were waiting for us but Jan gave us a thorough overview of each ingredient. The cost covers a tuk tuk ride back to the school. The school is in a very cute 2 story Thai house. Everything is incredibly clean and there is cold drinking water for you to fill up your bottle. Drawers with locks are available for your belongings. During the course, we made our own coconut cream and milk, tom yum soup, green curry paste from scratch for our chicken curry, phanaeng chicken curry, pad thai and sticky rice with mango. Most of the ingredients are measured out for you so the majority of the time is spent learning about each dish, chopping a few ingredients, cooking at the stove and eating! The food is delicious and Jan is very funny and patient with everyone. Her English is great and her instructions are very clear. She also acted as the group's photographer. At the end you get a small cook book that has many other thai dishes. As someone who typically cooks very basic food, I found the class really enjoyable. For individuals that routinely challenge themselves in the kitchen, the course may be a little dull. Nevertheless, the school is run very well and considering it is only about $30usd for 4 hours of instruction, a 5 course meal, tuk tuk ride, etc, I think it is more than worth it for an incredible experience. Also, you can take what you learn back home with you!"

The market tour is a very simple one, bring you to a small market and show you a large basket of food that we are going to cook. It's not a time for you to walk the market (I joined other classes that will give you free time in the market). Then we bring the food back to one of their cooking studio by tuktuk. They will pay the fare so this is an extra Thai experience. We were assigned to a studio that is with two stories - chop and prepare the food on the ground floor and then bring the food to upstairs to cook. And bring the dish back to the ground to eat. Everyone got a big bottle of Coke so you don't need to prepare your own drink. The dessert mango sticky rice is prepared by the teacher. The other dishes are prepared by us but they will chop some meat in advance for you. Be sure not to eat before you come!"

Our instructor, Jay, was fabulous from start to finish, and overall we learned a lot about Thai cuisine and had a great time.1. Silom staff responded promptly to all emails and provided plenty of information for us to easily find the meeting spot/school.2. The market tour was a true tour in that Jay pointed out the ingredients used in Thai cuisine in general, and we were handed the ingredients we were going to use toward the end of the tour (i.e. we didn't select or buy anything). If you've already visited a fresh/wet market, I would skip this tour because you'll get a better look at your specific ingredients during class.3. Jay conducted the tour and class in fluent English. The take-home recipe book is also in English and is a helpful resource.4. The class was very well organized, and in particular I liked that we prepared a dish, ate it, prepared the next dish, ate it, etc., because then you weren't too hungry during class. Jay and the staff set up our work stations for the next dish as we were eating the previous one.5. For us, the tour and class together took about 3 hours (9 am - 12 pm)."

First, it is about half the price of the fancy schools, and probably ten times better. You start out picking your ingredients in the market. The teacher explains what they are and how they are used in Thai cooking. Then with a small group (10 for us) you go to a house or school specially set up for learning how to cook. We made 4 basic dishes which were delicious, and the presentation was so interesting. Everyone is so friendly, and the experience is a definite highlight of visiting Bangkok. You even get a surprise dessert made by the staff, as well as a menu book. Fun for everyone and a great memory. I hope we continue what we learned when we get back home."

Our instructor was Nam and to start the class, she took us to a market to explain the different items that you'll be using that day. There are lots of spices and vegetables that we don't have in Canada so it was really informative. The actual cooking class was a lot of fun and we made several different dishes. We started by making fresh coconut milk and then started preparing tom yum soup. After that, we made pad thai and green curry chicken. There are also a few other dishes such as mango sticky rice that you learn how to make. All of the food that we made was delicious and they weren't cheap about any of the ingredients. For example, two of our dishes had 2 fresh shrimp added while we were cooking! Very clean and well-kept location as well. It was 1000 THB for the 4 hour class and I would highly recommend it!"

We decided to get on a mission to conquer the world of Tom Yum and Green/Red curry and Kafir lime and Galangal and Lemongrass... etc and take a plunge into learning Thai cuisine whilst on our holiday in Bangkok and can I say; taking this class was one of the best experiences we had.The class was fun filled and our teacher/chef Pim was humorous and patient and gorgeous. It was a small batch of 3 couples where everyone got individual attention. Pim answered our questions related to Thai cooking and substitutes to their ingredients. We all made the paste together but cooked separately. We had our own cooking burners where we made our own Green curry and Tom Yum and Sticky rice with Mango.We went for the vegetarian option and there was no differences except of Tofu instead of chicken and prawns. Since coming back to Australia, we have given our newly acquired skills a shot but its nowhere close to what we made on that action packed night. I would presume that we used all fresh ingredients in Bangkok where as here we resorted to coconut milk and creme and tamarind paste from the supermarket shelf and frozen galangal. I have faith that in a few attempts we will achieve our dream of cooking Thai cuisine.Their address is at a convenient location, though it is in a narrow lane but there are clear markings leading to the final destination. Its approx 10mins walk from the nearest BTS train stop. We spent our evening at Bangkok Fashion outlet first as that's pretty close to Silom Thai cooking school and the BTS. They have different options on different days, one can choose days that have dishes you are particularly interested in if you have the liberty of time. Its value for money and if you love Thai food I would definitely recommend this class, you'd be making and gorging on your own cooked Thai dinner."

We chose today based on the menu (Tom yum, Panang, Pad Thai, Green Curry Paste & Green Curry, Mango Sticky Rice). We met the group on Silom road across from the local produce market. Our teacher whose name was Oat, took our small group around explaining what to look for in finding the freshest and best Thai ingredients. We had little baskets each (with complimentary water), and as we walked around picked up our shrimp, fresh coconut, chicken and veg for our meals. We then headed back to the school. There was a few groups cooking today, and I have to say that things were so well run and very efficient. One group would be out cooking whilst the other was in their rooms preparing and learning. They catered to dietary requirements and preferences as well (which was really important to my friend who couldn't eat shrimp, and another man in the group allergic to peanuts).Oat explained to us why the key ingredients are so important, like tamarind or galangal ginger. He chatted to us about his family and own cooking experiences, telling jokes with a clear passion for Thai cuisine and teaching this to visitors. He was also very patient in answering all our questions about the different ingredients or dishes that we had tried across Thailand. The school itself is very clean and welcoming, with the preparation rooms and the dining room both air conditioned and comfortable. You cook outside on gas stove tops with woks. There was only one person per cooking station and we got to eat the five meals as we prepared across the day. This was also really affordable, at only 1000 baht for the half day. We also got to take full recipe booklets and post cards home with us. You can also purchase additionally the aprons and bowls/spoons as souvenirs if you like. I'd really recommend this school, I have a passion for food and cooking so this is something that will stay with me forever! Thank you such much to Oat, and Silom Cooking School! :)"

We have so much fun and it turned out to be our highlight in our Bangkok visit. Going to the meeting point was easy. (They even send you the map and video to guide you to the meeting point.) At the meeting point, the staff introduced the instructor (Mr Jay, very funny person) and bring us to the nearby market for the ingredient class. Then he took us back to the classroom for the cooking section.Overall, Mr. Jay did a fantastic job in guiding us for authentic Thai cooking. his sense of humour brings so much laughter within the class and the food were delicious.Will definitely recommend to family and friends for this cooking class."

Our chef - Nam was very friendly, speaks really good English and very knowledgable about Thai food! There were only 10 students and it was so fun, easy to learn and we made 5 dishes in 2.5 hours! We really recommend this to anyone who wants a great Thai experience in Bangkok! We will definitely come back again!"

Compared to other classes in Bangkok, this one was a bit cheaper (which wasn't why I chose it, but that should be noted anyways.) I chose Silom Thai Cooking school because the diversity of the menu. I'm a bit tired of making Massaman curry and pad thai every class I take! Our chef, Jay, was HILARIOUS and made the experience really fun. We made five dishes, and to be perfectly honest, the pad thai I had was the best I had on the trip--certainly better than what you'd get at most tourist-oriented restaurants--and I made it! I also loved how Jay showed us how to take great food photos, how to plate food, and also was just such a funny guy. Compared to other cooking classes, you do a bit less. I didn't have to measure anything, chop anything more than a few vegetables, and I certainly didn't have to do vegetable carving. If you'd prefer to do those things, there's other classes you should probably take instead. Personally, I don't get much out of having to measure stuff on my own. I'd rather get to the fun part. If there's only one thing I wish we could have done, I wish I could have made my own green curry paste as we all have different spiciness tolerance levels. Other than that, I would absolutely do this again and recommend it to anyone!"

If you are looking for a Thai Introductory cooking course near Bangkok centre, look no further ! we had a blast for the 3h thanks to Koong our chef. She took us quickly round the local market before heading to the school to start prepping and cooking. Koong was funny, relaxed but also giving us the right level of facts and tips. We cooked 3 classic Thai dishes (Tom yan, Pad thai and masadam curry) and we were showed how to make papaya salad and mango sticky rice. After each of the course, you seat down with the rest of the class to eat together and enjoy your creations. The classes are 12 maximum so it doesn't feel like a factory and not mentioning it costs only 1000 baht each !"

            "review": "Wasted Time. In an effort to get out of the hotel and do something different, I thought I'd do something completely different, i.e. take a cooking class. Based in no small part on the reviews that Silom Thai Cooking School has gotten here, that is the school I picked. Big mistake. One thing I do--perhaps too much--is check email when I travel. I hate returning to 700 emails and I hate missing important info, so I check it early and often. The day I was to take the class at Silom Thai was no different. The directions that the owner had given me was that I should arrive at 9:30 sharp, so I arrived 15 minutes early. My first impression was that the school was dirty and disorganized. There were a couple of people on the first floor who may or may not have been attached to the school. They were not overly helpful, but did direct me upstairs to where the classes were to be held. When I got upstairs I was met by two women who did work for the school and when I asked about the class, I was informed that the students were already at the market. Now, this was surprising, as the trip to the market to buy ingredients was supposed to be part of the course. I asked why they left early and why I wasn't notified, to which one of the women replied, \"Oh, no one told you?\" I told her no, they hadn't and she replied \"Oh. Well they are at the market. You can go find them.\" No apology, no \"oops\" nothing other than a suggestion that I go to the market several blocks away and look for a random group of strangers on the off chance that I would be able to figure out which ones were in the class. I thanked them for their time and turned to leave at which the same woman reminded me to go the market, find the people I had never seen and then come back for her class. I smiled brightly and said \"Nope.\" I will say that in a way, I am relieved that it happened this way, because I had seen another cooking school on my way to Silom Thai CS, by the name of Sompong Thai Cooking School and what had been the subject of idle curiosity along the lines of \"Why are there so many cooking schools in this location?\" suddenly became my Plan B. My advice? Skip Silom Thai Cooking School and give serious consideration to Sompong Thai Cooking School."

This was a great activity- if you have a few days in the city and have seen the temples I would strongly recommend this activity. We met along the street and walked across to the market where we learned about the different ingredients in the Thai kitchen- galangal a type of ginger, kefir lime and all the types of curry. Then back to the school to begin cooking. We were two groups of 8- each group in separate locations. The prep room and the eating room were both nicely air conditioned. We cooked outside the room. Staff kept everything running smoothly- cleaning the wok after each dish we prepared. Oat our instructor spoke excellent English and made the morning very enjoyable. I learned that not all tofu is soy based. As we prepared the food we sat on mats on the floor- this may be hard for some people but I am sure arrangements could be made if it is too hard for you to get up and down. We prepared about 8 dishes- learning about curries and coconut milk. Compared to other cooking schools I have gone to, this was very hands on. The cookbook given at the end is a nice souvenir. Excellent value for the money!! Everyone should do this!"

I see this class is located in the same ally way as sompong cooking school which has a more impressive TA review however they are slightly smaller and newer I think. (Welcome to correct me if I'm wrong). For this reason I can imagine they are probably more personal. Silom does classes of 6-8 I think. We were a class of six. All with our own wok and ingredients. Back to sompong, they took very long to respond to my emails and didn't answer the phone and when they did someone answered that wasn't able to assist us as the person that was able to was cooking (I'm just saying things might have got confusing with us speaking English in their defense) that said I'm not comparing the two schools I'm just stating what happened to us. Both get good ratings. And because Silom had much better correspondence and communication we went with them and thoroughly enjoyed it.

The school is in a house where the prep, cook and eat areas are separated indoors and outdoors. Each of us had our own prep and cook stations where we made, pad thai, tom yum goong, red thai curry paste, red curry, fish cakes and mango sticky rice. The entire 4 hours was never dull and everything was very efficient and ran smoothly. You could tell that they have a lot of experience, as everything was so well organized and they were even able to accommodate vegetarians. After we cooked each dish, we were able to eat it before we started the next dish. This is great way to spend an afternoon in BKK. I would highly recommend and go back. The only improvement would be to give better instructions on how to leave the cooking school and back to the BTS, as the map they gave us was slightly confusing."

You do fun things like learn how to make thai spring rolls and sweet chilli sauce from scratch.5. All the recipes work-- our food was all delicious, and super-easy to make. I have no fears about making pad thai, massaman curry, green papaya salad and even sweet chilli sauce at home now.I think Blue Elephant is double the price-- seriously, do not bother, come here instead. Literally the only thing I can complain about is that my dodgy knee hurt when we were sitting on the floor cooking, but everyone else didn't seem to mind."

If you're looking for a professionally run and reasonably priced cookery class in Bangkok, try Silom Thai Cooking School."

I booked this a few months in advance but upon arrival, i changed my plans from the morning to the evening session and this was easily done by the staff at the cooking school.This was a highly enjoyable class and it was the quickest 3 hours of my life. As we did the evening class, our teacher, Yai bought the market to us and went through all the core ingredients within Thai cooking - with the heat of that particular day, I cannot say I was not relieved to not be traipsing the market!The class itself was informative and hands on and we worked with others to complete dishes and we got to taste each dish as we cooked. Might be because we hadn't eaten as we were saving ourselves for the class but I can seriously say it was the best food I had tasted all trip and we had cooked it ourselves! We made tom yum goong soup, thai fish cakes, red chicken curry chicken,pad thai and finished off with mango with sticky rice. We were truly stuffed by the end of the class and was presented with a detailed booklet of all the recipes we made in class and more.I would highly recommend Silom Cooking School and if I had time, I would've definitely enrolled in more classes!"

Then out to the balcony to cook it all up (each person has their own station) and then to a separate room to eat..and, damn, it looks and tastes like the real thing!!!!It is a very well run, entertaining and tasty way to spend a few hours.

We had a class with 8 other people all from different countries (Denmark, New Zealand, Holland, Canada) and us from the U.S. so it was a very basic introduction to Thai cuisine. We had Nam as our teacher with the two from Holland and she was awesome, we felt like Nam truly had a passion for cooking. Since we took the evening class we weren't able to actually go to the market to shop for our ingredients, but they had everything prepared for us and showed us all the different spices, herbs, vegetables, etc. The best part for me was learning about tamarind as I have never known what to do to prepare it for cooking, so those special techniques about what to actually do with some of the ingredients was worth the class itself. We cooked pad thai and massaman curry, but Nam did the work and demonstration for the papaya salad, fried spring rolls, and coconut rice. I would've loved to have been able to actually try the bok bok for the papaya salad, but I understand it would probably take a lot more time to have each person actually cook each entree. I did like the pad thai as it felt authentic to me, we didn't add any of the red coloring or ketchup like they do in America and I really liked it, all the other dishes were average. I should mention I am half Thai and I have grown up with Thai food so I feel like I can tell the difference from authentic and Americanized. All in all I think it was worth the class if you're interested in learning some techniques you can try so you can make Thai food at home."

Our chef clearly described what we should be doing, answered any questions we had and had a great sense of humour - not to mention stressing a solid stone pestle and mortor to its limits :-) following the prep (where I got a little helping hand from others :-) ) we went outside the classroom to cook our meal. This part was surprisingly easy; and the results were amazing!

Just fill in the online form and they will get back to you on email really quickly to arrange a session that you can attend. There were 3 class times daily to choose from and the most popular is the morning class. Both morning and afternoon class involves a market tour. The afternoon class gets to see the vegetable section of the market only as the rest of the market has closed. If you want a full experience of the fresh \u201cwet\u201d market my advice is to book early so that you can get in the morning session. The evening class has no market visit but you still get an explanation of the different ingredients. As for us, we have seen the wet markets before so not so important, we still got the lesson in the different vegetables and herbs that are essential in Thai cooking in the afternoon session. The school is very well run and organized and they even had a bottle of water and basket for us to take on our supervised shopping expedition. We went as a family and had my seven year old son with us. They were so accommodating with our request of non-spicy food and he was able to eat all the food that he made (they just didn\u2019t put chilli in his dishes). He was even able to prepare ingredients and cook like the rest of us, albeit standing on a stool to reach the wok and burner. I think what makes the school is that everyone is involved hands-on in the preparation of ingredients, cooking of the dishes and best of all you get to sit down and enjoy the fruits of your labour. We had a wonderful instructor called \u201cGoong\u201d that was her nickname it is shrimp in Thai. She made the day and the cooking class! She was very funny, engaging, entertaining, knowledgeable and made the whole class fill at ease and experts in Thai cooking (well at least we all thought so). Even the organizer Ms. Mai (I think that was her name) was also very engaging and funny.We would recommend this school if you are would like to do a cooking class in Bangkok.

During the 4-hr lesson, you can experience a shopping trip to wet market and then followed by hand-on experience in cooking 5 different dishes mainly main courses, dessert and chilli paste.You will eat all the dishes you cooked and received a colourful recipe book at the end of the lesson. The class size is about 10 and you have the chance to meet tourists from different countries and it is a really an enjoyable experience in Bangkok !"

When we got back to the school, Ju was very knowledgeable in explaining each and every ingredient. The whole class was very well prepared and neatly displayed. I was very impressed with the way all the dishes and ingredients were laid out for us after every dish we cooked, especially since we had 4 separate meals. It was very easy and simple to follow the instructions, which is great for any beginner. The food was also easy to prepare and delicious to eat. I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about Thai Cooking. Ju also left us with a cook book which I will definitely use!"

Then we had a quick local market tour, and moved to a nice little house, just like a local home. We made 5 dishes (well maybe 4 and a half, but it's good enough) and we finished our own dishes (not sharing with someone or tasting the instructor's dishes, i.e. it's a 5-course lunch). Instructor is funny, speaks good English, gives clear instructions and offers to take enough photos for us. At the end we paid by cash and got a little cook book with the recipes. Conclusion: very enjoyable authentic Thai cooking class at reasonable price, highly recommended."

It was very well priced, I would have paid more for what we did; it was amazing. They provided everything and guided us through the entire cooking experience with each recipe and it was super simple! I feel like I can cook those things again without trouble. At the end, they gave us a recipe book that had everything in it. It included the names and pictures of all the ingredients, including the obscure Thai ingredients that I would have forgotten. Definitely do NOT eat before you do the course, because you get to eat everything that you cook and by the end you're very full! Highly recommended!"

We booked this last minute for our last full day in Bangkok and I am so happy we did as the experience was fantastic! We went for the afternoon course which involved going to the market, which was closed however our lovely instructor Yai(?) went through some of the ingredients that we would need in preparation for our cooking session. She went through all the produce in great detail and with enthusiasm. My Fianc\u00e9 and I are quite keen foodies so found learning about the different types of ingredients and their uses really helpful. Our small group then getting into a couple of tuk-tuk's to where the cooking school was based. The building for the cooking school is very much like a house so felt very personal and inviting. The decor was really cool with kitschy, vintage like trinkets dotted around. We made in total 5 dishes including classics such a tom yam goon, pad Thai and Thai green curry, we also learnt how to make coconut milk and cream the traditional Thai way which was a nice touch as well as learning how to prepare sticky rice. The step to step guide as to how to prepare and cook each dish was informative and our instructor Yai was really enthusiastic, funny and made the whole experience good fun. We looked at doing the cooking course at the Oriental Hotel which was double the price, but I am glad we chose the Silom cooking school and would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about Thai food in a fun, relaxed, homely atmosphere."

After a short trip around the market we were treated to a short Tuk Tuk ride to a very nice house, for our 3 hours of fun. Out teaching had good command of English, and was funny as well, the course was very interactive, and good for children as well. The food was fresh, and we had the task of cooking, pounding, chopping etc to make four dishes, which you get to eat. When I next have visitors it will be on the top of my list to do with them."

Didn't manage to get in contact by phone so sent email and got quick response. Ample information and directions on how to get to the meeting spot. The lady who met us there was not necessarily friendly but rather resolute. But she managed to put all the different groups together in no time, so it was efficient. We were coupled up with some other folks and then our chef for the day, J (or Yai?). She is a very cheerful and friendly woman who speaks excellent English and explains everything. The market tour was a bit of a joke, we spent no more than 2 minutes in a market stall and all the pre-purchased ingredients were divided over our baskets. After that we were put in tuk-tuks because of the rain and swiftly brought to the cooking school.The school itself was in a wonderful building, with different rooms, very tastefully furnished and decorated. The dining room was airconditioned. There was also a preparation room and an instruction room, and the kitchen was an outside, open one (but roofed). Everything was very well arranged and organized, with us moving from one room to another under Yai's directions and the other staff members clearing up after us. But it never felt unpleasant or mechanic. The atmosphere was quite relaxed, there was time for some questions and pictures were often taken. We cooked (and ate) 5 dishes and they were all lovely! We also got a recipe book at the end. I think this activity is excellent value for money and I would really recommend it if you have an afternoon to spare in Bangkok!"

We cooked 5 dishes in total, they were all superb. At the end you also get a booklet of all the recipes that you learned.What I particularly enjoyed, on top of the quality of the food itself, was the whole flow of the day. Being in Thailand you can sometimes expect badly organized tours, late, loose etc\u2026 but this wasn\u2019t the case at all for this class. It was always on time, perfectly organized and tailor-made so that you spend a fantastic 4 hours. It never gets boring, too slow, or too fast, or too much.

The four hours started with the obligatory trip to the market with our chef Jay (nice guy) to check out the types of vegetables and spices we'd be using, then off to the kitchen to prepare our meals. The set-up at Silom Cooking School is up some stairs with two food preparation rooms and a small dining room in a line inside and the gas cooking stations in a line outside. First we prepared a delicious Tom Yum soup followed by a Pad Thai. In the preparation room we sat in a circle on the floor while Jay expanded upon the ingredients and led us through the steps. Each time we finished cooking a course we went to the dining room to eat it. The next two courses comprised a curry and, my favourite, mango and sticky rice. When I'd finished eating that lot, I could hardly move!I know we had a chef overseeing our culinary skills, but you do get a real sense of accomplishment having prepared and cooked the meals yourself. The secret for the school is to provide a teacher who is both skilled in cooking and teaching, but also entertaining. Jay ticked all the boxes - a lovely man with a good sense of humour. At the end of the session we were all presented with recipe book containing the meals we cooked plus others. To summarise, if you like to eat Thai food you really should try to cook it, especially the way the Thai people do. I know you will have fun at this place."

So many people then booked onto further classes and if I'd have had time I would of too. Definitely put a few hours by to take a class and if you have dietary requirements they will cater for you."

There were 7 of us in the group with a mixture of nationalities.We were showed how to make coconut milk and cream and then a number of dishes, which were all delicious, my favourite being the Tom Yam Goong.At the end of the lesson we were given a recipe book.The cost of the course is 900 baht. There are 3 classes a day, I did the evening class which doesn't include a market visit, but they sort of being the market to you, showing you local ingredients and giving you a chance to smell them.All in all it was an amazing experience, I would do it again and I'm looking forward to taking friends and family with me!"

He did a wonderful job of walking us through our dishes and he kept us laughing while we prepped and cooked our food. The class is very affordable (1000 baht) and you leave with a full stomach. They provide you with a recipe book so that that you can make the dishes that you did in class at home. The best food that I ate in Bangkok was the food that I cooked in this class. As far as the facility, it is very clean and they provide you with a locker to keep your personal items in while you cook. The staff promptly met our group at the meeting point and Jay also walked us back to the BTS station afterwards. Prior to the class, they did an excellent job with communicating via email regarding the booking of the class, giving detailed information and photographs about the meeting point and answered questions about the class. If you are going to spend anytime in Bangkok, I would highly recommend this cooking school."

It's simply not like that.I brought my sister and parents to this cooking school and we had a great experience.

After the market, he brought us back to to the school where he went through the preparation and cooking of each meal. Joel was extremely funny, informative, and helpful. It was such a fun experience for the whole family and everyone around. I would highly recommend it to everyone and I would definitely do it again."

The school is so well run that we ended our 3 and a half hour course with 3 minutes to spare. Over the course, we learnt to cook 5 dishes, including Tom Yum Kung, Pad Thai, Deep Fried Fish Cakes, Chicken Red Curry and Mango Sticky Rice, as well as how to make sticky rice, red curry paste and sweet chili sauce. We first went as a group to the local market to get the ingredients after which we were taken back to the school to prepare and cook each of our dishes, which we promptly ate. Our teacher was Goong with her assistant Nam, and she was mindblowing: fun, friendly, insightful, charismatic and deeply knowledgeable about the food as well as an outstanding teacher. We had to resist very hard not to do the evening class on the same day.Try get Goong as your teacher, but I'm sure they're all amazing. Obviously go hungry."

Just fill in the form from its website and the staff will reply promptly with detail of how to getting there and what to prepare. They also pay special attention to allergy or request such as vegetarian menu. Third, the chef and staff were really nice and humorous. They speak fluent English! The 4-hour class is never boring and please, believe me!, the marketing tour was so much fun. Each of us cooked for our own, and you can decide whether the dishes is spicy or not. The decor was so great too (and, very good for photo-taking, just in case you'd love to upload to Instagram or Facebook;P)1,000 baht per person is worth spent!

Going to the market really was a plus as I learned new names of spices and vegetables, and gave a supplementary 'experience' to the life of Bangkok.Of course, the dishes made; pad thai, sticky rice, yellow curry and papaya salad, all were equally delicious, and the very close help given permitted everyone to successfully prepare them. The quality of the ingredients given was perfect, they were fresh and very tasty. We also learned to make a tomato rose which was very fun and a good to impress your friends.We were also greeted with a lot of very delicious Thai tea and pineapple biscuits which were some of the best ever tasted.

They were very accommodating regardless and even invited her to just hang around and watch. Very kind! Our chef, Tango, really knew her stuff & made sure to talk about how we could get certain ingredients in our home country. For 1000baht (about $40 SGD), you get a market tour, detailed cooking instructions, eating everything you cook on the spot & a recipe book of 25 dishes at the end of the class. Plus a humorous and lively chef! Come for a different kind of Bangkok (instead of just shopping)!"

We wanted to reinforce some of the things we had learned on the 1st visit. We asked them to customise the dishes slightly so we didn't do the same ones.We can only say good things about this Cooking School, they always answer our emails prior to arriving & are easy & friendly to deal with. Our classes were 4-5 people, very good instruction from the Cooks (who always seem to have a good sense of humour), very hands on with food preparation & then outside to cook the dishes. The support staff do a great job of cleaning up the mess while you go away & eat the dish you have just cooked!Authentic Thai food with fresh ingredients. Price is reasonable compared to other Operators, some of whom seem to charge excessive amounts. We look forward to our 3rd visit."

I was glad we scheduled our class on our first full day in town, so that for all the following meals we would benefit from our newfound knowledge. Our instructor was nice, funny, and interactive with us. Smelling and tasting all the components gave some dimension to the recipes. Some of the dishes like the mango sticky rice became the group favorite dishes from our entire stay in Thailand!"

They took us to the market to see and pick all of the ingredients that we would be using for the day and took the time to explain to us all of the general elements of Thai cuisine! Afterwards they took us to the school which was in a very unsuspecting area of downtown and it was the cutest little house! We made about 5 dishes altogether under the direction of one of the most colourful people I have had the pleasure of meeting, chef (awesome) Jay!! If you have only one day to do something different in Bangkok, I strongly suggest you spend it at the Silom cooking school! Can't wait to head back to Thailand and do another class!"

I wanted to do a cooking school when we last came to Thailand, but left it too late to sort anything out, on our return trip it was a top priority!We chose this one due to its great reviews and also for value for money; it was a great price compared to many others.Accurate directions ensured we arrived at the meeting point without any hassle and met our guide/chef, Tango.We had a trip to the market and picked up some produce and an introduction to some of the ingredients. Next we walked back to the cooking school which wasn\u2019t too far away. Once back we made and ate all the dishes as per the menu, all of which were great and we could even swap out seafood etc. for those who couldn\u2019t or would eat them (not all schools seem to allow this). You ate what you cooked so you could adjust the heat level to your taste which was good.Tango our chef was fantastic, great fun, very informative and she made the day a great experience. We also did another cooking school while in Vietnam and Silom Cooking School was our favourite.Would recommend and return to do another menu on a return trip."

In the meantime I will continue trying to re-create the dishes at home from the recipe book provided.The only negative I can find is that after the course no guidance was given on how to find our way back to the metro (the group had taken taxis from the market to the class)."

We had our initial reservations about Silom Thai Cooking School because it was one of the cheapest cooking class options out there but signed up anyway because of the great reviews we read online. And we were not at all disappointed.There were about 40 students or so signed up for classes but we were split up into 5 groups of 8 students each. The groups were further assigned to one of the two cooking school locations. The smaller class sizes meant personal attention and the opportunity for more hands-on kitchen work. The class started with a quick visit to the wet market to learn all about Thai ingredients, including a coconut grating demonstration. We were each given a shopping basket to collect the ingredients. Then we walked back to the school, which despite its humble-looking appearance and location down a quaint-looking residential alley, is very efficiently and professionally run.We were first ushered into an air-conditioned waiting room, which doubled up as our dining room while the kitchen helpers prepared the dry kitchen next door. We were then seated in a circle on the floor, in Thai fashion, and taught how to de-vein shrimps, peel onions, prepare our own coconut cream and milk and so on. We prepared the ingredients for each course before cooking them. This helped space out the chopping, cooking and eating, which worked really well for us. The cooking was done along a long walkway instead of a real kitchen, which some people may take issues with, but this only adds to the whole local experience. Our chef, Tango, was not only great at teaching us the basics of Thai cooking but also affable and very funny.We've been to cooking classes all around the world and Le Cordon Bleu it is not but for the price you pay, Silom Thai Cooking School is a true gem. We had Pad Thai the day before in one of Bangkok's top-rated restaurants and the Pad Thai we made at the school won hands down. The other dishes were also stellar! We were also given color-printed booklets of 20+ Thai recipes to bring home. The only regret we had was not having more time in Bangkok to do additional classes with the school."

Food was superb and there was plenty of it - the whole afternoon was organised very efficiently and it would be hard to improve this experience. Well worth the 1000 baht paid directly to them (they only take cash) and I'd suggest its not worth shopping around to save a few baht with a heap of commission then being paid to a booking agent! My 14 year old son loved the experience and I'd say this activity was suitable for kids from 12 and up. All in all highly recommended and the best afternoon we had on our 5 day visit."

Someone came to split many of us into a group of 6 max, and bring us to the local market. The lady explained to us some of the common ingredient used for Thai cuisine and cooking and it's rather interesting. However, expect to see a lot of flies and mosquitoes around the area. The dishes we made on Monday include Tom Yum Goong, Pad Thai, Green chicken curry, a Thai Salad, and Mango sticky rice. It's quite a lot of food, 5 courses. Everyone will be preparing their own dishes and cooking their own small pot of Tom Yum Goong, and so on, so it's rather interesting and fun. After cooking each dish we would return to a little air con room to enjoy what we just cooked, while waiting for the lady to prepare ingredient and set up for the next dish. So you will be eating the 5 courses throughout the morning so make sure you don't eat heavy breakfast or else you won't be able to enjoy what you just cook. It really tasted up to restaurant standard, or even better. By the time we enjoy our last dish i.e. mango sticky it's already 12pm. It's by far the best morning I had in BangkokPayment - I come across this cooking class online in asiaworld. Asiaworld is like an online agent where if you booked through them they will give you a discount. To book directly with Silom cooking school will cost you 1000 baht, but if you book through Asiaworld it claimed to be 990 baht. Not a lot of difference but still it's a discount. However, the Asia world never get back to me, and never confirm my appointment so we end up paying the original price 1000 baht after the class. At the meeting point, I saw many other people who booked the cooking class in advance, and on the receipt it's showing 800 baht only. So I bet if you try harder and book in advance, you could get much better discount. Don't feel quite fair though people are all paying different prices for the same cooking class. Why can't they standardise. Location wise - not particularly convenient as it's not closed to the skytrain. Fortunately taxi fare was cheap from Pratunam area (51 baht one way)"

            "review": "Who knew you could unlock the mystical mysteries of Thai cooking in just a few hours?. The Silom Cooking School, was a perfectly excellent trip into Thai cuisine. The thing I learned about Thai cooking, which should surprise almost nobody, is that if you assemble real Thai ingredients and throw them together in a pot or a pan, it\u2019s going to taste good. Case in point \u2013 the first thing we made was Tom Yum Goong \u2013 spicy sour shrimp coconut soup. Basically, you prep a small pile of ingredients, including the Thai trinity \u2013 galangal (Thai ginger), kaffir lime leaves, and lemongrass \u2013 then you add birdseye chiles, which will sear your soul if used properly, and a few other things like fish sauce, shrimp, and some other stuff (I have already sent home the very helpful recipe book that they gave us so I\u2019m working from memory), and you add a few shrimp, some water, and a bit of coconut milk and you throw it into a wok and cook it for four minutes. That\u2019s it, kids! And let me tell you, this was the best damn Tom Yum Goong I\u2019ve ever had. It was tangy, spicy, and it had all those great Thai flavors that you almost never get at Siam Palace, or King of Bangkok, or King of Palace of Siam, or whatever your serviceable non-Thai-owned neighborhood Thai restaurant is called.Other mysteries were revealed. We made our own coconut milk and coconut cream, which was like finding out the trick of sawing a lady in half. Here\u2019s how you do it \u2013 take a coconut, shred it, add warm water, and squeeze it into a fine mesh colander (the Thais use woven baskets, but who\u2019s got one of those?). The product of this is coconut cream. Then you take the just-squeezed coconut shreds and add more warm water and squeeze it out again. That\u2019s the coconut milk. Crazy, huh? The technique trick I learned about coconut curry is that you combine the coconut cream and the curry paste and reduce that for a while, then you add your protein and the coconut milk (and the obligatory mise en place of spices and condiments) and reduce that for a while, and you\u2019re done. It\u2019s not insipid and watery, like I always make. The whole thing takes ten minutes. We also made our own curry paste. This was really easy, even though we used an old fashioned mortar and pestle. Just throw thai basil, thai cilantro (there are several kinds of both), some big not-so-spicy chiles, some little really spicy chiles, and some other stuff in a bowl (or food processor), and you\u2019re done. Who knew?I will say that our instructor (who used to live, of all places, in Waco, Texas) may or may not have been the Rachel Ray of Thai cooking. He seemed perfectly fine with using canned coconut milk and prepared curry pastes. I\u2019m sure he was right, but when I get home, I\u2019m going full monty with all the homemade stuff.We also made penang curry, pad thai, and sticky rice with mango. They were all shmabulously good, especially the sticky rice, which is now my favorite dessert. That one is ridiculously easy \u2013 steam (don\u2019t boil) some glutinous rice, soak it in sugar and coconut milk, and top it with some sesame seeds. Your guests will think you\u2019re god, and you\u2019ll giggle and titter at how easy to please everyone is."

            "review": "Great Family Activity!. First, let me say that I'm a 51 year old guy with an 18 year old son who's just like me and a wife and 16 year old daughter. So when it was suggested that we go to a cooking school I wasn't overly excited. I mainly hoped my wife and daughter would enjoy it. It ended up being one of the highlights of our trip. There were about 20 people which they divided up into three groups. We had eight in our group with our Instructor Oat. To start they gave us all baskets to carry as we followed Oat around an outdoor market. He explained the differences between the vegetables, noodles, and spices at the market. Next we went to the school where we prepared four different dishes all of which were outstanding. For each dish, we'd start out in one room everyone in front of their own chopping block. The ingredients were all laid out for us. It was very organized. Oat would then explain what to do as we all cut, kneaded and mixed the ingredients. Along the way, he would explain the differences between different types of peppers curries etc. He was very easy to understand. I believe he said he had spent time at Baylor University in Texas. After the initial prep work, we'd all head outside where they had eight woks on gas burners all set up and we'd set about cooking. Everyone prepares their own dish. As we'd cook, he'd come by and ask if you wanted shrimp, chicken, pork etc. Once it was finished, we'd head into the little dining area to eat the food we had made. This cycle repeated four times. Finally ended with some sticky rice and mangoes. I think the whole class lasted about four hours and cost about $30 per person. I can always tell when my family enjoys doing something. That was day three of a two week trip to Thailand and Laos. We did A LOT of stuff. By the end of the trip we were still all talking about the cooking class."

            "review": "Fab introductory course for Thai cooking. My girlfriend and I attended an afternoon class at Silom Thai Cooking School. My g/f had previously taken part in a course at Silom two years ago but insisted we should go back as she enjoyed it so much the first time around. We went to the market to start off and find out about the ingredients that we would be using over the course of the afternoon. This was very interesting. We got to run through step by step which ingredients were used for each recipe and also get a feel and smell of some of the ingredients. Great idea to set this part at the market where the wheeling and dealing for these Thai ingredients takes place in traditional every day life.We walked on to the Silom cookery school and made a start. Our tutor was very informative and made us all feel at ease. We were lucky because on the day there was only 4 in our individual class whereas there is usually approximately 10, not that this should put anybody off. For me especially. as a pretty poor cook, the tutor made me feel relaxed and explained everything fully in clear English. We touched on the preparation and ingredients involved for each dish and then took part in the cooking which was the really fun part. The stoves are piping hot so be cautious but it means the individual meals can be cooked effortlessly in two-three minutes. You then go into what was dubbed the 'winter' room to enjoy what you have produced and take souvenir photos. From the 3 hours we were on the course we made Tom Yam soup, red curry, Thai fish cakes, Pad Thai and our desert was made for us to enjoy at the end, sticky rice and mango. It was all scarily delicious!!My one small criticism and maybe an idea for the future was perhaps the desert could have been demonstrated as part of the course and not just presented at the end. This should not detract from what was an afternoon well spent. Prices for our course was 1000b per person. For what you received food wise alone was reasonable. You also are presented at the end of the course with a recipe book for all meals made on the day and many many more! Overall, a truly great afternoon out and you also save yourself buying lunch and dinner!"

If you're a very serious chef who loves doing their own prep then this course is not for you. If you're a amateur cook who wants to learn some of the fundamentals of Thai cooking in a fun environment then I would recommend this class. First up they take you to the markets. Very interesting as they explain all the ingredients. Next they take you back to the cooking school. As other reviewers mention, some of the prep is done for you whilst you do other things. In all we made 4 dishes - Tom yum soup with prawn, pad Thai, red Curry and fish cakes with sauce. There was also sticky rice with mango which we had for dessert. I didn't include it as a dish we cooked because it is a simple dish that requires the rice be soaked, steamed and served with mango. In any case, all of the food we cooked was crazy delicious! (Aroy mak mak!!!/\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22 \u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e21\u0e32\u0e01!!!)Our instructor \u0e01\u0e38\u0e49\u0e07/G\u00fbng (which also incidentally means prawn) was amazing. Very friendly and knowledgeable, my girlfriend and I both though she was delightful. In summary, great place to visit if you have a morning/afternoon free, want to have a amazing time learning about Thai food and love eating! Come hungry!"

            "review": "Fun and delicious experience for beginners. We did the morning class because we wanted to do the market visit and had a great time! I think there are at least 2 different school locations and depending on the number of people, you will be broken into smaller groups and sent to different markets & school locations than the one listed on their website. We were sent to the one near Saphan Taksin Station where we could see a real local market (several locals were haggling and buying while we were there). We were also lucky enough to get the (newer?) cooking school where the preparation room was in a lovely decorated house (full of cute cooking/food-themed artwork on the walls and shelves) where we had comfortable tables/chairs to work, so we didn't prep on the floor like some of the other reviews say. Our teacher Tang was friendly and made jokes throughout the entire session. The pipelining was very efficient so when we had finished cooking something upstairs with the woks, the downstairs was already prepped with the ingredients we needed to chop for the next dish. We never felt like there was a lag or that we were too rushed, and we had more than enough time to enjoy each hot dish after cooking it. However, this is not a class for someone who is serious about learning how to prep/cook these dishes after going home or are hoping to discover special techniques for improving the taste. As many other reviews say, you do not really prepare anything from start to finish. I did this class more for the fun hands-on experience. You get to do a lot of traditional \"prep\" work that even Thai people rarely do anymore including mashing up various ingredients in a stone mortar to make homemade green curry paste (much more exhausting than it looks) and squeezing out fresh coconut cream and milk from coconut meat. The food we made was some of the best we had in Thailand. Be sure to go hungry because you will end up eating a lot. Our group was a total of about 9 people, so we didn't feel cramped at all. Everyone was super nice and from different backgrounds, so it was also fun talking to people during the \"eating breaks.\" Highly recommended for people with limited time in Bangkok but want to try out a Thai cooking school. We even get a small recipe book with all the dishes we made and some others. For 1000 baht, this was a fun, stimulating, and very cost efficient experience!"

Of the five dishes we supposedly made, we only participated (made nothing from start to finish) in making three things. If you are looking for a very light sort of cooking experience then this is fine. If you really want to do make entire dishes, including doing a lot of the prep work, then save your money for the excellent schools up in Chiang Mai.I hated sitting on the floor for the little prep that we did. The woks were lined up along a balcony, staring at the neighbour's laundry. Not aesthetic or pleasant.I'm only glad that I wasted 1000 Bhat and not more."

Some people have said things are prepped for you and marked the course down... It's actually just that some ingredients are measured out for you (which is normal at a cooking class) or things which take hours (e.g. sticky rice) are pre-made so don't let that put you off. You get to prep everything and learn so much about how Thai people prepare food... even the effort put into pastes! And yhe food we made was delicious.

It is really convenient that there is an evening class because the morning class does take a good portion of your day so I like how they also offer this. Silom was very responsive to emails regarding meeting location, menu, everything, really. Upon arrival at the metro meeting place which was easy to find (they also provide a youtube video with directions of where to meet and how to get all the way to the cooking school), we were greeted by Koong. She was also our teacher. She was so friendly and had a wonderful sense of humor. Our class had quite a few requests actually, from people who only eat seafood, strict vegetarian and me, an alternate menu since this is the second time I've attended the class and have already cooked the items on the menu everyone else was making. Koong remembered each and everyone's requests and never failed to give us the appropriate attention, even if we were making something different from the majority of the class. The class went smoothly. The way it works is that you prepare and cook one meal all together as she describes to you the ingredients you are using, then you eat it in a comfortable, air conditioned room (that has lockers for your belongings as well as a bottle of water for everyone upon your arrival). I've attended other classes where you cook all dishes then eat them all at the end but here, you eat each dish after you cook it. It is good bec it is still hot and fresh and you can concentrate on the flavors of only that dish. There were a few dishes like the minced chicken salad and mango sticky rice that she just shows you how to make instead of making yourself which makes sense because I think it would be too difficult to make an individual size (but I say that coming from an Asian family where everything is made to feed an entire village).As I mentioned, this was my second time to visit this cooking school and I would go back because of how smooth it work and how great the instructors are. Last time I also had a witty and friendly instructor but I also think this reflects the Thai people and their personality. I only gave 4 stars however because it didn't seem that the food was as amazing for me as it was last time. Obviously that is in my hands since I'm the cook but I opted for the fried rice since I have already made Pad Thai and I found it too salty with the fish sauce, oyster sauce and soy sauce all together. Maybe the second time isn't as an exciting an experience. I still highly recommend it nonetheless."

Our teacher was lovely & made adaptations to accommodate my nut allergy & my partner's vegetarianism. Nice environment. Loved the cook book to take away. You sit on the floor for a lot of it so dress accordingly & maybe contact them beforehand if you have a back problem. The market tour aspect was the only thing that could be improved. It wasn't a working market which makes it a lot easier for the teacher to talk to you about the ingredients but I'd liked to have found out how to buy things and for what price in a real market."

She was very knowledgable and answered all of our questions. The recipes were delicious, and we received a really nice recipe booklet at the end of the class that included not only the recipes that we cooked in class, but also lots of other recipes and information about Thai ingredients.I travel frequently and have taken several cooking classes in different places, and this is the one that I've enjoyed the most. And it's a great deal--only 30 baht for six recipes! I highly recommend this cooking school."

The class itself was excellent and Oat, our teacher, was brilliant. He explained about all the different Thai ingredients and was great fun. Some dishes we made individually and others, like the green curry paste, we made as a group, such was a great laugh. Water and a cola was provided in the dining room and at the end of the evening we got a very good quality recipe book too.The only reason for the missing 5th star was the slightly scary arrival! We found our way to the school, thanks to the maps and signs provided in the booking email, but on arrival and with very little explanation, were told to get onto the back of the waiting mopeds who then drive us off, without explaining where we were going or why. It turns out there had just been a slight mix up regarding group numbers and the school were very aplogetic and we didn't miss anything, but as a new visitor to Thailand, moped rides to unknown destinations werent top of the agenda!"

            "review": "A very well-thought out and delicious experience!. I had a fabulous time with the tiny exception of the meeting at the train station. It took a while for our chef to call back and forth to the office to figure out exactly how many people we were supposed to have, and they decided to give us BTS train tickets to another studio a couple stops away at Sathorn (same company, just another location because the Silom studio was full) - it was fine because they paid for our tickets but I was a bit annoyed because I had actually just come from the Sathorn station so it was a waste of time and money.As soon as we got to the cooking location at Sathorn, though, everything was friendly and wonderfully well-planned and executed. There were separate areas for eating, prepping ingredients, and cooking. For example, we prepped our ingredients for pad thai, then we went upstairs to individual woks and burners, cooked our food, and went downstairs to eat. When we were ready to make the next course, the green curry, we went back to the prep area and saw the staff had already cleaned our stations and knives and set the ingredients for green curry on the table. When we went upstairs to cook, the staff had also cleaned our woks and spatulas so that we were ready to make the curry. It was really a well-oiled machine.Aey was an awesome teacher who was energetic and funny and really communicated great knowledge and passion about food. We had done an evening class which is a bit cheaper but omits a trip to the market for shopping, and as a substitute, Aey had laid out beautiful arrangements of the ingredients and taught us about their different uses and origins and let us smell each unique herb. She also used our cameras to take pictures of us at various points during the class, which was great.The food we prepared was truly excellent - some of it was even better than what I had experienced at home (my parents are Thai) or in Bangkok. Tom yum goong was one favorite - the flavor was amazing and I actually feel like the recipe was easy enough to execute at home. The green curry with freshly-made paste was incredible, as I've had delicious green curry before, but the fresh paste flavor was something new and bright and divine. It had a ton of ingredients, but fortunately we got a recipe book to take home, so perhaps I'll give it a shot again :)This cooking school is a great value, very educational, and very yummy! I can't believe I ate everything I made!! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this."

            "review": "Solid introduction to Thai cooking. I've done two and half cooking classes at Silom. I've enjoyed my time here and liked interacting with the staff. What to expect.... One or two students will always show up late, so the group will probably leave without them. Next, a market tour. It's briefer, but you can see, and buy, some of the vegetables you'll use later in the class.Then you will go to the school and begin preparing dishes. There are 3 rooms you'll use. One is for sitting and eating, another is for food prep and finally there is room where you'll be cooking. The cooking room is more like a hallway and all the skillets will be set up in a row. The instructors will take you through 5 dishes in a normal class, but I have opted to take some private time with instructors to learn dished not taught in the class. You have this option, if you are willing pay extra. Out of the 5 dishes, you will really study 3 hard. The other two dished will be heavily assisted by the staff.After cooking each dish, you will retire to the first room to eat. So you'll be prepping, cooking and then eating. Repeat, repeat, repeat.... The entire class will work together to mash ingredients in a mortar. This will probably be for a curry. At the end of the class, you will get a nice color booklet with the dished you learned, and lots more. If you like the dishes you cooked, I recommend asking the staff to direct you to the closest super market. Buy the harder to find ingredients. The class will be fine for people with little cooking experience. Most advanced students will probably enjoy as well. Definitely an enjoyable afternoon in Bkk. Maybe, like me, you'll develop a skill for cooking Thai food and impress your friends back home ;)"

Our teacher was knowledgeable, engaging and a delight to learn from. The facilities were new and clean. The cooking process was great fun, and the food we ate was the best Thai I've had over the years (probably due to no MSG). The only thing I was not so happy about, was how close we were placed next to each other at the cooking stations - too crowded. So close, actually, that when we were frying the eggs for the pad thai, the oil from my neighbor kept splattering a bit up my hand and arm - nothing serious, but did sting a wee bit. More space between cooking stations would be appreciated. Aside from that, a most enjoyable experience. Would sign up for another class on next visit, but for a different menu of course."

My fiancee and I were in Thailand for a 13 day tour around the country, and we began our trip by taking a class with Silom Thai cooking school on the first afternoon of our arrival in Bangkok. Beginning our trip with this class turned out to be an amazing way to begin our trip. The chance to visit the market and then prepare 5 different dishes helped us develop a thorough understanding of Thai cuisine, and it allowed us to enjoy even more each and every meal we shared for the rest of our trip, as we better understood the ingredients, preparation and presentation that was put before us, whether we were eating in a fancy restaurant or from a roadside food cart in a market. The school itself is very well organized, there was great communication with them from the moment that we made our first inquiry and right through the entire booking process, and we recieved an email with very detailed directions that made finding the RV very simple. Our chef was Koong, an enthusiastic and talented lady that was proud to teach our group of 8 about the cuisine of this beautiful country. We began with a very informative trip to the market where we learned so much, and then after a short walk, we got down to business, and Koong led us through the preparation of a soup, salad, Pad Thai, Green Chicken Curry, and Mango with sticky rice. We were coached through the preparation of each dish, using traditional methods and pure fresh ingredients, and then went outside to the woks to prepare each dish under Koongs careful guidance. The highlight was getting to eat each of our creations, so my one piece of advice is to arrive hungry, as you will get a chance to eat alot of great food.  The school itself is clean and very well setup and organized. A nice room with tables to eat, with lockers to store your possessions, and a great classroom where we sat on the floor and prepared our ingredients before heading outside to cook on the line of woks. All of the staff was friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable, and I can say without any doubt that when we are back in Bangkok we will once again be visiting this great school to learn more about cooking this suculent cuisine. We even left the class with a great Thai cookbook, full of great information, and since coming home have purchased a wok and found a local store that stocks most of the Thai ingredients, and are continuing to practice all that we learned from this great school.  Highly recommended and without a doubt, one of the highlights of our trip."

The entire set up was done brilliantly with a lot of prep done ahead of time but not too much so that you didn't feel like you weren't actually cooking the meals.

Then, we would take our ingredients and carry them to our woks. After spending a few minutes cooking, we would proceed to the dining room to eat our meal.

The instructor was friendly and very informative and we all had a great time! Many people in the class were repeat customers! Would definitely come back!"

My boyfriend and I have just finished an evening class with Tang, and both came out raving about how great it was and what a wonderful teacher Tang was (informative, friendly, funny!) fWe made pad Thai, massaman paste, massaman curry, papaya salad, spring rolls and finished off with a mango sticky rice - and we got to eat each dish we made too! It's fair to say that we left with very full bellies, as well as a cook book each. I would highly recommend this course, and it's such good value for money too. Thanks guys!!"

Most of the students packed up the extras to take home...Not my travel companion and I! We ate it all!!! Delicious, educational and fun!

Our chef \"shrimp\" brought us for a market tour where she introduce the ingredients that we are going to use for our dishes, and some of the unique vegetables found in Thailand.With our marketing basket filled with ingredients, we took a stroll back to the school and start our lessons. We cooked green papaya salad, mussaman curry, mango with sticky rice, pad thai sai kai and spring roll. They accommodated our request for an extra dish, red rubies with a small fee (prebooked through email as they need to prepare the coconut). Our chef is cheerful and makes our lesson fun. To our surprise, she is also able to name some of the ingredients in mandarin. We enjoyed our lesson and foods. The only dish which I dislike is the mussaman curry which we prefer our sg style curry.Overall, it is an enjoyable experience and a very full stomach filled with delicious foods cooked by ourselves."

            "review": "A great starter class. Very affordable, accessible, friendly.. While visiting Thailand, I most definitely wanted to take a Thai cooking class. There are many good cooking schools in Bangkok, and I chose Silom Thai based on reviews. I was very happy with the results. the class was easy to book. I simple sent an email inquiring about availability. I heard back relatively quickly and then all I needed to do was confirm that I understood the instructions on how to get to the meeting spot, and that I was indeed going to attend. Payment is made at the end of class and is 1000 Baht, which is a very affordable price to cooking classes. The meeting spot was quite easy to reach from the Sky Train (BTS) station. It was a full class today and everyone was very friendly. Our instructor Goong met us and took us to the market where she gave us a short introduction to Thai herbs and vegetables. We toured the market further and bough ingredients for the five dishes we would make. We got to see the stand where they grind coconut to use for making fresh coconut milk and cream, some lovely seafood stalls, and other assorted stalls. My only regret is that I didn't ask more questions while at the market. After the tour we walk to the school, and start prepping. We started by making fresh coconut milk from the ground coconut we bought, and Goong explained how we would steam the sticky rice for the desert dish. After that we all started prepping for the fist course. Hot and Sour shrimp soup. At this point, I should note that we prepare the food communally on the floor. If you have trouble sitting on floor for long periods of time or trouble getting up off the ground, this could be uncomfortable to you. They do provide cushions and a short stool if you need one. After prepping the ingredients, we step outside to the gas stoves and start cooking. Then we take our dish to the dining area and enjoy. We repeat this process for the next 3 dishes. And the final dish, dessert is served after we finish our fourth dish. If you are looking for a class that you prepare everything from start to finish with no guidance, this is not the class you are looking for. But in my opinion the real value here is the knowledge of the instructor. Take advantage of it and ask questions and Enjoy!"

They are really amazing. For 1000 bahts (much cheaper than other schools) they start giving you a basket with a bottle of water and taking you to the market. I live in the neighbourhood and I assure this is a real Thai fresh market where everybody does their daily shopping. The introduction on Thai vegetables is fantastic (and necessary!) and after that you go back to school where you have a nice air-conditioned waiting lounge and the cooking preparation room. The actual cooking takes place at the stove at the balcony. You do get to chop, clean, pound and cook almost everything and you eat every dish as you finish cooking it. Teachers speak amazingly good English and are hilarious and very entertaining. Your three hours fly by and you wish you could start all over again. The food is some of the yummiest I have had in Thailand. First time we cooked Pad Thai, Spring Rolls, Som Tam, Masaman curry and fried banana. The second time, they made sure I cooked different dishes so it was Tom Yum, Fried rice, Fruit salad, Red curry, Sweet mango with sticky riceWithout a doubt, a must do in Bangkok and an amazing time :)"

Our instructor Coong was not only hilarious, but also very fluent in English and she even spoke a few words Dutch. The rest of the team is great as well.

The teachers were able to inspect each person's progress very quickly and easily.- Each person gets to cook their own dish so it's very hands on.- We all received a lovely recipe booklet at the end.- All 5 dishes were absolutely delicious!Cons:- Only one. Prep was done on the floor. Although it was very clean and I didn't have a problem with it, I noticed that not all students could sit crossed legged on the floor for too long. So for elder potential students, this may pose to be a challenge. Also, if you're wearing a mini skirt...I'm already looking at going back for another class. I highly recommend this cooking school!"

He met us at the BTS station and walked us to the school. Straight away he was very friendly and we could tell he was passionate about cooking Thai food. When we got to the school Jay taught us about Thai ingredients and showed us how to prepare them before helping us cook our own Thai food. He is a very skilled chef. The menu is excellent; there is so much food and a lot of different dishes so you definitely get your moneys worth!The first dish we made was Tom Yum Goong (spicy sour shrimp soup) followed by Pad Thai (fried noodle). Then we made Pha-neang Nuea (Pha-neang curry with chicken) and green curry paste to go in our Geang Khew-wan Gai (green curry with chicken). Because you cook the dishes yourself they can be seasoned to your own taste, which is good because I\u2019m not very good with a lot of spice. My personal favourites were the Tom Yum Goong and the Pad Thai, although they were all really good. Dessert was Khao Neow Ma-muang (sweet sticky rice with mango), which was also delicious.Silom Thai Cooking School is one of the best things we did in Bangkok and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun, cultural experience with some great people in a fantastic city."

Definitely one of the best in the league!! We booked the cooking class online and everything was stated clearly with different menus of the day (many selections of dishes) and the price is inclusive of return transfer to/from hotel (we met at a meeting point), a tour around the market and getting to know the types of ingredients that will be used in every single dish that will be cooked later and is really worth it! Learning to cook 5 different dishes and eating it right after was fun! Best part is that, everything was taught from scratch and we had to do everything including washing, cleaning, cutting up the ingredients and cook and transform it into beautiful, delicious, tasty dishes!! The stations were very clean, organized and the chef is fun and engaged with all of the participants. No regrets joining this!!"

If you are interested in Thailand cooking at all and are looking for something to do while in Bangkok, this is well worth the time. Both times we cooked 4 items then ate them. First you go to a market to collect most of the items you will need to do the cooking. Because I had been to the class about 6 months ago they took special care to make sure that I made a couple of items that were different from the rest of the class. Then at the end they give you a nice recipe book of the things you make. The instructors are a lot of fun and patient answering any questions you might have.Again if you are looking for something to do while here in Thailand that is very authentic and are interested in food and cooking, this is an excellent class. Tell them Ron recommended it to you."

Our instructor was Non and he was funny and provided good instruction. We learned how to cook traditional Thai dishes such as pad thai and chicken curry. They did a lot of the prep work of the ingredients beforehand and for some of the dishes (like making the curry paste and frying the bananas), Non did most of the cooking while the students observed. For this reason, I'd say that it is not the place for serious chefs who want to do all the hands on preparation and cooking (hence my 4 star rating), but for me and my daughter, it was perfect. We didn't get too bogged down on chopping and preparing and I was happy to let Non do the deep frying of the bananas and spring rolls. So, if you want to learn the basics of cooking Thai food, not spend too much time prepping and pay a lower price than some of the other schools out there, this is the place for you."

Sanusi the owner is a very friendly and welcoming individual and did everything to make us feel comfortable whilst we waited for a torrential downpour to pass. Situated off Si Lom Road down one of the side roads (No. 11 I think). You pass another cooking school on the right before you get to Silom cooking school so just keep walking and follow the signs. The cooking lesson itself was a little disjointed. Lots of prep already done for you, delivery of the session was pretty slow (mainly due to a German family with two kids who received lots of attention). All of the prep work and \"teaching\" takes place on the floor, not very comfortable to be honest. Jay, the instructor, seemed to be in a hurry to get somewhere and the \"sticky rice and mango\" dish was done for us with no input from us and the green curry paste was not brought together enough, the result being a very \"rustic\" paste with huge chunks of ingredients. The Tom Yum soup tasted fantastic and was by far the stand out dish. Definitely worth a visit and if you book directly you can save money as opposed to booking through a hotel."

The students were involved in some basic peeling, cutting and grinding which was just as fun too! We made 1) Tom Yum Gung, 2) Phad Thai, 3) Papaya Salad, 4) Masala Curry, 5) Mango Sticky Rice. All of them are so delicious! Be careful of the small chili, it got into my eye and I can't stop tearing. Horrible!

As i loved thai food a lot it was great to have the opportunity to learn how to cook the most famous dishes pad thai, tom yam soup, green curry, minced chicken salad and mango sticky rice. It was nice to learn how to make the curry paste from the scratch, as the curry paste you can buy in europe is expensive and always comes with fish sauce in it, which is not great if your guests are vegetarian. Everything was fresh and clean, which i think is important when you're trying to cook in asia. I appreciated the fact that we didn't have to take notes or anything, we were given a tiny cooking booklet at the end of the class, which included all the dishes we cooked and many more. As BKK was my first destination, i didn't want to take along a lot of heavy things, so the size of it was great! The chefs were fun and thought us really well. The best thing is eating your fresh, self-made thai food! Enjoy!"

I highly recommend a cooking course for anyone visiting Thailand. We took this course on the last day of our two week trip and I left realizing I should have taken it on the first day I arrived; we learned so much about not just the foods we cooked, but about dining in Thailand in general, how to pick a good restaurant, understanding the exotic fruits and vegetables of the market, identifying fresh vs. old seafood, it goes on and on.We emailed the day before and they confirmed our reservation very quickly and sent very detailed instructions for where to arrive in the morning. We went on a brief market tour which was very fun and informative. We then made a short walk back to the kitchen, which seemed to just be a converted home, not really an industrial restaurant type space. Which was fine by me. We then cooked the pre-set menu one by one, which included tom ga soup, green curry paste and then green curry chicken, fresh spring rolls with freshly made chili peanut sauce, mango and sticky rice, and pad thai. I think on different days they have different menus. I also asked for a khao soy recipe, which they emailed me a few days after. The instructor was very nice and very funny, and did a great job involving everyone and helping us to get to know the other random people that were in our class. The food was delicious as well. Everything was top notch, very highly recommend. Oh, and this was the least expensive of the 4 or 5 other Bangkok cooking classes i took. Might have been a little shorter, but I didn't feel like i was \"rushed\" through any of the lessons, it was exactly the right length for a casual course."

He took us through a near by market telling us about the stuff their and what we were purchasing. We witnessed a last bartering for a real live chicken as another was beheaded and plucked. We then went to the class room/prep room. As we were prepping dishes jay was really good about letting us know what equilivent ingredients we could get in canada or the states. We prepped, cooked and were professionally served our dishes. While we were eating the prep room was cleaned and the new ingredients were set out. Jay was helpful by taking pictures while we were cooking.

The directions they provided for me were personalized and even included a video to ensure that I had no doubt I was in the right meeting spot. I arrived 20 minutes early just to be sure I was on time and the chef was already there waiting for me.We began promptly at 6 and Ott (I know I am spelling this incorrectly) walked us through all the ingredients we'd be working with. He gave us so much insight on the different variations of basil, ginger, rice (did you know there are over 6,000 species of rice??). Even the most knowledgable cooks in the class learned plenty of new information. The class flowed well, we were each preparing our own meals therefore we were able to cut, chop, and make our dishes ourselves (the best for of learning in my opinion). Most importantly, the food was delicious! Best Tom Yom Soup I've tasted in a long time. We thought the entire staff was friendly, courteous, and hilarious.

We made 5 courses; spicy and sour soup, spring rolls, chicken/shrimp pad thai, green curry chicken/shrimp, and mango sticky rice. Prepping all of the food was really fun and educational. Oat did a great job explaining everything about the ingredients. The rooms where we would prep and eat were nicely air conditioned to get out of the hot Bangkok heat but the stoves were outside. It was okay because we really weren't at the stoves for too long. My husband is the farthest away from a chef who can barely boil pasta and managed to make all 5 courses without cutting a finger off, setting the place on fire, and/or manage to get food poisoning so if you are concerned about not being good enough, don't sweat it! Our chef Oat was hilarious and made the class so much more enjoyable. When we were trying to catch a cab back to our hotel when class was over, we had a cab driver try to scam us and Oat observed the whole thing and went above and beyond and helped us get onto the sky train and get back to our hotel okay.

We met up at the metro station and walked to the market where we started learning about, and collecting, the ingredients we would be using in the 5 dishes we prepared.Details abound throughout the experience. No time to take notes though, too many dishes to prepare and consume. Don't worry, you'll get a cookbook at the end which we used to capture the stored info we had collected all day.The staff help you understand what ingredient to buy in Thailand before you return, and also, which substitutions can be made in your own kitchen."

The spot on the street where you meet up with your group was a little confusing. However once a couple girls from England arrived, and another girl from the States (we all had a 'lost look' on our faces) it was clear that we were in the right spot. Sure enough our instructor showed up and split us into groups and were were then off to the market. They explained all the ingredients were were going to be using that day. The instructor was very clear and patient. At the end of the class we had all made some VERY tasty Thai dishes!!"

It is more hands-on and you work together on the prep work and then cooking the food together. Prep work is nice because you get to chat with Jay who is excellent and will teach you all about Thai food, cooking techniques, and so on. He's very funny, knowledgeable, and will show you how to make the food look great and taste great at the same time. I find the cost to be very reasonable compared to other cooking classes as well. You have the option of going to a market with Jay before the cooking begins and I recommend you do it. This way you will get to see all the different herbs and vegetables that are important for Thai cooking. Very positive experience."

On arrival we were shown around a local food market and picked our ingredients to cook with under the supervision of our competent and friendly chef Oatmeal. We cooked 5 dishes which were some of the tasiest things we ate in our whole time in the country. The class was relaxed and fun but also well organised and slick.

The class is meant for beginners and those with little knowledge of Thai cooking so everyone can take it. There is a quick market visit to give you a feel for how Thais shop, and also intro to the various ingredients you will cook with. During the course, you will cook five dishes - and eat them - so best cone with an empty stomach. Fast, simple to cook dishes that can easily be made at home ... The Chefs who teach are fluent in English and make the course terrific fun. Chef Ort was especially great."

The instructor showed us step-by-step instructions, taught us about the local Thai ingredients and told us the alternative ingredients that we could use in our own countries if the Thai ingredients weren't available. We cooked a total of 5 dishes but everything was from scratch including the coconut cream, curry paste and sweet chilli sauce. The food we cooked was authentic and delicious. The cooking school staff were all extremely friendly. I was particularly impressed by the clear instructions we got sent about how to get to the cooking school, including a letter written to Thai to give to the taxi driver to tell them where to take us. The cooking school has a very relaxed atmosphere yet still was very well organised. The price was very reasonable at 1000 baht or around $30AUD. I would definitely recommend a cooking class while in Bangkok."

Then we started preparing the ingredients including Masaman curry paste and cooking each of 5 dishes.. The recipes were easy once you prepared the ingredients and, knowing that it would be difficult to find some of them in the US, the instructor was careful to point out which one were optional and/or suggested alternatives. The food was delicious and we had more than we could eat. We had such an educational and entertaining evening that we chose to attend another class at the end of our tour.."

Firstly and customer service from Ms My pre tour was faultless, quick to confirm bookings and provided ample information to get to the meet spot! Be sure to arrive on time! Next our cooking instructor 'amazing J' was so knowledgable, humorous and personable that he made the experience even better than it otherwise would be. The quick market tour was great to see some different thai ingredients, and J's explanations were also quite informative. A lot of preparation is done on advance to allow us to see the preparation of the tricky bits first hand while still being able to enjoy four courses in just three hours. I really liked the format. We cooked one course then ate it, then cooked second course before eating it and so on, so we could taste everything without getting too full and without wasting our food. We did Tuesday set a and I cannot believe how tasty my cooking was, I certainly surprised myself thanks o the tips and assistance provided. Do yourself a favour and book this course I'm sure you will surprise yourself also. The actual cooking is done outside however most of the prep and eating is in an air conditioned room so it's quite comfortable. The set up is homely and basic but completely adequate for a comfortable and thoroughly enjoyable cooking adventure. Do this if you like thai food and want some skills to replicate the true thai taste at home, I can't wait to practice my new skills for friends and family back home!"

I especially appreciated his talk at the market where he showed the \"boring\" (Western) versions of Thai ingredients - though boring, it was good to know what ingredients I could substitute at home. Non also had a great sense of humor - loved him taking \"selfies\" with his students. Non also made sure to ask each of us with cameras if we wanted photos taken while we cooked - very thoughtful.Each day the school teaches a different menu - I took a Sunday class with Tom Yum soup, massaman curry, green papaya salad, pad thai, and mango with sticky rice. Though you do some prep work as a group (making coconut milk, chopping some veggies), much of the measuring and other prep is done for you. As an avid cook, this was a bit disappointing but I still felt I learned a lot about the cuisine and how to prepare it. The glossy cookbook provided at the end is an excellent reference too. The food was FANTASTIC and I left feeling very full. If you take morning class I would recommend having some breakfast before hand - you don't really start eating until 10:30.The cooking school sends excellent directions to get to the meeting point. The school is set up in a tall building - you hoof it up some stairs to get to the classroom, so if mobility is an issue, this isn't a good option. Also you do the cooking in woks set up outdoors on the patio - on a hot day this is a bit uncomfortable, but the prep work and eating is done in air conditioned rooms."

Once back at the school we were shown how to make 5 different dishes. The school does all the prep work while you are eating each dish so it's very easy to follow along with what goes in what but still a lot of fun to cook each thing yourself. At the end we received a cooking booklet that shows a ton of Thai recipes.

He told me that the Silom Cooking School was the best one he attended, so my wife and I decided to sign up. They didn't disappoint as we had a great time with our instructor Nom.The first little bit is spent at the market. Instructions are provided for the meeting point which is at one of the BTS Skytrain stations so it's very easy to get to. At the market, Nom was very good at explaining all the ingredients we were getting. Some of the ingredients are variations of what we have back home such as ginger and eggplants. After we loaded up with food, it was a short walk back to the school. At the school we were able to do some preparation such as making our own coconut milk and chopping some of the ingredients. However, the school does a lot of the legwork for you. Although they do a lot of the prep, it was still great to learn the basics of Thai cooking and the reasoning behind some of the steps. The woks we used are extremely hot so the food cooked super fast. We made tom yum soup, pad thai and red curry. They also prepared us some deep fried fish cakes and mango with sweet sticky rice. Nom is a funny guy and made the class quite enjoyable. We had a small class of 7 including us from Canada, another couple from Germany, two guys from Malaysia and Japan, and a girl from France. We definitely enjoyed this experience so if you're looking for something to do in Bangkok or if you get tired of all the temples (which you probably will...) consider this class. My wife said it's one of the highlights of our trip. We also really liked the utensils we were using to mix the food in the wok. They were made of coconut shell, didn't burn and were very light. The school sells them for 50 bhat each so we picked some up to bring back home. As mentioned in other reviews, we also got a cookbook which we've been using at home. Thanks to Nom for a great morning!Tip: If you're in the morning class, have a light breakfast beforehand. We didn't get a chance to eat and the first meal is at about 10 or 10:30."

And we are so glad we did! Mhai's communication via email was very quick and personal, and it was very easy to organise this way. The instructions on where to meet are extremely thorough (its not that hard to find!) and its very well organised, especially as its a simple, small establishment.The market tour is not to be missed, a real highlight for us, just to see where they get all their ingredients and although we are foodies we still picked up some helpful tips. Our group leader 'Oat' was friendly and entertaining and helped to make it a very enjoyable, light hearted experience.The cooking component was also great - making everything from scratch in traditional ways. What I liked especially about this school was that you each make your own individual dishes - so if you don't like seafood, or coriander, or whatever - you simply leave out of your dish (or substitute). Simple! So perfect for fussy eaters, vegetarians, those with allergies etc. You make a dish then eat it, and make the next etc. So definitely don't eat much before you come, you'll be eating a lot of delicious food!We each got a recipe book at the end with all the recipes we made plus more, and helpful tips of the ingredients and how to find them etc.For 1000 baht p/p this is exceptional value for money and a genuine, not-to-be-missed experience to have in Thailand. I would recommend to anyone!"

The price was right too (like $30 US!). Upon booking, I received a very detailed description and pictures of where to meet the chef in the morning. We took a taxi to the location (we took the train home as there was a station semi-close by, and I like taking public transit... also it can be hard to get a metered taxi off the street in comparison to a hotel). While at the market our instructor reviewed various types of peppers, mushrooms, ginger, eggplant and more while comparing it to the \"boring\" generic types that are found at most supermarkets around the world. We were also provided a cold bottle of water at the market. The school itself was a short walk away. The cooking itself was done out on a balcony area as we rotated between two air conditioned rooms in the building to prep the food and eat the food. The instructor was very helpful and knowledgeable about the food, and she had a sense of humor as well!. I can't remember her name though! We took the morning class on Sunday February 23 with the female instructor. We made Tom Yum soup, Pad Thai, Massaman Curry, Sum Tom and made the coconut milk for Mango with Sticky Rice. Everything was DELICIOUS. We left with full stomachs. A cookbook with all the recipes we made as well as other recipes were given to us complimentary. And you could also buy an apron for 500 Baht. So much fun! Next time I'm in Bangkok I want to try the other courses here!"

They meet with you, give you a basket with some water and off to the market a few blocks away. Then back to the school using back streets, its amazing how Thai people live. The school is air conditioned (thank you) and very clean. They teach you about ingredients and you chop up the vegetables and devein shrimps. Ask for a stool if you are like me and can't sit on floor. Then we cook each dish on our own woks and tiny stove. Thai food is spicy sweet and sour. It really was a good experience that I will be doing again at night without the market tour since it was soooo hot. Non our chef was happy and very knowledgeable and just kept smiling. Thanks Non!"

Our guide/chef was awesome (unfortunately, I forgot his name, but I know that he runs a Thai Restaurant in the UK) as he was extremely knowledgable, energetic, and just made the whole experience fun from teaching us about the ingredients in the local marketplace, cleaning/preparing the food, and of course cooking! He was extremely engaged to his students and encouraged everybody to participate. It also helped that our group was great. We cooked several dishes and gave us a sense of accomplishment. It never tastes as good when I'm cooking by myself! Our chef also provided us with a delicious mango sticky rice (made by him) at the end. Extremely well organised in every detail. From my understanding, quite affordable compared to other cooking classes. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

After reading the many reviews on activities to do in Bangkok, Thailand, participating in a half day cooking school seemed to be close to the top of the list. After doing research and reading reviews on which cooking school to participate in, we decided on going with the Silom Thai Cooking School. The tour started in the market where we were introduced to all the various types of ingredients that are used in Thai cooking. Not only did my husband and I thoroughly enjoy learning and being introduced to some many new types of food, we loved being a part of the everyday local Thai life style. Following the tour of the market and obtaining all our ingredients we were taken to the school and given a moment to take a quick break before getting on with the food preparation. We really enjoyed the small group environment that this school allowed for \u2013 which we found very intimate and relaxing. All members of the group were given specific duties in order to help prepare the 5 course meal that we were going to be taking in. The way the program was set up was that we, the group, would make one dish at a time, enjoy it and then move on to the next. My husband and I did the Friday course which we really enjoyed and highly recommend. Thank you for a wonderful experience!"

The meeting place was walking distance from the sky train and step by step details on how to get there are emailed to you once you make a booking. Once we met out teacher Jay ( who by the way is amazing!), we headed to the wet seafood market and vegetable market. Jay showed us the difference between produce and what dishes could be made with them,we were allowed to touch and smell. We were each given a little basket which i thought was very cute. We then walked the backstreets through ally ways and backyards and got a feel of how thai people live. once we reached, we removed our shoes and entered an airconditioned prep room where we were showed how to cut and clean our ingedients, we had a portion for ourselves. We then prepared delicious pad thai,tom yum kung,sweet rice and mango, green curry and rice paper rolls.It had a very homely and inviting feel to it. Everything was so well organized with lots of info given to us throughout the class. We were also given booklet at the end with all the recipes to take home.We looked up other cooking schools and Silom Thai was by far the best value for money AND had the best menu. I would definitely go back everytime :)"

I had booked the morning class and met the guide from the school who directed us to our teachers. The teacher leading my group was Goon, and she is absolutely amazing! She took us on a tour of the local market and introduced us to the ingredients we would be working with. She was happy to answer any questions we had and made everyone in the group feel comfortable. Once back at the school we were shown to the lockers where we could keep our belongings while we did the cooking. There were two separate rooms, one for enjoying the food we cooked and one for the cooking lesson. The actual cooking was done in the open along the corridor where each student had a separate cooking station. We cooked five dishes during the entire session that included tom yam goon, pad thai, fish cakes with sweet chilli sauce, Thai red curry and mango sticky rice. Goon was very patient when explaining how to cook each dish with detailed explanation of the ingredients and cooking technique (which is very basic). After each dish was cooked we got to eat it and were sufficiently full by the last couple of dishes! At the end of the class, you are given a recipe cook which recaps the dishes taught on the day as well as other popular Thai dishes. The class costs 1000 baht which is payable at the end of the course. Also do note that the dishes taught each day are slightly different and can be viewed on the school website."

Our guide was there promptly and took the group to the market with our wicker baskets to buy the ingredients for the menus. The school is like a house tucked down a side street of Silom. You prepare the ingredients as a group then have your own cooking station to cook the dishes. We made 5 dishes - pad Thai, green curry, red curry, Tom yum soup and mango sticky rice. After making each dish you sit and eat your food - I would recommend having a small breakfast! At the end of the morning you receive a cookery cook so you can recreate the dishes at home. It was such a fun experience! The course costs 1000 baht per person - approximately \u00a320 - it is such good value. We went to another cookery school last year which was very impressive and slick but on reflection the Silom cookery school was much more fun! Well worth a try!"

I had originally wanted to try another local cooking school that overall had better reviews, but they were closed for the Christmas holidays. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise as we ended up at Silom! Our instructor was Noni and he was the best. Very knowledgeable, patient, funny and friendly. The market tour at the beginning of class was great. We learned how to pick out fresh shrimp and what the different Thai ingredients look like. We were put into a group of about 10 people total and we all worked together to create the meal, chopping veggies, making rice, mashing tamarinds, etc. All of the cooking is done outside on gas ranges and the food you make is amazing. You will be stuffed at the end of the class, so don't eat too much at breakfast and don't plan on eating much for dinner later. The instruction and all the interaction we had with the Silom staff was first-rate. A really dedicated and kind bunch of people. One thing I thought was kind of weird was that the school emailed me a set of instructions in Thai to print out for our cab driver, along with very specific directions to the meeting place. This turned out to be the BEST THING EVER. After being in Bangkok for about 5 minutes, you will realize the incredible value of this. Thank you, Silom, for the amazing experience. We've already made Pad Thai at home and while it wasn't as great as what we made with real fresh Thai ingredients under Noni's direction, it was still delicious!"

We covered all our basis from veggies to protein and it was a great start to the program. The menu as well covered all the key touch points from making green curry from scratch to the usual pad thai (best version we ate though), spring rolls with a homemade chile sauce, Tom yom soup and sticky rice with mango. Given the price we paid, experience we had, it was one of the best meals and value we had in bangkok. It was the perfect amount of prep, really delving into the different types of ginger, herbs and how to prepare them for each dish. Everyone cooked their own dish in their own wok station with high heat burners. It was great for beginners and experienced cooks and was taught with such a great pace and demeanor. Highly recommend."

Our instructor K\u00fbng (her name is Thai for shrimp!) took us to the market and we learned about different key Thai ingredients. This was helpful for later, when we actually used the ingredients, as we had already been introduced. It was really interesting to see the variety of ingredients, some familiar, and some new (boring ginger vs. finger ginger!) Our party of 6 (Mother in law, my wife and I and our three kids- 9, 7, 2) had a great time both making and eating each dish. The older kids were especially proud of their creations. K\u00fbng was so genuinely kind to them, it was like we spent the morning with an old friend. They have things down to a science as far as logistics and flow of the program. If we find ourselves in Bangkok again, we'll definitely be back, I can't recommend them enough!"

The Chef instructors speak great English and everything is broken down step by step so you understand. I'm taking as much 5 classes and it's well worth the cost. Would recommend this school to anyone wanting to learn to cook Thai food."

Our guide was Goong, who was exceptionally enthusiastic and made sure that everyone was involved in the class throughout. We learned all about the different herbs and ingredients of Thai cooking in the market, and were then shown how to prepare them in the cook school nearby; from washing to chopping, we all gained new cooking skills. We each had our own individual gas cooker, so everyone had the opportunity to make each dish, rather than it just being a demonstration, which was brilliant. Also, one guest on our trip was allergic to shellfish and this was accommodated very well, plus we all got to try an extra vegetarian dish :) We got a cook book with all of the recipes from our course (and more) included, which was a nice touch. This was a morning well spent in Bangkok, and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience - all staff were friendly and very helpful, and I would definitely recommend this to others!"

This arrangement worked really well. The market trip is interesting and fun, the classes are the same.You get to sit on the floor for chopping and preparing, then all get their own cooker. It feels like traditional home cooking, with the freshest ingredients imaginable. It's brilliantly organised so you get to make 5 or 6 dishes in just a few hours. Brilliant."

Some reviews described it as rough and ready, which we thought was fair considering the price. But it turned out to be an incredibly professional, educational and fun addition to our holiday. Our instructor Oat was fantastic (and hilarious), taking us through the various ingredients at the market beforehand and then showing us how to make five of the most delicious dishes we had all holiday - and we ate out a lot! The pad thai and tom yum soup were especially tasty. I'd recommend doing the early class, because the market is full of fresh ingredients in the morning and you won't be tempted to eat before you go - you'll want to save your appetite for the food you make. As well as cooking and eating, the instructors are brilliant at giving you information and advice about Bangkok, and it's useful to talk to your fellow cooking students about their experiences too.We plan to go back to Bangkok and some of the islands at some point in the future, and we will without a doubt book a class at Silom again.

I took my son (age 13) and daughter (age 10) with me to the cooking class at Silom Thai Cooking school. Was not quite sure if kids would be welcome, but much to my surprise they were welcomed with open arms. I especially appreciated how Oat our chef master treated them so kindly and put them to work.We learned how to make 5 dishes. All were delicious and of our own creation, so there were no empty plates. That alone is a victory for me as a mom, getting my two kids to cook something new AND eat everything off their plates ( every meal must come from here! LOL) so proud of them! The kids came home and gushed for hours to their father about how much fun they had. (Now that is a another win! Tweens rarely do that.) The trip to the market was also fun and we learned a lot about the key ingredients. THey also left us with a recipe booklet, so we could make it all at home. It was also quite nice to get to know the other travelers in our group who all brought their own spice to the experience. We were the only family there that day, but I am sure not the only ones who ever brought children. Mostly adult traveler groups. Sign up was easy, so was check out. I can't recommend more highly. We'll be signing up for another class before we leave Thailand."

We made coconut milk and Thai red paste from scratch and used them in the cooking. The food was amazing and definitely recipes I'm going to cook. The Thai fish cakes were my favourite out of the 5 recipes we cooked and ate ! I was so full when we left :.)

I just loved the market - the produce was incredible and everything so much cleaner than many asian markets. We had Jai (hope the spelling is correct) as our Teacher and he was such a lot of fun and made us all relax. My husband really enjoyed the class and has promised to try out the recipes once we are home.This well priced class is highly organised and well worth the time spent. The morning went so quickly and we were so full, that we could hardly eat much dinner that night. If we return to Bali we will also return and do another class on a different day to try the other recipes, but it was a pleasant surprise to find that in the book that we were given on completion of the class were all the other recipes from the other days as well.

I'd booked the cookery class a month or so in advance having read the reviews and arrived in Bangkok literally an hour or so before I had to be at the meeting point. Nothing like cutting it fine.So taxi directions provided (thank you Silom, you don't know how useful this is as subsequent cab rides about the city proved difficult but that's another story) I arrived at the meeting point and there were 5 or 6 people already there. Then there were another 5, then another 6. I became a little concerned having just done a cookery school in Saigon with only 5 people, this was becoming a crowd rather than a class.Then (thankfully) we were split into groups of 8 and introduced to our teacher. And off we went to the market to collect our veg. I have to be honest, I've seen enough fruit and veg stalls in SE Asia already so wasn't that bothered. Mistake number 1. A very interesting lesson it was too. Don't miss it as if you're familiar with produce back home, you can see and hear about the differences between what they have in Thailand. Then back to the superbly organised 'school'. Busy, well equipped we set about making Pad Thai, Yom Tom, Green Curry in quick succession. Each dish prepared by us, the students, from the collective chopping and cleaning of veg, to the pounding of our green curry paste. I wish I had remembered the teacher's name but she was friendly, interestingly and an excellent teacher.Anyway, it's a perfect afternoon to spend in BK and to my surprise, I have to say I had the best Pad Thai I've ever eaten, and the even bigger surprise was that I actually cooked it."

Chef Oat was knowledgable, humorous and friendly. We helped chop vegetables to prep and then learned about each dish one at a time --learning, prepping, cooking, eating. The food was delicious and each student had his own wok station. The facility was very nice, extremely clean and a good teaching environment. The staff was great. My main recommendation would be to let students do more of the prep work, as it felt like we were waiting a while to get started in the beginning.

The instructor (\"Oat\") was incredibly informative, approachable and created a wonderful experience for us all. The place is incredibly clean and there is a very strong focus on personal hygiene (i.e. we washed our hands pretty much constantly throughout the evening). You get a recipe book at the end with even more recipes than covered during the class. This was truly a holiday highlight...The only recommendation I would make is give yourself a few extra minutes to get there. It's very hidden and out of the way, and it is actually a bit further than the website directions map implies."

The chef Jay was a bubbly chap and went through quite a number of Thai ingredients (for us the novice cook) in the market. We weren't sure if we could find the same type of things back home and so he did recommend some replacement, which would probably be useful (whether it tastes as good or not remains to be seen). We made four dishes, including a dessert. Not totally from scratch as some of the things were already pre-cut. This is okay by us as we were not there to learn to cut things perfectly anyway. The food we prepared was delicious and frankly better than all the other similar Thai food we had during the whole trip ! So even though I didn't plan to actually cook when I got back, I now itch to cook the dishes we learned !"

Well, we were very pleasantly surprised by the Silom Thai Cooking School, we had so much fun. The experience starts with a brief but very informative market tour before heading off to the school with baskets of ingredients. We were told we'd be shown 5 different dishes in the space of the morning, seemed like an impossibility but it wasn't. the preparation is done in the traditional Thai way with each of sitting on the floor with the chef sitting front and centre. Each one of us assisted with preparation along the way. When preparation was complete for each dish we then moved to the balcony to each of our cooking stations to finish the dish. Help was always at had with a very attentive Chef Oat keeping his eyes on proceedings. As soon as our dishes were cooked we then moved to the dining room to devour our tasty creations.At the end of the class you are presented with a really nice little cookbook with each of the ingredients and dishes detailed within. There are also bonus recipes in the book. We were also given a very simple but very effective wok spatula made from a coconut shell to take home.Honestly for 1000 Baht you would be hard pressed to find a better value activity in Bangkok. Can't recommend this place and the experience highly enough. Oh, and I would suggest not eating before you go to class as the 5 course meal is quite filling!"

We chose Silom because it offered classic dishes prepared in a classic way (i.e., on the floor and in a house with outdoor kitchens) and included a market tour. You meet your chef at a street corner near the market and are escorted through the market with explanations on what everything was and how to buy it. One of the things I learned was how to tell if a shrimp is fresh! It was also helpful to learn about all of the vegetables/roots/herbs I am not familiar with (Tamarind for example). Our chef was Oat and he was gracious and patient and very good at teaching the art of Thai cooking. This is the first hands-on cooking class I have taken that I actually got to do everything \u2013 most classes you share the experience with 1 or more other people. We each made our own portions of each dish \u2013 no small task in that we made 5 dishes plus our own green curry paste. We even made our own coconut milk which was a great experience. Each day has a set menu of items you will cook \u2013 so if you want to come to this school, pick the day that offers the menu items you\u2019d like to learn to make. All of the prep work is done is a large room on the floor with a mat and all of the ingredients arranged in beautiful baskets and dishes \u2013 each person has their own chopping block and knife and chops everything needed for all of the menu items. We were even taught to wash and arrange things in a pleasing way before we cooked. Each person has their own cooking station as well so you really get the experience of actually cooking it yourself. Being a Monday, we made Spicy Shrimp Soup, Pad Thai, Chicken Salad, Green curry with chicken and desert rubies in coconut milk (this was amazing \u2013 who would have thought turnips could be so good?) The class also included basic instruction on what was important in Thai cooking and what was not \u2013 so that recipes are not set in stone \u2013 just certain parts. Good to know! The best part was eating it all! All that for $35 US and excellent camaraderie with other students from all over the world and you leave with a cookbook so you can\u2019t possibly forget how to do it! It was the best experience we had in Bangkok! We should have signed up for more days! So if you find yourself with 5 hours with nothing to do in Bangkok \u2013 this would be a fun, enriching, delicious way to spend that time."

Same reaction given by Mai, his point guard, whereupon my wife decided we didn't want to continue given their arrogant & flippant attitude.

We were two groups with 6 people each, so not big groups really.Walking back to the school, you prepare I think five or six dishes in 3h. And you get to eat them all :) Tbh, some steps were prepared by an armada of well organised and almost invisible helpers, others we did ourselves hands on. You get inside knowledge about traditional Thai cooking utensils and what are basic musts in the dishes and which ingredients you can replace which what ever is available at your market back home.Our instructor Koy had a great humor and we had some great laughs!The two groups ate together in the same room but were instructed separately. Meal preparation took place traditionally on the floor but a chair was offered if you wanted one. Everyone got their wok assigned outside for the actual cooking sessions. Hand hygiene is held high and before every session of food preparation you are asked to wash your hands. At the end of it all, you get a little booklet with all recipes (and more) you have done during the day and less of a question mark in your eyes when looking at menus in Thai restaurants in the future!On your way out you leave the fee of 1000THB in a basket.We have done this course as a couple and enjoyed it very much!For someone that already has basic knowledge of Thai cooking, this mightn't be the class to be taking but I think they offer advanced courses as well.We would recommend Silom Thai Cooking School!"

Head over to the market where your chef explains your ingredients, head back to the cooking school (modest but comfortable accommodations) and get a detailed class on what you're cooking and how to cook it. Eat all day and walk out of there full, educated, and carrying a cookbook. I really can't explain how great this was."

My partner and I are foodies, and were disappointed that a lot of the prep work was done for you and there was a bunch of sitting around between dishes. If you're looking for a class with some hands-on components, but fairly easy as a participant, this would be a good fit. If you want to go through all the steps of each dish, this is probably not the right class for you. Overall, it felt pretty touristy for a cooking class even though the chef was very knowledgeable and all the food from the day was delicious. We also appreciated getting a printed recipe book, which we've already cooked from at home."

The small group of eight that we were part of included dedicated cooks determined to grasp the finer arts of Thai cooking down to ourselves - who thought it might just be fun to learn a little and enjoy the process. When the half day was over it seemed all were well satisfied.The whole process was highly organised. The detailed instructions to reach them were faultless. And there was a backroom team setting lots of stuff up while our informative cook walked us through the big issues at a pace that we could easily follow and in excellent English. It was all charming and personable \u2013 our names were remembered, questions were asked and encouragement was given. Better still, we got to eat what we had cooked ourselves and it was really delicious. So something had gone right.It also seemed incredibly good value with dedicated tuition, lots of support, all the ingredients and a nice booklet of the recipes we had worked through. Surprise \u2013 there was not even a big sell and a \u2018please exit through the gift shop\u2019. We left with a nice experience in our hearts, a warm tang on our lips, and our wallets not having been raped. A lovely way to spend half a day in Bangkok."

We met our amazing chef who was full of energy and spoke English very well. She took us for a tour of the local market so we could pick up the ingredients we would need for our class. That experience alone sets it apart from other classes. Having the knowledge of the ingredients is something I'll remember for ever. The school is clean and appealing. It's beautifully set up and user friendly. They keep it interesting and fun. The best part is how well organized it is. There were 8 people in my group and there was never any waiting around or clean up. We would go out and cook and we would come back to the classroom and it was set up to go for the next task. This is a must do! Worth the 1000 Baht. Best experience so far in Bangkok!"

We paid 1200bhat for the course as we booked through an agent and thought it was worth it. We started by going to the nearby markets for an informative tour on thai vegetables and collected some of the ingredients needed for the day. We didn't know what we were going to make untill we arrived which was one of the bonuses as we thought there would be too many good things to choose from if we had to. Once we arrived at the school, a very clean organised place that smelt amazing, we were sat in the dining area for about 5 min while they set up our rooms. We were each given interesting books about Thailand to look thru while we waited. There was 6 people in our group and 6 in another group in the next room. We made a total of 5 dishes, starting straight away with pad thai (the best one we had in Thailand) which we then were able to enjoy straight away for lunch. We then made vege spring rolls with sweet chilli sauce and papaya salad and ate them in the class. We finished by making banana fritters and massaman curry and got to enjoy them for dinner and even got icecream with the banana fritters for dessert. All the food was exceptional and was adjusted to our individual taste I.e spicy or not spicy. The course was not make your own but we all had a pretty good hands on experience and learnt all the necessary skills needed to make it at home. Our guide goong was a lovely lady, very friendly helpful and funny. Being a chef myself I found this a great experience and would do it again to learn something different. We all received a recipee book with about 30 dishes in it and could take free postcards at the end."

I saw this course recommended in the lonely planet and the night before I emailed and they replied almost immediately. The course was great it begin with the visit to the market which was great as we got to learn how to pick the best ingredients and also what to use when you get back home if you can't find these items! We cooked 6 lovely dishes and we have tried one since we got home. The chef teachers are great, very informative and very open to questions, its good fun and the groups are not too big. We would highly recommend this course we had seen others without a market trip that cost more. However you do need to grt to the meeting point yourself but they will fax the directions in thai to your hotel so you only have to show this to the taxi driver and it shouldnt cost any more than about 70b to get there which isnt bad for a good experience. its great fun and you get to meet great people all whilst learning about delicious Thai cooking! Also we did the morning course and found it hard to eat the food at the early time so if your like us and more used to eating afternoon I'd go for the afternoon course so you can fully enjoy all your creations. In saying that we brought two dishes home so ask for a container if you can't eat it. Enjoy!!"

And the best is how to squeeze the lime juice with the knife and letting it drip into a small container using simple steps.We get to taste and eat the food that we cooked immediately. The ingredients were fresh, I could not imagine myself eating the Tom Yum Goong I cooked myself. Apart from cooking, I also get to know friends from around the world who share the same passion like me for cooking. I really recommend to join this class and they have different menu each day.

We researched a couple of options before our trip to Bangkok and decided to go with a Silom Thai because of their menu, convenient location and price. I corresponded with them by e-mail to make arrangements for a Monday morning class. On the morning of the class we waited in our spot at the Nonsi BTS but no one came to pick us up so we went back to our hotel to check e-mail. Monday was a holiday and I thought maybe we had missed last minute instructions. I didn't have any messages from the school and I sent an e-mail letting them know that we had missed them. Within minutes we had a e-mail apologizing for the miscommunication and we were offered a free class that afternoon or another day of our choice. They called the hotel and faxed information before we had a chance to respond to the e-mail. We took the afternoon class and had a great experience. Mai made sure that everything was OK and overall the school is very well organized. Oliver was a good teacher and answered all of our questions, most of the actual cooking was hands-on. The class was very basic which met our needs because we were not familiar with Thai dishes before our trip. Because we each made our own dishes, we were able to add as much chili as we wanted. The recipe book reinforced what we learned and helped us find seasonings to take back home with us."

So each dish I ate was one that I prepared from beginning to end. (Well, almost: typically, the raw materials were measured and laid out in advance.) The personnel were great: our chef, Oliver, was charming, informative, speaks excellent English, and has a great sense of humor. The manager, Mai, was helpful and pleasant. It is also an excellent value, one of the less expensive of the very many cooking schools in Bangkok.

Most of the cooking schools in Bangkok are quite expensive, and while this was certainly more than we had paid in both Vietnam and Cambodia for similar cooking experiences, this one was much more professional and reasonable. The market visit wasn't that interesting, especially if you already know what all the fruits and vegetables are, but it's probably worth it for many people. Back at the school, you get some really nice personal attention because it's not a restaurant with a cooking class in the corner - it's JUST a cooking school, which is great. There are two things about Silom Thai Cooking School that I commend them on. One is that the food proportions are very reasonable. You cook each dish one at a time and then eat them, which spaces things out a little, and you also don't get mountains of food to eat. You won't leave hungry, but you won't feel like death either. The other thing that was nice was the cookbook we received before we left. It's a full colour booklet containing all the recipes they offer, including lists of ingredients and pictures of everything you should use. We were able to take the book over to Top's Supermarket around the corner and purchase a lot of the spices and pastes so we can cook Thai food when we return home!Thanks James (our chef and teacher) for a fun afternoon!"

Even though I didn't pay for my 9 year old daughter, Oliver let her do a few bits. He and David are great. Everything is well run. Oliver is really funny too. The food that we made was absolutely delicious. I can't wait to try it at home. You even get a recipe book at the end to take away.Loved it. Woudl definitely recommend."

Upon the first communication with them, we were instantly impressed, and they never let us down. Silom runs an incredibly professional operation. Extremely clear and concise directions and instructions were emailed to us on where to meet. The trip to the market is well planned and executed, giving a great intro to the ingredients used. The actual brick and mortar cooking school is well laid out, extremely clean, and pleasant to be in. They have the class organized very well and everything is done at a perfect pace. These women seem to have taken classes on how to teach people because the instruction method is excellent. Of course, the food selections are great and tastes absolutely delicious! My wife and I felt that what really made the course a success is the people running it and their commitment to a good product. Thank you, Mai and Goong for a fun afternoon!"

The trip to the market was interesting and we learned a great deal about the ingredients. Our female chef had a wonderful personality, very good English, and effectively engaged everyone in the diverse group (the other couples were Japanese, Korean, and French). The afternoon class was a good way to escape the heat of the day and have an early dinner. The food we made was some of the best of our entire trip.If we had had more time in BKK, we might have gone back on a second day to make other dishes ... it was that good."

I enjoyed the class so much that I proceeded to attend classes for 3 days straight.I particularly appreciated the extra effort made on my behalf on the last day, where the dishes scheduled were a repeat of my first class, so instead of cooking the same dishes, they arranged a special menu for me.Also because I attended classes 3 days, I received a cerificate - a nice touchThanks to all at the school."

We attended another class at the Silom Thai Cooking School since our first visit four years ago.Now, Nusi no longer runs classes on his own but he has a team of chefs and assistants who speaks good English (very important if you are going to learn anything at all) and are friendly, professional and great at what they do.Mai confirmed our booking via a couple of emails. She met us at the train station in the morning and took us to the local wet market where we met Goong, our chef/teacher for the morning class. After the introduction to the local produce in the market, we went back to the cooking school which is housed in a three storey apartment/building. Goong took us through the cooking of five different types of Thai food. She explains each step clearly, guide us as we each cook our own food and offering advice on ingredient substitutes so that we can actually cook the same food back home.What makes the cooking class interesting is that everyone is given his/her own wok, chopping board, etc., so you get hands-on experience instead of just watching the chef cooks. After cooking each course, we sat down to enjoy the food we cook ourselves. Even people can't cook like myself enjoys the experience very much.Overall, the experience is still just as splendid, the team is still as friendly and the food is still as great as we had experienced four years ago. We will definitely visit again the next time we are in Bangkok."

I would joke that it is so inexpensive that they cannot afford tables to cook on, but it is, as we were told, a traditional way of Thai cooking.So, now all jokes aside, this was one of the best experiences that I have had in Thailand in 15 years of visits to Thailand! The Silom Thai Cooking school facility was very clean, and well maintained. When you arrive at the school, you are provided with a locker for your personal belongings, although I kept my camera with me, and am glad I did.The days menu was very well thought out, providing a variety of Thai staple foods to learn from.Keep in mind, in a 4 hour class, you will probably NOT be able to learn everything about Thai cooking. And I know that will be a surprise to some people out there. So all of the ingredients are pre-measured for your convenience. This makes it kind of a 'paint by numbers' class, but that is not a bad thing. We were able to spend more time on the process of making the base ingredients. I never imagined I would learn how to make coconut milk or cream, but today I learned this very simple practice, and am sure I will use it at home to improve my cooking.I also did not know how relatively easy it is to make a masaman curry paste. Everything was presented clearly and concisely. The staff spoke clearly in Englsh, which is truly appreciated by the lingually challenged like myself. But our class, which was broken into two groups, was made up of an Aussie, an American, a couple of Kiwi's, several Germans, and a nice young couple from Korea. It seems that everyone was able to understand the class, and more importantly, I think that at the end of the class, we all had a great boost to our Thai cooking confidence, and had a great time doing so.And dont worry about taking notes... the school provides you with a recipe book at the end of the class, so that you can try these things (and more) at home.In all, it was a great experience in which I learned a lot, made some nice friends, and had a fantastic meal that I can proudly say that I made!And who knows... if time permits on the back end of my trip, I may attend another class at the Silom Thai Cooking School! I would genuinely tell you that this was 4 hours and THB1000 well spent, and I look forward to experiencing it again soon.Finally, if the two women from Germany or the couple from Korea read this, I hope they will contact me (no offense to the men in my group :) )"

Silom Thai Cooking School to the rescue!!First,the bad luck: My husband and I, along with our friend who was travelling with us, arrived in Bangkok all excited about a full day tour that we were on early the very next day. Unfortunately, as luck would have it, the tour was cancelled at the last minute (20 minutes after the scheduled pick-up time) due to complications. There we were, the three of us standing in the hotel lobby at 7:30 a.m. on a Sunday morning with nothing to do :(Now, the good luck: My husband jumped into action immediately by checking with the hotel's concierge desk to see if there were any other tours we could get on at the last minute. With some quick phone calls and quick decisions we opted for the last three spots to join that morning's cooking lesson at the Silom Thai Cooking School. Best decision ever!!The whole experience was fantastic! We rushed (as time was not on our side) to the meeting point, to be warmly welcomed by our very friendly guide Goong and the other participants for that mornings class. Our first mission was to tour the market and learn about all the fresh ingredients we were going to cook with. That part was definitely an experience of itself. We got to touch, taste and smell some of ingredients to know how to pick out the best, and that is exactly what we did. Only the best would do! All of us received a basket (which included a bottle of water) to put the fresh produce into, in order to help carry it back to the school, which was within walking distance of both the market and pick up point. Very convenient!Upon arriving to the very clean and attractive decor of the school, we were more then excited to get started. With shoes off, aprons on and hands properly washed, we were tasked with washing and artistically presenting our fresh vegetables. The rest was simple prep and lots of fun. We each received a chopping board and knife and a tray to place our prepared ingredients on. Chef Jay entertainingly demonstrated the cutting of the ingredients that were new to us and those that had to be prepared with a special technique. After the demo, we had to do our own, which also resulted in each persons dish being unique and to their own personal liking. With the rest of the ingredients already pre-measured for us, it was off to our individual woks to start cooking. It was a memorable moment to see all of us in a long row at our own cooking station and Chef Jay and Goong in front of us, assisting each of us as neccessary to accomplish a successful dish.After preparing each dish (tom kah gai, chicken & cashew nut and red curry chicken), which we did on our own and the rest (glass noodle salad, fish cakes and bananas in coconut milk), which was done by Chef Jay and as a group, we were taken into the dining room where we proudly ate our own creations. Not wanting to be competitive in any way of course, each of us claimed to have made the best dish :)At the end of the tour, they even reimbursed us for our taxi fare to the school.All three of us want to highly recommend taking a day off the usual highlights of Bangkok tour and join this fabulous cooking school for an experience you will never forget! Thank you Chef Jay, Goong and all the other wonderful people at the SilomThai cooking school for rescuing our day. It was the best!!!"

He possessed a very charming character, very hospitable and of course really funny.For vegetarians, you should not face any problem as this place is vegetarians friendly. Please inform them on your reservation email or while doing market tour. For Muslims, they dont use any pork or lard. Perhaps they bought meats and chickens from Thai Muslim seller. Nusi (owner) himself is a Muslim, who can speaks Malay as well.All my foods taste good. Usually I cant eat my self-prepared meals. But this time, I dont leave anything on my plate. If you have to pay for hotel breakfast, skip that! This morning session can cover your breakfast and lunch. You wont get hungry coz when you done your 1st meal, then you start eating before going to the next meal.I will come back here. Very enjoyable, very entertaining and very knowledgable.

If you are looking for facilities with a professional kitchen, this is not the place. I liked the coziness of he place and it's simple equipment that you can find in your own kitchen. No fancy gadgets, just a wok, stove, mortar and pestle and your hands. It starts off with a tour of the local market where our teacher, Jay, introduced us to the common ingredients that you can find in Thai cuisine.Then we headed to the School. Preparation work is done while seated on the floor, so, ladies, please wear confortable pants or shorts. It's usually, prep the ingredients, proceed to the stove to cook, then feast on your creation and repeat..We did five dishes in total (the menu changes daily, so check their website for what you will be learning for the day) - Tom yum soup, green curry, chicken salad, pad Thai and water chestnut dessert.Each class is nine people max. Our teacher was great and funny. And depending on your luck, you may have very funny classmates that add to the fun. I don't cook at home. For a novice cook, I found the instructions easy to understand. The cooking was easy too with the exception of the heat from the stove. Thai food needs to be cooked in high heat as well.The class comes with a free recipe book that covers the common Thai dishes and items."

You cook on the balcony, and there's two rooms: a dining room and a prep room. Goong was just so lovely. Really patient and just happy to share her knowlege. Explained every principle and technique thoroughly, and the details of ingredients that was easy to understand.We made fresh coconut milk, and then prepped Tom Yum Goong (made with the fresh coconut milk). For me this was the highlight of the night (and dessert!). Just so simple, but incredibly delicious.Then onto Chicken and Cashew stirfry. After that we made Penang Curry, and of course the Thai Green Curry. All done with patience and attention to detail. After that we had the sticky rice and mango. Just a wonderful experience, and was a highlight of my trip.I've already used my take home cook book (which has LOADS of info in it!)So if you're wandering around Bangkok, love proper Thai food and have a few hours to kill, this is DEFINITELY worth it!

The staff members at Silom Thai Cooking School were very organized and sent a confirmation by fax to our hotel with details on how to get to the meeting place. First the market trip, which only had a few remaining stalls open (they open very early) but our instructor Jay made identifying the vegetables and herbs informative, fun and interesting. The actual school is located inside one of the small streets and occupied a whole floor of the building. It was a bit of a walk from the market to the school and my 72 year old mother struggled especially in the heat but Jay was understanding and slowed the walking pace. We sat on the floor when preparing the ingredients and my mother coped with this. I was worried when my 12 year old son was asked to cut the vegetables but he was properly supervised so he also coped. There was never a dull moment and we all loved the experience of preparing the ingredients, cooking two dishes then eating them together as a group. There were also lots of photo opportunities while cooking and eating. The owner refunded us the taxi fare to get to the school and gave a discounted rate for the 12 year old. It was value for money and truly a memorable experience for my family."

I am so glad I took the glasses.Mai was the coordinator who we worked with to schedule the class and she did a phenomenal job in the entire process. I had this super huge shopping bag with me that Mai took it with her to the school since we had to go to the market to pick/learn about thai vegetables. That was so very sweet of her!Jay was our chef and his sense of humor was simply amazing that made it a lot easier for the team to cook. His style of teaching was fantastic!I made the Tom Yum soup, Pad Thai, Larb Gai and the Green curry chicken. They also taught us how to make the green curry paste.The owner was just a nice gentlemen. Spent some time talking to him and taking some pictures.When I go back to Thailand, I am doing all of the remaining courses to get my certification :)Don't miss this one travellers!Have fun."

We decided to come to this school cause it was so so cheap and there were many good reviews. Honestly, my girlfriend and i left the class with back pain, since the class is conducted entirely on the floor. All in all, if you're young the class would be a lot of fun, but as we are a bit older we were not as comfortable as we would have liked."

Plus, we enjoyed some unexpected discoveries - sweeping away usual misunderstandings about unusual ingredients & cuisines!My friend and I experience french cuisine all-year-round, but we definitely love world-cuisine. We are always looking for different cooking routes and every travel is an occasion to be surprised by new flavours. In the end, we gathered a view, an understanding - + techniques - of Tha\u00ef cooking, which enabled us to better enjoy and savour our next meals. Everything was perfect from the start: booking, call-back, confirmation + precise itinerary mailing. Then, on the day, warm welcome at the place, near-market extensive visit, lively and educated introduction to Tha\u00ef cooking ingredients on the spot, grabing and smelling fresh herbs, scrubing unknow vegetables, etc. The scholl is nestled on the first floor of a nice wooden house. Our team leader, Jay, was excellent. He loves cooking, and has a unique school-teacher style, colored with numerous subtle tongue-in-cheek remarks. He drove us energetically through the whole session with undefeatable energy - bravo, Jay!This a first-class experience, with a dedicated team: have a taste of Silom, you'll be happilly surprised!"

We were divided into two groups and brought to the market and we were shown all the vegetables which and told about all the vegetables we were going to use during the course of the day.It was very enjoyable getting to prepare all the courses and getting to cook them up on the wok outside the preparation rooms. The papaya salad which we prepared was a bit too spicy for my liking, the spring rolls were very nice, the massaman curry while not the nicest we have ever had was nice but I would have preferred if we could have taken out the non edible items such as the cinnamon sticks. The pad thai we prepared was fantastic and the battered banana was delicious. By the end of the evening we were so full from all the eating.The course was fantastic value for 1,000 baht per person especially when you consider that if you eat all the items you prepare during the course of the afternoon in a restaurant in Bangkok they would probably cost more than this alone. Also you get refunded the cost of your taxi there and they give you money and advice on the best way to get back to your hotel, which all in all is excellent and a very nice way to finish a fantastic day."

Jay was our chef, he was great fun, made amazing food, explained things really well and answered all our questions - great guy. We went to market to get the ingredients, did some preparation (some done for you to allow you time to do more dishes). We each cooked at our own cooking station and then ate each dish whilst it was hot, then moved onto the next dish. If you haven't got room for all your courses then you can have it to take away with you! Great price compared to other cooking schools - only 1000Bhat per person. And they give you a refund on any taxi/transport money you spend getting to the school. We stayed near Koh San Road (other side of town) and decided to get the Orange Flag Ferry down to Central Pier (15B) then got the Skytrain to Chong Nonsi (20B) - then a 5min walk to the meeting point - for us, this trip was much more pleasant than sitting in rush hour traffic and made sure we didn't miss any of the class. They send you information and a photo of the meeting point so very easy to find. Recipe book is great, glossy, pictures, ingredients listed, steps to cook it are all explained and more recipes than you do on the day, so more to try at home. Highly recommend - enjoy!"

We came across Silom Thai cooking school and saw that it had good reviews - but the price was very reasonable!We booked the class in the evening for the next afternoon - and almost immediately we received a reply confirming that this was fine and giving us very detailed directions on where to meet them. You meet on the corner of a street in the Silom area of Bangkok - sounds a bit strange, but it's not at all! They even give you directions in Thai to show the taxi driver! We met a lady there who took us across to the market where we met our teacher, Oliver. He taught us all about the Thai ingredients and it was very interesting. We all got little baskets and we shared out the ingredients that we needed for the day and made our way to the cooking school.The building is really nice. They have a terrace area that has all of the cooking stations lined up. There is a preparation room which is brightly coloured and you all sit around on cushions learning and following your teacher. There is also a dining room where you get to enjoy all of the wonderful food! The class was so good! Oliver was an excellent teacher, and he was so so funny! His sense of humour was brilliant! We got stuck in and helped with everything, chopping up our own ingredients and helping with various things like making the thai green paste with the mortar and pestle and \"massaging\" the coconut!!It's amazing how quick and simple thai food is to make! You cook everything yourself at the stations on the terrace. When you are ready to dish up, the staff have your plate ready with some delicious accompaniment like rice and various spices etc. Then you get to EAT!Every day is a different combination of meals, but we cooked Tom Yum soup, pad thai, thai green curry, a spicy chicken salad with sticky rice and a dessert. I cannot express how good the food was! I didn't taste a nicer pad thai or thai green curry for the whole 5 weeks I was in Thailand! Delicious. Don't eat before you go to the class! We didn't and were still very full by the end! We paid 1000baht for the class which we thought was brilliant considering the great day we had, and all of the amazing food that we got to cook and eat! They even paid for our taxi to the class on top of that (90 baht) and gave us money to catch the ferry home! Such great service.Choose Silom Thai Cooking School!"

If you are looking for a school that will have you slicing/dicing ALL of the ingredients this class is not for you.The cooking schedule is well thought out and ran like clockwork. They have the itineray and menu planned very well.The food we prepared was so tasty and we were surprised that we could actually make these tasty dishes. Any food you don't finish will be packed up in take-away containers for you to take back to your hotel room."

The booking process was very simple I filled out an online form on their website and the next day they sent me an email confirmation with my booking. In a separate email they sent an extremely detailed map, 4 photographs of the meeting spot and they even provided a note to give to the taxi driver written in Thai so that I would be delivered to the right spot. They told me how long it would take to get there by taxi and roughly how much it should cost and what time to leave the hotel so that I would definitely get there. They also provided contact mobile numbers if I was to arrive late.My course started with a market tour with my instructor Jay who was just fabulous and very passionate about Thai cooking and being a teacher. He was also very funny. Jay showed us all the different produce available and then what we were going to buy for the recipes that we would be preparing.Back at the school was just the best experience, I loved all the cooking and the preparation of what is involved to make those fantastic recipes that I had been eating! 5 courses later I left extremely happy and would recommend this to anyone. It was easy and catered for every level of cook.I also went by myself but this could be done by couples and families. Jay was wonderful including a young boy who had come with his parents.I had a great day - thanks to all at the Silom Thai Cooking School."

My 2 children, aged 12 and 8 also took part and were very well looked after, the sense of achievement when they (and me) made tom yum soup, pad thai and green curry was fantastic, moreover all the courses tasted fantastic.

The staff at the school were really friendly and welcoming and the class was so well organised. The only thing I might suggest is to slow down the classes and let the students do a bit more of the preparation themselves (we were a bit spoilt and much of the preparation was done for us). This might even mean reducing the number of dishes taught but I'm sure this would give students a better idea of the work involved in preparing beautiful Thai food.The best part of the class though was our teacher Koong. She was quite contientious in educating us about thai ingredients. When we were at the market, we received a great lecture on what the ingredients were and how they were to be used. She also had a great sense of humour and an entertaining way of teaching. It was hard not to be caught up in her enthusiasm. At the end I got to take home what I couldn't eat and showed off my creations to my partner. The only regret I have is not going back for a second class while I was in Bangkok!"

Well-organized and informative, Nusi has built a great little business here sharing his expertise in Thai cooking. The market in Silom is just the right size, and teachers rapidly integrate and intrigue the group, introducing the variety of produce used in Thai cooking into the shopping. Once at the school, teachers use inventive ways to get the group involved in the preparation and cooking processes and then bringing it all together at personal burners. The recipes are simple but tasty, and the cookbook is equally clear once you return home and try to recreate what was learned in class. What I really appreciated about the Silom Thai School -- and I've gone twice now, once on my own and once with family members -- is the smooth organization they've incorporated into the class experience and the very friendly ambiance they create. Using teachers and staff, students are able to maximize their time in the classroom to ensure a variety of activities, a clean environment, and a positive experience. There is always a new bit of information or some new technique shared which makes the class worthwhile, no matter how experienced a home or trained chef you are."

There were also a lot of dishes crammed into 4 hours, it would be better as a full day course, or fewer dishes covered in more depth so we could actually cook them.

The course started in a market. It was a very simple market with nothing really interesting.Now the good things: the food was amazing!! I can't believe how simple everything was to do and how good it was to eat! It's true that many things came pre-prepared, but on my point of view just enought to skip the boring parts and going to the real fun. The teacher was really nice and explained a lot.

We went in late Dec 2011 and this was the best food we had while in Bangkok and it was enlightening to see how it all came together. 1) We chose it based on the positive reviews and its proximity to our hotel. The walk up to the building isn\u2019t to cheek, but the venue itself is clean and well organized. 2) Don\u2019t go on a full stomach \u2013 if you like Thai cuisine you will want to keep eating each dish. Luckily, you get to taste things throughout the day. It\u2019s not one big sit down meal so remember to enjoy but pace yourself throughout the half day class. 3) You start out at one of the markets where they teach you about the essential produce for Thai cooking and you get to experience how locals do their grocery shopping. 4) Ladies don\u2019t wear a skirt or dress (I made this mistake)! As per most Asian cultures you sit on the ground at the edge of a mat while preparing the food (don\u2019t worry you eat at a table). You\u2019ll be more comfortable in pants or shorts and don\u2019t have to worry about flashing anyone while getting up or down. 5) There is air conditioning. You\u2019re only outside while using the woks because there is high heat and grease so it\u2019s better to cook outside rather than in. You prepare and eat inside so don\u2019t let this deter you. 6) They give you a copy of the recipes. So when you return home you can share your Thai experience with friends and family. Overall the Silom cooking class has been a lasting positive memory for us and we always enjoy sharing stories about our experience. We\u2019d go back!"

I took three half-day classes with Nusi and Oliver during March and April 2012, and I had a great experience. I had no problems with communication or transportation, plus the price was lower than most.I did read the few negative reviews here and offer this response:- The food I ate tasted very much like what I eat on the street and in restaurants, and I've been living here in Bangkok for six months, so yes -- I think you can call the results authentic. We made coconut milk and red/green curry paste from scratch - they were right on. I needed to learn about the raw ingredients, and that definitely happened -- excellent beginner training.- They do try to cram about five different dishes into a half-day. The result is that 1-2 of them are mostly made for you, and then you do the final heating in the wok -- not the best way to teach and learn. Personally, I would rather create all that I eat there, even if that means I get to try less dishes.- If you are already a serious and experienced Asian cook, this may not be the best place for you, as much of the instruction may be redundant, and you may want a different experience.After three classes, I feel ready to move on to something more advanced. All in all, I am glad I did it. I can now create, at home, numerous Thai dishes (that Thai locals have tried and given me a thumbs-up for)!"

After receiving very clear instructions from Silom cooking school as to where to meet before our market we met our guide at the sky train station and of course she was on time and ready to go. We headed down to the morning market where we met Oliver who was our teacher for the day. Oliver was very good and funny keeping the tour and class very informative and entertaining. We learnt 4 dishes on the day and all of which were amazing. The school was well presented and very clean and without doubt my next trip back to Bangkok will include another visit to Silom cooking school. Thankyou for a great day!!!"

Our first plan is to go to Pathaya or samui island were one of the best thai cooking school can be found. But unfortunately, there is a little bit of difficulty arranging our scheds due to limited time. Anyhow, the timing favored us because when i booked our Hotel in Bangkok, Silom Thai cooking school appeared. At the end we took a 3 days cooking class to earn a certificate also (They only issue certificate for 3 or more days of classes). It is a great experience because, we not only learned how Thai people prepare their food in their native way and tradition but also to explore the hidden beauties of bangkok. Thank you and Sawasdeekrap"

Classes are part practical and part demonstration. Most of the instructions were done by all people to some degree. There were sixteen people in the class which made for a tight fit, but everyone had fun.Be prepared to sit on the floor a lot. You sit on the floor for instruction. You sit on the floor for preparation. You sit on the floor for a little bit of the eating. If you are old like me, find an excuse to stand and stretch your legs.The cooking is done outdoors in woks over gas. It is hot! But the cooking time is minimal.All of the dishes were enjoyable, easily replicable at home and rotate daily. Wednesday afternoon dishes were Pad Thai, Green Papaya Salad, Deep Fried Spring Rolls, Musomun Chicken, Deep Fried Banana and Ice Cream.Drinking water was provided. Taxi fares were refunded by the school."

The four hour lesson included buying the ingredients at the local market and getting a run down of all the ingredients used in Thai cooking. We then made five fantastic dishes: tom yam soup (with prawns); prawn pad thai; chicken larb gai (salad); green chicken curry with homemade green curry paste and white turnip in sweet coconut cream. The food tasted fantastic and better still we were given a souvenir stir fry flip made from coconut and the recipes. All for just 1000 baht. The instructor was hilarious and very good value. I highly recommend this cooking school."

The school refunds you for any transportation costs and they give very clear instructions on how to get there or where and when to meet for pick up. The class starts off with a trip to the market where you pick up all the ingredients. Then you head back to the school to prepare the vegetables and then prepare to cook the dishes one at a time. Some will say the cooking class is too easy, but it is still very hands on. We squeezed our own coconut cream, chopped all our vegetables, and made red curry paste by pounding chilli and seasoning with mortar and pestle. For 1000 Baht/person, this class is great! The instructor was also very funny and made the whole experience very enjoyable. I would most definitely recommend the Silom Thai Cooking School for a cooking class in Bangkok!!"

He explained what each ingredient was and how it was used. Before cooking each meal, we spent some time washing, peeling and preparing the ingredients. The school is beautiful and very welcoming. I loved how we cooked one dish at a time and worked on our own individual work station. I was happy to make my own dish and taste it. Through everything, Oliver and the other staff members helped us and answered our questions without being overbearing or patronizing.

Keep up the good work Nusi, you would be proud of me - i enjoy a Thai meal once or twice a week back in South Africa.

So i ended up having 6 dishes/session, no additional charge :). The key thing is that they make it so easy, that give us extra confident to make this at home :). Price is pretty good too, comparing to all other cooking school, and they reimburse for our transportation cost, so end up about 900/class.

They take great care of people who have not cooked before, so that they do not get hurt due to hot oil or while chopping.The menu changes every day so better opt for a day which has maximum of your favorites.

The course was not only extremely easy to follow and informative but it was also a lot of fun. I cannot remember having such a laugh while learning something useful. Since getting home, I've often used the booklet provided to us after the course, added my own choice ingredients and every dish has been a success. Both family and friends have been wowed with my Thai cooking. I never would have thought it was as easy as it is but it was thanks to Nusi's teaching skills and the Silom Cooking school that I now always have lemon grass, kefir limes and lots of chilli in my kitchen.

I searched cooking schools in Bangkok, and several came up, but because of location and menu I chose Silom.Course lasts about 5 hours, and the menue changes from day to day. First a trip to the local wet-marked, to learn about the different ingrediences, and then back to school. Cleaning, chopping, cooking and then eating what you've just made, can't be better than that! The instructors we had was fun and easygoing, spoke wonderful English, and I will be back there on my next visit to Bangkok. Bring a camera, and a friend if you want to, and get cooking!! You get a recipe booklet afterwards, so no need to write down anything. I loved the whole experience, and they even catered for my food allergies. Book early, course seem to be very popular, maybe also due to the price, a very reasonable charge!! Kob koon kaa :-)"

Three of us took one of Nusi's cooking classes where we learned to cook a good variety of dishes, checked out a local market, learned what chili was for what - need I go on. It was the best investment of my entire 2 1/2 week visit to Thailand. Nusi is fun and informative and imparts knowledge with ease. I'd recommend this to anyone who would like to have a go at recreating Thai food at home. The class was a large one, yet we all worked together and had time to chat and get to know one another too. I took a different cooking course on Phuket which was 3 times the price, one hour longer and they came nowhere near to what Nusi taught us. He didn't chat on his mobile phone and was entertaining every moment - it's a well oiled operation. The market visit was a little more difficult as the space is restricted and not everyone can stand near enough to hear everything but it taught me how the Thais shop and what they buy and why. Excellent morning, would recommend to anyone interested in learning Thai cookery."

My husband and I debated on taking a cooking class because of our busy schedule during our 4 day stay in Bangkok, so we ended up booking a class on the morning of our departure date. We booked this one because it was in walking distance from our hotel (Lebua at State Tower) and had a good review.I made an online reservation using their website and received a call about 5 minutes later to confirm my reservation. They sent me an instructions on how to get to the meeting place and a map to my hotel room that night.The instructor was very knowledgeable and explained everything very easy and simple, even my husband who is not into cooking enjoyed the class and said it was one of the best activities we did in Bangkok.The instructor took the students (8-10 people) to a local market and explained Thai ingredients and bought them right there. Every student was given a small shopping basket with a cold water bottle and we carried the ingredients to the school which was about 5 minute walk from the market.The presentation was beautiful and the instructor added finishing touches to the dishes that the students prepared. All the dishes were so pretty so your food looks like it was prepared by a chef. All dishes we made were the best I had in Thailand.Highly recommend this cooking school to anyone who visits Bangkok."

It was a fantastic was to start my holiday and I thoroughly enjoyed the tantalising experience. Nusi, the teacher, is an excellent teacher with a funny side to him. I really enjoyed his sense of humour. The morning started with a trip to a local market followed by cooking 5 dishes. The Pad Thai was one of the best I've tasted in Thailand and I made it myself (with Nusi's help of course). If it's your first visit to Thailand, this is a fantastic was to experience popular thai dishes and you could order it again if you enjoyed what you made. Other cooking courses are 1800 baht + but Nusi charges 1000 baht which is a good price for what you get. I would love to go back again. Nusi is very good at responding to emails.Hassan"

She said both were pretty similar, but she enjoyed Silom a little better so we booked a reservation with them.We got picked up by the Nusi by the Chong Nosi train station. Others met up with us and then he gave us 40 Baht, a cell phone, and a map and hailed cabs for us to the meeting spot. After everyone had gathered, he took us shopping at a market across the street. At the market, he pointed out everything that we would need for that day and talked about the different types of well, everything. After we had gotten what we needed, we walked a short distance to the school. He and his team taught us how to prepare the ingredients (how to clean and cut the vegetables, how to cut chicken or peel shrimp, how to make coconut milk) and then taught us how to cook! We made five dishes \u2013 tom yum soup, pad thai, chicken salad, green curry, and sticky rice in coconut milk with mango. Everything was delicious! At the end, he gave us all a cookbook with the recipes we made and then some. I thought it was also very nice of him to give money to everyone for their travel back to their hotels. I don't actually cook and I am lucky that my husband enjoys doing so. Usually I feel a little intimidated by these classes, but Nusi made you feel comfortable! I may actually start cooking ;) It was a very entertaining, very informative, and fun experience. And we highly recommend!"

After shopping, it's a quick walk back to his house which has been carefully tweaked to provide ample room for up to 14 people per class.Nusi gives a very informative lesson, explaining the at behind each dish and encouraging you to get involved in both preparation and cooking. You follow a 7 course menu (don't have breakfast!) which varies each day. He is helped by a team of friendly and hard working assistants who help to make the experience enjoyable.All of us loved the experience which is a unique insight into Thai cooking. At 1,000 baht per person it may at surface value seem expensive but believe me, it's great value and you will come away happy.thanksjames & muneeza"

After the market, we went to his cooking school on foot. His cooking school was on the fourth floor of a local residential. We all pu ton an apron, and then we were taught how to wash and clean the ingredents.Nusi was an organized and well prepared man. His cooking methods were simple and easy to learn.

The kitchen was not stainless and sterile - there are other venues offering that. Cooking outside (without airconditioning) on the terrace overlooking other flats was a treat.

Don't be alarmed by the walk there; this is not the scene from a tourist brochure, but any Bangkok veteran knows that looks can be very deceiving. Yes, the area would be considered less classy to some, but his school is, as mentioned before, clean.Nusi pays for your transportation, and is very generous with reimbursing you for your travel, something I've never heard about before here. His school is a close walk from the Narai hotel, and the market is close as well. His school is decorated with pictures of his travels. After working in Bangkok for a short while, I am happy to see someone who has marketed their skills properly and done something other than waiting for someone to give them money. He has truly created something successful, and for that I am happy!This is an ideal class for beginners. We learned a lot about ingredients, and were taught the very basics of Thai cuisine. The pad thai and tom yum we made were amoung the best I've had since moving here to Bangkok. This is not however, a class for those who are experienced cooks. Having said that, I will say that there are changes that need to be made; Nusi himself. He spent the whole time answering his cell phone, which annoyed us to no end. I understand that he had business calling, but a simple \"I'm sorry, I have to take this\" would have sufficed. Or better yet, putting the phone on silent mode and calling whoever back when he had the time. He should also mark a good time to call on his website.He was very rude and dismissive, shouting out orders and at one point became very aggitated when some people forgot their plate of ingredients outside, saying something along the lines of \"I said it before in English and I know my English is good enough\" (in Thai-English) . That pretty much marked the end of my defending him; until that point, I figured that there was mostly a language and cultural barrier that made him sound so impolite. But as the day progressed, he got sassier and sassier!For those of you on a tight budget with a very easy-going nature who want a basic intro to Thai cuisine, this is your class. But for those of you who expect something a little less... military... go somewhere else.Please note that you will have to sit on the floor to prepare the ingredients. Anyone with back or knee or any kind of problem that would make this difficult should inform him in advance."

Went on a Monday, so the three hands-on dishes were tom yam soup, pad thai and green curry chicken (with all students chipping in to prepare the curry paste and we all made the coconut milk from coconut flesh). The menu is in fact very ordinary but one gets to experience how the dishes are prepared from scratch. I have enjoyed the class but I would say for those who don't want to be too hands on it might be better to shop around for other cooking classes in the city.

All participants in our group were in their 20s and 30s. The class had a budget feel to it, which was appropriate for the cost. The explanations were not that detailed, and Nusi does seem slightly burnt out from running two classes a day. If you are looking for a reasonably priced, standard introduction to Thai cooking you will enjoy the class. If you have a prior knowledge of Thai cooking and a bigger budget, you may want to go more upmarket.

As others have said there is no pick-up service. I recieved a fax at the hotel to meet at a skytrain station (my husband accompaanied me- as you can imagine I thought this a bit odd). There were 2 others also waiting. The man - lucy? arrived and we all got in a taxi to the hotel where the others were waiting.We arrived at the market - first a vegetable stall where we got baskets and water, then to a fish and meat market (a very clean and sterile one!!) where we bought ingredients for the food. Several times we had a short lecture on noodles, or whatever. Then back to the veg stall and quite an informativen lecture on the veg. Eveyone ended up with a basket full of produce.On to the apartment which was very hot - I am afraid the fans were not up to the job that day. It soon became clear that there were 15 people in a spaceeant for a maximum of 12. This was fine whilst we prepared the shrimp, chicken and veg (even though we had to sit on the floor to do this - not something mentioned in the advertising) but when the cooking started 3 people had to be a second shift cooking and eating seperately. What made this worse was that instead of choosing 3 different people for eaach course the same 3 continued, even though others offered to take their places. Naturally the 3 felt a little excluded but they took it in stride.We had good information during the preparation but the cooking phase was a bit rushed with the assistant having already put out the sauces etc..I am an erxperienced cook and , although I did get a lot of information from this course, I was a bit annoyed by the crowded environment (we met at 8.30 and left at 3pm so it was a long day and very hot) and the lack of detailed information on the cooking techniques.I chose this course as I thought it would be more down to earth and less 'sterile' than the others and not only because of the price.

Our teacher did not explain about the way to cook and was always in a hurry.The third dish, a Larb Gai, was rediculous. Everything was prepared and the teacher just showed us how to throw the ingredients together. No word about the preparation of the meet, no word about the other ingredients. After 3 minutes his basic words: \"Enjoy\"!The Thai Curry was the next dish - frankly to say: I can do better. But this was not all: the cooking was more or less to heat the ingredients, because everything was already prepared.

The organisation of this can be a bit haphazard, most people waiting randomly in the lobby not knowing who to look for. He then takes you to the local market, and buys the ingredients with you, giving you a short and fairly random lessons on the types of food available.His class is held in a local converted apartment. No aircon, but plenty of fans, which is bearable. The group washes, chops, grinds and then cooks each dish under his instruction and gaze. You get through about 5 simple dishes in a lesson, which is quite satisfying on the brain and on the stomach. Nusi is a strange character. Slightly rude but funny at the same time. Maybe as a previous chef, this is what you get - just think of some of the chefs you see on TV! He does seem a little burnt out though, probably from taking two lessons a day, 7 days a week. Overall, don't expect in-depth high level cooking education. Expect a good time and you'll enjoy it. And at 1000 THB, it's half the price of many similar classes around.

We cooked: fried rice, spring rolls, fried bananas, red curry with noodles and a som tam. I felt a lot of the dishes were \"toned down\" for european tastes (e.g. the som tam I ate around town had a really intense fermented fish or crab taste but this one was pretty tame! as was the curry).It was interesting to do some kind of \"activity\" on my trip but if you are a bit of a foodie then don't expect to be \"stretched\" on this course. The trouble is, from my research, cooking schools in bangkok tend to be \"rustic/down home but introductory\" (this one) or otherwise very \"upmarket\" (Blue Elephant etc) - but there doesnt seem to be one which caters for people who want to learn about rustic (ie not fancy Royal Thai) food but who already have a fairly good knowledge of thai cuisine/ingredients AND who want something relatively cheap (from memory the Blue Elephant/Hotel schools were charging in the region of $100 + USD whereas Silom only charges about $30USD.So I think there is a bit of a gap in the market for a cooking course in Bangkok which teaches homestyle cooking in a relatively basic setting (like Silom) but that goes into more depth about the ingredients, history etc so that people with a basic understanding/experience of thai food and cooking will still get a lot out of it.I have heard from other people there are a lot more cooking schools to choose from in Chang Mai - so if you are travelling there you may want to give Bangkok a miss as i would imagine if there are more options in Chang Mai its more likely you will find a better course.So all in all - I had fun but didnt really learn much - as a way to occupy a morning and have something to eat it was OK but definitely not that memorable."

First the tutor took us to a typical Thai market and gave brief explanations on different spices, fish & ... Then we went to the \"school\" to wash and sort out the ingredients. There was no air con - only fans - which made the experience really hot and sticky. The tutor was a character... a bit moody and not as nice as most other people you will meet at random in Thailand. Anyway, he did teach us all that was stated in the menu... it was a group effort and I loved interacting with people of different cultures and countries. He did also pay for travel expences - to and from the school.However, since I am a bit of a cook at home and kinda know the basics, it did not live up to what I thought it would be.I would recommend this for people who do not cook regularly and want to learn the basics of Thai cooking. Also, for individuals who live in Europe, US - the whole washing dirty vegetables, skinning shrimp and doing everything from scratch does appeal - I relate to that. But since where I come from we do this on a daily basis, the novelty has worn off. Altogether it was not bad. I felt reviews were very overrated."

I have always loved Thai food, and when I found out about this school, I signed up for 2 lessons (choosing the menus which had most of my favourite dishes!)My husband was initially apprehensive about accompanying me, but he was completely won over by the end of the first lesson. We were fortunate to be in a very small class on the first day, so we had a wonderful time chatting, while cutting, dicing, chopping and pounding away, Nusi first brought us to the market, and it was fascinating to learn about the different types of basil, ginger etc that are used in Thai cuisine. We were then taught how to prepare all the dishes from scratch, from washing the ingredients, to cutting them up, and finally mixing them up and cooking them. He taught us in a way that made it seem so easy! We initially had doubts when he told us not to have a heavy lunch before going...we wondered if we could come up with something edible! So we were pleasantly surprised by what we managed to cook: the dishes were all delicious!We have no regrets signing up for the cooking class. It added a different dimension to our holiday, and enriched it beyond the usual shop/eat/temple experiences. What's more, I can now replicate some of my holiday experience for my family at home! Highly recommended. Keep at least half a day aside for this!!!"

I signed up for a cooking class with the Silom Thai Cooking School. This class cost just a little over half the cost of other schools I had researched. The class included transport from my hotel. The day started with a visit to the market to purchase the ingredients. We then prepared and ate five different courses. The menu changes each day.I had so much fun. It was a great way to meet people and spend a morning. If I had more time, I would have attended additional classes.This class is not 5 star in terms of commercial kitchens, but offers so much more in the way of culture and a Thai experience."

He starts off the class by showing us how to clean and prepare the various ingredients, including making our own cocunut milk and curry paste (instead of buying them ready from the market).We then cook five courses of Thai food, taking a break each to enjoy our \"masterpiece\". For someone totally ignorant of cooking, I find myself learning quite a bit about cooking and surprisingly the food is delicious!Nusi is very professional and speaks good English.

Nusi not only knows his stuff but knows how to teach it, in a clear and fun style making each day something to look forward to. the school is not a stainless steel palace like Rick Stiens place. but is one floor of a newish appartment block, bright and airey and kept very clean and fresh by Nari and his staff, you dont have to wash up!

The round we made at the market was an eye opener as we got introduced to many local vegetables/ herbs that we never knew existed. Then we proceeded to prepare the ingredients and make every dish from scratch. The dishes that we cooked were exceptionally good (and by the way, we do have high standards!) Without exaggeration, his Thai green curry was the best we've ever had - we were shocked that our favourite version came from a cooking class rather than a local eatery/ restaurant!We also think that the course fees are very reasonable at THB1000/ person (compared to some other courses charging double this). In all, the experience exceeded our expectation and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great way to spend half a day in the city."

The school did an excellent job on providing detailed materials on how to prepare the dishes, what the dish looked like, and what ingredients to use. This was a great resource because you could really sit and listen versus worrying about taking a million notes and pictures. He would pass out samples and consistently call to the class to keep everyone engaged. Him and his assistant are with you every step of the way so it's almost impossible to mess up.Our chef did a wonderful job on explaining each ingredient, the history of them, where they are from, and great alternatives to use if you are from different areas of the world.My suggestion to everyone is to check the menus before you go because everyday is a different meal. At the end you have a group lunch and enjoy all your dishes together. A truly must do while in Bangkok!"

We have done many other cooking classes on various trips and this cooking school is by far the most professional. We were able to book our class immediately for that day and they were able to accommodate my food allergy. The first thing I noticed was how clean everything was, the presentation area, the ingredients, the cooking area, the chefs themselves, everything was sparkling clean. The class was small, only 4 of us, which is important to note, they do not cancel classes because of small sizes. It was a formal but intimate setting with lots of personal attention. The class was very informative, with lots of detail explaining the difference in ingredients as well as the processes of making certain ingredients. There were pictures, flash cards, and we were encouraged to taste everything. The class is set up in a way where the head chef explains the dish about to be prepared and all the ingredients to be used. This is where the tasting of individual ingredients occurs. Then we move to the cooking area where they was chef will demonstrate how to prep the ingredients for cooking. The tasks are divided among all parties so everyone gets to participate. The best part, you get to eat the food you cook together and it is all prepared for individual presentation by the assistant chefs, it is not served family- style. We received a parting gift and a certificate upon completing the class. I enjoyed the experience so much I returned the following day to participate in another class while my husband was on business. The menu was completely different and I was the solo participant. The school did not close merely because only I had registered for the class. This was an outstanding experience, if you are looking for a professional, educational and super clean cooking class, do not miss this cooking school!"

One day I was the only student so I got a privat lesson. The other days we where in two or four people. The stuff around the Chef is very nice and always helpful! They prepare a lot of things and clean the working stations after - I already miss that at my home ;-))The recipes are based on the traditionell Thai-Kitchen- no crossover. I learnd a lot about the ingredients. Back to Germany it's hard to get them really fresh :( The Cooking School is located across the river opposit the Oriental Hotel. You can easily take the shuttle boat from the Oriental Hotel. The school itself is situated in a very nice ancient wooden building. I definately raccomand this cooking school - even if You haven't much time in Bangkok You could spend only one or two days like most of the people do.

Overall, it was worth the cost of admission and then some. I also wish there was a cookbook available but literally that's the only complaint I could possibly have."

The Oriental Cooking School is the first cooking school in Bangkok and it is definitely the place where one should go if they are looking for a place to get to know Thai cooking. Chef Narain is the famous Chef who taught us how to cook some Thai dishes. He and his assistants did a great job conducting the class, do the preparations and assist us to do the cooking itself. The day me and the group attended the class, we were introduced how to cook the Curried Shrimp Paste Dip, Stir-fried beef with green curried paste & papaya, chicken in coconut milk with Galangal, and pumpkin custard for dessert. The class itself was conducted in a very enjoyable manner that students will not get bored and lose attention. Chef also did a great job with giving examples that are easy to remember, He also have a great sense of humour. Overall me and the group enjoyed the cooking class."

One must spend a whole morning and up to around 1330 to attend a daily morning class (menus change daily each day of the week, and for seasons), if not for catered classes . Also, like other famous afternoon tea, etc., very advance reservation esp. for holiday high season if making outside of hotel (one's home outside bangkok, etc.) is pressed. There were 4 tables allowing about 4 persons to share the \"highlights\" of cooking tasks after seeing the chef teacher demonstrate and explain in the separate \"classroom\" rather than each person being responsible for own pot and pan going directly to be comsumed by self (like in blue elephant cooking school). At the end of the \"cooking and preparation session\" mostly done by staff who may outnumber the students, everyone is seated at one table to enjoy the prettily arranged lunch menu. There are explanation of thai food ingredients in general using supplementary materials, and notes are neatly arranged when one returns from \"cooking session\" to \"classroom\" as well as welcome sweets and drink in the same way (hotel fairies here as well?) At the end of the class, everyone receive award-like certificate and an original apron and cloth bag filled with spices to take home. Hotel guests receive 10% discount, and majority of the attendants come from the premise, while others also enjoy these pampered cooking/dining/cultural experience."

Talking about the Chef, chef Narain, was simply amazing, knowledgeable and very hospitality. The food was also wonderful and super fun. We also learned a lot of great, practical cooking tips and mastered the art of Thai cuisine. I wish they had a signature cookbook.

You get an explanation of ingredients, chance to buy whatever you want. After walking for some time you finish the market tour and get a nice cold bottle of water while we wait for the pick up towards the cooking class. The rest of the team has prepped the ingredients and you are ready to start cooking in groups of 6. Great explanation is given. Simple yet delicious dishes are cooked and eaten by you directly.

I've already cooked one of the dishes since returning home thanks to the excellent instruction and recipes given out at the end.I also came away inspired by Poo who has not only started the school, but she is helping her entire community to thrive thanks to her kind, generous nurturing spirit.I cooked on my own as my husband was working and everyone was so friendly - it would be a great work trip or experience with friends.I liked that although I know there are plenty of more formal cooking courses in Bangkok this felt very authentic in the set-up, going to the market and being within the local community - AND that I've come away inspired to actually try the recipes rather than feeling that I'd never cook them due to them being too complicated etc...It was more than just a cooking lesson, thank you to Poo and her amazing friends for an unforgettable experience."

A really humbling and important experience to see and support the poor people whilst having fun and learning how to cook authentic Thai food! Poo gives the course little personal touches like a free bag of recipes and I really recommend choosing this cooking course as they go out of their way to make you enjoy yourself whilst feeling you really have supported a great cause.

Then we were shown how to cook four separate and all equally yummy and amazing dishes by Poo herself. The ingredients were fresh and tasty and the instructions were easy to follow.

Don't let the word \"slum\" scare you, as the area, and school itself are very safe. I really liked the school in particular, it was colorful, clean and inviting. Most of the prep work will be done for you, so all you'll have to do is slice, dice and stir your way to some delicious dishes. The staff is also very helpful in suggesting alternate ingredients, and give you a nice little bag with the days recipes in it (although I highly recommend getting the cook book also!). Again, highly recommended, the only word of warning I have is not to make lunch plans after! Between the 3 dishes you make and the fruit and desert sampling at the end, you'll probably be stuffed!

In the same time to do some good for Poo's community!Easy to book from her website, you get detailled instructions where to come before the class (remember to reserve enough time especially in the morning because of the traffic - even in the BTS). After gathering in front of the hotel You get to experience the market where the ingredience for the cooking is acquired. You can also purchase some for Yourself if You want to. After market You head to the kitchen to do the cooking. When You make the reservation You can choose what kind of menu You want to cook. You have a chance to cook three different cources and also enjoy Your cooking as You get to eat Your own creation between the cooking.After cooking You can purchase for example the Poo's cook book (definitely recommend!) or some other items. They also drive You back to the meeting place, so You have the rest of the day to do some other things (and definitely don't have to think of eating anything else for the rest of the day because You have just eaten four-course lunch!).10+ for the experience! Also a good way to meet like-minded travellers while cooking!All the best for Poo and her friends, keep doing the good job!"

            "review": "Cooking with Poo was a highlight of our trip. My 21 year old daughter and i heard about this cooking class from a fellow South African who raved about the class. I am so glad we went with this particular food tour. We were collected at the Emporium Hotel as promised, right on time by the cooking school - taken to Klong Toey market which was so interesting. It was lovely to have the different food stuffs explained. We were shown all types of weird and wonderful vegetables and fruits as well of loads of live produce. The journey to the \"slum\" area where the school is was comfortable in the aircon van. We were given bottled water to cool down in the vehicle. On arrival we were enthusiastically invited in down a long narrow walkway between the houses to the cooking school. Once at the school - a small house - we were shown the cooking stations (8 in total) where the group of 16 cooked 3 dishes in 2 shifts each. We got to eat what we made. Poo is delightful (and so are her friends) and spent time telling us how her school came about. We were offered a chance to buy her book (which is lovely by the way) as well as some fun souvenirs. Right opposite Poo's doorway is a small shop where the local people (Helping Hands) can exhibit their goods for sale. This is definitely a good cause and an authentic experience that i would do again if i came back to Bangkok."

Poo's driver was about 1/2 hr late but they dropped us off about an hour late too. The group we had was about 10, including people from the states, Australia, New Zealand, Europe...it felt like a family and it was nice to cook and eat together and hear everyone's stories. The market experience was amazing, like no market I've seen. Live animals, huge variety of local fruits, curries, sweets, anything you can think of, they had. We wore sneakers and glad we did as the wet market is truly wet. The cooking was unbelievably easy and we received the recipes to take home in a homemade sack."

I picked this class because it is about supporting a community as well as learning about ingredients and techniques. All the team made this expererience great for me and them. We started with the fresh market. The day before I visited the same market with my daughters, but having Noi to explain and answer our questions was very precious, and made the visit way more enjoyable for the kids! They loved the fact that everybody was very nice and attentive.The team understands that if one of them doesn't like an ingredient or has allergies, there is no fuss about it, and an alternative is suggested. The explanations/demonstrations were clear and simple, so the kids could start right away. It was fun, delicious, relaxed and interesting. The flow of the class was well orchestrated between setting up the ingredients, explaining the dish, preparing , cooking, cleaning and tasting it. All this is only possible with a great team work from the helpers that are working in the kitchen. All the left overs were packed away, ready to take out. We picked a Wednesday so we could learn the pad thai and the coconut soup, my kids favorite!Poo has a great sense of humor and she is passionate about her food. She truly enjoys sharing her knowledge, and more so she loves people. She is sharing with us her amazing story, and all the positive outcomes for the neighborhood. We were lucky that she was there that day.Me and my daughters got a great experience, and we highly recommend to choose that class. It was our first cooking class ever, first time in east Asia ever. We bought all the ingredients and cooking ustensils in Bangkok the next days to keep the culinary experience up as we brought back home her cooking book!Thank you so much for opening your kitchen!Marion, Maena et Am\u00e9lie."

I was looking for a casual cooking school in Bangkok that wasn't going to break the bank (Mandarin Oriental) and wasn't going to take all day (I had to attend a scavenger hunt organized by our hosts starting at 1:15pm at Lumpini Park). Long story short, Poo's cooking school was wonderful. The walk-through the busy morning market supercharged the senses, at times was harrowing and overwhelming, but got me ready to cook and EAT! The school itself is tucked away in the neighborhood where Poo grew up. No frills, honest, inspired little cooking school. The dishes were 1/2 prepared, so we mostly did some chopping and then, as most Thai food goes, just turned the burner on high and in 5 minutes it was ready ... and delicious. Just an FYI, in case you're thinking you'll be contemplating and dissecting a recipe for an hour. This is all very quick, which was perfect for my schedule. We prepared three dishes (beef salad, shrimp pad thai, and green curry) and then gorged on mango/sticky rice and a table's worth of exotic and local fruits from the market. Poo is wonderful, obviously. And her team is fantastic. Can't recommend this enough, especially for a curious amateur cook looking for a fun 1/2 day diversion and who thinks more like Anthony Bourdain and less like some Michelin chef in terms of what a foreign \"cooking school\" should deliver."

You are met and taken in a minibus to Bangkok's main market. It's not for the fainthearted but totally fascinating and a real experience. From there you are then taken to Poo's cookery school in the slum area where she first started cooking. Each time I've been we've cook 3 different dishes and then finished off with a whole rage of unusual fruits to try. The staff and Poo are all friendly and knowledgable. The food you cook is delicious and easy to follow. Don't eat before you go, you'll have plenty of yummy food while you're there!"

We particularly enjoyed the trip round the market initially and it was a real assault on the senses! We enjoyed the fact that the cooking school is in the slums where Poo used to live. The house has been converted into a small cooking school which thankfully is air-conditioned. The cooking was easy and with the book we purchased we will definitely do it at home. Our friends really like the apron we also bought which says 'I cooked with POO and I liked it!'"

As a self proclaimed foodie, I got really excited when I first heard what we were doing, although I will admit, I was taken aback by the name! First part of the tour/class kicks of in Khlong Toey market, which is Bangkok's biggest fresh food market. This place is not for the fainthearted as it has plenty of live animal's waiting for slaughter right in front of you. It has everything from insects to frogs, pigs to chickens, fish to vegetables and herbs. For this reason it can get a bit smelly, but you have to expect that in an open market like this. I personally enjoyed this a lot as it's a cultural insight and something so different to what you can experience compared to most western societies. Poo's team provide a guided tour and are more than happy to explain any weird and wonderful things you want to learn more about. From here you head back to Poo's kitchen which is below her house in the middle of Khlong Toey slum - this is what makes this experience even more special - but don't let this put you off. Poo's kitchen is well air conditioned, clean, and has a toilet should you need it. Her lessons and recipes are easy to follow, and all the prep apart from chopping vegetables is done for you. As part of the package Poo provides the recipes you cooked to take home with you in a nice colorful bag, handmade by a local within the slum. Not only is this a great cultural and cooking experience, Poo donates 10% of her income into the local community that has gone towards providing new roofing for her neighbors, children's books and toys, and many other great things. So in effect your helping support the slum as well. This is a must do if you have half a day spare in Bangkok and something great to do as a team, a couple, or even a group of friends."

This is a fascinating and fun experience - starting with the biggest, liveliest and in some ways most challenging market you can imagine with gizzards, intestines and chicken blood mingling with a rainbow of colour from the fruit and vegetables. The cooking itself is a combination of practical instruction, hands on practice and anecdotes of what it is like to live in the slum of 100,000 people and ways in which enterprises such as this one can help. It may not be the most culinary based form of instruction but it is a wonderful combination of the cookery information and the philanthropic. Well done to Poo and her team."

I researched several other cooking classes in Bangkok and I'm so glad we chose this one. We were lucky to get in on a cancellation because the class was fully booked during our stay in Bangkok. I really like the small business/family ownership story Poo tells of the beginnings of her cooking class. It was easy to find the meeting point in the morning and the van was on time to pick everyone up. First we went to a food market and toured around, learning about the different foods eaten in Thailand. We had the opportunity to buy things as we walked through and our guide was very helpful in explaining what things were and the cost. Then we were back in the van to the cooking school, set in the slums of Bangkok. The school is modest, but everyone had space to sit, cook and eat together. We had an appetizer, soup, main meal and dessert. The food was wonderful and I've tried several different recipes from the cookbook I bought while there. At the end, Poo put out 10 different kinds of fruit, ordered from least sweet to most sweet. I really enjoyed trying some fruits I had never heard of before but had just seen in the market that morning. I also enjoyed shopping for some homemade goods after the class. These products were made by families who had started small businesses with help from Poo and the profits she makes from her cooking classes. Again, I'm so glad we chose this class as opposed to one of the cooking classes offered by the big hotels. And the price was right, too. About half the price of other classes. Thank you for the wonderful experience, Poo and friends!"

Lots of colours, textures, flavours and live animals. Once back in the kitchen we learnt how to cook delicious Thai dishes such as Lemon grass salad, Phad Thai and Massaman curry. The methods were simplified down into such manageable steps that even those who can't cook/won't cook would feel a real sense of achievement. The best part was eating your own creation.

Poo then herds the cooking team to her humble kitchen, located within the slums. Notice the walkways and the modest homes. Put your apron on and get busy as this queen of Thai cooking shows everyone how is done. Do not worry -- everyone gets it right eventually!

We not only met the amazingly resourceful Thai women, but also a group of ten other tourists from five countries. We shared the van ride together and the visit through the Klong Toey Market...amazing in itself. Then we were taken to the cooking class kitchen for a well-organized class wherein we cooked three delicious dishes and were served a tasty dessert of sticky rice and mango. We received the recipes and visited across the way where we could make purchases of craft items made by women in the area, if we were so inclined.(no pressure). My husband and I both thought this was one of the best experiences of our Bangkok trip...we loved it. This woman is an entrepreneur who is looking out for her neighbors too. She and her assistants run an efficient school for those interesting in learning about Thai cooking basics."

Everything is well organized. The only thing I was a little dissapointed of, was that we where a quite big group of 13 people, and that the stroll throug the market went too quicly to get it all - but I suppose I had too high expectations. In all the day was great, I got the book, and now I feel confident in cooking a lot of thai-dishes and buy food on the market myself. I hope to visit Poo again some other time and another menu (just pick another day).Thank you Poo!"

But I left it too late and it was booked up. So I booked as soon as I knew what dates we would be in Bangkok this year. So my advice is book early! We had an instructive visit to Klong Toei wet market, a place I wouldn't have ventured into on my own. Khun Poo guided us around, explaining, answering questions and buying ingredients for the class as we went. And then onto the little cooking school, where we cooked a range of dishes, ably assisted by Poo and her colleagues. We ate our creations as we went along, but by the end we were much too full and donated our our surplus to Poo's neighbours in the slums.It was great fun, and gave me more insights into how to cook authentic Thai dishes at home. We were given the printed recipes in little drawstring cotton bags made by another fledgling business in the slums, and had an opportunity to buy gifts made by more enterprises. It was wonderful to see how much impact Poo's resourcefulness is having on the whole community. My husband wasn't very keen on going when I booked up, but he was really pleased I persuaded him, (and now he can cook Thai food for me!)"

Then we got in the van and went to Poo's cooking school. She demonstrated a dish and then we made it ourselves, each with our own burner. The dishes were easy to make and delicious yet still healthy. Poo explained how her business has helped so many others start small businesses in Klong Toei: the woman who makes her cooking aprons, t-shirts, bags to hold the recipes, a cookbook, and the woman selling handicrafts across the alley.

The school is well organised, a clean well maintained bus picks you up and stops off at the slum market for a quick tour and an opportunity to buy really really cheap and delicious fruit and other food.

The trip to the market first thing was a bit stomach-turning. Vegetarians beware. The sight of all the animals in cramped cages waiting to be killed was difficult to see. As were the pig's heads and carcasses strewn about. However, I'm so glad I went as it made me respect where my food comes from even more. You can see lots of insects, toads and rats for sale as well and the smell is something else for sure! However Poo and Tai lead you through the stalls with patience and with an expertise honed through many years of daily visits. The class we basic, so suitable for all ages; there were some kids in our class. But still, there was a lot to learn and Poo and her team made it fun and the food was superb! You get the chance to take photos as well as buy merchandise from Poo and others in the area once all the food has been cooked (and devoured.) as a treat they also laid out 10 different Thai fruits for us all to try.

The van is brand new and very comfortable and spacious. The groups are small so it is easy to talk to the guide and comfortable because you don't feel like you are in a big crowd. The tour of the market is un forgettable and so much better then going on your own because you can ask what everything is, and you can have the opportunity to pick up a few things at the kitchen supplies shop int he market that you can't find elsewhere. Once at the cooking school it is very clean, and very organised. Once again because the group is small you don't have to wait in line for anything and everything is ready for you. It is avery friendly and happy place to spend the morning. Afterword we had the opportunity to help a neighbour by purchasing things from her small shop so that she can send her children to school.

As all the other reviews say it really is an amazing experience doing 'Cooking With Poo' Booking was easy using her website and you can pay through PayPal. You can see the recipes for different days on the website so you can choose your day to coincide with your favourite dishes.If you like cooking or even if you don't it's such a fun experience. We met her staff at the Emporium in Central Bangkok early in the morning at 830am. If you arrive early there is a Starbucks and Au Bon Pain inside the Emporium Suites on the first level to grab a drink or breakfast but don't eat too much because there is lots of food to eat that you cook. Their driver took us to the local market to see all produce available in Thailand. There is so much to see (and smell omg), meat, chickens, insects and frogs!! The guide explained so much about the market and the different fruits. The floor is quite wet and sometimes slippery in places, be careful. You can buy anything you see while on the tour so bring money with you. The market visit is not for the faint hearted and you can stay in the van if you don't think you can stomach it. After the market you jump back in the van and are taken to the Cooking place. You do have to walk a little to get to the actual place but it's quite straightforward and the you are with Poo's staff. We are made to feel so welcome by Poo and her staff. Even thought you are with other people you are put a ease very quickly. We washed hands, put on our aprons and got to work. Poo explained each and every ingredient she used and even catered for special dietary requirements. Being allergic to fish is hard in Thailand as fish sauce is used in lots of recipes but Poo was so good and suggested alternatives for me like using Soy sauce instead. We made 3 dishes each. After each dish you got to eat it. It tasted like it had been made by a professional not by me. Delicious! Once we finished cooking we were given an array of fruits to try, all that we had earlier seen in the market. Brilliant tastes. And the finale was the Thai sticky rice and mango. My goodness how good it was. You must try it, don't be put off.  Take money with you as there a few bits to buy like aprons, cooking books and T-shirts. You also get to take the recipes we cooked home so you don't forget the details. You get dropped back to The Emporium around 12:30pm. Poo explains her story as she goes along and is to be admired for the work she does tirelessly in her community. It's a worthwhile experience to do especially knowing that some of your money goes directly back to community. Well Done Poo..."

Make sure to not wear flip flops (which I did) as the floor is a bit messy. I really enjoyed the market tour. We then hopped back into the van and met with Poo at her home where the cooking class takes place. It is very apparent that Poo is a fixture in her community and has decided to stay despite her success. I enjoyed having the opportunity to see how locals live in Bangkok as this location is not somewhere I would have thought to visit during my stay. Poo and her staff explained why certain ingredients were used in the dishes and made sure to modify the dish for each participant dependant on their taste. We made Papaya Salad, Tom Yum with Prawns, Chicken Pad Thai and had fruits and mango with sticky rice for desert. I was surprised by how well the food turned out as we really did do the cooking on our own. They provided helpful recipe sheets for us to take home so we can recreate. Be sure to bring a bit of cash to purchase the famous cook book and some other knick knacks. I ended up getting a few books for friends back home.

Cooking with Poo involves a visit to the wet market of Klong Toey district and cooking with Poo and her assistants. The market is an adventure in itself; one of the cheapest and biggest markets in BKK, with a variety of foods (including live animals) that is breathtaking. Poo's assistants are ready to explain everything you see while buying ingredients that they will need later on, and that you will be cooking! You might want to get your own supply of spices, like fresh lemongrass or pad thai noodles. What followed is not only about cooking. Poo is above all a community worker, somebody who cares about the slum in which she lives and which she has not abandoned since her success story with cooking started some six to seven years ago. She has helped numerous families in her community earn a living and enjoy better lives than the majority in the slum. She has provided jobs and encouraged people to venture into own small enterprises that cater to tourists who take the cooling class. In addition, she is a skilled cook, the class is well organised and the food tasted excellent! If you like to cook yourself, do buy the cookbook that she wrote and indulge yourself in tastes of Thailand. Since I got home I cooked tom yum soup, using Poo's recipe, and found it particularly good. The final touch of adding some lime made the difference to previous recipes that I have used."

Most tourist attractions and tours I did there felt a bit rushed and seemed to only provide the bare minimum for your money, Poo goes above and beyond!Not only do you do cooking, but you have the trip to the market and lots of lovely stories from Poo and her staff which will keep you entertained.The food we cooked was absolutely delicious. It was the best green curry I had in Thailand! And the deserts and fruits were out of this world! We had a taster of many different exotic fruits that I had never even seen before. The only bad part of the day was I discovered that I love mangosteens and they just aren't available in the UK."

Picked up exactly on time and taken to the market where you behold some wonderful sights and smells. The market is really busy but Poo and her colleague lead you round without a problem explaining about various products on the way round. From geese, chickens, pork, seafood to herbs, spices and fruit and veg, the experience is eye opening. After this we ventured to the cookery school where Poo explained how it came about and how they give back to the community. We cooked beef salad, pad Thai, and green curry all of which we're delicious. If you're vegetarian don't worry they will provide veg or tofu alternatives. Dessert was mango with sticky rice and some weird and wonderful fruit picked up in the market. You have the opportunity to buy Poo's recipe book and other merchandise which all goes towards the charity helping hands. It was a fantastic experience and would recommend it to anyone. We had great fun and Poo and all her colleagues are really friendly. Not to be missed!"

I selected their class only based on their ranking at tripadvisor. My first impression before starting the class is their charge is comparatively high, as I originally planned to enroll another school who charged THB500 less than poo, but it's fully booked for my date unfortunately. Anyway, I am willing to pay for the THB500 extra with a high expectation. On the date of the class, we were asked to wait at the Emporium Suites for their car to pick us up to the market and the school. their team is easily recognized with cooking with poo Tshirt on. Their car is new, clean and edge, the inside is a bit similar to the one picking up Korean pop star.We spent around 1 hour in the market, as the staff spent sometime in buying the ingredients at the same time. I think the market would be those locals going to, as they have all kind of things selling.. In fact this is not special to me as Asian but it's amazing they also sell like ants, ants eggs, various of insects. We just walked around and you can ask any question to the staff, but one of their English is not fluent, and basically you don't expect them to teach you how to select an ingredient. We drove another 15-20mins from the market to the cooking school. And when I arrived I realized it is inside a slum in Bangkok. The school is small but with air con and the slum area is clean. This is eye catching to me. The date I learnt the classic Thai cuisine : padthai, tumyum soup and papaya salad. The ingredients were well prepared by their staff and all we have to do is cut it into small pieces and mix them up in the pot. I am so disappointed for such as I do expect some cooking skills as take out, not just eating the food. We spent time eating more than cooking there. I agreed with most of the average reviewers comments (I have read them all after the class), their comments are the most fair one. Before the class finished, they brought around 8-10 kinds of Thai fruits for us to try. It's good and should be amazing to those westerners. As an Asian, we know very well what are the fruits are. In general the experience is ok and I think poo is a truly smart and enthusiastic person that really want to improve the living standard of her village by their own ability. But the fee, to be honest for me, is a bit high. And this can only call an experience class not a cooking class. Agreed with those who have fair comments, if you truly want to learn cooking skills, pick another. If you want to experience Thai slum and willing to help them, this may not be a bad idea to join poo"

We started with a long tour of the food market, where one of Poo's staff showed us and explained all kinds of interesting foods, from insects to live fish and frogs, meats, fruits veggies, spices, and prepared food. She bought what we needed for the cooking class (none of the scary things), and the van took us to her teaching kitchen, located in the slum where she grew up. She told us about her project helping the residents of the slum work, and then we got cooking. The staff had prepped most of the ingredients, and we then did a bit of (easy) last-minute prep and the actual cooking. We cooked three dishes, eating each one after cooking. The standout was green curry with chicken, using freshly ground curry paste (pounding it with the mortar and pestle made the kitchen smell wonderful before it even hit the pan). Best green curry ever. At the end, she gave us a sampling of fresh Thai fruits and mango and sticky rice (also the best ever!). Poo is charming and warm, an excellent cook. After the class, we started noticing that her book was in stores all over Bangkok. Having tasted the food, we understood why."

Next we headed to Poo's kitchen where we were able to cook each individual dish for ourselves. This was greatly appreciated as you felt like you really did cook each dish yourself. The food was amazing!!! We chose the menu that included green papaya salad, tom yum soup, and phad thai. All were really great. Poo then had mango sticky rice for us for dessert (to die for!!) along with many fruits grown in Thailand available for us to try. Poo sent us home with the recipes for each dish we prepared which I also really appreciated. All along the way Poo and her staff were very friendly and willing to help us out, answer questions, etc. Overall I had a great time there, and left with a very full belly!! Loved it!"

Even if you are not \"into\" cooking, you will leave Poo's cooking school feeling great about being able to create some authentic Thai food (and eating it) and being able to contribute to the economy of this impoverished area. We (4 female friends) had a wonderful, fun time with Poo and her staff along with 6 other visitors. A perfect number for a morning of cooking good, tasty food. Very relaxing. The tour of the wet market before we went to the school was quite an experience and gave us an insight into how Thai people shop daily for food for their homes and restaurants. Would love to return to Bangkok and choose another menu to try."

The tour through the Khlong Toey wet market was very interesting and amazing to see all the different items. It's something that we probably wouldn't be able to fully do on our own, because it's huge and we'd get lost!Poo and her two assistants were great! There are five cooking stations set up in part of her home. The room has air conditioning, so it is comfortable.It was a lot of fun to make the dishes and delicious! This cooking class was perfect timing for us because we spent a couple of days in Bangkok and then we went to Phuket for a week at the Marriott Phuket Beach Club timeshare, which has a full kitchen. So we were able to cook the dishes, (Pad See Ewe, green curry, beef and cashew nuts, mango sticky rice, pumpkin custard) that Poo taught us or are in her cookbook! And we've made some of the dishes since we've been back home.It's great and really inspirational how Poo helps support her neighborhood and community with these cooking classes! Highly recommend signing up way in advance, as the classes get booked quickly.We'd probably take another class with Poo when we return to Bangkok!"

They pick you up from a few locations around town (we were coming from Sukhumvit) and shepherd you to the market for a walk through. The place is massive and it is interesting to see all the different variety of food compared to a north american grocery store. Then they take you from the market into the slums where Poo's cooking classroom is. You feel safe every second you are there and have absolutely nothing to worry about. The room is cute and although it is well made up and renovated it gives you the tiniest idea how small some of the slum houses can be. Poo helps guide you through the recipes fairly quickly (it's thai food there isn't that much fanciness about it) and you get to taste and enjoy all the dishes. There are some very handy cooking tips that I gained from the day - including that the more you cut a chili pepper up the hotter your dish will be that it's added into!"

The market is similar in many ways to my home town wet market except that we seldom see finger-long water buds with other insects which were recommended for deep fry... and also rainbow coloured cordial drinks in plastic bags ready for take away. Poo's kitchen was not fancy nor sofisticated, we could imagine the original state in the same slum area when she cooked for her family many years ago as a younger girl, just that without any air conditioning, nice flooring nor modern toilet facilities. Poo shared with us her story on how this all started, which added more meaning to the whole cooking experience. We were being told that by participating the cooking class, we actually were also helping the community in other ways, that we had joined in the helping hands. We had 12 ppl in the team, 6 cooking pans, we split into two teams in the cooking. So we got to taste our own cooking while watched other team mates coordinating with their new learnt skills, which somewhat entertaining... :)Food was good, ingredients were fresh, and the best thing was we didn't need to wash up the mess after each dish! I enjoyed the mango sticky rice dessert the most as it just tastes good and different from other mango sticky rice I tried, maybe it's the taste of home-made that made it special. I also can't forget the strong smell and taste of snake skin fruit among the fruit platter. 4 hours crushed course cooking with Poo opened my eyes and widened my stomach. I would highly recommend for anyone who wants to know more than just thai cooking."

Poo and her colleagues met us at a central hotel in Bangkok and took us to a local market to shop for food that we would use during the cooking class. What an amazing experience to be in the Khlong Toey market. It gave us a direct glimpse into how locals do their shopping in a market that is so unique from what we would see in a Western country. We then driven to the kitchen where the class was held. Poo has such a friendly, informal style of teaching the class and a great sense of humour. I felt like I was cooking with a bunch of friends. At first, I merely liked the idea that the proceeds helped the local community but the kitchen itself was located in the local community area and we got to see the direct impact of how the community was being helped. That made the experience all the more amazing."

She arrived late that October day at the meeting point (The Embassy Suites), but her warm, open, and friendly personality won everyone over (Bangkok traffic sucks anyway). We first visited the overwhelmingly large Khlong Toei market first, where Poo and her assistant Nuy explained the exotic and wonderful food items that could be found. When we arrived at the \"classroom,\" I found it to be quite clean (everyone removed their shoes). We also didn't have to do much prepping as each course was pretty much ready to go after an initial set up (veggies cleaned and meat chopped up appropriately, etc). Instructions were very easy to follow, resulting in delicious Thai dishes that we have been able to replicate back home (take-home recipes are provided). Although we didn't get to actually prepare it, the mango sticky rice dessert was the best I've ever had. If you're looking for something to do in Bangkok for a morning, check Poo's website.

I don't eat shellfish, and having advised Poo of this previously, an alternative meat was kindly provided. After all 3 dishes had been enjoyed, we were provided with 6-7 'unusual' fruits to try - this was really interesting and an added bonus!Finally, we enjoyed some sticky rice and mango, bought some a cook book and went happily on our way with full stomachs and smiles on our faces."

Your group, which only includes about 10 people at a time (book in advance) then go to the Klong Toei neighborhood to Poo's kitchen. The original kitchen was destroyed in a fire, but the staff had an alternate site up and running almost immediately--they are dedicated professionals. Along the way you walk through one of Bangkok's poorer districts, opening your eyes to a Bangkok not most get to see. Do say hello to the locals and children. Unlike \"slums\" in other metropolises, you will feel welcome and safe.The workshop is masterfully organized. You learn to whip-up a 3-course meal in a matter of two hours. The best part: you get to eat your creations. They prepare recipes for you to take home as well. The cooking will also introduce you to basic Thai cooking techniques and aromatics. You'll definitely want to show off your skills as soon as you get home.The best part though: Poo and her staff. They were amazing in every way: welcoming, informative, funny, and energetic. They were superb ambassadors of Thailand, its people, and its culinary traditions. The proceeds go to the local community and help support activities for disadvantaged children and women in the community.What a wonderful way to spend a day."

The cooking was fun and I was amazed on how simple, yet flavorful the dishes were to make. What made this experience most special was that Poo takes you to her home to do the cooking. Her school is not fancy by any means, but you can appreciate her story and how she got started because you are there in the heart of it. She welcomes you to her neighborhood and into the school that is attached to her home. It was a very personal, warm and authentic experience. I highly recommend it, gives you insight into the lifestyles of those in her neighborhood. I was sad to hear that Poo's home and cooking school along with many other homes was burned down since my class on August 2. I believe that she is already back and running in a new temporary location. This is a glimpse into the kind of work ethic she has. Her story is amazing, you have even more of a reason to support her cooking school now! Go for it!"

Great mix of:- seeing inside the slum (which this business is helping), - finding your way around Klong Toei market, - understanding what is at the market, why, and what to look for when chosing the best produce, - learning about Thai ingredients, and what you can use instead if you can't find it back home, - cooking & eating great food,all in one morning, without feeling rushed!Make sure you arrive hungry! and even then you might want to take one dish home (\u0e01\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19 'glab barn').Often fully booked well in advance - especially on popular days - so book as soon as possible.Really enjoyed it thanks."

This was one of the neatest things I have done in a foreign country--a nice contrast to visiting tourist sites, hanging out at the beach, shopping, etc. After trying for a long time to get into the class I finally succeeded. Only ten people are accepted at a time so you need to reserve far in advance. You start out by going to the rendezvous point--it is very close to the Skytrain stop and easy to find. You are picked up and taken to the gigantic Klong Toey food market to buy ingredients. That was an amazing experience with all kinds of weird and exotic things for sale including frogs, many varieties of seafood, marvelous tropical fruit and vegetables, flowers, etc. It was really informative to have somebody with you who understands it all and can explain why one type of lime is more expensive than others, which dragon fruit is ripe and who has the best rice pudding. After the market, you go to the cooking school. It is right in the middle of her neighborhood on a little alley. The \"classroom\" is small which explains why the courses are only for ten people. It was quite relaxing and easy to cook--everything is explained in simple terms and a lot of the ingredients are already pre-cut. It is like cooking with friends. The experience demystified the process of making Thai food--when you actually do it yourself it is really not that difficult, just a question of knowing which spices to use. As long as you are not totally inept, it will not be a problem. What you cook depends on the day of the class. Check the website for the meals on the day you will be there. All in all a very rewarding experience, from going to the market, preparing the food, eating it, visiting the neighborhood and chatting with the other \"chefs\". It had a real low key, friendly feel to it and cannot recommend it enough as something quite different from the regular tourist activities. On thing to note is that the apron used to cook is not to keep--you have to purchase it at the end if you want it."

The online booking is simple and easy to use, even allowing you to note any eating restrictions you may have. The staff coordinates with the students a central pickup/drop off location because the business/class is located within a \"slum\" of Bangkok and difficult to locate. The transportation van first takes the student to a local wet market for a guided tour of the market allowing students to experience the true feel of shopping in a Bangkok market. After the market, the van carries the students to Poo's business, where we enjoyed our cooking class. The class is limited to ten participants which is nice as five participants cook, then the other five cook. It's super easy and fun as Poo and her staff are super friendly and fun to work with. The food was fantastic also. We would highly recommend Cooking with Poo to anyone visiting or living in Bangkok. Part of the profits made from the cooking class also go toward helping those in the Poo's community with education and employment...just another reason to participate!"

            "review": "A great way to start a trip!. At just 1200 Baht (Around 20 Pounds) this is such great value for money. Essentially Poo is a local Thai who used to run a food stall not too dissimilar to the ones you see at the markets. She since began a small cooking class that has allowed her to cook with the likes of Jamie Oliver, and tour around the world. And it's easy to see why! Her food is amazing!First you meet Poo (She's named after a Thai variation of apple that sounds a lot like Cook Poo) by the Emporium Suites which are a little tricky to find with the directions, but it's close to the skytrain route so it was super easy - even for us rookie Farangs! The price of tickets includes everything, even Poo's airconned minibus that carts you all over town. Poo and her staff take you through the markets and explain all the different foods and fruits, how they taste, and how one might use them in cooking. Whilst the staff and Poo speak very good English, it was sometimes hard to understand at times but all very interesting. I loved that Poo buys the ingredients as she goes around the markets, being sure to funnel money from her success into the local markets of poorer families. The different foods and stalls are so interesting, and Poo has a story or two about most of them! One thing I would have liked is for the staff to encourage everyone to get to know each other first, because everyone stayed with the person they came with until near the end - so this might not be ideal for solo travellers. Poo introduces you to her friends, has loads of interesting stories, and even takes you to her home where you sometimes meet her family. She tells you how she first started out, and how she now makes enough to pay for a small kitchen next door which is wonderfully air conditioned! The staff are excellent, the cooking really fun and quick with three different dishes, and an awesome desert buffet. A few little touches I really loved were that Poo will wrap up your food to take home if you've already eaten. She offers merchandise at the end but makes it really clear that there is absolutely no pressure for you to buy anything. She gives you a little goody bag with the recipes you cooked to remind you when you get home. Her tour involves much needed water breaks where she buys everyone a drink. As well as buying all her ingredients from the local market, Poo pays 20% of your ticket to the Helping Hands foundation that helps give struggling Thai's a chance to work and earn money - this is done primarily through crafting souvenirs. Poo encourages you to look around the little house next door and look at some of the stuff they have made, again making it clear there is no pressure to buy. After everything, she drops you back to the emporium - it's so convenient and a great laugh - I would definitely recommend it! It was so useful knowing a bit about the fruits and foods before buying from the local markets!"

However, when we found our way to the Poo Kitchen we had a wonderful time and cooked some great dishes. We ate what we made and it was very tasty. The set up is very informal and relaxing. Poo herself and her staff are very charismatic and gives you an instant feeling of friendship. A % of the income goes to charity to help the poor which is a nice touch.

Not for the faint hearted but neither is it carnage. Educational explanations of all the bizarre and wonderful items follows. Produce collected we head back to the cooking school. The small groups mean that everyone has their fair share of time and attention. Cooking the dishes was great fun and relatively simple. Don't eat breakfast as you'll be eating what you cook! Once the four course are over, the last one is the amazing fruits from Thailand, you get the opportunity to buy some merchandise. No pressure at all but they make great gifts and you are supporting a great lady in her work with the poor. Poo's energy and enthusiasm is infectious.

We spent five weeks on holiday in Thailand and I can honestly say that this experience was one of, if not our most amazing high light of our whole vacation!We were emailed with confirmation of our booking and clear instructions for our pick up at a central mall location in Bangkok. We were picked up by Poo and her friendly staff and first taken to the Klong Toey Market, where Poo and her staff gave us guided tour. The market was vibrant, selling all manner of fresh and exotic produce from bugs, frogs, eels and crabs, to mango, coconut and all the freshest tropical fruit and vegetables. Our six year old son loved every minute! Poo's English was great and she loved our kids and even bought our daughter candy-floss (cotton candy) at the market as a special treat.After the tour of the market where Poo showed us where she buys all her produce, we were driven to the Klong Toey Slum and taken to her cook school located in the slum. Her cook school kitchen is large and accommodating. It is clean, air-conditioned and completely hygienic with a western bathroom. We then spent the rest of the morning learning how to cook and then eat three different delicious Thai dishes. Poo was more than happy to have our kids there and even let them assist us as we prepared our dishes. The instructions were easy, Poos staff were fabulous and we could adjust the amount chillies/heat to our taste and so even our 4 year old daughter loved each dish!!! Poo even treated us to mango sticky rice and various tropical fruit that were all new to us.Poo explained that her cooking school is part of the Helping Hands foundation that also supports the employment and empowerment of other Klong Toey Slum residents. Absolutely inspirational!Can't recommend Cooking with Poo enough. Thanks Poo and team!!!"

When my friend asked if I wanted to go I jumped at the chance because this is different to the myriad of cooking schools I have previously done.The market tour was far more interesting than normal, mainly because it wasn't a tick and flick exercise. On this tour you really got to spend time walking through the market and seeing more than just the ingredients needed for the recipes you were going to prepare.The experience of walking through the slums was a real eye opener.While I appreciated the air conditioned kitchen to some extent I think I would have preferred the previous kitchen for a more authentic experience.The cooking itself was very basic but it didn't clean to be anything else.For those that have been to other cooking schools the cooking experience may be a little disappointing.Having said that you do get some hints and tips that I have not previously received.The food was nice and from previous experience will be easy to replicate at home. The Pad Thai was disappointing but I think that is because on of the staff assumed I didn't want up use fish sauce and instead put soy sauce in my dish. I could really taste the soy and I think it spoilt the dish.On the day my friend was unable to join me as her son was quite unwell. We knew there were no refunds but given you can take home any food you don't eat it would have been nice if they asked if I wanted to cook her share to take it home for her. Then again I probably should have asked that question.If you have not previously been to a Thai cooking class I would definitely recommend this class because of the overall experience. If you have been to Thai cooking classes go if you want a different cooking experience but don't expect advanced cooking.Oh and don't park a car at the Emporium Suites, the parking is very expensive particularly by Bangkok standards."

If you are going to do a cooking course then you must choose this, if not for the charity benefits, do it to meet Poo! She is a wonderful woman and very knowledgeable about Thai food and the culture. The team picked us up exactly on time and looked after us right up until they dropped us off near our home again around 2pm. The dishes that we made were all delicious and she was very generous about everyone having as much fruit and mango sticky rice as we wanted at the end. We could take home anything we didn't eat and we all had a good go at cooking each dish. We made lemongrass salad, pad thai and massaman curry. She did not pressure us into buying any of her souvenirs and products but we all wanted to by the end. She told us funny anecdotes and stories the whole day and gave us a great tour of a proper Thai market (not for the faint hearted though!) This is for a good cause and at only 1200 THB you can't go wrong. The only thing that makes me sad is that too many Westerners will change the market and the area where she lives. For the time being, the money invested by farang's has helped a lot of people in Klong Toey especially anyone linked with Poo."

Firstly, it's great for those who wish to gain more insight into Thai food and all the intricacies like markets and such like. Also, it's great for the area. Cooking With Poo promotes the Klong Toey area of BKK, one of the biggest slums in Asia. The fact that Poo (short for Chumpoo, meaning Rose in Thai) still houses her programme here draws great attention and economy to the area. fIf you wish, you can donate your meal to the unfortunate souls of Klong Toey, but there's no expectation. The book and apron (' I cooked with Poo and I liked it') are great investments and something my girlfriend and I, who live in BKK, use regularly for our meals."

Teaching every single class herself, 6 days a week (sometimes even 7) Khun Poo offers her authentic knowledge of the Thai cuisine and its roots with candidness, sensibility and playfulness. It is understandable how her passion for cooking and for helping people have made such a huge impact to her community in Klong Toey. The visit began with the van getting us at the pick up location and two of her cooking staff took us to the Klong Toey market where we learned about the local produce, much of which we used and taste afterwards in the cooking class located in her small cooking school in the slum.It's such an affordable class and you are able to experience real people that aren't trying to rip off tourist but wanting to share their love for their traditional foods and proudly show them a piece of their community. MUST.NOT.MISS.THIS. Everyone was delightful, the cooking was such a fun experience in itself and it's a great plan to do with your friends, partner, older children (11 and up), or a parent. No cooking skills required!!! You will learn this easy and delightful dishes in no time."

This class is a hands-on cooking experience that educates you not only about the Thai ingredients and cooking methods but also how economic adversity in the slums of Bangkok can be turned around by a community of dedicated people. We made the most delicious chicken green curry using the fresh ingredients that we picked out in the market at the start of the morning. We made our curry from scratch using our muscles with a mortar and pestle. The mango sticky rice was heavenly. The market tour is a bit overwhelming at the beginning with the live toads, snakes, eels and bugs but it soon gets amazing with the displays of fresh fruits and veggies. I would recommend sturdy shoes as the floors are wet and slippery. There is air con in the van and the cooking school so you will be comfortable unless you mistakenly eat a chili pepper instead of the tomato. Poo and her crew are warm, friendly and engaging. Poo is going on a UK tour soon with Jamie Oliver so you can see her outside of Thailand. I have gone to several cooking classes around the world and this is right up there with the best.

It was a great experience, and when we visit Bangkok again it will be on our list to do again, as you have a choice of what you learn to cook depending on the menu for each day of the week. The walk through the wet market - which is vast - was an eye-opener, and the produce was well explained by one of Poo's staff who walked with us. The class held in the Klong Toey slum area was well organised and so enjoyable - you cook, then eat what you've cooked or you can take it home with you. There is a selection of fruits for you to try afterwards as well, and time for photos too! Poo is lovely and has a wonderful personality, besides being a brilliant cook. Everything is very well organised, from being picked up in a mini-bus and returned afterwards. We bought the Poo's cookery book - there is no pressure to buy, but I would recommend a copy. You can also buy a few lovely handicrafts at a nearby house, which is helping the local community, but again no pressure to buy. Poo is coming to the UK soon, so if you have chance it would be worth trying to see her.Thank you to our daughter for organising this wonderful surprise Christmas present - and thank you, Poo, for one of the highlights of our visit to Bangkok!"

We got to learn the local market goods and bought some fruit (mangosteens are delicious fruit, we regret not buying a bunch to eat later) and even stopped by a thai whiskey bar stand for shots. We then headed over to the cooking class, with 8 people total. We each got to cook all the meals and so simple it was. We made delicious papaya salad, tom yum soup, and pad thai. My pad thai was better than what i would get at the street food stalls! Poo also had mango and sticky rice ready for us for dessert and a variety of fresh fruit samples for us to try from the market. She did a great job explaining thai cooking techniques and provided copies of the recipes, however, we just bought her cookbook as there are more thai dishes we want to try out.

There were two guides taking us around the market buying the ingredients for our lunch and explaining anything and everything along the way. Seeing some of the 'live' produce was a bit confronting but it really gave us an insight into the real Thai way of life. Once we finally go to Poo's kitchen the hands-on cooking was simple and very satisfying. Seeing Poo's neighbours and hearing how the money gets used to help her community was made me glad our small contribution would help so many people. Definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Bangkok."

This was a really excellent thing to do - a very easy booking, simple reconfirmation, the pick up point was very easy to get to using sky train, and the mini bus used to take us to the market and cooking school was in great condition with a very safe driver.Our total group was quite large and we broke into a group of 6 and 5 in the market which made it easier to navigate through as well as to stay with our guide who told us what everything was and what dishes it could be used in. We were in the market for about an hour and then went to Poo's neighbourhood which was about 10-15 minutes away in the mini van. Our guide showed us the house where Poo first lived with her family, and where she started to cook, the next place she moved too (over the path) and then the kitchen and house where she now lives and works (next door to her first house!) The kitchen is simple but spacious and spotlessly clean. Poo welcomed us and explained how she started the business and the other community businesses supported by Helping Hands.Then we started cooking: we made 3 dishes including the one we wanted to learn the most, Green Curry. We couldn't believe how fast and easy everything was, Poo's style is to take out the complication and make it fun and easy. Perfect! We definitely hope to try the dishes again when we get home.If you have the chance to cook with Poo, do it. She is a wonderful inspirational woman, and she is very committed to making a positive impact on her community. Other tips:Don't eat breakfast before you go, you will have 3 decent size portions of food plus a dessert + fruit. You won't need lunch afterwards either! Book early as the class fills up fast (check the web site as they have specific menu's for each day)"

The class itself is a very basic level which is understandable because of the short time available. It however gives a good idea of just how quick and easy it is to prepare delicious, authentic Thai food. If you are looking for in-depth practice, this is not the place. Or maybe Thai food doesn't require a lot of technique. Everything we made was delicious. I appreciated the dessert of exotic fruit. It enabled me to try things I had seen in markets (and some I hadn't) that I hadn't dared buy. They even had a western style birthday cake for a client whose birthday it was.

They helped us substitute ingredients (my BF doesn\u2019t eat meat and I cannot do very spicy dishes). You each make your own dish and eat while the other half of the group makes theirs. Having only 8 people makes for a very intimate and fun learning experience. I purchases her cook book and cannot wait to make the dishes here in the U.S. Poo is very friendly, easy to talk to, energetic and ready for anything!"

The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 rating is that I couldn't understand one of the women at all. She led my group through the market and pointed at things but I had no idea what she was saying and I'm an ELL teacher. She also taught the first round of cooking and I had to ask for someone else because I simply couldn't understand. Maybe some of the funds from this wonderful project could help the presenters work to improve their English/ accent."

I have always been a fan of the authentic Thai cuisine that one can find on stalls and in alleys scattered all around Bangkok. I always wanted to learn how to make some of these flavoursome, delicious dishes. Well now I can.Poo and her staff escort you around the Klong Toei market explaining the amazing sights and sounds (and smells) of a genuine local market, this is no sanitized tourist trap but a real working bustling market that feeds many thousands of people each day. The fruits and vegetables, seafood and herbs are fresh and bursting with flavour. I had never seen Galangal (one of the standard ingredients in Thai cooking) so fresh as I did at Klong Toei market. The guides are well informed and happy to help you delve into the experience and to identify the countless items that the Western eye is unaccustomed to seeing, from frogs to edible insects to the almost infinite variety of herbs and spices.After the market you are taken to Poo's basic but clean kitchen deep in the Klong Toei slum where the best cookery class that I have ever attended is provided. Poo delivers the class with an easy charm and gets to the heart of the balanced flavours of Thai cuisine. She helps grow understanding of the subtleties and techniques required to make multiple signature dishes in the one whirlwind lesson.This attraction was so good that I did it twice. I highly recommend Cooking with Poo to anyone who has an interest in Thai cooking and has a day to invest in Bangkok."

Many were outrageously expensive and held in huge international hotels so felt like it would be similar to doing it back home. We are so glad we booked with Poo and her team. The experience started with being taken to the food market, as other reviewers have said that in itself is an experience. From the jumping bags of frogs, slithering eels and insects it made us very happy when we stopped to buy chicken for the class. It was great to see the many fresh ingredients used and have them explained to us. We then headed back to the klong to start the class. Our group was quite small and everyone got to cook and eat their own dishes. All the dishes we cooked were quick and easy to do at home. We bought Poo's book and have since had several feasts with friends and family. This is a morning tour that you should definitely book. It is a fabulous experience and it is great to know that by doing this tour your are helping the community in the klong."

Cooking with Poo was an amazing experience and I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to see how the Thai's operate the largest fresh food distribution operation in Bangkok and of course the fabulous food we cooked was an added bonus! The booking process was smooth and the website is super easy to negotiate through. You will get a confirmation email immediately and a day before our class we got a courtesy reminder email. Unfortunately traffic was hideous that morning and the lovely lady who led the tour eventually got there about 25 minutes late. We ended up walking to the market as the minivan could not get to the hotel in time. The walk was pleasant enough and we got to see Rama iv up close and personal. On the way the mini van swung right past us and picked us up so we got to the markets in style. Ok if you are not used to big, smelly, live animal markets then you might need to brace yourself and for your sanity, wear closed in shoes as they recommend. The market floor is slippery and wet, wet, wet with chicken fat and fish waste so watch your feet. The smell especially near the live chickens and ducks and the fish and pigs was not for the faint hearted. I found it simply amazing and was blown away with the freshness and quality of the products on offer. The tour operator was wonderful and showed us some incredible sights. She's a local and was super knowledgeable about the market. You can buy whatever you like at the market for yourself so don't forget your bhat so you can pick up some mangosteen or fresh lychees for yourself. Bring your camera, words cannot describe this market and the people who live and breathe this lifestyle. As I said its not for the faint of heart but its totally totally worth it. We got dropped to the edge of the Klong Toey slum where Poo has lived all her life. She now operates a cooking school there and started from such humble beginnings it really puts things in perspective. Poo is a superstar, she has charisma in bucketloads and her English is excellent. We cooked delicious meals, we were so full I could barely eat the sticky mango rice at the end, that was a first for me!! For me, personally, it was not about the food or cooking class, it was seeing how the real life people of the slum live and work, it was such a contrast to the glamour of the rooftop bars, five star hotels, brand polluted shopping centres and decadent massage parlours us Westerners think is Bangkok. To see how Poo has helped herself and others to make a better life for themselves has impacted me forever. I will never forget how I cooked with Poo and I loved it!"

People from the area assist in running the classes so there is about 1 teacher per 4-5 students - this makes it really easy to get a bit of a hand. The trip through the market at the start is also a bit of an eye opener unless you are a seasoned Asian market-goer. Baskets of frogs, big fish jumping out of the buckets, lots of very unusual ingredients and produce, not to mention the stinking klong behind the stalls make this an experience. Poo also takes you to a little local handicrafts store nearby; items are made locally and are mostly inexpensive. It wasn't a pushy tourist experience so that was fine; we both bought a couple of small items."

Her tour through the market is fantastic and you see a side of Bangkok that you will not otherwise see. Poo brings a positive energy and gives you a local feel that you will otherwise miss in a fantastic city like Bangkok. The cooking is basic but fun and all are involved. Great tour. I would strongly recommend for just about anyone but certainly for families with older kids - pre-teen/teens."

Then you'll try your hands at cooking a very simple but delicious meal. If interested, you can also get Poo's famous cookbook and some local handicrafts (which are surprisingly good). The more adventurous of you can also try fried grasshoppers and other local delicacies.I must say, I have little experience with cooking (and almost none when I joined the class), but even now I still make occasional Tom Yum or Pad Thai and the result turns out pretty good.

The class was simple and easy to follow, the group was friendly, and the local setting was great to be immersed in. It would be very easy to go to Bangkok and only visit the glitzy shopping centres and tourist spots, so I recommend this class as a way to see the other side of the city and learn about traditional cooking at the same time. Poo and all her team are lovely, happy, friendly people, and it is nice to know how much the local community benefits from their efforts. Basically it's a no-brainer - just sign up to cook with Poo, and you won't be disappointed!"

Wanting to do a cooking course that wasn't affiliated with a major hotel (and with the attached price tag), I read reviews about Poo's cooking school and decided to give it a go. From memory it was about $40AUD per person which was great value considering the food you get to eat, the experience and what you learn. There are a few set menu options that you preselect at the time of booking.They picked you up from a major hotel with a group of approx 10 other people and took you to the Khlong Toei food market to pick up your ingredients for your meal. This blew us away! There were live fish jumping out of their baskets onto the footpath in front of us, live frogs, skinned frogs, raw meat, fresh fruit, premade curry pastes...it was an assault on our senses in a good way and made shopping at Coles back at home seem sooo boring! You stop at a few stalls and your guide tells you about the different ingredients, what they are used for etc. It was really great having a local show us this market that we otherwise would never have gone to! There also aren't any Westerners here, so you feel like a local, although the stares from everyone else remind you that you're not! You then get taken back to the cooking school which is really one of the houses in the Khlong Toei community. It is a little small, but it is enough for your group of 10. You are provided with cold water on your arrival which is much needed after the heat of the market. Poo is such a lovely lady and when you hear her story, it is so great that she is trying to make a difference and make a future for herself and her community. Each couple is provided with a mini gas burner and each person gets the chance to make their own meal after you watch Poo how to make it. It is really professionally run....all your ingredients are brought out to you to prepare and there is always someone there to watch over you and guide you. There is always plenty of food to eat and it is really a rewarding experience! You finish by having the ability to buy some goods from Poo such as a cook book or apron (`I cooked with Poo and I liked it!), both of which we bought because we really liked them plus we were glad it was helping someone out. There is also a giftware shop next door where some locals make necklaces, really unique gift cards etc which are really cheap and make nice gifts for those at home.If I haven't sold this to you enough....just do it!"

Each person got to make his or her own dish. To my great surprise, my 10 year old son was ecstatic about this and cooked his own food...and even ate it! If you book all 10 slots, you can choose your own menu. The unique fruit and also sticky rice and mango as the finale was awesome. The price is well worth what you get...plus you're contributing to the community. I even bought shirts for the kids for Christmas, apron, and cookbook (which I use often).

If you want to get out of the shopping mall maze in Bangkok and take in a different side of life in the city, let Poo and her dedicated tour guides pick you up and take you through their own neighborhood. I did it twice in 2012. Once with my mom and once with my two girlfriends who were also 24.They'll walk your though the busiest market in all of Bangkok, Klong Toei. It's the absolute lifeblood of the city. Everything is fresh off the boat from early that morning. We picked up ingredients for our meal and learned about some of the strange ingredients that are household essentials for the Thai people. You can pick the brains of the young tour guides about their own lives, or ask them to translate for you while to ask about vendors about how to eat the exotic fruits you are buying. Poo then piles everyone back in the van and her husband drives us to their neighborhood where their kitchen is. This neighborhood is a giant beautiful slum. Bright bits of laundry flap in the breeze above our heads as we move down a narrow walkway to her modest, intimate kitchen. Inside, the gang has burners and cutting boards ready to go for us. There, we cook and eat, cook and eat, through three courses. The green curry and pad thai are as fantastic and the mango and sticky rice for dessert. It's all storytelling, cooking and chowing down. Poo will tell you about how the neighborhood has changed and what role her cooking school has played in the community. It's inspiring, to say the least."

The trip through the markets was just great with some fantastic photo opportunities and expert commentary. However the cooking was the best part, being expertly instructed by Khun Poo.

Dogs lay under the meat counters, the vendors were all business and barely took notice of us, and we muddled through following our enthusiastic guides.

I've owned Murni's Warung, a restaurant in Ubud, Bali, for 40 years - in fact it's our anniversary next month - and I've been to many cooking classes in Thailand and around the World. Let me tell you that this is one of the best, not just for the quality of the recipes, but also for the warmth and expertise of Khun Poo and her staff, and for the interest. Klong Toei is a wonderful market, where you will start the class by going on a tour of it, and the slum where Khun Poo teaches is extremely interesting to see and a place that you probably would not otherwise see. The arrangements all worked like clockwork.Jonathan was so impressed that he wrote about Khun Poo in his ebook The Bangkok Story and hopefully it will help Khun Poo in her career. Both of us recommend Khun Poo's cooking class and as soon as we are back in Bangkok in a couple of months we will go again - and again - and again.Murni"

From the beginning, we were met by Khun Poo and her helper and had a chance to chat with the other attendees as we drove to the market. The market was such a cool experience. It had some of everything, and lots of things I had never seen before. After the market, we headed back to Poo's neighborhood to begin cooking. The cooking setup was fantastic. Very basic, clean, and with everything we needed. The food we created was delicious and I love how we go tot take the recipes home with us. Don't miss one of Poo's cooking classes when you visit Bangkok. Book well in advance and have a great time!"

Poo was a very humorous chef. The morning started with a tour of a local market. My god-daughter was very intrigued, clicking her camera away, to see all the strange creatures from tad pols to roasted silk worms. Khun Poo painstakingly explained each section of fresh food as to the origin and how people eat them. Then we went to her one-room kitchen in one end of the community, and began our 2-hour cooking class. She gave us the menus and even food choices that morning. Along the way, we tasted as we finished each dish. Everyone had a chance to try our hands on the wok and stir-fry. People were delighted at how the spices and sauces and ingredients worked perfectly together to produce the dishes they ate. My god-daughter thought it was the best adventure in town! We had a great time and would recommend this to anyone coming into Bangkok."

It has been more than a year since we experienced the local Thai market and the wonderful experience of Poo's cooking class, but the memory seems to stand out more and more among numerous activities in the month we spent in Thailand. The market was incredibly memorable as seeing all the varieties of fish, frogs, eels, and other critters came a bit unexpectedly. We then picked up fresh ingredients to return to the kitchen and cook with. All the dishes were simple, made easily, and have been able to be re-created now that we are home. The people couldn't be friendlier. We also love the setting - a home in a poorer community where Poo helps her neighbors - as opposed to a generic kitchen in a high-end restaurant. Definitely a good value. p.s. Don't underestimate the fun of saying \"We cooked with Poo in Thailand\" when at dinner parties. That alone would make this worth a few extra bucks."

My husband and I were looking for something different to do during our two day stopover in Bangkok and we decided to do this due to all of the glowing tripadvisor reviews - and we were glad to did. The markets were quite an experience and some of the smells were a bit rough on the nose (especially first thing in the morning) but it was a great opportunity to see the 'true' Bangkok. To be honest we were expecting the slums (where the cooking course takes place) to be more confronting than what they were. There were hardly any residents around (as they were all at work) and it looked quite tidy and relatively clean. Poo's place itself is really nice.The dishes we cooked were remarkably simple and quick, especially considering how delicious they were. We also brought the cookbook and can't wait to try out these recipes at home (especially the massaman curry from scratch!). The mango sticky rice we had as dessert was just divine - I'm a convert now and was eating it every chance I got during our time in Asia. And of course the best thing of all was that this is all for a good cause! I hope this doesn't lose it's authenticity as it grows in popularity."

The class size is excellent, and Poo had an additional guide with us at the market so we could travel in smaller groups (5 to a group) and hear all the information about the market. Luckily, Poo had the foresight to put a little warning card in the van on the way to the market advising us that some of the sights might be disconcerting to those unaccustomed to shopping anywhere but the supermarket. Walking through the market was a bit of a culture shock; live animals, dead animals, pungent smells, and more. Be sure to wear closed toed shoes! The market, once you get over the initial shock of it, is very interesting and has every possible food item available. The class itself was excellent. I have taken classes in the the US at Sur La Table, and this class was comparable, if not better. Each person makes their own meal, so you can make it as spicy/sweet/salty as you want. I went with a friend, and the rotating cooking turns worked out great so we could take pictures, eat our food, etc. while the other was cooking.Poo was very friendly, very talkative, and, contrary to some of the reviews I have read, had an excellent grasp of English and was easy to understand. All of her assistants were helpful as well. It was especially interesting to hear her story about how she developed her cooking school, and how she has remained in the slum to help give back to the area. Dont eat breakfast that morning though, because you make a ton of food and will want to eat all of it! After the meal there is dessert and assorted fruits as well. Make sure to bring some Baht with you too, as there are fun souvenirs and cookbooks available at the end of class."

If you want to get into the real local community and learn how to make a few key Thai dishes while contributing to the local community, then this tour is for you. Poo is very well known and she has retained her wonderful charm and fun personality. Her team of helpers are fabulous. We highly recommend cooking with Poo for travellers seeking an adventure from their cooking school.

It was the only part of our Thailand experience we booked ahead and it was our treat for the final day of the holiday. An excellent choice. The pick up was easy to find and went smoothly. The market was incredible - not for the faint hearted. It's a real live food market and some of the sights were a bit different to the British, Australian and Dutch markets we were used to. The staff led us round explaining all the different ingredients, so knowledgable and passionate about food and cooking. The school in the slum is really well prepared. The team work so well together, you arrive and all ingredients are ready and you cook three amazing dishes. Poo was great. She talked very lovingly about the slum and about the people and the positive impact the school and helping hands had. She talked us through the recipes and answered all our questions. She was very warm and funny. We had a great time, picked up a couple of new techniques got the free recipes to try back home and bought a few souvenirs. It was great fun, with the market and the slum location, it was also a very unique experience of Bangkok, a perfect way to finish our holiday and great to be putting money into such a great project. Well done Poo and your team."

We have just returned from our cooking class this morning feeling humble and inspired, and not just for Thai cooking.We started out at the markets being shown ingredients for all sorts of dishes. The markets were eye opening, things eaten every day in Bangkok we wouldn't see in a lifetime in Australia, many still swimming, wriggling, clucking or any number of other things. Some may find it a little confronting, but I found it fascinating. The Helping Hands team were extremely friendly and helpful it was wonderful seeing the way the cooking class has made a connection with the businesses in the markets.We went to the Helping Hands class for our honeymoon and Khun Poo taught us 3 dishes and then gave us a desert of mango and sticky rice. I won't go into the detail of the dishes, but it was amazing the flavours that can be produced relatively easily with some basic ingredients. Khun Poo and her team made me realise how easy it is to cook with fresh ingredients.What Helping Hands is doing for the local community is really amazing. The success of the cooking class has a flow on effect into other local businesses and it is quite inspiring.That aside, the cooking class was great, finding the pick-up point was easy via the BTS and the ride to the markets and then the cooking class was very comfortable.I thoroughly recommend this class for the learning and the overall experience.We cooked with Poo and we liked it!"

We started by exploring the wet market - wear covered shoes if possible and take your camera. We have been living in Bangkok for almost a year but there were still so many fruits and vegetables in the markets that we hadn't tried and wouldn't have known what to do with if we had! The market trip was fascinating and will inspire us to be a bit more adventurous in our food shopping now. (Might still give the insects a miss though.) We had a great time learning to cook Thai dishes and were very impressed with our own cooking! Our teenagers loved it - though if you have wimpy kids like ours, ask for a little less spice in their Green Curry. Two of our children have a nut allergy and Poo adapted the menu for them and was very sensitive to their needs. Afterwards, we walked a little way along the soi to look at handicrafts made locally. An opportunity to pick up presents/souvenirs and support the people living in the Klong Toey slums. A great experience all round and a chance to see more of the real Bangkok."

The meeting place at the Emporium was easy to find and it was great to see that a coffee shop was available upstairs while we waited since we had not had a chance for breakfast this morning. I especially liked that we could eat our dishes as we cooked them. I also enjoyed tasting the various fruits since I was too intimidated to try them on my own at the street markets. I am excited to try some of the recipes from the cookbook which was reasonable priced. The kitchen and bathroom were kept very clean and the space was very comfortable with plenty of cooking/sitting/eating room for all 10 of us. Khun Poo is such a passionate person and it was our pleasure to have met her. This is a definite must-do for couples, friends, and families with older children (at least 10+) while visiting Bangkok for anyone who loves cooking or even just eating."

The session runs at a house in one of the small lanes in Klong Toey. From the booking until the end of the lesson, everything was organised well. Booking and payment was done online. The instructions and tips provided on the email on how to get to the meeting point and what to wear were useful.The class started with the journey to the traditional market at Klong Toey, it was a great experience, particularly with the first part, visiting the Issan people market which sells a lot of things which are not our usual staple ;-) Khun Poo and her assistant Noi brought few samples for us to try later on. For my session, we learnt Thai Lemongrass salad, Stuffed Omelette and Massaman Curry. As many have said, the instructions given by Khun Poo and Noi was quite clear despite language. It is easy to understand their English. Every dish that we learnt to make was for us to taste and eat ;-) For those who will be taking this lesson, mind you, come with empty stomach as there are plenty to eat. The whole experience was fun and enjoyable. Khun Poo also shared with us the story on how the cooking school started, how this school has benefitted many others and transformed their lives in Klong Toey (the infamous slum area). I highly recommend for those who want to learn how to cook Thai food to start with this class. Khun Poo and her team do make it easy ;-)Another tip is to book this class in advance (few weeks or a month prior). As I left it until I reached Thailand, we could only book one person in our group to go for the lesson and I was the fortunate one to go."

He planned the Helping Hands: Coooking with Poo experience, I am not much of a cook and didn't know what to expect. Poo's husband picked us up from the Emporium Suites with 2 of her staff, we drove to the Klong Toey fresh markets which was such an amazing unforgettable experience. All of the live animals, beautiful fruits, cooking implements and so much more, one of the staff explained all of the different produce - what it was used for, the Thai and English names, she was very informative, she assisted fellow tourists with purchases from the stalls. We then continued our journey to the slums, where Poo and her family lives. I was unsure what to expect and it was an eye opening experience walking along the narrow paths to the cooking school, all of the local people and children were very friendly. The cooking lesson was great for me as a beginner Poo and her staff answered any questions I had. My husband an avid cook was also impressed by Poo and her knowledge of the cuisine. We were inspired by her story and achievements, we hope to here more from her in the future and are sure she will do more great things. We cooked three dishes stir fry noodles with black bean sauce, Thai green curry (which we helped make the curry paste), and beef with cashew nuts all of which were delicious. She gave us the recipes to make again at home, we finished off the cooking experience with mango sticky rice and fruit tasting a great opportunity to try new fruits I wouldn't have considered trying myself. We purchased 3 copies of her cookbook to give to family in Australia. A definate highlight of our trip to Bangkok, we would recommend to all visiting"

The instructions to the meeting point were clear and the place easy to get to. It was great to have been shown around the Klong Toey wet market - I loved Poo's animated commentary - but it's not for very sensitive people, I guess, and it pays to wear something else than flip flops or sandals. What a range of food - animal, vegetable, mineral, dead, alive, wet, dry - and anything in between! A cooking class without a visit to the market would be only half the fun.The kitchen in Klong Toey 'slum' is simple but tidy. The menu is pretty basic, which suited us because we had no real experience with cooking Thai food. If you want to explore the finer points of Thai cuisine then perhaps another school or a longer class may be more suitable. Nevertheless, the food was delicious and there was plenty of it.The only comment I would make is that it would be nice to have some suggestions how to substitute some of the ingredients, both at the class and in the cook book, which we'll probably struggle to find in the smaller town we shop in.The best thing about this place is the story behind it, of course. Poo comes across as very genuine and truly committed to her cause. The whole team are really hard workers and can be an inspiration to anybody to raise above their own 'glass ceilings'.I'm looking forward to visiting the cafe they are about to open near the market to give young people opportunities to learn employment skills."

A little bit about the class: \u201cCooking with Poo\u201d classes take place six days a week and, cost between $30 and $40 depending on the season, and last approximately four hours, from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. They include roundtrip transportation from the Emporium Suites hotel in Bankok to Klong Toey slum (one of the city\u2019s largest slums, located about 20 minutes away), a local wet market tour, hands-on instruction and consumption of three entrees, written recipes in English, and a delicious Thai dessert/fruit tasting. Highlights:* Tour of Klong Toey Fresh Market is unforgettable \u2013 it is HUGE and between the live animals, beautiful tropical fruit, and all of the market activity, it\u2019s a feast for your eyes! * Classes are 100% hands-on, and after each course, students enjoy their dish = immediate satisfaction :)* Students experience another area of Bangkok that they might not otherwise explore and Poo\u2019s story of hardship and entrepreneurship are truly inspiring Words of Advice:* It's very hot in Bangkok and since the kitchen where you're preparing dishes is rather cozy, it gets hot! So be prepared to sweat. * Be patient with tour guides and with Poo - they tend to speak quickly so if you need something repeated, speak up!* Take extra cash just in case you want to purchase one of Poo's cookbooks, an apron, or some of the handmade crafts sold next door as part of Helping Hands (a fair-trade initiative that supports micro-businesses within the slum)"

After the tour the journey took us to Klong Toei slum, where poo lives, and where the kitchen is based for her cooking school. My idea of a slum is shanty towns but the area wasn't what I had in mind. OK, the people were clearly poorer than other areas of Bangkok and the closeness of the houses was a real eye-opener. The people we met along the way were all so friendly.The cooking part of the day was not what you would call a 'lesson'. Poo was simply showing how to make and blend certain ingredients in order to create important Thai cuisine. All of the food of course was delicious and by the end of the fruit tasting and sticky rice with mango, I was stuffed!I bought one of the books from Poo and some of the girls bought some hand-made jewelry in the neighboring shop, which is also run by Poo. What she has done to help the area (she has so many stories) is incredible and she is clearly proud of what she has achieved for herself and the residents of the slum.

It was a priviledge to share Poo's vision of making a difference through her cookery classes and the other small businesses that she has built with people from the largest slum area in Bangkok. The visit to the wet market was insightful, the cooking well organised, the recipes delicious and realistic. But most infectious was the warmth and passion of Poo's class. I went to learn to cook Thai food and came away with so much more, I have never written a review on trip advisor before but just wanted to add my praise to that of many others, you are an angel Poo!"

            "review": "Helping Hands and Chef LeeZ Comparison. I attended two cooking classes in Bangkok (Helping Hands with Poo, and Chef LeeZ) and so will write a single review that discusses both. I will then rate each class separately under their respective headings. I found Helping Hands particularly insightful because of the location, the (so-called) Klong Toey slum, and also because it combined a visit to Bangkok's largest wet market to purchase fresh ingredients for the class. Many, myself included, are sure to find elements of the market disturbing. There will be areas you'll need to hurry through if you don't want to see live animals, including turtles and frogs, slaughtered. That said it is possible to avoid the more grisly sights, and the market is unquestionably a hyper-sensory experience; a vast array of colors, smells and just about every ingredient imagineable is available there somewhere. And the idea of the slum location shouldn't be off-putting; it was fascinating to walk along the narrow pathways, and to see first-hand how the majority of Bangkok's citizens live on a daily basis. The area was both safe and clean, and the class room on a par with Chef LeeZ's. In terms of the class itself, I would say Chef Lee might have been a slightly more thorough teacher than Poo. Her instruction was more detailed, and various aspects of the preparation and cooking process explained in greater depth. If you are in Bangkok long enough, or have the time and resources to attend more than one class, I recommend both. If your interest is soley on learning how to prepare classic thai dishes, Chef LeeZ may be the better option. If you want to combine an educational experience with basic thai cooking instruction, Helping Hands and Poo might hold more interest. The story, and history of Helping Hands is also gratifying, and something that Poo shares during the course of the class. I should also point out that Chef LeeZ also features a brief visit to a small local market. The recommended instructions for getting to Chef Lee are by boat, so if you don't have a separate river excursion planned, this also adds to the experience. The boat isn't necessary however, and we actually took a taxi back to our Ratchaprasong area hotel (much quicker than the boat option). I thoroughly enjoyed, and highly recommend both classes."

If you\u2019re of a nervous disposition it might not be your thing, but hey, even if your staying at a 5-star hotel likelihood is the ingredients for your supper came from here.As we were in a group of 4 it was easy to ask questions and find out all about the produce, much of it very different to what we are used to in the UK.On to the cooking school, which is located in a Bangkok slum. We were a little apprehensive but no need to be, we felt very safe and the cooking school was spotless. Poo is an excellent teacher and I can see why Jamie Oliver is doing some filming with her shortly. We cooked 3 dishes each and munched as we went. We will cook these dishes at home. We enjoyed the experience and it\u2019s great news that the cooking school now provides work for 30 people in the slum.In short, do it, a great half-day experience!"

This is real Thailand, the extremity that makes Bangkok as amazing as it is..The market you need to be strong.. It is a real market not a tourist attraction, (it has animals, insects and meat there, I found that bit a tiny bit uncomfortable but respect that this is the way it is here,) wet slippery, amazing array of smells from ewww to whoa, sounds, sights and wonderful smiling faces. Amazing place and a little disappointed that I sometimes found it a little hard to hear Noi who conducted our half of the tour group. This was of no ones fault, just circumstance and so if it came to the point I couldn't hear, I took in other things that were around me anyway.From the market to Poo's kitchen.. Poo still lives in the slum, which is extremely clean and not quite what you would expect.. But hey of course these are people too, there maybe not a lot of money in their lives, but that is not to say there is no pride! The cooking is a bonus. Poo is a wonderful teacher, helped along by Noi. Entertaining and 100% hands on. Knowing that the money from this experience goes directly to Helping Hands Foundation the community that you are actually within is heart warming, knowing that the kids in the community will learn skills that will enable them to gain worthy employment and perhaps break a cycle.Food was amazing, new friends from all over the world made within the tour group and a lot of laughs and enlightenment from the morning spent on this wonderful experience. Well done Poo on a wonderful experience .... And we wear our 'I cooked with Poo and Liked it' aprons with pride whilst cooking recipes from our cook book. A tour recommended to foodies and those wanting the real Thailand experience. (Perhaps the market not so good for people who have weak tummies)"

On the other hand, Poo told us that fish sauce is salt, lime is sour etc., so that you could change the taste of your own dish based on that knowledge. Poo does different recepies every day, so having done one course, I am desperate to go back to learn more dishes. A realy well organised, well run tour and everything was on time (surprising for Asia!) I am hoping to be back before long!"

I can't say enough good things about \"Cooking with Poo.\" A friend who lives in Bangkok recommended it to me, and it was an excursion that I will never forget. Not only do Poo and her amazing staff provide you with simple recipes that make it easy to cook Thai food at home (whereas some other local schools take you through so many ingredients that you know you'll never find the time or energy to use what you've learned), but the tour of the local market and the Klong Toey slum is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. You are sheparded through the stalls, which feature everything from live frogs and eels, to pigs heads, to the bright and colorful local fruits and vegetables. The staff explain what things are and what dishes they're frequently use in. Then you head to the small, but immacuately kept, one-room cooking school in a different section of Klong Toey...just down the row from where Poo grew up. Poo and her staff watched closely and guided us through making three wonderful courses. They also helped a family from Singapore, who had brought their six-year-old daughter, alter each of the dishes to make it less spicy for the child. During the session, Poo told us about how the school was started and some of the benefits it's provided to the community. About halfway through a group of 10-15 Bangkok police came through the area slum... at first we thought they might be making a bust, but instead they broke out their digital cameras and begin to laugh, smile and take pictures of the school and our class. Poo mentioned how their interest has helped make the area safer. After lunch, we briefly stopped by a little store next door to browse through beautiful cards, crafts and jewelry made by other Klong Toey residents and then we headed back home. It's a part of Thailand that I never would have seen otherwise, and I'm so glad I did. Cooking with Poo is a must for any visit to Bangkok."

Poo and her team understand that to us farangs, these foods are a bit much!

I am a vegetarian and by no means a gourmet chef. Poo and her staff made it SO easy and I was very pleasantly surprised! All of the recipes were simple and there was a staff member in front of my table the whole time helping me. They altered my recipes to make them vegetarian, while the rest of the class cooked meat. The meals we made were by far the best I had eaten during my stay in Thailand and I have been able to make them again easily since coming home.Poo told us some of her story and we learned how the cooking school has helped her local community.

Unfortunately, I waited too long and couldn't get the date that I wanted... Sign up early, people!There are tons of cooking school offerings in Bangkok, but Cooking with Poo is the only one I found that offered a different angle. Visiting the wet market may have been worth the money alone - I loved seeing the Thai people shop for there food and getting information on the different ingredients from Poo herself. Also, seeing Klong Toey slum was an eye-opening experience.Poo and her staff are lovely to work with and provide easy-to-follow instruction. All the food we made was delicious and simple enough that I feel I could actually make it at home... I bought the cookbook and plan on using it soon!"

The market had a very authentic feel. Our small group of ten included my children (8 & 11) and a friend's children (7 & 11) - four in total. Both Khun Poo and the other Thai ladies made the children feel very welcome and very much a part of the experience. The food was fabulous and enjoyed by all.

Loved walking thru the market having the different foods explained - thought it would be a bit smelly, but it wasn't. Lots of little stalls selling the freshest food you will ever see - wish we could have done a bit of shopping for ourselves. Or van took us to the slums where we donned our cute \"I cooked with poo and I liked it\" aprons and began chopping and cooking under the watchful eye of Poo and her helpers. We made 3 main meals, which were all delicious (I got mine bagged to go, as I couldn't eat it all). The class finished with fresh fruit and the best sticky rice and mango I have ever tasted. You are given a cute material pouch with your recipes from the class and there is also Poo's cookbook available - get her to sign it, as she is going to be a big celebrity soon. A great way to see \"untouristy\" parts of Bangkok, and also to support families in the slum, who would otherwise be struggling. Highly recommended."

The tour took us through the main parts in the market and the girls explaining the different foods made it interesting and offered great fun facts. The drive from the market to the place we cooked was once again very short and uneventful (always a plus in Bangkok). The kitchen was large enough to move around without being cramped (even though there was about 15 people in there). They had water to drink available and again a clean bathroom. Poo explained the dishes prior to cooking them and her assistants helped explain and teach along the way. Each of our dishes were amazingly delicious and they let us accommodate our own tastes/preferences (i.e. the vegetarians used tofu and I omitted onions from my dishes). They even cut up different local fruits for us to sample at the end. The staff was extremely professional and friendly. I would highly recommend this to others - just book ahead of time, they fill up quickly!!"

The event begins by a visit through the enormous Klong Toei Market, followed by a short walk through the slums to the cookery school. It sounds very intimidating, but it isn't in the least, and at no time did we feel uncomfortable or out of place, or a spectator to other people's poverty (although of course we were). The event is organised by Helping Hands, which is run by Khun Poo, a formidable and charming lady. She, and her helpers, guide you through everything, including the walk through the market and then cooking the recipes. Her enthusiasm and energy are quite infectious, and she is clearly a fantastic asset to that community. The web site is here: http://www.cookingwithpoo.com/contents/en-us/d33.html. The project is grounded in the local community, and offers a wonderful insight into Thai cooking, and into living in one of the largest slum areas in Bangkok. The food (you cook) is also excellent. To gain an insight into Thai living in a poor local area, and the rudiments of Thai cooking, it is hard to imagine anything as good. By supporting this initiative, you are also investing into this community. Strongly recommended."

I stayed with a friend for a week in Bangkok and she recommended that I try this cooking school as I was looking for a different experience.The day started with a visit to a local market which was, in some instances, overwhelming (the smells, the sights etc). Don't make the mistake of wearing long trousers as I did as you end up with wet trouser cuffs which didn't smell so good! There were 12 of us in the group and we were split into two groups and taken around the market stopping at many stalls so that the teaching assistants could explain what the exotic fruit, vegetables and meats were and how best to prepare them.After the visit to the market you are taken to Poo's kitchen to prepare 4 Thai dishes (well 3 really as she prepares the mango sticky rice). The chemistry of the group, the seamless way that Poo and her team work together and the knowledge that you're doing something to help the community really makes it a memorable experience. I have always been cautious about cooking Thai food, not believing that I could do it but have come home with new-found confidence and a willingness to experiment. If you're wanting to do something different on your holiday then I would truly recommend this course."

As soon as you have finished each course, you eat it and every dish was delicious! You should allow room for consuming a large lunch. There is a maximum of ten 'students' in the group and three staff so the atmosphere is very relaxed. On the way to the cooking school, which is within the slums of Klong Toey, we were taking on a walking tour through the Klong Toey 'wet' market. The market can be confronting with many living and soon not to be living creatures of every description, such as frogs, crabs, eels, beetles, chickens etc. One of the main purposes of 'Cooking with Poo' is to help to advance the living conditions of the poorest people in Bangkok, which it does to great effect."

We started by going to a large local market where we saw animals, vegetables, fruits, food and more for sale. The sights and smells are a very memorable experience if you are not used to seeing where your food comes from (you can stay in the car if you prefer). Then we went to the cooking class in the slums, right next to Poo's home. While some things were separated already, you got to cut up all your veggies and assemble. Poo and her team were very attentive in making sure you learned how to do it yourself so you could try it again at home. They also helped me change some of the ingredients in my food since I don't like fish sauce or food thats too spicy. You cook a dish then eat it. Cook another then you eat it. And you do that 4 times so you spend about an hour and a half eating (~10.30-12) so bring your stomach ready for food! If you've had enough however they let you box it and take back.Definitely plan on the 4 hours (8.30-12.30).Here are some tips if you do the tour:* Book in advance. Give it at least 2 weeks I think.* Follow the directions on the email confirmation, they get you exactly to the meeting point.* Don't wear flip flops to the market (which is how the trip starts), or you'll get stinky fish water on your feet.* Have a light breakfast as you end up eating quite a bit."

I wish I had taken my son so he could see that more Lego is not the most important thing in the world. We chopped and fried our dishes which took a small amount of time and then ate them...they were delicious.My hint is for you to book this tour about 2-3 weeks before you go as it gets booked out and it would be a disappointment to miss out on something that is both fun and helpful to the local people."

But as just outside the Metro station there a wonderful food hawkers, selling you yummy food, like sweet corn waffles (mmmmmm), breakfast was not missed. Plus you get the full Bangkok experience, as you are with all the others in the morning commute.You are being picked up in a minibus, that will ferry you around the two venues (market, school) and back. As that part of Bangkok can be best described as a maze - very convenient service.The market tour was a true eye opener on Thai food for me. Most food in Thailand is really fresh, and almost half the components on that market were still alive...The market tour takes about an hour hour and a half and is well worth it on its own. Most people would never go there in the first place and thus miss out on seeing true Thailand.You are then taken to the Klong Toey slum for the cooking itself. No need to worry about safety at all. You could not be in better hands.The cooking class itself was good and well worth the money as well. I finally cracked Tom Yum after years of (failed) attempts. The secret ? Go and learn it with Poo :-)You get to prepare three dishes, the desert (sticky mango rice) is mostly sourced from the market, as sticky rice takes about six/eight hours to prepare. But what you get to cook is good honest food staple. Stuff that most restaurants in Europe can not get right either. People who complain that the cooking at some other places is more refined, accurate, Thai, whatever, should consider that Poo charges not even half of what the commercial operators charge and that here you are actually helping a community as well (and not just some shareholders).You are given a fair amount of guidance, but if you can not cook in the first place you will need more that that. But if you do know how to cook (in terms of techniques) and do have a palate and know how to operate it, you will learn stuff. Most importantly how to get the balance sweet-spicy-salty-sour right. And once you master this, you are flying.I enjoyed my half day very much and can recommend this to anyone who wants to do something off the beaten track. This here is Thailand."

Everyone gets to prepare the food the way they like it, spicy, mild, sour or sweet. It's amazing how easy it is and how good it tastes!The entire team speaks English, which is a great effort from them -all neighbours of Poo from the Kloeng Toey slums, now able to work for sufficient pay and enjoy their work thanks to the Helping Hands program. The spirit of this cooking class is unlike anything I have experienced during my 2 years in Thailand -such warmhearted people with true concern for their community and a will to rise above poorness and to succeed. It felt like such a privilege to be allowed to support such a cause, while learning to cook the most delicious thai meals.Even if you are not a big chef or even if you intend to never prepare a thai dish at home, you should go anyway.

Khun Poo and her team welcome you with lovely smiles and take you through the local market. The explanation of different foods is interesting and the market is well worth the visit. The cooking class is informal and well organized with Poo giving great commentary about living in the slums and some of her life experiences. The food tastes delicious so don't eat a big breakfast. You can ask to take some of your food with you. The team is very obliging and this activity is a highlight for anyone visiting Bangkok."

Cooking with Poo would have to be the highlight of our trip, we had 12 people and they all loved the experience, firstly it is not touristy at all, but very down to earth, right in the middle of Klong Toey slum, Poo is excellent at explaining the different foods at the market and also helping us to cook back in her kitchen, if it was double the price it would still be worth it, ps don't forget to purchase the \"I cooked with poo and loved it\" apron, a sure winner back home..."

They are so personal, yet really professional and what the Helping Hands organisation has managed to accomplish in the Klong Toey community is incredible.

The only suggestion I would give is that they re-write the directions that are provided in the confirmation message for people taking the BTS. The BTS stop is listed correctly, but the directions given for how to get from the Phrom Phong stop to the pickup spot at the Emporium Suites is completely wrong. It took us half an hour to find the way, and many other people in the class missed the market tour portion of the class because they couldn't figure out the directions either."

The cooking is done in her own kitchen in the Klong Toey neighbourhood, the way Poo teaches, you will find it easy, fun and interesting.

The quality of her food was clean and delicious, compared to the vendors sprinkled throughout the city. Her instruction was easy to follow. She had great facility and excellent staff to assist us throughout. And she is adorable, friendly, and most of all, inspiring.Day started with a pick up from a well-known and central location off the BTS. Ms Poo and her staff then took us through a tour of a nearby \"wet\" market: fish, meat, fruits, vegetables, prepared foods, supplies. Not for the squeamish. Then she took us to her neighborhood, where her kitchen and cooking school is located. Each day has a different menu, of about 4-5 items, which her students will learn to cook. She also does a very good explanation of the supplies and prep work. We had an eight-year-old and ten-year-old who was able to do most of the cooking themselves. One of my favorite parts was constructing green curry paste from scratch in a heavy mortar and pestle. Also very lucky for us, it was May and peak time for many local fruits. Poo gave a lovely show/tell/taste at the end of our course. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised at how much we all enjoyed the day.This cooking course was not quite what I first expected, but turned out to be even better. Mind you, it is not in a sterile and professional kitchen, if that is what you are expecting. It is a rented room in her own neighborhood, which happens to be in the Klong Toey slum. That said, we (a man, a woman, and two school-age girls) had an excellent experience, and it was inspiring to hear Ms Poo's story of her cooking school business and the resulting expansion of development and growth in her immediate community. She is so busy with her enterprises, that I would not be surprised if she soon has to put the cooking school itself into hands of trustworthy staff. Thank you Poo!"

Without that enthusiasm, this enterprise would not exist. This class melded tourism and culture together in a wonderful way, creating an original way of experiencing Bangkok. I think how Helping Hands is reviewed really depends on what you are looking for in this class. If you are looking for a personal experience, then this tour is a 5 out of 5. No amount of money can afford a firsthand experience of the Klong Toey and let you participate in the heart-warming story of Cooking with Poo. Khun Poo and her team picked us up from the Emporium Suites at Phrom Phong station waiting with smiles. From there, we went directly to the market, which featured live ducks, chickens, fish, frogs and a squeamish assortment of Isaan foods and fresh produce. Nut was our guide (4 of us) and took us around, answering questions and piping up with information about things she thought might be new to us. Afterwards, we were transported to their kitchen in the Klong Toey, which is simple and clean. There are 5 rapid-heating stoves, so with 10 guests, we took turns cooking. This is actually a great set up for people who want to take turns cooking, enjoy the food, and have time to photograph each other cooking. Some people wandered a distance down the narrow path to explore, while neighbourhood kids gathered outside and peer in on us curiously.If you are looking to gain skill and become a gourmet chef, this may not be the place for you. From a cooking perspective, it is a 3 out of 5. Both the ingredients and techniques are simple. Most ingredients are pre-measured, but they leave the chopping (10 minutes total) to you. I would not expect a workshop with lengthy didactic teachings on how to combine spices or intricacies of a technique. If you are familiar with asian cooking in particular, you may not glean much from this exercise. However, there is always something to be learned, from substituting ingredients, to mortar and pestle, to little tips about when to add lime to cooking. Nevertheless, the food is delicious and plentiful. Most of us could not finish our meal!Advice: Our entire group wore flip flops. My feet never got wet, I just watched out for small puddles here and there. If you want, closed toe shoes would keep you dry but I imagine you would have more to clean afterwards. Dress light because despite the AC and 6 fans, the kitchen heats up fast! Keep a water bottle on you in case you over-spice your food or bite into a pepper! If you want this class, start inquiring early. 6 weeks prior to my class, I noticed that half the days were already fully booked. Book ahead because each class holds only 10 people."

Poo is such an inspiration! What a woman of courage and influence! She has used the skills she has (amazing cooking!!) to completely change her life, and the lives of her community. Our morning with Poo began at 8:30am, when Poo and her husband picked up our group from the assigned location and took us \"cooking-students\" on an adventure through Klong Toei market. What a fascinating experience! Poo and her team gave us a real insider's view to this beautiful community. Poo then walked us through her community to where the cooking school was location. It was such a joy to have the opportunity to see Poo's home, meet her father, and begin our lesson! Poo and her team clearly explained each dish. Everyone in our group participated in a hands-on way and had a BLAST! Who would imagine that a cooking school would be SO much fun! Not only did our group learn how to make three DELICIOUS Thai dishes, we also gained an experience that will truly leave a mark on our memories of Bangkok.

If its still moving then its a good sign! Not just live fish but chickens, ducks, geese, frogs snakes as well as those not recently departed and partially prepared for cooking, skinned frogs anyone??Herbs, vegetables, chillies by the sack load, the tour of the market was interesting and informative and whilst not for the squeamish my daughters 22 and 17 both had a great time.I even managed to pick up a meat cleaver and some cooking utensils at a bargain price! It was a good job we were on a tight schedule as I could have spent hours there just in the 'shop'!We were informed that until recently tourists were not seen in the slum and our tour group of 10 were the only westerners we saw. We all felt safe, the locals we met were friendly and seemed genuinely pleased to see us, It was then off to do some cooking with Poo and her assistant, we each prepared three dishes, Somtum (Green Papaya Salad), Tom Yum Goong (Tom Yum Soup with Prawns) and Phad Thai.The cooking was informative and great fun and we all enjoyed ourselves and we will take what we learned home.To summarise, a not to be missed, eye opener to a part of Bangkok usually off the tourist route."

You will see live and dead animals, bugs and fish. Many kinds of fruits and vegetables, Flowers, noodles, fresh pancakes. Pooh is filled with stories and information about the food and people at the market. Closed shoes are definitely recommended. I waited till we got to Bangkok to make the reservation for my us and was disappointed to see the first 2 weeks were totally booked. Fortunately we were in Thailand for a month so was able to make a booking on our return loop. I would recommend booking your class as soon as your travel plans are made. The classes are limited to 10 people and absolutely no cooking experience is needed. My husband can vouch for that. He was a reluctant student who thoroughly enjoyed the morning. Pooh has worked hard to make this cooking school enterprise successful. There are about 20 people employed by Helping Hands who are given a chance at a new life. The cookbook, Cooking with Poo, is a very interesting book, not only containing recipes but also background on the slum and some of the people working there.

I must say that all the three \"average-rating\" reviews here have accurately summed up the experience you should expect out of this program. Having read those helpful reviews and with a lower expectation in mind, I decided to sign up for it anyway. In the hope that I could contribute to support Poo and her community at the Klong Toey slum to be financially independent and self-sustainable. The guided tour in the Klong Toey wet market was notably interesting. We found all types of fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables on sale; uncountable amount of live and dead insects on display in large plastic bags; and live chicken and fish waiting for their turns to be slaughtered on demand of any customer. As we were cruising along the market on its wet and filthy floor, we could smell the aroma of fresh crops and the stench of dead animals permeating every corner. We saw how pancake (for spring rolls) was skillfully made on the spot. We also witnessed the laborious and painstaking process of making Thai's favourite dessert, mango sticky rice pudding (Khao Niaow Ma Muang). The market is definitely an eye-opener for those city folks who only shop in clean and air-conditioned supermarkets. Thereafter, we were sent to the cooking school located in the Klong Toey slum. Albeit its high population density, I must say that it looked rather clean and dry. Don't expect to see anything close to what is being portrayed in the Slum Dog Millionaire. In respect of the cooking lesson, frankly speaking, I did not learn very much. The Saturday menu comprising curry prawn noodles, beef salad and basil chicken was pretty foolproof. As an Asian who enjoys cooking myself, I know it very well how to stir fry. I was hoping to learn real Thai cooking skills, as well as how to mix and match different types of natural herbs in Thai cooking. Poo and her assistants instructed us to stir in certain ingredients from time to time but they did not offer much coaching on skills. Lastly we had a mouth-watering fruit feast, which was a great idea to end the program. After all, Thailand is a haven for tropical fruits like mangoes, guavas and dragon fruits! I am certainly not against Poo and her staff. They were a bunch of really nice and friendly Thai people who are trying to make a difference. Just ask them and they would openly share with you their lives in the slum. I am just trying to moderate visitor's expectation by sharing my personal experience here. If you are up for something genuinely different from your usual tours, or you are keen to help the local community, this experience makes a great itinerary. If you are up for some serious cooking skills, like what other reviewers said, look elsewhere."

We were taken first to the market where a member of the team explained all the different ingredients (live or otherwise!) to us and guided us round. Then it was on to the Cookery School in an air conditioned van. We made 3 dishes and watched Poo make another topping it all off with mango and sticky rice. The kitchen was well equiped and all the dishes were really straighforward but delicious. Poo was a fabulous teacher. If your going to do a course make sure you cook with Poo!"

However, as an overall fun and worthwhile morning it was a great day. Poo is an amazing woman and it is because of her I am rating it 5 out of 5 and it is great to hear the impact she is having on the community. I have lived in Bangkok for 1 year but the bit I liked most was the market tour with someone fun and who really knew her stuff. The school itself is within the local community and was great to visit somewhere new. Conclusion, if you are looking to become a Thai master chef don't expect this, but if you want an insight into Thai culture and life whilst learning some simple cooking then this is not to be missed!"

From the first email confirming our booking at the cooking school to the follow-ups before we started we knew that we were dealing with a professional organisation. We were picked up and taken to the wet market where Poo and her team took us for a very interesting walk through the delicacies including insects, frogs, tropical fruits and the curry pastes to name few. After the fresh ingredients were picked up we were off to her kitchen in the Klong Toey slum where we cooked 3 dishes and had desert. All participants got a chance to cook and to our particular tastes, then eat what we cooked.At all times we were gently supervised so that we got to learn as much as possible, but it was in a very fun and clean environment. The cookbook is a must as is the visit to the handicrafts where we chose some great bags as gifts for friends at home. Later we were taken back in the minivan to our pickup point.This event is a must do in Bangkok for the tastes, and the sights that you do not normally see on your trips. Congratulations to Poo and her team and hope that your success and good works continue."

We went to China town, MBK, the temple, Buddha,etc... and the cooking class was our most memorable experience.\"Poo\" picks the groups up in a nice area of town (a hotel lobby) and drives you to the Bangkok market. If you are with a large group, make sure that you stand close to her, otherwise it can be hard to hear her in the market. They market was an eye-opening cultural experience. We sampled some interesting food items, she told us how Thai people prepare unique items (i.e. roaches) and we purchased a few fresh items for our class.Next she drove us to her cooking school. The location is in the middle of the \"slums\" but rest assured, the school is incredibly clean. We watched her assistants santize everything before and after our use. Poo made cooking Thai food easy and fun. Several of my friends purchased \"I cooked with Poo and I liked it\" aprons after the class."

We headed off to the cooking school which was a short drive from the market. The menu is very basic, all we did was chop a onion and herbs and threw in the chopped meat or in our case the tofu gave it a stir and it was cooked. I guess that\u2019s how thai food is cooked, very simple and basic. Before you know it the class is over. My expectations for the cooking class was high and I expected to take away some useful cooking tips and hints but this wasn\u2019t the case. Nevertheless you pay for what you get and this was one of the cheaper cooking classes however it was a different experience and worth a try once."

We cooked prawn curried noodles, chicken with holy basil and spicy beef salad. It was all explained very well, very easy to do and tasted arroy (delicious)!

The 3 dishes we made weren't complex, very quick and easy, and easy to make again at home.

The group is divided into 2, so one group cooks, then eats whilst the other group cooks!The highlights for me were:The market, it was great learning the names of all the fruit and having some of the meat items explained (ie pork tendons).Seasonal fruit tasting and Thai desserts!! We tried about 10 different varieties of fruit, and it was good to see how some were prepared. I also loved the pumpkin custard. We also got to stop into the handicrafts store next door, where they have some great free trade items. I would recommend this school/Saturday morning class, for anyone wanting to learn some quick and easy Thai dishes and who is interested in seeing a different aspect of Bangkok.I would also highly recommend Poo's cookbook!!!"

It was Easy to register, there were good directions to the meeting place at the Emporium Suites and it was Easy to get to - right off the BTS line. Pick up was made right on time and we were soon off to the market. Poo gave us a little bio of herself and Helping Hands as we drove to the our first stop -the market. I have been to many Asian markets but having time to stop and get explanations of things was a first. What are those fruits we asked, well let's buy some and try them poo would say. Why are the eggs pink, let's buy one so you can try one and we did. Poo provided lots of good information and answered our questions with ease and real enthusiasm. She has a dynamic personality and her enthusiasm was catchy.For North Americans who like our meat nicely packaged and refrigerated asian markets can be a bit overwhelming to ones senses. Seeing a frog sliced down the middle and still breathing or a net filled with crabs who suddenly blink and you realize they are really fresh or eels trying to escape from the tub of water they are in, are not things we typically see in Canadian markets. That said it is all part of the culture we were experiencing and we soaked up as much as we could. Poo explained that the average worker in the market earned between 100 - 200 baht per day, about $3 - $6 a day and workers put in 12 a 15 hour days. Many of the workers come from rural parts of Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Burma and workers also try to send money home to help their families. I found this part of the tour fascinating and could have spent much longer exploring with some-one like Poo to educate me further.We were the off to our cooking class that was also located inside the Klong Toey slum. The classroom was very modest but efficient. There were 10 of in the class and we spilt into 2 groups. The first group took there turn at the cooking stations while the second group took pictures, helped themselves to water or to sit beside a cooling fan. Then as group one sat down to eat their first creation, group Two took there turn cooking. We made three dishes in total. We made 'Tom Kha Gai' - Coconut Soup with chicken which I loved and will make again, 'Khao phad sai gai' - fried rice with chicken, and 'Phad Priow Waan' -sweet and sour pork. All were good and as others have mentioned don't eat a big breakfast as you get quite a lot to eat. Poo also made sticky rice and fresh fruits (purchased from the markets) for our dessert.There are souvenir cook books to purchase along with t- shirts and aprons with the phrase 'I cooked with Poo and I liked it'. Each person in the class gets a small hand crafted bag with the recipes from their class to take home which was a nice touch.After we had finished we were invited next door to a small shop where local handicrafts were sold. It was very modest but there were nice items available.This was more than learning a few simple Thai cooking dishes, this was more about getting a glimpse into how many people live and exist in an area Most tourists would not see if it were not for people like Poo and her 'Helping Hands'. A truly enjoyable experience!"

Then we headed to the market which was unreal. I would recommend wearing closed toe shoes (not sandals) and to be prepared that you'll see everything here. But it was really a great experience. I especially liked that as we toured the market the staff bought all of the ingredients we need to cook our meal so we all knew how fresh it was. Then Poo took us into the slum where the cooking facilities were. She showed us her home and shared the history of the area. Oh, and the cooking. That was great too! Instead of watching, we all got to cook each thing on the menu. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a great inside view of Bangkok. I'd also recommend you purchase the cookbook for sale...it's fab!"

Even our 19 year old son, and his girlfriend really enjoyed it. Excellent communication with us after booking. Efficient pickup at Emporium Suites hotel, which is easy to get to from the skytrain. Started out with a tour of the huge Klong Toey market, with a knowledgeable guide, (Khun Poo herself and an assistant) learning about foods-many of which I'd seen in other markets around southeast Asia, but wondered what they were and how they were cooked. Now I know (at least a bit)Then it's a quick walk through Bangkok's largest slum to get to the classroom (yes it's located inside the klong toey slum), and the class begins.Khun Poo runs the school,teaches the class and leads the tour. She's funny, engaging and animated, and made our morning a lot of fun.We made three dishes,all of which we ate. So here's a tip...Don't eat breakfast before coming here. Cookbooks are available, as well as t-shirts and aprons adorned with the catchy slogan \"I cooked with poo and liked it\". Next door there's a craft shop selling goods made by people in the slum. This is definitely NOT the asian market style \"hard sell\" though, it's very relaxed and there's no pressure to buy. (but we did anyway)One of the nice parts about Helping hands is that it really supports the community by turning some profits over to educate children and to feed the hungry. Actually a lot of the profits go to these causes, and the list of accomplishments is long.If you are looking for a cooking school that will turn you into a Thai master chef then Cooking with Poo likely isn't what you are after, but if you're looking for a fun way to spend half a day, learn a bit about Thai life, and a bit about Thai cooking, while helping out a good cause, and enjoying a great (albeit self made) meal you can't go wrong with Helping hands. I had a great time."

Our day starting by meeting near the Emporium hotel in the morning, and we were promptly whisked off to the largest outdoor food market I had ever been to in my life. Poo and her assistant explained so much about the market, and Thai food culture (from the tantalizing fruits to the not-so-tantalizing insects and frogs). Everyone in the market knows Poo and her staff and are very friendly, some of them gave quick demonstrations of how some of their products were made. While walking through the market there are opportunities to buy some delicious fruit to eat or take back to your hotel (you'll want to avoid eating too much right before the cooking class starts...trust me).Once we finished at the market, we were then driven to the community in which the cooking school is located. It's a small area, but there's enough room for everyone to cook their meals and pitch in with some prep work. Our group made green papaya salad, tom yum soup, pad thai... we finished all of it off with mango and sticky rice and various exotic fruits. All of us were extremely full by the end of the class, but we all had fun cooking our food and eating it too, yum! Poo and her staff are extremely professional, knowledgeable, and helpful. I would definitely take another class with her group the next time I'm in Bangkok.Bonus: this group is big on giving back to the community and helping others thrive. That was one of the deciding factors in why I chose this school over the others (well that and the other great reviews from Trip Advisor).While Poo gives you the recipes of the dishes you make in class, I opted to by her recipe book to try cooking other food and I've been using the book regularly since I've been home."

However, if you really want to learn something and be able to make something decent on your own when you return, i recommend attending a different school. Unlike the other cooking school I attend the next day, here you weren't shown any special techniques to prepare the ingredients which is very essential to Thai cooking, instead you were told to simply add and mix the ingredients without much guidance, therefore the result is just mediocre and i felt like I didn't learn much at the end. The food tasted good, but not sure if I can re-create it on my own later. Also Poo didn't speak very good English, which could impact the effectiveness of her delivery and clarity of the instruction. So at the end, if you're looking to help out the community while having some fun in the process, then this is not a bad thing to do.

On the positive side, while participating at this activity you help a good cause as they are part of the Helping Hands organization that helps women and families in the Klong Toey slum.The highlight of the half day we spent with Poo was definitely the visit at the Klong Toey fresh produce market. You get to see what Thai people really eat and get to know many different fruits and veggies that we had never seen before. If you really want to learn some Thai cooking basics, I would reccomend signing up for a full day class that offers individual cooking stations.When in Chiang Mai we attended a full day cooking class with Thai Farm cooking and we definitely enjoyed it much better; we prepared our own curry, prepared sticky rice, cooked all together in the spacious kitchen, had our lunch by the lovely pond and had time to relax and wander around the farm."

The market tour was very interesting, but perhaps best experienced without a hangover, as watching frogs being skinned first thing in the morning might not go down well with the fried eggs from breakfast! I would have liked time to actually buy some food from the market (this is done for you), but they try to limit the time there due to heat etc. In December though, this is not rreally an issue. the cooking experience was great. Very simple dishes and no food preparation or washing up to speak of. You actually cook in Poo's kitchen which is in the heart of the slum area. It is both engrossing and humbling ad you come away with a special memory and some great new ideas for the kitchen. Go!"

The entire experience was very well organised and Khun Poo is an extremely sincere and warm personality. My kids loved the cooking lesson though my daughter was very unhappy at having to go through the market tour at first. She doesn't like wet floors, being up close and personal with livestock and was disturbed by the smell. She cheered up quickly during the lesson. My son enjoyed every minute and won't stop asking questions and trying everything that was offered. If you are not from Asia or live in a very sanitised part of Asia, the local market tour is a real eye opener. For my mum who does the marketing at home, she didn't think it was necessary to have the market tour given we live in Singapore and use similiar ingredients in our cooking. Overall, I would recommend that you invest the time on this experience. It's the highlight of our trip. the lesson is easy enough for my kids and me, a non-cook to follow. My mum who is an experienced cook was exposed to a different way of cooking and she seemed to have enjoyed it too."

I'm no stranger to Asian markets but the trip to this one outdid them all - fried insects, skinned frogs, bubbling vats of strange substances....quite a sight. Vegetarians avert your eyes!The cooking lesson itself was plain in comparison to the Blue Elephant but it serves a different purpose and I felt good to be contributing to the community. Poo is an amazing person who is inspiring to be around. The recipes were simple and used few ingredients - I thought that was great because sometimes Thai cooking can seem a bit ornate and daunting. When I got home I cooked two recipes from here on my first night back - easy. Poo is now taking this concept to the Phillipines and I wish her luck. Recommended, but make sure you book in advance."

This day really showed us 'real' Thailand. We started with a tour of the Klong Toey Market which has to be seen to believed - it is really fascinating! A good idea would be to wear enclosed shoes as we are from Australia we thought wearing thongs would be fine but we were wrong there was puddles all throughout the market and by the end our feet were wet and dirty but we didn't mind, if we went again though we would wear more appropriate footwear! All the locals there know Poo so they don't mind you taking photos of all the different stuff there - our families back home loved seeing the photos of all the strange and wonderful things we saw. The Slums are such a fascinating place! The cooking class was great, we learnt how to prepare coconut soup with chicken, fried rice with chicken, sweet and sour pork and we got to eat mango and sticky rice for dessert - they were all delicious but so simple to make and we have already reproduced them at home several times and they have been just as delicious. My boyfriend is a chef and quite a good cook and even he enjoyed himself, the food and he even learned new things too! I would say this class is great for all ages! Poo is such a wonderful person, she is very happy and a great teacher - we had many laughs with her. The class is such a good price and it felt good knowing that we had participated in something that not only that we really enjoyed but also benefits the people living in the Klong Toey market! We also bought 2 cookbooks one for us to keep and one for a present and the recipient loves Thai food and has already used the book several times (as have we!) This class really is something that you MUST DO while in Bangkok! You will not regret it :-)"

If you're in Bangkok and have a morning to kill or you're interested in Thai cooking / food then this is a brilliant option. Helping Hands is a charitable venture which aims to support people living in poorer neighbourhoods in Bangkok set up and run their own businesses. Poo and her team run morning (cooler) and afternoon cookery classes in one such neighbourhood. The day starts with an 0830 pickup at the Emporium Suites in central Bangkok. By far the best way to get there is to use the BTS and get off at the Phrom Phong station. The pickup point is at the emporium suites entrance just to the right of the emporium shopping centre. Taxi drivers may find the correct place hard to find. You are then bundled into a minivan and taken to Poo's local market which is a brilliant experience - she guides you through the market stopping to chat about lots of local delicacies (highlights include bags of live frogs - or if you're in a hurry barbecued frogs on a stick! and deep fried insects / waterbugs) and all manner of thai spices, veg, fruit and other cooking ingredients - she stops from time to time to pick up fresh ingredients from some of the stalls (not including a bag of frogs!) and then you're picked up and whisked off to her kitchen / cookery facility. The next couple of hours are spent making and eating a delicious 3/4 course menu of thai food - on our day we did spicy green papaya salad, tom yum soup and pad thai followed by mango and sticky rice. The whole thing was a really brilliant experience. Poo is a really enthusiastic and funny teacher and gives loads of great hints / tips and stories the whole time. Her team are really helpful and friendly ensuring a great time for all including our hard-to-please teenage boys. The only problem is that I'm now expected to produce a thai banquet for all my friends and family at home and I'm the worst cook in the world! All in all we really enjoyed cooking with Poo and will definitely try to do it again if we're in Bangkok.The cost from November is 1200 Bhat per person including all transport, ingredients and tuition."

It's small and we had 12 in our course. 6 cooked at a time while the other 6 sat/waited (but this worked out for picture taking purposes...plus each dish does NOT take long to cook). As the title above mentioned, we were slightly confused with the menu selection. I confirmed the menu we would cook two separate times with Helping Hands via email. I did so as this was part of my girlfriend's birthday gift and she has various food allergies. When the van pulled out of the meeting spot, Poo confirmed we would be cooking Menu #3, which is what I had confirmed. However, two other participants complained and wanted Menu #2.....low and behold, when we arrived at the cooking school, everyone was cooking Menu #2. Not sure how this happened, but we were slightly annoyed. Otherwise, this is a great experience that shouldn't be missed. Especially considering the charitable aspects of the cooking school.

We went to the market with Khun Poo and her team, where we found out about the foods of Thailand and Thai culture. Because Khun Poo is known by the market sellers you can take photos without feeling obtrusive, and there are great shots to be had. Khun Poo then takes you to her kitchen in Khlong Toei (the slum area) which is great as this is a part few tourists see. By doing this course you are helping to support this area and it's people as many are employed by Khun Poo and she and the organisation do alot for their neighbours.

When we were brought to the 'slums', you could see how Khun Poo interacted with the community and how they understood why 'foreigners' were in their midst. Khun Poo taught us a few tricks / techniques to use the simple tools they had to get something done - it was a eye opener for someone like me who is hardly in the kitchen.The kitchen set-up was simple and effective. Everyone had their chance at each dish and got to taste what they made. There was the option to bring the leftovers back with you but our group decided to pass it on to the children who will have it for dinner when they got back from school.We are looking forward to going back to try our hands again with a different set of menus. Since the class, everywhere we went, we were true critics of Thai food - knowing what was the missing ingredient and what could be done to make the dish better!"

First stop is the Khlong Toey Markets - these markets are for the locals, not jammed with cheap merchandise for the tourists, but local food produce. The Issan section of the markets are a bit hard to bare, with frogs, bugs & fish on display for sale. The fruit & veggie section is fun - Thailand has so much amazing produce that I've seen no where else in the world.. the King of Fruits Durian - if you can get past the smell... Then head into the slums where Khun Poo lives with her young family and into the cooking school facility. This is a real eye opener - hard to believe so many people live so close to the poverty line. The food you make with Khun Poo if yummy - but don't be tempted to eat all the dishes you cook as they just keep coming - make sure you leave room for desert! mmm sticky rice & mango! I then headed next door to the handicraft shops where ladies are making jewellery and beautiful greeting cards - I bought my years worth gorgeous christmas cards. I cant recommend this experience enough & the idea that it is giving these hard working people an opportunity to earn a solid income makes it even better."

The cooking experience begins in the local market where ingredients are bought, then we travel to Poo's home in the Klong Toey slum where the cooking class is held. A simple, efficient and tasty experience of cooking 4 Thai dishes is overseen by Poo and her helpers. As well as putting 10% of her proceeds back into the community, Poo cooks for the AIDS Hospice and takes local community members to the beach on Saturdays. Altogether a fantastic experience that is highly recommended!"

The guided market tour alone is worth the 1000B cost. We spent about 30 minutes walking the seemingly endless labyrinth of vendors. Poo was careful to explain the items that may be unfamiliar to tourists and what they're used for. We then traveled to Poo's house, traditional Thai residence and cooked in her own kitchen. There were 4 stations to prepare our meals at. The menu is predetermined, but there are 5 different meals that are posted on her website. We began with Pad Thai which surprisingly only took about 10 minutes to prepare. Our 2nd course was Cashew Chicken. Both were absolutely delicious. Our 3rd course began with a lesson on how to prepare curry from scratch. Each member of the group took turns grinding and smashing the ingredient in a stone bowl until we had the paste with which to prepare our next course, green curry with chicken. Wow! It was amazing. Just when i thought i couldn't eat another bite, local fruits were passed around for everyone to taste. Most were new to me, including mangosteen, dragon fruit, and a few others i cannot recall the name of. We concluded our experience with a delightful desert of coconut sticky rice with fresh mango. Everything was so flavorful and easy to prepare that we couldn't help but purchase Poo's own cookbook (500B). She was happy to autograph it for us and pose for a few pictures. Well worth the cost and would go back in a heartbeat."

She takes you through the market (which is amazing) and lets you see how food is bought and sold in Bangkok. Then you head back to the kitchen and cook your delicious dishes. Everything was excellent! We are vegetarian and she was more than happy to change dishes accordingly. Her kitchen is located in a slum, and it was quite an experience to see that side of the city. Ten percent of the price of the class goes back to Poo's community. She is involved in all sorts of community building outside her cooking school including feeding and teaching cooking classes to children and feeding older people in the area. Her cookbook is 500 Baht (~20 US dollars) and is a lovely little book. Highly recommended!"

You are picked up at the Paragon Suites, which is a hotel next to the Paragon mall, next to the sky train stop. A Van with AC takes you with Pooh (the teacher) to the market. This is where I wished someone warned me of what I was going to experience. I almost fainted and cried right there. Terrible animal cruelty. I think I was stupid to not make the link and decide to get into the market. You have plenty of opportunities to go to a market that sell other stuff. But this, was too much. Chickens and all kind of alive fish, frogs, sea food in general. It was very very sad. Then you are taken to Pooh\u00b4s home. Everyone cooks!!! It is awesome. You can have vegetarian option as a variation of every dish, just let her know in advance when you register. The best veggie curry I had during my trip was the one I made there and I never cook! Even the fried rice, was awesome! She is very nice, funny and makes you feel very welcomed. It is short but you do lots in those 4 hours!The cost was 1,200 baths per person.It was great besides the market experience.Enjoy!"

Cooking and eating take no more than two hours. You are dropped off at the Emporium Suites before 1 pm. Then quickly head into the Emporium for some cool air and some cool refreshments or shopping therapy."

The Klong Toey market tour was one of the best parts of our entire trip. It is very hot and can smell pretty bad, but it was definitely worth going through and seeing all the animals, meat, fruits, and vegetables. Pooh explained the different foods we saw and how they were used in Thai dishes. All the cooking was hands on. You get to make your own individual meal. The beef with cashews dish was really tasty. Other people in my family loved the green curry with chicken. We spent about 4 hours at the market and cooking lunch. We also got to try various fruits from Thailand that we had never seen before. Other cooking schools have you watch the food being made, but we really enjoyed making our own food. The cost is not too expensive compared to other schools, and it is definitely worth it! I would highly recommend doing this if you go to Bangkok."

Our guide and instructor, Kung Poo, was engaging, knowledgeable, fun and a talented teacher. Her English is excellent and and it is very easy to communicate with her. The $1000B fee was very reasonable given the length of the experience and the food we prepared and ate. Most of all, it was fascinating to enter Klong Toei, a part of Bangkok that I would have otherwise missed, and to meet people who live and work in the neighborhood. Helping Hands is a social enterprise, which made the experience even more rewarding. Highly recommend for anyone age 10 or over.

If you are in Bangkok and have had enough of shopping & massage then do yourself a favour and book a mornings adventure with Helping Hands Cooking School.The tour includes a trip to the market to buy your ingredients before learning how to cook several Thai dishes (you choose from a variety of menus) in a genuine thai house in Klong Toey.Khun Pooh runs the enterprise and is a wonderful guide & teacher - a great personality who will turn you into a budding Thai chef by the end of the day. This is not a posh sterile cooking school but a real home-cooking lesson in one of Bangkok's poorest neighbourhoods. Trust me when I say you will love the experience.The half day program includes pick-up in airconditioned van, a trip round the fascinating Klong Toey market to pick up the ingredients you will need for your cooking (tip: don't wear your best dancing shoes as they will get dirty especially if it rains). You also get to see some fo the stranger products on offer at the market such as frogs, bugs, etc. Then it's back to Poohs place (don't laugh !!) to turn them into a sumptious thai buffet. Class sizes are kept small at 4-5 which ensures you get lots of individual supervision and the class is taught in an informal atmosphere which ensures you have a lot of fun. After being shown how to cook each dish from scratch it's over to you to let your inner Jamie Oliver out - making the dishes and eating them. The biggest surprise......just how easy each dish is to make. You will leave thinking \"why the heck have I never done this before\". Another tip: do not have a big breakfast before going on the tour. You will cook 4-5 courses and the portion sizes are huge....thus you get full very quickly. We left with bags of takeaway.And the best bit........these guys are part of a charitable organisation who are helping some of Bangkoks poorest communities raise themselves out of poverty through supporting micro-business ventures. It's not charity but teaching people at ground-level how to set up a business - and you will see exactly how successful they are if you take this tour."

The day starts by going on a quick trip to the market. The market is clean and there wasn't a big crowd, so it was a nice visit. The class itself, though you do a lot of dishes in a short amount of time, was thorough. You learn about ingredients - why you use this type of basil over the other, for example, and Thai cooking techniques. They even have time to teach you how to make a pretty rose from a tomato. Very well organized and there were staff available to assist if you needed help at any stage. And everyone was happy and injects humor and quips and it is just a fun time. We made a full course menu, and all of them, I loved and will try to make again. The facility was comfortable. Air-conditioned area for class and dining and clean toilets.

She explained what each one was and how to use it in cooking. We were given a cookbook to keep and to take notes in. We made four dishes and also learned how to make red curry paste. We cooked over individual stoves and made our own dishes however spicy we wanted them. We also learned how to decorate the dishes and make them look fancy. The food we made was so delicious! I'd highly recommend taking this class - it was one of the highlights of our trip!"

We received instruction on local Thai ingredients and them had free time (10 min) to wander. The cooking portion was extremely well organized! Chop was demonstrated, ingredients laid out for us silently by very efficient quiet worker and then we chopped out own. Cooking was demonstrated, and then we cooked our own. The manged to provide pre-done items where it was not essential to the cooking (ex cooked potatoe) while letting us do the \"Thai stuff\" (making the curry part way in a Mortar/pestle). Air conditioning, good instruction, excellent English, this place was great. And I had a really great meal tha I made and can replicate in my home!"

We had a group of 17, split into small teams, which means the class is very hands on- you're going to properly cook and not just be the one in charge of chopping a carrot! Each student has their own cooking station. I loved making the spicy fruit salad- I experienced flavours I hadn't tried before and got to practise my tomato carving skills! I would throughly recommend the Sompong school, you even get a little tote bag and a cookbook which details all the ingredients needed for thai cooking along with pictures and written in thai and english. Can't wait to use my new knowledge at home. And to top it off the class is incredible value for money. You won't be disappointed and Kop Khun ka to everyone at the school!"

All the arrangements were easy and managed extremely efficiently, for example the pick up at Chong Nonsi station worked like clockwork. The market visit was highly informative, both about Thai culture and ingredients. The cooking instructions were excellent, with lots of culinary tips and skills. The food was delicious, and the staff preparation and back up was first class. All the staff were very helpful and encouraging. It was thoroughly enjoyable and a really authentic taste of Thai food and culture."

As instructed we met at Chong Nonsi BTS at 9am and someone with a red apron took us to the school in a car not far fr the station. We started with a market visit. One of the staff Priya (?) explained and showed us in great details the different chillis, eggplants and gingers used by the locals, the difference between coconut cream and milk and lastly all those wet spices like palm sugar tamarind and shrimp paste. It was a great practical class! Back to the school, Koy the instructor taught us how to make creamy chicken curry, papaya salad, Phad Thai and banana in syrup. It was my girl's first attempt at cooking and she learned to cut and chop, scrap and fry, all under the close supervision of Koy and her team. The team worked seamlessly with her and used equipment and utensil were moved out of the way quickly and quietly so that everything looked very efficient and organized.Koy broke down the ingredients logically into dry and wet spices and taught us how to mix them in the most efficient order. She also peppered many cooking practical tips throughout the class and beginners will find them very useful. As a first time cook, I'm very glad my girl was learning all the good and safety habits from an expert like Koy! As a group of 3 or 4, we made the curry paste first. Koy then gave a demo on how to make the curry and let us have a taste. Thereafter we cooked our own using separate stove. Even my girl who was apprehensive abt the spices, followed Koy's amount of ingredients to a T because it suited her taste buds perfectly! After cooking the curry we moved back into the air conditioned room where we ate our first dish wif rice. Eating this first was a great move cos by then we were all famished!The highlight of making the papaya salad must be the making of the tomato rose. \"It's not important but it makes your salad look expensive\" she joked. Everyone oooaahh-ed at the completion of the beautiful rose. Even my girl can do that! We had a fun class, had a f.u.l.l. lunch and even packed the leftover back. We even got a goodie bag home as a souvenir.For 1000BHT per pax, the class was money well-spent. However I felt the experience would even better if the school would also provide the transport back to the BTS. In our case although we were given instruction to walk back but it was a fairly long and tiring walk in e hot mid-day sun."

I couldn't recommend this cooking school more, especially since it was the best price for 5 hours that I could find.

This is followed by a well run course in a well equipped classroom. The staff are excellent and very informative. They explain, demo, then let you cook and help when needed. The support staff set everything up between food courses. The food is great and differs depending on the day you attend. This means you could go back for another course if you wanted. You generally cook about 4 meals per course but also get given a quality cookbook with their full range of meals. The course is seamlessly run and well worth the price. Will do again. "

The instructor is nice, has some assistants and lots of knowledge. The menu depends on the day, each day there are four dishes and one curry paste being prepared.I loved to see the proper way of preparing mango with sticky rice which I have made and eaten many times before, but here it tasted really great.It was an interesting experience for me because I have seen some details which kind of refreshed my memory.At the end of the class, you can either eat all the food that you have prepared, or take it to-go.Well worth a visit and with the price of 1000 THB very good value for Bangkok."

Before the actual cooking start, they will bring you to the local wet market and introduce the ingredients to be use for the cooking. they will take care of all the ingredients to purchase and you would just need to listen and hang around and of course you can buy the extra ingredients if you plan to bring home.During the cooking class, Irin show us step by step of the cooking method. All the ingredients are well prepared by the staffs. The staffs are well prepared and very organize, excellent job to them! We like some cooking method teach by Irin, especially crafting the flower with tomato is quite express us(you will know how simple it is when you attending the class). We can't finish some of the dishes and it is pack well by the staff for us to bring back. (the food still taste good after 4-5 hours from the class).Overall, it is highly recommended and have fun!"

It's nice that they give you a recipe book right when you come in, they tell you in advanced the menu and asked you if you have any allergies. The team is extremely nice and they keep track of you to make sure you don't ruin your own meal. Both cooking rooms have wifi and air conditioning. But get ready to get hot when you are cooking. The food taste was good they do it so that it's not too spicy and they tell you how to adjust accordingly. They also give you options of ingredients in other countries. As part of your class you get a tour of the market and an explanation of every ingredient that will be used in the recipe. For people that never wonder around market I think that's an awesome experience. I'm the type of person that love to explore around the market so this was right down my aisle. But it was definitely a plus to have somebody explain you what everything was. I usually try to go with a local to the markets but not everybody knows as much about cooking. But sompong cooking team definitely knows everything you need or want to know. "

We made our own red curry paste, Thai omelette \"salad\", shrimp and pineapple curry, and chicken with basil. For dessert we made mango with sticky rice (a Thai classic). For beverages they provided Thai iced tea and lemongrass tea- both were delicious. At the end of the class they give you a canvas tote to take with you. You also get to take home a cook book with all of their recipes! They take cash only and the class costs $1,000 baht (about $30 USD) which was well worth the value. Highly recommend!

We booked the class on 12th Apr 2016, Tuesday.As indicated in the website, we get to cook these dishes on Tuesday:(1) Chuu Chee Curry With Prawns(2) Home Made Red Curry Paste(3) Chicken Galangal In Coconut Milk Soup(4) Pomelo Salad(5) Mango With Sticky RiceA. BookingI made the enquiry using facebook messanger, but didn't get any reply. In desperation, I submit an online enquiry via Sompong Cooking School Website on 6th Apr & received a confirmation email 3 days later. The school admin kind enough to remind us to confirm if we have any food allergies.B. Getting ThereWe stayed at Eastin Grand Hotel Sathorn. It's only one BTS station away for us to travel from Surasak - Chong Nonsi. The admin informed us clearly to wait at Exit 3. There was a one way transport to take us to the school. In case we are late, the email also included a clear instruction on how to get there.C. Instructor KnowledgeThe teacher (Koy) speaks fluent English. She's very knowledgeable in showing us varies kind of vegetables & spices that we will be using in our cooking. Most importantly, she taught us how to pick the freshest ingredients. For those who are not familiar with Asian cooking, she explained it very clearly how to avoid the spicy chilli judging from its size, how to differentiate the herbs that has stronger scent, etc.D. A Trip To The MarketA visit to a local market is only available for the class in the morning session. Each of us was given a basket (to put the groceries in case we buy anything from the market) & a fan to cool us down from the heat in Bangkok. This is such a nice touch. More tips were shared by the teacher as we walked by the market stalls to purchase the fresh ingredients. The class fee include everything we need for the course. You only need to spend the money if you want to buy some ready-made spices in packets to take home & some yummy street foods along the way. Again, being a tourist, we were given 10 minutes to walk around & take photos.E. The CookingHygiene was practised throughout the course. Every basin is equipped with hand soap. Each of us wore an apron & a small towel was placed in the front pocket for us to wipe our hands. The teacher demonstrated the chopping, pounding, slicing techniques in order to avoid injury while handling the gadgets. After the teacher finished cooking a dish, each of us get to taste it. If we like the aroma (in term of sweetness, spiciness, salty taste, etc), then we just followed exactly the ingredients portion as shown. That will be our turn to cook our own dish. Kitchen assistants were there to observe how we prepared the dishes. They will jump in to help, but still leaving most of the cooking to us so that we could really learn from it. The cooking process was smooth. Everything was clean & put in place in a blink.F. EnvironmentThe class is air-conditioned, only the cooking place isn\u2019t. When we were there, it made us felt like they\u2019re our friends & family in Thailand.G. ConclusionThis half day class was the most well-spent time & the highlight of our trip in Bangkok. We have never cook so well."

I enjoyed the visit to the market and picked up quite a few tips on how to select your produce and what to look out for when picking your stuff. And when we went back to the kitchen to start cooking - it was such great fun! Our teacher spoke very well and no problem following the lesson at all. And of cos - our food taste great too! Each of us received a receipe book and a little reuseable bag at the end of the class. If you need to take away your food - they will be happy to pack it up for you too but honestly i think everyone just gobbled down theirs cos it's so yummy! The best part i feel - is that the receipes are easy to recreate at home and i'm proud to share that my family loves them too! Will be back and definitely highly recommended!! "

After booking on line, they sent very detailed confirmation with maps and directions, pick-up address and time reminding, no way you couldn't find it! They organised the classes very well, 4 or 6 students as a group, guided us to the morning market and taught in details and offered each one a delicately designed recipe book! The instructor was also funny and taught us some skills for chopping and making tomato rose, reminded the tricky details. After all, we enjoyed the whole class and the dishes we made. Plus, they even offer take away service for free, no reason to waste food, right?"

Even tho it was chosen bc it was convenient,i don't think i could choose better..this team is just crazy pro-active. Since you gonna be cooking lots of plates all morning, we gonna use lots of instruments, spices, ingredients, etc. They work so smoothly and efficient that you won't notice that your dishes are already clean, and the new set up is good to go. Impressively organized.Old people, little child, everyone should do this class. And most of the time u gonna be under ar conditioner, so don't worry about BKK heat.Super fun, mu husband made the best curry on that day and the teacher was calling him \u02c6cooking machine\u02c6 . And because it was valentines days, at the end of the class we got some roses. How cute is that:We had a blast, learned a lot about thai cooking. Congratulations Sompong team, u guys rock!"

Very good cooking class with clear instructions and delicious results.We booked the afternoon class and instead of a market tour we had a personal introduction to all fresh ingredients of Thai cuisine. In comparison to market tours of cooking classes we had taken before, we liked it much more.The class itself is very well organized and the instructors are professional, speak English well and give very good explanations. Also, they share Thai cuisine knowledge you will barely find in any textbooks. All ingredients of each dish are of exceptional quality and already assorted, such that most time is not spent on cutting veggies but on learning the details of preparing Thai dishes - and there are important ones! You will also receive a recipe book that includes all popular Thai dishes and loads of information on veggies, herbs and spices.They take a lot of care about allergies and special diets such that you can choose from chicken, seafood and vegan options. Also the facilities are very clean, you will have complimentary drinks through out the whole class and also wifi is available.Last but not least and most importantly, the meals are so delicious and of much better quality than in any local restaurant and street food place you will find in Bangkok."

It was my second visit to Sompong Thai cooking school, this time we did an afternoon class (14:45 meetup, finished around 18:30), the group size was 11 or so which might sound big but it's perfect and there are plenty of assistants to help you, the class was run by Eileen and then Koy, they go through all the traditional Thai ingredients and tell you what to look for when selecting ingredients from a market (if you do a morning class you actually get to go to the market too), lots of subtle differences between very similar variants of ingredients. You get to sample anything you want before hand. After that you get to start cooking, you watch the instructor prep and cook the dish first then you go and prep and cook after, all the while you have the instructor and assistants walking around being open to questions and to point out next steps if you forget what to do.Best of all though, the recipes and resultant food is unbelievably good, like ridiculously good... They really know how to put together great dishes. You can't go wrong at Sompong!"

I anticipated that it was going to be warm but to my surprise, the preparation and cooking area were well-ventilated and air-conditioning was provided! Barely broke a sweat throughout the class (except while walking to and from the market). As soon as we entered the class, the staff were really hospitable. Irin, our cooking instructor, lead us to the market where she introduced & explained the importance of different cooking spices/ingredients. Throughout the class, Irin was extremely helpful and vigilant over all her pupils. Her method of teaching was really good as she made sure to highlight common mistakes as well as gave great tips on the proper style of cooking a certain dish (something you would probably not find in most cook books). Another good point was that we were all given a recipe book, which not only contained the dishes that we were cooking on that day, but also many other delicious Thai dishes. The kitchen staff (those who helped with the preparation, cleaning & measurements of the ingredients - refer to picture) were very efficient in their job. One second there are used plates in front of you, the next second, they're all gone and replaced with clean plates and fresh ingredients!My dishes (massaman curry, tom yam soup, thai chicken fried rice, mango sticky rice) all tasted wonderful and delicious!Overall it was a superb experience and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would want to learn real Thai cooking! Not to mention, the price of this class was affordable and worth every cent!Thank you Irin and the team at Sompong cooking school! My family and I enjoyed ourselves to the fullest."

Haven\u2019t been to Bangkok for a few years and decided to book myself on 2 days with this cooking school last November. I must say this was an amazing experience to me. It has given me a lot of insights to my home-cooking when I returned back to HK.Sompong Thai Cooking School is well organized. On the day of my class, they picked me up at the BTS Station and drove me to the school, which was only one minute away from the station. Nancy, one of the teachers of the school first took us to the market to do some grocery shopping. She took us to different stores and explained to us the different types of Thai cooking ingredients such as herbs and curry. The class ran from 9am till early afternoon. We were all given a nicely printed Cookbook to take home with, detailing the different ingredients and seasonings in Thai cooking, not to mention the detailed recipe of the dishes that they taught us. The school operates 7 days a week and have different menu everyday. I picked Friday and Sunday this time and learned a few dishes. The teacher Irin was so nice and knowledgeable as well as inspiring and humorous. The place is very tidy and clean and everybody at the school are super friendly.Even though I am already a home cook myself in HK, I found the class and the teaching were very well planned, detailed, full of fun and more importantly useful to take home. Irin and her assistants were all well trained and attentive to our needs during the class. We all got to cut and prepare all the ingredients instead of just pouring everything into the wok. It was a real cooking experience from shopping for the ingredient to preparation and the final platting and garnishing in Thai style. I\u2019ve practiced all the dishes when I came back to HK and it all worked.I can\u2019t wait to go back to this school again and learn more about Thai cooking. My experience with Sompong was truly memorable because that was not designed to \u201centertain\u201d travelers but a real Thai cooking school that I can learn true traditional Thai cooking. Thumbs up and highly recommended."

It was such a morning of great fun with my friends and I highly recommend you to spend a morning in Sompong Thai Cooking School if you visit Bangkok!"

This is part two of my review of cooking schools in Bangkok and if you have not read my review of the horrid Silom Thai Catastrophe, um Cooking School, perhaps you should. Therefore and without further ado....If you're in Bangkok and if you want to ave a delightful day, take a class at Sompong Thai Cooking School. Clean, neat, and staffed by professional, courteous staff, it is a wonderful way to liven up your vacation.I won't bore you with the details of how I wound up there, but suffice it to say I am glad that I didn't waste a single second longer at the school I had originally visited. Not only were they drops of time I'll never recover, they also represented time I didn't get to spend at Sompong Thai Cooking School (STCS). I wandered in unannounced and was immediately greeted by Irin, a wonderful young lady who--as luck would have it--was to be our teacher for the day. I explained the situation to her and she said that it was no problem, the class had not started and that when the other students arrived, we would go to the market. Then she offered me coffee or tea and naturally, being an Ugly American and all, I chose coffee. Within just a few minutes, the rest of the students arrived and off we went to the market. The next hour or so was spent wandering around the market with our little baskets, looking at this, smelling that and listening to our guide explain the differences between curries, spices, types of ginger and a host of other useful and fascinating information regarding cooking in general and Thai cooking in particular, then it was back to the school to try our hands at it.Irin was waiting for us when we returned and the next three hours were spent listening to her unpack a veritable cornucopia of knowledge and cooking wisdom, all the while smiling and laughing and in general just oozing good will and joie de vivre. She is a true delight.She let me volunteer to stir the sticky rice (I did it wrong) and also rescued my tomato when I was trying to make a little flower from the skin. It was a massacre in the making, but after her intervention, looked quite passable. I think I have a photo to post. The individual students in the class cooked Mango sticky rice, Pad Thai, a chicken curry and something else which escapes me. Regardless, it was all good and we wolfed it down like a last meal. Obey me. You will go to Sompong Thai Cooking School and take a class. You will be glad you did."

We really enjoyed visiting the market place with Nancy, we learned a lot about the core ingredients needed to make good thai food. After the market visit we learned to make several dishes with Koy where she explained and showed us the techniques, followed by us making the dishes ourselves. The food we made was very good.

We then headed back to the school which was clean & offered individual cook stations for each student. Each student prepared and cooked Mussaman Curry with Chicken, Tom Yum Prawn Soup, Chicken Fried Rice and Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango. This is a family owned and operated business who formerly owned a restaurant but the current generation decided to do cooking classes instead. Next time I'm back in Bangkok I'll be attending again as the menu changes daily."

The good reviews this place gets on TripAdvisor are accurate. It was an overall excellent experience. Irin was our hostess/instructor and did a great job. It was an easy place to find via BTS and, as promised two young gentlemen in red aprons were waiting for the various class participants and us and drove us to the nearby cooking school, which was about a 5-10 minute walk (no transportation was provided at the end of the class so I had to walk! If it wasn't so humid, it would have been a nice walk.) After arriving and having some refreshments, we went to the nearby market. It was a nice touch that they provided baskets and a hand fan--yes, it was hot and humid the day I did this class. We learned all about the various vegetables and fruits and saw how curry paste and coconut cream and coconut milk were made. There also was time to buy a few Thai cooking items--much cheaper than I saw later in my trip. We returned to the school and began preparing four dishes: a red curry with pineapple and shrimp, a Thai omelet appetizer, a stir fry chicken, and my favorite--mango sticky rice. Everything was extremely well planned and fairly easy to prepare. Irin and her assistants did a good job moving things along. At the end of the class, they gave us a cookbook with the recipes we made and more....that, and eating the tasty dishes we prepared made this a very economical day as I probably would have spent nearly the amount I paid for the course eating in a restaurant and I can guarantee the food would not have been that good or buying a Thai cookbook. The place was super clean and they offered plenty of water and tea so one did not get dehydrated. If you are looking for a cooking school in Bangkok, I definitely recommend Sompong. They vary their menus too so if I go back to Thailand, I would try them again."

Then the very competent and good English speaking guides provide information about the various spices, fruits, veges where you are able to smell and touch each one, then a tour through the market. I won't go into too much detail as half the fun is wondering what is going to happen, but rest assured you will not be disappointed.

The class was very fun, we were taken to the local market to get to know thai veggies & spice/herbs. we were also shown how fresh coconut milk& cream was produced.we were then given a 4 course menu, consist with classic thai dishes. everyday is a different menu so you can check their site to pick the day of the menu that you are most interested. the first curry dishes was collaboration with your team, and the rest will be do it yourself. the instructor have a good sense of humour, it has a good atmosphere throughout the whole time. we learned some thai cooking techniques, veggies crafting, it was easy and fun! and the result was great, really tasted much better than restaurant!!! we were then able to eat what we've made there or with the option of take them home. if you plan to eat there, i would suggest to really have a very small breakfast. as you will be having curry+rice dish+soup or salad+ dessert, the portion sizes looks very small in the plate but it was quite full filling."

I initially planned to do a cooking class in Chiang Mai, but then I had time on my hands in Bangkok so I did some research and based on Trip Advisor I decided to take a class at Sompong's Cooking School. Best decision ever!! They teach a different menu every day and so you can choose what you want to cook based on the day you come. Just look on their website for the menu. I went on Friday (or Thursday?!) and the menu was awesome: Massanam curry, tom yam soup, fried rice and mango sticky rice. I was picked up at the BTS station as promised and we were driven to the school. The staff was so nice and welcoming. The classroom we were cooking in was simple, homey and beautiful. Our teacher, Irin, was wonderful, with a great sense of humour and speaking absolutely fluent English. She explained the whole process first and then we cooked our dishes following her directions. And the outcome was so so good!!! The only thing that we did not cook by ourselves was the mango sticky rice but that did not bother me a bit. The class consisted of 10 ppl and Irin had an assistant teacher who was always ready to help. In the end you get a cookbook with all the recipes (not just those you cooked on your chosen day) as well as pictures and description of the ingredients. All in all, you can't go wrong with this cooking school. It's an amazing value for money and you not only have a wonderful experience but can also impress your friends and family at home with some great Thai dishes! :) Also, if you are a solo traveler, don't worry and just go. Special thanks to Irin's assistant teacher: I forgot some things in the classroom and he ran almost all the way to the BTS station to catch me and give me my stuff! Thanks so much!!"

Then to allow you to shop around the market for what you want to bring home.After that it would go back to the cooking school and start cooking. Not all dishes to be cooked by you and some of the stuff are prepared already. However, during the intensive 3-4 hours you would be able to know what's inside and how to cook at least 3-4 thai dishes.Fun experience!"

Informative, detailed, welcoming, and such attention to detail, from the market visit, the cookery instruction, to the behind the scenes clearing up. We got to watch how the dishes are made, then it was our turn to prepare and cook. We tasted the original dish, and could then amend our own dishes to our own taste, according to how spicy we liked our food. Brilliant course, delicious dishes and great cookery booklet to take home. Book it now."

The price was more than ok, considering the class lasts about 4h, you learn to cook delicious food and you get to eat it.. oh and you get a recipe book (with all the recipies, not just the ones you did on that day). You should go before (or maybe check their website) to see what recipies she is teaching each day and then book according to your taste. All along we could dring free lemon ice tea and the room had fans. The staff was amazing and always willing to help and they were really patient. The teacher was amazing and so funny! If you want to do a that cooking class, I really recommend you book here."

I went to this course with my daughter who is 12 years old ( absolutely suitable for a child of that age who has done some baking/ cooking previously ). This course is planned and organised brilliantly . The directions to get there are very clear - we asked our taxi driver to call the school directly . He was given instructions and we got there promptly. The course was taught by Irin who was thorough and humerous at the same time. An absolute pro. The attention to detail is outstanding . We each had our own cooking station , equipment , utensils, aprons - all perfectly laid out . It felt like you were cooking in someone's quaint kitchen . The dishes used were beautiful . Everything from the trip to the market, to the demonstration of how coconut milk is made , to the demo of how to carve your own rose from a tomato - it was all brilliant . We cooked 4 of our own dishes .I am confident that I can now cook Thai food well. Absolutely outstanding experience !! Thank you !"

Environment: Very clean, except a few flies that were unavoidable. Indoor air-conditioned classroom for introducing ingredients and preparing them. Outdoor sheltered kitchen for demonstration and cooking by ourselves.Food: Good taste, great concept to let us each cook our own dishes and have a meal afterwards with our end products.Communication: Good English in general.Experience:Four of us (1 adult, 3 teens) found this school on TripAdvisor and contacted them through email. At first only a morning session was available, which we couldn't make it, but they arranged an afternoon session just for four of us. We love Thai fruit, and they were kind enough to purchase mangosteen and durian for us. Our menu included Green Papaya Salad, Green Curry with Chicken, Stir-fried Chicken with Cashews, and Mango Sticky Rice.Everything were in sets. We each had one apron, one chopping board, one knife, one set of ingredients for each dish.The teacher first explain the ingredients that are rarely seen, such as Thai herbs and baby eggplants. Then she demonstrated how to chop them and the respective seasoning, and cooked once in front of us. Then we cut the ingredients by ourselves and cook them, with the help of assistants if we need them.After one dish is cooked, they cover it for later use. When all dishes are cooked and reheated, they provided us with rice noodles and rice, and we sat to eat dinner. It was a wonderful hands-on experience to learn some Thai cooking, and it was satisfying to eat the dishes cooked by ourselves.Overall speaking, this cooking class is a must-go for people who are interested in the Thai culinary culture, or want something that is beyond the mundane shopping and eating."

When everyone is settled in, you are briefed about what you will be doing that day. We were taken to the markets to learn all about Thai ingredients and vegetables, and enjoy an authentic market experience. I can honestly say I learned a lot! Back at the school, you are allocated individual cooking stations and taken through each dish which you cook yourself! Everything is clean and easy to understand and execute thanks to the amazing staff. When it came time to eat the meals we had created we were blown away by how good they were. The Chicken massaman, Tom yum Gung and fried rice were the BEST we had in Bangkok thanks to Sompong's recipe. We were too full to eat our mango sticky rice, so the staff kindly packed it for us and we enjoyed it the next morning (it was amazing). It was great value for money. Thank you so much for this wonderful experience, we would recommend it to absolutely anybody of any age and experience level who seeks to have fun and eat some incredible food."

I highly recommended Sompong Cooking class for below reasons as I tried other Hotel cooking class. Sompong is the best ever.1. Pick up and transfer from BTS Chong Nansi Exit 3 which is quite easy for students and transfer from there to school. Arrive school, we have icy drinks and basket and bamboo fan so we won`t feel too hot going to traditional market. Comparing to this, Silom`s pick up location is quite not easy2. Teacher Irin explains all the Thai herbs in details and tell us what we are going to use in which dishes. Silom just show these are herbs and smell it, not explain in detail.3. when cooking, Sompong Teacher Irin really explains in all the details for every dishes and notice you how you cook to make dishes taste well and all ingredients presents beautiful. Silom only focus on ingredients presentation which makes your photos look beautiful.4. For the same 5 dishes, we in Sompong works for 4 hours but in Silom, it only took 2.5 hours to finish. 5. I forgot my recipe book in Sompong. When I go back, they find it for me named Doris. Lovely.I highly recommended to go to Sompong and will book again this class next time when I visit Bangkok. I will skip Silom. Silom is suitable for persons who only want to SEE how to make Thai dishes instead of exploring and learning Thai cooking. I highly recommend teacher Irin in Sompong."

Refreshments are offered upon arrival. Water and a hand fan is provided while at the market (which can be very hot) The market is clean and not over crowded. Koy makes every person feel a valued customer and provides times for questions and to explore the market. Back at the school there is plenty of staff to help with the smooth running of the class. Everyone prepared and cooked their own food in their own cooking space, not always the case in Thai cooking schools. I learned so much from Koy, as she gave advice about storage periods for curry pastes, Thai ingredients and handy hints to other aspects of Thai cooking. Everything has been well thought out and is executed extremely professionally. If you can't eat all your cooked 4 course meal (I certainly couldn't) it is packaged for you to takeaway. I was completely impressed with how much attention to detail has been thought of at this school. Definitely a must while in Bangkok."

All the staff working there was very helpful and we were very well looked after. The course itself costed 1000 thai batt, it is great value for money and we were so full we didn't eat until 10 pm that day. We were picked up at the BTS station and were given a lift to the school where we settled for a couple of minutes before getting to the local market.Water and a fan was given to us which I found to be considerate. The market tour was great, Irin showed us different ingredients that would be used in Thai cooking and we were given some time to shop for curry paste, thai tea and different sauces. The price at the market are quite abit cheaper than big c. After we got back from the market, we started to make food and the teaching was fun and spontaneous. Everything felt very natural and nothing was force. It was really refreshing.Refreshments were provided throughout the course and I loved the lemongrass tea.We ate all the food we cooked and the school also provided sticky rice and really nice thai rice noodles for us to eat with the curry. What was really impressive was how clean everything is, the floor was clean, the chopping board was clean. After each dish, the chopping board would be replaced with a new one together with the knife. Raw meat was put into small plastic bag and not once did my hands touched them while cooking. This goes to show how well they organize everything. The whole experience was great and I will recommend this to everyone who will visit Bangkok. You don't have to be an expert in cooking to join, anyone can do it."

The only reason it's getting a 4/5 is because I'm comparing it to the class I took in Chiang Mai - which I preferred, sorry Koy! >_<You get picked up bright and early from a convenient location (like at the bottom of a subway stop on street level). Tip: confirm the exact pick-up location. We weren't sure if we were looking for someone at the platform level, at the bottom of the steps, maybe the bottom of the other steps... anyways we luckily found our driver and off we go! You arrive at this building - the outside is where the cooking is done and inside behind closed doors and blessed AC is where the prep and eating is done. You get a quick intro (and a mini snack with refreshing iced tea) before it's off to the markets. Everyone gets a fan and a basket (Koy puts a different ingredient in each person's basket) and Koy talks about what to look for in coconuts, the differences in curry powders, uses of different kinds of chilies, etc. You then wander the market for a bit and you can buy stuff from the vendors for your own consumption.You head back to the building and start prepping. Each ingredient will be divided equally into separate bowls and you\"ll be given instructions on what to do - e.g. cut, chop, pound. The most difficult thing for me was the use of an actual gas stove top & wok, especially for the phad thai. There were guys standing around to help you but I found they were laughing at me more than being helpful T__T All things considered though, the food turned out great! Hurray! In the end, we ate: Panaeng Chicken Curry, Phad Thai, Papaya Salad, and Golden Banana in Syrup (dessert); the dessert was made by the helpers of the cooking school while we prepped our ingredients. I just wished we could have skipped the Papaya salad. It was a big bowl and I didn't care much for it.  Once everything is all said and done, you leave with an extremely full stomach, happy taste buds, and a booklet of the recipes you just learned. Unfortunately, you have to find your own way home from the cooking school, so be sure to ask for directions :("

Very well organised, the session starts off with a visit to the local market to purchase some of the ingredients to be used in the class, after around half an hour at the market we headed back to the classroom to begin cooking our 3 course meal - complete with mango sticky rice, yum! We also learned to make red curry paste from scratch which was an added bonus. Our instructor was Irin, she was fantastic and her English is really good and easy to understand ... thank you Irin! I had my 2 children with me (aged 12 and 10 years) and they thoroughly enjoyed the experience as well! I'd highly recommend this cooking school, it's clean, well run, very reasonably priced and they use the freshest ingredients. An awesome way to experience the culinary side of Bangkok!"

We booked it already before we came to Bangkok and i came to this place with a good feeling because they made you feel welcome already with the mails. The whole experience is very good organised and the staff is really friendly. The cooking school is a family business and you can feel that as everyone is very nice and caring. The food we prepared was better than any Thai-Food you can get in my country and they made the whole lession easy to understand. I also really appreciated that they told you what alternatives to certain ingredients you can use. Also the price was very good as you get a whole morning of cooking and awesome food you can even take home if you can't eat it all there. One of the really good things as well was, that they didn't use any MSG in their cooking. Before you even start cooking, they take you to the local marked and explain you a lot of interessting things, eg. the difference between coconut-milk and coconut-cream. I would recommend this Cooking school to anyone who likes food and cooking and i can only say the best things about this place. Many many thanks to Koy and her whole team for this wonderful experience."

This was my third cooking course in Thailand, and it was a very enjoyable experience.Sompong's staff were very welcoming, knowledgeable and displayed a relaxed attitude to the day's cooking. The highlight was the market your, with an opportunity to see coconut milk and cream being made, which helped understand the cooking methods later.This was an introductory course, as we worked in groups to prepare dishes rather than individually. We made the green curry paste together, getting a few bashes with the pestle and mortar before someone else finished the hard work. I appreciate that this was due to time constraints, but it was still a shame.I still learned plenty and was very impressed by the chicken with cashew nut stir fry and the hospitality!"

The five-hour program is extremely well-run and they manage to balance sticking to the schedule and making it relaxed (the air-conditioning and tea served were a nice touch). The instructors were very easy to understand and seemed genuinely interested in teaching us something and the helpers made sure we didn't screw up. I have tried my hand at Thai dishes before, so I understood some concepts like frying curry paste in coconut cream, but the visit to the market alone gave an education on how coconut milk is actually pressed, different types of basil and ginger, and so much more. The menus are offered online and we have a nice blend of pad thai, penang curry, papaya salad and the mango sticky rice, all big staples I wanted to learn more about. All in all, a great job and I would have spent 3-4 times this in New York City for basic Thai cookery."

First you arrive at the school to meet your \"co-cooks\" and teacher for the day. There you have a welcome drink. Then you head up to the local market with a small group and the teacher show you different varieties of Thai fruits, herbs and vegetables. After less than 1 hour you go back to the classroom to start cooking. You eat a first dish at mid-time and the rest for lunch or dinner. You get to keep the recipes book and are encourage to try doing everything by yourself, although the teacher makes the complicated parts in a central table for everyone. At the end of the session, you feel like cooking Thai food is easy (finding the ingredients in your country might be more of a challenge!) and eat so much that you might want to take a nap or a doggy bag after, which you both can!"

I purposely chose Sompong Thai this time because the course fee was the same as Silom Thai. We cooked Tom Yum Koong both times (again, a deliberate choice).I would say both were enjoyable, though I would probably give Silom Thai just a tad higher rating - maybe the instructor was more humorous, maybe it was the first time we attended a cooking lesson, maybe the dishes were just that little bit more delicious... But then again these are all quite subjective. Anyhow, I think both are so similar that you can choose one or another, depends on what you'd like to cook and whether their menus fit your plan."

My husband and I love Thai food before going to Thailand, so we decided to learn how to cook by using the local ingredients and seasoning. Erin was our teacher in the AM class that day, we went to the Indian market 1st, she explained how to make coconut milk, powder, curry paste and coconut & palm sugar, and after that she took us to the veggie shop and explained all kinds of eggplants, basils and herbs they use to cook Thai food! That was a well-prepared introduction before the cooking class! (FYI: I heard that you don\u2019t get to go the market in the PM class because shops close early.) After we went back to the classroom, she explained the schedule and menu of Friday to us. (You can take the printed out recipes away with you, they came in a folder!) We had great fun cooking with her and everyone else in the class! There was only 1 thing requires some improvement, my husband and I checked their webpage saying that it is available to take out your food if you cannot finish eating them. So we decided to share one portion and take out the other one. However, there was some female assistant asking my husband if he finished, my husband said \u201cYes\u201d, and he was actually going to ask \u201cCan we take out?\u201d But that lady took his Masaman curry away very quickly and dumped into the trash can. Actually, his curry turned out great; we were hoping to have more later. So that was kind of sad. Anyway, other than that, we had great experience cooking with them. Instead of the curry my husband cooked, I asked to take out the leftover of my curry, they packed some steamed rice for us as well which was very thoughtful!! We will definitely want to learn other recipes from them again in the future."

On arrival they welcome you with hot coffee or tea and some delicious cookies and let everyone get situated, they outline the trip to the market where they show you how to gather quality ingredients for the dishes that you will prepare, there is a chance to use the restroom, & then off to the market for a very informative & interesting 40 minute trip. Upon returning to the class you are offered the restroom, but required to wash your hands (attention to sanitation was impressive) then in great detail and with great patience they walk you through how to prepare each dish. I didn't believe that we could finish our menu in the time aloted, to my surprise we were done and had enough time to enjoy our delicious meal with our classmates. We had such a good time we rebooked for another class. We left class with a cook book consisting of our meal plan and good knowledge to be able to cook it for ourselves.

I mentioned that I would love to come back one day to learn to cook Padtai, and Koi offered to teach me right afterwards for only 300bath extra. Very professional and much appreciated!All in all a great cooking learning experience that I will definitely recommend and come back to next time with my hubby or friends."

I would say I had a great experience in here learning about how to cook a few traditional thai foods. Before the class started, the teachers brought us to the morning market and explained what kind of materials were suitable to prepare the foods that we were going to cook. During the cooking class, the teacher will demonstrate how to cook the food and then we did by ourselves after that. The teachers can speak fluent English. They are passionate in cooking and willing to clear your doubts at any time. Thanks for giving me such a great cooking experience. I will definitely come back here again !!!"

It started already with a trip to the market... simply great.. not only a great place to take pictures but the information that was given by Nancy was very usefull. There was also some time to walk around on your own to do some shopping. Then afterwards the cooking class itself... what to say about it: simply perfect... hands ons and with some humour. I did not know I cook such nice things myself... thanks to Koy and the whole team. Also interesting was the fact that alternatives where proposed for a lot of ingredients as you cannot find everything at home. This is really a must do when in Bangkok, even if only for a few days !!"

She made everything very clear to us and was very hands on when it came to getting assistance.We had leftovers to take home as we had made too much and they happily boxed this up for us.This is a must do if you have time spare in Bangkok!"

The guides were very informative and lots of great ingredients to see, smell and taste. The class itself was good, although we didn't get to do any of the prep work as this had all been done for us. Ultimately that saved a lot of time in preparing 4-5 dishes! They all tasted fantastic, especially the papaya salad and chicken curry. And best of all: everyone got a copy of the recipes to take home with them.I'd recommend this for anyone that loves food, cooking and eating. It's not too difficult or arduous. And a great way to escape the midday heat in Bangkok!"

Our experience here has almost completely changed our view of Bangkok.Sure, they are geared for tourists, but in a way that is highly professional and not in the slightest geared towards a rip-off - in fact, frankly, they are not charging enough for the service and experience that they are providing. Almost every other place we have been in Thailand has had terrible service and is just geared towards parting us from our money.Sompong showed us another, much warmer, side to Thailand. This is an old family business and is staffed by extended family, spanning multiple generations and their friends. All of them were lovely and full of smiles.Koy, who ran our class, is warm-hearted, professional and helpful (and gorgeous). We had six in our group, including the daughter of our friends who is twelve and our son who is thirteen. Koy and all of the staff were fantastic with the kids and we lost no fingers and got no burns! Nancy, who handles administration and also took us through the markets and helped in class was knowledgeable, personable and again, great with the kids and also handled the entire booking process very very well.This was a wonderful experience and all six of us were left confident that we could cook all of the (delicious) dishes that we learned today again by ourselves.If we can find the time, all of us are keen to go there again later this week for another class.We enjoyed cooking with everyone else who was in the class with us, from all around Asia and it was clear that everyone was having fun.And, did I mention? The food we cooked was absolutely delicious and as each person cooked their own, we were able to tailor spiciness, sourness etc. to suit our own tastes and Koy was very clear on how that could be done. For us, this was MUCH better than our experience of the food at Nahm last night.Awesome school and we would recommend them without reservation."

Then, Teacher Nancy gave us a quick run through of the day's plan before we headed to the wet market.Teacher Nancy was really helpful in explaining to us the different ingredients used in Thai cooking and the whole trip was really enjoyable and informative.When we got back to the school and started cooking, Teacher Koy was really encouraging and her explanations were really clear. She even gave tips on how we can re-create the dishes at home if some of the ingredients used were difficult to find in our countries. We had ample time to work on the dishes and she would often tell us to taste what she had cooked before we started. This is so that we can adjust the seasoning to our liking. She even gave suggestions on how we can present our dishes.I had such a good time in this cooking class and it was the highlight of my Bangkok trip! I can't wait to go back for more lessons."

There were a lot more people in the class than I thought there would be, but certainly enough staff to handle us all.

You're also given a handy recipe book (included in price) so you can cook for yourself back home.The morning class is recommended as the local markets have mostly shut by the afternoon and understanding the difference between similar looking but not similar tasting ingredients such as the fresh and sour tamarind pods. Be aware that there are 2 cooking schools down Silom Soi 13. I waited at the wrong one for a few minutes. The yellow signs with red writing belong to another cooking school and there are many of them. The 2 red signs are from Sompong, and the first is not visible til you're a fair way down the alley.

The food we made was absolutely delicious and we learned a lot about Thai ingredients, both at the market and during class. At the end of the market tour you have some time to pick up some ingredients to take home which was great as we had the experts and hand and therefore knew what to pick up.

We were met at the Chong Nonsi BTS station just after 9am and ferried to the school location where we enjoyed tea and we were introduced to our instructor Irin. After going over the itinerary we were split into two groups for the short walk to the market where we learned about the ingredients we would be using from Irin and Nancy (I appreciated the information about coconut milk vs cream - I've been buying both for recipes and now I know I don't have to!!). Another short walk back after an opportunity to shop and the instruction began, with sticky rice first up. Then we learned to make red curry paste and a thai omelette salad which we immediately enjoyed as an appetizer after being instructed on how to create a tomato rose garnish. After appetizer, back to cooking to complete our menu of red curry with pineapple & prawns and stir-fried chicken with holy basil. The food was absolutely delicious and although the website advises you to have breakfast beforehand so you don't get too hungry, I was absolutely stuffed when I finished eating dessert. I regretted the full breakfast and would advise going light on food before you start the class; if you can't finish your portions, they'll gladly pack it for you to take with you later. Finally, at 1000B, it is a bargain. True, you will be cooking outside instead of an industrial kitchen full of stainless-steel appliances, and you may not complete the entire menu yourself, but if you crave that, the Cordon Bleu is waiting for you and your money. I had a great experience with a friendly group of travelers from all over the world and a heck of a lot of fun."

            "review": "Half day cooking class. My wife and I cook Thai food at home but thought it would be fun to get some training while on holiday in Bangkok. After reading many positive reviews on TA we reached out to the Sompong Cooking School to schedule a class. Nancy and Gai were extremely responsive to our emails and quite thorough asking if e had any special requests as well as any allergies they should consider. I was especially interested in learning how to make papaya salad and they included that as well as Penang chicken, Pad Thai, and bananas in syrup for the half day class. The first part of the class we went down the street to a typical Thai market to procure the ingredients for our meal. While my wife and I live just outside of NYC and have ready access to many of the ingredients we used Nancy and Gai explained substitute ingredients that could be used. During the class Gai was funny, supportive, and kept the pace moving and interactive so it was a very fun and informative class. We ate what we cooked and everybody no matter what level they were prior to the class thought their dishes came out terrific. All in all this was a great way to spend our morning and the folks at Sompong were wonderful. Next time we come back to Bangkok I wouldn't hesitate to sign up for another class and learn to add a few more dishes to our repertoire. If you are looking for a fun way to spend half a day or more in Bangkok put Sompong Thai Cooking School on your list."

Then it was short ride to the school for a quick break and then we set out to a market, where we learned about and bought the ingredients we would be using. We were also given a chance to buy spices, curry paste, etc to take home with us. These things are readily available at our home Asian market, however, you can't beat Thailand prices. I spent $6USD for stuff that would cost me at least $20USD! Next began the cooking - we made Panang curry, pad thai, papaya salad, and mango sticky rice. Aside from the main teacher, there were many cooking aides to help us. At the end, we got to enjoy our food and take home any leftovers. The only thing I wish I had known before going was to wear insect repellent. The short walk to the market had mosquitoes and I'm prone to getting bites. Sompong thought of everything though and even provided insect repellent."

            "review": "Awesome food and a lovely admosphere!. My boyfriend and I took the afternoon class on January 3rd of 2014. Our teacher was the lovely Irin who did a great job of teaching us about traditional ingredients of Thai meals and about the tips and tricks of how to cook them to perfection. The class began with a visit to a local food market where Irin's collegue Nancy introduced us to all the fresh ingredients that should be used that day. Afterwards we returned to the school and started preparing the meals one after the other. First Irin explained all the steps to the class, then you sit down and start preparing the ingredients for your own meal. The coordination between the many people who work at the cooking school is amazing! Every time you turn back around to your assigned place at the table, a new set of fresh ingredients and clean cooking supplies stands there waiting to be used. Then everyone goes over to their cooking station - a gas cooker with a wok for each of the students - and proceeds to cook their food. Don't worry, you will get to eat it right away in the comfy dining room! The tables are arranged perfectly and there are lots of beverages to choose from. That day we cooked Mussaman Chicken Curry, Tom Yum Goong (spicy prawn soup), Khao Phat Kai (fried rice with chicken and egg) and Mango Stickrice for dessert. Everything tasted so amazing we couldn't believe we just cooked these things ourselves :)I absolutely recommend visiting a cooking class at Sompong Thai Cooking School if you enjoy cooking and eating good food! It's absolutely worth the cost of 1000 Baht (about 25 \u20ac / 34 $).Thanks so much to Irin, Nancy and everyone else at the School!"

I booked for my whole family on a very busy holiday time and they opened up another classroom / kitchen for just 8 of us. The setting was very intimate, and we were able to learn from the close hands-on instruction. We started with a trip to the market learning a lot about the varied fruits and vegetables and how to select them ripe and fresh. In fairness, a cooking course really isn't about the recipe. In fact you will get similar recipes online or at any other course. Furthermore, most facilities are of similar caliber, with clean environment, and one burner per student layout. But what sets these courses apart is truly the instructor... and in this case the instructors were incredible. The instructors teach WHY each step is important, how and when to substitute ingredients, WHAT the cooking process is doing to the dish, and the whole time they are engaging, sweet, encouraging, and funny. Irin was our instructor, and we all were luck to have her tutelage."

We both love cooking together But I can tell you this was a great experience at Sampong Thai Cooking School. It took only 1000 baht per person and we learned 5 different types of meals. Both chef and Staffs were friendly and very helpful. Last week me and my wife prepared Thai food on our son\u2019s birthday party. As we served it, it was very strange experience for the guests but as they tested they responded amazingly. Everyone praised our choice and the party was very successful due to that Thai food only. We are really thankful to the Sampong Thai Cooking School."

You don't have to be a master chef to come here and mixing with other nationalities enables you to share both culinary and cultural differences. Instruction is great, everything from providing the ingredients to clearing away all done by assistants allowing you to have a trouble free lesson and everyone having their own cooking station. Eat in the dining room which is so comfortable and share each others stories or take it away In boxes provided. Cooking is easy and tastes great and you will not find another course that provides value for money like this school. A must do in Bangkok."

Nancy picked us up at the BTS station with a quick car ride to the cooking school. We were very warmly welcomed with beverages and an introduction to the cooking class and then off to the market we went baskets and all. I love that at the market they were able to explain about each individual ingredient that we would be using and took the time to allow us to taste and sniff everything. A quick walk back to the school and cooking began! We cooked four courses and each was better than the next! One of the best things about this is that you can cook your dishes to taste, whether it be more or less sweet or spicy. Irene was fantastic at explaining each step along the way. The process was very efficient and the rest of the staff cleaned and set up while we were learning and then everything was ready when it was our turn. Everyone has their very own station and does every step themselves with help, as needed. I don\u2019t cook often and I learned so much about Thai cooking in general, it was quite fun even for non-cooking enthusiasts. The entire day was just fantastic. Our favorite thing about the day aside from cooking and eating was the atmosphere. We had such a great group and it felt like a family sitting down to cook together. The whole day was a lot of laughs and good fun. I would greatly recommend anyone choose this awesome cooking school. Thank you Irene, Nancy, and team! We really felt like family."

The team was extremely well prepared and organised. After a very hearty sa wa dee khrap (hello) we were allocated our workstations and the days' proceedings were explained. Not soon after our hearty welcome, we were all handed our own shopping baskets and fans to cool our faces. The 5 minute stroll to the wet market was extremely interesting and was key to the course. As visitor to Thailand one does not always understand what you are looking at when you explore the stalls in the markets and streets. The tour of the market added a whole new dimension to enjoying food in Thailand and helped to understand the food, street smells and the tastes. We amongst others, saw how coconut milk was made and learnt how that was different from coconut cream. A whole new world also opened when we were shown the many types of basil, eggplant, chilies, coriander etc. and what the different uses are.The course was completely hands-on. Cooking instructions were easy to follow and no prior cooking experience is needed to make the most unbelievable dishes that one could feast on. I would recommend the course to the traveller who would like to learn more about Thai cooking. The course is however also excellent if one seeks a very nice fun-filled day which is ended off with excellent food. Excellent experience all-round."

This ended up being a really fun and informative experience. The school itself is charming and spotlessly clean. The staff are professional, fun and attentive. The price was extremely reasonable. I really enjoyed learning about the ingredients used in Thai cooking. Most of the prep work was already done for us, such as measuring and assembling the ingredients, but we did the actual cooking in the wok. We worked and dined at tables of six, and it was enjoyable to chat with fellow travellers from around the world.It's worth noting that this is an experience that is fun to do if you're with a friend but is also really enjoyable if you're solo, as I was. Booking online was simple, and I received a reply by email almost immediately. I will absolutely do this again if I'm in Bangkok again."

I feel excited and would love to cook for my family once I return to my own country. Strongly recommended! Graeme & Justine"

Sompong is a family business with a warm and welcoming environment where I felt right at home. At a nearby market, Teacher Nancy showed us many different vegetables and herbs, explaining how Thais use them in the recipes. It was good to have this basic knowledge, especially for beginners like me. We made 4 different dishes, with Teacher Koy explaining clearly and demonstrating the process to all of us. We all had our own cooking stations and supplies, and the staff were very attentive to making sure we had everything we needed. My favorite recipes were the Mussaman Curry and Golden Banana in Coconut Milk. After cooking, we sat down in an air-conditioned dining area with mangoes and watermelon to supplement an already delicious meal! I can't say enough good things about this cooking school. The staff treats you like family, the environment is homey and professional, and the recipes are simply delicious. I will make a point of returning, hopefully for all of the sessions so I can learn each recipe!"

The market tour that began our experience was informative with the opportunity to obtain some ingredients for our own pantry (these were acceptable to Australian Customs on out return home). The food was interesting and there was plenty of help from staff in the preparation, as well as having lots of fun. Key was delightful and was happy to include other recipes in our take home cookbook, even when we didn't cook them that day. We were provided with lots of hints along the way about Thai cooking in general as well. Just make sure to write down all those hints in your cookbook, as I found I had remembered some but not all of Koy's hints. Thanks to the Sompong team, my Musaman is the talk of the family at home. Yum!"

The pace was relaxed, but we learnt a lot, and it was very hands on so we also got to practice. There. We're plenty of staff on hand to help out, so we got through lots quickly. The walk around the markets was interesting, and the lunch we produced at the end of the session was delicious! Overall this was interesting and fun.

We started off with some home-made ice tea and then a visit to a nearby market, where the fundamentals of Thai Ingredients where explained. Then we went back to start cooking. Our Teacher (Lana) was very humorous, resourceful, had a very high level of English and is a good instructor: she learned us some very nice (and easy) tricks on how to decorate using vegetables, how to plate items, and some handy tips on how to select food and how to cut it (more) quickly.The setting is very cute and all the staff is very helpful and friendly: They make a good kitchen team!. Our group was very international (Dutch, Spanish, German, Japanese, Canadian and Taiwanese) and we had a lot of fun, it all was very relaxed. Having been a self-thought chef and restaurant manager in many countries around the world, I was impressed by the professionalism, attention to detail and overall atmosphere that was created.We were there on a Sunday and learned to make 5 items \u2013 family recipes, not westernized. All came out with a perfect balance of flavors, a recipe book was us to bring home which also featured a lot of background information.The price/quality ratio here is really, really good \u2013There are many cooking schools in Bangkok, but after this visit here - I really do not see why anyone would want to go anywhere else! I can highly recommend Sompong one and will definitely return on a next visit."

            "review": "best group cooking class experience. This was the cheapest cooking school that I found at 1000baht per person, and in my view, apart from the 1:1 class I attended, this was the best. I tried 4 cooking schools and 1 hotel cooking demonstration altogether. On arrival I was given a cool drink and a choice of tea and requested to take my shoes off. This answered my first question... what to wear on my feet. Coming from a country where OHS is OTT I was concerned that I should have brought closed in shoes, but chose to wear sandals anyway because of the heat. I needn't have worried, bare feet was the norm here. I had tried to book an afternoon class but they advised I move to the morning class because of the heat (or maybe because they didn't have anyone else booked). The preparation room and cooking stations are in a covered outdoor verandah, so not airconditioned but plenty of fans and plenty of water to drink. The morning started with a trip to the market but as my knees were hurting from the previous day's walking I opted out of this and just stayed at the cooking school - drinking cool drinks, eating home made cookies and reading all their previous visitors comments and photos displayed on the walls. I also had a long conversation with Koy and the class teacher (sadly, I didn't write down her name). I found out that this was a family business run by Koy who was living here with her mother and aunt. Koy had learned to cook with her aunt in the family restaurant. This was traditional family cooking at it's best!When the others arrived back from market we donned our aprons and washed our hands ready to begin. We were reminded frequently to wash our hands and not touch our faces so that nobody got chili in their eyes. Each person was given their recipe book and a pencil to write down notes. There were 2 tables of students, 5 on my table and 7 on the other table. The school takes up to 30 students but divides into 2 classes in separate premises, so I think that means max of 15 in a class. This was fine because everyone was cooking the same dish and there were lots of helpers as well as the main teacher. The teacher started by talking about the whole menu, and the role of curry pastes. Then she would explain each dish and demonstrate the preparation of vegetables. This was followed by the students preparing their vegetables... so it was easy to look around if you had forgotten what to do next, and plenty of helper teachers wandering around to jump in when someone was stuck. Then the teacher would demonstrate the cooking of the dish, ending with her demonstrating presentation of the dish. Then the students cooked and decorated their dish with plenty of help from the helper teachers. The dessert dish of custard in pumpkin was cooked as a group, one for each table. So each student took a turn in the preparation of it. The teacher would explain the key ingredients, and which could be left out or substituted if necessary. She also explained medicinal purposes of some of the ingredients... like which ones act as a laxative... explaining why so many visitors get diarrhoea when coming to this culture... it's not food poisoning!!!!!! There were plenty of opportunities to take photos, the teacher helpers also willing to take photos at opportune moments... and plenty of time to write notes in the recipe book - which I did frequently as there was so much verbal information that was not written in the recipe book. After all the dishes were complete we retreated to the airconditioned dining room where all our dishes were laid out on the table, and staff added steamed rice and noodles. They offered coke, water and tea to drink with the meal. We each ate our own dishes and had more than one share of the pumpkin dessert. We were also treated to complimentary mango and sticky rice. The mango was the best mango I have ever tasted... and I have eaten lots of mango! The staff packed up the leftovers in plastic containers and even gave me extra servings of the custard in pumpkin and sticky rice to take home to my husband. One potential disadvantage is that you are all cooking the same dish. But really, I found this made it easier for us as a group as you could see what each person was doing, and it helped cement correct/incorrect techniques. The recipe book was fairly basic so I was writing lots of notes so I would remember specific instructions at home, and the repetition watching others helped me to keep up. Also much of the technique is learned, and can be applied to other things, so it is the technique of preparation and cooking that is learned more than the specific dishes. At another cooking school where we were cooking different dishes I found it much more confusing to follow the instructions for my own dishes. This is particularly so when the English is not so great, but the English spoken here at Sompong was excellent and I had no trouble understanding. Obviously it works out better if you are staying in an apartment rather than a hotel to be able to use all the leftovers for another meal."

Secondly, the recipes were standards found in Thai restaurants, and they were not complicated. Third, the food was AWESOME!!! We started with a trip to the market, which was fascinating and informative. Then, we started the cooking class, which began with a demonstration, after which time each person had his/her own cooking station to prepare the three dishes. We were supervised and advised when there was too much or not enough heat. Finally, the teacher and all her staff were delightful. Strongly recommend."

The group size was too big to really keep focus when the teacher explained importand details. This was different at Somphong Thai Cooking school. This time I wanted to bring some thai cooking skills home. And I feel I will. A warm greeting with cold drinks was followed by the standard market visit. The tour was interesting and well thought out. There was no pressure to buy third party goods that the school would get comission for. The teacher Koy was friendly and patient with our questions. When we headed back to the school we made feel like at home. We cooked Red Curry, Stir-fried prawns in tamarind, Larb Gai and Sticky rice Mango. A nice set, which was'nt too much of a challange to eat. The thing I liked the most about the style of teaching was the constant reminder to wash hands and the possible substitutes for some \"thai-only\" ingredients.We had no breakfast and that was ok like that. Bare in mind not to eat everything of your dishes, since they will pack the leftovers \"to go\" and you will still be able to enjoy the dessert.After all, this cooking class was a very memorable thing to do with my girlfriend. Can recommend this place thoroughly for people who want to bring home some easy-to-use recepies."

We visited Sompong Cooking school in September 2012, and one thing lead to another after that day and we never got to writing the review which the experience demanded. The reason we do it now, despite the delay, is that the one visit with Koi changed the way we eat, permanently.We were lucky in a special way on the day of our course in that the other 4 students didn't pitch (it was in the green season, so more quiet). We had Koi to ourselves, and the wonderful thing about this was that there was literally no place to hide. When the time came to cut ingredients as she'd shown, we pretty much had to do so under close scrutiny. We are sure it is that way even in large classes, but are both pretty bad students in general, and tend to think we'll get it later. Being alone had the wonderful effect of transforming a simple action into a sort of fundamental understanding. The one-day course also ruined our eating experiences over the next 10 days as nothing we ordered was as nice as what we made at Sompong, with Koi.Returning home we found that what we'd learned enabled us to be creative in addition to making a few standard dishes. It is this we are most grateful for; it is this that demands a late review. No other cooking course we've taken has had that effect.Go there. We hope it changes you too."

They also keep reminding us to wash our hands to be sure we keep our food clean. Nothing beats enjoying your own cook thai food for lunch. You will be amazed at what you can cook with some guidance; the food tasted better than in reataurants!.

The morning started with a trip to a small local market, where our teacher Amph introduced us to various ingredients. She explained the various types of peppers, eggplants and other vegetables. It was very interesting to see the coconut milk vendor and learn how he makes his cream and milk. We ended the trip with a few minutes to shop for ready made curries and other Thai ingredients.Back at the school, which is in a small house at the end of a quiet lane in Silom, we each had our own work station and tray with ingredients. We started with curry paste, which we all made together. With only 8 students, it was the perfect size group. Then we made a fabulous shrimp curry, learning several techniques to ensure a creamy and perfect curry. We also made stir fried chicken and Thai omelet salad. The most interesting dish was the red ruby in coconut milk desert - a popular Thai desert that I'd never seen before. The school has a very clean toilet, free wifi (not that anyone used it) and is very clean. It does not have air conditioning so it can be quite hot even with the fans. I highly recommend this cooking school - it is small, simple and the food was great!"

I picked Somphong based on trip advisor reviews as well as the fact that it's in a fairly central location in Silom and they offer a complimentary pick up at the BTS station. No regrets whatsoever. Koy Is a great teacher, explaining the techniques and ingredients in an easy to understand manner. Given the fact that it's a 4 hour session for 5 dishes, which includes a curry paste, which includes a 40 min visit to a nearby market, it is inevitable that some of the dishes have to be prepared as a class, with the instructor demonstrating and an opportunity for a few students to try their hand at it (e.g. Mango sticky rice). Not withstanding, it is helpful to have seen how these dishes are prepared and I'm sure that with the recipe book given by Koy, I can cook this dish on my own. Overall, the class had a good mix of learning to prepare the ingredients (Koy shared safe and efficient practices for cutting, slicing, chopping, pounding), practicing our knife skills, and actual cooking. It is gratifying to have prepared a Thai dish from fresh ingredients instead of a store bought paste! I appreciated that some of the ingredients were prepared by Koy's team beforehand (e.g. Onions and garlic were peeled, so all we had to do was chop it up)Another side benefit, you get to meet people from differents parts of the workd who share a passion for food. I had such great time on Tuesday, I signed up again for the Wednesday class. Highly recommended!"

While I live in San Francisco and am exposed to a variety of thai foods, this is my first trip to Thailand so I still am unsure what to order and expect. This was a great class to understand the process of thai food, the ingredients and the names of a variety of dishes. We started the course with a walk to the local market which was very informative and interesting. I learn a lot about ingredients specific to Thailand and in general. Back in the classroom we were more of assembler than cooks, as all of the ingredients were prepped and laid out for us. However, I did learn a few tips along the way. After making four dishes we were able to sit down and enjoy our own dishes. These were shockingly delicious based on how simple they were. Am I a better cook having taken this course? I am not sure, but the experience was highly enjoyable and I now have a better understanding of the process and ingredients that go into many thai dishes. That alone was worth the cost of the course. The staff was very friendly and knowldeI don't know if I would consider this a cooking class as much as a assembly course. Most of the ingredients were already prepped for us and we were simply following directions for cooking times. Realistically this is the only way possible for the time"

You get your own tray of ingredients and, once it has been demonstrated how to prepare them, off you go. All the ingredients are fresh, including the coconut milk, no reliance on tins. You make your own curry paste, again, no use of electric blenders which never achieve the authentic tastes that you get from a pestle and mortar.I would thoroughly recommend this course; the staff are friendly, helpful and really do know how to cook Thai food."

Koy not only helped us find these fresh flowers at the market but also her grandmother helped us dry them out too! Koy made us feel so welcomed that it was like cooking with a friend at her home!We loved the extensive 5- course menu that we prepared. Making our own curry paste was so much fun! Can't say enough good things about our experience. Thank you is for the hospitality and the memories from all of us!"

From the moment we arrived the staff brought us ice tea and biscuits whilst we waited for the rest of the class to turn up (we were a Sunday afternoon class-menu red curry, tamarind prawns, spicy chicken salad, mango and sticky rice). We then went to the local market where local produce was explained to us, and we could have a smell and feel of some of the unusual (to me at least) veg and herbs. Some was bought and we returned to the class to start making the dishes. The class was excellent, each person made their own dish so could tailor the spicy ness etc (or omit ingredients if allergies were noted) the teaching was great, and hints were given along the way by the assistants. Everyone was very friendly, questions were encouraged, email contact prior to the class was very helpful and responses were very quick. Overall, a brilliant time was had by me and my three friends, highly recommended, an a brilliant way for us to spend our last day in Thailand! Do not miss this!"

I thought I knew where I was going, but got lost and missed the class. I called the next day to apologize rebook. They couldn't have been more gracious and understanding. I was met at the Skytrain station by the lovely Amp in a red apron and small wicker basket. She explained that I was getting a private class that afternoon! We grabbed a taxi to the nearby market where Amp explained all the different vegetables and spices we would be using.Back at the school, which is just a block off Silom road, I was welcomed by the staff in the open air kitchen. Don't worry, there are fans and protection from the sun. It was quite comfortable (and I have trouble with anything over 80 degrees F). They have individual stations so everyone in the class gets to cook after watching Amp demonstrate a recipe. I learned to make 4 different homestyle meals (prawns were my favorite), all of which I plan to cook at home. Amp demonstrated technique and explained each step. It was fantastic! I am not one for fussy food and wasn't interested in the cooking schools offered at the hotels where you watch rather than do. If you want to learn about Thai food and culture in a low key, hands on class, Samphong Cooking School is perfect. I can't wait to go back."

Everything is well explained on the website. The usual meeting point is at a skytrain station where someone comes to pick you up.The course starts with a market visit during which you learn a lot about the different varieties of vegetables and ingredients you will cook. It is very interesting.During the course, you prepare 5 dishes. Koy is a very good teacher, she first explains clearly the recipe and then she repeats instructions where you are cooking. She is helped by an assistant (so 1 teacher by table) who checks the different stages, gives you advice and helps you if you need. You are given a booklet of recipes. Koy explains how to replace the ingredients you don't have at home.You first prepare 3 dishes, you have a break to eat, then you prepare the 2 last dishes and you eat them. If you are full, Koy puts your dishes in a doggy bag. It is a kind attention.This course is very well thought, Koy and her staff are efficient and friendly."

The class was not only a blast but very informative. Koy met us at the BTS station just as arranged. There was another couple there also. We went back to the school first to get the last member of the class before heading out to the market. Short 5-10 minute walk and we were there. Koy did a very good job of explaining ingredients for what we were making. She also made sure we could tell if they were fresh or not and explained substitutes in case we couldn't find the preferred item in our local markets. Was also a chance for my wife to pick up a few items we couldn't get back home. Then it was back to the school to start. She explained and then demonstrated what we needed to do. All the utensils/pans/etc. were clean and it seemed that every time we finished a step the utensils we were using were swapped out with clean ones. She also made sure everytime we did anything with the chili peppers we would wash our hands afterwards to ensure we didn't inadvertently rub our eyes with less than desirable side effects! We made three dishes which we then ate followed by two more. Every dish was outstanding and we also had watermelon and mango to eat too. Each of us received the recipes for what we made. Koy has a fantastic attitude toward teaching and a fun, bubbly personality. We give this class the highest recommendation if you're interested in attending a cooking class while in Bangkok. You won't be disappointed!"

We were met at the BTS station exactly on time by chef Koy--easily recognizable in her bright red apron!--exactly on time and professionally. I was worried about finding her in the busy sky train station, but shouldn't have been at all. Koy drove us in her air-conditioned car to the cooking school, where we met the rest of the class and headed out for an incredibly informative tour of a fresh market nearby. Once we got back to the school, we launched into a series of dishes to cook, each one SUPER easy to make, even for our 8-year old, and delicious! They had the perfect balance of \"prep yourself\" (ever made red chili paste with a mortar and pestle? It's harder than it looks!) with \"we did this because it would be too dangerous/tedious for you to do it\". Each student had their own stove to cook over, and we all ate what we made on our own. We made panang chicken curry, fried rice, tom yum soup, stir fried vegetables, and steamed banana cake--by the cake, we were STUFFED! My daughter, who eats virtually nothing that isn't macaroni and cheese, LOVED it and ate every bite--we will definitely do this again if we come back to Bangkok!"

This was obvious right from our visit to the local market to buy supplies for the 4 dishes and 1 dessert we would make during our 4 hour class. Koy is very articulate and her English is very good. She introduced us to the ingredients we would use and how to know when they're fresh. On return to the Cooking School we got started with preparing the first dish. Instructions were clear and Koy always asked if we had questions, she also provided individual attention when needed. We had a lot of fun doing this activity as a family and learned some new recipes . The recipes were given to us in a booklet after we had an incredible feast of our creations. Her family even helped pack up our leftovers to take away. The cost is 1000Baht/person, very good value for your money."

The class began with a trip to the nearby market we learned about the ingredients we will be cooking with that day. We then returned to the cooking school where we began to prepare the ingredients. Personally I found that it was a good combination of prep work done by the student as well as the staff there. It probably is not feasible to have the students do all the prep and cook the food within the time allotted. We then proceed to make five dishes. The first was a chicken red curry. The second was a cashew chicken stirfry. Next we made a banana fritters dessert. And finally we prepared a chicken soup and pineapple fried rice.

I was so stuffed but still managed to clean my plate because it was just that good. - It was cheaper than other more popular cooking schools listed on tripadvisor. - The facility was clean. Cons: - The website states that the price includes transportation to and from your residence (near by area.) She emailed me saying that they can't pick us up from our hotel because it was was too far. Her exact words were, \"Your hotel is far from our school about 5-10 min. by taxi.\" She reimbursed us for the cab ride there but not for the ride back. The cab fee was minimal so it wasn't a huge deal. - Out of the 6 things on the menu that day, 3 were made \"together.\" Meaning, people either took turns prepping or Koy or her staff just made it for us. Judging from the pictures posted on here and on Koy's website, this isn't always the case which makes it more upsetting as I'm sure the others paid the same price. (For example, to make the spring roll (Paw Pia Thawt), all of us in the small group cut up the ingredients and put it on one big plate. Then, people turn turns stir frying the ingredients on one wok. We brought the stir fried ingredients back to the table where we individually wrapped the spring rolls which were put on another big plate. Then Koy deep fried all the spring rolls while we stood around and watched.) Overall: I think I would've paid a bit more to actually make each dish by myself instead of having others cook a part of what I was supposed to have made."

It's 4 hours of happy group fun, brilliant for singles, couples or families and absolutely OK for any language group. Koy is a very pleasant personality with good English, but since it's all show, tell and then do yourself and the ingredients are either familiar or explained and created in process, language is of secondary importance. And you get to eat together what you've cooked, so it's a fun social event as well.My session of 9 participants was me solo, a pleasant young couple from Singapore, two happy Hong Kong girls and a Taiwanese family of four. We melded. It became one of those, \"Let's take a group photo\" events, and time passed very easily."

            "review": "Delicious Souvenier to Last a Lifetime. Koy's cooking class was a highlight of our trip to Thailand. We felt like we stepped away from being tourists to learn something authentic. Everyone in our family is an experienced cook, but we still learned so much. Koy took us to a real market, taught us about the ingredients and gave us all little baskets to carry the ingredients home. We ate what we cooked and it was one of the most delicious meals we had in Thailand. Considering how amazing all the food was in Thailand, Koy's class is the best of the best. A week after we came home, we scoured our Asian stores in Calgary to find the ingredients to make Koy's menu. As we were cooking, all of us said aloud \"chop, chop, chop\" as if Koy was supervising. We will enjoy Koy's class over and over again as we make her delicious recipes. Thank you Koy."

We were looking for schools to learn not only the thai basics but also the real way thai cooking is done and that's exactly what Somphong cooking school is all about. They dedicated all their attention and time to you in a real thai warm family environment. Very profesionnal, for the non-experienced to the want-to-be cook. We enjoyed so much that we decided to cancel our other plans to add an extra half-day. We will definitively include in our next trip to Thailand."

It was fantastic. Koy and her team made us having a wonderful time from the beginning until the end of the class. We went first to the local market and then we cooked for a couple of hours. Koy too, her time to explain everything, kids appreciated it a lot.We strongly recommend the Somphong Thai Cooking School to those who want to learn how to cook Thai foods in a very pleasant ambiance.Thank you To Koi and all of your colleagues!Details can be found at:http://www.originalthaicookingschool.com/"

The class was fun and easy and more personal. It was as if i was cooking at home, the ambiance was very comfortable. And our teacher, koy is so sweet and she really knows what she's doing. Actually the whole staff were very sweet an organized and we can tell that theyre very experienced. For only a 1000 bhat you get to learn thai cooking and eat them too after! It was an amazing experience. Would definitely go back to learn more recipes."

            "review": "A highlight of our trip!. You must make the time to visit this cooking school. They make it easy for you - we were picked up at the local train station where we were met with smiling faces. The school is actually Khan Koy's home and instantly you are made to feel at home. I was with my husband and three children (aged 13, 15 and 16) and the staff made us feel very welcome. On arrival we were offered refreshments and some Thai treats/snacks - so delicious but do not fill up as there is so much food to come! We walked to a local market where the fresh produce was purchased for our dishes. The whole time khan is informing us (in very good English) about the produce - we learnt so much. After the markets we returned to the school where we created the most amazing banquet to feast on. The flavours were unbelievable - better than any restaurant we had eaten in - ingredients so fresh, pastes made from scratch and we had created it ourselves. You are given your own recipe book containing all the dishes you created this day. On arrival back to Australia we went to our local fresh fruit and veggie market where we were able to find the fresh ingredients. A quick trip into China town and we had all the other ingredients. Khan of course tells you of substitutes you can use if you can't find the true ingredients. She instilled such a passion for Thai food that we copied the banquet on our second night back home and we prepared and cooked it very successfully - a wonderful teacher!!!! We did many truly amazing things whilst in Thailand and this is one of those. A MUST DO!!!!!!!"

Upon arrival, snacks and Thai tea were served, and I enjoyed home-brewed Thai tea a lot! The snacks were made from pineapple and tasted delicious, too. Then, we went for a market tour. It was interesting to learn about Thai's unique herbs and spices. Koy also explained the difference between coconut cream and coconut milk, which was a question in my mind for a long time. I also asked how people picked up coconut from the tree, and it was quite surprising to learn that people in Thailand actually trained monkeys to pick up coconut, LOL. All the recipes were clear and not hard to follow. All in all, I like my Thai cooking experience a lot!"

We enjoyed every moment we had spent at the cooking class. Khun Koy is very knowledgeable, passionate, generous, flexible, and she is very hands on teacher. We also enjoyed going to the fresh market, and seeing all the fresh ingredients that we brought back to the cooking class. We had such a great time at the cooking class, also Khun Koy is always with you every step during your class. We highly recommend Somphong Thai cooking class to everyone who wants to learn how to cook real authentic Thai food. I guarantee you won't be disappointed, and you will have a good time in the class, and you will definitely be full!!!!"

We made five dishes in total and Koy was very clear in explaining how to make the best dish and why certain produce is used / or what you could use as an alternative. The trip to the Market was a great start to the course to become familiar with the ingredients for using later on in the class. We'll come back again next year to try our hand at some more dishes!"

Koy is such a passionate and generous teacher, and flexible too when it was just my partner and I that attended the class. We had such a great time going to the markets for the fresh produce, and then cooking the whole morning, best part was eating till we literally rolled out the door and didn't even need dinner!To date now that we're back home in Australia, we make the green chicken curry on a regular basis, and all friends and family that gets to taste it loves it! Thank you Koy, should we ever visit Thailand again, we'll be coming for our next lesson!NB: We actually went in March 2010, but can't be back dated that far."

We left with a much better understanding of Thai cooking and a bit fatter, having eaten much of what we cooked.I got my hotel to phone up and make the booking and they wrote down in Thai the address for the taxi driver - and looked it up on Google Maps. Having done that, we found it easily.The market tour was genuinely informative and a good learning foundation for the rest of the morning.We went on a Sunday and covered the recipes listed in the menu on the website. You are given a demonstration or a dish, then cook it yourselves, from scratch. And astoundingly the results were really good! Koy is a charming and thorough teacher. She did a fabulous job.The school is homely, clean and well equipped.We both thoroughly recommend this school.Best not to eat much breakfast before you go though!"

            "review": "Half a day cooking with Koy - lessons learned for life?. I see upon myself as a very mediocre chef. But I love food, and took the chance of attending a cooking class i Bangkok, since the Thai cuisine is one of may favorite kitchens.We took an afternoon class, and it started with a tout to a close by market. Most of the market was closed that late, but our teacher Koy showed us all the ingredients we would use and how to pick out the best ones when you yourself will go shopping when cooking back home.We cooked five different dishes, and Koys English is excellent, and she gave great instructions. Not only what to use, buy why you use this or that specific spice. And what you can exclude or replace, if you have problems to find all the ingredients back home. All the instructions were given in writing upon arrival, so you could add your own notes. I left the class thinking even i could do this. My friend, she is a star in the kitchen, enjoyed the class just as much as I did. So cooking for everyone, not just for dummies as me.I've tried some Thai cooking back home after this, both from what we cooked in class and recipes I found online. The results have been great. I've received so many compliments for my cooking, from people I highly admire in the kitchen (and that is a first). On a potluck, everyone agreed my Thai dish was the best of everything served. And I must say, I thought so too. I hope to come back to Somphong Thail Cooking School one day.To think about: You don't have to bring anything. They have everything you need including refreshments. Facilities are nice, and you can leave your bags in the air-conditioned dining room. We had the first dish on the table after one and a half hour, and after that, we ate so much delicious food so I could hardly walk away from there. So arrive there hungry, but not starving."

We originally booked with another school but they must have been full and moved us over to this school which for us was fantastic. We were picked up from Chong Nonsi BTS, driven to the school and invited into the cooking/home area. It was beautifully clean with a welcoming icy cold Thai Tea to drink. Introductions were made, we were given a basket each and we set of the couple of minutes walk to the food market where all manner of things were on display.The different herbs, spices and fresh vegetables were explained in simple straight forward english and we learnt lots of things just doing that.Once finished purchasing our vegetable ingredients back to the home/school we went and the fun began.We cooked some lovely fresh, tasty dishes that we feel quite sure we can easily replicate at home. All explanations and information was simple, after cooking each dish we ate them, we were so full at the end of it I feel I may never eat again!We learnt how to make beautiful plate decorations out of tomato skins (my husband enjoyed that), we made Pandanus parcels out of leaves for our chicken (that was fun to learn).Cold bottled water was supplied, towelettes for cooling down, aprons, recipe book with pens for note taking.Likes: Food delicous, staff helpful, information easily understood, genuine people, everything metculously clean and hygenic,Dislikes: Nothing at allWe would recommend anybody for this course, we only had 5 in the class and it was fantastic. We will be back to Bangkok in September and will be doing another class.I promise you will enjoy it - Di (Kevin and Di Smith)"
