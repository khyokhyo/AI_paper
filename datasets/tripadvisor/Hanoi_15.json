Also well preserved stone and wooden engravings. Very happy we came here. Was quite impressed the art is not infused with revolutionary or war themes one would expect. Only one hall dedicated to that. Most of the art depicts people and nature. The whole tour on three floors will take you no more than 1.5 hours. If you manage to cross the street try the orange labelled coffee shop called Chat&Date."

It is a little hard to navigate but otherwise it is great. It is well lit, the explanations are in English, French and Vietnamese, and it is air conditioned. It encompasses several hundred years of art. It has a very interesting lacquer painting exhibition with good explanations. A little too much war paintings for my taste but then they have had many years of war."

In the modern day section I expected to be hit with lots of propaganda, but found much more than that. I had a glimpse into how the artists held on to their sense of what is beautiful through their nation's decades of struggle against outsiders. The one that especially drew me in is a work called \"Lantern Festival\" dated 1965 if I am not mistaken. I encourage you to see for yourself."

I then spent another hour in the museum shop and after much consideration decided to purchase a painting. The amount was agreed on and we discussed the additional cost of postage to Australia. Come time to pay the sales woman suddenly increased the price considerably. I was with my two adult children who witnessed this and were involved in the cost discussions. Sadly I didn't buy the painting and left feeling annoyed. I understand this is a common cultural experience when buying in Asia, however I did not expect this in such a setting and when the price was already considerable."

The only let down was the flow of each room was a bit inconsistent, as if it needed a major renovation of the whole building and so able to rearrange the art works.Tickets can be purchased at the front gate for a small amount of money.

Most rooms in the museum are air conditioned, though bathrooms, stairwells, and one or two other areas aren't.Second, the price is right. Entry was 30,000 VND, which was less than $1.50, and I easily spent two hours there and would have enjoyed being able to spend an hour more. I rushed through the top floor and the second building, but if I had taken my time about it, I think it could have been a very pleasant 3 hour visit.Third, the art was pretty fantastic. The ground floor, in particular, with all the ancient art, was really interesting. The middle floor had some older work and some newer work- it's a little odd, but they seem to have organized the displays almost entirely by the type of medium instead of thematically or chronologically. For instance, there's one room of works on paper, and one gallery of work using laquer, and one room with works on silk. In a given room, there may quite a range of art. I think it would be a hard place to find a particular piece, but to wander around in, it was very pleasant.Some of the signage isn't translated very well, but there is at least some English signage just about everywhere, and you get the general idea.The ground floor of the main building was mostly older art, with many religious-themed items and quite a bit of sculpture. Upstairs one level from there is mostly paintings, a few sculptural pieces but much more emphasis on 2D artwork. There was a room or two on the middle level which I would characterize as Vietnam War propaganda art, and certainly the more contemporary art on the top floor had many pieces that were clearly influenced by the war or war propaganda- the victorious or courageous soldier portrait being a common theme.Don't neglect the second building, which is off to the left of the ticket office (the main building being straight ahead). It has a basement with ceramic art and a floor of household items, including clothing and decorated or traditional objects, which was all very interesting and I would have liked to have more time to explore.There weren't very many visitors there, though I was there on a weekday morning, so maybe weekends are busier. I had the feeling the guards outnumbered us, but it was nice not to feel crowded or rushed. The place was fairly quiet. In a way, it's too bad- people are missing out!I saw several museums in Vietnam, and this was definitely the best. Great art, English signs, air conditioning, for a tiny entry price."

The museum houses quiet a large collection: paintings, sculpture, textiles and ceramics. There could be better direction given, we did get a floor plan but tended to meander all over the place. There are lots of interesting art works, especially lacquer paintings and I really wanted to understand the lacquer painting process but info was scarce. The modern art section was small but interesting with a couple of pieces interesting enough to get me onto the internet back at our hotel to find out more.

The newer collections reflects the country recent history with a high degree of propaganda running through, which is a nice antidote to the \"hollywood\" version of events. Only slight issue was the lack of a coffee shop. I would also recommend getting a taxi as its a little difficult to find and further out of the centre than the maps suggest."

It is well laid out with your visit going through the ages.Some (many) of the pieces are just superb and have an emotional impact to them and their history.

A fair-sized building in the middle if town, it has three floors, all connected by stairs at either end of the spacious building. At each side of the impressive edifice there are both genders of toilets located helpfully just by the stairways. Each of the floors has multiple fair-sized rooms connected by various walkways linking the various different parts of the adequate structure. The floor surfaces continuously unite various different parts of the exhibits wrapping around in a meandering sense.Following an eight-year absence from the onset of the great recession, I returned recently to travel throughout Vietnam and Cambodia. These Third World countries, to use the vernacular of the outdated \u201cThree Worlds\u201d model, seem to have come a long way. For a Communist dictatorship, Vietnam sure has a lot of Prada: Welcome to the Bourgeois revolution! Cambodia\u2019s present-day open market system and regime stability has led to increased investment all around; for example, Siem Reap used to be a sleepy little hovel with some awesome nearby temples, and now its streets are lined with 5-star hotels. In terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), both Vietnam and Cambodia are currently among the world\u2019s fastest-growing, pushing 7%, led by India at 8%, while the large Chinese tortoise plods at around 6%. While this is driven mainly by global integration, I would say to you now, come visit these places while they still retain a palpable measure of uniquely identifiable ancestry.

In this case the more modern artwork was heavily influenced by the various conflicts, especially with the French and the Americans. My favourite pieces were the lacquer engravings, where they started with a black surface and the cut in the design and added colour."

This museum is testimony to the repression, intellectual and artistic, that was endured during the Communist regime. It might be recommended for psychologists and academics. Not to the general public.Art galleries in various cities in Vietnam exhibit pictures by a generation of talented, creative and inspired artists. None of this energy is found in the Fine Arts Museum.

There are some early art works that indicate that there might be more fine art works hiding in the vaults in the basement.

The exhibits are arranged chronologically, beginning on the ground floor with the requisite nod to the Dong Son civilization and continuing on to more recent works on the upper floor. There\u2019s also an adjacent building with textiles and ceramics. The wall texts are largely limited to dates, locations, and media. There isn\u2019t much interpretive material provided in any language, and what has been translated into English can be incomprehensible. Despite that, visitors can still get a sense of major trends in the history of Vietnamese art. Visitors familiar with modern Western art will recognize the influence of Chagall, Picasso, and others in some paintings. The combination of European techniques and traditional materials, such as silk and lacquer, is striking. The museum lacks contemporary art, which can be found elsewhere in Hanoi at nonprofit and commercial galleries.Our taxi driver couldn\u2019t find the museum at first. It\u2019s across the street from the park containing the Temple of Literature (Van Mieu), which locals are more likely to know."

Three floors of beautiful oils, engraved lacquer and gouache works (mostly inspired by Vietnam's struggles), a few sketches and quite a few sculpted figures make this museum a must see.

Paintings look like they are full of adherent surface deposits, the colors of the lacquer paintings are faded and many of them have lost their gloss, and you can see moisture stains in many of the works on paper.

Yes, the themes are the same; however, lacquered painting is both difficult as well as a true technique requiring great skill. You see a lot of this here. Look at the characters.

We walked here from the French Quarter, so were hot and sweaty on arrival. Once inside it was a cool haven of tranquility.All of the art is Vietnamese. It covers both ancient and modern. Much of the modern focuses on the wars, but it is very beautiful - including prints, lacquer, oils and watercolours. There's a good shop too."

The upper galleries were nicely done, and we particularly enjoyed the silk paintings and some of the modern works of sculpture and art. Although the galleries are air-conditioned, several of the AC units apparently were not working, so we paused not at all in the lacquers and early 20th Century paintings. The influences of East and West, traditions, history and socialism make for a fascinating study in this museum.

The Buddhist wooden statues from the 1700s are also quite magnificent. I wasn't particularly interested in the art, and the descriptions of the pieces are lacking, but this is a good place for a stroll on a rainy day. There are three floors of exhibitions.

The gallery is also a quiet, peaceful and cool spot to visit, to take a breather from the busy world outside. The early works are vary from large sculptures and bas reliefs, to small artefacts. Then you progress through the gorgeous display of lacquer artworks. There is also an excellent section of artwork depicting the struggle for independence. My favourite section was the contemporary artwork. You can view excellent works which show French influence from the impressionist period. There are also works which show surrealist and abstractionist influences. The contemporary artworks of the 21 st century are varied . There are some excellent photo realism paintings and some wonderful works depicting modern Hanoi. The gift shop also has some great signed and numbered linocut and wood block prints for sale, by young Vietnamese artists at very reasonable prices. Thoroughly enjoyed this Museum.

Visiting the Vietnam Fine Arts Museum - just across the road from where we were yesterday - The Temple of Literature and National University - seemed like a good idea. Reflecting on the antiquity of some of the collection is sobering - a thousand and more years old. We will return as we only covered about a third of the collection in this extensive 1930s, French-built facility. The French outstayed their welcome but certainly left behind them some fine architecture.Employing media from carving and sculpture, through bronze, stone and lacquered wood to more modern materials of silk and oil painting - drawn from the French though adhering to Vietnamese and Cham expressions and styles - the collection covers influences from the early Confucian up to and beyond the Communist, patriotic depictions of the 1930s to the 1970s.Modern Westerners like us, imbued with Greek, Roman and European media and styles, will be inspired. Linking Vietnamese art to those periods viewers will see immediately the developments in thought and philosophy were often in advance of our own. Thanks Confucious and the early emperors of Vietnam.The English labels were occasionally amusing and often bemusing. I would love to get my editor's hands on them - with no disrespect. We will be going back quite soon."

Each gallery has an introduction in Vietnamese, English and French that is well-written and informative. Each piece of art is also labelled in English, which is very helpful. Many pieces of fine art from the 1930's, when French influence was strong, is truly beautiful but, alas, in need of conservation. Some paintings are fading, or the paint is flaking off. But the art shines through. Vietnam had been at war from 1945 through the 1970's, first with the French and then the Americans. So, much of the art is nationalistic in tone, some of it heavy handed, other pieces technically very good. The painting atop of this category is Hanoi Youth preparing to meet the American aggressors.\" Ok, but it's their reality. There are also very abstract and modern images, the further removed from war, the more human-centered the art."

My only criticism is that a) rooms could be numbered because you can get confused on where you've been & what's next, and b) it would make sense for the layout to have you do all the ancient stuff first so you get a sense of progression. That aside, if you like looking at beautiful things then this is a visual feast in particular for seeing how a regional art form like lacquer gets adapted to more modern subjects and how styles bridge continents, when you see echoes of Van Gogh or perhaps what inspired the Dutch master. A truly enjoyable afternoon spent out of the chill, mist & drizzle."

There is also a nice gift shop/bookstore off to the side, where you can purchase a book that covers the exhibits for 50K vnd.

So spending nearly three hours here may seem excessive to some but there is just SO much to see! The museum is located at the far end of The Temple of Literature, which attracts lots of visitors. So I am not sure why we were two of perhaps only a dozen visitors.The entrance fee is just 30,000 dong - a little under \u00a31. There is a room with lockers to leave bags. Sadly, there is no floor plan and no brochure was given to us which could lead you to the museum's highlights. But there are so many!Although billed as a fine arts museum, it actually embraces the decorative and applied arts, too. The displays are very well signed, with an explanation to each room. The curators have tried to take the visitor through a history of Vietnam in chronological order (which is why the floor plan would have been helpful as we sometimes went out of sequence). There is a collection of prehistoric artefacts, an amazing collection of carvings from over 1000 years ago, textiles, ceramics and paintings in a variety of formats and styles, eg on silk to contemporary art. So for those from London, it is like a mini Tate, National Gallery, V&A and British Museum rolled into one.There is a good quality art/book/gift shop, although it is hidden away for some reason. There were no catering facilities. The museum is over three floors and in two buildings. I did not see any lifts, so those with mobility issues may need to check access arrangements. Do go, though. You won't be disappointed!"

If you are staying near the Old Quarter it is within comfortable walking distance of the Hang Bong Road and the walk takes you through some of the most open and interesting areas of Hanoi. There are parks with beautiful gardens and some intriguing statues on the way to the Museum. If you get lost- highly unlikely - there are plenty of officials in a bewildering variety of uniforms only too pleased to help you find your destination. The art work includes reference to village life, traditional culture, revolutionary struggle and resistance to colonialism. There are surprising signs of influence by European painters such as Picasso and this helps to connect the Museum experience with the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum site's art exhibition. The larger than life sculptures are stunning and because you will encounter them early in your visit they set the tone for what is to come. The various rooms are often quite small and accessible by a broad staircase in this wonderful colonial style buidling."

Wasn't sure what to expect, but this was great and stood comparison with any art museum in the West (and for my money better than the equivalent in HCMC). Well displayed and labelled, good clear layout. Some excellent early sculpture. But the real highlights for me a room of remarkably realistic eighteenth-century lacquer Buddhist figures; lacquer paintings, something I'd not seen before; and some scorchingly powerful paintings of the revolution and war period. The shop somewhat bizarrely placed in the centre of the museum is well worth a visit."

I love art and we've visited many art exhibitions and museums on our travels, so my husband and I were looking forward to this.It's not too far to walk from old town, about 20 minutes. The entrance fee was 30K each, which was reasonable considering how much there is to see.We did enjoy it, but there are some criticisms - they don't provide a printed guide/map (even one sheet would be enough) to show you what each room contains. There is a map outside on a board, but this 1930s building has A LOT of rooms and at times was difficult to navigate - or, rather, it didn't have a good flow - and we were worried that we'd miss something.It's generally well lit (not all rooms) and some parts have air conditioning - after negotiating all those stairs it felt like a bit of a workout.The staff weren't unfriendly, but they weren't helpful either - some were doing each other's hair, and one was sleeping in the gallery! Nobody acknowledged us as we walked around, which was a shame. Might be nice if they had staff who could point you in the right direction/explain about the more important works.It took us around 2.5 hours to get round everything, but we were skipping things at the end - we almost felt like there were too many similar items on the walls.We wanted to stop at the adjoining caf\u00e9 afterwards for lunch, around 13:00, but it looked closed and had no vibe at all so we went elsewhere (Moment caf\u00e9 about 10 mins walk from museum, which was excellent). Overall a good way to spend a couple of hours, but not an enthralling experience."

There is a large selection of contemporary art. I would recommend reading up on the arts of Vietnam before coming to the gallery OR stopping in at the first gallery shop that sells original prints (approximately $200 much better than other galleries in the city), oils, some other items, and some excellent art books at incredible prices (about $25). Study them if you are interested and come back. You will not be sorry. It is a great place to learn about Vietnam and its art. The fee to get in is 30,000 dong.

Housed in a beautifully restored French colonial building, you could easily spend over two hours here (art buffs, that is). Navigating the museum is easy -- signs guide you through the exhibits. One building is dedicated to ceramic, pottery, and metalwork, while the main building has ancient to contemporary works of art. Each room has a plaque that describes the era and type of work -- you know what you're looking at in this museum.Personally, I found the pieces from the past century the most impressive. They detail Vietnam's past, its daily life, victories, tragedies, and everything in between. Entrance is 40,000VND, and you're free to take pictures throughout the museum. You can't bring bags in however: purses and backpacks are placed in lockers near the entrance."

The quality of the more modern art on the upper floors is mixed but nonetheless interesting. The adoption of Western painting styles is evident but so is the persistence of Vietnamese techniques and motifs. There are some beautiful, intricate, etched lacquer works. Scattered through the galleries is some very nice bronze sculptures.A separate wing houses applied and decorative art works. Best of this is a newly refurbished ceramics gallery in the basement.

Bit it focuses primarily on 20th century art that resulted after the establishment of the first fine arts school under French colonialism. There are many gorgeous lacquer paintings and paintings on silk, very much in a Vietnamese style. The topics of the modern pieces are village life or the fight for independence; there is next to no abstraction or unique innovation in the works, but the museum does a good job in presenting its holdings."

The museum features ancient as well as modern Vietnamese art and it's quite a treat to see the two! I particularly enjoyed the modern paintings, depicting the war and daily life in Vietnam. The paintings are not abstract, they all tell an obvious story and I find that refreshing in 20th century art. It's just $1 entry, so go have a wander for a few hours!"

There is a LOT here, because the good collection of the historic carvings and statues to rooms and rooms of painting, silk painting, lacquer works etc. Yes, some of the standard revolutionary approaches and hymns to independence, but that's what the country is about and it is important to recognize the passion behind the positions. Not strong on explanation, but just amble and ramble and you will absorb a lot. Bracket it with the ethnography/history museums and a visit to contemporary galleries (such as Suzanne Lecht) and you will have a good grasp of the artistic whole."

At the end we discovered the wing where we were pretty much alone. One floor was all adornment from hill cultures - clothes, weaving a baskets and more. Then we discovered to our delight that they were setting up for a show of contemporary artists and we were invited in. What an opportunity; met some of them too. From Malaysia, America, Vietnam, and maybe someplace else. Great show. We breezed through the ancient stuff having finally run out of steam. Took a break midway at their cafe - the matchbox. Highly recommend the black sticky rice with yogurt. Yum!"

I was really impressed, not only by how gorgeous much of the art was, but also how unusual and unique to Vietnam. There were many images combining imagery of both war and nature. A few soldiers crossing a small footbridge in a huge steamy green jungle, for example. Another popular theme was the inclusion of modern elements in what seems at first to be a very traditional painting. Village scenes scattered with communist flags. Fishermen casting nets with freighters and smokestacks in the background. I especially loved the lacquer engraving and lacquer painting in the main building. The use of color and composition by Vietnamese artists is spectacular. It reminded me a lot of Klee, one of my favorite artists.I would have to agree with some of the reviewers who commented on what a shame it was that the building itself is probably not very kind to the art. It didn't appear to be very well climate- or humidity-controlled. Also, the official policy is no photos at all, without the museum director's express consent. I really wish they at least allowed photos without flash. There was so much art I loved and would like to remember. They didn't seem to be enforcing the policy very strongly though, so if you have a camera with a discreet setting, you should be able to quietly sneak in a few shots.There is a cafe on the premises, but I didn't get a chance to check it out. Also free lockers next to the ticket window. Tickets 20,000 dong. Quite a bargain! I might go back to check out their applied art exhibit since I didn't have time to view that. Which reminds me...they started kicking people out as early as 4:45pm, even though closing time is supposed to be 5pm."

I have been a couple of times, although I usually leave feeling a bit of pique. Once, during an exhibition by modern artist Hoang Dinh, I was rewarded with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, both rare and humbling, to meet the artist and his beautiful wife. I am still in awe. Not only of their gentle hospitality, but of the work itself - breathtakingly beautiful explosions of color and meaning with a very Vietnamese soul. But, I am very sorry to say, the Museum otherwise is a ramshackle. The light bulbs that aren't blown are sputtering and on the brink of extinction. Excruciatingly rare and beautiful national treasures are crumbling from exposure. There is precious little in the way of explanatory notes in English or other languages to identify epic pieces - although what narrative is provided is excellent. I admit I am spoiled by Museums in the West, like the Smithsonian. I can understand the enormous pride that must lie behind such an exquisite collection but I feel only sad at what is wasting away from neglect. I wouldn't complain except I think that maybe an outcry from the public might shake the government to provide the necessary resources to do this institution some justice. Both times I visited the air conditioning was on the fritz (no worry for me, only the art work), the exhibition rooms were filled with the cigarette smoke of bored security guards, and staff spoke loudly on cell phones, oblivious to the hallowed nature of what was on offer. For all that - I will go again. I will take visitors. I urge other visitors to go to. It is an important place. It just needs some help."

We walked through the whole museum from start to finish and didn't get bored at all. The information cards in English are very informative and helpful in enhancing appreciation of the art and artifacts. The galleries are arranged chronologically, which we found really helpful for grasping the history of fine arts in Veitnam. Definitely recommended."

The first impression is of a rather small and darkish place, and after paying for a ticket (about 60 Euro cent!) one perhaps doens't expect all that much. Some of the exhibits on the ground floor where one starts are also not too well labelled, giving the impression that this is a typical third-world museum that's poorly maintained. Not true, though.It quickly gets better, and the museum has a rather impressive collection. Some nice sculptures from the last 2000 or so years, and followed by a comprehensive collection of paintings. There are some very distinct schools: traditional/pre-war, many paintings and installations dating from or after the 1960/70 Vietnam war, strongly socialist-inspired work, and more recent/contemporary art. Overall not a huge, but well selected set of works that oen can see in about an hour. Well worth it.There is also a bookshop wiht a well-chosen collection of books on art, with a focus on Vietnamese art. The manager is the wife of an artist herself, and very knowledgeable herself (with pretty good English). There is also a lot of original art on sale - teh best collection I was able to find in Hanoi, where \"copy shops\" abound, and where finding original work is very hard. Prices are moderate to a bit high, starting at 100 US$ for smaller pieces, and with larger oil- or laquer works going for 500+ $. Not cheap, but then they are original pieces.Overall, a defintie recommendation for anyone who likes fine art, or is interested in purchasing a painting or drawing."

After a while though, we got bored and were hoping to see more modern art. I don't know if it's just not there or if it doesn't exist as one floor was closed for renovation. This probably represents about 1/8th of the whole gallery, so we didn't see as much modern art as we would have liked. If you're really into art, you'll probably enjoy it. If you have a more mild interest, then maybe it's worth skipping if there are other attractions you want to fit in. Might rather be worth hitting some of the fancier galleries for more modern art."

            "review": "Very National, indeed. Previous reviewers have not always emphasized that this is really the National Fine Arts Museum of Hanoi, and that only Vietnamese Art is on display. The upper floor is largely devoted to ancient art, mainly in the form of statues of Buddha and other Buddhist themes, as well as some impressively colorful silk tapestries.The ground floor holds a large collection of paintings, drawings and photographs, as well as a number of relatively modern sculptures in stone and wood that reveal commendable technical skill and occasional artistic vision. The most interesting rooms exhibit paintings and drawings from the time of the Vietnam War to the present. Initially, one is struck but not surprised that they start off as pure propaganda vilifying the Americans and glorifying the communist state in a grotesque imagery borrowed from Stalinist and Fascist Art. Whatever colors the artist may have used, everything comes across metaphorically as black or white. The art of the post-war period is more lyrical and even poetic at times; the subject matter is ordinary people going about their business of restoring normality to the battered country, or conventional landscapes of the countryside. But since the beginning of the new Millenium, propaganda and social realism have taken a back seat. The influence of cubism and abstract expressionism shows in many of the best works, and it would be hard to recognize their provenance. This suggests that \" Bourgeois Formalism\", the biggest sin an artist could commit in the Eastern Europe of the 1950s to '80s, doesn't trouble the current Vietnamese Communist Party, and that control of ideological thought and expression has regressed from that of Orwell's 1984 back to a more normal liberal framework. You could say that on the time frame of the avant gard chronometer, Hanoi has reached about 1960 Greenwich Village Time. There will still be a few decades before their artists try to pass off elephant dung and dirty beds as works of creative art."

Located near the Temple of Literature (Van Mieu), so easy to combine with the usual city high-point visits. Vietnamese oils from the 1920s to the later 20th century are a revelation, and the collection of ancient sculpture is also very fine. The moving works of 20th century war art are particularly compelling. It's quite a go-ahead place with a children's activity centre and periodic exhibitions: I do strongly recommend a visit."

Nowadays, there is an other kind of painting made from the very popular class of people, the embroidery painting. This is not only a place you can find the works of almost all the famous painter of Vietnam, but you can also understand and across the evolution of the society and the daily life of vietnamese people, through art and age of picture.

In some of the rooms, there was a large focus on war related material that may or may not be to your liking. For us, we tended to go faster through these rooms and enjoyed the buddhas and other historical pieces. It's worth a visit and is a nice place to relax from the busy Hanoi streets.TIP: This is very close to the Temple of Literature so we visited both when on that side of town.

In the second building the third floor has a large beautiful ethnology display, not to miss, and the first two floors houses traveling exhibits and the basement has ceramics. Since the museum was started in the 1960\u2019s the bulk of the newer work is from the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. The museum has created a visual adventure into early art of Vietnam, and a look into in to the changes of the country in the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s. My greatest disappointment is the lack of Vietnamese art of the 1800\u2019s and early 1900\u2019s and they seem not to be collecting, at present, the wonderful contemporary art of the country. There are so many wonderful artists in Vietnam; they need to be shown in their museum. With all that said, I strongly recommend a visit to this unique art museum."

This is a museum not only about art but also a window into Vietnamese culture and the impact of centuries of war. There are some wonderful exhibits - the Buddhist statues are fascinating, particularly those of the Buddha himself which show him as emaciated rather than fat and jolly. As I looked at these statues I felt like this must have been how Buddha actually looked; and many of the other figures looked individual as well. The lighting is poor and the building shabby but there are still artworks that would hold up in any museum. Also fascinating were how many of the paintings and sculptures referred to war. This is a country that has been invaded many times, by many different armies, over many different time periods. A lovely statue with a classical feel is holding a rifle...this juxtaposition is seen in many works. And if you like to shop, the small store of the museum has some of the best things to buy that we saw on our tour of the country. Many folks told us, 'if you see something, buy it.\" you may not see it again and we were glad we listened to that advice. The museum is definitely worth a visit as much for its window on the culture as anything else."

We were pleasantly surprised at this museum, which is far better than equivalent institutions in Delhi and Beijing in providing consistently attractive displays and detailed, English-language explanations of the works on display. The ground-floor galleries are a must-visit, with encyclopedic coverage of Vietnam's cultural history and its distinct regional identities. Several major wood carvings were a real joy, and merited far more time than the hour or so we had before the building closed. The middle floor also had some treasures in store, particularly the lacquer paintings from the early 20th century. One monumental set of screens is truly memorable, unexpectedly rich not only in color but in design and artistic insight. But it's also on the second floor that the propaganda starts to seep in, not unexpectedly given Vietnam's 20th-century experience. On the third floor it becomes relentless. Brilliant technique is no help to an aesthetic language that ranges from the bombastic (the inevitable shot-down planes) to the insipid (Norman Rockwell-in-Hanoi images for the Jane Fonda set at their most witless). Our big regret is that we were not able to get to the adjoining building housing craft exhibits, or to see any contemporary galleries, which I hope would show the arts growing past their Uncle Ho-era stridency. But the bottom line: highly recommended, with managed expectations."

            "review": "Not essential. Located in a remarkable 1930ies building, the Fine Arts Museum has three floors. Ground floor offers a limited number of interesting sculptures from 10th to 19th centuries as well as a small collection of archeological artifacts. Particularly impressive are Buddhist deities such as the huge \"One Thousand Eye, One Thousand Arm Guan Yin\" statue. However some of the lacquered statues seem to have been so poorly \"restored\" - maybe with acrylic paint (you can even spot dried paint drops on faces) - that it spoils the pleasure of admiring them. The first and second floors display modern and contemporary paintings and a few sculptures. At least every second one represents armed soldiers or military tanks. I agree that \"fine arts\" is a matter of subjectivity, but honestly some artworks in these two floors are of questionable artistic value and appear out of place in a museum of fine arts. They would better be placed in the nearby Army Museum. In summary, if you are used to visiting fine arts museums around the world, the Fine Arts Museum of Hanoi might disappoint you, even when the admission fee is almost symbolic (20'000 dongs or 1 US$) . Has restrooms. Restaurant on premisses."

            "review": "An excellent museum. We visited the Fine Arts Museum a few years ago. In my travel log, I wrote that the couple of hours we'd spent there hadn't been enough, so next trip we're planning to spend an entire morning or afternoon. It offers a fascinating spectrum of Vietnamese art, from ancient to very modern. In many parts, the displays and lighting are on a par with modern western galleries and museums. Probably not suitable if you're only going to Vietnam for cheap beer, Ha Long Bay and cheap Ts :-)"

Gift shop has things that you can find elsewhere in Hanoi. Pretty building, but certainly not a must-see."
