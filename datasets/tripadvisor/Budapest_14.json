There is very little aircon so warm! Our first seats were towards the front on the ground level. Great view, aucoustic very good. The second concert we were in a box. Beware when booking, it is not clear on the website what they are and what the view is. They look like row on a higher level but they are in a box. Go for the front row because the seats in the second row are on the same level. They are small seats and it is 8 seats per box, 4 front, 4 behind. The aucoustic was excellent and we were lucky enough to get front row tickets.Dress up, all the locals do. There is a lovely bar/ snack area for the break. It is reasonably priced."

A wonderful surprise--it was a ballet. The opera house is beautiful, small and intimate. Bar service during breaks. Seats on the floor are great. The boxes down close on either side appeared that people had to lean out to see parts of the performance on either far side of the stage. Great experience; recommend giving it a try."

Once inside the Opera House, visitors have the opportunity to either take part in the tours of this beautiful setting; to watch a short operatic performance or you can buy tickets to one of the ballet or opera performances showing at night. Even if you cannot watch one of the shows, I would recommend taking the tour in order to experience for yourself the grand staircases and the numerous chandeliers that spring from the ceilings. You must visit this magnificent building and gape in awe at the wonderful artistic architecture."

It is a replica of the Vienna Opera House but on a smaller scale. It has splendid decorations in gold finish. There are several guided tours in different languages of around 50 minutes. We enjoyed every minute of this tour with full explanations of this magnificent building. While on our tour we were surprised to listen to one of the sopranos singing with his majestic and loud voice. We recommend a visit to this Opera House and if you have a chance attend to one of the operas being held on a daily basis."

Unfortunately I got quite lost on the way and didn't arrive as early as I wanted. So after an hour (GPS map issues) of waking in the rain I couldn't get a ticket. They had sold out. I tried to reserve a spot for one of the next days tours and they wouldn't sell them ahead of time. I decided not to make the trip to that part of town again without a guaranteed spot on the tour. I love seeing old Opera houses, it's one of my go to sights in any European city, and I am disappointed to miss out on this one."

There are a lot of visitors divided into multiple language groups, but they have alternative paths. I just didn't get the way how the English group was split into subgroups. I think it's a bit too expensive anyway. You can take extra mini concert, but it's only two songs on the staircase - good option if you love opera or never heard it live, otherwise save your money or just go for a regular play."

I had emailed the box office to enquire about a performance but never got a reply, which was disappointing.Last weekend's offerings were Billy Elliot in Hungarian, or La Traviata, which we'd just seen in Vienna. Thus we opted for the guided tour. These are held at 3 & 4pm and take just under an hour. The building is beautiful, a national treasure. On our way round we met a group of primary aged children who seemed to be on an introduction to opera event. The man in charge of the group who was very close-by suddenly started singing, and I have never heard such a rich and powerful sound coming from one individual. I can only imagine the impression it made on the children- truly memorable.The guided tour finished with a soprano singing two well known arias quite beautifully. Again, you are only a few metres away from the performer, and eventhough it's only two songs, it's still a real treat.The State Opera is a splendid venue and we will enjoy a performance on our next visit."

The opera I attended was well sung with an excellent orchestra. The chairs in the box seats were a bit uncomfortable, and the lack of air conditioning at the end of June (the end of their season) didn't help. The opera was staged in a very modern mode - even with an English translation (and this was an opera being sung in English) - it was a bit hard to follow the plot (being so different from what I had expected). The ticket prices were quite inexpensive compared to other major opera houses, and I was pleased to see an audience of a wide age range. Opera in Hungary is youthful and (at least in this production) daring."

The theatre is decorated like an usual opera theatre of those times. A lot of gold, mixture of classicism and baroque. What's the main, key ingredient of any good opera house? Yes, it's the acoustics... I expected to experience again those emotions, that shiver, those goosebumps that I had with the first accords of an ouverture to Verdi's \"Aida\" in LaScala. There was a hurricane wind from an orchestra and singers playing, the music and the word were in each cell of my body. As for the Hungarian opera house, the first what I felt was lacking the air. It was stuffy. When the music started I realized that it sounded so muffled, unfortunately. It didn't flow, it stayed somewhere around a scene. Voices of singers were squeezed out... Our places were in a box. So, I don't complain because of bad location. How it could be the 3rd best theatre in terms of acoustics in the whole Europe I don't know... Nevertheless it was nice to visit this place and to touch the history."

We left our coats as requested, even though I never leave my coat in operas and theatres nornally. My bf had a small backpack with laptop and camera in it. They didn't let us in with it without explaining the reason. They had no indication of the size of bags alowed or not, they simply rudely told us they wouldn't let us in without leaving all the valuables. When asked about the reason, the only explanation we were given was: \"this is opera\".

My only complaint is that you have to pay extra to take pictures (we didn't pay) plus pay extra for a mini concert (which we paid) well you can take pictures even if you don't pay. Also you you can watch the mini concert even if you don't pay. No one checks you out."

The price was right. We had seen two productions at the Vienna Opera House and wanted to compare the venues. The Hungarian State Opera House is smaller than the Vienna Opera House. I could not compare productions because they were different types of productions. I can say we left both of the Vienna productions at intermission. I am not an opera officionado. So I cannot critique the opera. I can say I enjoyed it. We expected to leave at intermission but stayed for the whole production because we liked it so much. It was a little disappointing that our tickets precluded us from entering via the main hall. We were told to go to a side door and go up three flights of stairs. There was no way to come down through the main hall either. This was a minor disappointment. All in all a mighty fine evening."

The Opera House is an amazing venue and is worth seeing but the current way of doing the tours left us feeling dissapointed. My suggestions...1. Limit the size of the groups. 2. Run tours all day so that there isn't a whole lot of people being rushed around at the same time. 3. Charge a little more so you can care for all your visitors with more care and attention. 4. Hold a proper concert in the main part of the Opera House every day. It doesn't have to be long but I would have loved to have sat in the seats in the Opera House and listened to the very talented singer perform. It was disrespectful to her and us to be in the stairwell. The young people running the tours did their absolute best but they too deserve better. Time for a new approach! "

Did not pay for the solo performance at the end --- our timing was such that we could see and hear her from our tour!"

Nice to see from outside, of course, but you definitely should go inside to see the real beauty. I argued with my husband like \"I don't wanna pay a ticket to see an opera house like one in my own home town\". I entered after him still arguing, and in the moment I stoped talking and opened my mouth. I have never seen such beautiful and colorful lobby with marble staircases and golden wall ornaments. A big big surprise. You are not obligated to pay a ticket if you are not going at the show. You can enter a lobby for free. We couldn't enter main hall because of the show. From the inside you can imagine royal carriages coming on a social event century back. I felt like I entered in a time machine."

We were in a business group so a pre-arranged opera performance on the grand staircase where the 2 performers (a male & female) sang so beautifully well. Both solos and duet. and they have Venetian mask...adds on the mystery! I personally not an opera fan, but these few songs give me fond lasting memories of this opera house!"

The actual auditorium itself, alone, is a very impressive place, with lots of gold, with red velvet-covered seating... albeit that seating is a little cramped and not too comfortable. The Presidents Suite is on the first floor looking directly at the stage providing the President and his guests with perfect viewing of a performance. Our tour included access to this small suite, but with strict instructions that we were not permitted to sit in his special chair.There are a number of supporting rooms, meeting rooms,etc., within the opera house complex, and they are all spectacular, with expensive woodwork, ceilings etc. I would suggest an official tour of the complex because that provides you access to some areas of the Opera House not normally accessible to the general public walking in off the street.Well woth a visit for an hour or so, if you can spare the time."

We turned up for the 3pm tour to find the lobby packed with Viking tour groups. We were very surprised to see that the tour tickets did not include the \"mini-concert\" advertised in the guidebook - this costs extra - and it costs extra for a pass to take photos! The tickets were cheaper than what one would pay in England, however they were expensive relative to other Budapest attractions. I got a student ticket which was still quite dear.At the time of our English tour, there were tours for 5 other languages also. In total there were around 200 people being toured at the same time. The English group had to be split into 2 groups as there were about 70 of us. This was poor planning on their part - why did they let in that many people if they could not handle it?The tour began 10 minutes late. In every room we visited, there was at least one other tour group so it was almost impossible to hear what the tour guide was saying.The guide herself was excellent however and very fluent in English, using English sayings and making jokes throughout the tour so she was clearly well trained.Unfortunately, we had to leave the tour early because it was unbearably hot in the building. It was 30+ degrees Celcius outside, and the sheer number of people in the building meant it was even hotter inside despite the stone walls and floors. Shortly after we left, however, we saw the rest of the tour group leaving so the tour was only around half an hour long."

From here we had ample chance to soak up the atmosphere, admire the beautiful building, and enjoy the performance.

The interesting fact is that in these days of international stars, Budapest opera mostly features local Hungarian talent without famous opera divas and gents and offers a glimpse into a rich cultural musical tradition. Without fail, performances of Mozart, Verdi and Puccini were first rate while featuring young and up-coming performers.The very building and stage transports you into another time, not unlike the Vienna State Opera except that the Hungarian Opera in spite of its ornate architecture is still a smaller more modest version of the Vienese beauty. In addition, the Andrassy neighborhood where the opera house is located is a marvelous piece of local architectural and cultural history with many wonderful restaurants ad coffee shops or just places to go for an after dinner, or after performance aperitif and an obligatory Hungarian delicious dolci.I loved walking in the Opera house neighborhood on the Pest Side of this beautiful city by the Danube, Budapest, Hungary."

At the end we got to experience how the acoustic works with an encore presentation by a great soprano. That was really amazing.

This museum-like opera house opened in 1884\u2014the year after NY\u2019s Brooklyn Bridge and 35 years after Chain Bridge\u2014the gilded glory era. It\u2019s been restored and most of the fixtures are original. There are continual tours grouped by language, which gather on the grand staircases. The tour moves through ante-rooms into the grand hall. I entered an upper-level loge, stage left. Spectacular chandeliers grace the ceiling, and the 1,200 (compared to Vienna\u2019s 2,000) wooden seats are the originals, from 1884, though the red velvet has been replaced a number of times. There are five levels of seating/boxes, and the floor has metal grates for heat or ventilation under each seat.Although the complete tour package is expensive for the limited time allowed, that includes a mini-opera at the end. The diva in the accompanying photo performed two arias. Wow, what a voice! And no microphone or amplification. There\u2019s an additional charge to take pix, but unless using advanced photographic equipment the photos in low lighting are poor quality, as evidenced by my accompanying pathetic attempts. I highly recommend a tour of this phenomenal edifice. Travel in time to the gilded era of grandness, something that is rarely found in the States."

There is an option to take in a mini concert at the end of the tour for an additional charge, but we did not do this as we just wanted to see the Opera House. The Opera House is beautiful and the tour guide was excellent, offering to answer questions on each part of the building we toured and was at a good pace. We toured the auditorium, the royal box and the tour guide was informative without being overloaded and kept my attention for the whole tour.

We came out from the tour and saw a whole crowd of people sitting on the stairs, and we were guided to join them. An opera singer came out to the bottom of the stairs, sang two partial pieces, bowed and left. The acoustics were horrible and literally painful to the ear, so I was glad it didn't last long.

The tour did not start on time. The group was far too large and had to be divided. Thus, there were at least four large groups being moved from one location to another like a herd of cattle. I found it extremely difficult to listen because of the noise from other guides yelling to their groups. It became almost impossible to discern what was being said. Also, plenty of people without the red wrist band were taking pictures without penalty. Instead of letting us sit in the theater and listen to one of the opera singers perform, we were herded to a large staircase and told to sit on the floor! The opera singer was good but by this point I was too disgusted by this waste of time and money. It appeared the tours were hindered because of rehearsals.

Undoubtedly the one in Vienna was bigger, but decorations of this opera house seemed more appealing to me. Some of the wooden artefacts were nicely made, while the main opera hall was a nice place to stay in.We went for an opera house tour which cost \u00a35 for students on its own. May need to buy a photo pass and a mini concert ticket separately. Just buy tickets before the tour in the opera house and will be fine."

The Building is absolutely glorious inside and so worth the 45 minutes of your time. A highlight is getting to stand inside the Royal Box, and enjoy the prime view! As a classical musician, let me just add that this House had some real heavy weights in the Classical World as both conductors and performers. It's much more than just a beautiful building.And as for having to pay for photos, although not the norm in some countries, it's certainly not all that unusual either. It's really not that much in either dollars or euros, certainly not in pounds, for your personal memories long after you've left. I'm so glad I paid. Go and enjoy!"

They were able to organize this in no time.

Also a few things to be aware of: Yes, the seats in the top section are inexpensive, but you are literally sent in through the \"servant's entrance\" (yes, that's what the usher called it) and you have a very long climb ahead of you (no elevator that we could find), completely separate lounge area during the intermission, bathrooms, coat check, etc. Also: be prepared to pay to check your coat. Even if you're wearing it, they make you check it before you can enter the theatre. Still, even with that added cost, it was a less expensive way to see the building than paying for a tour, so it all depends on your ability to climb four flights of stairs and deal with uncomfortable seats! Overall, we enjoyed the performance, but I wish we'd known some of this ahead of time."

We paid extra to be on the ground floor since most of the cheap seats have limited or no view of the stage (fine for an opera though), but it was still very affordable compared to other Opera Houses. Definitely worth walking around and checking out the lobby, etc. during intermission. It was all so beautiful. Coat check is mandatory but pretty cheap. Some people were dressed very nicely and others a bit more casual. I definitely felt more comfortable being a bit dressed up though."

Our guide, Barbara, said Franz Joseph only visited this opera house once, because although Vienna's opera house was bigger, this one was more beautiful, and you can't go showing up Vienna. The guide was very informative on the tour, but we didn't get a look back stage. However, we did get to enter the emperor's box and have a view from the absolutely best seats. Pay the extra fee to take photos. I am a little undecided about the extra mini concert that you can purchase for an extra fee. Although the singer was excellent, he only sang two arias and they were not performed in the auditorium, but rather on the main staircase. Getting up after sitting on those tiny stairs was not easy."

I am trying to remember a worse tour anywhere and I cannot. At $25 all in it is just mediocre. However I then went to the final dress rehearsal and for $10-20 you can see everything and the performance. And you can take photos and not have to sit in the stairwell.

The Hungarian State Opera House functions in a classical, 19th century building created in the mid-19th century exactly for this purpose. It is located in the central area of Pest, on a major thoroughfare and easy to reach by public transportation. Parking in the vicinity can be complicated, so better take a cab. The resident company is simply outstanding! The voices, the choreography, the sets, are all outstanding. As opposed to many US opera companies that barely present 7-8 operas per season, The Hungarian State Opera usually lists between 15 and 20 operas per season. And, it is not the only opera in town: there are two other places where you can enjoy opera in Budapest. The building itself is beautiful, inside and out. The performances compare very favorably to most European Opera companies, especially Vienna, Berlin, Paris, Milan and London. In addition, the tickets are much less expensive as in Western Europe or the US. Please note, you are more likely to see operas that are seldom or never performed in the West for a group of illustrious opera composers from central and Eastern Europe."

It was a very enjoyable two hours of high quality ballet and received rapturous applause at the end. Generally the tickets for performances of all kinds of things seemed considerably lower that in the UK. It seemed strange to be attending this kind of event in the morning but it worked.

We went to the opera house (as a last minute purchase) to watch the ballet (Oneygin....it's an excellent production).The opera house is a stunning building, internally and externally. Facilities inside are modern, and prices, for top quality alcohol at least, are relatively high, but not out of kilter with other similar opera houses around the world (as is the atmosphere...it's a mixture of serious fans and blatant tourists so there is a degree of tension between the two).As our purchase was last minute we purchased tickets on the top tier which has a restricted view (left side, row one, seats 9-14): you lose about a third of the stage but are comparatively close for the bits you can see vis a vis some of the other seats. Thankfully there is a wide screen TV close to the restricted view areas so you can view the part of the stage you can't see. Let me say this: these seats are cheap. Seriously cheap...\u00a34.50 per person, so for the prices it's an excellent experience (if you're seeing the ballet just for the music alone!) so you egg what you pay for. That being said the seats overall even in the stalls aren't expensive: we worked out the most expensive seats are around \u00a350-\u00a360 per person (applying a liberal conversion rate) so approximately half the price of similar tickets at the ENO or similar, so it's worth getting some better seats if you are able. Tickets are easy to buy online and you print in advance. Word of warning though....if you buy the cheap seats you've got to walk up several flights of stairs to get to where you need to....not for the unfit or faint of heart!"

My friend and I really wanted to see an opera at the Hungarian State Opera House, so we booked opera tickets online as soon as we had our dates in Budapest confirmed. We ended up staying right across the street from the Opera House, which was amazing. The inside is stunning and absolutely worth seeing a show.. We even bought champagne to take in with us (turns out you can't take it all the way to your seats, FYI). We ended up sitting next to a local who filled us in on all kinds of details about the history theater that we didn't know.During the intermission, theatergoers can trickle out onto the balcony. We went in June so it was gorgeous outside."

Do you find that all of the main sights are full of tourists while the Hungarians are elsewhere? Then you haven't been to the Hungarian Opera.To start, we are in Central Europe -- the Austria-Hungarian Empire -- and the opera is important. This Opera House is not exception, and is a beautiful example of late-nineteenth splendor. If you don't want to attend a performance there is a tour of the building. But why would you not attend a performance?The musicianship and performance craft is excellent. This is Hungary, after-all, and this is important. If you enjoy the opera you will enjoy this, and if you don't enjoy the opera, please realize that if you must see an opera Budapest is one of the better places to see classical opera in the world.For the experience: This is Central Europe after-all, and attending the opera is important. Black tie. Something to look forward to. Dinner. Drinks. It's an event. The audience will be mostly Hungarian, with some other assemblage of diplomats and music-lovers, and relatively few ordinary tourists. And finally, a huge shout-out to the most professional ushering staff I've seen in a while. I took my 88 year-old father, who has arthritis, and got a high box. The ticket-taker called her colleague, who took us to another colleague who had a key-card to the backstage elevator, and who took us up to our floor, and who brought us back out to the public areas. Then, at the end, an usher came and got us, whipped us to the elevator, and straight down to the carriage-entrance. Thank you!Opera-love or not, this is a very special place."

The best tickets only cost \u00a345 each and the confirmation was emailed straight back to me and I was able to print the tickets at home. Perfect start! The building is stunning from the outside and even more stunning inside. I would advise arriving 30 mins before your performance to have a walk around and take some photos or enjoy a drink. There is a fantastic bar and the doors open out onto a terrace with great views all along Andrassy Ave. We ordered our drinks for the interval and the lovely girl on the bar pointed over to a small table and said that's where they would be. When we returned there was a \"Reserved\" sign on the table by the window with 2 chairs and our drinks with name. Couldn't have asked for more. The ballet gala was a full house; the atmosphere was fantastic; the dancers were world class, for example we watched Yonah Acosta one of the Principal male dances from the English National Ballet dance with First Soloist Yuhui Choe from the Royal Ballet along with lead dancers from the Hungarian National ballet, Mikhailovsky Theatre and Norwegian National Ballet. It was a prefect evening in every sense and we will definitely return to Budapest and to the Opera House,"

The tour guide, Emma was lovely and very knowledgable, but we came out feeling we had wasted the large entrance fee.

In terms of architecture and acoustics it is known as one of the finest in Europe, whereas the performances are usually highly appreciated by the enthusiastic public. Although I prefer Puccini's La Boh\u00e8me, the last time I enjoyed Wagner's Die Walk\u00fcre not in the last place because of its innovative visualisation. Unfortunately, the usual after opera soup\u00e9r in the neighbouring Art Deco style Callas Restaurant didn't go on because it was closed due to a private party."

However, Tuesday 15th March was a national holiday and, despite assurances from the tourist infopoint, all the museums I tried to visit were shut (plus it was freezing cold and raining). Thankfully, the Opera House was open and offering guided tours. It really is a most elegant building and the 45-minute tour - which is available in a variety of languages - is conducted by very pleasant, knowledgeable, staff. You'll get to see just about everything, except backstage, but including the main auditorium and the royal box (DON'T sit in the King's Chair, please). Even if, like me, you're not an opera fan, the history, architecture and atmosphere of the place are all interesting and the guides offer fascinating insights and anecdotes. There's an optional mini concert (at additional cost) for those who wish and unrestricted photography is permitted if you buy a wristband (though this didn't seem to be being strictly enforced on my visit). In addition, there's a well-stocked gift shop plus the elegant Opera Cafe, where I indulged myself with a cafe lungo and a Tonkabab Mousse (essentially chocolate and tastes divine!) for the sum of 1,797 Ft (6.4 2 Euros) and had a pleasant chat with a waiter who spoke excellent English, having worked on cruise liners.

We were on our way to the PUBLIN IRISH PUB on Andrassy utca and this building is the most eyecatching building that you pass on a street with some amazing architecture. Known previously as Hungarian Royal Opera House the building looks elegant and is in an area packed with bar's, pub's and restaurant's. Viewed at night the Opera House looks fantastic when illuminated. A great landmark building and well worth a visit."

You can't take your coat into the auditorium so you need to check this in to the cloakroom. The drinks in the bar are very good value at approx \u00a32 each.

The Hungarian State Opera House tours don't happen many times throughout the day or week, but they are definitely something you need to plan ahead and make time for. This building is beautiful and ornate inside and out.When you book your tour, you have an option of a tour including an opera performance at the end, or one without. We did this very last minute, so our tour didn't have an opera performance, but the tour alone was well worth the cost of admission. Make sure to let the ticket people know if you want to take pictures, because it costs extra to take pictures, and you will need a wristband so that the tour guide and workers know you are allowed to take photos.The Opera House is one of the buildings in Budapest that wasn't extensively damaged during World War II, so a lot of what you see is either restored or somewhat original to when the building was originally built. It is spectacular both inside and out. You could walk through dozens of times and always see something new. The history of the building is pretty crazy, too, which you will learn about during the tour. You can also hear about Madonna being a diva in the royal box. Some people might tell you to pass on this tour, but if you love art, architecture and history and truly want to learn more about Budapest and the history of Hungary, this is a must-do. It's a great way to spend an hour, and you'll see things you can't see anywhere else in the world."

The seats would have been perfect but we ended up sitting behind a couple that had neck twitches and kept moving their heads. So maybe spend that bit extra and get a booth that's a little bit higher up. The building itself is beautiful, they also have a cloak room, 200 Ft. There were 2 intermissions each one lasts 30 mins. We couldn't find the bar at the first intermission but found it at the 2nd one. Just save yourself time and ask someone. The drinks were pretty pricey and they also served small pastries. The show did have subtitles and it doesn't distract you from the performance too much. The actors and actresses were all great too, they all had great voices. The show ended at 9.45pm which is pretty late if you haven't had dinner beforehand. There is a resturant outside to the immediate right if you do want to grab a bite after, but again very pricey."

I was actually surprised by how quiet the upper tier was, however I guess it was so cheap a lot of couples were opting for boxes. Although not advertised the subtitles were in English as well as Hungarian (not that it matters greatly as the plot is fairly obvious in most cases!). The lead performers blew me away with the quality and shear volume of their voices and with two breaks it was an easily manageable time period (shorter than some films) despite opera's reputation for being epic. When the main theme surfaced for the first time it sent a shiver down my spine and gave me goose bumps. Building is also very spectacular and worth the ticket price alone (albeit not quite as good as Vienna).Make sure you bring change for the cloakroom as they don't like letting people in with bags and dress smart."

The singing at the end was unreal I've never experienced anything like it the acoustics were unbelievable. We wished we could have seen an opera while we were there. If I ever visit Budapest again I would book up way in advance."

Afterwards, we regretted that we didn't bought tickets for the ballet. Tip: buy your tickets for the ballet online and at time, because the shows are sold out quit often."

They have tours in many different languages and if the group is quite large the split you into smaller groups. They tell you all about the opera and the history behind it and you see all of the stunning pieces of art through golden filagree, sculptures, designs on the tapestries and paintings in the ceilings and walls. The interesting thing about this tour that we found quite funny is that they tell you that the opera was only allowed to be build using Hungarian people and materials but you will see that doesn't necessarily seem true but maybe back in the day they believed so. It is still beautiful and worth while to visit. They do student discount and discount if you have your Budapest card. They also have stunning Hungarian chandeliers. They're really beautiful."

The tours are very busy and there a number held in different languages throughout the day. You have the option of a short performance after the tour and this doesn't take place in the main theatre but instead on the main staircase. The singing is impressive and I'm glad I paid the extra for this. Also worth seeing a performance there if you can."

If you are not an opera lover, you can just step in for a minute and admire the marble staircases and the opulent golden decoration. There are also daily tours to visit the building but of course the real thing is when you attend an opera or ballet performance. We went to \u201cthe Bat\u201d by Johann Strauss on December 31st, in Hungary it\u2019s a kind of tradition on new year\u2019s eve. Because of the subtitles projected on the stage, everybody can follow the story easily, even if you don\u2019t know the piece. The quality of the performance was really good, we had a great evening out. During the intermission I would also recommend having a sip of bubbles at the lovely champagne bar, just to make the experience complete. The anecdote goes that when the city council decided to build the opera house, the emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire Franz-Joseph needed to grant permission. He did, but under the firm condition that this new opera theatre in Budapest was not allowed to be larger than that in Vienna. Years later in 1884, when the emperor came to Budapest to attend the opening performance he viewed the interior for a while and then suddenly turned to his Hungarian entourage and exclaimed: \u201cGentlemen, I regret I only mentioned size and not about being more beautiful!\u201d."

I paid for the best seats several months in advance through Eurpoera but when the tickets arrived they were at the back on the side in the third price section. On top we had been charged 4 times the face value! I pleaded with them and with the Opera House directly to be given the seats I had paid for but got no response from the opera house and a partial refund from Europera eventually. I felt very disappointed having to explain to my sister why I had not got the best seats but we decided to make the best of it. The opera was due to start at 7pm as stated on our confirmation however on arrival we were shocked to find the performance time had been moved forwards to 6pm and we had not been told. We were this denied access to the performance until a suitable break and missed the first act. My husband spoke to the theatre manager who asked us to write to him to sort out some recompense. We did this but received no reply. Having spent a large amount of money making the trip for such a special occasion, no one seemed at all concerned about the distress and the upset it caused. To not have the courtesy to reply is very poor and shows the lack of any level of customer service. I am sure the performance itself was very good but I had no enjoyment whatsoever by the time we were pushed into the seats at the back."

It is safe to say that every one of us enjoyed it, though none of us have much interest in opera. Our guide spoke perfect English, was full of interesting facts and we got to see lots of very beautiful parts of the Opera House. It is a spectacular building and the history of it was fascinating. As we left the crowds were arriving for that evening's performance of Die Fledermaus, all dressed up in their suits and evening dresses, which added to the grand atmosphere. Would recommend for anyone interested in 19th and 20th century European history."

We visited the Viennese Opera House earlier this year and I must say the one in Budapest is more beautiful, even though according to the original plans of the Emperor it wasn't supposed to be like this. But hey, Sissy also liked Budapest better!There are usually two guided tours a day, but I recommend you check it on their website first, because it changes during some holidays. You can also buy a ticket for the mini concert which lasts about 5 minutes, but for the price of 600 HUF it's definitely worth it. We took the Spanish language tour and the guide was quite competent. She told us many interesting things about the Opera. You have to pay for the photo sticker as well. The cloakroom costs 100 HUF and I think it's not necessary to charge for this. It's optional anyway, so we were the only people who used it. "

The lobby and entrance halls are beautiful and it is worth going early to have a drink at the bar upstairs and soak it up. We were booked in to see a Wagner piece and had booked into a small box. A serious piece of advice I would give is to not book the second row of seats in any box. They are not raised up and the three people in front of us leaned forward effectively creating a wall of shoulders and we could not see a thing! We ended up standing up for most of the three hour performance which was hugely disappointing. We asked to move seats but it was not possible. The boxes are very good value relative to London prices but I urge you to book the front row!"

If you are planning a trip to Budapest for around Christmas time 2016, then I strongly recommend that you check whether the Nutcracker ballet is being performed and if tickets are available. Our tickets were purchased 6 months in advance and we had front row seats for an unforgettable evening. This is a relatively small venue by modern standards and therefore it feels quite intimate and not at all unfriendly or impersonal. Many people were informally dressed and others were in their finery including a couple of gents in cloaks. The interior decor is stunning and perhaps better seen during a stage production than during a daytime tour. There are quite inexpensive glasses of fizz available in the upstairs bar during the interval. Whilst our request to pre-purchase when we arrived, seemed an unusual request, it avoided having to stand in a 6 metre queue."

What an experience! We saw Cose Fan Tute and is was a magical performance. Even if it wasn't you could not fail to be awed by the surroundings. And one other thing coming to the Opera in Budapest is that it does not cost a kings ransom and is only a fraction of the cost of trying to get a ticket to the Opera in London."

You can also visit the Opera House on a guided tour - where they, I know, say a lot more about the history - but the proper visit is to enjoy an opera here. Even if you are sitting high up, you can enjoy the atmosphere and some top performances. Today's productions are more and more modern, but still enjoyable for the more conservative viewer/listener and form an interesting contrast with the romantic, lavishly decorated building."

This time, though, we got tickets to see The Nutcracker so not only did we see the ballet but we were treated to seeing it in this spectacular building. The lobby is typical of a European opera house with grand staircases and lots of marble but once you get in the theatre itself, you can see how ornate it really is. It reminded a bit of the Palais Garnier in Paris but on a smaller scale. The seats, while old, were surprisingly comfortable. The gold decor is breath-taking. If you can't see a performance there, tours are given once a day in the afternoon."

We had a beautiful little box which wasn't expensive but so lovely. Wasnt sure which seat to sit in as the seats were loose in the box, at half time a couple came and sat in the seats next to us in front of the other people in the box although they did ask permission so not sure what that was about. I guess about 4-6 can fit in a box although we didnt ask for a box, that is just how it is laid out. We saw Andrea Chenier with La Mamma Morta which was glorious. Such a great atmosphere and beautiful place. I felt like royalty and we only had cheapish seats (apprx \u00a318 pp). People wear smart casual/nice wear at the opera. We went to a morning showing which was perfect, about 11am start. One thing at the end of the first half people start cheering and do curtain calls so we were a bit confused but maybe thats normal here!"

Such an exclusive venue should provide a free cloakroom, full stop. These days not everyone takes cash with them, and I wonder what those foreign tourists do who have no Hungarian coins on them at all. I thought it was a shame on our beautiful city.

This is a beautiful opera house but neither the tour or the (extra cost) mini concert met the build up given - I still would do the tour but probably would skip the mini concert (two songs by a great singer with recorded music on the stairs) - while we had a great guide and the group was so large they split it into two the tour felt a bit rushed and superficial - I would have loved to have a demo of the claimed amazing acoustics for example - worth while but could be better done"

Our guide was full of enthusiasm and great facts that really brought the history of a fantastic building to life. We were offered a 'small concert' at the end of our tour for a small additional charge (payable at the start). Whilst it was a pleasant experience with the opera singer dressed to impressed and with a marvellous singing voice I do think we were mis-led as the concert took place on the staircase and not in the auditorium and consisted of two songs!"

The house is opulent but the visit would be much better served by watching an evening opera where the luxuriousness of the venue could truly be felt and experienced.

We also booked the mini-concert afterwards (be careful - not after every tour) that cost about \u00a31.50 each ( 600 HUF) and you got two songs from an opera singer to pre-recorded music but it was exceptional. That takes place on the grand stairway. The place is well worth seeing, very opulent and you get to see most of it, including the main hall.

Such a beautifully stunning building and the buzz of people in the foyer before the performance was exciting. I did the day tour of the building and then to come back in the evening for a performance, I saw the Opera House in all its glory. Even the cloack room was classy! Walking into the venue and hearing the orchestra tuningnup was amazing. Then the actual ballet was something I could never have imagined! Could hear the tap, tap,tap of the ballet shoes on the floor from me seat which was 6 rows back in the stalls. The production and acoustics were nothing I had ever witnessed before. If you are able to see a performance...any performance...treat yourself! The bar during the breaks was worth a visit to people watch! It is something I will never forget."

The say we went, there were about 6 separate groups for English tours alone. Wait at the foyer and when it's time, just give your tickets. As you head up the stairs, some one there will sort you according to groups. The opera house is of course smaller than the one in Vienna but it was one of the very few buildings surviving the war.

They give the history behind the building and funding of the opera house dating back to the 1800's when the Austro-Hungarian Emperor ruled from Vienna. During the 1800's they spared no cost to build this magnificent facility still showing the opera today (Swan Lake was playing,)The tour concludes with views from the box seats and a mini concert, extra, but well worth it. The beautiful young opera singer belts out 2 songs and dances with a tourist and comes right up to the people watching from the stairs. She is so into it, you can see her tears and sweat; a very moving experience!Next door to the opera house was a wonderful bistro (yes we like to eat, but we walk to all these venues.) Callas Bar Cafe offers some excellent coffee and wonderful deserts, (see my separate review with pix of the wow cheesecake!) Reasonable price too for both Callas 3144FT/ $11.76US for beer, coffee and cheesecake and the Opera House Tour was 7500FT/$28.19 including the opera, camera tag and 2 people.Dont let the money scare you, everything here is really low priced and you can use an app called XE currency to do a quick calculation for USD, Euros and HUF/FT (Hungarian Forints.) And contrary to what i previously read, most places do take Amex and Visa which give you what you spent in both currencies immediately online.BTW Weather in October is wonderful; one day light rain, sunny and slightly windy, able to walk everyday around mid 50's sometimes a bit windy but you wont freeze or even need your gloves."

Don't leave Budapest without taking a tour of the Opera House and better stil, if you can attend a live performance please jump at the opportunity. The prices are very, very reasonable."

We went to a modern production by the Hungarian State Opera Company of Othello by Guiseppe Verdi, sung in Italian with English and Hungarian subtitles (projected above the proscenium arch). We had booked several weeks in advance, which is probably necessary if you are visiting Budapest. The opera house building itself is magnificent, and well worth seeing. The staging was impressive, making excellent use of the revolving stage and a separate raising section of the stage. The orchestra was excellent, and the Soprano lead was good. However the Alto and Tenor leads were weak - the Alto particularly so as she was barely audible when singing in duet or with the chorus. The Bass lead was sound enough, without being strong. Overall, a good production, but not of the highest standard."

At the risk of appearing uncultured, I will have to admit that I don\u2019t regularly attend the opera in my home town but I was excited to see the inside of the opera house in Budapest and to see an opera in Europe. Otello was playing and by the time I got around to buying tickets (two weeks before our vacation) not many seats were left. The only two seats together were in a box so I purchased them online from Jegymester.hu; you can print the tickets at home making it super easy. (I later bought tickets for the Parliament tour on the same website.) The Opera House is stunning. Unlike in the USA, the show did not start until thirty minutes after the time on the ticket. I wasn\u2019t sure if that is normal but it seemed like it was. There is a nice area inside to buy food and drinks before the show. Boxes have 4 seats. Three in the front and one behind. Fortunately, a daughter and mother were the other (season) ticket holders and the daughter called and cancelled. We all sat in front. The boxes closer to the stage do not afford the best views but it was nice being able to watch the orchestra. We enjoyed ourselves and were glad we went. Hungarians do dress for the opera. Most women wore black dresses or dress pants. Most men wore ties although there were some people wearing open collared shirts, with or without jackets."

From the street, the remarkable architecture conveys to all that this building is a very special place! We bought tickets to the English language guided tour. There are a few offered each day - some include music. Unfortunately due to time constraints, ours did not include music. There is a premium priced ticket for patrons who want to take photos while on the tour. Every inch of the interior of the building including the reception rooms and stairways were fabulously decorated from the floor to the ceilings. Throughout the tour, my eyes were drawn to the gorgeous gold colored vaulted ceilings illuminated by sparkling chandeliers. There are many statues of famous composers, large and beautiful paintings of renowned opera singers and many pieces of historic opera memorabilia. Eventually we entered the concert hall and it is spectacular! Although this is a relatively small concert hall, it was spectacularly designed and built. According to the experts, the Hungarian State Opera House is acoustically junior to only Milan's La Scala! The concert hall chandelier and ceiling painting are breathtaking. There are dozens of private boxes, with the largest and best located box reserved for the king and queen. If you enjoy classical music, fine architecture, the arts and culture, you must visit this opera house in Budapest!"

And what stands out, about the facility itself, is that it is fairly extravagant, maybe sometimes more gaudy than elegant. And though I stayed around for the mini-concert, the tour doesn't really allow you to experience the acoustics, which I expect is the best part of the facility. If given a chance, a show would probably be more memorable than the tour.The tour, and our guide, provided a good overview of the building (including multiple overlaps with the Parliament) and who / how it has been used over the years. However, it could not compensate for the number of tours under way at one time. There were tours for 5 or so languages, with the English one being broken into three 15+ people groups. They all start at the same time and there just is not enough room to accommodate that many people. Add in those using up extra space for taking pictures (getting their money worth out of the photography pass) and I did not find the experience particularly enjoyable."

To see an actual performance you can book online and I would recommend this based on the performances I've seen in other countries. We came to Budapest in the week and there were no performances until the weekend so take this into account when you book dates.You can't book online for a tour and even if you go the day before they tell you to come back on the day about twenty minutes before a scheduled tour. Whilst we were here (Sept) there were tours at 2pm,3pm and 4pm although the actual tour at 3 started at 3:30 and it's advisable to buy your ticket at least 20 mins before as there were a lot of people there at that time. You will be asked if you want to listen to the 'mini concert' and I would recommend this. It's about \u00a31.50 extra and for that one of the opera singers gives a short performance. Our singer was spectacular. Definitely recommended. The Opera itself is exquisite inside full of luxury and splendour. I did read beforehand that when the weather was hot a tour a tour was unbearable as there was no air conditioning but it was about 35C when we went to Budapest and the Opera was fine. They do now have air con. Don't miss."

The day of the opera we went there and found out that the performance wasn't there!! we met lots of tourists who were in our same situation and had to go by taxi to an auditorium called Erkel to see a ludicrous Carmen which, though in the musical area was great, was nontheless hard to look at, as they chose to do a \"modern\" interpretation and you could see CHEERLEADERS dancing to the sound of the chorus. As an opera lover, this was painful to see, we didn't leave because the orchestra and singers were so good and did their best to overcome such nonsense, not always with the best of success...If what you want is a visit, it's worthy to get in and see."

What you are not told is that the miniconcert is NOT in the old main theatre, but in the more modern second theatre. Unless you want the concert for the concert's sake, forget it4) Street ticket sellers may offer you tickets to the opera in the opera house, but they may not be in the grand old theatre, but instead in the secondary more modern theatre in the building.

Considering they only run 2 tours a day, you would have thought they might have stopped it for at least the music.Finally, don't bother paying extra for the photo permit - most people don't (or aren't even told about it) and there's certainly no checks.

The interior is decorated with beautiful frescos and sculptures. The huge Auditorium can seat around 1200 patrons and is decorated with gold. A massive chandelier weighing three tons hangs in the center of the auditorium. The Hapsburg Emperor allowed the construction of this Opera house on the condition that it should not be bigger than the one in the capital, Vienna. He forgot to add that it should not be more beautiful too. So when the building was completed the Emperor was so upset at it's beauty that he never visited again. His wife Elisabeth though visited it regularly but as she came without her husband she was not permitted to use the Royal Box. So she chose a box closer to the stage and the Royal Box stayed vacant. Touring groups and the Kasa National Opera and Theatrical Troupe performed here during the 19th century. These days the Budapest Opera Ball, an annual event, is held here."

Payable in Florins or Euros.Outside, the building is topped with statues of 16 composers and the floor of the carriage entry (portico) side is parquet wood (so as to soften the clattering of horses' hooves).The senses are totally assaulted inside: built between 1875 and 1884, the cost of construction was 3 1/2 million GOLDEN Florins. Sounds like a lot.Our tour included about 7 or 8 stops for viewing and explanation and we had opportunities to sit in the theater balcony seats and opera boxes, admire the \"Hungarian Painters Room\", take in the auditorium, see behind-the-scenes places where performers changed costumes and snuck a smoke and a snuggle with an admirer, maneuver the grand staircases, and check out where the guests would have checked in their coats.The woods came from Slovenia and Croatia. Marble came from Hungary and Transylvania. Our guide reminded us that Hungary was 75% bigger at the time and the sources for these materials was readily avialable in their provinces.Back in the day of construction, there was a provision stating that all material AND workers MUST come from Hungary. That regulation is no longer in effect.How many kinds of marble colors? I lost count after 10. And almost every wall is clad in brocade coverings in various hues. In the main foyer room (used by only the elite), the ceiling depicts Bacchus who was not only the diety of wine but also the patron saint of the theater. I did not know that.The floors are exquisite: lots of parquet in various patterms, marble stairs, and carpeting here and there. The Opera box gives a great view of the chandelier which weighs 2.1 tons. 1,261 people can be seated and the cost per ticket is 45 Euros each. Assume here that some tickets will cost more or some less.In the Hungarian Painters room there is a portrait of the character \"Carmen\" (a cigar store girl about whom an opera was written) and, yes, she has a cigar in her hand. The staircases have huge mirrors on the walls. Mauve marble, brown marble, all colors of marble are on display and in use.The 3 cloakrooms are works of art in wood. Such detail in the carvings! If you decide to come, you will enjoy the visit more if you can hook up wth a tour. It isn't so easy as just waking around. It is helpful to have an expert make it more meaningful."

            "review": "Great tour, enjoyable ballet...not so fond of the opera. It's hard for me to review this as an attraction, since I had very different experiences on different visits:First, I've been on the operahouse tour 4 times now, and enjoyed it very much every time. While the guides follow the same route and general narrative, they all provide different tidbits and I learned something new each time. It IS much more enjoyable during the off-season, when things are not so crowded, and it IS difficult to take photos (particularly good photos) under the conditions of the tour. I'm fairly serious about photography, so after I went on the tour once, I \"preplanned\" each time which shot I wanted to try for and focused on getting that, and was able to get some very nice photos. For me, this is worth the price, but I can understand why people might feel it's not good value for money. Extra \"photo tickets\" are pretty common in this region, and IMO an extra 500 HUF (~$1.80) is not a big deal, especially since they have always let me purchase one photo ticket to cover two people. I would give the tour 4.5 stars (****1/2). The architecture and history are beautiful and interesting, and the guides well-trained, but due to the size of the tours, fairly impersonal.Second, I saw a ballet (Anyegin) from the cheap upper seats which I enjoyed a lot. For about $5 US, I had a surprisingly good view (especially with binoculars) and as far as I can tell since I am not educated in ballet, quality classical ballet. I would give this experience 5 stars (*****). I wanted to see Swan Lake, but tickets sold out in about 5 seconds flat and it was the middle of the semester, so I didn't have time to go lurk around the box office hoping some would become available.Third, I saw two operas - Carmen, at the Erkel Sz\u00ednh\u00e1z location, and Ariadne auf Naxos, at the main operahouse. The former was enjoyable but underwhelming, but I won't review it here. The latter...was the first time I've ever considered walking out of a professional performance at intermission, but there was no intermission, so I was stuck. While it turns out I probably wouldn't care for that particular opera under any circumstances, I'm mystified as to why they decided to turn it into a bloodbath, systematically killing off all the characters in more and more gruesome ways. When it wasn't gross, it was boring, although the summary made it sound satirical (implying at least a modicum of dark humor). Since Carmen was also a \"modern\" staging,\" I'm now a little wary that the Hungarian State Opera goes for \"modern\" stagings as a matter of course - I'm not opposed to restaging and don't demand everything be staged traditionally, but I do think it's easy to go for shock value and poorly thought-out \"updates\". I would think very hard before trying another of their opera performances, especially when the Budapest Operetta Theatre stages such delightful operettas.I would give Ariadne auf Naxos 1 star (the singing was competent - the bare minimum I hope for, because if opera doesn't have competent singing, it's got nothing) and hope it's not representative."

We saw Spanish or Japanese (smaller) groups being taken to first floor on the balconies as wall as on the outside balcony above the main entrance were pictures could be taken. Unfortunately our group was pushed forward and forward so pictures had to be taken so quickly that we didn't even have time to contemplate beauty of the interiors itself even though extra fee was paid for this privilege.The guide itself had good knowledge of the building with few interesting tips which can not be found in books.The biggest disappointment was the mini concert. We truly thought we would be able to experience someone singing on the main scene so we could hear how this magnificent voices sound on the real scale. Instead we were gathered in the official canteen room where opera singer came out behind the curtain and sang for 5 minutes and left. Great voice but so what. People sitting on the canteen floor is not what I would have paid for in the future.BOGUS!"

The Hungarian State Opera House (Hungarian: Magyar \u00c1llami Operah\u00e1z) is a neo-Renaissance opera house located in central Budapest, on Andr\u00e1ssy \u00fat. Originally known as the Hungarian Royal Opera House, it was designed by Mikl\u00f3s Ybl, a major figure of 19th century Hungarian architecture. Construction began in 1875, funded by the city of Budapest and by Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary, and the new house opened to the public on the 27 September 1884. Before the closure of the \"N\u00e9psz\u00ednh\u00e1z\" in Budapest, it was the second largest opera building in the city; today it is the largest opera house in Budapest and in Hungary.Touring groups had performed operas in the city from the early 19th century, but as Leg\u00e1ny notes, \"a new epoch began after 1835 when part of the Kasa National Opera and Theatrical Troupe arrived in Buda\". They took over the Castle Theatre and, in 1835, were joined by another part of the troupe, after which performances of operas were given under conductor Ferenc Erkel. By 1837 they had established themselves at the Magyar Sz\u00ednh\u00e1z (Hungarian Theatre) and by 1840, it had become the \"Nemzeti Sz\u00ednh\u00e1z\" (National Theatre). Upon its completion, the opera section moved into the Hungarian Royal Opera House, with performances quickly gaining a reputation for excellence in a repertory of about 45 to 50 operas and about 130 annual performances. Today, the opera house is home to the Budapest Opera Ball, a society event dating back to 1886."

If you don't come during the opera season -- or aren't up to sitting through an opera -- make sure to tour the house, even if you are not an opera far. The architecture is just stunning. I'm an enormous fan of the Vienna Staatsoper, but have to confess this building is on a more human scale and is more charming. I have taken several visitors on tours between March and June, so have had a chance to compare how the tours are conducted. No surprise that you get a lot more for your money in the off season - you literally get to see a lot more and you get to spend longer everywhere. Also, groups are smaller. In the peak season, though, they do a genius job of seamlessly weaving the groups among each other, and first-time visitors have no idea they have missed anything. Be sure to spend the extra money for the \"mini-concert.\" It's only tow arias but done with enormous verve and is a great way to round off the tour. And if you do come during the opera season -- tickets are inexpensive by Western standards and performances are of a very high standard."

It was built in order to compete with the opera houses of Paris, Vienna and Dresden. He was the life work of the great Hungarian architect Miklos Impl. The interior is decorated with works of Hungarian artists such as Lodz and Strobl. From that time until today the Opera has hosted some of the most famous composers, like Erkel, Gustav Mahler and Otto Klemperer. The central hall of the Opera is decorated with a bronze chandelier weighing 3,050 kg, which illuminates a wonderful fresco of Lodz with the gods of Olympus. Also the royal gallery is decorated with sculptures symbolizing the four voices of opera: alto, soprano, bass, tenor."

I bought tickets over the internet for \"Jenufa\" rather than take the tour of the opera house. I had been dying to visit as the previous and first time I was in Budapest the opera was out for the summer. The exterior looks old but that adds to it's charm and atmosphere. The interior is stunning!What can I say. It is the most beautiful opera house, ornate and plush. We had a box and it was great. We inspected the balcony with all the beautiful statues and alcoves, and all the beautiful stair cases, the interior. My jaw simply dropped open. The opera itself was wonderful! I ate my heart out that I did not get tickets for Swan Lake as well. So we tried the box office and there were just 2 tics left but expensive, and because we were tired from a long day of running around in this amazing city, we didn't take them and wisely so. My husband would have dropped off which would have been painful at 50 euros per ticket. As it turned out, we went to the wonderful Budapest Jazz Club, and sadly there I dropped off when it came to the jam session (free) past 11 p.m. which was absolutely smashing, but I was so tired and it was so late. It's better to buy tickets on the internet because you can see exactly where you sit and you do not have to go for the higher prices. Our tickets cost 17 or 19 euros each (don't remember) and were perfectly adequate. Another plus is you can plan your day accordingly. In my case it is imperative that my husband gets some rest before so he doesn't drop off (and he didn't)."

Total was approx 7000ft for two, for a guided tour, a five minute mini concert and permission to take photos. Because of the very large group it was often difficult to hear the guide. The interior, compared to the Vienna or Paris Opera houses, was extremely poor. Decor was shabby and neglected, statues or busts were mostly chipped and seemed to be made of plaster of Paris and not authentic. Fabrics, flooring and decor were not original but cheap copies. The five minute mini concert, for which we paid extra, was a disgrace...150 people cramped into a small room (not the main auditorium), were made to stand and listen to a singer that could not be seen by 90% of those present.

We did not have the time to attend a full opera at the opera house while we were in Budapest, but we really wanted to see it from the inside. A tour is offered at 3 and at 4 pm. We took one of them and enjoyed it very much. The tour is offered in multiple languages, and although there were multiple groups touring at the same time, you did not feel it was crowded. The guides are knowledgable and always waited for all the people of the group to arrive at a spot of explanation before talking. At the end, you have an option of adding a few extra euros to hear a \"mini\" sample concert with one of the singers which was very cute. The opera house is amazing from the inside!"

We went on a Monday at 3:00 and there were about 25 people on our english tour...then there were about 15-20 people in each of the other tours as well. I do recommend it, just because the inside is exquisite but it is pretty expensive for what you get (2,900 HUF + 500 extra if you want to take pictures). It would be WONDERFUL if they allowed an option to walk through without the guide, but they do not. You learn a bit but it was very loud from competing with the other groups.

Also the guides are a little bit or miss. We started our tour with a guide who seemed disinterested and bored, but for some reason part way through the tour we switched tour guides and our second guide was really engaging and passionate.

But worth paying good money to walk around without actually seeing an opera? Certainly not.

The lobby is poorly designed for ticket purchases and the process is tedious. Definitely book a performance of any type when you are there. The acoustics are wonderful. The cheap seats ($10 in the upper balcony), provide great views and fine acoustics but are cramped and very uncomfortable. If you are in town and interested in any kind of performance, make this the first stop because most performances sell out well in advance.

Many people in the group were pushing forward and were quite rude in trying to get closer to the guide. The guide's English was very good, but she was a little hard to hear at times. The interior of the building is impressive and richly decorated. I purchased an extra ticket to be allowed to take pictures inside, but I saw others without the ticket taking photos on their phones and other devices. We also paid extra to hear a performance at the end of the tour. A gentleman came out in costume and sang three short arias and interacted with the crowd a bit. He was a great singer and we enjoyed his performance, but in hindsight, we should have just attended a performance there. We would probably have had less trouble with rude tourists and might have been able to take in the beauty of the building better at a performance. I do think it's worth it to spend the money to see the Opera House, but you may want to think about attending a performance instead."

On my bucket list was to attend an Opera and what better place to fulfill this wish than At the Hungarian State Opera House! We purchased tickets online about a month before our trip. We picked seats in row two of one of the opera boxes - not a good choice - get the first row of seats in the opera boxes because you cannot see the stage from the second row. Luckily, the first row people did not show so we were able to move up. We saw Vivaldi's Farnace. The orchestra and the opera singers were excellent! Although I had never attended an opera, I have been to countless symphanies, musicals, and other concert events. The artistic interpretation of this Vivaldi opera was very interesting and very different. Overall, we are very glad we attended an actual performance to see the glory of the building in use. One concern we had was the dress code for the opera. We were in Budapest when the temperature reached 96 degrees F. My husband had packed a suit jacket to wear, but it was just too hot. He wore a nice pair of dress slacks and a nice long sleeve dress shirt which was perfect for the occasion. I wore a pair of black slacks with a dressy blouse which also worked very well for the evening. Most people were dressed similar to us, There were some men in suits and ties, but most were in smart business casual. A nice dress or dress pants and blouse were typical for women. Definitely would recommend going to an actual opera performance and buying the tickets online before you go!"

I don't think it's fair for a less than great review to be read in Trip Advisor without having shared my opinion with the location prior. Which I did before leaving the Opera House. We paid for an English speaking tour. A rather large group. Other language specific groups started their tours at the same time. So, imagine five different groups entering the grand seating hall and the tour guides, trying their best to yell loud enough for all to hear. Let's just say there was competition. I'd say it's important to hire guides with Maria Callas lungs if this is the situation. Oh, and have I mentioned there were actors/singers on the stage trying to have a rehearsal. They gave up while the groups were in the room. The large English group was split in two. Then as we toured the building, there were times where two groups were sharing a room (see earlier competing tour guides comments...), or passing in a hallway. So essentially, while we SAW a beautiful building, we HEARD less than 50% (being generous) about it.So, after the tour I went up to the lady who sold us tickets and expressed my concern. She invited me to share with her boss where my comments should be heard, and I was escorted to her. The young lady who escorted me said that Mondays are particularly crowded due to many tourist attractions being closed (so everyone goes there). Call me crazy but maybe management should staff for that? Maybe add some tours, or space them 10 minutes apart?The manager was respectful and courteous as I relayed my complaint. I believe she said the rehearsal was part of the problem - get the groups in and out so they can continue. I asked what normally happens? The groups are one at a time. She said the original guide should have explained all of this. But wait...many of us couldn't hear the guide.... I shared that I was pleased to see such a beautiful building, it's just that I couldn't tell her anything that I'd learned. She thanked me and hoped that I at least enjoyed the building. I did. It was beautiful. But, no offer of a refund, partial refund, or an invitation to come back on Tuesday when more tourist sites are open, and supposedly, no five different language groups navigating at the same time and guides speaking up, and up, so folks could hear. Go see this building, just make sure you can hear about it."

Be sure to enjoy a coffee at the adjacent Calle coffee house and marvel at the yet-to-be-restored building across the street. (Our understanding is that the developers want to turn it into a five star hotel under the condition that the Hungarian authorities allow an underground parking facility. So far the Hungarian authorities aren't budging, perhaps a throwback to the days of Communism.)One thing to say for the Communist influence: My understanding that it's still possible to get very affordable seats for this still state-subsidized opera."

In this case I would probably advise going with either 1st or last row (middle only) on the balcony. Other sits are fine, but do not rely (expect) to see something on the screens hanging from both sides, they are too small. Subtitles appear right in the middle above the scene, English and Hungarian. Quite big front, convenient to read from every location. Please take into account that once you are buying cheapest tickets to the balcony, there is a separate entrance, you are not allowed to enter via main entrance and should use the door from the backside. The performance itself is awesome/ lights, costumes, singing - all at the top level."

My girlfriend and I went to see Faust at the Hungarian State Opera. we bought our tickets two days in advance and were told that there were only box seats left. At a price of 50 Euros we decided to go for it, thinking that we'd been a little duped. However, on the evening of the opera it was jam-packed with not an empty seat in the house, and there we were with the best box seats looking directly on stage. The selection of intermission food refreshments was uniquely Eastern European I found with pretzels and open sandwiches. The performance was world-class and the set designs were inspired. My only warning is that the seats in the balcony boxes are not very comfortable."

You can purchase the tickets in the building on either side, and the prices vary on the seats (from 400 HUF to 9,900 HUF). We got stall seats which presented a good view centrally, that was 8,000 HUF, which cost cira \u20ac25 each - in comparison to westend musical prices this was good value, especially as this was our first opera. Tips: shows started circa 8pm, and they ask you leave your coats in the cloakroom (bring change). I would also recommend to dress smart (since some people go all out). The opera was in Hungarian, though there was English subtitles above the live performance and orchestra. There was four acts, so a few breaks in between, where you can wonder round. Although our seats were good, the boxed seats looked private and worth a go if available, choice wise."

Inside, it is a riot of golden columns, marble staircases, colourful painted ceilings and mosaic floors as you enter.Strangely, there are two huge cloakrooms, but no bars. They set up a table to serve drinks in the foyer before and in the interval of, performances. As usual in old places like this, ladies will spend the whole interval queueing for the pathetically inadequate number of toilets.The auditorium is even more spectacular: it's not that big (1600 seats, I think) but arranged in the typical multi-tiered boxes, balconies and stalls style. We had a seat in the central stalls, but probably anywhere would do for a performance to satisfy. The cheapest seats are about \u00a32!I found the performance, though tremendously well staged, overlong (6.00pm start; 9.40pm finish. Four acts; one interval) and tediously repetitive, but a true opera fan would love it, I'm sure. The acoustics are excellent and the staging extended to bring the performers (immaculately robed, as you would guess) out into the stalls.Tip: either walk there or use The Opera Metro station."

We got the impression that the tour was designed by someone who just wanted to have fun with the poor visiting tourists. First of all, you pay a general admission fee, then if you want to take pictures, you pay an additional fee, and lastly, if you'd like to hear a short 5-minute aria performed by one of the opera performers, you pay another fee.Then the fun begins. There must have been about 6 tours going on simultaneously in different languages, with one group going up, another going down, another going right, and more going left. If you aren't careful, you could wind up with a different group with the tour guide speak a language that doesn't quite sound like English anymore :)The tour is very rushed, with time for about a picture or two before you see your group heading out the door and you have to run to catch up. The real positive part of the tour (which upped my rating to 3) was the live aria performed, not in the theater itself, but in a vestibule area probably used by opera goers at intermission time. This was actually a positive, as our singer was no more than about 6' in front of us while performing. Very nice!!"

Instead of fussing about orchestrating multiple language guides, an audio guide would have been far better.The mini-concert at the end (which was the equivalent of \u00a31), consisting of two songs. It was good. But overall, the tour was expensive for what it was."

The acoustics of the building are very good, and the performances are tight and professional - extremely enjoyable. Prices are not cheap, but are reasonable considering the place and the quality of the performances. To go to Budapest and miss the opera would be a terrible thing. Oh, and dress varies quite a lot.

Built in the neo-Renaissance style back in the 1870-80s, it's a sturdy yet elegant-looking building and well known for its amazing acoustics. On opposite sides of its portico, look for the statues of Ernst Liszt (the famous composer) and Ference Erkel (who wrote the Hungarian national anthem). Today, the building houses the Hungarian National Ballet and is the venue for the annual Hungarian Opera Ball. When I visited, it was in the middle of a heatwave and there were no performances scheduled. I was informed that the opera house wasn't air-conditioned so it was easy to see why opera and ballet could only be performed in the cooler months. The best I could do was look around and admire the stunningly decorated ceiling and the grand staircase."

I highly recommend shopping around for tickets as I saw my same ticket for 59 euros elsewhere.

While this opera house was built on this grand scale only at the turn of the last century and is relatively young, it is an architectural gem inside and out with the auditorium, public foyers and grand staircases decorated in glorious style. I think the ceiling painting was by Lotz, famous also for the grand hall at the Paris department Store further up Andrassy Ut. So, if you cannot get a seat for an opera or opera is not your thing, try the conducted tours of which there are, I think, two a day.However, it is best to enjoy an opera in the house. While the seats are hard (cushioned only by the opera goer's own fatty padding!), the acoustic is superb thanks to the wooden floors. We saw a wonderful \"Marriage of Figaro\" sung in Italian, of course, but with Hungarian and English surtitles, that was sung beautifully by the whole cast supported by a wonderful sound from the pit under an excellent conductor. It was a great night at the opera in a stunning house.The bars in the dress circle salon were busy with slow queues but they offered reasonable fare and there was access to the grand balcony over the main entrance porte cochere though the dress circle salon is itself a wonderful room in which to enjoy an interval glass of wine.The wee shop is staffed by lovely, helpful staff. The only down side, as in many a theatre, are some in the audience of which I will say no more though the hard, uncushioned seats may have caused some of the bobbing about."

This was an understated, subtle and in places melancholy performance of an opera that has been subject in recent years to so many (increasingly) bizarre interpretations apparently in search of novelty. The simplicity and sheer beauty of this performance were key to our enjoyment. And then the Opera House itself, which is worth a visit (they do tours) even if one is not there for a performance, surely one of Europe's most impressive opera houses. Note that the opera is performed in Italian with English and Hungarian subtitles cleverly projected in a non-intrusive way. A truly lovely evening."

If you want to take photographs on the tour you need to purchase the red wrist band PRIOR, as well as the mini concert afterwards requires a blue wrist band prepurchased."

We were amazed to find that the main cast took curtain calls after each act, not just at the conclusion of the performance. We saw Bank Ban, a nationalistic opera that was playing because the National holiday took place that weekend. It was a great opera and I found the CDs of it sold at a nearby CD store.

The floors creak, the chairs squeak, and the gradual slope of the floor leaves patrons in the row ahead of you at eye level but all of that is overshadowed by the grandeur of the hall and the experience. Ticket prices for the performance were very reasonable. The performance was in German but English and Hungarian subtitles were displayed on a screen above the stage.

English tours are at 3 and 4 in the afternoon. The tours do not concentrate on the Opera as much as the building. A couple of things to point out - the tour was noisy as they had 3 or 4 groups in different languages at the same time, and they were doing some work on the stage so at times it was hard to hear the guide, who was very knowledgeable. One other thing, it does cost extra to take photos so be prepared to delegate one in your group to do the photography."

There was very little legroom, and our seats were single (one in front of the other) up on a platform, one higher than the other). The second night, we sat down in the main auditorium, 17th row, seats 10, and the view was once again perfect.Both operas (Ariadne & Das Rhinegold) were well staged, but not traditionally done. The actors and the orchestra were very good, but both stories had been \"updated\" to a more modern theme. I would have preferred something more traditional (truthfully, I was hoping for the big Viking woman with the horns and breastplate, belting out the tunes!), but that's just my opinion. The Opera House itself is amazingly beautiful, and well worth going to see."

Four about 1/4 of the price of Wiener Staatsoper, you can sit in a box seat, experience similar grandeur, and nearly equivalent acoustics. Magyar Allami Operahaz is smaller than Wiener Staatsoper. I would also not suggest getting box seats in the second or third row (where it would be very difficult to see). But if you can get a front-row box seat, this is a wonderful experience.

Very high production value at a fraction of the cost of seeing some provincial, half-rate production in the UK. (we paid \u00a33.70 each, and these weren't the cheapest seats!!). Despite the price people seem to dress up which really adds to the experience. The only down point is that we had to walk up eight flights of stairs to get to the balcony. (no lifts.)If you go then book on line. Its in English and you print your own tickets. Really added to our pre-trip excitement."

The house was spectacular and the show (we saw the Hungarian opera Bank Ban) was excellent. The orchestra was not quite A-level, but the cast was really good and the production was a high quality. If you can't make a show, be sure and visit the guided tour in the afternoon. It is worth it to go around and see the magnificent building itself."

In Rick Steve's book it said that it would be adequate to buy as cheap a ticket as possible even with an obstructed view. Foolishly we followed that advice. We had to go in the side door of the opera house, up some concrete stairs to our upper tier seats. In order to see the front 1/3 of the stage we had to lean forward. We were not given a program and had no idea what was happening in the scenes. We were not impressed with the principal ballet dancers. Most people around us seemed bored. We left at intermission.The building dates back to the 1890's. It was damaged during WWII and restored in the 1980's. Is this as beautiful as other European opera houses, probably not."

Although we had read somewhere that it is good to have a snack in the interval we could only find nuts or rolls to go with the Hungarian sparkling wine we purchased (which again cost a fraction of the amount charged at Western European venues). Dress code is mixed - there were some people in casual clothes and at the other end of the scale some couples (although very much the minority) in ball gowns, furs and rather Hapsburg suits looking as though they had been trapped in a very elegant middle European pre-war time capsule.We found it very easy to buy tickets before we left England and we had tickets in the middle of the stalls for a price which was a fraction of the amount we would have had to pay in London or Paris.Definitely worth doing if you are visiting Budapest."

Unfortunately, this fell far short of what we hoped for.We took the tour at 3pm, and it cost 2,900 Ft (about 10 Euro at the time and more than the outdated information found on their website). While I didn't expect the tour to be very long because there was another one at 4pm, the total amount of time we were actually on the tour was about 40 minutes, if that. We saw the main auditorium, the main bar, the smoking room, the royal entry-way, and the staircase. And that was it. Sure, the guide told us some interesting things about the building, but nothing I couldn't have learned from Wikipedia.During the tour, the guide mentioned that there are regular seats for actual operas for 1,500 Ft. That being said, plan ahead and buy a 1,500 Ft seat for the opera and spend 3 hours there, soaking up the ambiance in the same rooms. The tour doesn't include anything technical, nor anything that interesting. So just think ahead of time and go to the opera instead. Otherwise, the tour is waste of time and money."

I am not an opera buff by any means but our outing to Madame Butterfly this week was a fabulous experience - you can do tours of the building during the day but the true ambiance is best experienced by going to a performance - really gives you a nostalgic feeling for a grander age - and it starts at the opera metro station!"

We saw Otello an the prices are quite reasonable for the monument you are able to see, and see and see as many times as you want. The lower stalls are not as big as they seem in the website where you can buy the tickets, so don't buy the highest prices, but the second ones, the view is perfect. You have 3 acts with 2 / 15 minute breaks so you will have plenty of time (more than 3 hours) to watch the place and feel as a Habsburg while watching a classic opera show. Otello had English subtitles for your convenience :D"

            "review": "SInging Praises for the Hungarian Opera House. Tour and PerformanceWe took the opera house tour and also attended an opera performance and found the theater to be both visually and acoustically exceptional. It does, however, have the age-old problem of not having enough restroom space for women (only two stalls each side of the ground floor, for example, meant a long, tedious wait during the performance intermissions). The tour: The house runs two tours per day (at 3:00 and 4:00) in a number of languages. The cost seemed nominal but the tour is only about 45 minute in length\u2014and you must pay extra if you plan to take photos. (This is required even if you have only a camera phone.) The ticket booth accepts Euros\u2014it is one of the few places in the city we found willing to do so: although Hungary is part of the EU it has not yet been authorized the use of the Euro. All ticket holders meet in the foyer and then split into groups based on language, congregating in different areas on the beautiful double grand staircase. Each group then takes off in different directions but all tours cover the same space. No backstage area is included in the tour, which focuses on the architecture, the art, and the history of the front part of the house. The building itself is Neo- Renaissance and is considered one of the finest buildings of its type in Europe. It was opened in 1884 and soon became one of the leading houses on the continent, with the celebrated composer Gustav Mahler being director for three seasons. According to one study, the house has the finest acoustics in Europe, following La Scala (Milan) and the Paris Opera. The 3-story high auditorium is in the traditional horseshoe shape and seats 1200+; the primary colors throughout are red and gold. On the top row the names of prominent operas are displayed on the exterior of the boxes. The royal box is located centrally on the second floor and is decorated with sculptures symbolizing the four operatic voices - soprano, alto, tenor and bass. On the ceiling are Karoly Lotz\u2019s frescoes depicting Olympus and the Greek gods. A huge gilded chandelier hangs from the ceiling\u2014it is lowered by pully annually so that all bulbs can be replaced. The orchestra pit can be raised to the level of the stage and during the Opera Ball, the seats in the orchestra stalls are removed to allow for dancing. On the day we toured, the stage was already set for the evening\u2019s performance (Otello) and we got to see the details of the opening scene. The buffet room is decorated with events from Greek mythology in the ceiling and landscape painting on the sidewalls. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, was thorough in her presentation and answered each question completely. The tour was interesting and we would recommend it as a must do if you have time.The PerformanceWe were lucky enough to get tickets for an evening performance of one of our favorite operas, Verdi\u2019s Otello. It was nicely stage, traditional but not stuffy. The cast was quite good, especially the lead (Otello) who was performed by international tenor sensation Jos\u00e9 Cura. The acoustics were superb, the orchestra well-rehearsed and dynamic, and the audience knowledgeable and respectful. As mentioned earlier, restrooms for women are a problem, even more so than in many other houses.A couple of observations about performances:Because of the horseshoe shape\u2014which enhances acoustics\u2014there are many seats with sight line restrictions. If you don\u2019t get a seat in the orchestra (ground) try to get seats toward the middle to minimize the problem.Floors in the boxes are flat so if you are not in the first row you may find yourself watching bobbing heads instead of dance or opera. In some cases, you are allowed to stand if necessary.Performances (at least the opera) are still considered events and people have a tendency to dress. We didn\u2019t see many evening gowns per se, but the vast majority of the audience seemed to be in business attire or better. We did see a few folks in casual clothes, however, so if you find yourself wanting to attend and didn\u2019t bring formal-wear, go anyway. It will be worth it.Ticket prices compared to comparable theaters in capital cities across Europe are extremely reasonable. As comparison, we sat in row 2 in Vienna (orchestra) and paid almost $400 a ticket. For La Scala, for approximately the same location, we paid almost $300. In Budapest, for first row, we paid less than $100. We encourage everyone to take the time to see a ballet or opera at the Hungarian Opera House, even if not an aficionado. The atmosphere, the elegance, the history will draw you in\u2026..highly recommended."

The Budapest Philharmonic sounded fine from seats in the center of the main floor, but seats on the corners of the balcony lose sight of parts of the stage during Opera productions. To get to the upper reaches one must go outside, enter through a side door, and climb many flights of steps. While the interior is elegant in the old world way, there are more tricky steps within the balconies themselves. For opera performances in Budapest, the Erkel Theatre offers better visibility and comparable sound, with interior steps that may be slightly less hazardous to negotiate."

Had I not been tall, and able to see the Guide\u2019s paddle, I could have easily gotten mixed up in one of the other groups. Side Note: The day we visited, there was a special event going on, so there was no 3pm tour. All visitors were asked to come back & attend the 4pm tour. I don\u2019t know how many people are typically in a tour group, but the foyer was packed to the gills, and organizing everyone into their proper language groups was a challenge. This issue may have led to the rushed and frenzied feel of our experience, but did not take away from the beauty of the Opera House. A must see!"

The Hungarian State Opera House offers an amazing opportunity to soak in the powerful elegance (yes, elegance) of Hungarian architecture. From the outside marble pillars to the ornate chandelier and vaulted ceilings, the Opera House is a visual masterpiece. I did not take one of the tours; however, I did have a chance to attend one of the opera shows and absorb the truth behind the \"3rd best acoustics\" rating for an opera venue in the world. If you have a chance, I highly suggest purchasing a ticket a week or two in advance to see a show as more seats will be available. For two people sitting in the upper gallery (offered a pretty good view, not great!) it cost only $16. Great for a date or just to soak in the artistic side of the city.If you purchase a ticket for the upper gallery, you sadly do not get to use the famous wide staircase to go to your seat. You must exit through the main entrance and head to the right side of the building. The access door to the stairs can be a little hard to find as we overshot our entrance door and had to double back when we were alerted to our error by a friendly door attendant. Brace yourself for a steep climb. There was an elderly man who really looked like he was struggling to get up the multiple flights of stairs...so if you have health issues, I would pay more to sit in an easily accessible area or ask for assistance to the top. There is a coat check for a small fee and a bar as well, even for the peasants who have to watch in the upper gallery like me. Overall, I highly recommend catching a show so you can at least humble-brag to your friends about how extremely cultured you are as evidenced by your experience at the opera in Budapest's premier opera house!"

Originally an opera by Tchaikovsky based on a plot of Pushkin's verse novel Eugene Onegin.We managed to get tickets for this performance not knowing much about the dancers and the story. Having read the story we were looking forward to seeing this ballet very much.It is a simple story of love, betrayal and tragedy. A dandy rejects a young country girl's genuine love , she successfully grows into a worldly woman, he tries to seduce her, but it is too late. He also kills his best friend in a dual, which he regrets bitterly afterwards. The performance had great drama and understanding, danced mainly by Russian performers.In our opinion, this was an outstanding performance, one of the best we have ever seen in the Hungarian Opera House. It was a magical night, dancers, scenery, lighting were equally excellent. It was uplifting to the soul, even though it reflects on human behaviour shortcomings.If you have a chance go and see it. The encores and the celebrations and the number of curtain calls said it all. The normally subdued crowd that attend the Opera House, knew that they had seen something really special. I have written about the Opera House's productions many times before, so I will not repeat myself here. It is always a joy to go there and the ticket prices are a fraction of any other Western house's."

The location of this Budapest attraction was the most confortable for us, since our lodging was located at 50 m from Opera House.Two exclusively guided tours are foreseen every day, at 3 and 4 pm, in different languages; to participate, it\u2019s just a matter to go into the Opera House, just 10 min before the chosen tour, and take the tickets. The visitors are divided then into several groups according to the language, and gathered at different points of the entrance stair, and finally guided inside the building.The ticket fare is 2900 Ft per adult (approximately 9.00 Euro); I paid 500 Ft more to get authorized to take photos (I got a red bracelet, to be \u201cidentified\u201d), but I saw several people doing it free-of-charge\u2026 Against a further fee, a mini-concert is offered once the tour is completed.Since many groups (languages) were simultaneously making the tour, the guides\u2019 explanation was a bit noisy and disturbing each other; further to that, the tour and explanation were in my opinion too fast, not giving the way to assimilate the big quantity of information we were getting from the guide.I believe that such rushed tour was consequence of Opera needs for practice and staging, before the day show; nevertheless, the overall impression I got was that such guided tours are arranged with the main purpose to get money.Said that, the Opera House is really wonderful, showing a rich and stylish setting. The sequence of different halls along the way allows to appreciate lavish stairs, golden decorative stuccos, huge mirrors, and the wonderful fresco ceilings of Karl Lotz.The stage is very huge, as the parterre area is; Opera is proposing a daily show (it seems that the rates are affordable by everybody), consisting of ballets, grand operas, orchestras performances, alternating to each other.Summarizing, the attraction definitely worth a visit, but a slower motion would have been much more appreciated and could probably be better organized."

A local friend was able to get us tickets to La Boh\u00e8me, and we made sure to pack nice clothes and read up on the story. In December the opera house is beautifully lit for the holidays, and we were greeted out front by characters from the Nutcracker and a choir singing Christmas carols. Inside, after a little confusion of where to go, we ascended the grand stairways into the gilded theater and our 5th row seats. I have to admit that I am not typically an opera person, but I can appreciate beautiful things. Highlights for me included the four male voices in Act 1, the party scene in Act 2, and the sets truly conveying the sense of winter poverty. The screen over the stage showing the Hungarian translation of the Italian opera wasn\u2019t much use to me, but it hardly mattered. It was a fantastic experience!"

There aren't an awful lot of signs which resulted in a lot of people not knowing where to queue. Queue down the middle to have your tickets checked and you will either be allowed straight through or sent back out to the main foyer so you can go up the left hand or right hand staircase for your seats. We had seats in Box 6 which was beautiful but we were initially put in the wrong seats so thought we had scored big time and were in the front of the box! This didn't last long and we were moved back to the correct seats which were a real let down. The seating plan on the website shows that we booked seats in row three next to each other. In reality row three is actually one seat on a raised platform flush against the side wall with another chair wedged onto a slightly more raised platform behind that. Leg room was minimal and it was practically impossible to see the stage at all. We stayed until the first interval and then left but we had seen what we wanted to see and given that the tickets are very reasonably priced we didn't really feel that we had lost out. If your plan is to go for the duration though definitely make sure you get seats further forward otherwise you will be disappointed. There is a small drinks selection but you can't take anything into the main theatre with you. There is a cloakroom but you pay a small charge to leave your coats. There are staff on every floor who will help you to your seat."

Both were fabulous but Tosca might be a better choice for newer opera fans as they even put the surtitles in English for this more popular work. We love opera but can't always afford good seats here in the UK. We felt really spoiled to be able to afford the very best seats here at around \u00a328 each for even the front stalls. Both operas had two intervals and with a full house on the two nights it made sense to order interval drinks before the performance. If you're splashing out on the best seats it also makes sense to match this at the interval too. We had glasses of the really very good extra dry Hungarian champagne on each occasion. Couldn't believe it was less than \u00a310 for four glasses! That was the gilt on the gingerbread for me!"

The opera was in traditional Italian, subtitled in Hungarian and English. I sat in the balcony - great choice. Excellent visibility, very reasonably priced tickets.The entrance to the balcony is tricky though. Side door has to be used instead of the central. The ticket prices deserve special attention. Of course they vary from performance to performance and by seat a lot, yet are relatively low. They start around 5 Euros (or less). There are famous performances that sell out really fast. For example The Nutcracker (the ballet) that is traditinally performed in December and around Christmas sold out 99% in mid-October."

Since we booked rather late, we had to get seats in the gods, far on stage left.We arrived late, not by much, but the overture was already playing. Apparently, when you have seats in the Gods in Hungary, you have to enter through a tradesmen's entrance on the side of the building, then climb four flights of bare concrete stairwell to arrive in a little lobby where we waited for the overture to be finished to be seated so as to not disturb the audience.When we were finally admitted, a very blonde little martinet no older than 18 stopped us from taking our seats, explaining that they had been taken by other patrons just before the show started. We both work in show business so we weren't very suprised but what came next was priceless.The gods were about 1/2 full, with most of the audience in the centre and a smattering on the wings which were four rows deep. Instead of letting us sit in one of the many easily accessible empty seats, we were required to stand on the landing at the top of the gods for the best part of an hour before being allowed to sit. During that time, the curtain closed three times for set changes and salutes and the house lights came on, for about a minute each time. We were not allowed to sit, but at least we had company, there were about 8 people on our side of the gods in the same predicament, whenever anyone tried to discretely take a seat during our 'penalty time', the martinet would, loudly, tell them to stand back on the landing.When we, at long last, got to sit, it was to realize that we couldn't see the stage at all. we expected bad seats, it is the gods after all, but we couldn't see the stage, by sitting on the rim of my chair i could just make out a little quadrant of stage and had to rely on a video screen showing the stage with horrible color correction."

The Opera House is beautiful inside, and overall, I am glad I went to experience my first opera, Tannhauser by Wagner.There are several things I can recommend to make your visit better, and which would have improved my experience.If you are going to see an Opera, sit low to the ground or in the back. I had a seat on the second (American third) balcony to the right. The stage view was fine, but at that height, you can see the conductor's stand, and the lightbulbs on it are way too bright. I either had to hold my hand out the entire performance to block the glare, or sit back farther so the ledge blocked it (but then the fancy gilt heads blocked some stage view) My moving around probably didn't please the people behind me. The tickets are labeled \"upper level circle\" or lower level, etc, but the actual floors are simply labeled \"I emelet, II emelet (first floor, second floor) etc. So you have no idea if you're on the correct level. Check with the attendant, even if you are sure you have the right level. We didn't.Make sure you know the opera before hand. The program cost an extra 1000 huf, I didn't pay so I don't know what was in it. There was no way for me to know how many acts were coming, how much time we had at intermission, or generally what was going on. There ARE subtitles in Hungarian, but if you don't know Hungarian, it doesn't help.The cast is Hungarian, I was told by another patron that most of them sang rather muddled German, so he could not understand them. Again, know the opera beforehand.As far as the Tannhauser performance, after watching other versions on Youtube, i think this would disappoint an opera enthusiast. Venus and Elisabeth are played by the same woman. The choreography was messy, and I thought perhaps ballet in the opera is not as important as the singing. But it would have been more impressive if, when the dancers made the same movements, if they were synchronized. It seemed very amateur. Go to the opera. Buy cheaper seats at the front of the balcony in the back of the curve. Bring some binoculars (though the auditorium is small, you will be able to see the general movement) and do some research before hand. It can be a great introduction."

Having sat in all of the different areas we would say it is worth paying more for the stalls. The Upper Circle tends to be patronised by groups of young people who are not always the quietist.

Bought the first level box seat (about U$65), it has 3 individual seats, and a sofa (sits 2), inside the box, there's coat hanger and a wall-mount stand to put drinks. Unlike some other opera, box 1 seat 1's view is impacted by the pillars of the first side box, so I'd recommend not to book box 1 level 1 from either side. We didn't get the time to go to the roof top though which should be beautiful at night. The sphinx is at the left side of the main entrance, which is featured in Budapest Opera House's TV ad."

The performances were strong. Even if you may not be interested in Opera, it's worth seeing one performance while in Budapest.

Even though they may not be world class they put on some enjoyable performances which have occasional stand out singers and unusual avant garde productions. Most recently I went to see 'Die Frau ohne Schatten' and at over 3 hours the lack of padding on the seats was telling. If you suffer when the seats are hard do yourself a favour and take a small cushion. The other production on my this most recent visit to Budapest was 'Tosca' with an outstanding vocal from the visiting Italian tenor as Mario Cavaradossi. Our visit was only marred by the visiting British Opera snob sitting next to us who did nothing but complain. Good value and a lovely night out, and bookable on line before you go"

When we walked in realised a show was about to start and asked if there were any available tickets left, and there were!! Paid only \u00a320 for two, for pretty decent seats on the balcony. Had to use the side entrance to get to the right floor and there was a crazy amount of stairs, my mum has problems walking and no one has told us about it, so it took a long while to get upstairs, to the 5th floor (I think). But when we got there we easily found our seats and enjoyed the whole thing! Great experience!"

I don't recall the price but I believe it was around $35 USD per ticket for the upper level - definitely reasonable. The building was beautifully ornate, just as you would expect, and the concert was outstanding (Tchaikovsky). The best part was being squeezed in among the locals and witnessing their traditions (certain ways of clapping, etc.) and their genuine enthusiasm for the music and the conductor.If you have an opportunity to attend a concert in this venue, I highly recommend it!

It is not difficult to imagine what it must have been like in the early 1900's with women in gowns on the staircases. The acoustics are supposed to be one of the best according to Wikipedia, third behind La Scala and the Paris Opera House. Saw Tosca and enjoyed the show, was impressed that the singers were all Hungarian. Surtitles are in English and Magyar. As others have noted, seats are a *little* hard (not sure how one brings in their own cushion, but if you can figure out how to do that it might be helpful)."

A costumed mezzo soprano stepped out from behind the curtains and sang two arias . We were about four feet away from her glorious singing. We don't even like the opera very much. BUT being this close, this personal, was something unusual and wonderful. Highly recommend (although other guests heard a lute player, not so impressive). The first aria (don't know the name of it) was so sad (even though it was in Italian) that many in this small audience burst into tears. A rare treat indeed."

Her English was in many instances hard to understand due to a heavy Hungarian accent and strange English pronunciation. There were around 40 people on the tour, which was clearly too many. There were tours in several languages conducted at one time, which resulted in eg. two goups of visitors being at the main concert hall at the same time making it even more difficult to hear and understand the guide.All in all, the opera is very impressive and beatifully restored and decorated. However, the guided tour was not very rewarding and at the price of 2900 HUF/person for a 45 minute tour on the above conditions, it seems a little steep. Add to that that you will need to buy an addiotional 'photo ticket' if you want to be able to take pictures inside the opera!"

Rarely do you get big stars here-- simply unaffordable. But solid, thoughtful, engaging productions. Titles are now in both Hungarian snd English. I buy tickets months in advance and go to every production available when i am here. This time my 17 tickets cost me about $200.

They should be proud of this treasure that they have.We went to the matinee of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci on a Sunday. The performances were heartfelt and moving. The cast was splendid and had you engaged in their interactions and the story of both. The audience so appreciated the performance there were numerous curtain calls for both productions.We got our tickets late and had seats stage right thinking it would be an obscured view but we were in the second row, could see everything and were happy with the seats. Once again I will say the tickets were a fraction of the cost of a live Opera in the states.If you are traveling here and get the opportunity to see an Opera, it will be something that you will never forget."

As others have said, the cost of tickets is very reasonable. We couldn't find much information about dress code, but I would say a short but nice dress for women is fine and men can wear business casual. I saw men both with and without a jacket. Of course, if you want to get dressed up go for it. There will be others very dressed up too."

Was my first opera (bucket list item I wanted to experience). I must admit the big break between the 3 parts really turned the evening into an slightly arduous 3 hour outing. FYI even though in Italian - there is a video teleprompter above the stage in English and Hungarian. Starts promptly at 7pm- no delays. Dress code is between smart casual and gowns- do what feels right for your evening. Seats are a bit uncomfortable. Best seats are the first floor section or rows 1 or 2 of the second level. I'm not sure if the 3rd or 4th level would make any sense to experience. Street Trolley can be used for transportation. We bought tickets very reasonably through their web site very last minute, so my group say apart - which really didn't matter much at all. Price is amazingly reasonable by American standards."

We were able to buy box tickets just before the event even though the event was nearly sold out (and the seats were well worth the reasonable price), and the event was truly spectacular. The evening consisted of a shorter (compressed) opera (which was part of the first opera performed when the operahouse opened in 1884), then a film celebrating the history of the opera and various performers, a short choral performance, and finally, an incredible and energetic premiere of a modern dance set by Robert Norris (which was full of movement and African beats, and had a bit of humor as well). I absolutely loved the breathtaking dance portion and would gladly pay to see the performance again. The dancers truly electrified the audience. I should also say that the opera performance was also first rate and featured spectacular sets and costumes. Another fun part of the evening was that there were 100-150 people in period costumes (circa 1884), and they appeared to be together from a local music high school or college academy. They were certainly having fun, and we truly enjoyed this window into Hungarian culture. After the concert, fireworks lit the sky above the opera house. Again, the performances were professional and top-notch, and what value with the ticket prices as they are! The venue itself is also incredibly beautiful, and you can just feel the history in the building. I saw that some reviewers have had negative experiences when just doing a tour or a short \"mini-concert,\" but I can say that coming for a full-length performance is a very different experience. If you are in Budapest for even just one night, it is worth it to buy a ticket for a full-length performance here. Truly amazing experience and wish we could go back for another opera or dance experience."

Third floor box seats, near center, second row - a little over $17 USD. The opera house was classy in the gilded style of other famous European venues. The acoustics were fantastic, performance amazing - two piano encores after the Rachmaninoff. My recommendation is splurge for front row of box seats or orchestra rows as we had an obstructed view and stood through much of the concert to watch the players. Balcony is very high, yet good views, especially first row. Concert lasted 2.5 hours, and we (two women) felt totally safe walking .75 miles back to our apartment."

            "review": "Spectacular elegance. The staggering Hungarian State Opera House is a richly decorated building in neo-Renaissance style with numerous baroque elements featuring on the fa\u00e7ade and it's equally opulent interiors, located in the very heart of Budapest, in Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue, one of the most beautiful boulevards in the world. The building was originally known as the Hungarian Royal Opera House and is considered the masterpiece of architect Mikl\u00f3s Ybl, a major figure in 19th century Hungarian architecture. Construction was co-funded by the City of Budapest and the Emperor Franz-Joseph, and the Opera House opened to the public on the 27 September 1884.Numerous important opera-singers and musicians have since performed there, \u1f18va Marton made her d\u00e9bout in 1968, followed by Sylvia Sass in 1971 who also made her first professional operatic appearance on it's stage; the composer Gustav Mahler was the Opera's Chief Conductor for four years (1887 -1891) and Otto Klemperer, one of the leading conductors of the 20th century, has been it's music director from 1947 to 1950.Although it is not one of the largest Opera Houses, it had the advantage of surviving the horrors of World War II and of emerging unscathed through the vicissitudes of the Communistic Era. As years went by though there was the immediate need for a series of extensive renovation works which began in 1980 and lasted for about four years, making thus the reopening on the 27th of September 1984 to coincide with the exact centenary of the Opera House. In consequence, although it completely adheres to the typical layout of a traditional 19th century Opera House, visitors nowadays may admire a completely and masterfully renovated perfectly functional Opera House. From the richly ornate Entrance Hall one is guided over a very grand sweeping staircase to a series of vast grandiose public spaces which provide the opportunity for people to mix socially and enjoy a glass of champagne during intervals. The auditorium is magnificent in appearance and semicircular in shape, with an approximate capacity of about 1,260 and according to entirely unsubstantiated rumours -at least hitherto not supported by any scientific evidence- boasts the third best acoustics in Europe after La Scala and the Palais Garnier in Paris. A three-storey high sumptuously decorated series of tiers of boxes fully occupy the sides of the horseshoe shaped auditorium, culminating in the very imposing ex- Royal Box which is located at it's very centre, presently offering the best view towards the large stage and the orchestra pit to the President of the Hungarian Republic and to visiting Heads of States. It is richly decorated with full-sized gilded sculptures on pedestals representing the personifications of the four operatic voices: soprano, alto, tenor and bass.A glittering giant bronze chandelier weighting more than three tons is suspended over the middle of the auditorium. Young children and bored members of the audience usually spend long periods of time calculating what damage would ensue if the chandelier accidentally happened to fall on unsuspected members of the audience. It illuminates a beautifully executed rather populous fresco by the German-Hungarian painter K\u00e1roly Lotz, entirely inspired by Greek mythology and depicting an apotheosis of the god Apollo.Tours take place daily and twice, at 15.00 and 16.00 and are given in English, Spanish, French, Italian and German; all languages start and end at the same time.Tours in Japanese are given on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday and each Sunday there are also tours in Hungarian. Each tour lasts for about 45 minutes. Tickets can be bought directly at the Opera Shop, to the right of the entrance hall, immediately upon entering through the main entrance of the building.English speaking visitors are usually the most numerous, so if you master any other of the languages in offer, do opt going for a tour in this other language, it's so incredibly less crowded which makes guides naturally much more relaxed and your experience much more pleasurable.At the end of every tour, visitors may decide staying behind and listening to a \"mini recital\" of about 5 additional minutes, which includes two arias performed by a professional opera singer from the Opera House. This recital takes place in the Opera's very ornate Main Foyer and I would most warmly recommend it, not only because it costs a mere extra \u00a32 to your original Adults Opera Tour Ticket, which is about \u00a311 per person, but because it is the perfect musical ending to an Opera House tour.At the end of our visit a very beautiful lady commenced singing \"Oh mio babbino caro\" from Puccini's Gianni Schicchi, which was followed by a rendition of the \"Brindisi\" from Verdi's La Traviata. She was not Maria Callas but her interpretation was very theatrical and she had charm, grace and musicality in her performance.If you are not lucky enough as to assist at a live opera performance, then this very professionally organised and equally well operated tour is the next best thing to explore this absolutely outstanding building."

There were many, many others waiting for the English tour so we decided to wait for the next one at 4.30pm which turned out to be just as crowded. Our guide tried her best but there were so many other tours at the same time in English, Italian and French and we were all in the same place at the same time, everyone competing for space, the guides all trying to be heard over each other that it was a waste of time. It's a lovely building and would have been worth seeing if it had been better organised - it took about 35 minutes and was not value for money. Unfortunately that's not the point as we would have liked to see more."

Tours get very crowded and noisy as each guide has to out shout the others if they are too close to each other. Why they cannot have different timings for different languages, I don't know. The majority of visitors are those who have coupons from other tourist services such as the hop on hop off bus tours so look for these coupons if you want a discount as the standard pricing is expensive and you have to pay extra to be able to take photos, and extra too to listen to a mini concert after the tour. It would be better to buy tickets to a performance if you can instead of taking the tour as you could see the best parts of the building without being on tour.The guide I had was a young girl who was spending so much energy shouting loudly one almost pitied her but her vocal cords were in good condition and she lasted the distance."

There was a large number of people touring the day we were there so they broke us up into 5 or 6 different, smaller groups, some based on language, but really didn't have much of a plan for the logistics of getting all of our groups through. The tour guide was ok, and told a few good stories but I would have hoped for more. Also, we didn't see anything backstage (as we had in Vienna). They also charged extra to take photos, which I didn't like. At the end they offered a 'mini-concert' for 2.5 eur each, which we thought might be a good chance to hear the hall's celebrated acoustics, except for that the mini-concert wasn't even in the auditorium, it was in one of the lobbies. It consisted of two arias sung by a a singer who was way past her prime so this was very disappointing"

Beautiful opera house based on the one in Vienna. Production was a bit quirky and there were a few costume malfunctions but the singing was good and we didn't feel too out of place in the best of our tourist clothes! Opera was in German of course but well surtitled in English (and Hungarian if you're capable!).Watch that you don't get rear box seats as we did as you will have to stand up to see over the folks in front of you. In all a great evening out and recommended."

To start with it costs 3000 HUF to go on the tour, and an additional 500 HUF just to take photos. Already here we should've known we were in for a sham.The building was absolutely packed with tours and if we weren't bumping into the group in front of us, we were being bumped into from behind. Our guide looked more at this wristwatch than he did at us, and there was no time to really stop and take in any of the myriad of the details in the opera house.If you want to see the opera house in Budapest, go and see an actual opera. But don't do the tour, it is absolutely awful."

I thought that was great, as too many times I've been on tours in too large a group and you can't see or hear what the tour guide is saying. The tour guide's English was very good and I could easily understand what was being said. The theatre, or at least what we saw of it, was much like any other theatre. I have been to many theatres in London and felt this was no different. As a paid tour, I was hoping to see something not generally open to the public. Although, maybe the area at the top of the royal staircase is not generally open. I would like to have seen some of backstage and how the theatre works. I am sure that all the information and photos on the tour could easily be found on the internet. Maybe I'm just hard to please, after visiting the Baroque theatre in Cesky Krumlov, which was incredible!"

The mini concert is held in an intermission room, not the main auditorium, and it is one performer singing a few songs.

We booked our seats in one of the upper circle level boxes almost two months in advance. The booking process was very easy: we went to the Opera House's website, which redirected us to Jegymester.hu. You can choose your seats and pay with a credit card. The site charges a very reasonable commission (about a euro or less per ticket). We printed out our tickets and took them to the Opera House on the night of the performance. Our seats were excellent and the price was very reasonable (9,500 HUF per ticket, including commission). Book in advance if you want to get good seats! One small tip: before attending the performance, we stopped for tea and pastries at the Book Cafe (Lotz Terem). It is located on the second floor of the \"Alexandra\" book store (Andrassy ut 39). The bookstore (and the cafe) are a 4-5 min walk from the Opera House. The cafe is a popular spot in the afternoon, so plan for some extra time not to be late for the opera.

Also, the mini concert didn't take place in the theater but in one of the refreshment areas.

I figured my first opera might as well take place in one of the most renown performance halls in Europe. I'm not an opera-aficionado, so my review is limited. The opera was enjoyable, if only for the aura it presented--sitting in a historic art relic. And if I remember correctly, the price was right, especially when compared to a Paris or London show. The beauty of the house is worthy of admiration alone, and definitely a must-see while you're in the city. My second visit to this beautiful city was in April this year and while I didn't take in a show, a peer and I went into the house, and again, I was amazed at its architecture, intricate design and overall exquisite interior. I highly recommend stopping here while you're in this city."

Not only that, the performers are top level artists that you will be drawn completely into their act. However, I recommend that you do your homework or research before you go to a performance. We saw \"Elektra\" by Richard Stauss. It was fantastic but we read up on the story and also listened to the music before we went. So it was easy for us to understand what was being sung. However the Hungarian Opera House provides a translation of the plot so you can read while you are listening to the performers. In this case, it is better to sit up higher because the translation is shown at the upper part of the stage. It was difficult to read for us because we sat at the bottom floor, center in front of the orchestra. If you have problems sitting on a wooden chair of a couple of hours, I recommend you bring a coushion. Tickets are more affordable than in other large European cities so I really recommend a night at the opera if you are in Budapest!"

There are nice traditional sandwiches at the bar during intermissions, plus drinks. But the building is also interesting historically and technically. It was built in the late 19th c. with \"air conditioning\" of a kind...I won't give away the secret. Also saved from total destruction during WW II by a miracle.

I read up on the opera when I got home and found out it's \"modernist\" so I will try another opera in the future but will make sure it's the traditional one and I may enjoy it a bit more.

Opulent would be the better word here. Get there 20 minutes early and snap a few photos. There are no breaks in this opera, so grab a wine before the opera begins. Seats? Well, if you love box seats...which I do...get the first row in them. You will be sad if you sit behind someone in the box as many have obstructed views. Stay out of the uppermost seating...floor seats look good at this point. Dress? No tuxedo in sight...slacks and dress shirt...blazers and the odd tie were the norm. Ladies, dresses is all I saw.

When you purchase your tickets, ask for the additional ticket that allows photography (yes, there is another fee).

It is probably advisable to book tickets in advance for cheaper seats, however, no complaints as we paid an average price (around 15-20 pounds) for a show on the next day and got seats in an almost-private stall above the orchestra. The staff at the ticket office were very helpful and patient both times round. The building itself is fantastic (probably the prettiest opera house I have been in), and the show we saw ('La Sylphide' with a great pre-show of adrenaline-filled 'Troy') was really good. Great dancing, really good costumes and absolutely stunning stage setting scenery. If you can get on this show (it opened at the beginning of May): go!!"

The tour also visited the main bar and smoking galleries where you have the option to hear two arias by one of the singers.

I had a fantastic evening at the Opera House with my partner last June - it's one of those places that no matter what performance you go to see, you can only be impressed by the beauty of the building both inside and out. We saw a ballet of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, which admittedly was probably geared more towards children, but it was so charming we didn't mind. I would recommend hiring seats in a box - it was the equivalent of about \u00a317 per person (a fraction of what you'd pay in the UK), and well worth it, giving great views of the stage and a bit of privacy. There are seats in the stalls that are the equivalent of a few pounds too. Note that in the boxes, there are four seats, so if you want it to yourself you will have to hire them all.At the intermission, everyone went out onto a terraced area, ate l\u00e1ngos and drank Tokaji wine - - two Hungarian specialities I highly recommend! Despite the setting, the atmosphere was relaxed and nowhere near as stiff as I had feared. Perhaps because it was an earlier show (starting at 6) and geared towards children, people were dressed in a mix of casual and smart clothing - nothing too formal.Staff at the Opera House were polite and professional. Not all spoke English, but knew enough to be able to direct us to where we were sitting.I would highly recommend a visit to the Opera House for the experience alone."

So a visit to The Opera House in Budapest is a wonderful treat. We\u2019ve seen several ballets here now (we arrange out visits to Budapest to coincide with the ballet season) and each visit has been a delight.The standard of performance is excellent and the venue is superb. We \u201csplash\u201d out on a balcony box and have a wonderful view and sound experience.At the interval make you way to the bar area, where you can also purchase food, and then head out onto the balcony. It\u2019s lovely to stand on the large balcony, champagne in hand, looking down on the evening street and up at the classical architecture of the building.Thankfully we are never alone in taking photos of the auditorium, staircases, bar etc during the intermission and the staff have always been really friendly and happy to take a photo of you. Yes, I know it\u2019s a touristy thing to do but whilst this is a stunning classical venue it\u2019s not as stuffy as most. Saying that, people do tend to dress up more than at Covent Garden which is now quite casual. So don\u2019t be surprised to see evening gowns and dinner jackets being worn. But as long as you\u2019re smartly dressed you won\u2019t feel out of place.At Christmas you have the added delight of the giant Christmas trees inside & outside of the Opera House. The outside one is enormous and has giant gingerbread decorations hanging from it. There\u2019s also a snow-clad hut and the two glass display cabinets on the pavement outside have mannequins of characters from the Nutcracker in them. I understand there are guided tours of the building, and it would be worth going on one to see the beautiful decoration inside, but if you like ballet or opera then don\u2019t miss an evening here. You won\u2019t regret it."

We bought tickets for Tosca before we went to Hungary using the very efficient Jegymester website and had excellent seats. Although these seats looked a little basic and uncomfortable they were fine. They do not allow patrons to enter until about twenty minutes before curtain up, consequently the crush in the entrance foyer is uncomfortable. Cloakroom facilities (400 HUF) were very good and efficient and put Covent Garden and the Met to shame. Programmes (1,000HUF), in Hungarian and English, were interesting and informative. As for the performance there were many positives. The orchestra was good as were the acoustics. The sets were also good. The singing, with the notable exception of Scarpia (K\u00e1lm\u00e1ndi Mih\u00e1ly), was second rate in the extreme and it was sad to hear much loved arias not receiving the treatment they deserved. The 'Te Deum' at the end of Act 1 was such a disappointment, with the chorus singing off stage they could hardly be heard. Such a stirring end to an act became a whimper. Having said that, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would definite recommend an evening at the opera. Our seats in the orchestra stall cost just 11,500 HUF. Where else will you find an opera bargain like that?"

Far too few women's toilets for such a large seating area when we got there!But the most disappointing part was when we took our seats in the second row of balcony, and could not see the front half of the stage at all. As the piano was placed there, we could see nothing. We're used to venues like the Albert Hall and Covent Garden which also have high, cheaper seats, but unless the seats are sold as 'impeded view' of similar, you can at least see the stage. It certainly had the gilded interior of so many London West End Victorian theatres... but was not very user friendly.All that said, the essentially Hungarian audience seemed content (though we never found a programme that told us what pieces we were listening to or who was performing) so perhaps our expectations were too high.... and its drawbacks may not worry other visitors.We always try to take in a music event when visiting a new city\u2014Barcelona and Prague, for example, were wonderful.

The seats were fine, if a little hard, with good leg room, but the rows weren't very well staggered and the floor rake was very gradual so you could easily end up sitting directly behind someone tall who could ruin your view. Boxes looked much better but bear in mind they have rear seats which are on the same level as the front ones so again you may not see much unless you're prepared to stand through the whole show. Basically, go on the website and look at the seat prices, they will tell you everything about the quality of that seat - as far as I could tell there are no \"bargain\" seats here.At the interval we were able to buy drinks from one of the four bars in the upstairs room and then walk out onto the balcony overlooking Andrassy Ut.The ballet itself was excellent in every way.If you're not visiting to see a show, you will need to book a tour to see most of the building because casual visitors can only see the main foyer, but I thoroughly recommend even doing just that if you're anywhere nearby, it really is a marvellous building."

There are two alternatives ..One is to take a guided tour which happens once or twice a day or better still book a performance and please 'dress' for the occasion..This elegant and stately lady deserves no less than you return the compliment of her elegance and utterly stunning decor...In the summer during the interval , a glass of champagne on the terrace overlooking the grand Andrassy Street is a memorable moment..There is a Metro station No.1 ''Opera' or a casual walk past elegant shops and restaurants can too be a pleasure....Before, if you have time ,a cocktail at the 'Callas' bar next door is a good beginning..I had the good fortune to be a guest in the box overlooking the stage and sneaked in quite illegally a bottle of champagne and glasses which added to the thrill..but box,stall, balcony or 'Gods'...Take in this experience.."

Logistics: Tours are at 3 and 4pm, they divide you into groups by language and take you to several areas including the main auditorium, the Royal Bar, and the smoking corridor. The guides are knowledgeable.Not surprisingly, our English tour was quite crowded, but the theater is large and the guides allow plenty of time for photos and questions. We paid about 500 HUF (which is about 2 dollars) extra to see a performance of 2 arias in the Royal Bar following the tour. I am sure it was an understudy who performed for us, but regardless, it was AMAZING. When a beautiful soprano performs Mio Babbino Caro in such a setting, it really takes your breath away! Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates music and/or opera!"

We are not opera buffs, but decided we could either take a tour of The State Opera House, or alternatively actually attend a performance and soak up the atmosphere. There are guided tours between 3 and 4 o'clock we believe, but we chose to enjoy a performance at the State Opera House. Firstly, the building will not disappoint, even externally the decoration is truly magnificent and the interior of the building is most certainly worth a visit. Sitting inside our gilded box on the fourth level we had an excellent view of the stage although we felt sorry for the three people who sat behind us as their view must have been quite restricted. All the seats are allocated, so perhaps they paid less than we had done for our front seats. Before the performance we simply marvelled at the beauty of this fabulous building, our camera never stopped clicking. During the performance photography is not allowed! The performance of \"The Flying Dutchman\" was well received and the total experience was one we will treasure. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the seats are somewhat uncomfortable, but we felt the experience was well worth both the reasonable cost and the temporary discomfort."

The Hungarian State Opera House is a Neo-Renaissance masterpiece, built by Hungary's finest architect - Miklos Ybl in 1884. Europe has its share of fabulous opera houses and this is certainly up there with the best of them. The outside of the State Opera House is nice but its the interior that you will long remember after visiting. The entrance area, red carpeted staircase and ornate decorated foyer are bound to impress. Then you enter the lovely auditorium, with gilded box seating, attractive stage and a beautiful ceiling fresco and chandelier. The box seating area is well decorated and makes an enjoyable place to watch an opera or ballet. Do have a look at the impressive Royal Box for the heavy gilding and statues as well. During our recent visit, we watched the Taming of the Shrew ballet and found it to be a good performance. The costumes were delightful and the ballet was entertaining to watch. Tickets were purchased directly through the State Opera website and tickets printed at home. Compared to attending ballet and opera elsewhere in Europe the price for box seats was very affordable. Overall, we quite enjoyed the ballet seen at the Hungarian State Opera House and we'd happily attend another ballet or opera performance here in the future. This is a world class venue providing very reasonably priced performing arts for visitors to see in Budapest."

The whole place is gorgeous and quite breathtaking. Even when you sit at literally the cheapseats...views and sound is great. I suggest going there when its not so full. Because the room for your knees is quite tight if you are over 6'2ft or 187 cm like me.The best is the prices. At 600ft thats less than 2\u20ac for tockets. before the show...enter the building thru the main entrance...enjoy the grandeur of the opera builing. For your seats you need to enter via the side entrance for a lengthy 6 stair climb to the top.best cheap seats is right on the balcony..if you sit behind the view could be somewhat restricted,This place is much better than the opera in Prague. It ;looks so grand and beuatifull. A must vist IMHO when you come to Budapest. Even if you dont like opera. An oepra is splitin 3 parts and we went away after the 2nd intermission."

Since we had purchased on-line tickets for the Parliament, we thought it would be a great idea to experience opera at the Opera House rather than pay for the guided tour. Best decision: we got orchestra seat tickets for about 25% the cost of tickets back in the States and saw Janacek's JENUFA. We had time to wander throughout the building before curtain rising and during the two intermissions. It was interesting to hear the opera in its native Czech language and to see supertitles in Hungarian rather than English. Good thing we knew the plot! The opera was wonderful and the choreography superb. We were hoping to get tickets to Tosca but unfortunately was sold out.

The vaulted, gilded ceiling in the foyer is covered in amazing murals, with marble columns at every turn, and chandeliers galore especially above the sweeping staircase (some weighing over 2 tons) , which give the whole opera house a feeling of opulence and grandeur. The theatre itself is awe inspiring. Two tips, too late we noticed the hop on/off bus offers a 20% discount, which we bought the next day and... only about half the people on our tour bought the right to take photographs (which was not enforced) therefore everyone happily snapped continuously,having paid or not."

The opera boxes are elegantly lined in reds and golds, and make you feel like royalty while watching the opera. We have been to La Scala in Milan, and although the Hungarian State Opera doesn't have quite the reputation that La Scala does, it is a beautiful and magnificent opera house well worth visiting to listen to an opera or concert. They also have a nice lounge area where you can get a glass of wine or beer before the show and during intermission."

One the most beautiful shows of the season, a must to see performance. Having a separate box gave us the convenience of hanging our coats directly next to us. We had a direct access to the long area for refreshments between the scenes. Rest room was just in front of our door and didn't had to wait in any line. Parking is a bit hectic around the opera, so would suggest to take a taxi or arrive 30 min prior the show. Taxis are available just in front of the entrance after the show or the underground which stopped exactly at the entrance (gavel you an amazing oldies feeling to use it)."

We saw La Boheme which was very poor. The actors needed to come to the front of the stage to sing, which meant they were standing in a line. This works for some parts but is ridiculous when the couple are falling in love but not looking at each other. Acts 2 and 3 were confused and the Italian was not particularly good. In contrast the music was excellant. Certainly worth a visit when in Budapest."

In the evening I saw La Boheme and it was also excellent. At that time I sat in a box and the view was extremely good. Acting, singing, music and sets were all excellent for this performance.

The tour lasted 40 minutes and the performance lasted 10 minutes or so. We were out easily in under an hour as there were rehearsals due to take place for that evening's performance. 2 guides divided up the English-speaking group as we were by far the biggest tour group. We crisscrossed around the building to avoid bumping into and overhearing the German, French, Chinese tours- a feat in itself! The info we were given was very interesting and informative but the highlight was the mini performance at the end. It was a moving experience to be standing 4/5 feet from an opera singer who projected her voice as if she were on stage performing to a large crowd. At one point she held an empty wine glass in her hand as she sang. I was half expecting it to shatter but it didn't! Very memorable and special"

The subtitles were in hungarian so make sure you read the synopsis a few times beforehand. The opera is broken down into four acts with a 20 minutes intermission after act two. Like normal, there are long queues in the ladies toilets so allow yourself plenty of time or see my tip. Photos and videos are permitted inside but not during the performance. A great cultural experience.

Sitting high allowed us a great view of the stage as well as a closeup of the frescoed ceiling, crystal chandelier, and other adornments. We were allowed to take photos until the show started for no extra fee on both the grand red carpeted staircases and inside the house. No coat check was required as there are coat hooks inside the boxes. There are bathrooms just for the box seats in the hallway. Besides the exquisite classical guitar playing by Csaki Andres (truly amazing), one of our favorite parts was joining the synchronized clapping to invite encores. And ending with a spirited encore of Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies was a wonderful surprise. Why spend money on a limited tour when you can take in a show. Tickets on the floor or in the balcony are often less than the tour price."

At 6pm on Sat. 7th Dec., apx. 35GBP each in stalls row 5, which I think is a very reasonable price all things considered. Have some small change for the cloak room. There are two issues here: one is the building itself and its d\u00e9cor, the other-the performance. On both counts outstanding!The Budapest Opera House is a gem. I would say it was built in an eclectic style; with gilded plasterwork everywhere, marble and frescoes it at times resembles the inside of St.Mark\u2019s Basilica in Venice. It is not a very big or spacious edifice but full of nooks and crannies, impressive staircase and foyer where one can buy drinks and snacks between acts. It is well worth a visit on its own but seeing it in its full glory at the time of the performance, with crowds having great time was a joy not to be missed.I would not miss the ballet for a world either. I am not an art critic yet I have seen quite a few ballets in my life and this performance surely must count as one of the best. The quality of the dancers, the rich scenography, the music was first class. What a wonderful night out around Christmas time! If I were to criticize anything it would be that the seats are not padded enough to my liking, in which-my wife reminds me-it is not unlike in the La Scala. Perhaps, like in a church your mind is meant thus to be directed to loftier, spiritual or artistic matters? It was an unforgettable evening completed with a light supper nearby and a leisurely walk back to the hotel."

I'm pleased that they allowed photography before the curtains went up. I managed some great shots with my iPhone but it could not capture the classic beauty of the grandeur.The show itself was amazing, my very first opera, and I enjoyed it. I did find however when the actors were taking bows at the end of each act just how unhappy they are. Maybe they're nervous excited but a smile wouldn't hurt!

It is a gorgeous building, extremely ornate and a brilliant setting for an opera. The show was really good and an excellent introduction to opera. Well staged and beautifully sung.

But I have to say that the portal for the Hungarian State Opera is really user-friendly. And the most amazing thing is what you pay at check out. For a few minutes, I thought I only paid for the booking charges ... . You don't get to watch quality opera for \u20ac27 anywhere in the world. This time round I watched La Traviata. As others have noticed, the acoustics is excellent and the interior is beautiful and charming. The accompanying orchestra is just superb. The only minor complaint I have is that the production and staging is very staid and not at all innovative. I feel like I am watching a recording from the 60s but you can't fault anyone technically for their singing except - maybe for the poor Italian diction of 'Violetta'. (I'm somewhat finicky though.) So, the music and the singing is splendid if you love opera. Overall, the HSO is a must for opera lovers. It is by far, the most inspiring few hours I spent in Budapest. Tips: 1. Don't worry too much about the seating - it is a very small theatre and even the seats at the far back of the stall or circle are good. 2. The surtitles are in Hungarian, so it is useful if you understand the language the opera is sung in or if you are familiar with the piece. "

The intricate woodwork in the lesser rooms was impressive but this left too little time in the auditorium - especially as we had bought a photo licence ticket.We did the tour on a Monday afternoon and mistakenly thought the 3pm tour on a non-performance day would be fairly leisurely but it lasted only 50 minutes - presumably in time for the guides to prepare for the 4pm show - maybe that one would have been a little less rushed.The building is stunning and overall the rather expensive tour is worth doing."

At the first intermezzo the bartender had the snacks and drinks we ordered just before the opera started ready on a table with a silver platter. After the performance, during the curtain call the audience began clapping in unison, faster and faster, until they broke back into regular clapping. We were not sure if this was a Hungarian tradition or if this was meant to be a united compliment by the audience. Either way, it was a wonderful way to end the performance.

I\u2019m no opera buff, I leave that to hubby, but we did manage a tour which was about an hour & after all you get a \u2018mini opera\u2019 [about 5-10 minutes of small performance from a singer, ours was male & pretty amusing, you simply stand around in the foyer & watch until they usher you out]. The tour guide was young but knowledgeable & you are shown around various parts of the opera house in a well oiled operated. It is a lovely place & we elected to not see the show as it was almost 4 hours & my hubby was not sure I\u2019d have the stamina. But compared to Vienna & Paris the shows here seem very affordable & this is an opera house which matches the best of them."

It isn't as big as the state opera in Prague but nevertheless I think it was even more beautiful.The showroom in which the opera took place was quite big and very impressive!! The opera itself was fantastic! I haven't seen lots of operas so I can just tell you my personal impression, but I was enchanted! The seats were a little too hard though after 2 hours an a half, but you cannot miss a spectacle in the opera if you visit Budapest and if you like this kind of spectacle!"

Yes it is a mini edition of the other opera house and the funding came mainly through the same royal purse. The tour was more expensive than Vienna, the decor similar, the tour shorter and more hurried, and we didn't get to see backstage in this case. We did pay an extra premium for a mini-concert lasting 10 minutes officially - 2 arias, very well sung - but over in 5 minutes.Probably more entertaining than all those dusty museums, but there's a Caravaggio exhibition on currently till early next year. That would have been the better bet."

The opera house is beautiful and if you are not interested in seeing an opera you can join a tour of the opera house in the afternoon at 3.00 or 4.00 p.m. My wife and I have been fortunate in visiting many opera houses in Europe and have rarely visited a more beautiful opera house. I wish I could say the same for the performance of La Traviata that we saw. The soprano climbed to the top notes and the baritone put in a workmanlike performance without any projection or passion. The saving grace was the orchestra which was superb led by a world class conductor. We left after the 7th curtain call and the audience were still whistling & cheering. All I can say is that if the Hugarians think this is a top class performance, they should get out more."

One of our treats was a visit to the State Opera House to see the National Ballet Company in a ballet about a hungarian artist, Mih\u00e1ly Munk\u00e1csy.The Opera House is an absolute gem, and has retained all its original features, without being compromised to offer the uneccessary frills and furbelows demanded by a modern mimsy audience. I am disabled, and have mobility problems, but I would not want to see one part of this beautiful building altered to accomodate lifts or escalators. We booked our tickets online, and were dealt with speedily and efficiently, with helpful courteous staff on hand at every turn to assist us to our seats, two seats in a shared box, next to the Royal Box, for just \u00a312.00 each. What a bargain, the box was fine, we arranged our seats to afford an excxellent view, and the performance was first class. In a building of this size and grandeur, I was amazed at how well maintained and clean the building was, obviously well loved by both staff and public alike, and extremely well supported. During the first interval, we had wine in the bar, with access to the grand balcony overlooking Andrassy Utca, what a treat! For those with limited views, large screen TVs were provided on each side of the proscenium, so the needs of the audience have been considered, but not at the expense of the superb original building. Highly recommended, but the best way to see any such venue is during a live performance, it is as though the whole building comes alive."

The performance of La Traviata my girlfriend and I saw didn't quite measure up to operas we'd seen at The Met, but it was still very good opera in a world-class theater. Apparently the acoustics are among the best of any opera house in the world, and I thought they lived up to their reputation. As the other reviews point out, tours for the opera house are much more expensive than watching a show from the third floor. The tickets we bought were about 7 dollars each, and we were perfectly happy with our seats. If you're wondering whether to opt for the absolute cheapest tickets, I'd suggest paying a little extra so you're not sitting in the back rows of the canopy sides. Those seemed like the only seats in the house where the stage might not be clearly visible.It's also worth noting that checking your coat into the cloakroom is mandatory, so be sure to bring around 400 HUF in change."

I was hesitant to try taking my small kids to the opera but finally decided that if we could get cheap-ish seats it would be worth an attempt even if we had to leave early. I am so glad we stopped in to ask if there were inexpensive seats left one night because we scored 4 seats together, facing the stage, on the 3rd (highest) tier. I had heard the cheap seats all have views facing away from the stage or are behind other seats without any lift so you can't see anything, but we had a really good view for 6,000 florints total. (about $30) I was annoyed by the extra coatroom fee (non optional) as it was not specified ahead of time (what if I wasn't carrying cash at the time?) but it wasn't too exorbitant, I just don't see why they don't add it to the ticket price automatically. I was nervous that the kids would bother other people sitting around us but they managed to be quiet and still until the very end of act 2 of La Traviata. (I spent most of the time nursing the youngest and holding the others hand to remind them not to bother anyone.) We left at the second intermission before they got too bored to behave nicely. The music was spectacular and the sets and costumes were very well done. I was quite disappointed to leave early but wanted to keep the whole thing fun for the kids (so they'll want to return in future!) and not make the evening unpleasant for other fans. Many people have said the seats are uncomfortable but they seemed fine to me, just not uber padded. There is a thin velvet pad over a old fashioned wooden theater seat. The arm rests are even at a comfortable height for supporting an elbow while nursing. ;-)"

We splashed out the next night ( we were on holiday!!) and went to the Verdi Gala. We just did this on the last moment not expecting to get in, but the box offce in the theatre could not have been more friendly. Again we got great tickets at far better value than in the UK. My wife likes the opera, and we have been to a number of Eastern European opera houses and they represent good value for money compared with UK rip off prices. I booked for Tannhauser on line here in the UK, and that again was straightforward and easy. They have a great line up of productions here, so if you like classical music, ballet or opera then do not miss this!!Dr Malc"

It has withstood the wars, the times, of 130 years, and the major transitions from being barely maintained (during the Communist Era) to the grandeur of the Emperor of Austria-Hungary through to the newest regime in control of government. We thoroughly enjoyed the delightful seating in color and arrangement, the fantastic control of sound and fury form the instruments, and also the spectacle of entrance in the great hall. Many USA citizens of Hungarian decent, who fled before and during World War II and also the 1956 revolution, came from this area of the city. This included (Hollywood Movie Stars) the famous three Gabor sisters and also Madame Rozsi Pogany of cosmetics' fame in the USA. You must do whjat we did, walk from the Basilica to the entrance to Andrassy Utca and walk up this fantastic street to the Opera House, seeing all of the shops and thinking you are in the 1870s to the 1920s."

We went to see Giselle and took a couple of pictures with our mobile just before the show started (everybody else was doing the same). On the intermission the usher came to me speaking Hungarian; he changed to English as he realized I could not understand and asked me to delete the pictures I took, once it was forbidden. I apologized, I did not know it was forbidden and haven't seen any sign about that. He made me feel like a criminal. I opened my phone and asked him which ones he wanted me to delete. I had several pictures from the building and din't know what was allowed or not.That didn't make him behave in a more pleasant way, and we left the play at that point.I guess there are always many ways to say the same thing and transmit the same message.Despite his youth I could sense some soviet authoritarianism in his manners.

The tour guides seemed terribly disorganized. There were a lot of disgruntled tourists. They had too many people in a group and the groups were so close to each other all speaking different languages it was very distracting since you could hear the guide next to you over your guide. Our guide had a voice that did not project, you had to stand right next to her to hear her. We paid for a mini concert, what a joke, the singer sang two songs to us in the lobby while we were standing and left. Do not pay for a mini concert you won't get any value. The singer was good but we didn't get to sit down."

Unfortunately this meant the stage was about 10cm away, with no leg room and hard seating. The building was packed, which meant queues for the toilets. There was nowhere to get a drink, even water - people were drinking from the taps in the washbasins of the toilets - not a good image.The music was good, but we bailed after the first part of the performance as it was just too uncomfortable to be there."

During the tour however we found that not everyone taking pictures had bought the extra ticket, but nothing was being done to prevent them taking pictures. For us, the added 50 forints were a waste of money.The mini-concert we got at the end was fun to do.

We saw the Brothers Karamazov Ballet in October 2012. The detailing almost overwhelmed the senses, but was exactly what we wanted from our visit to an old European opera house.Despite the grandeur, the venue felt intimate. Our box seats were spacious, but cozy. It didn't look like their was a bad seat in the house. The rows of box seats along the sides and rear allowed for lots of additional seating without the depth endemic to American theater balconies.We found it easy to get good seats on short notice. We had not planned ahead, but bought tickets online two days before the show, at a very reasonable price. The theater was full, which demonstrates their ability to keep prices in check with demand.The ballet was wonderfully performed. The dancer's grace impressed us both. The ballet itself was very contemporary and filled with action. The narrative portions were translated into English on the screen above the stage, which suited us perfectly.The not so goodWe expected a more romantic ballet. That was mostly our fault for not being in touch with the ballet community. At times, the ballet was violent and masculine. Great for half our group, but not so great for the other half.After visiting London theater, we missed the ice cream in being served in the aisles. Hardly a serious complaint, but a subtle difference in attitude between the theaters.The final wordGo! It was a great experience. We highly recommend seeing at least one show on your trip to Budapest!"

In our view, it was considerably more impressive than the (very good) Vienna State Opera - the opulent interior is very well maintained and every room we visited oozed luxury...

Both me and my partner (who only recently 'discovered' ballet) were in a state of awe after the third act and I can say that this was one of the most over-whelming and best experiences of my life (so far). It made such an impression that we now actively look for new tickets to Budapest to see other ballets.

Luckily there was no one sitting in front of me so I hopped into the front row. Great view. The opea was Verdi. The Sicilian Vespers. A rare rather political opera I thought it appropriate for a country so often occupied. The performers were old favorites with the audience and now new favorites with me. I can't wait to return. I did have to laugh when the meant to be helpful written words dropped down...in Hungarian of course"

The spectators are mostly tourists and other random people... but try to go to the highest gallery, where particular singers' fans often are for every performance of their favorites! The atmosphere on this gallery is a smell of what you can feel if you go to the other opera theatre of Budapest, Erkel Theatre, where all people are locals, and... but I'll write that in the respective review. Anyway ig you're in Budapest don't miss the Opera House. I'd reccomend especially the Hungarian national historical opera, B\u00e1nk B\u00e1n, which is usually played around 15th March, the Hungarian National Holiday."

The tour and \" mini-concert\" was the lowlight of our trip to Budapest - expensive, underwhelming and the mini- concert a total rip-off - TWO songs by a female singer in the bar area, accompanied by tinny music through a CD player. We thought we'd get at least two more from a male, then a duet. Two arias do not a concert make! The Opera House itself is fine, but the guide's relentless would-be dramatic tales of its eventful history irritated. The Callas cafe opposite is great for its gypsy trio while waiting, and the terrine ain't half bad."

The architecture both inside and outside is striking and beautiful; inside one feels that they are journeying back to the Hapsburg empire. The season lasts from September to June and boasts a rich repertoire. The seat prices are very reasonable by North American standards. In the three weeks that my granddaughter and I were in Budapest we went to six operas. We had seats ranging from $50 to $5 (the $5 seats were last minute and at the top of the building). The sound is good everywhere but he sight lines need some adjusting. If you have a seat in a box in the second (ie back) row, you will have difficulty in seeing everything. So choose your seats with care. Also the operas are performed in the original languages (usually Italian or German) with Hungarian over-titles (i.e. titles above the stage). There are no English over-titles, so one needs to know the plot beforehand (the programmes are in English which helps a lot). Even if you not an avid opera fan, you will be impressed by attending at least one performance."

We purchased a programme,being unfamiliar with the story, as the subtitles are in Hungarian,and it was fine. the bar was empty at the interval unlike other opera houses we have visited where you cannot get near the bar at all!

A man came out and belted out a few songs. It was my first time to hear an opera and he was really good. I guess it depends on your personality. I enjoyed listening to all kinds of music so listening to the mini concert was a no brainier. You can choose to take the mini concert or skip it. As for the tour, it was enjoyable.

That was really amazing experience, the music is awesome, the singers are very professional. The tickets - we took at the balcony - very cheap. It was worth it for sure.We wouldn't recommend at all to go to the Callas cafe on the left of the opera, if you stay in front of it. Now, that was plastic quality and snob attitude of the service. Overpriced. You could say what to expect from the place with such location, and I would say - nice manners of a waiter would be enough, since visiting that place was pure pass-time before the performance. If you want to enjoy the high cuisine, just go to the 5 stars hungarian restaurants like Onyx, but for the coffee and dessert near the opera - anywhere nearby except CALLAS cafe."

Seats were a little uncomfortable, but no worse than those at the Royal Albert Hall in London.The only downside was that sub-titles (above the stage) were in Hungarian only - but, even so, this didn't detract too much from our enjoyment of the performance.The interior architecture is absolutely beautiful, the acoustics are amazingly good, and the atmosphere is electric.Even if you are not interested in opera, it's worth booking a ticket for the experience alone."

So we booked online (self printed ticket) for the huge sum of 500HUF each (my credit card has been charged \u20ac3.40 in total!!) At that price we were expecting a large pillar in front of us, but at least it wouldn't affect hearing the opera.We had to enter through a side door, and climb seemingly endless flights of stone steps (rather austere in fact) before reaching a bar area and entry into the auditorium itself.Wow! - such a contrast to the stairway,so breathtaking with gold decorations everywhere.We were on the top circle and our seats were on the top row to the side. No pillar obscuring the view, but we could only see a third of the stage or just over half if we stood up. There were however large Video screens either side of the stage.

After all, what makes this edifice so magical is that is is a living thing. Unlike so many of the grand buildings we tour, this opera house is not a relic or a museum piece from a distant time in the past, it is used today as was designed to be used over a century ago. And you can experience the building's beauty and vitality today first hand as a participant in its active function.. But if you can't attend a performance, you will want to take the tour offered at 3 PM and 4PM every day. And if you do take the tour, you WILL want to take photographs. But here's the catch. You need to pay extra for the priviledge. This fee is nominal and not the issue. The iksome thing about it is that, for most of us, we were unaware of the requirement until after the tour started. By that time it was too late. At least a dozen of us on my tour were disappointed as we put away our cameras. The space is just too photogenic.There is no mention of this extra requirement on the tour's official website. And there was no notice of any prominence,if at all, stipulating the requirement at or around the cashier's desk. Only one member of our group knew about this beforehand. She wore a red wristband which signified that she was authorized to take photographs. For the rest of us, photography was verboten. So be sure inquire about a photo pass when you buy your tour ticket.In any event, do go and enjoy a truly manificent piece of architecture."

The quality was without doubt at the highest level of performance and the cost was so small compared with London prices. A stalls seat only cost us \u00a315 each and the standard was worth considerably more. Overall the soloists were vocally of an international standard and it would be hard to criticise when we paid so little. We will definitely return."

For any classical music fan, it is a relatively affordable must see.If you are less classically inclined consider a ballet, perhaps a bit more palatable than the opera. We saw A Midsummers Night Dream last weekend, and it was magical. Our tickets at 12000 huf (just over 50 USDollars),were the most expensive in the house (a splurge for my husbands birthday)... Much lesser priced options were also available.The side streets of Andrassy ut are overflowing with cafes, bars, and restaurants. Our traditional choice is Menza on Liszt Ferenc Ter."

I had never attended an opera and really did not understand much of it, but the experience of the sound and the building was amazing. I sat in an upper box during a daytime performance and was able to appreciate the architecture from that vantage point. I did not have formal clothes to wear, but I did not feel out of place. I wore a nice sweater and jeans, but saw others in T-shirts. Some attendees were much more formal -- it was a mix of all walks of life, tourists and locals. I highly recommend attending a performance here. It is a much more complete experience than just a building tour, which also is offered."

Although I only speak a total of about 20 words of Hungarian, I decided to go with my relatives to see B\u00e1nk B\u00e1n at the famous Budapest Opera House. This opera is considered the country\u2019s national opera. All of my relatives who grew up in Hungary studied this opera in school. The story is a Romantic melodrama by Ferenc Erkel, and takes place in 13th Century Hungary. It\u2019s virtually unknown outside of Hungary since the opera was written and composed for Hungarian singers. There certainly aren\u2019t many opera singers outside of Hungary who can sing opera in Hungarian! This opera is so treasured by the nation that the Hungarian State Opera in Budapest has opened every season with it since the theater's founding in 1884. First of all, the Budapest State Opera House is stunning\u2026absolutely stunning. Built by Mikl\u00f3s Ybl in the neo-Renaissance style, the building is replete with paintings, carvings, sculptures, gilding, crystal chandeliers, and sweeping marble stairways. We arrived early just to gawk and take photos. Our seats were fabulous\u2014five rows from the orchestra pit\u2014and cost 12,000 forints each, or about $51.00 US/Canadian. Where else in the world can you get such fantastic seats at a famous opera for such a bargain? You can order tickets on line. However, our actual seats were not very comfortable\u2026they were very hard and not at all cushy enough for a three-act opera. My four, very tall male cousins felt seat-weary by the end of the performance, and we saw many people fidgeting in their seats throughout the performance. Although there were German subtitles on the night we attended the performance, this didn\u2019t help those of us who spoke only English. When my cousin in Budapest booked our tickets the previous month, he was told that there would be a written summary of the acts available in English so we could follow the story line. However, when we arrived for the performance, there was nothing at all in English! It\u2019s a good thing there were three relatives in our group who spoke Hungarian so they could tell us the story plot. We also got a short verbal summary in English from a staff member during the intermission. If you plan to see this opera in Budapest, and no English subtitles or written summary are available, I would highly suggest that you find a summary of the story plot on the Internet so you will know what\u2019s happening. Print it out and take it with you to the performance so you can understand what\u2019s going on, act by act. I also found a movie of the opera on YouTube, and it was helpful to watch it before I left home. If you have somewhat of a clue about the story line, then not knowing the Hungarian language will not be a msjor disadvantage. The opera itself was a joy to see. The costumes, the quality of singing, and the stage sets were all top-notch. As was the music. There were some typically Hungarian instruments used by the orchestra\u2026listen for them! After one patriotic song where the hero sings about his homeland of Hungary, the audience clapped in unison for several minutes and stopped the show. It was an extremely moving moment. Having a glass of wine in the bar during intermission was a special event as well. The male server behind the bar spoke impeccable English, so ordering a drink was easy.If you can\u2019t arrange tickets for an opera performance, or are concerned about watching an opera in Hungarian with no English subtitles, daily tours of the opera house are available in English.All-in-all, this was an experience in Budapest that I\u2019ll always treasure."

I was a guest so i do not know the price but it was worth it at any price. The intermissions were enough time to view that building. My friend thought it wsa on the small side probably because of Hollywood and how anything looks bigger on screen, but i reminded him that in days of old not that many people could afford to attend the opera so a giant setting was nto needed. Just a plain great experience that will linger long in my memory.the booths bing back memories of historical intrigue and the king's booth is quite elaborate."

Granted there was a bit more information provided, but considering the tour cost more than some of the tickets for a show I would have much preferred to see a show.Overall, the building is worth seeing, given it's age and architectural detail, but I think it'd be better seen during a performance rather than the tour."

We really enjoyed the history and the splendor of this fantastic sight! Don't pay for the 'concert' as it is only two singers and a guitarist in a side salon room, but we did pay extra in order to be able to take pictures inside the theater and capture the building's splendor! Directly across from the Opera metro stop and located in a high-end shopping district."

We chose to buy tickets in one of the boxes towards the side of the stage. I have been in numerous opera houses and these seats were great! On the ticket, they were called: \"Stalls Level Boxes Left 2nd Number row 1, seat 2 and seat 3\". There were two other people in our box, and they didn't have as good of a view as us. I believe one of those seats would have been sold as an obstructed view. There was also a settee in the box, which may seat other people, I'm not sure. On our night it was empty. Having a box, even when sharing it with strangers felt very glamorous :)The translation was in English and appeared above the stage, it was easy to read and still watch the actors on stage. During intermission, be sure to step outside onto the terrace with your drink. So lovely. It's also very easy to get to, as there is a metro station directly outside the theater (aptly named \"Opera\"). Do check what time the metro runs until though. We went for a drink afterwards at a nearby pub and had to walk home as the metro was then closed. I highly recommend seeing an opera here, it's a wonderful experience!"

One tip: don't pay the price to tour the Opera House when you can enjoy an opera for as little as $3. Don't let the price fool you; it's world class and it's better to hear some of the opera and experiencing the confines with people in attendance versus being whisked through the turn-of-the-century gem with 100 others from a tour group.

Needn't have worried -although it was sung in Italian, with sub titles on the screen in Hungarian, we had no difficulty in following what was going on. The acting, singing and music were superb. I laughed and cried myself silly- I've never enjoyed an opera so much, and I've seen a few....And the setting -we sat at the front of a gold encrusted box-and it only cost \u00a332!!! We'd pay at least double that in London. Also loved people watching in the intervals at the bar. Dress up if you can. It was the highlight of our trip, and we came out walking on air..."

If you don't speak English that's alright because you have several language options for the tour from Spanish to French, German, Japanese... You take a pick!The tour is good in general but there's little time to take pictures if you're in the English tour (which, usually, is one of the most popular). The guide talks and at the end of each talk in each room she just moved on to the next room and starts talking again... almost running from one room to another. It's understandable because a group of 15 or 20 people is difficult to control, specially with the little time they have as it's all very synchronized with the other languages tours. All tours happen at the same time and it looks like a dance of groups from room to room. I will not rate it as a 5 because of this... the most popular tours should start slightly early or should happen in other times so people could have more time to enjoy the rooms and be able to take some pictures without having to do it while the guide is talking. If you're listening to the guide and taking pictures at the same time is more likely you'll loose information and it's not polite or fair to the guide's work isn't it?Although we should have more time exploring the building I can understand how things are programmed this way... opera staff needs to prepare the main concert hall for the night's show, etc.Singers and dancers also need to practice but some revaluation of times should be done here.The mini concert does not happen in the main concert hall but in another room. It consists in one opera singer who sings a few popular opera songs all dressed up. It was quite nice to have that taster after the tour. It was just so refreshing and worth the \u00a32 pounds more. So cheap!This taster ends with the singer choosing someone to dance. A very nice touch for the tourists indeed!One of the highlights of our trip and a must visit in Budapest. Don't miss it!"

The whole interior, stalls and horseshoe boxes are smaller than most grand opera theatres lending an intimacy to the performance similar to that in some of the regency theatres in in the UK. One is never quite as far away from the stage as in most operas. The boxes are superb if you sit in the chairs in the front row. The opera is well supported by the state, resulting in amazingly low prices - for the top class ticket you can pay as little as HUF 6000 (\u00a317 compare to Covent Garden's top price of \u00a3230). We heard Otello on a Sunday evening. It was a competent performance with a poorly directed first act in which the lead singers were disappointing; they seemed to warm up and improve significantly as the evening wore on. As long as you don't expect grand opera on the scale of Covent Garden, the Met, or La Scala you can enjoy a highly professional provincial opera in a beautiful building with an audience clearly supportive of their local opera. What may come as a disturbing surprise to anyone used to opera otherwise, is that the audience only applauds at the end of each act and remains silent throughout even when there is a bravado performance of a great aria. We found the silence somewhat distancing and felt that it was perhaps a strain on the singers who had to continue and not pause after a taxing effort, even where it is clear the music is composed to account for the expected applause. There were curtain calls after each act. The curtain was at 18.00 and the opera finished at 21.15 allowing ample time for dinner after the opera. They also have a ballet company but the ballet was sold out for the Saturday evening when we were there. The bar is comfortable and has a good selection of wines including Hungarian champagne. They also have open sandwiches and other snacks. Certainly a worthwhile, interesting and pleasurable way to spend an evening in Budapest."

But instead of splitting our large group into two smaller groups (as is done in Vienna), we travelled around as one large happy family. They do make you wear booties while walking around, which causes a bit of a bottle neck while checking in for the tour. Our tour guide was quite informative and enthusiastic and seemed to be well versed in the venue. We did actually pay for the photo pass, but it seemed that everyone was taking photos regardless. This is not well enforced and I guess we were scammed into buying it. The opera house itself is small, and there were quite a few comparisons to Vienna. I think the tickets were a bit expensive for what it is, especially if you have already seen the Staatoper in Vienna. As we were leaving, we were verbally assailed by some staff member. I am not sure what we did or why we were so bothersome to her. All we were doing at the time was opening the door to leave the opera house. She said some angry sounding words in Hungarian and shot us the meanest face she could conjure. All in all, I would not recommend the tour, as the building is underwhelming, it is expensive for what it is, and you might run into the mean lady who says angry things in Hungarian at you while you leave."

Externally, the State Opera House is a very grand and imposing building, from the front balcony of which Madonna performed in Evita. However, step inside to be greeted by a splendidly ornate vestibule and staircases boasting the finest materials that Hungary had to offer at the turn of the 19th century. Entering the auditorium reveals a further step-up in splendour - a beautifully 'La Scala Milan' style setting that must have used most of Hungary's supply of gilding (a little OTT for my plainer taste, but a must for lovers of substantial glitz and glamour). The admin staff from ticket office through to ushers couldn't have been more helpful.We were privileged to watch a performance of Donizetti's 'Don Pasquale', an opera with which we were unfamiliar upto that point. It doesn't have the pomp and grandeur of say Aida, Nabucco or Carmen but boy what a gem, containing some beautiful arias, duets and harmonous chorus section with a nice helping of humour. The cast were very impressive with nice performances particularly the acting of the lead and the voice of the soprano. As occasionally happens the male romantic lead was not the tallest person on stage and had a sweet voice of modest power; however, the very powerful soprano was able to show restraint during their especially beautiful love duet.Overall, amongst my operatic attendances (probably a dozen or so) this was probably the most enjoyable so far, providing a lovely performance in a great setting all for the ridiculous price of about \u00a311ph in stalls seats! This was the final dress rehearsal which meant that prices ordinarily starting as low as \u00a32 were reduced even further."

Wallet with all her money ( Euros, Forints, and Dollars ), Drivers license, our Passports, all credit cards and our debit card. I know the mistake that she made of carrying these items on her person but she did and it will not happen again. It was a nightmare reporting to the Credit Card companies, banks, American Embassy, even making a police report. The Opera House did not want to be involved so we had to walk to the police station to make a report, An interpreter was needed,so we waited over an hour after the two mile walk to the station. It cost us $270, which we had to borrow, to get temporary passports. It also cost us $129 for each local telephone call as Budapest does not have 1-800 or collect calls. If you are visiting, enjoy all the attractions and the people but be careful because you stand out. DO NOT CARRY PASSPORTS or too many credit cards. Keep cash in front pocket.Use the safe in the hotel."

The Opera on it s own is beautiful, so if notthing else thats worth for a look. After you see Balett with live music playing in front of the stage is just simply unbelivable.

We ran into some trouble of entirely our own making, but the management was incredibly helpful in sorting out the problem going well above and beyond what would be expected. The opera house itself is stunning and well worth the visit. I'd recommend buying tickets to see a performance rather then the tour as it is substantially cheaper and you get to enjoy a great evening out.

The tour was less informative than we had hoped because of the guide's English. The \"mini opera\" at the end is about 2 Euros and we thought it was going to be in the main opera room. However, it was in the bar area. The singer had an amazing voice, and he sung two songs. The mini opera was worth the money but don't expect anything elaborate.

This was worth it as we were able to walk through the entire building and see some areas that are not always open to the everyday visitor. Also we got to sit in one of the box seats while the history of the building was explained to us. We didn't pay for the mini-show and from the looks of it, we were pretty happy to have skipped that. We did pay the extra 500HUF to be able to take pictures but it seems that that wasn't a big concern for the guides as everyone was taking pictures. I'm not sure if that is how it is all the time but it made me question paying for it (even if it's only like $2.50). This building is a must stop at while visiting Budapest. The statues and everything that have gone into building it is just amazing."

The quality of singers and the beautiful interior of this opera house made it a very special occassion. Prices were very reasonable, as we paid $50/seat to sit 7 rows from the front. You might want to save a bit of money and sit in a booth along the side which I believe is slightly cheaper. The opera house was pretty much sold out so I'd recommend buying your tickets online. No additional fee if you purchase your tickets online and simply print them (which is different then the Prague State Opera, where tickets are sent to your hotel). I believe you can send $10 or less and still be able to appreciate the beauty of this grand building. Have a nice evening out at the opera."

I purchased the most expensive seats and it still was only around \u00a340 each. Once inside I realised I'd almost pay \u00a340 just to see the building! I would definitely recommend seeing an Opera here though rather than just going on a tour of the building it was fantastic! Despite the age of the building the stage area was fully modernised and equipped with moving platforms etc. The costumes, the music, the acting and even a bit of ballet was all fantastic! So go on immerse yourself in Hungarian culture and book tickets!! (I purchased mine online before going to Budapest.)"

We decided to take the 3 P.M. tour of this large and magnificent Opera House on a rainy afternoon, and it was an unmitigated disaster.The Opera advertized that they gave such tours in four or five languages, and what we experienced were an enormous number of people\u2014each linguistic group\u2019s tour was very oversubscribed, way too large a crowd to be manageable and to work, perhaps 50 or 60 or more people in each of four or five groups, all crowded together for their simultaneous tours, and colliding with each other as each large group moved from site to site on crowded stairways, in corridors, and rooms, and all the while each tour guide was trying to make him or herself heard over the competing tour guides, and the sheer noise created by so many people moving at the same time through the same small portions of the Opera house\u2019s echoing marble interior.Bottom line, discussing this disaster with many of the members of our Eastern European tour, who were also in our 3 P.M. English language Opera House tour group this afternoon, no one could really hear very much of anything the tour guide said; I do not blame the tour guides--for I expect that they would not have been able to be clearly heard, even if they had used bullhorns in these conditions, the blame falls, instead, on whoever organized things in this manner.The final straw was when our tour guide took our group up to the balcony seats\u2014we never actually got to get to the ground floor to observe the stage\u2014where a lucky few of us got to briefly sit and try to peer around to try to take in the interior of the hall and to see the stage below\u2014those standing behind them in the box were out of luck--and all while the guides for the other tour groups had also brought their own groups to sit in different sections of the balcony seats, all the guides\u2014in that large space with its great acoustics\u2014giving their spiels at once\u2014it was sheer bedlam, the Tower of Babel, and very disappointing. And there this very short tour--I suspect truncated due to these conditions--ended.The Opera House should be ashamed of the way they organized this supposed \u201ctour.\u201d They need to put a reasonable limit on tour group sizes and to stagger the times of the tours, so that each group will not interfere with the others, and so that each individual tour guide has a reasonable chance to be heard by those they are giving their tours to, without being interfered with by other tours going on nearby."

We had stamped this as the highlight of our visit to Budapest and it was ruined within 10 minutes of the start by the chaos that ensued. Our group (english speaking) was split into three because it was so large - all language groups were sent into the main theatre at the same time because rehersals were due to start (if this was the case the tour should not have taken place - short changing the paying customer is not a solution !) We did not hear a word that was being said as the ambient noise level was so high. We were shunted out of this area pretty quickly into other little areas which we shared with other groups. It is fair to say we hardly heard a word said by our guide. We cut our losses, registered our disapproval with the management whose explanations were both dismissive and an insult to our intelligence. Regulating the size of groups that can be properly managed at times when rehersals are not scheduled to take place is relatively easy to organise and it is a sad reflection on the management of this magnificent building that this was not done."

It was very crowded and a little chaotic at first, so my advice is to buy your tickets early, but it worked out just fine. The staff was even accommodating enough to split our very large English speaking tour group into two groups. The focus of the tour is more on the magnificent rooms and you don't get to see the back of the stage like with the Vienna Opera House tour. But the grandeur of this building is something that can't be missed.

Also, it can be difficult to plan at being there at exactly those times.Tip: if you would like to take pictures...you need to buy a photo ticket. There were people taking pictures without the \"bracelet\"...so I don't know if it is necessary if you are good at not getting caught. I do feel that it is a bit ridiculous to have to pay for a photo ticket after you paid for the tour."

Lasts about 30-45 mins.If I recall correctly it costs 2800 HUF (approx \u00e2\u0082\u00ac9/10)...then they ask if you want to see the mini show (a super cheesy guy sings 2/3 songs), it's an additional 500HUF and then if you want to take photos while inside it's an additional 500HUF on top of that (the photograph taking wasn't policed on my visit). You receive wrist bands for the extras as proof of purchase.Our tour guide was just about average. She relayed many facts in an extremely boring manner and seemed quite jaded by tourists. It's a very beautiful building. Worth seeing, but I'm not sure worth 3800HUF if you go with all the added extras (approx the same price as a day in the baths)."

Groups were split into the language of the tourists (English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish) which I thought nice, but about a third of the group was English and ended up overwhelming the one English guide whose poor little microphone and speaker could not be heard by all but those standing immediately next to her. I personally couldn't hear a word. Mobs of pushy people in groups criss-crossing and bumping into each other, cramming into small rooms, occasionally shoving, all putting a major damper on the beauty of the place. Eventually we \"lost\" our group (along with about 20 others) and we tagged along with the much smaller Spanish group - even though my Spanish is bad enough and I could only understand about 20% of what the guide was saying, it was still better than the 0% I could hear from the English guide. After that group my wife and I sort of meandered around on our own which wasn't exactly permitted, but finally found some beauty to salvage out of the fiasco.I'm sure that attending a performance here is an unsurpassed experience, but do yourself a favor and skip the tour."

There were over 100 in the English speaking group and our guide spoke so fast and you couldn't hear a thing if you were in the back of the crowd. The microphone with the speaker was a joke, my grand kids have one just like it and it was a joke. Paying for taking pictures was also wrong as no one hardly had the band on and they were taking pictures and never paid. Also the 5 minute \"mini concert\" was NOT IN THE THEATRE! Nope it was in a room and it too was very disappointing, all in all a rip off. The building is lovely but they need to learn how to organize this tour better as at times there were several groups in different languages and all of them were talking at the same time and trying to talk louder than one another. Save your money and time!"

I knew from looking at the internet prior to leaving home, that there were only a handful of tickets left for the following Saturday's performance of Tosca. Once I had checked into the hotel, I made my way to the Opera House and was fortunate to discover that some tickets remained available. I was not really bothered where I sat as whilst I enjoy all kinds of music, was not sure if this was really for me. I therefore went for the cheapest which was for HUF4000 which appears to be extraordinary good value and probably recognises the subsidy from the government. I had a choice of rear stalls, box, or front balcony. I opted for the latter.I made my way up the endless flights of stairs and since I had no idea where to sit, showed my ticket to a guide and she told me to sit at the front. I happilly sat where she said and had plenty of leg room and a fantastic view. The seat to the right of me remained empty but the two seats to the left of me were occupied at various times by no less than six people during the performance as they sought to gain advantage from their inferior places further back. This resulted in arguing and the guide being called to sort matters out.The performance consisted of three scenes of about 45 minutes each with twenty minute breaks. I did not understand a word since the subtitles shown in lights above the screen were in a foreign language but I got the gist of what was going on and this did not detract from the experience. I thought that it was overall, simply a wonderful performance from superb performers in an outstanding opera house.One last point, once back at the hotel, I realised that my seat should have been in the second row and whether I was directed to the front in error or not, I will never know. I was delighted where I was sat since on later checking the seats behind me, I discovered that apart from the view, the others had no leg room whatever."

At one I took a box seat at 12000HUF, the others a 3rd floor (central section) seat at 1200/1300HUF (c\u00a33.50!). There was very little difference to justify the 10x markup, but all were terrific value compared with UK prices. There are a few restricted view seats available from 500HUF.My advice - don't book the afternoon tours (c\u00a32600HUF) - just attend a performance and ask for 3rd floor, central section, seats. You have to enter via a side door - but you can see the main staircase anytime. The building is just fabulous, outside and in, and the acoustics very good."

The inside is a riot of painting and gilded woodwork that will dazzle your senses. The rich reds and golds give a luxurious quality to the music house.

We were on a walking tour and were being shown the inside of the Opera House and took a chance on seeing if any tickets might be available to see the Opera Carmen. Good luck for us they still had a couple of seats left. This was our first experience with opera and we loved it! The seats were not the greatest but we enjoyed the performance tremendously. We also loved the opulent theater. If you get a chance this is a good place to see an opera."

We thought we would do one of the tours they give most days at 3 or 4 pm. But we were on the fence about taking the tour when we found it cost about $15/person (including the optional \"mini concert\"). We asked someone leaving the earlier tour and they said it was wonderful so we paid our money and took the tour. And we were glad we did.The large (huge) group of people was efficiently broken up into smaller groups by language and size of group. Our group of about 20 had a wonderful/enthusiastic younger woman guide who was quite knowledgeable about the history of the opera and explained it's history and highlights in an entertaining way as she took us through the many different areas of the opera house.The real highlight was at the end when we did the \"mini concert\". One of the lead female soloists came into a smaller lounge area (with tremendous acoustics) and performed two songs for the group of about 50 who had chosen this option. Hearing her perform \"close up\" was one of the best vocal performances I have ever heard and certainly attended. In the second number she was using an empty crystal glass as a prop for the scene the song she was singing was associated with. I kept waiting to see if the glass would shatter (like in the old \"is it live or is it Memorex\" commercials). Overall highly recommended."

Please note that the cheapest tickets category, as we bought, will offer you a view for only half of the stage (if you will be able to book a seat on the first row of the balcony- probably the view will be better). It is OK if you are not the biggest opera fan and come to feel the ambiance... So if you would like to see the opera itself, even from afar, pay more and enjoy the full experience (you can buy a ticket in the center of the balcony for about 6$ per ticket, if you book in advance).Don't buy the tiny binoculars the opera offers. It is useless and a waste of money (500 HUF+ Deposit of some sort of identity card/driving license/mobile phone). Pay more for the tickets and you will see the stage, even if you are far from the stage, I promise you.The building itself is amazing and the ambiance is unique. it is a MUST DO experience.I would recommend it to anyone coming to Budapest.The dress code is a bit more relaxed than we thought- people were dressed elegantly but you will blend in the crowd even without a sparkling evening gown or a tuxedo.

We were ushered to our booth on the second tier. Six chairs and the sight of everything-- stage, orchestra pit, main floor and other booths. Lavish decor and architectural highlights. Stunning.. The production began and the acoustics were jaw-dropping. The balance between pit and stage, chorus and soloists, the costuming, the dynamics, totally engrossing. I am certain that no matter the production, this is an incredible company to see in an incomparable setting. Our tickets were about $35 USD each and the seats were prime. A great date night."

Our tour itself was somewhat over subscribed, but not a problem as they split the English tour into two groups. Our guide, Cecelia, was excellent - knowledgable, friendly, funny and obviously passionate about opera and the building itself. We went to the mini-concert afterwards, which consisted of a couple of songs - great fun and worthwhile doing if you're not going to see an opera, so you can at least have heard some opera in the opera house!"

I've been to the Opera once before-it was a terrible one so I let myself be persuaded to go to this one following the reviews (and mainly my other halfs insistence). It was really a great experience and the singing was superb. The building itself is a place to see as its really quite something else. Very posh affair where everyone gets dressed up so make sure you bring your sunday best. And it was very cheap compared to Operas in other parts of the world, so i'm told."

I have NEVER been interested in opera and could not have imagined enjoying a performance of Tosca sang in Italian with Hungarian subtitles BUT I DID!2. I chose Tosca for its 3 Acts (with 2 opportunties for a discreet escape...!) and 2 hours and 50 minutes performance (a reasonable time to sit still and be QUIET)Booking the tickets via the Opera House on-line system was remarkably easy. I was able to print e-tickets immediately and a few days before the performance I received an email reminder. Two tickets for seats in a 'box' on the Upper Cicle cost \u00a344.55 (in total). We shared it with two other people with ample space to hang our coats up. At times our view of the action on stage was restricted and next time I would chose more central seats rather than at the side. The ambience in the Opera house was relaxed (rather than formal or stuffy) and the staff were helpfull and spoke English.The performance was powerful and engaging AND despite the language issues I cried at the end.........The beautiful interior added to the experience and I would highly recommend attending a performance at the Hungarian State Opera House. Be brave and go!"

A tour of the Hungarian State Opera House (Magyar \u00c1llami Operah\u00e1z) was rather superficial but well worth the opportunity to see its interior grandeur and Neo-Renaissance touches. The fa\u00e7ade\u2019s balustrade displayed large statues of composers including Smetana, Mozart, Wagner, Tchaikovsky and a host of others. Corinthian columns on the second floor framed elegant archways. Inside, marble and gold leaf were de rigeur along with ceiling friezes/frescos which depicted a plethora of mythology including the Apotheosis of Music. It seemed almost as ornate as the Garnier in Paris. Marble columns were constructed of three different types of marble which differentiated its components: the post, pedestal and capital. Gleaming gilt capitals effortlessly supported the ceiling. The interior was dripping in gilt which was a foil to the relative poverty of the nation during its construction. The auditorium was relatively small (I\u2019m from New York City)in spite of the young docent\u2019s description as large \u2013 her first tour in English. There was no carpeting to help facilitate sound. Oddly, the parterre boxes had walls with their only opening facing the audience \u2013 quite antithetical to effective acoustics, and underscored the \u201csee and be seen\u201d culture that was indifferent to the performance at hand. I would strongly advise against paying an additional fee for a \u201cmini-concert\u201d that followed the formal tour which was an embarrassing solo performed by a less than inspiring tenor."

We also reserved wine/food for intermission so we did not have to wait in any queues. Therefore had plenty of time to look around. It is truly a gorgeous building in fine details. If you need bathrooms then try to find them early. We tried to find them at the end of the performance and as we could not see any signs, went to the lowest level to be told that bathrooms are only upstairs. We have mixed feelings about the Mefistofeles and would not recommend it but that is another story."

At the start of this year, the same thing almost happened again. Only this time curiosity wasn\u2019t the motive, but the public anger of tens of thousands of people protesting against the in the Opera House celebrating supporters of the current government. Fortunately the building was spared another assault.The citizens of 1884 must have stopped, mouth wide open, when entering the Opera. For the wealth of the former Budapest appears to be carved in the walls of the place. The building resembles an inflated jewel box in which the giant collection of gold ornaments of the wife of Francis Joseph is stored. It is gold, gold & gold that glitters, and when the lights go out, you have caught a mild gold fever when you slide away into the red plush.We visited the opera Rigoletta by Verdi, part if which is well known by many people from an advertisement for pizza (....). But at the sound of La Donna e Mobile the thoughts of pizza quickly shift to the catering of the Opera itself which contributes to the delicious experience of your visit to the Opera. Wonderful hors d'oeuvres with salmon and caviar for the price of a pretzel. You eat them together with the tasty dressed Budapestian crowd surrounded by sumptuous ornaments. It is like being a living work of art framed in gold.In terms of seating choice, we recommend the lodge/stalls. For 40 euros you're like a Royal sitting in front two seats in the box opposite the stage. Between enjoying the music, the play and watching the audience and the building, it is hard to restrain yourself from rasing your arm, opening a slightly curved palm of your hand and wave like a Royal to the people below."

The most important one is as it's cheaper! We got very good seats for \u00a34.50! The tour was double the amount and was only to last 45mins. The opera was our evening entertainment, was much cheaper than sitting in a restaurant or a bar and lasted 3 hours! However, please be aware that you must pay for cloakroom as no jackets or bags are allowed inside. The woman on the cloakroom could not speak a word of English and was very rude to us (even though we attempted to speak Hungarian)."

The singers are incredible, world class and it is simply a joy to be present in the most fabulous building \"old Europe\" has ever seen! We have been to a few performances here and only one that was done in a rather contemporary design was a bit strange - the singing still was fabulous.

The story is that emperor Franz Josef only visited one performance because the Hungarian builders had succeeded in making the house more beautiful than the Vienna State opera... so he never came back.Perhaps true - in any case this house is well worth seeing. Much smaller than both Vienna and Paris opera houses it has exquisite details and paintings - and good acoustics. And it's in great condition! It's cheap to see a performance (subsidized by the government), so if your'e into opera, do go. Or, if you just want to see the house, there are excellent guided tours most every day in several languages. Check online."

We actually chose our dates for our next trip to Budapest according to the HSOH program.It is outstanding quality, both for program and interpretations. Do not expect anything too avant-garde, though. It is rather conservative (or perhaps we could call it consensual). I strongly advise booking through the official Opera House website. It is extremely easy to navigate (after a few hesitations) and has an English translation (click on the \"ticket\" button and from there on, you are redirected to the venue plan). Seats are available a month ahead only and some dates are going very fast, leaving you with a very small choice of limited view side seats: the locals are keen music amators and the prices are incredibly low, even to local standards. Expect to pay around 50US$ at most for a central dress circle seat.At interlude, you can enjoy a glass on the large balcony overlooking Andrasy Avenue. There again, sandwiches and Tokay are of excellent quality. We attended three consecutive nights and regretted not having booked more.There are quite a few nearby restaurants for after concert dinner, which leaves you about half an hour to order before kitchens close. We so loved brasserie La Callas, just across the street, that we went there all three nights. It offers an \"italo-hungarian\" cooking and a very good selection of wines. It is an animate favorite amongst the locals. As stated before, we are planning our next hungarian trip based on the opera program and noticed that some periods would allow us to attend sixt nights without seeing the same concert twice.The only (slight) down side would be that the locals are such an enthusiastic public that they tend to applaud between scenes - and even after arias, which brutally pulls you back down to Earth and reality in the middle of the music."

The only tickets remaining were either around \u00a3300 or \u00a33 for both of us. We went for the \u00a33 option and weren't disappointed. The 'standing' seats still gave us a view of the stage and the performance was wonderful. The opera house is a beautiful building surrounded by high end shops if you fancy some pre-opera window shopping. Very easy to get to on the tube. Highly recommended."

The production was Don Giovani and it was a season premier.Tickets for the opera in Budapest are remarkably good value and row 5 stalls costs around \u00a0\u00a345. A word of advice about buying tickets. They sell out very fast and you need to book as soon as the sales open so check the web site in advance of any visit.Stall seats are good and the front row of any boxes. Be careful though of row 2 in boxes as the view is obscured. Be aware that operas are sung in original language and the subtitles will be in Hungarian. As a result you need to know the story in advance but the programme is in English which helps.The quality is superb and fr the price paid it was a bargain. I did however find it disconcerting hat the audience show their appreciation through a slow hand clap.....The seats offer a great view but are fiendishly uncomfortable and over 3.5 hours of Don Giovani it was hard on the posteria.The building is fabulous and is a gold leafed homage to former times. It is worth a visit on its own. Even if you are not an opera fan get cheap tickets for the top tier, enjoy what you can and leave....they are cheaper than a tour!!!!The bar was reasonable value but very busy and crowded. Sipping champagne in such surroundings however was wonderful.Dress is smart on the whole with lots of fur but few dinner suits. A lounge suit will suffice and dressing up is all part of the fun........have a great time.......and do go!!!!"

One annoying fact was that it was mandatory to hand in your coats and that too at a price! Didn't understand why you absolutely had to do that.

Tickets are reasonable (the nosebleed seats are roughly $2.50), the venue is fabulous and intimate, and the performers quite good. Other reviewers have commented that it is necessary to 'dress up' - not so in late 2011. Any sort of 'basic black' will do; only one or two long dresses in evidence and only a few suits for men. We saw Rigoletto, which is of course in Italian, and the translation is in Hungarian! There are no programs with summaries so read the libretto before going. The only drawback is that the seats are very uncomfortable! Bring something soft to sit on."

It was very over-priced and didn't even last as long as advertised.You can wander around the Paris Opera for nothing and see almost as much. The 'mini-concert' which cost extra was very disappointing.

The view from these seats was awful (you would have had to stand up to see the stage though they did have one seat on steps which you could sit on) but luckily for us the seats in front weren't booked and so we got to sit at the front of the box. We aren't opera fans and didn't understand it and left after the first break, but we booked to go so we could see the inside of the opera house for a fraction of the tour price.

The main opera theatre was quite impressive and some of the smaller rooms were also interesting \u2013 some ornate, some with impressive wood carving. Reading between the lines (or the story told by our guide), like a lot of Budapest's public buildings it was built cheap to look flash - but it is certainly in far better condition than most!It was hot outside and the building was very stuffy and a lot of people in our group were ready to quit early. Some needed to sit down and we were very glad of the complementary drink at the end. However, we were glad to have persevered for the mini opera performance by 2 very good singers (a tenor and a soprano) in the foyer stairwell for a couple of numbers.Extremely interesting, but we would have enjoyed it a lot more on a cooler day."

If you sit in the top section you do have to enter by a side door and have a lot of steps to climb. You cannot enjoy the lovely main entrance.

The mini-concert was okay, not unmissable - just a single singer in a side-room singing along to a cd for a few minutes. You can also buy a pass to take photos, but I doubt they'd stop you from taking pictures without the small bracelet.Overall, I would recommend the tour, it was an enjoyable afternoon activity."

You can imagine the carriages bringing the 19th C aristocrats up the cobble stone ramp to the portico main entrance. As other reviewers have mentioned, the first row of the boxes are recommended, but compared to other famous opera houses around the world, anywhere you sit the tickets are inexpensive. We were lucky enough to get excellent seats for a performance of Parsifal on Good Friday. Try getting to the outside terrace during intermission.

My husband and I went to both Budapest and Vienna, so we were able to tour the opera houses in both cities within a couple of days of one another to compare them. I liked both very much, as the buildings are extremely beautiful inside and out. The only issue with the tour is that they offer like 6 tours at once to accommodate multiple languages. The English tour is most crowded, maybe 40 people on our tour. So it was hard to hear him in our own group, but even more so with several different foreign languages talking over one another in basically the same space. The guide did the best he could, but I wish they could maybe offer an additional English tour to thin out the groups a little so that everyone could hear the history. Nevertheless, please take the tour (or see a show) - the building is well-worth seeing even if you cannot hear all of the details of its history."

For the relatively high price of 2850 HUF (about $15) each you get to stand in a very hot line to buy tickets, get to stand in another line to enter into the foyer, and get to stand as a (language) group waiting for the tour guide(s) to show up about 10-15 minutes after the scheduled start time of the tour. The tour comprises sitting for about 5 minutes in the auditorium, being shepherded into and out of \"Sissy's box\", parlour and stairwell and the ante-room to the emporer's box. That's it. Most of the time is spent being herded around (all the tours in all the languages start at the same time) and crowd controlled as the various tour groups compete for space and their 30 seconds of peeking. Its also very hard to hear the tour guide (no microphone). Total time on the tour is 20 minutes - and then one is summarily ushered out into the street. Compared to other tours of other Opera Houses (Paris, Vienna...) this is by far the worst. Not worth the HUFs. Try and catch a performance instead."

Apparently everybody wanted to see the opera at Christmas time, so we were very lucky to get seats at all. The operahouse is beautiful, sort of smaller version of the great Paris Opera house, Opera Garnier with a grand stair case, and gallery too. All the marble and gilding, and poshy boxes. The Hungarian State operas performance of La Boheme in Dec 22 2009 was a very good one, great singing albeit occasionally singers really had to fight the orchestra from taking over. The sets were just wonderful, the view over Paris roofs made you believe you were actually there, the Latin Quarter scene was a vibrant one, and the winter scene at the toll gate, with all the trees and snow was so romantic and realistic at the same time, it was very beautiful. The set painters excelled in their job! Accoustics are good. The seats however, at the orchestea level were not very comfortable, they had very little stuffing on the wooden seats. But since the opera had two intermissions, this wasn't a problem. They had so manu bars in the grand gallery that there was virtually no waiting to get a drink or a sandwich, coffee etc. The prices, as in most operas, were on the high side. There is a place to leave your coat, and outerwear for a small charge. The ladies responsible are very nice and very efficient.Getting to the Opera is easy as it has it's own Metro station. Please note that the doors to the Opera do not open until 45 minutes ahead of the start, and you're not allowed in (to get your coat checked, and to your seat) until 30 minutes prior to performance begins."

Just as a warning for those that are 5'9\" and taller these rows are quite close and difficult to get your legs to fit comfortably. For all grand circle tickets you enter from the side of the building and do not go up the grand staircase of the opera house. For Aida we sat in the 400 HUF (\u00a31.28) tickets of box 5 level two. The second row of seats in the boxes had absolutely no view. If I stood I was able to see 1/3 of the stage. The single pink 3800 HUF ticket in the box is actually a chair on a raised platform that has roughly a 2/3 stage view. However these box tickets allow for entry through the main entrance and you get to go up the grand staircase.I enjoyed both performances.

There's nothing really wrong with the tour; I just didn't find it worthwhile in and of itself.So, if I had the opera house to do over, I'd either:1. Walk into the lobby and absorb the interior from there and then walk around the exterior (the front and one of the sides) in order to appreciate the building's exterior. This superficial \"tour\" is free and it's not TOO much less involved than taking in the standard tour by itself.OR2. Take the standard tour and then see a performance sometime during your stay. This way, the small bits of dough that you get on the tour will have a chance to rise into a satisfying piece of bread.Again, there's really nothing wrong with the standard tour...I just didn't find it worthwhile by itself. So, I suggest staying either completely superficial (and self-guided & free) or supplement the standard tour with a performance. The latter option costs more time and money, but IMO that investment is necessary because the standard tour by itself gives you five or six tidbits of information that immediately deflate once you leave the building."

If you have cheaper tickets you have to enter via the side entrace but I dont know at what the lowest price you can enter via the front is. If you are on a tight budget you really cant go wrong for a few quid! The opera house is easy to get to and the metro stops outside if you dont want to walk. There didnt seem to be a dress code as there were a few people in jeans and trainers, but I think it is nice to go looking a little bit smarter. Cameras are allowed inside just not during the performance!Read the story of your opera before you go otherwise you will not know what is happening!

The cheap \u00a31 tickets are very high up and do compromise your view a little, but it's still a price you can't complain at. You have to use a side entrance to the building when using these cheaper tickets, so you don't get to see much of the grand interior until you're up the stairs to the bar and cloakroom. The more expensive tickets are still very affordable and let you use the main entrance to the building which is good if you want to have a nose at the grandeur! The price at the box office is exactly the same as the online price which is very reasonable.You have to use the cloakroom as they don't allow any coats or large bags into the actual theatre, but that costs around \u00a31 also.The ballet itself was fantastic. Quite humourous and colourful, there was a large orchestra accompanying and I am told that the dancing was technically very good!Overall, it's a definite must-do when in Budapest. Even if you are only interested in looking inside the building itself. The price is so reasonable it shouldn't be missed!"

Just as everyone says, a stunning opera house, and the sense of history and tradition is everywhere - from the bust of Miklos Banffy on the grand stairway to the continuation of Mahler's tradition of playing the Leonore No3 overture before the final scene of Fidelio. This is where Matthew Barney filmed Cremaster 5! Fidelio was gloriously sung, and even more gloriously played (under the house conductor Janos Kovacs, not Fischer; this was a Sunday morning matinee) in a fascinating, though-provoking contemporary production (rather condescendingly, we'd expected old-school Eastern-bloc cardboard realism). And thrilling to get a box seat for \u00a315. Booked online from the UK; excellent online box-office system and the e-tickets worked perfectly. Loved the range of chilled Tokays and lavish patisserie available in the interval. Surrounded by Budapest folk in furs and jewels, sipping wine and smoking, it felt like being back before 1914. A terrific experience. But...(and I know many opera lovers will disagree with this)...as opera fans in our 30s, we expect surtitles today, and in a major house in a major European capital we think it's reasonable to expect them in English as well as Hungarian, the more so as the programme book was available in English, Hungarian and German - leading us to expect this. But they were in Hungarian only. I mean no disrespect to the Hungarian language, but clearly an international audience is expected in Budapest, so it's strange that it wasn't catered for - especially in an opera as dependent as Fidelio on spoken dialogue. At the Geneva Grand Theatre, surtitles are trilingual, so it's perfectly do-able!  This was a serious disapointment; the lighting was too low to read the libretto we'd brought along and while I knew the opera well enough not to need a translation, my partner - hearing Fidelio for the first time - was left frustrated and confused. Hearing this, of all operas, for the first time, in one of the greatest opera houses in the world, shouldn't be a frustrating experience."

It is smaller than some other European houses, but gorgeously baroque with a good deal of ornate detail. Ticket prices are very reasonable--so much so that I think, unless you are more a fan of architecture than opera, you should skip spending money on a tour and instead spend your money on a ticket to a performance. I saw Cosi Fan Tutte in Feb 2007 for under $10 and still had very good seats. At intermission the weather was just warm enough for us to enjoy a drink out on top of what I now know is called the \"risalit\" (under which carriages once dropped people off for a night out at the opera). From there you get a nice view of Andrassy Ut.For first time opera-goers, be aware that there are no English sub or supra titles available. There are only Hungarian supra-titles. So if you are uncomfortable not knowing what is being sung, I wouldn't suggest this as your first opera experience."

It was almost sold out and the performance was magnificent. Balcony seats but still very good. You can tour the Opera House during the day so you can learn about the building's gorgeous architecture...very worthwhile."

            "review": "Parsifal in Good Friday, how appropriate.. We went to Parsifal on Good Friday. It was well done, well sung and well played. No complaints at all. The audience was extremely happy with the performance and applauded and bravoed for longer than usual. We had great seats on the first floor with full view of the stage and the musicians. It is a beautiful building with an oldy-worldy feeling, paintings and big chandelier. We booked our seats on the internet and received them a week later by the post.Be warned though about the selection of operas in Easter. The themes are very appropriate for a 'catholic' Easter if you are happy with that.It means no comedy and no laughs but 'serious' works. Parsifal's religious, mysthical theme and length (3 acts, a bit more than 5 hours, starting at 5.00pm) can put off opera first-timers. There is also the question of language. Wagner's operas are of course in German. The simultaneous translation screen on top of the stage translates into...Magyar, of course! And the programme is very helpful..in Magyar, German and French. Have a look at the opera's summary in Wikipedia and then book your ticket, you will love it!"

            "review": "Disappointing production of Janufa. I agree with a previous reviewer that the Erkel seems to produce better productions than the Opera House. I saw Janacek's Janufa in March 2006 and it was a production disaster. The settings varied from ridiculous to non-existent. Lighting was poor. The acting unimpressive. Chubby tenors who are supposed to be handsome leading men don't seem very real to me and I do like some realism in the production. In contrast, at the Erkel I saw a sumptuous production of Puccini's Turandot. Costuming lighting, setting, acting . . . all were infinitely superior to the weak Opera House production of Janufa. I'll be seeing Janufa again at Glimmerglass Opera (NY) in a couple of months. I'm anticipating a handsome presentation typical of Glimmerglass with an emphasis on acting and action. But remember, you're making a big mistake if you don't experience a performance at the magnificent Budapest Opera House. I feel that it is much superior architecturally and in terms of decor to the Vienna Opera House."

            "review": "Not as good as the Erkel!. We went to 4 operas in Budapest over 4 nights - two at the State Opera House (Mozart's Don Giovani & Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth) and two at the Erkel Theatre (Verdi's Rigoletto and Bellini's Norma). Despite the fact that the State Opera gets all the publicity, the operas staged at the Erkel were infinitely better - in terms of both singing and production. This was evident, too, in the audience response: desultry clapping at the State Opera, repeat curtain calls at the Erkel where the singing was as good as at Covent Garden or the Met. Although the surroundings at the Erkel are no where near as grand as at the State Opera, the seats are a lot more comfortable and there is more leg room! And we couldn't find a bar at stalls level during the interval in the State Opera (although there was one 4 flights up). And the Ekel wasn't overheated!"
