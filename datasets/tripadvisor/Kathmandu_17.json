There are many priests there who for a fee will help families to prayer for loved ones with offerings that are placed in the river. They are happy for you to watch at a distance..Always go with an official guide who will explain what is going on, the cremations take place on the temple bank opposite, and may not be for some."

This came highly recommended and I was looking forward to a respectful place where the dead are sent on to their next life, what we experienced was dirty, drugged out and pushy young men trying to be our tour guide. We were here near the end of Dashain and because of this, perhaps, there was not much activity at the crematoria. The vibe here is creepy, not because bodies are being burned, but because of the people who hang out here. We left quickly. I would highly recommend coming here with a reputable guide. I would return, but only with a real guide. Enter at your own risk."

Its fascinating to learn how the cremations take place and where and on what for all the various castes..and see the 400AD temples and Shivalingas and more.. The Sadhus are colorful to see, but be wary they will want money for photos and they prefer international notes! You can spend a good half day at this fascinating site but its memories stay a long time.. emjoy!"

And, second; I will always treasure the memory of the evening ceremony that takes place on the banks of the river. It's a time when people gather for music and dance, and thank the Spirits for coming to greet the newly departed loved ones. It's organic, it's real, but, not morbid.

You can, of course, observe the bodies being brought to the cremation ghats, the oldest son pouring some incents and holly water from the river before lighting the funeral pyre, then ashes being discarded into the holly Baghmati and further down the river kids playing into the water and women doing their laundry. Here, death is not the end but just another step towards Nirvana.... The temple itself (available only to Hindus) is a masterpiece of Hindu architecture and, if you are interested in religions, in other ways of thinking of life and death, then you may not like to miss a visit Pashupatinath.. ."

One side is used for the purification of the bodies and across the bridge is the burning or cleansing of the bodies. Men are placed west to east and women are east to west. If you have a weak stomach be prepared to see actual bodies being burnt. When i went there was 2 already burning and 3 booked so I was able to see the whole process. They are monkeys here so keep your bag with you and if you want to take a picture with the holy men they expect a tip of about 250 ruprees each which I though was ridiculous but a tip or donation is not required but they will get upset if you don't tip them. One the far side you can see houses in the mountain where the priests live both Hindu and buddest are burnt here. The white temple you aren't allowed to enter this is where the holy water that purifies the body comes from and is prohibited for foreigners to enter but can see from the rop of the hill in full view. Definitely worth a trip to see and the entry cost is 1000 ruprees for two temples the other temple is about a 25 min walk from the starting point. The building survived the earthquake quite good with only afew small temples beyond repair."

It is a ceremony to move the Hindu deceased on to their next life. Yes there are people grieving and crying but ten minutes after the cremation starts everyone leaves and has had their closure. There are the tourists with the large lenses snapping away... yes annoying but it is 50 yards from the pyres and a given constant backdrop to the cremation ceremony. I snapped a few pictures and that was enough. There are millions of better pictures available... no need for more. Take a few minutes to sit and just be silent during the ceremony. Some people feel a great connection. I just think it is a very peaceful way to say goodbye in my eyes. No invasive embalming and viewings and caskets... just $10000 rupees and ashes to ashes."

Take a walk over the bridge and up the steps and walk towards the space where you can sit and look out over the whole remarkable site. Worth also visiting the ashram, and the adjacent old people's home. Non Hindus can see into the temple to Lord Shiva by leaving the site.

The taxi driver on the way back explained that these sadus are not real ( they are simply Indian people who have come here to dress up as a form of begging) and that nearly all the people selling stuff and begging are Indian too. I must say, I have never come across Nepali people as pushy or intimidating at all, so I have no reason not to believe this is the case. Tourists beware - it is an amazing place but to be avoided if you don't want a constant stream of \" in your face\" begging.

Never in my life did I expect to see bodies of the deceased put on stretchers over a roaring fire and burnt until the body disintegrated in flames, but that is exactly what I saw at the Crematoria in Kathmandu. Very interesting to see how the fire is built and straw is washed before adding it to the fire so as to be pure. The cremation that happens before the eyes of loved ones. The final honor; the final exit. You can't help but be affected by the ceremony, next to the river, out in the open. So in tune with how we live our lives."

Even though The Cremotoria is a place where the dead are put to rest, I thought it would be beautiful to see how the Nepalese say goodbye to their lost loves, see what kind of rituals they have, and to witness their views on death but I didn't feel peace when I was there. Watching families cry in pain on the river bank, watching their deceased burn, in the open public felt wrong. It felt as if we were invaded a sacred private moment, the last moment people have to their mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, cousins, and friends. There is little steps set out into the river bank and there burning stations about every 20 feet, so cremations are going on right next to one another. Aside from the act of the cremations, there is beggars, homeless, hustlers, and creeps.. Everywhere! Every step you take theirs either someone trying to relentlessly sell you something, peeing in public, following you for money, or sleeping on the floor next to you. It felt invasive in the first place to be at funerals uninvited, but the loitering crowd that hangs out around there made us feel uncomfortable, unsafe, and unsettled. If you see pictures of this place I feel like that would be enough for you. But if you really must go experience this for yourself, just be on guard."

Days prior my visit my friend died so this tour offered me the PERFECT opportunity to pray for her soul. I asked a Holy Man to perform the Shradh Ceremony on me on her behalf and we did it at the foot of the river. It was an enlightening, emotional experience. Since the water is polluted with burned human remains it's a biohazard so I had to clean myself up a lot when I got to the hotel but the experience was worth it and I hope the ceremony has served its purpose and brought my friend safely to the afterlife."

Whilst it seems a strange place to visit we wanted to experience all what this culture has to offer. On entering the facility we were filled with apprehension. However after a short time, and the senerity and calmness of everybody we really started to understand. We saw many families saying goodbye to their loved ones by firstly washing the deceased face, then moving them to the cremation. No outpouring of grief was experienced just a calm and loving goodbye. a very dignified ending. Take some time to meet with the 'holy men' in their 'temples' opposite and have great photos taken . We left feeling relaxed about what we had seen. But I guess not for everybody, but dont be concerned about visiting..."

A friend brought us here. He had arranged for university student studying anthropology to be our guide. Just part of the tourist economics in Nepal. People make their own arrangements. We were fortunate.The site is split by a river. On one side is were the the family of the deceased goes through the ritual process preparing the body for cremation and the actual burning takes place. On the the opposite side are the tourists, monks, holyman and boys, and observers. There are a number of sites along a wharf like restraining wall where each cremation takes place. There a number in process in different stages. Our guide told us that the cremation can take 7-8 hours to complete.After the fire has consumed the remains the ashes are pushed into the river. The site bisected along the axis of the river into the royal and rich section, up stream and the economy section (lower cost). It was an emotional experience, you felt like you were intruding on a private matter and you were. Family members were very emotional and outgoing, oblivious to all of the people watching from the other side of the water.The holy men an boys were pure carnival. Their elaborate makeup, clothing, and antics made for good theater and seemed out of place. They want to be paid for everything. Using my 300mm lens to record a group of these men that appeared to taking a break and talking, seemed innocent until one spotted me and they all started running to close the 100+ feet wanting to be paid. I shook the first ones hand and then showed them a picture of a monkey on a rooftop I had taken earlier. I felt like I scammed the scammers.We thanked our guide and gave him the aged upon gratuity."

It's like hell and paradise... Full power!I can recommend to go there at night with many reasons: 1. There no people, no tourists, no sellers, no fake-sadhu. Just almost nobody.

Both rivers are considered suitable holy rivers for the ashes of beloved family members to be transmuted into the incorruptible and be born away by the river to the vast Ocean waters from which we came. It is emblematic of the consciousness leaving the physical body and merging with the Super Consciousness which we are told never dies because it was never created. It simply IS, and we are a part. Many cultures and religions use this method of dealing with the human vessel of the consciousness especially in areas where the ground is too hard by sun or ice-.This method gives a sense of completion on many levels. The family is able to give their attention to the deceased,and fulfill the necessary religious rituals.This advances the process of grieving and allows healing of the mind and emotions to commence. I had become ill in Deli and flew to the nearest bathroom.There was a large rat there with the longest yellow teeth I had ever seen. Our eyes met. His were hopeful +gleaming.

Poor soul I thought. Making his way to be cremated. All of a sudden he waved a bony hand. my God I thought. He is not dead. Then I was informed that he was being taken to the hospital round the corner. Puts a twist on the old saying. In the midst of death we are in life. Go and watch in reverence. Remember nothing in the universe is permanent. Namaste"

We visit the Crematoria , on 2 January 2015 , in part of the historical city tour arranged by Outshine Adventures.The history was told by our knowledgeable Nepali guide ,Mr Prasant.The Crematoria is located beside the Bagmati river, in the Pashupatinath temple complex.This site is a very important for the Nepal and India people ,many people arrive here to find shelter ,wait for the the last several weeks of their lives, to meet death.Bodies of the dead also brought here ,with cleaning and mourning rituals,could be seen.Later they be cremated on the banks of the river and travel their last journey with the waters of the sacred river Bagmati, which later meets the holy river Ganges. This is a place, with special atmosphere of death, death is present in almost every ritual and every sight in here.This place might not a place for everybody.We witnessed the crematory, mourning ,bathing process of the deceased , from the riverbank just opposite the crematoria , and the Pashupatinath main temple.A religious ,cultural and sacred place to be , we feel moved when watching the whole process , in fact , its the 1st open air crematory process we witnessed in our lifetime.Hopefully this magnificent area are spared during the earthquake and the aftershocks."

In the West this process would be very private and personal...not so in the Hindu religion. They take the bodies to a cremation spot on the river at the holy site (next to the temple) to cremate the bodies in public. There are stands set up to view and photograph this process and the family members are well aware and not offended by the recording of this ceremony. However, I will say it was a bit disturbing watching this in person from Western Eyes. The bodies are cremated 3-48 hrs after death and the eldest son or male in the family conducts the ceremony. The body is prepared and set on a cremation platform and burned until there are only ashes and no recognizable body parts. The family member walks around the body three times with the flame in hand and the fire is started in the mouth. The cremation usually takes about 3 hours for full consumption. After the cremation the ashes (and anything left) is swept into the river. The other seemingly strange thing about this is, there are young men that comb the silt (the river is very shallow and barely moving) beneath the cremation platforms to recover any gold (mostly from dental work) or jewelry not consumed by the fire. There's another set of young men that recover the charred wood from the river and take it to the brick furnaces. The cremation cost 10 dollars on the right side of the bridge and 20 dollars on the left side of the bridge because it's closer to temple. The cremations go on 24hrs a day and there are always bodies waiting to be cremated."

Everyone was watching something going on below. I couldn't curb my curiosity and I also tried to look down.What I saw filled me with mixed feelings. After a while I realised that my eyes were moist. Some politician's mother had died and the whole family had gathered there. I watched the whole ceremony starting from giving a wash to the departed body and then some religious rituals before the body is put on a pyre, decorated with bright yellow marigold flowers. A person who was loved by many, who had a life, was no more there. There was fire, high flames and a bunch of people who were crying and hugging each other; and a whole lot of onlookers who had gathered around the area to watch the last journey.I came out of the temple feeling humbled, I was quiet, I had witnessed the eternal truth!A visit to Crematoria is worth giving a go if you believe in life and death!"

As soon as I got there to visit the place, I was informed that the entrance fee was 1.000 NPR which correspond more or less to U$10.00. It\u2019s a quite high value for Nepalese standards. According to the banner attached at the counter, this charged value would be used for renovation and maintenance of the Temple and Monuments. I understand it but, I cannot understand why just tourists have to pay this entrance fee. A guide explained to me that local people don\u2019t pay because they do voluntary job there. It became in my mind a perfect excuse to rip off tourists since I\u2019m sure that almost anybody in Kathmandu is working for free there. I refused paying this abuse and came back to my hostel frustrated. If you want to see a Crematory, go to India (Varanasi). A week ago I saw a huge Crematory for free."

The body has to be cremated within 24 hours. The eldest son of the family performs the cremation ceremony. The cries of the family members were heart-wrenching. Even though I don't know them, my tears fell and at that moment I felt strange and awkward taking pictures of the ceremony. A few hours later the ashes were collected and swept in the river.

There are two cremation areas - basic platforms and \"no frills\" for commoners, and an area for more affluent people, with more ceremony and ritual.There was no sign of grief or drama, as the cremations seemed to be conducted more as a final formality and farewell before rebirth.A most worthwhile visit, which gives an enhanced understanding of local culture and thought. At no stage did our presence feel unwelcome or out of place - we were simply observers (amongst a few hundred others) quietly observing part of life's cycle.An important part of the Kathmandu \"experience\"."

If you spend a significant amount of time here, you are likely to witness all stages of the ritual....This has been going on thoughout generations of Hindus, but I noticed one radical modern aspect...when one man was using his smartphone to record a video of the deceased as they set the cremation fire.Westerners can expect to pay a relatively high fee to gain access to the complex, but it's worth the price to gain a deeper understanding of the culture."

            "review": "So interesting to see how other cultures view death!. First of all, I must say I agree with a previous review that the Crematoria is a sacred place which has nothing morbid about the Hindu practice of cremation and what it embodies. It provides a unique sight, rarely experienced by Westerners. The Crematoria is within the complex of the Pashupatinath Temple. A fascinating site, an open air crematorium where you can learn about the Hindu way of dealing with the departed ones; a large and well kept ancient complex of temples, stupas, and old buildings sitting on the river Bagmati where a traveller can get a good eye-view of the cremation process of a Hindu believer. Also an interesting place to learn a bit about the Hindu and Nepali culture. Ceremony: Impossible to describe it! You need to prepare yourself for this experience and be aware that you might find what you see difficult for the Western eye (Western sensibility can be deeply touched as it can be a bit disturbing for Western eyes). Bodies are brought here within the first few hours of death to be cremated; all the family gather round and help to prepare the bodies before they are cremated. According to the rank of the dead person, the body is cremated in the respective ghat. Families share their grief, come together and prepare their loved one for the next journey. In this cultural and spiritual ceremony the feet of the bodies are unwrapped and washed in the holy waters of the above mentioned river. After that, bodies are decorated with flowers and powder. Some holy milk from the temple is poured into the dead\u2019s mouth and after the performance of the family rituals, the bodies are placed on the fire stand (pyres). Bodies, covered in wood, take around 5 to completely cremate. Afterwards, the ashes are pushed and scattered into the holy river. Last but not least, young boys search the river waters for gold and other metals that did not burn.Westerners don't seem to accept death as part of living; Hindus see it as a sacred end. So, this is an excellent opportunity to learn about the Hindu way of returning and disposing the \"empty shell\" (the human body) where it belongs to. Photography: cremations are a very moving affair. Observed all the goings with due respect and decorum, discreetly. I took no photos, as I felt it was rude to intrude. I hate tourists who despite being told not to take photos take their huge zoom lens intruding into families\u2019 grief. It is really irritating for me to observe those who clearly prioritize a photo to show the friends and relatives back home than to a human being's pain.If you choose not to pay the entrancee fee, as a non-Hindus you may observe the cremations and preceding ceremonies from a close vantage point across the river. Absolutely worthwhile as they are so different from our closed doors burials! Not for the faint of heart, though. One may feel terribly impressed here. An amazing cultural, touching and spiritual experience! A heart moving site to the Western traveller. An interesting glimpse of another culture. A cultural curiosity, an eye opener. Not confronting, just outside our experience. I really learnt a lot.Give yourself ample time and indeed hire a site guide (some with faultless English) who may have much to offer (Non Hindus normally may not get to see these rituals anywhere else. I would strongly advise a guide for a better and further understanding and appreciation of Hindu way of life). Great to see how another religion deals with death. Absolutely worthwhile if you want a cultural lesson, a learning experience. Not for the light \u2013 hearted as I said before. A life experience! I felt privileged. Touching, moving. A deeply recommended spiritual place. Certainly educational, indeed. A must see to understand this ancestral culture! Westerners, watch out! We have much to learn!"

Anyway this is a large and very well kept ancient complex of temples, stupas, and old buildings and sits on the river. The Golden temple is on a hill overlooking the river. This is a fascinating site because you can watch and even photograph the city's dead as they are washed and prepared for cremation. A little further along on the river are the cremation pyres and you can follow the procession of the body from the washing to the cremation. It is a large site to explore and some of the buildings sit along a gorge so it is very scenic too. It is similar to Varanasi in India but this place is far better kept and far more beautiful."

Once again, if you've been to somewhere like Varanasi then you're not going to be terribly impressed here.The first thing that hits you is that there's hardly any water in the river - this is apparently due to the Nepalese goverment - so we were told. So you've got a fairly empty river filled with sand bags trying to direct the trickle of water that's left. And what you're left with is stagnant polluted water filled with ashes and debris which should be flowing away 'to a better world' - but is actually only travelling a few metres. It's not exactly the Ganges.Despite tourists being told not to take photos of those that have died, you'll still probably be irritated by someone with a huge zoom lens intruding into a families grief. Clearly it's better for some to get a photo to show the folks back home than care about someone's pain.Guides will most likely take you here in the daytime - but there is no atmosphere. You really want to be here from around 7pm when there's music and chanting and various other rituals. Only then will you experiece some magic.What I found incredibly sad about this place - and a real wake-up call - was to see children glue-sniffing, and others chain-smoking. It is quite bizarre to see families in grief with the loss of a loved one, while amongst them are kids sniffing glue out of polythene bags, and their parents high on other substances. It would appear that this is a place where those that are hooked on substances also come to sleep at night, as to be honest, I've not seen these people here in the daytimes. So it's your call when you would prefer to visit.I love to see the sadhus - but please accept that the sadhus here are fakes - these are people who dress up to make money out of tourists. But that's fine as long as you accept what's going on. Regardless, they make great photos.Also, if you are not a Hindu then you have to accept you're not going to see the best of what is available. You will not be allowed inside the best temples. So really you're only getting a peek of what is available and going on.If I had not been to far better holy places I would have scored this area higher, as this is exactly the type of experience I like to have in such countries. But the truth is that there are better places, more spiritual places, and more atmospheric places. And ALL of them come alive at night. But if this is your first holy place it's not a bad for a starter, but it is rather limited. PLUS, this is the only holy place I've been to in the world where I've had to pay an entry fee - and a high one at that. Shame the Nepalese goverment aren't plowing all the money they are making out of tourists and putting it back into the community..."

The Crematoria is located within the larger complex of the Pashupatinath Temple. We went not knowing anything about the site, but a young, polite, well spoken Nepalese student came up to chat. I expected he'd eventually tell us he worked as a guide and would ask if we would like him to explain the site. He was such a nice kid we agreed and spent the next several hours learning about the temples and the Hindu practice of cremation. We saw nothing remotely close to what one reviewer suggested might be considered \"morbid\". Male members of families genitally wash the body of their love one following a sacred protocol and move it to where the spirit is released by cremation. Male sons perform the sacred rights which include them entering the temple after cremation and remaining in solitude for 13-days. One year from the sacred passage the they return to perform a second period of solitude. It is not possible to watch without feeling heartfelt sorrow for the families and reflect on the more typical western approach to burial where we saturate our love ones with formaldehyde, place them in a box and lock their spirit 2 metres underground. Soaring with eagles makes more sense. We have much to learn. The site is large, give yourself ample time and indeed hire a site guide they have much to offer."
