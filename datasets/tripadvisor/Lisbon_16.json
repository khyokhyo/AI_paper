Lots of nooks and crannies to wander through and locate a variety of stores, restaurants, pastelarias, and small hotels. Seems quite safe at night but watch for the rowdy tourist coming out of the bars!!I loved just wandering the streets....especially the narrow ones. Lots of hills and steps abound.....just let yourself wander... we came upon a Fado singer and sat outside the restaurant to listen.... neat area to explore...especially, at night!"

It is either climb up or climb down if on foot, which is the only way to see it. We walked 4+ miles and it was challenging for a couple of seniors but worth a visit. On your own, you might stroll more but not know the significance of the sites. Lots of cafes, bars and shops."

Although we were and early arrival for our room we did not have to wait long to gain access which was especially welcome after a long overseas flight. Our Queen bedroom was small but well maintained. Bathroom was exquisite with lovely towels and fine toiletries. The hotel faces a busy square but with the windows and balcony door closed we did not hear a thing and had a restful sleep. The restaurant was excellent - food and service and the roof top terrace bar offers great views. Upon checking out there was a discrepancy between the rate charged and the confirmed rate from our travel agent. Reception let us pay the rate as quoted by our travel agent and indicated that if there was any discrepancy they would charge the additional after verifying. They were very pleasant and non-confrontational which eased the situation. ( In the end the rate quoted by our travel agent was honoured so we were delighted that no additional charges were levied. )"

Of all the areas of Lisbon we visited this was by far the most lively.Packed with people, more on the young side. Little cafes & pubs, street vendors and artists. FADO venues tucked in little narrow cobblestone alleys. I think about it and wish I had the opportunity to spend more time there. It was late September when we were there and the University students in their Harry Potter type capes were everywhere! So interesting."

It has one of the best views of the city. you can also take the funicular from the Praca dos Restauradores. The Belevedere also has local artisans and painters as well as vendors that will sell you cold drinks and coffee. From this spot to the right of the Belvedere you may take the Cable Car down but first I suggest that you visit the Port Wine Museum which is directly across the street and then visit the wonderful Sao Roque Church. The painted wood, false-domed ceiling is perfectly flat. Also find the St. John the Baptist Altar. It was used once at the Vatican, they dismantled and brought ti this church."

We first visited the Barro Alto while on a food/drink walking tour of Lisbon and enjoyed the vibe and eclectic nature of the area of the city. We came back one evening to visit the area at night and try out a local restaurant and take in a Fado show. We walked around the area and found a great restaurant to have a light snack in before taking in a Fado show and supper at another restaurant. If you are going to Lisbon this area is a must visit. The only warning is make sure you have the ability to climb up one of the large hills in Lisbon to get up to Barro Alto and if you have limited mobility take the escalator up there or a cab ride."

At night, it buzzes with people, but not in an invasive way. People love going out in Lisbon, they love to mingle, and because all these little bars are small, people tend to stay outside to have a chat and a good time. A student told us \"if you asked me to give you the name of a single bar, I couldn't, not because I drink too much, but because everyone is outside\". It's not just for students as many places also have very nice and typical restaurants, some very trendy, some on the classical side with Fado singers that you need to book in advance for week-ends.Don't miss it!!!"

That is an experience in itself. Remember to load a tap card and use this when paying for metro, funicular, trams, etc. As it's much cheaper (and easier). I roamed the streets and found a restaurant (there are many). The view of Lisbon at night is wonderful from up here.Just be warned that some of the metro stops close after 8:30 so you have to go to one of the larger metro stops such as at one of the squares."

The atmosphere is just great, and I loved finding little tiny bars and clubs filled to the brim, spilling out onto the streets with all kinds of people, just having fun. I got to go to a number of different places all in one night, which was just awesome. So many cool small little places that I discovered - don't be afraid to ask some of the locals where the best places to go are. Lots of little places that are sort of hidden and such ended up being some of the coolest bars that I've ever visited - not just in Lisbon, but in general. One of my favorite nights while travelling ever. Highly recommend. This an absolute must-do while in Lisbon."

Take the Elevator from Baixa, if you don't find a large queue, and look from the view point the amazing panoramic view of the city (best time of the day to visit it, is the sunset). We stopped at the first restaurant as we exit the Elevator, great food and the best white sangria I've ever tasted.

It's basically several blocks of bars and restaurants. Generally, everyone is packed out on the streets enjoying their drinks and smokes, basically just hanging out. Seems like most people just go into the bars to get their drinks and then head back out onto the streets. Feels kind of like Mardi Gras but on a smaller scale and much less music. No need to tip the bartenders as tipping is not a thing in Portugal but if you're feeling generous, go ahead. Some of the bartenders were quite surprised I had even left them a little extra.People tend to flock to the bars with cheaper drinks. I started off at one bar when mojitos were 6 Euros and a large glass of Super Bock beer was 3 Euros. Only as I walked around Bairro Alto did I realize that other bars were selling cocktails at 2 for 3 Euros with 1 Euro beers. So if you want a cheap drink, prepare to wait, otherwise, head to one of the lesser crowded bars where likely the drinks will cost a little more.It can get really crowded at night. Like shoulder to shoulder crowded so secure your wallets and bags as we all know how pickpocketing is such a rampant crime in Europe. Also, a lot of drug dealers will be going around trying to sell you their wares. They're harmless but the constant touting gets a bit annoying. I was pretty surprised at how open they were about selling. Turns out drugs are illegal in Portugal but it's been decriminalized meaning you'd likely just get slapped with a fine."

You'll also find a great many street pedlars touting their various wares with a great mix of locals and tourists alike.Too many restaurants here take advantage of the high foot traffic, charging high prices for cuisine that can be found for better value and higher quality outside of this area. The staff in a number of the bars here also seem to be impatient of the tourists and don't reflect the friendly attitude you'll find everywhere else in Portugal."

Bairro has a very lively bar scene and the neighbourhood really wakes up in the evening. There are lots of excellent restaurant in Bairro. There is a very nice park nearby called Jardim do Princip Real (including a great kids park). There is very good shopping. We loved having the small local 'frutarias' around (aka corner stores) which seem to have everything that my superstore back home has but in the tiniest of spaces! Many have very fresh produce and the prices are great! The hardest part of staying in Bairro was that you are \"alto\" which meant that at the end of each day we had to ascend a big hill with kids in tow to get back to our apartment. The upside of this is you get the great views from the nearby miradouro (lookout)! Subway access also is not available in Bairro, you will need to walk down the hill about 10-15 minutes walk to get to the nearest station. Of course, tuktuk, tram and taxi access is also available for those who choose not to walk to their destination.We did not want to leave Bairro Alto - absolutely loved it!"

Overall, it was pretty and we had a nice view, but I would say had little of interest for children and for us it was more a route to another destination than a place to hang out or shop. I won't drag the kids up the hill again and would not recommend it as a walk for young children."

Lisbon night comes to live here. It can get really crowded though so be prepared for the noise, cause here everyone drinks out on the streets. Chat on the streets. Laughs on the streets. Its like a big open bar :) not the place you want to be if you want to sleep at night though, local experience :) well i did lived here and got used to it but if you are here for just some days it might be something to consider. Now really, my favorite part of the day here is really late afternoon. The light hits the street in a different way, the esplanades come to live, you can feel the neighborhood waking up as the others start to calm down. And its the perfect timing to discover the great shops around here!! If you walk through rua do loreto, look for Adamastor, a great viewpoint to the river with esplanades and an incredible chill out mood to it! The best disco in town is a bit down bellow, Incognito bar. Great place!"

Any restaurant is a good choice as long as they offer Fado, because that's the real joy of the experience. Not to undercut the food, you must try the green soup (Caldo verde) which is much more delicious than it looks. If you have enough wine, you will find yourself trying to join in with the locals as everyone is encouraged to sing the local Fado traditional songs that every local resident seems to know."

Having that in mind it will be easier to realize why is all their nightlife happening on the streets of Bairro Alto instead in the bars there. The bars are really small so they just buy the drink inside an step outside to sing and talk to each other. From midnight till 02.30 or 03 am the streets of Bairro Alto are crowded with people so much you can barely walk. The best days for visiting are Thursday, Friday and Saturday. But other days are fine also.Most of the bars are super cheap, We drank cocktails of 0.8L which are really good for only 6 euros. Here you can find bars that sell beers for only 1 euro. I can't remember all the bars we visited because we visited maybe 7 but I can remember the great atmosphere and the energy. "

Lisbon has a common, but unfair claim....that it is a budget traveller's dream spot.... Be that as it may, we listen intently to our guide who points out the spindling tower of of the basilica at the end of the park. He quipps-on... \"i am not going to force you to go into a church... we have about 180 of them, but if you wish to visit, it's free. Chugging around the city in the back of an ancient pseudo-jeep, built by the Portuguese, the emphasis is on sharing local knowledge rather then traipsing through a predictable highlights reel. We are given a rundown on where the best bifanas are... those greasy, but naughty pork sandwiches and see impromptu fado music performances without tourist-trap entrance fees..... the guide carries on... don't buy drinks from a bar, just get cheep beers from a convenience stor and pour it into a plastic cup as you wander the streets. Count me out of this cheep option! But the reason why we all come here is the hedonistic lifestyle, its novelty transport including trams and funicular railways up the steep hills. Transport is essential but what a bonus en route... Metro Art, specially commissioned tile art inside them turning a trip into a gallery hop. My favourite is The Parque and my femm's.. The Oriente..... this love of tiles leads one to The Museo Nacional Do Azulejo for the world's most extraordinary collection. It covers the history of Portugal's signature artform with a church built around the museum that is jaw-dropping masterpiece. For us, the wine tastings on Praca do Comercio, Lisbon's main square is a highlight, testing samplings, at about 75 cents of the countries best vino regions. Who can resist a flee market? this place called Feira Da ladra is more about socialising then serious shopping. The quality is iffy, but people watching gets five stars. There is no getting away from it, Lisbon is a sponge for the youthful spirit of everyone"

We walked and used the tram on them first day , sat in the sun at lovely coffee shops and restaurants , the coffee and fresh pastries were delicious and if you keep out of main squares very cheap. Second day we hired bikes for two days and cycled the designated paths all along the coast . You can catch a ferry for around a pound with your bike across to the other side of Lisbon, wow the beaches there are amazing, a real surfers paradise. You can get a big glass of wine for \u00a31.20 , a great meal for a fiver. I will definitely return , in my opinion it knocks spots of Barcelona"

Be prepared for the crowds at certain times, but this is what makes the area fun. Lots of restaurants, pubs and shops. Prices are from reasonable to pricey, depending on what type of food you want to try. Great place to try a variety of Portuguese foods. Very hilly as you can see by the pictures. You can ride the trolleys, but they do get crowded with tourists and I assume locals using them as well. Overall just fun to wander and hang out!"

Every single member of staff were absolutely fantastic respectful and courteous. This was our first visit to Portugal and we were unsure what to expect from the people. We should not have worried, they are genuinely a warm and friendly race - not only in the Hotel but in the local shops and restaurants. The hotel, which was in a perfect central location for access to the old and new town, was clean and nicely laid out and decorated. The bathroom was enormous with all the facilities you could need. The bed was very comfortable with choices of bedding and pillows for those with allergies. We were particularly pleased with the downstairs bar which we were able to smoke in!! (weather was not great on our Valentines break). Only thing missing from the room offering was a coffee machine, but there was a fully stocked mini bar and bottled water provided free of charge. Our breakfast experience was also good, with options for light or cooked breakfast fresh from the kitchen. Our Valentines day evening meal was in the Hotel restaurant and the food wine and service were out of this world!! A very nice touch to be greeted by name when you said your room number. The staff are by far and away the best we have ever experienced for their good humour but at the same time respectful approach. We cannot remember individual names unfortunately but they were all keen to engage in conversation, especially about english football!! They recommended local restaurants which were just awesome, and really sealed our enjoyment of the whole visit. We had pre-booked a tuk-tuk from Eco-tours for a 'one to one' tour of the city. Our guide who was called Enrique, was so knowledgeable and spoke perfect English, he was patient and didnt rush us along, and we even got to sample some local delicacies and drinks. It was a day to remember and a city break we will long remember thanks to the genuine warmth and courtesy we received from all we met, but especially the wonderful staff at the Bairro Alto Hotel. One word of warning is that it is a very hilly City and some of the streets are very steep, this did not affect our enjoyment in any way, but if you have difficulty walking, it could be a challenge! In any case this location and Hotel are both highly recommended - dont think twice just book it!!"

Electrifying atmosphere with bars buzzing with people all around and playing live music. You can do your own pub crawl with so many options close by. Every pub is trying to match the price offered by others, so you can get shots for like 1 EUR as well. Quite a easy reach and on the way of the classic Tram 28E. You might be surprised with people asking you to buy drugs at the place, so beware of that. The streets are Cobbled and uneven with lots of highs and lows , which definitely demands easy walking shoes and not heels. But a must try place in the evenings, if you are planning Lisbon!!"

We got a beautiful traditional Portuguese mealThe first night and then went to two other small bars for cocktails afterwards. Bairro Alto has over 250 bars and restaurants so there is lots of variety and great value for money. Be warned it is very hilly and the cobble is extremely uneven. Don't make my mistake and leave the heels at home it's better to be comfortable here.  To men in particular be prepared to be harassed by men selling cocaine and hash. On one narrow street on Saturday night my boyfriend was asked if he wanted to buy drugs 8 times. I wish we had been pre warnedOf that as it really turned us off the area and we left quickly after that. "

Right across the Funicular stop, the Port Institute was an interesting stop and to the right, Miraduro de Sao Pedro de Alcantara provided a very nice terrace for taking nice photos of rooftops and the castle. In a small lane to the right, I found least expensive souvenirs in the city (probably because this is out of the way). While going down, I found a very cozy and small restaurant (Papo Cheio). It was clear that local inhabitants come here to watch football games on TV, chat with Papo Cheio behind the counter and eat their excellent meals. I was the only foreigner in the restaurant, they didn\u2019t speak English, but had an English menu. It was easy to walk into the residential area of Bairo Alto to the right and weave down to Rua Garrett. This is a slightly steep walk down with Church de Sao Roque on the left, followed by a very nice gallery and famous Cervejaria da Trinidade, also on the left. This area of Lisbon is great for just walking around, if not for eating, drinking and shopping."

In daylight this bohemian district is a sleepy place, hungover from the previous night, with not much going on except for the shops down Rua do Norte. When the sun sets a new life begins, with restaurants opening their doors, and crowds showing up to spend their bar-hopping night. The bars are small, forcing everyone to spill out onto the streets and creating a street party atmosphere. Rua da Atalaia, Rua do Di\u00e1rio de Noticias and Rua da Barroca become filled with caipirinha-sipping crowds, most under 40, but mixing different urban tribes, straight and gay. It's a place inhabited by old ladies and young artsy hipsters, giving it a vibe that is simultaneously old-fashioned and avant-garde, a shabby-chic neighborhood that really needs no name. It's simply the \"bairro,\" the neighborhood where everything happens -- at night. Crossing the street (Cal\u00e7ada do Combro) you step into the small Bica neighborhood, known for its famous funicular. This is another picturesque neighborhood that goes down the hill, together with neighboring Santa Catarina which is known for its lookout terrace."

I would rather recommend the nightclubs along the beach which have a sense of sophistication and sexyness that I've not experienced before."

The streets can be very steep so wear your walking shoes. I can't remember the street but we ran across a wonder section where there were portraits of people who live there posted on the walls along the street. It was a wonderful introduction to local living in this area. Also, look out for some great wall murals. We found one about fado music that was so beautiful that I used it on coffee mugs and t-shirt family gifts."

These tiny and small streets are the most typicall things in Lisbon! During the night, this place is full of life, bars, clubs places to drink whataver you want. Suggestion: If you are more than 40 and travel with your family, this is a typicall place to have dinner but not to go out because its too crowded. If you are travelling with friends and if you want to have a piece of the vibrant Lisbon nightlife, you've found your place!"

I\u2019m putting this review under Bairro Alto, which we enjoyed wandering through to find the Carmo church. Definitely take the funicular up to Bairro Alto. Avoid the super touristic Santa Justa Elevator with its endless lines. This medieval Church of Santa Maria do Carmo, founded in 1389, was ruined in the 1755 earthquake while congregants were attending mass. At the time it was the largest church in Lisbon. Now the gothic arches open to the sky in amazing beauty. Reconstruction of the church started in 1756 and ended in 1834, when the religious orders were abolished in Portugal.Today you can wander through the exterior with open arches and walls. A museum, located at the site of the original main altar, displays sculptures from old ruined buildings and items found in the rubble from the earthquake. The scope of the small museum is impressive; it even includes South American mummies."

At night this continues, but even walking back from dinner late in the evening, the area felt safe.The only downside was that sometimes it was a bit noisy in the apartment, but we felt that was a reasonable price to pay for being in the heart of things.Love this area - would certainly stay here again when we come back to Lisbon"

There are many restaurants and bars but not so many that it gets overly raucous. At its heart, it is a residential area with cobblestone streets and the occasional street art on the walls. Be prepared to walk the many streets and alleys with their ups and downs. Wear good shoes, but you probably know that if you know Lisbon. Beautiful city and this area was wonderful for us to stay in.It is much quieter in general than in the busier Alfama area, so it really depends on your style. That being said, there are still the Fado bars, and many good restaurants to choose from.Apartment rentals are inexpensive and can be found through VRBO or Home Away. We found a nice one on Rue Vinha, and really liked the location. The street was quiet and all locals except us. But we were literally 2-3 short blocks from finding pastry shops and restaurants. We felt we had the best of both worlds.It is an easy walk down the hills to the main parts of the city. And you do get used to the walks back up surprisingly enough. All in all, the Barrio Alto worked out really well for us."

There are loads of bars, cafes, fado houses and restaurants, masked by day but coming alive at night.

Many bars still empty at 22:30 ,drinks frequently sold by size. Smoking inside some bars, you can usually take drinks outside from bars and these served in plastic.

In a wider European context it has a charming nightlife setting with its narrow streets, trams, hilly terrain, public squares and terraces. The action and parties last late into the night; no wonder it seems relatively quiet during the daytime. As long as you venture deep into Bairro Alto\u2014away from Chiado\u2014it won't take long to find the bustling bars.I visited as a student and it was very cheap for nightlife. You can get drinks like cocktails or treble shots for barely a few euros. Bairro Alto is very lively and it can take some time to traverse because of the number of people that can spill outdoors. In terms of nightlife much of the area didn't strike me as particularly touristic, which makes for a nice experience with the locals!"

Shops and restaurants are wedged into odd assortments of doorways. Graffiti and tags cover some walls. Bunting loops across streets. The buildings themselves will sometimes stun you with their delicacy or details, bright pastel walls or tile work, popping up unexpectedly as you walk up and down the hilly passages. Because this is a university sector, occupied by foreign students, too, during their Erasmus year (exchange program), rents are kept very low by law and prices in shops and cafes can be substantially lower than down in the Comercio or Rossio areas. While up in the Alto, visit the Praca Luis de Camoes then cross over to the Chiado section to Largo de Carmo, a pocket park offering absolutely stunning views of the old city, the Alfama hills, and the castle."

Listen...You can and you will wisit a lot of things in this worm, crazy, beautiful city.But, if you wont a taste of real, pure Lisboa- go to restorant \" O Cantinho do bem estar\", on Bairro Alto. It is in the Rua da Norta. Small place, suggested by locals. Unbelievable great dishes, energy, quality. We went there 3 times- first we ate a fish- so fresh and so gooood! But, we wonted to test this little worm place with meat! Belive me- it is the taste of heaven! Don' t forget good house wine!! And the price? Hey! Crazy, but true- it is unexpectedly cheap!One of the first thing I'll remember from Lisboa."

Yes, this is party central for natives of Lisbon and for visitors. It stays open until 3 or 4 in the morning for partying. During the day, it is very charming. It is hilly so wear good footwear. Lots to see and experience here. Get a good map of this area of central Lisbon as you can get lost easily. It is connected to other areas as well and easy to find with a good map.

The buildings offer that essential Portuguese image of decorative tile fronted properties, that give it a kind of fantasy feel. While there are many small, tucked away eateries, offering traditional as well as modern Mediterranean menus.

Quiet and quaint by day (the buildings date back to the 1500s apparently) the narrow pavered streets come alive at night, with people drinking in the streets and a different watering hole every 10 feet (even on weekdays the party goes until 2 a.m.). However I found that the overall atmosphere was convivial and safe, unlike what it might be here in the States.There is something for everyone here, from tiki bars to hole-in-the-wall fado and everything in between. If you enjoy partying, it will be like Christmas every day for you here."

It seems to be an old district with corresponding character so it is probably no wonder it attracts crowds. Then again, this is partly what summer is about - mixing and mingling and simply having a good time. We had a dinner in some Portuguese restaurant and drinks in several bars nearby. After a hot day it was really refreshing. Even if getting to the place requires some muscle - \"alto\" means \"high\" after all. But it is well worth the effort."

After some very annoying hard-sell professionals pushing us into overpriced dinner/show combos, we decided to just have dinner in a street restaurant and enjoy the environment. During dinner, near a busy crossroad, we observed multiple people lingering, following tourists closely, returning, and repeating. I assumed these were pickpockets, but didn't really know. At any rate, if I returned, I would do more research, skip the tourist madness, and try to find some authentic Portuguese fare and entertainment."

There are some lovely bars, cafes and restaurants to suit all types of traveler, you really get the feel for Lisbon city life. There is a but.. From time to time in the city ( Central Lisbon) we were offered canabis, cocaine or grass. Usually when I sad \"no\" the vendor took the hint. However on one night this one individual keep hassling us to buy cocaine. He kept following us and tried to get between me and my partner, we eventually had to go into a bar to avoid him, he even waited outside for ten minuets until he gave up. I have traveled for many years and I know dealers will try to sell to tourists in city's, I am not naive but be respectful if someone says \"no!\" Lisbon authorities take note!"

The prices for most of these restaurants are reasonable as well since Lisbon isn't too expensive compared to other European cities. The thing I really liked most about this area and Lisbon in general, is how nice people are. It was so refreshing after being in Spain where people aren't big fans of tourists, especially in Barcelona. Customer service is wonderful, even the guards at the airports are just so nice.

At one stage as my partner had gone to the bar and I was in view of the window 4 of them gathered and stared in at me making nose signals indicating did I want drugs, I tried to ignore them and turned slightly but I felt extremely nervous then and wanted to just get out of the area as quickly as possible. If the police were more present the area may be somewhere I\u2019d recommend as it is quirky and different but after my personal experience I wouldn\u2019t go back..."

The crowded, narrow streets going uphill, covered in cobble stone, the architecture (so much Portuguese ceramic), churches, spaces to be explored, people to run into, pickpockets, kids playing football and old ladies hanging clothes. It's authentic, not sugar-coated, a living area in the city, where the traditional and the new confront and colllide. Ive fund my dealers,some very well read kids, who lured me first by playing loud some french rap on their smartphone. I approached them, had some Brock beer (the kids were Sporting Lisbon fans) and we shared a spliff as the sun went down. What a day. It's the rough area of the city, but still not as rough as Alfama or Amadora, on the city limits."

WHEN ..as a tourist, we begin to tire of the tried and true path of shopping stores and regular sites, slightly off the beaten track are the places the locals go to or live in--such is the Bairro Alto. On the walls as you enter are the famous and infamous of the neighborhoods as well as prints on the walls of some of the local elderly. This area is considered home to the birthplace of Fado and has several buildings that used to be homes or ill repute (brothels) it is from these racy surroundings that some of the greatest voices of Fado emerged, their own lives full of the drama and tragedy that gives Fado its fervor and melancholy. The city took some of these places and redid them making them places that people could go to learn and experience Fado.The screen prints on the walls as well as some very artistic and much sought after graffiti is the result of local artists some Portugese and some ex pats from France and Great Britain--these ladies have become an integral, valued and much loved part of the community because they emerged themselves in the neighborhood.As you walk these streets there are small shops, and above the homes on the second floor are doors with flower pots wrapped in cloths, there are wooden doors with no balconies which seem to open to maybe inner courtyards if what we peeked was correct, Colorful wash draped some of the building walls and there were the usual colorwashes of pastel colors on the homes.The ex pat created a small area for children and even draped quilt sleeves on some of the trees, sort of colorful turtle necks--this is a living and working neighborhood punctuated with shops for light libations and colorful art. This is a place to come to and stroll and to find out finally, about the local people--it is a very personal and private area, with people tending to each other and their neighbors and making a place so in love and loyal that they do much to keep their elderly home so that they do not have to leave their homes to go to nursing facilities.it is beautiful, pretty quiet and very picturesque and tucked into various places are food shops and restaurants many, with an ethnic twist.This is the type of place that provides a counterpoint to all the obvious tourists places--this place is not for show and the people as well as the buildings are amazingly real and beautiful--I think, at least for us, this was a MUST and it helped to put some of what we saw or heard in context and certainly, it made our love of Fado even more intense."

I enjoyed the charm in the decay and even the grafiti in this historic area. In the day it's great for photos and finding a place to have a drink later at night because in the evening it's not ideal for wandering around. Perhaps due to tiny tavernas the Portugues people spill on to the Streets with their drinks giving a carnival feel every night. That said, as a New Yorker I was on guard while walking around at night. With so much narrow crowded Streets I kept my wallet in my front pocket, left vital IDs, creditcards at the hotel and brought only enough cash for the night. I would keep on the main Streets and not wander off on to narrow alley or stairways. Many drugdealers gets too close for my comfort. But after that...just relax and enjoy because it is really a unique area."

Bairro Alto is situated on one of those hills and provides a compact microcosm of the life of the city. Narrow cobbled streets straggle up and across the steep hill, many are served by the traditional trams (try to avoid the hideous tourist trams blaring out loud music!) and the steeper Escalador funiculars. Get a day pass for the city transport and Lisbon is easy to get around.There are great little bars and restaurants in every backstreet and we found the best pastelleria in the area of Rossio, where you can watch the traditional custard pastries being hand made, and can eat them warm straight from the oven.Lisbon is a great city to walk through but sadly there are pickpockets both in the street and metro. Our backpack was nimbly opened by a girl of about 15 but luckily returned the stolen purse when confronted then ran off.We stayed at Casa de Santos B&B near the market which was a great find."

We ate in one listening to a girl accompanied by 2 men, one with a guitar, the other with a viola. Although the singing was rather melancholy, it certainly was a great experience."

We had to get the metro from Marques Du Pombal but when we arrived I was quite amazed by all the little bars in quaint side streets and just how happening the area was. We visited a couple of bars and I was pleased (but also pleasantly amazed) I could also get something to eat there. I was very glad to get something there that made me feel right at home in the simple pleasures of a cheese and ham toastie then after I had some energy food I was ready to let my hair down. I enjoyed some local speciality drinks in the form of a margarita, caperina and also a couple of caiporoshes....after that I certainly let my hair down. Great atmosphere and the locals very friendly with one assisting me in some alternative salsa dancing. Fun and very lively.....loved it!"

The area is a grid of cobbled, semi-pedestrianized streets similar to the Old Compton Street area of Soho in London but absolutely packed in the evenings with patrons going in and out of bars or buying drinks from the cheap corner bars and standing outside. Both gay and gay-friendly, as well as straight and straight-friendly bars abound in this largely accepting neighborhood of this small but cosmopolitan city."

If I were to live in Lisbon and wanted to experience \"Lisbon-life\", this is where I would live. There are many locals, young and old, living in the area and it is very safe. There are always people around, day or night. The streets are like a maze but that's a lot of the fun! There are a lot of wonderful restaurants to try but you definitely want to do some research as many seem to have short lives. There are also many tiny, cramped convenience stores where you can grab basic groceries, beer and wine. One of the downsides to the area is that every morning the streets are filled with bottles and cups from the previous night's drinking. The smell of urine can be strong, too, as public urination seems quite common. The sidewalks are very narrow (12-18\" wide) and drivers expect that you will get out of the way for them; they don't slow for pedestrians!Our hotel was located in BA and we will definitely stay in the area when we return. It's where the action is."

Don't let the \"stay safe\" section of certain websites or some of the worst reviews here put you off, as long as you ignore the hashish men, keep your wits about you and take care of your belongings (as you should do anywhere anyway), Bairro Alto is pretty safe and brilliant fun.I haven't seen it during the day, but it is a great nightspot. You can eat in many restaurants of all kinds and all prices, great food to be had. You can pub crawl through the multitude of bars, finding some gems with massive beers for under \u20ac2 (get a normal size beer for about \u20ac1). You can find many bars with life music and some great talent.Roam the narrow alleyways and explore as much of the Bairro as you can, you'll not regret it!"

The best food we had on our entire 2 week trip was at Faz Frio Rua Dom Pedro V 96. It was not well identified on the front of the bldg. but it is on the right as you're heading right past the overlook. You will see the 96 on the bldg. We had their amazing seafood paella. We had to wait for it to be prepared as you do with paella anywhere, but it was well worth the wait. While in Lisbon, we had been saying no to the bread and butter but because of the long wait, we decided to keep it and eat it with our wine. A great decision because it was so good. This is a very small restaurant and although there were only two people when we arrived, it was packed when we left. We talked to locals celebrating their anniversary and they had been many times (a good recommendation). We also talked to the owner (he has owned it for over 20 years) and knew we were at the right spot. Great!"

As with much of Lisbon, this neighborhood has lots to see and explore other than the main touristy sights, and we underestimated the time required to really take it in. Honestly I wish we'd allowed for more time in Lisbon in general, as the city offers way more than some guidebooks lead you to believe. I liked wandering around, seeing the churches, poking in the cool shops (tile shops, used bookstores, etc.), and when walking down the Rua da Misericordia, reading the info and looking at photographs of the Carnation Revolution in 1974 that led to the end of Salazar's Portugal. Do yourself a favor and spend an afternoon poking around here, though I'd suggest starting at the top and working your way down - the streets are steep!!* If you like my review, I appreciate you clicking the 'helpful' button; those of us who take the time to write reviews live for those and it motivates us to do more :) *"

The buildings look old and run down, graffitti on the walls, fly posting on the shutters and a selection of last nights garbage on the side of the street. Go there after 10pm at night and it is an entirely different vibe! The whole place comes to life, the graffitti covered front doors are thrown open, revealing bar after bar after bar. The dingy looking shop fronts turn out to be inviting looking restaurants with tables outside and music is coming at you from all angles. Everyone is having a good time in what appears to be Lisbon's daily street party. The bars though numerous, are little more than single rooms a few feet wide, so the party happens on the street. Grab yourself a mohito in a big plastic cup and wander about until you hear some tunes you like. There really is something for everyone in this area, whatever food or music you like. Its a great atmosphere. Bars wind up around 2am."

The Bairro, or neighbourhood, as it is popularly known amongst Lisbon teenagers, is the place for hanging around after 11 at night for drinking beer and shots and just talk in the middle of the street. The bairro has some very good restaurants, however, try to get in and out before 11. Tourists who stand out are a good target for young pick pockets so beware. I would pass it up, although interesting, it is not worth the trouble as there are other excelent examples of old town Lisbon, such as Alfama, Gra\u00e7a or Mouraria, a pluricultural tical bairro."

I was in Room 310 (which I think was classified as a Deluxe Room). It was quite nice and roomy, though the bathroom was very cramped and only had a tub shower, which I do not really like. A friend was in a Suite (306), which was very nice indeed if you can afford it. I like everything about the hotel -- the staff was helpful and friendly, the breakfast was fine, and the location could not be better. The rooftop bar is a real highlight with an amazing viewed toward the river -- but be warned that at peak times it can get very busy and a table may be hard to come by and the service can be a bit slow as the staff get deluged with drink orders. It is difficult to imagine that there are many better options in Lisbon. I will be back."

Loved going out at 11pm every evening and stopping for tapas at 2am you can always find somewhere to eat and drink at all hours, favourite restaurant/bar The Decadente in Rua de Sao Pedro de Alcantara turned up at 12am and was seated outside, food was fantastic and the best cocktail 'Mr Smith'.

If not for the experience itself. But Bairro Alto is so much more than just a neighborhood. It's good food, great bars, great music, huge amounts of people to mingle with and the essence of what Lisbon's nightlife has been for the past few decades.You have design hotels. Old fashioned hotels and hostels. High end and gourmet restaurants. Fast food joints. Small bars with a balcony only that nearly just serve people standing in the street. Bars with live music. DJs. Fashion. Haut Couture. Street fashion. Arts. Crafts. Culture. Design. You name it, it's there. And most are open until late, usually 2am.Of course if you want the goods, you have to suffer. The traffic is chaotic starting from late afternoon. Parking is almost impossible even with several indoor parking lots. Best choice is to go by public transportation. And afterwards you can just walk your booze off and go down to Rossio and grab a late night Mac."

We arrived at our apartment, Akisol Bairro Apartments, and the oven wasn't working, the apartment was 4 flights up on the most steep stairs I have ever seen, and the street was dangerous and ghetto-like. Do not go here if you don't enjoy walking for hours. Pick pockets are everywhere, and they dress up like tourists with a camera around their neck and a tourist map, and will come up behind you in broad day light and steal anything and everything they can. On the second daywe requated for our oven to be fixed but we were told later (later never came) so we went to the main part of town and we got more of a feel for the city, and seemed to enjoy it that bit more, apart from having to watch your bag the entire time. Drug dealers are on every corner begging you to buy from them, these can also be distractions for pick pockets, you will never feel safe. On the final night the oven was fixed but worse was to come. Not at a late time my boyfriend walked to the shop which was >5 minutes away and came back over two hours later with a cut on his head, a sprained elbow and wrist...he had been mugged by some of the locals. He was dragged down a side street, after being tripped up and threatened, and after the ordeal he was sent in an opposite direction by the muggers, and was lost. They took his wallet which had no money in it as he was going to an ATM first to get us both out money for the airport, so both of our bank cards were gone also. The only thing he had was the key to the apartment and his phone with no battery life, and after finding some police men who only offered him a lift to the centre of the town, and taxi drivers who kept driving. When he eventually found someone who would help him, they took the phone number off the back of the key and rang our landlord and he finally came back to the apartment. The landlord was not happy abotu the phonecall, and gave out to my boyfriend for \"being drunk and lost\", when this was not the case, and ignored the cut on his head and limp arm by saying he was \"heavily drunk and only lost his wallet\". Do not go to these apartments, and be sure you want to risk visiting this town, maybe a day trip to the city would be best."

Pop into the local bakeries and try pasteis de nata, a creamy, sweet egg tart that crumbles in your mouth. There are also plenty of open public spaces like Praca Luis de Camoes where you can enjoy the European architecture and people watch as you take a break from all the walking.

This place is a bit quiet during the day, enough tourists in and out, but at night, past 11pm, the place turns into a zoo.People come out in crowds, and every door/window all of a sudden becomes a bar.The streets are packed and people are allowed to wander up and around the area with their plastic cups of whatever they are drinking. A tip would be just to bring your own as it'll be cheaper and the mini markets are open late to sell beer for much less.I do not suggest you booking accommodations in this area unless you do want to go out and party from Thurs-Sat nights.The noise is loud and it keeps being loud til about 3/4am.It's great tho as it's got a great vibe and if you are looking for a party, then Bairro Alto at night is for you. Not sure what it is like Sun-Wed night tho... so it may be a bit dead then."

The streets are full of small bars and restaurants, drinks are slightly cheaper than at other parts of Lisbon. A lot of the bars play live music and to a very high quality.

Friends had recommended for us to stay in Bairro Alto and we were glad that we did once we arrived! The narrow streets are sprinkled with bars and restaurants in the entire neighborhood. It is mostly pedestrians flooding the streets with Sagres or caipirinhas in hand, having a grand time enjoying live music, food, sidewalk/street cafes, and the company of friends. The beautiful thing about Bairro Alto is how centrally located it is - a short walk from the Tejo and clubs on the river, next door to the Miradoura, steps from the Chiado district, and a short walk away from Cais do Sodre train station, which will transport you to your next excursion outside of the main city area. If you go to Portugal, definitely visit Bairro Alto!"

We did not get the impression that it is an area where portuguese people socialize. It is indeed a very touristic place for eating and drinking. There are lots, but lots of restaurants and bars and when reading reviews a lot of people comment on the restaurants catering for tourists. Well, it is the touristic spot at night so every door in there is waiting for you, non-lisbon residents, to enter. It is a place overrated by guidebooks, very deceiving for what it offers. Try to walk the streets during the day and enjoy the architecture of every different house, every door-way, every different window, residents in their windows looking at life passing-by. I recommend it more day time than night, depending on what you look for. We also found some really, but really expensive Fado restaurants in this area."

            "review": "A night to remember. Bairro Alto is one of the many historical neighbourhoods of Lisbon. Started as a mid-upper class residential area after the 1755 hearthquake, it was the centre of the city's cultural life, together with the neighbouring Chiado area.As years passed and with the development of other more modern parts of Lisbon, Bairro Alto saw most of its youth move out. By the 1960's and 1970's, unlike Chiado, Bairro Alto had become increasingly more and more degraded and seedy and with an old and poor population. The neighbourhood was known for prostitution, basic and seedy taverns, cheap and unimpressive restaurants and for being home to some of the country's most representative newspapers, some streets even being named after them, like Di\u00e1rio de Noticias or O S\u00e9culo.Things changed dramatically in the 1980's, when Bairro Alto was rediscovered by the city's students and by a population with an increasing acqusitive power and eager for enjoying life. In the following years, surviving the downfall of Chiado after the 1988 great fire, the seedy taverns gave way to trendy bars and shops, the basic restaurants stepped up a few notches and were joined by more sophisticated options, prostitutes were replaced by a hip young crowd who came to the Bairro not only to have fun but to live there.Nowadays, Chiado has become one of Lisbon's and Europe's chic areas and Bairro Alto lives on as THE place for nightlife, despite the increasing competition from nearby Bica, Principe Real or from Alfama and the Docks. It is loud, dirty, the streets are packed with people drinking, laughing, talking, shouting, smoking (sometimes smoking barely legal stuff), there may be the odd fist fight, many people may find it difficult to like, but you have to forget all that, let yourself go and just enjoy it.It's difficult to set an itinerary to follow, but here are some tips:- Bairro Alto is fairly quiet during the day, but it's the opposite at night. I suggest you experience it during the day and then at night. The difference will blow your mind;- The crowdest nights are Friday and Saturday. Thursday is becoming increasingly popular, but Friday and Saturday Spring and Summer nights are your best options;- Do it the Portuguese way: arrive late. Before midnight is just too early. The routine is to meet the friends at Cam\u00f5es square, have dinner around 10 pm or later, end your dinner around midnight and hit the streets going bar hopping until it's time to go to a disco (never before 2 am). Discos usually close at 6 am, some at 7 or 8, and then there are the after parties to keep the party animals going.- Barroca, Atalaia and Di\u00e1rio de Noticias are the most packed streets and also where the most popular bars are. Try P\u00e1ginas Tantas (good cocktails and hot toasts), Favela Chic, Tert\u00falia, Tasca do Chico (live, popular, unpretentious Fado music on some nights) at Di\u00e1rio de Noticias; try the Corner Club, the 41 or the Maria Caxuxa at Barroca Street; check the Portas Largas and Arroz Doce at Atalaia Street. The junction of Barroca Street and Travessa da Espera is usually packed and it's sometimes difficult to move; it's also a popular gay spot as there are a few gay bars around;Another great place for a drink is the Bar at Bairro Alto Hotel, on Cam\u00f5es Square. Get the Purple Mood cocktail!;Try also Lost in Translation (ethnic shop, with a bar/restaurant and amazing views over Lisbon) and Pavilh\u00e3o Chin\u00eas (Chinese Pavillion, extensive cocktails and other drinks menu, eclectic, wacky decoration, try to figure out how they dust the whole place; must see) at D.Pedro V street, bordering Bairro Alto-There are plenty of dinner (or lunch) options for everyone at Bairro Alto. Reservations are highly recommended, especially on peak nights. Here are a few suggestions:A Caba\u00e7a, Stasha, Cantinho das G\u00e1veas, Sinal Vermelho at G\u00e1veas street. The last two are extremely popular and together with the first serve traditional basic Portuguese food. The other offers modern Portuguese food. Remember to ask for 'Bife na pedra' (steak on hot stone) at Caba\u00e7a, your clothes will stink afterwards but it's worth it;A Baiuca at Barroca Street, practically an institution in Lisbon. Offers traditional Portuguese food, the 'Bacalhau com Natas' (cod with cream) is a must. Also at Barroca you have Sudoeste, your best option to grab a tasty snack after kitchens close at the mainstream restaurants;Bota Alta at Atalaia Street, again traditional Portuguese, great food but a bit pricier option;Novo Bonsai, at Rosa street, for excellent Japanese food;100 Maneiras at Travessa do Teixeira, one of the best restaurants in Lisbon and in Portugal, modern food, inspired by Portuguese flavours, a touch of molecular gastronomy here and there, an experience that will blow your mind. Reservations mandatory!;The Decadente @ The Independente Hostel on S. Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara street, trendy place, great atmosphere, good value for money portuguese food with a modern twist. Nice brunch on Sundays too (an option to recover from a long night out)- It is likely you are approached by people offering you drugs. My advice is don't buy it even if you're interested. Just ignore them, they are not insistent. - Ladies leave your high heel shoes at the hotel, or else the Bairro's cobbled streets will give you a hard time (or a twisted ankle). Comfortable shoes are in order. Portuguese are very laid back and informal so you won't need to dress up for dinner.- Smoking is not allowed at restaurants and in most bars.- Don't be shy, talk to strangers. Portuguese are welcoming and most people speak at least one foreign language, particularly English. If they don't, they will make an effort to communicate.- There aren't any discos at Bairro Alto. This is the place where you come for dinner and drinks before moving on to the Docks, Alc\u00e2ntara, 24th of July avenue and Santa Apol\u00f3nia for dancing. You can also try the nearby Pr\u00edncipe Real area for gay discos.A day at the Bairro Alto is a trip to old, historical, popular Lisbon. A night at Bairro Alto is a roller coaster trip through young, wild, trendy, wacky Lisbon. Enjoy!"

We got all the drinks we could handle for around 8-12 euros each and bar-hopped the whole night. Take a clutch purse or something you can keep your hand on at all times just to be safe and I think it best to go with guys, but you would be OK with just girls if you kept your eyes out and were safe. It is easy to get to from the Chiado/Restauradores area but we climbed a TON of stairs to get up there. Tons of large mojitos/strawberry mojitos/pina coladas for only 5 euros and several places with 1 euro shots (bring a chaser?) and after the bars close down around 3 there is a street slightly below bairro alto with lots of after-hour clubs that stay open the rest of the morning. You really won't find anything else like this but the crowds are huge, the streets noisy, and the drinks are not absolutely amazing if you want them to be cheap, but there are definite hidden gems like salsa clubs and jazz restaurants among the cheaper, less classy bars."

And evening is best. The cobbled narrow streets are a nightmare to drive if you get off the main roads and your GPS will send you down impossible streets (I had a Fiat 500 5 speed w/ the side mirrors pulled in and it was still tight) so take the funicular. By the way, it uses the same pass or 10 ride card that the rest of the system uses, and if you change from metro or bus to get on the tram or anything else within 1:15 min.s, it is just one trip off the card. So don't buy a special round trip ticket (about 7E for 2). After you view the city from the park and snap a few, just leave. Food is overpriced and no better than anywhere else. Unless you are a kid and have to be with all the other imbeciles your age (the park filled up with kids toward dark and had a heavy metal band playing way too loud for anyone over 40 to retain equilibrium within a block of the place) just enjoy the view and go back within your 1:15 and it will be almost free! It is a pretty shabby place. The national natural history museum is really pitiful and not worth the price, but same price ticket (1 E more)you into the garden next door. It is great. Just go to the park if you must find one other thing to do up there. From the tram up, follow the street up and around the curve to the left about 4 blocks to the Botanical Garden. I know others will have a different view, but this is a 60's couple from America who no longer thing shabby and run down is \"neat\". Alfama was not much to me either, except for the views from the Mirador. Hey, finding a clean free bathroom is an exciting thing at my age, so take it for what it's worth and consider the source."

This is very different to other European countries as all the bars were free to get into and none of them had doors! It was literally like a mini carnival without the costumes. It gets extremely packed here on weekends so go earlier to get a good look of what there is to offer."

It\u2019s a neighborhood with low buildings and narrow streets where, at night, some are dedicated only to pedestrians. Offers many restaurants, many with few tables, and bars, many with live music. But are the streets that from midnight fill with people, which enliven the area that also has near many shops and hotels. People walk just like in groups, parking is possible mostly at garages, better went by public transport."

I heard they aren`t nasty as the ones in Morocco or Egypt, but put your poker face on if you don`t want to enter that particular restaurant. Looking at them, smiling, talking to them, answering their questions (where are you from? _____ oh, yes I know (smth from your country)____), looking confused and lost, turns them on and you`ll be eating in their restaurant in no time.

If you are at all familiar with college-area nightlife - cheap drinks, cheap karaoke, weirdos, packs of young 20somethings - you will recognize it here. I went to a karaoke bar, got hammered, met some dude who was a heavy metal fan, walked around, then walked home to my hotel at 2:30 am.Actually, if you're an older adult or with a partner, you can go here and have dinner in one of the many, many restaurants here around 10 or 11, then head home. Still a good night out. A word on safety - I was alone and when I turned the corner to see an empty street, I skipped it. Just a precaution. There are so many people around here that a brisk walk and a firm shake of the head will solve 99% of problems. Not that I had any."

We got a seat and had a few cocktails, enjoyed the music. As the night wore on the bars got busier and people were flooding out onto the streets. The music was very good but the bars were very packed. People were squeezing past each other to get to the bar, spilling drinks and bumping off each other. That was fine. Not very enjoyable but to be expected on a busy night. What I didn't like was when the bars stopped serving there was a massive swell of very drunken people out into the narrow street. I hadn't drank much as I wasn't feeling well and I felt very vulnerable in this situation. Some people were being quite aggressive to strangers standing next to them. When I heard glass being thrown I insisted to my husband that we go home. He was bit more drunk and didn't see the danger. I personally didn't think it was the best night."

At the end of the fifteenth century it was named Vila Nova de Andrade and it consists of the \u201cfrequesias\u201d of the Incarnation and Santa Catarina. The streets are narrow and very steep. The houses in the area are very old. The local trade is small. Its main attractions are restaurants and bars resulting in a wonderful place for enjoying the nightlife. The views from the belvedere are spectacular, including the beautiful Tejo river. Climb in the trolley. Mingle with the locals who are friendly, welcoming and cheerful. It will be a pleasant experience. However, if you are a disabled person you will have to take a taxi or a van. The trolley has no entry for the wheelchair. The steps of the Monorail\u2019s entrance are too narrow. There are no restaurants or bars suitable for the disabled. A cool thing to do is sit on the sidewalk tables of bars that extend beyond the inside. You will be able to use the wheelchair in the region as long as you have someone to help you on the more difficult spots. There are unexpected holes and the streets narrow with no warnings. There are no appropriate recesses to climb up and down the sidewalks. Walking on crutches will present the same difficulties. Despite all that, the beauty of the view, the contact with the local and the food and fun in the bars and restaurants are a good reward for all the effort. Just sit and relax with an incredible view,"

But walk a, few blocks, and you still find empty decaying buildings, cheap restaurants, hostels, edgy bars, offering a variety of music and entertainment venues and those that follow that scene. The fashionable area is alive during the day, and early evening, while the seedier area, is in full bloom late nights and early mornings. Not sure, how long the two will live side by side.

We declined the cheese and bread offered as we were not very hungry, there is always a charge for this. I tried the pork wrapped in bacon with potatoes and veg, so lovely. Great flavour. My friends had the brill and the salted cod both good. The salted cod can be an acquired taste which my friend wanted to try but did not love. Over all the meal was nice. Great Value at \u20ac8.50 for mains (late afternoon) prices may vary later in the evening for dinner). Wine and beer was good and well priced. We shared the chocolate cake and this was lovely.

We are both in our mid-fifties and were a little concerned that we'd feel totally out of place. Yes, the Bairro Alto attracts a lot of younger people who stay out until the early hours, but it also welcomes \"oldies\" such as us. If you can find a table and chairs outside all the better, but most people stand, lean and prop themselves up against the walls. Everyone chats to each other and the whole area had a buzz about it.Probably bececause of our age we were never approached or offered drugs and did not see any evidence of this going on. The whole area felt completely safe and everyone was good-natured and friendly.We had three wonderful dinners - one in a traditional restaurant, and the other two in an Indian restaurant - all were reasonably priced."

Sardines and cod obvious specialities. Unfortunatly also a lot of tatty drinking dens (avoid). Apart from eating and drinking , the big attraction here is the fado. There are a number of largish establishments offering twice nightly fado shows, but these are often jammed with tourists off coach tours and are perhaps best avoided. Try one of the smaller, more modest places for a different experience. The \"Caldo Verde\" is one that springs to mind. Just ask around and someone will point the way. A meal with drinks there costs about 30 euros. The show is free but the fadistas sort of expect you to buy their CDs, which they will gladly sign (15 euros). And please remember, as a mark of respect, to avoid loud conversations while they are singing these wonderful songs."

During the day it was very quiet in part especially around the area where 100 Maneiras Restaurant was based. Taxi drivers didn't know where this was, we popped into the nearby Museum and the portugese gentleman used googlemaps to tell us where the street was! We did find it but not eat here (no veggie options) We walked back to Avenida da Liberdade using the hill where the furnicular is based. The Gloria funicular connects Lisbon's downtown with the Bairro Alto. This place has lots of bars and restaurants and was very busy in the evening. We eat here one evening at the Sukhothai Restaurant on Rua da Atailia and the streets around the restaurant were heaving with people sitting/standing outside smoking and drinking. The streets are very narrow and claustraphobic and there was little breeze here."

Basicly, Bairro Alto are (/is) a couple of streets, with a lot of bars. Most people buy their cheep drinks (i.e 3-4\u20ac for a Mojito, 1\u20ac for a shot, 1,2\u20ac for a beer) inside the bars, but drink them outside. Both streets and bars get very crowdy in the weekends, but it's better to go on friday or saturday. Other days can be so quiet that its actually boring. You can't say you really saw the charm of Bairro Alto if you went on an other day. It's like attending a church on wednesday evening instood of sunday morning. If you come from down town by foot you have to climb up A LOT of stairs. Not recommended if you aren't in good/normal shape. A must see for all young people. I think that older people would annoy themself on the extremely loud music, crowdy drunk people and a lot of smoke. But isn't every bar? :)"

The local independent businesses are enterprising & thriving, and it is such a joy to discover all those brilliant unusual designs which you won't find anywhere else.... not to be missed. The you can catch the Alfama bound 28 tram on Calcada do Combro , getting on before the crowds of tourists join at Chiado or Baixa... you might even get a seat!

As a fellow post I read stated so well-you know you are in a good Portuguese restaurant when the menu is not in english. Restaurant was an authentic italian one called Casanostra. we were recommended to try an antipasto octopus dish which was a 9/10! I had the duck with a type of cheese that made the flavour of the dish come to life and dance in my palette. My wife had a fish dish w shrimp that was equally as good. We finished the night with a trip to the haagen dasz (located right outside the Biaxa metro station) and wolfed down 5 scoops of ice cream between us. Omg soo good!"

The whole are is very dynamic since throughout the day shops and general commerce is open with neighbours speaking to each other and then as the night turns up, restaurants start to get their crowd and then bars open until 3am.Things are also dynamic since bars tend to close and then reopen somewhere else. Also, the crowds change location every now and then as one spot becomes more \"in\" than another. It is a walk-only location. Do not attempt to drive here since it is closed to cars apart from taxis and local traffic.Accessible from any direction, it's main entry point is Largo de Cam\u00f5es, reachable by tram, bus, underground and taxi.

There are a lot of great little restaurants and bars in this area, and on weekend nights things really get going around 11pm-ish. My first night there was a Friday, and I woke at 2:30am to a full street party below the apartment window! If you're a sound-sleeper, it probably won't affect you. And if you're looking for an area to party, you'll love it. Otherwise, you may want to choose a quieter area of town."

Being of an age where finding an ad hoc party is no longer an aim in life, I cannot comment on the partying qualites of this area, but it is certainly worth a visit or two. It is most easily reached by riding the Elevador da Gloria which starts/ends just off the bottom/southern end of Avenida da Liberdade. If you've any sense you'll already have purchased a Lisbon Card and so ride for free. At the top turn right and enjoy the views from the small park across towards the Castelo S.Jorge. If you turn left you have a good downhill route to the Chiado. Barrio Alto is a pleasant area to walk around and explore with various restaurants although we didn't try any of them."

The atmosphere of the cobbled streets and old buildings was unforgettable and, although quiet and deserted by day, was transformed into a different place by night full of excellent restaurants and bars.Despite what other correspondents have said, we never felt threatened nor felt anxious in the area and recommend a visit when in Lisbon."

LADIES.... wear comfortable shoes as there are alot of steep streets and as you will already know they are cobbled."

Live music in some palces, DJs in others. You will be offered drugs - coke, weed, hash. Just say no thanks if you aren't interested.A must visit if you are between 18 and 40 yrs - probably not so much for older folks."

We walked to one as it was not very far into the Bairro Alto area, but took a cab to and from the other which was in the heart of this district. Aside from the walking challenges (very steep with sidewalks that sometimes disappear) the whole vibe at night is a bit sketchy. Many nightclubs and Fado music places in this area which seemed like they might be fun, but after dark it is a bit creepy."

The best time to visit is night time when the streets filled with locals, the only day we did not see a ton of people there was on Sundays. It has tiny bars where you grab your drink and go to the street to socialize. I has something for every taste, although mostly lovely holes in the wall, it also has some more upscale bars as well as wine bars. We also ate at a lovely restaurant, delicious traditional Portuguese food and listen to some wonderful Fado. It is a relaxed place so most people are wearing jeans and flats with a cute top, and men wear jeans and t-shirts, some shirts here and there but definitely informal.We felt safe at ALL times, not only in Bairro Alto but in Lisbon in general and we were out until 3-4 AM every night."

There are also a lot of bars there. It is worth going there during the night, even during the week, as there is a wonderfull atmosphere. All the bars are open, and people are standing outside them drinkling, chatting and dancing. Everyone is very friendly."

This is really a night spot, and in my opinion, a tourist trap"

Definetly is \"the Place\" to go out. Whether for dinner in one of the typical and inexpensive Tascas (Adega Dantas - great food) or the fancy Pap'Acorda. In any case the night starts late (dinner never before 21h and going out never before 23:30). Then diversity is the right word, whether you go to a Fado house or to grab a beer and stay at the street, a lot of fun is assured."

Only after meeting other tourists on a night out did we actually realise how much more we are charged compared to the locals, don't be afraid to haggle on the price of drinks as they strangely come down depending on how much Portuguese you can speak and your willingness to argue, also don't under any circumstances eat in Bairro Alto as this is a MISTAKE! The place is filthy, very overpriced, stinks to high heaven and bloody dangerous as hygiene simply isn't a concept that's understood."

At the top, turn left & squeeze down the little sidewalk for a couple blocks. Then to your right you'll find the little streets of Barrio Alto. With lots of restaurants, shops & bars, you're sure to find some place you'll like. We enjoyed having a drink outside at a restaurant on a small side alley with a guy that played some nice Brazilian music on his guitar."

            "review": "My favorite place in the world!. The Bairro Alto comes alive as the sun sets in Lisbon. The many wonderful, small and intimate restaurants begin to open around 8:00 p.m. Many of the restaurants can only seat 10 or 12 couples, and some, even less. The food is spectacular. Having been to many of the restaurants, none of them have been a disappointment. There are many Fado clubs there that are very commercial. We were fortunate enough to find one that is strictly for locals who get up and take turns at the microphone. There is nothing like a cover charge, and seating is first come, first serve. Drink prices are beyond cheap. There are perhaps 8 tables similar to a picnic table, only smaller. In order to get a decent seat, arrive no later than 7:00 p.m. and don't leave your seat! We were very fortunate to meet someone who lives in Lisbon, and is a regular at the club. He was kind enough to hold our seats for us while we had dinner. Actually, he did that for us on our many trips to Lisbon. The most phenomenal singers in the world. Even though neither my husband nor I speak Portuguese, we were brought to tears many times at the sheer emotion that surfaces when one of those very gifted people stand up to sing. They are not professionals, they range in age from 12 to 90, all have \"day jobs\" and share the emotion of the history of their country and the difficult and sad times when sailors left their families and loved ones to find a means of support for their families. Songs that are passed down from generation to generation and sung with all the feelings that are deep in the souls of the Portuguese. These people were poverty-poor, and losing the breadwinner in the home as well as the strong and undying loves of their lives., they developed this marvelous way of expressing their feelings through song. Amalia Rodriguez is a legend among Fado singers and although she has passed on, she is revered in Portugal. I'm hesitant to give the name of the club, because i would hate for it to become too commercial. On the other hand, I want everyone to experience an evening at Tasco do Chico. They don't start singing until at least 11:00 p.m. and usually end somewhere around 4:00 a.m. so be prepared for a late night experience that you will never forget."

Bairro Alto was our cool shopping spot during the day with numerous, tiny fashion forward boutiques that are dotted along the narrow streets. By night, my friend and I circled the same areas that had now turned into crowded, fun, and lively bars that were bursting with people hanging out and people watching. I recommend this area and will go back soon."
