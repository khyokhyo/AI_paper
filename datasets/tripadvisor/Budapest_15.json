But for an American, the 1956 Revolution information against the Soviet Union, and the atomic bomb information later, was captivating. The courage and determination of first, doctors and nurses, and later wounded soldiers, medical personnel, with 600 patients in a place meant for 40--beyond belief. Told from those who were on the other side of the \"Iron Curtain.\" The guides were outstanding, available in English. Highly recommend."

Budapest is a beautiful place but it's good to remember it's extremely difficult history during the world wars and cold war. This is a moving exhibition, very well done. It's fascinating that a functioning hospital could be built here, and we had to admire the doctors and nurses who understood how critical they were, and lived full time inside the facility to serve the wounded."

This was nicely organised and we had a well-spoken guide who negotiated a large group of us in tandem with another group and did this very well. It's a very interesting place with lots of WW1 & 2 plus Cold War history. Starts with a subtitled film (note to self: sit in back row or against wall so can stand to see subtitles).

Although it is difficult to locate (considering you have to find an elevator near to the Funicular and then walk up the road to find it), it is still worth locating this hidden gem. There are tours offered in various languages. Our tour guide was very enthusiastic about informing tourists about the role that the hospital played, not only in the war, but also how it has shaped treatment now. The Hospital also shows how parts of the Buda Castle area still have parts of the hospital built into the architecture, such as the vents in the street. Learn about the machine that played a part in Evita and the (largely unmentioned) story of how Hungarian soldiers saved an American soldier's life."

There was 4 of us with 2 on their early 20s and 2 in our late 40s and we enjoyed it equally. I would not recommend it to very young children but anyone with teenagers I am sure they would like it. The tours about an hour and Milan our tour guide was fabulous. He makes it interesting,thought provoking and he was clearly passionate about his job. You tour round the tunnels of what was the hospital and it's brought to life with the equipment and lifelike waxworks and the history behind it and Hungary during and after the war is emotional but Interesting. Don't do this tour if you are claustrophobic as the whole tour is underground in the tunnels.The only minus is they show you a film for 10 minutes before the tour and the subtitles in English are too low in the screen to read unless you are in the front row so you don't know what the film is about Just put the subtitles at the top of the screen and the whole experience would have been an excellent but apart from that it is certainly worth doing. It's in the beautiful castle district which if you don't want to pay the price to get up there by the funicular or walk the rather steep steps then the number 16 bus goes and the stop is just opposite the funicular"

The guide was very informed and stressed the conditions during both conflicts, citing people who had worked there that he was able to talk with when they came back to see the place after it was opened to the public."

            "review": "interesting museum of WWII hospital and Soviet era nuclear bunker. A friend recommended this museum, and since our daughter is a physician, we thought it would be interesting for all of us to see under what conditions doctors worked during WWII. Originally built to take in 60 patients, the hospital often had over 200, so that the beds were pushed together, and patients placed virtually on top of each other. And although the hospital had running water, occasionally the water supply was cut when bombs destroyed the municipal supply. We could only imagine how rapidly sanitation deteriorated. After WWII, the hospital was converted to a civil defense shelter in case of nuclear attack, with washing stations and special ventilation. The radiation symbols and gas masks were grim reminders of the nuclear threat during the 1950's and 1960's. On the way out of the bunker, there is a long hallway with drawings by survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs. Our guide spoke very good English, and as a result of the popularity of this museum, there is an English tour every hour."

I would have given the hospital an 'excellent' except for the fact that the tour was very rushed and visitors have no time to stop and look or even read the signs on the walls. This is not only a fascinating piece of Budapest's history but, for anyone interested in the war time practise of medicine, these caves, transformed into a working hospital with operation theatres and wards, acted as a safe haven for soldiers and civilians, both Hungary's enemies and friends. However, the guides are trained to say politically correct things, acceptable to everyone, which will not cause offence to eventual losers of the war. For more accurate information, buy G\u00e0bor Tatai's 'Short History of the Hospital in the Rocks', on sale in the shop, which will give you a truer account of what actually happened inside and outside the hospital, not only during WWII but through the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.

The entrance and gift shop have been renovated/decorated and some displays updated, with more emphasis now on the post-Hiroshima/Cold War era, and further extensions ongoing. Admission is via guided tour only (in Hungarian, English or German: other languages on request), which takes about an hour, including an introductory film (in Hungarian with English subtitles, which could be improved). Our guide, Anna, spoke very good English, as did all the staff, and was very well briefed. There is much walking through tunnels, with some steps at one point. The environment - 20 metres underground - is not for claustrophobics and some displays may not suit young children. Photography is prohibited, as it makes groups difficult to manage (I can see the argument), but this does help focus visitors' attention on what is a fascinating insight into the events of World War 2 and the subsequent Communist era. If you want an idea of what the citizens of Budapest experienced during the war, this is a very good starting point."

The tour started with a visit the Hospital which was first used during the siege of Budapest in the 2nd World War then in the 1956 uprising and was ready to be used again if there was a nuclear attack during the Cold War. All the original equipment is still in place including medical instruments/equipment with wax figures representing patients/doctors/nurses etc. The tour continued into the communictions area and the extension created during the Cold War all the service equipment is still in place. The Guide was very informative and we were certainly pleased we took the tour which took about an hour"

I'm a nurse working in an operating theatre and my husband is very interested in communications and 'army type' stuff. Our guide spoke excellent English and we could hear him clearly, but it was very rushed. There was no time to look at the exhibits or posters etc. after he had finished speaking, he just moved on to the next room. This was a shame as there was so much to see. At one point we did get left behind, but there was at least two other tours going on and their guides could point us in the right direction.Perhaps a room or two with some of the exhibits on display where you can look at your leisure after your tour?I think it's worth a visit, but you do need more time. It feels a bit like going through a museum on a timer."

There were discounts at least for people under 26. The tour starts with a short back and white film about the history of the hospital during WWII and the Hungarian revolution in 1956. After that the tour guide takes you and the group around the tunnels, telling about each room, some of the equipment and people that used to work there. The wax figurines made the place feel alive, and some of the rooms were quite shoking when combined with the descriptions told by the guide. Some rooms that used to be full of hospital beads were transformed into small museums showing WWII and modern Hungarian army gear etc. I would have liked to see those rooms in their original use instead, but I guess the reason behind this was to avoid too much repetition with showing too many rooms with the same purpose and layout. There is also a nuclear bunker built on the side of the hospital, and the tour takes you through both. I usually don't like being forced to walk with a group and to listen to a guide, but in this case it was much more interesting to listen to the guide than it would have been just to read the same info. Very interesting tour, and I would definitely recommend this to any people interested in history of modern medicine, WWII era and the Cold War's nuclear threat."

To address some of the comments of other reviewers: the mannequins are not that bad at all, they provided scale and interest; the nuclear war discussion is a reasonable effort to address what was a primary threat to life on Earth and is still a lingering - though not discussed - issue; the guide had some good context to the helicopter and current battlefield MEDEVAC diorama; and a good explanation was given for why the raw cave network is not accessible. Our guide was very good and engaged. Another good feature of this site is its lengthy opening hours. The only thing holding me back from a higher rating was a sense, shared by some other reviewers, that the charge is a bit too high. I've toured huge Maginot Line Fortifications for less that the entry charge to this museum."

It's also designed to show you aspects of war and show how the casualties ended up down here. Some notes:- teachers get in free, just take some proof of ID and give them the name of the institute where you work. - they sell gas masks here and they are cheap (around \u00a36 each - 2000ft)- no photos or videos are allowed.

Our guide was knowledgeable and spoke English well. Because it was a tour for families, she incorporated activities such as a trivia competition, letting the kids dress up in hospital garb and put bandages on each other, letting them turn the air raid crank, etc. As other reviewers have noted, we were told not to take photos in the facility itself. However, we were allowed to take photos of the kids still dressed up in hospital garb, in the gift shop just inside the entrance.Altogether memorable and also well located in the Castle District not too far from other stuff worth seeing, such as the Fisherman's Bastion overlook."

The information was very cursory and by the end I was wondering why some things were included at all (why reassemble a helicopter within the bunker, have a modern-day combat triage scene or branch off quite a bit onto the nuclear bombs dropped on Japan?

Price is ok, around 7\u20ac and you have to do a tour, which is good but also a bummer because all the information in the museum is not readable in the time you \"rush through\" with your guide. For the introduction video, sit in the front, otherwise you can't read the subtitles:) Also I didn't know that you couldn't take pictures...All in all a good memory for myself and noone else I could share it with"

To experience a fully guided tour through its many labyrinths with its many restored displays of how it was a secret hospital during WWII, and a nuclear bunker during the 1956 uprising was truly amazing and well worth it."

There are no photos allowed so I'll have to just describe the experience. First there's a historical video to provide the context of what was going on in 1945 and 1958 when this hospital was used. Then we're offered coats since we're 8 meters deep in solid rock and it can be chilly without the body heat of patients and staff to warm it. They are 40s era coats; mine was a nurse's cape. I really didn't need it. All the equipment,surgical tools and furniture are original. They say the mannequins are wax but I saw them as eerily realistic. As we walked through the emergency treatment/triage area to the wards (populated with patients in the beds and nurses/doctors attending) it was possible to forget that it was just a tour. Our guide's English was excellent. His knowledge was broad, including the hospital and the subsequent Soviet use of the space as a nuclear bunker. It wasn't just a speech he's memorized and he asked for questions at each stop.We were silent as we left, reflecting how very lucky our country is to have never suffered an external attack on our city and homes."

Even the whole building is huge, it provided help only for a few patients. A guided tour needs about 45 minutes - and you can see how a hospital was operating during war or crisis.

The rooms have been stocked with life-size wax figurines, some of them pretty gruesome, but the whole package does give you a decent sense of what it might have been like as a patient in this hospital.Added bonus is the revisionist history on display: Budapest as a perpetual victim of invasion and siege, equating the shelling of the city during the Communist period (particularly during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution) with the shelling of the city at the end of the Second World War...and conveniently downplaying the fact that Hungary was an Axis power during the war. The hospital makes a big deal of saying that it was open as a public facility during both sieges (it was a secret military facility the rest of the time), furthering that symbolic equation. So all of that is an additional, if unintentional, piece of the attraction."

When we got there, English tours were happening every half hour, which was great, since we got there a quarter past.The tour kicks off with a quick movie that sets the mood. Our guide was good and energetic, and happy to answer the occasional question. After 8 minutes, we were off to roam through the underground.The tour progresses with several stops where the guide will tell you about what the particular nearby rooms were used for. Now filled with wax figures, you get an idea just how cramped this place was during it's tenure. There is one \"surprise\" later, which feels real out of place.A brief part of the tour honors Hungary's elite soldiers. All well and good, but a bit out of place for the place and theme.A second brief part of the tour detours into atomic/nuclear weapons, with a clear anti-nuclear stance and lots of artwork by Japanese children about Nagasaki/Hiroshima.The tour goes out to a point in the facility and then circles back to let you end in the lobby. There are certain areas which are off limits, and no way to roam around on your own. There isn't enough room. Several of the monitors appeared to be not working during our tour.The tour ended promptly at 60 minutes. While interesting, the non-Euro price is sort of steep. However, due to the space and it's role in history, this would definitely interest WWII, Soviet and general Budapest history buffs.Location is a short walk from Buda Castle. If done the right way, you'll see part of the cave system not used by the hospital."

It is quite chilli down there but you are offered coats. There are loads of weird looking models set up as it would of been in the war, all the medical equipment and supplies are authentic, check the expirary dates. The guides speak very good English and their knowledge is outstanding. It seems like a somber place to visit but do not be put off, it is a fantastic look at how Hungary managed to provide care to soldiers in safety and hidden from enemy bombs.Not suitable for young children and expensive for an hour visit (4000 huf ) but well worth the effort."

Besides, I wanted to have some relief from the boiling weather...The ticket is a bit expensive - HUF 4000 - (30% off with the Budapest card, which is on the other hand not a great deal, so only if you have it..) and the approach is more prone towards an experience for the whole family. Be advised, there are no small coats if your kids feel cold so bring a sweater if they are not fine with the underground temperature.The tour is mainly provided in English so don't worry about that (an initial video is screened with English subtitles). The first part of it regards the areas of the hospital and only the few remaining rooms are dedicated to the nuclear bunker.A room is dedicated to the effects of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs and hidden behind a panel to allow the view only to adults.Out guide proved to be extremely patient with the children asking any type of questions (some were very smart ones though!).It might not be the bunker you would expect but it's worth paying a visit, at least for the big smiles of the members of the staff, very friendly and motivated people."

My wife talked about wanting to see a hospital while we were on the Buda side of the river. I was not really inspired by the idea, but had no problem just checking it out. It was GREAT! This cavernous place has such a fascinating history that extends from the Second World War through the Cold War. The Soviets made this a nuclear disaster treatment facility and declared it top secret! Most fascinating was its use during WWII and the tragic and heroic true stories that happened there.You are taken on a thorough tour in language groups. Our young guide spoke excellent English and was extremely knowledgeable and conversant on the history of the hospital. If you are a medical person of any calling, you will be fascinated by this facility. All of the old/original medical implements/instruments are there on display. You can clearly see the horrors of war and the gallant efforts made by the staff under nearly impossible circumstances. I promise...you will not be disappointed!"

With the Fishermans Bastion on your right head down one of the side streets on the left and you may see a signpost, or just ask. There's a lift down to a road on which the museum is situated.The tours take place at certain times with a limited number allowed so check before you go ! You might be able to pre-purchase tickets. The tour begins with a film in a quite claustrophobic room (12mins) and you then proceed with your guide. Ours was a young lady who was very good and knew her stuff. The tour lasts about an hour and you see the rooms which housed the patients, the operating theatre, showers, kitchens etc. The end also takes in the \"engine room\" and you learn some interesting and quirky secrets.Special rates are offered for seniors,students etc but it isn't expensive anyway. There is a place to have a snack and drink if you have to wait for the next tour.Definately worth a visit."

Pictures in the rooms highlighted how things were back in the 40s & 50s etc.Conditions were hard, especially during the war.

The cool air (15\u00b0 C) in the bunker was also a welcome relief in the summer heat. They provide coats for those who may wish to use them.

Once the video is done (~10 minutes) the tour continues with a guide inside the hospital. It's quite cold in the caves but the museum provides coats if neccesary so you don't have to bring any special clothes for this visit. The tourgide we had was very friendly. His english wasn't very good but he definitly made that up by his enthusiasm. He was very communicative and asked several questions to the tourgroup for some extra participation.The hospital itself offers extra tours during the summer between the hours (so we had a tour at 16:30). It's advised to arrive on time since tour groups are max. 30 people. Which is the absolute max since some of the hallways and rooms are very small.The tour takes you everywhere and offers alot of information, mainly because the museum put alot of figures everywhere to resemble scenes from the past. To conclude, the museum is very impressive to visit and gives a new dimension to the city and it's past. It's a shame that the city doesn't offer more of these wonderful museums."

It is 15-17 celcius degrees inside; at the door they offer you a coat to keep you warm. There is a heavy smell inside and it is not the best attraction for the clastrophobic people.A huge ammount of medical tools and machienes from the second ww or cold war years are well preserved. The surgery rooms, patient dorms are full of realistic models. I must admit that I managed to imagine what it was like to work there in the hospital during WW2! The video at the beginning has English subtitles and English guide is very cute. She obviously was enjoying her job and everything she told was very interesting. When she mentioned about the water and medical supply shortage I was shocked. They had to use bandages taken from the dead peoples wounds... The hospital was originally designed for 200 people but had to serve 500-700 people during the siege of the city. I can write a whole a lot more but you should go see the Hospital in the Rock. Definitely. :)"

The 50-min tour was great all the time. One can have clear picture how this place served as a haven to all wounded victims of the world War 1I and 1956 revolution. The museum features how hard working doctors and volunteer nurses dedicated their life to treat all wounded shoulders/victims despite lacking of resources. Here I am reminded how noble profession a nurse to be. Definitely worth the price. Tour guide was lively and speaks well English. She was knowledgeable and anyone can ask questions as she said herself I'm passionate about history'. Highly recommended!"

We had some trouble finding this location as we had to take stairs down from the Buda castle area to get there and we didn't initially understand that. The English speaking guide was easy to understand and knowledgeable about the history of the underground building. We were taken through the nuclear bunker first (not the typical approach) and then through the hospital, which was used twice; during WWII and also during the Hungarian revolution in 1956. Both areas were very austere. There were several scenarios acted out as we went through the hospital which served to clarify the environment the patients and medical personnel faced. at the end of tour, as we left the building, there was a last scenario that included military transport vehicles and was fairly realistic.I would recommend this attraction for anyone interested in the WWII/communist era."

There was another room that they had't finished yet, so it's nice to know that the place is expanding, but fear that may make the tour seem even more rushed.However, the place was very good overall, and I would recommend you check it out if you're interested in finding out why and how they build a hospital there."

Located in a series of renovated caves, it was a functioning hospital in the 1940's especially during the war. The recreations and tour are a fascinating overview of life for the sick and wounded of Budapest during WWII."

Short film before tour was informative about the history, then you tour a short stretch of the hospital , still set up , in terms of the function of respective rooms. ie: operating theatre complete with equipment , and manequins, etc.As interesting as it was, it was quite a sobering experience, as it made very real the conditions and circumstances that people had to endure during times of war.

If you go to Matthias Church, stand with the Danube behind you, and walk towards the other side of the hill. You should see signs for The Hospital in the Rock, and you can take a lift or steps down to the street, turn right and then you're there! The tours seem to go more frequently in Summer so we only had to wait half an hour. You watch a film for about 10 minutes and then a guide takes you around the bunker. You can borrow an overcoat if you like- it's worth it as it gets quite cold in there! It's quite unbelievable how huge the bunker is- you walk through wide, well-lit tunnels which open onto many different sized rooms containing wax models of doctors and patients, as well as hospital beds, original old medical instruments and features. The guide was excellent, bringing the history of this amazing place to life in an interesting and informative way. You get a real impression of how it must have been to treat the wounded in such difficult circumstances but it doesn't feel too claustrophobic. Definitely worth a visit."

The tours leave very frequently so one can arrive at anytime and catch a tour within a few minutes of wait time. Whilst waiting the entry has many interesting artifacts on display. The tour begins with a short movie which sets you in the mood. Once inside the tunnels you certainly get caught up in the atmosphere of what hospital life was like underground, and how under the most difficult circumstances they were able to take care of the sick and wounded. The wax figures and rooms are very well done, including some humorous scenes which add a lighthearted touch to the tour. Our tour guide was a mine of information and very friendly. She interacted with everyone on the tour and got us to interact with her as well. The length of time the tour takes is perfect, you are continuously moving so you never get museum legs ( swelling from very slowly moving through a museum). This museum is packed full of history and very interesting information. The taking of photographs is not allowed, but this does not detract from the tour in anyway. The tour guide takes a photograph of anyone who would like a souvenir picture, I find this a nice touch. You can find it later on the museums official website, under the \"Visitors\" tab."

And the guide then marches the people at the front of tour to the next room and starts the commentary for that room whilst the people at the back are still looking at what's in the previous room.Either the guide has to wait for everyone to catch up, or they need to restrict the tour group sizes to a much smaller number (like 10). The people behind in the Hungarian language group had it much better, there was only three of them!And it's not like the guide has to be back within the hour for the next group, because as those at the back left she was in the corner chatting with her friends.Considering this is a premium priced attraction, I don't think this was good enough"

By visiting the museum you learn the story of the first hospital in the rocks in Budapest: how it was built, why and how important it was during the second world. There are wax statues which are very moving and the guide was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. The only downside is that the place is small and the visit ends quickly"

Absolutely genius how they use to run this we were both amazed by it. We didn't know that the tours run every hour and we luckily got on the tour so be aware of that. Also if you are under 25 and part of the EU you can get a discount. Also take a jacket. Such a fascinating place would love to go back and do it again."

If you look up and see a statue of what looks like a naked Nazi, you're going in the right direction."

The whole place is kinda creepy, and there is a weird vibe, but I think that has something to do with it being an underground hospital. You have to go on a guided tour, you are not allowed to walk around alone or else you may get lost in the tunnels. Our guide was really informative, and I learned a lot about Hungarian history and WWII. There were also wax figures everywhere imitating people who once inhabited the hospital. It sounds like a weird place to visit, but I would certainly recommend it!"

One tip- the first part of the tour , you go into a tiny room to watch a short film. The subtitles are in English and are at the bottom of the screen- so be sure to sit in the first or second row or you won't be able to read any of it. We sat in the fourth row and couldn't read any of it- but that is a minor part of the tour. Also, stay close to the guide so you will be able to get into the room to see what she is talking about. The people in the displays are very life like - you do a double take as they look so realistic. It is an excellent museum- so glad we went."

I think it was not fair that they were keeping selling tickets when they did not have enough guides. Also, the timetable was a bit messy, as they were having tour every half an hour and sometimes every hour. When our tour started they wasted long time sorting out how to divide the people into two groups with lots of waiting and disorganization. When finally we started the tour the group was still quite big that it was easy to miss the tour guide words and also have enough time to look at things. You have to follow the guide and every time she was saying \"have you got any questions\" nobody actually had questions to ask because most of the people were too far to hear what she was saying. The idea of the museum is very good and if it is not crowded I think it is an interesting and valuable museum. However, I learned more at the House of Terror which also costs half the money we paid for the Hospital in the Rock. They are two different experiences but with the House of Terror you can spend your own time to learn about the backgrounds to the events while with the Hospital you should already know what happened. I think they should also have a better customer service especially for the price they charge that is above the average museum in Budapest."

There were a great number of exhibits throughout which we passed during the tour, and to be honest we'd have needed twice as long to read all the information attached, so it all felt a little rushed. The \"worst\" part was being told there were another 10 kilometres of tunnels behind some of the doors; understandably they weren't open to the public, but it would have added a little to the \"feel\" of the place if we could see them at least, particularly as some of them were used as \"overflow\" when the wards/corridors of the hospital were filled during the siege of Budapest.

It will smell musty.2. My experience with the staff was they were both friendly and passionate about the space and the spirit in which the hospital was run.3. Yes they speak English with an accent, the whole country does. Live with it.4. The museum is not a wax works. If you are spending time looking at the figures and not listening to the story, you are missing the point. The fact that they are not perfect adds to the experience in my mind.5. It was a hospital which operated during Hungary's darkest times. I think they have remained politically neutral, as did the hospital during its operation.6. You didn't like the red dye that was representing blood in the operating theatre? I don't even know what to say....Here's my opinion: A great adventure into the past. Culturally important.

A really good guided tour and exhibition that all the family got something out of.Unlike Berlin, the post-1945 history of Budapest isn't immediately obvious. Without the signs, the Museum of Terror would be just another building, and the Hospital in the Rock Nuclear Bunker Museum is tucked around the back of the Castle and you wouldn't find it unless you were specifically looking for it.The guided tour is essential and the guides are excellent. All the guides we met were multi-lingual and spoke English and a number of other European languages fluently. In addition to the guides, the hospital is set up with a range of dioramas with wax figures that really help show how it was used and operated. A fascinating exhibition and well worth seeing."

It leaves one admiring the strength of people and the goodness of people helping each other out in times of strife and trouble.

The Hospital in the Rock is a must see for any visitor to Budapest who has even the slightest interest in history, especially WWII and the cold war. The English language tour starts on the hour every hour, and you can't go in on your own, so it's best to get here just before the hour so you can buy tickets. It's 4000fts which was a little more than we expected (Hungary is pretty cheap, after all) but it's well worth it. It starts with a 10 minute video, and I wondered what the hell we'd signed up for, but stick with it! Your guide will take you through the underground tunnels where you'll see operating rooms and wards as well as the machinery that keeps the place going. The only slight niggle we had was that the group was quite large and some of the people who ended up at the back couldn't hear the guide and started their own (noisy and disruptive) conversations. That's not really the fault of the tour guide or the venue, just people being annoying!"

This is a tour-only activity which is included in the price and leave on the hour, every hour. Tour guides speak English (plus other languages), but depending on who you get will depend on how good their English is. No photos allowed inside and a free locker for bags. You watch a 9 minute introduction video before your guide takes you away.You will explore the history of the hospital and how it changed into a bunker. They have replicated scenes in each room with wax dummies and real props, at the end you have the chance to use an air siren. Only downside is that there's not much time to read posters or stop and look at each room before the guide moves on, but as we saw, our guide finished with us and took the next group in straight after. It would help if you had an idea of Hungarian history during the war to help you piece together the story of the hospital/bunker. Finally, there are frequent steps and low ceilings. Suitable for wheelchairs/prams and children if they don't mind wax figures or loud noises.If you want to experience the 'natural' part of this cave system, the labyrinth attraction isn't far from here as the bunker/hospital is only the renovated section. There is 10km of cave in total, the bunker/hospital is 1km of that."

I feared that the museum will be just a shock attraction like the House of Terror, but was pleasently surprised.The wax figures are great and some of them made us smile or have a comment, which lightened the mood between us and the guide (Zsofi, who was great).I gave 4 and not 5 stars because of 2 things:1 hour is really not enough. There were a lot of things we did not have the time to inspect/read. 1 and a half hour would be more suitable I think.The price. Although I am aware that the upkeep cost of such an underground place must be costly, it is still pricey for the average hungarian. For the 7200 Ft price of 2 tickets for you and your (girl)friend, you could visit the Museum of Ethnography, have a walk in the Botanical Garden and after that still have money to visit the Planetarium which would be a full day of tourism instead of a 1 hour guided tour. I do not claim it is not reasonably priced, only saying if you have a limited budget it is a far stretch to visit the Hospital in the Rock.There is a saying \"you have to see the House of Terror at least once in your life\", I would rather recommend switching that experience for the Hospital in the Rock."

Essentially this is an interconnected series of caves below Buda Castle hill which was turned into an underground hospital in the 1930's. It subsequently saw action during the siege of Budapest in 1944/45, the Hungarian revolution in 1956, and the height of the Cold War. You can only experience this installation on a one hour guided tour. The tour itself takes in numerous original exhibits and our guide certainly knew his facts. A memorable and thought provoking look at fairly recent history."

There are stairs which go down, as well as an elevator, Castle Hill. At the bottom, turn right for a very short distance. In Castle Hill, there were a great number of small caves. Some of these were further excavated and many caves were joined together to form what initially became a hospital complex and later a nuclear fallout shelter bunker. The only way to gain entry is with a 4000 Ft ticket for a guided tour. Tours are at the top of the hour in either English or Hungarian. You begin with a brief film, English subtitles, about the history of the complex. Afterward, you go with your particular language guide on about a 40 minute tour. Interesting for medical/device history as well as a very limited history of the Soviet siege. About 200 figurines portraying life in the hospital. The Museum shop has a number of army surplus items - like 1970 gas masks for 2000Ft - for sale."

The tour lasts for an hour and you start with a short video about how the hospital came about, and then you head your way through the labyrinth of corridors and rooms displaying many original medical artefacts in rooms re-enacting how it would have been in its day (cramped mixed wards, operating theatres, X-Ray rooms etc). Despite it being 'underground' you don't feel claustrophobic. The rooms are well ventilated and well lit and the guide reminds you that you aren't underground as the hospital is built into a hill, which is actually an elevation.Really good value for money.

We walked 15 minutes to a bar, purchased a drink, and they booked us a taxi. The whole experience in the hospital last 60-90 minutes and was incredibly interesting. Everything looked very authentic and as though very little changes have been made to the hospital. Wax figures etc made it really easy to picture life inside the hospital, and the guide was very knowledgable. At the beginning, there is a 10 minute historical video to watch. I would recommend placing the project at a higher angle as the whole room were dodging through the video to read the English subtitles through peoples heads. I really enjoyed this trip and on the day, there was a deal for under 26 year olds which made it 2000 forint per person so definitely worth it! The caves are also next door for you to walk up."

A very interesting and informative museum actually contained in the original hospital which was built just prior to WW2 and sadly saw plenty of use during the siege of Budapest and in the Uprising in the 1950s against the Communist regime. You actually get to walk through the wards and view operating theatres etc Much of the contents are original and they claim to have over 100 waxworks taking the roles of doctors, nurses and patients. These were slightly creepy but didn't detract from a very good tour led by an excellent and well informed guide."

It starts with an informative video about the history of the place before you spend the remainder of the hour touring the hospital, secret cold war stuff and other exhibits.

By far the most fascinating tour, interesting history and a sudden realisation of the difficult timeline surrounding Hungary. Was able to support and fill in gaps in the history offered at St Stephens Basillica and Mattias Church. Be aware that you have to go on a guided tour (as not to get lost in the cave system) and therefore the price reflects this. European travellers get a discount if you're under 26 which makes things a lot cheaper. However, definitely worth full price admission in my opinion."

Take the time out. Tour lasts 60mins. But do check what times they run it. It can get cold down to 15c in the tunnels and they have jackets available, but I would rather not wear jackets which have been worn by others - but that's me."

The fee is reasonable for the amount of work they put in restoring this place! Very interesting historical data of the tunnels dag a few decades ago. The guided tour is very helpful (begins every hour), providing interresting pieces of information! Not at all tiring, the tour begins with a small video projection, in it you can also see original footage from various years. It is subtitled in English. After the video a guide escorts you to the various rooms under the rock. Pictures and videos are not allowed, so keep your eyes and ears open! The walk is almost 1km long but not at all tiring. Try to keep up with the escort, because in a big group you cannot hear her if you stand too far away. See original equipment and imagine the conditions under which so many people tried to help their compatriots in the last decades. A group photo will be taken at the end of the tour from the guide, you can download it free of charge. The place is simply amazing! Buy something from the store (to support them and keep the place open). One of the most interesting alternative thematical museums I have visited. A really hidden pearl!!!!! Do not miss it!"

My favorite museum in Budapest.The entrence fee is a little higher than other museums in the area, but thats only because you can't get in alone.The museum is on the buda facing side of castle hill, very close to mathias church and fisherman's bastion, there are a lot of nice ( although very touristy ) shops on the way, and if you have time - and its not to crowded, its nice to windowshop.There's a staircase and an elevator that goes down to the museum, and signs everywhere on castle hill.The museum is absolutly amazing.You enter the caves with a short movie. We watched it with english subtitles, and felt that we missed something, but everything you miss in the movie the guide can give you and much more, so we enjoyed the historical scenes.When we entered the caves we were surprised to see the amount of medical equipment preserved, and the life sized wax figures of doctors, nurses and wounded, we really felt that we could understand what happened.Our guide (anika I think her name was) answered all our questions in very good english, and showed great knowledge.Then we went to the nuclear bunker and concluded the tour.I only wish we had time to wander by ourselves after the tour, and go over all the wonderful exhibitions more thoroughly, but apparently many people get lost in the caves."

But this museum - it was really and genuinely fascinating. They do tours every hour on the hour so it's more like a guided visit to an attraction than a museum. Visiting this museum gave me some appreciation of the trials the Hungarian people went through during WWII and under the Soviet Regime. The exhibits were thoughtfully put together, the guide spoke clear English, and the history was so interesting. It is truly a hospital AND nuclear bunker in the cave system under Buda Hill. Skipping this attraction is truly doing a disservice to your visit to Budapest. It was one of my favorite parts of my 21-day trip - that should say something!"

She spoke excellent English and had a lovely sense of humour as she led a large group through what could be a pretty grim bunker. Coming from Aus, the idea of nuclear bunkers is pretty strange to us. The Hospital in the Rock began as a war hospital in Buda but was set up during the Cold War as a nuclear shelter. The museum itself is relatively new. The wax figures, while a bit 'old school museum' give you a good picture of what the hospital/shelter would have been like. The tour takes an hour and is very informative. It is obviously all underground and might be one to avoid if you don't like enclosed spaces. I'm really glad I did this tour. If you have a spare hour or so, give it a go. It's so different to most other tourist attractions."

I didn't rate this experience as excellent or very good because you rushed through the hospital too much - there really is little time to actually study the exhibits properly. There is also a bizarre modern day exhibit of a military helicopter in the hospital that just makes no sense. Also, the restriction on photography is just greedy. This museum has the potential to be fantastic but as its currently orgainzed it just does not work well. There is also a totally incongruous display glorifying military medics (complete with helicopter) that is out of place in the museum. It was also frustrating not to be allowed to take photos. This is a fascinating place to visit and the staff are friendly so it is well worth a visit."

A tour of the Hospital in the Rock is well worth the time if for nothing more than to open your eyes to the misery the poor people of Hungary have endured over the years. Knowing that the Castle (no longer there) was invaded 31 times over the last few hundred years and then went through first German and then Russian occupation in more recent times, and then to walk around the underground tunnels that were turned into a state of art hospital during the second world war and then became a nuclear shelter during the early 60's is amazing, well worth a visit"

It's actually better that way - there's no way anyone who didn't work there would know how to get out once you'd gone in! The tour is interesting and provides some good history to the hospital. The mannequins make it feel less authentic if anything but it was still interesting to see what it might have been like to have been working in the hospital or there as a patient. The tour guide was informative but had obviously done quite a few tours that day already - she seemed slightly bored. The tour group was also way too big and there were times when we couldn't hear the tour guide because we were at the back/in another part of the room. It was also a little rushed, especially at the beginning. But definitely worth a visit!"

The tours start on the hour every hour and you can't enter without a tour, so do remember that when you visit as we were 40minutes early and there isn't anything nearby to look at so we just waited on a bench by the entrance. Our tour guide was great and very informative- the visit gave a detailed insight into what life was like during WW2 and beyond for this underground hospital and the wax figures capture scenes from this time. Their giftshop is pretty quirky too and you can buy a genuine gas mask/ mess tin from that era if that's your thing!Really really glad we went and would highly recommend it. If you're a teacher in the EU you can get in for free if you can show a teacher's card, and if you're under 25 entry is HUF 2,000 and over 25 is HUF 4,000."

This is in Hungarian with English subtitles. These are at the bottom of the screen, so if you need them try and sit at the front or on the first row on the raised block.Then the main tour started. Our guide was Nori, and her English was faultless. She spoke clearly and at a good volume so could be heard anywhere in the group. We moved through the hospital seeing how it was used during WW2 and the 1956 revolution, then on the way back we saw the equipment that kept it operational such as the water and air systems.Lots of information about the use of the rocks as a hospital, air-raid control centre, and then it's later design as a nuclear bunker.Informative, interesting, and well presented."

Contrary to the publicity displayed, there was no tour available in our native language. We got there, paid the 4000 HUF fee and waited half an hour. The crowd (more than FORTY PEOPLE) is then gathered in a movie theater as the late-comers rush and disturb the video. But... the screen is quite low on the wall and the video has not been dubbed into English. Reading subtitles is fine but as the chairs were high and from the position of the screen, they were unreadable, concealed by the backs and heads of the people sitting. First frustration. Then, the tour starts. The no-photo rule appears out of nowhere. The guide, Zsofi, had a very good English but the tour lacked practical information about the daily life downstairs. It was very claustrophobic to be surrounded by that many people in such small places and sometimes the guide was simply inaudible. I regret it, it could have been a fun visit. The entrance fee is huge though and I wonder where the profits go."

You have to go as part of a tour, but it is a very good tour! A good pace with lots of intersting facts. The waxwork figures are very effective and help you to imagine how the hospital functioned in the second world war. Well worth a visit, especially if you want an overview of how WW2 impacted upon Budapest."

No photos are allowed. Although the guide does take a group photo at end and you can access it a couple of days later from their website. I found the English group quite large, maybe it was very busy because of the weather, but it meant we all couldn't get into some of the rooms and hear the guide. Also meant couldn't read the bits and pieces on the walls because of the number of people standing up against them.Before the tour there is a 10-15 minute film to watch which is in Hungarian with english subtitles, again very interesting but if you are not in the front two rows you will struggle to read the subtitles as they are at the bottom of the screen. I had to peep between peoples heads in the front row and I was in the second row. A few people did comment on this in our group.It's well worth a visit though."

I think the entrance fee was around a couple thousand HUF for two people (they have some applicable discounts but none applied to us). The Hospital is a very important piece of Hungarian history during the World Wars and also the Cuban Missile Crisis. A lot of heroic doctors and nursing staff made the difference in many lives during very difficult times. It's really great to see them remembered in this way. The staff are young, knowledgeable and friendly. This is a guided tour and takes an hour. It's amazing how large the underground facility really is, at one point the guide will give you a point of reference from above ground so you can visualize where exactly you are.

The Hospital in the Rock served as a safe zone for the sick and injured of Budapest, and the many Jewish doctors that worked there (WW2) and during the many conflicts this stunningly beautiful city has endured over the past 100 years or so . The place was later put to use as a nuclear bunker/hospital during communist times and served the civil population once again during the Hungarian uprising of 1956.The wax models, in my opinion were superfluous to requirements and some reminded me of my aunt who is downright scary! Our guide was a young, fit and probably hyper-active guy called Milan, lovely guy, spoke perfect English but could have given any Olympic sprinted the slip in a race. His tour was very informative and he readily answered any questions put to him but it would have been better if he could have done the tour at half speed rather than the full throttle he did on the day, However, this doesn't appear to be Milan's fault as the lady who did a second group tour was quicker still and had long since finished before Milan. Message to Milan, cut down on those fizzy drinks with e numbers in the ingredients, drink decaffeinated coffee and tea, and don't under any circumstances eat any more M and Ms, chocolate or peanut!!Well done Milan and well done to the municipality for opening this interesting glimpse in to the recent past to the public.Budapest is a great city and the people there are among the most friendly in Europe and prices are still very reasonable but go discover for yourself and say hello to Milan for me!."

After spending the morning at Vajdahunyad Castle, I took the metro to De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r, and despite the warmth of late August, I decided to walk over and up Buda Hill. However, by the time I reached the top I was in desperate need of some cool and decided that this location would offer that (in fact it provides jackets for those less well insulated than I). Since this place was on my optional list, I am glad the heat made the choice for me.Quick navigational note, if you reach the top of the hill from the funicular or straight up from the Clark Adam ter, and you walk towards Matthias Church, you will see a sign to the left of the first restaurant, pointing out the way to the museum. This will start you walking down a hill, along Palota, where you will soon run into a fork. Take the right hand option, which starts you climbing again into a residentially looking area. There is also an elevator, for those closer to the church.With the number of younger people visiting Budapest, it is a smart that 25 and under is half price. For those of above that and not yet at 62, it is expensive for Budapest. More a price I would expect in the part of the world with which I am more familiar.Starts with a 5-10 minute movie, for my tour it was in Magyar (or I assume so) with English sub-titles. This gives a good background on the facility, when and why it was used. From there you are led through the tunnels on a 45 minute walk (covering a decent distance, but not a difficult walk), where details are added to the videos.In ways, I found much of what you see is similar to what is seen when visiting a warship (HMS Belfast or USS Midway). While at the same time offering a great book end to the Churchill War Rooms (that I visited last year). Similar purpose, but in so many ways completely the opposite (from the side and type of people it housed, the front line aspect, and so on). Like much of Budapest, it provided a history I did not know and have spent little time thinking about.The only issue, it turned out to be a big group. This led us to get strung out in some of the narrow passaged or rooms, which meant you were not always able to hear the tour guide start an explanation of an area."

Unsurprising as if you're building a hospital in a rock, the list of possible sites is quite limited.Anyway - we had a first class hour-long tour of the former hospital / nuclear shelter. The conditions were cramped, simple, cool and a little damp. Quite how anyone got better in these conditions is beyond me. But it was fascinating to have this window into a grimmer bygone world.There are lots of waxworks, some of which were quite naff. Don't let that put you off.Bizarrely, there is also a small contemporary section on a Hungarian SAS team that saved a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan injured by the Taliban in 2011. It sat awkwardly with the World War hospital bunk beds. Don't let that put you off either - we really enjoyed the tour.If I was going to be critical, I would say only that the tour was a little rushed - and the group could have been given a little more time to look at the rooms.

The Hospital in the Rock does indeed have a fascinating history owing to its unique location and different usages, but is curated in an old fashioned and frankly laughable manner. Waxworks always look absurd, and the horror show displayed here detracts from the power of the story, and left me stifling inappropriate giggles. After viewing a few rooms of what can only be described as an underground hospital filled with waxwork dummies, it all became a bit monotonous.The historical angle is also somewhat nuanced to gloss over that tricky Axis alliance, and instead celebrate the heroism of the 1956 uprising. The incomprehensible addition of a helicopter - an uncommon site within most bunker facilities - was apparently there to honour Hungarian Special Forces. Nothing to do with the actual site whatsoever. The coverage of the change of use to nuclear bunker was brief to say the least.At 3600 fl, it's not cheap, the displays are ludicrous and old fashioned, with some of the information about the site's usage either notably downplayed or irrelevant. With a more modern and interactive approach, and an abandonment of the necessity of the tour guides, this could be a worthy tribute to the legacy of the site."

The many adverts for this in the castle district have maps showing the way to it which we couldn't make sense of, so it was hard to find. You need to go to Holy Trinity Square, line up the central monument in front of you with Matthius church behind you and then go down the street straight ahead until its end at which you will find both a covered stairway and an elevator to take you to the next level down at which you turn hard right to reach the entrance to this attraction.You can only inspect on a tour, so in the high season, visit early so that if current the tour (hourly) is full, you can book a later tour & return for it.The use of the natural caves in the hill for an underground hospital during WWII and then nuclear bunker subsequently is well illustrated by the use of dummies in conjunction with genuine uniforms & equipment."

Unlike some other reviewers, didn't find the place to be cold or chilly.However I would like to offer a suggestion to the facility's staff: when nearly everyone visiting wants to take the English language tour, then you might want to add an extra English tour guide.After watching a short introductory movie, the staff asked that Hungarian speakers go with one tour guide and English speakers go with another tour guide. The two Hungarians in the audience essentially had a personal tour, while everyone else had to somewhat struggle to hear the lone English speaking tour guide. It wasn't the fault of the tour guide. It was simply because the English speaking group was too large.Regardless, we enjoyed visiting the Hospital in the Rock, and recommend it as an interesting hour in Buda."

We visited the Hospital in the rock when we were in the Castle district, we found it very interesting and a contrast to the other attractions that we had visited on our trip. It was well organised , with a one hour tour , with an English speaking tour guide, it gave a good insight to the workings of the hospital through some very hard times and the transformation into a nuclear fall out bunker. Try and leave some time when in Budapest for some history, this fits the bill."

The facilities were primitive and unhygienic.  Many died through infection when there were shortages of water and bandages. To overcome the bandage problem they were taken from the deceased and reused. To accommodate the wounded, beds were pushed together to enable three to lie in two beds. The more serious patients were placed on the outside so as it was easier for the nurses to treat them. When the beds were full, patients lay on stretchers on the floor.Tip:- at the beginning of the tour a film is shown. Sit near the front to view the English translation. Kayjohn"

It was built in the 1930's and was stretched to the limit during the siege of Budapest in the Second World war. During the cold war the communist regime kept it top secret, to be used as a hospital and nuclear shelter in case of nuclear attack. It is now a very well maintained museum with regular tours in English and Hungarian. The clinic rooms, wards , operation theatres are all exactly preserved with original equipment and wax models of staff and patients.The huge generators which provided the power and fresh air apparently still function. Unfortunately no photography is allowed inside, and the tiny souvenir shop has no postcards either. If you are a doctor or nurse and have ID to prove it you get a discount on the entry fee.

We stumbled across Hospital in the Rock while in the area for the Fisherman's Bastion - I'm so glad we did as this was not in our guide book and we would have missed it otherwise.The Hospital in the Rock is a huge cave system which was a hospital during various states of unrest in the city. It was also a nuclear bunker, although did not have to be used for these purposes. The tour around the hospital takes around 1 hour, and is reasonably priced for this amount of time - lots of discounts are offered for under 26, over 65, students etc. The hospital features several exhibitions brought to life with wax work dummies. I personally was not overly keen on the wax works as I love to visit places that are hugely authentic and reasonably untouched. However, that's just my personal preference - I cannot criticise the wax works themselves which were so realistic and a great way to bring the exhibition to life if you're into that type of attraction. My only other complaint is that the tour groups are quite big. It was hard to hear from the back, which meant we had to look at things quickly to ensure we stuck near the guide and didn't fall behind. Perhaps this is less of an issue if you avoid a midday tour in August! All in all I would recommend this attraction for a unique, interesting experience."

The hospital was built underground and used during WWII, then as a Soviet nuclear fallout shelter. The original hospital equipment and rooms are there, a bit creepy, but gives a sense of the craziness there during the siege and WWII. The wax figures are not exactly well done, more of a caricatures of the historical figures, but interesting to look at. The nuclear fall out shelter that was added is interesting and almost comical about how little people knew about the effects of radiation. The tour includes a guided narration that is informative. You get to try out the air siren and to see the boiler room that operates to this day!"

We took the hospital in the rock tour by chance as we were just wandering around the castle and happened to be at the entrance as the 1 hour tour was due to start. Definitely worth the visit and let's you really see into how life was during the second world war for the many German and Hungarian troops under siege in Budapest at that time. It is a very comprehensive tour even showing the nuclear shelter that is built inside. It is not the happiest of tours as the hardships endured and the sacrifices that doctors and nurses went through were amazing. A very good 1 hour trip if you are around the Castle District. Check the timings as you don't really want to be hanging around waiting for the trip as there is not much around that part of the castle."

The tour starts with a movie describing the history of the hospital/nuclear bunker. It is in Hungarian but with English subtitles. After, our guide took us through the museum. Coats are provided if needed because the caves make the museum a cooler temperature. The guide was easy to understand and very knowledgeable. You learn about how the hospital was used through viewing wax figures and furniture set up in the rooms as it was during the 1930-1960s. You even get to see the machinery that was brought in when the museum was used as a nuclear bunker. The only thing that would make this place better is if you could take pictures inside or even if they had pictures available in the shop to buy because it is such a cool place! Definitely worth a visit while in Budapest. "

We waited about 20 minutes for the \"English\" guided tour, but kept occupied by the interesting items available in the \"shop\". We were very tempted to purchase a genuine cold war era gas mask for our Son, or even one of the original glass syringes as an oddity. In addition to the fascinating history of the Hospital from WWII, the Hungarian Uprising of 1956, and the new additions from the cold war, the bunker and caves are a desirable respite from the 100 degree heat of mid July."

They quickly gloss over the fact that Hungary cooperated with the Nazis and ignore the fact that they aided in the extermination of 500,000 Jews.

Our group was not too large on the day we visited, so we were still able to hear the tour guide and see everything. The wax figures are a little hokey, but they do add to the atmosphere. The tour guide was pleasant and spoke English very well, though his spiel was pretty canned.A truly fascinating part of history! I was very happy we convinced our family to join us - everyone who went on the tour was pleased with it."

            "review": "An interesting insight into an underground emergency hospital of WW2.. This is a little off the usual tourist trail of Budapest, but for those with a particular interest in medical history (like me) it is a must! The Buda hill was naturally full of small caves in a network, and this network was converted into a fully functional hospital for use during the Nazi attacks of the second world war, during the siege of Budapest. Later, it was prepared as a nuclear shelter. The tour takes place at hourly intervals, so you need to book ahead, and it is a little chilly in the cave network. Much of the original equipment in the overcrowded wards is on show, and in operating theatres etc. along with the remarkable engineering to keep the air fresh and the water flowing. Excellent guide. Note, if you are over 65 and an EEA citizen, you get reduced entrance rates, and free if over 70 and from the EEA."

I was really interested in the hospital section unfortunately the tour for the English group was at 30 persons. ( the other group was only 7 I wish I could have understood Magyar )We could not see what was being talked about until after she had done all the talking and had a hard time to hear or learn about these parts of the tour. By the end of the tour we weaseled our way closer to the front ( hard to do in such tight - spaces) so we could hear and see what was being said. It is a fascinating place and incredible to realize what state of the art it was for its time and to be in caves underground what history. You can not take pictures so that makes being able to hear and see the exhibits as they are being talked about important."

It is signposted from Castle Hill, but the easiest way to find it is to take the small pedestrianised road off the square outside St Matthias Church. At the end of the road is an elevator in a wall and the museum is just to the right at the bottom. Entry is by tour only, English language tours are on the hour every hour and it's worth noting that they offer a discount to health service personal so take some ID with you.The hospital was created during WWII by linking together naturally occuring caves in the Buda hills. They stay at a constant cool temperature, but thick jackets and coats are provided in case you get cold, there is no need to carry them with you if it is warm outside.The tour takes about 50 minutes and the guides lead you through the caves visiting the fully equipped emergency room, operating theatre and wards where patients had to 'top and tail' in bed to fit them all in. The wax dummies are rather dubious, but they actually add to the atmosphere.Experiencing the cramped conditions and seeing the basic equipment of the time really makes you appreciate the dedication of the medical profession at the time, especially considering that it was a Red Cross hospital, so they treated all those in need regardless of which side they were fighting for. Remarkable!The hospital was only fully functioning for a number of years. With the advent of the Cold War, parts of it were then converted into a nuclear bunker. It is still fully functionable and for this reason no photographs are allowed during your visit.Well worth a visit."

A one-hour guided tour takes through the emergency hospital that operated in the caves beneath Buda Castle during the Second World War. You will see examination rooms, patient wards, operating rooms which contain original furniture, instruments, and equipment. The exhibit is enhanced with wax figures which serve to reenact events of the time. You will also see the Soviet Cold War Bunkers that operated in the 1960's. Our tour guide was great and the tour takes about 1 hour."

You start with a short video telling you the history and then get a walk-through of the hospital and Communist bunker areas. The hospital has actual equipment of the era, along with some creepy mannequins representing the medical staff and patients. There is a lot of history here and it is fascinating to learn. Tour takes about an hour. You do not need to make reservations ahead of time. Tours are in several languages - an English tour was offered right as it opened at 10 a.m. which is what we took, and there were only about 9 people in our group. Part of the tour loops back on itself and at that point the place got very crowded with large bus and/or cruise tour groups, so if you can get there early I would recommend it. It's a little chilly in the caves. They do offer some heavier jackets for guests to wear (very Communist-era looking coats) but I think it's better to BYO. You cannot take photos in the caves."

Hewn into the hill beneath the bastion, this is more a stroll through a forgotten side of Hungary's history. From the welcoming staff, perhaps surprised to see visitors, through a fascinating guided tour which went beyond the staid stuff one expects from a museum, the Hospital in the Rock allows you to see just how the Hungarian people survived in the last days of the second world war as well as feeling the sort of paranoia that existed under the Communist regime. There's a wealth of artefacts from both times as well as a series of evocative tableaux recreating the atmosphere. Time and money well spent. Take time to have a look in the \"gift\" shop which contains, not the usual tourist tat, but genuine Cold War memorabilia priced much more reasonably that anywhere in town"

These caves were built into an elaborate underground hospital fortified against Allied bombs during the Horthy regime before and during World War II and then shielded (more or less) against anticipated nuclear radiation during the Cold War. The hospital's period ambiance and equipment has been beautifully maintained. An inspired staff member has gone to infinite pains to create a mannikin world of medical and military personnel and their grimacing bloodied patients. It's a medical geek's dream: storage rooms of 1930s medical supplies; operating rooms equipped with original blood transfusion machines. The excellent tour guide didn't gloss over realities. During the war the hospital \"employed\" enslaved Jewish doctors. When water failed, or power failed, everyone crouched in the stink in the darkness. I was amazed and moved by the detail and care that went into this museum and tour -- and very grateful that at the end in the gift shop we bought a surplus WWII gas mask and walked out into the sunshine."

The museum has many supplies and equipment from the period. You must take the provided guided tour and tours were provided in English or Hungarian. My only complaint, as we moved from room to room the tour guide did not wait for everyone to get into the area before she started speaking. She did nothing to hurry people along or to even assure everyone got in. People just kind of stood wherever they wanted, and in some of the smaller areas, other people could not get in to see or hear. My suggestion would be to stay close to the guide so you can see and hear."

We were able to get an English speaking tour shortly after we arrived--with our tour guide being a young woman from Russia!. Fascinating to see how Hungarians dug out old caves and turned them into a hospital, and later a bomb shelter for use during WWII and the Cold War--and how they dealt with the changing politics in their country."

The tour itself had too many people, the tour guide wasn't very good at projecting her voice and overall, the entire tour had a rather claustrophobic feeling about it. The gift shop at the end was peculiar. It sold very little in the way of merchandise, and was more like an tiny overpriced corner shop.

Each stop is laid out as it was with wax models capturing a scene; the guide says a few words, and then you shuffle round the display for a few moments before moving on. It is interesting to a certain point, but the novelty of the place wore off after 20-30 minutes, and the guide really didn't inspire too much interest with his text \u2013 although there were a few very good details in there, just a shame they were the exception rather than the norm.

For those who (understandably) complained that the groups are too big and the tours too widely spaced (1 hour intervals), be advised - as of April 2015 tours are offered every 30 minutes. For those who try to find this tour using a town map \u2013 good luck! However, it\u2019s easily located by walking directly away from Matthias Church (Castle Hill) to the stairs & elevator. Our guide Sophie was knowledgeable, professional, articulate and fun. English skills are A+, spoken loud and clearly enough so that the whole group was able to follow everything she said. This relatively small (1 hour) tour is one of the best kept secrets of Budapest. The underground facility served a vital purpose during WWII and again during the bloody Hungarian uprising in 1956. Then, during the years of the cold war between the Soviets and the USA it served another very secret purpose. Since my wife and I were children doing \u201cdrop and cover\u201d exercises during those turbulent years it was chilling and ironic to hear about the threat of nuclear war from the Hungarian point of view. It certainly never occurred to anyone of my age that people in Hungary were afraid an attack from the USA! Now we have a new prospective and a new way to relate to these wonderful fellow citizens of our planet."

This became a secret place for rebels against the soviets in the 1959 rebellion and later became a nuclear bomb shelter. Medical staff treated from 60 to 600 patients in these sunless, dank corridors. Amazing heroic efforts by doctors and nursing staff."

It was also used as a fallout shelter in case of potential nuclear disasters.So glad it was found again and you can view the museum.I would recommend visiting."

The entrance fee is fairly reasonable: around $10-12 USD, less than $10 for physicians, military and law enforcement. This fee includes a guided tour, lasting approximately 1 hour. My guide was a very good speaker, her English was more than adequate, and she provided an excellent level of detail about the museum.I really enjoyed seeing all of the original equipment and features of the hospital dating back to the 1940s. The fact that this facility began as a hospital and ended its service life as a nuclear fallout shelter is fascinating, especially considering its location.My only complaints about the tour process are that you are not allowed to take any photos and we didn't stay long enough at each stop for my liking. This could have been due to the fact that we had approximately 10-12 people in our group, and the passageways in the facility are small, so in the best interest of all, the guide elected to move just a bit faster.Regardless, the Hospital in the Rock will be loved by any history buffs and is a great addition to your Budapest touring plans."

The later tours after 10 and 11 seemed to have larger groups, so might be a good idea to go during early times or maybe later times.They have a gift shop that sells real gas masks and other vintage military goods like chow kits, helmets, compass (one that I saw) from Hungarian and Czech army surplus supplies from 50s and 70s, history buffs and military antique collectors rejoice!The tour itself was very cool and informative. They take you through all the parts of the hospital, reception, operation rooms, showers, beds, machine rooms and tell you really cool facts and point out different tidbits. The guides obviously are very good at what they do and are genuinely interested in sharing the history of the place.Every room was setup with realistic wax figures dressed in historical clothing, soldiers, nurses, bloodied bandages..There's even a funny part in the middle but I won't spoil the surprise..Lockers and cabinets were all filled with actual stuff used during hospital's time, big glass bottles still filled with old chemicals and medicines.Definitely a must do while in Budapest.

The second tour guide was basically impossible to understand and spoke so softly that people could not here. The information shared on both tours differed and should be standardized.So, I think that this attraction is worthwhile visiting but the guides should be better trained, especially since a lot of non-native English speakers take the English tour. I am a native English speaker and have lived abroad in multiple countries so I am used to people speaking English with heavy accents and I found it almost impossible to understand one of the guides. My first visit was with my elderly parents and they enjoyed it and were able to easily navigate through the visit. They also enjoyed the visit because it was cooler inside and a nice break from the heat. There were discounts for senior citizens with EU passports, nurses and teachers."

The wax figures aren't the most skilled I've seen, which I guess is because we weren't at Mme Tussaud's, but I wouldn't have minded seeing some rooms without wax figures.

Subsequent events meant that several hundred wounded were taken there for the care of the Red Cross.On visiting you travel through the caves where life-size models and their equipment give an excellent, tho grim, idea of how it would have been. good audio guides provided.Not to be missed!"

If you are interested in the history of Budapest and you are willing to relive the - sometimes painfully vivid - scenes of a WWII hospital and Cold War nuclear shelter, don't miss this museum. It will make you think and probably leave a bitter taste in your mouth, but certainly a very valuable and (literally) deep experience. I don't think it's suitable for anyone with claustrophobia."

Close to Fisherman\u2019s Bastion and the Royal Palace, the Hospital in the Rock is a little hidden away, but is an unusual but must-see attraction in the city. The tour consists of a 15 minute video about the history of the hospital, and then a 45 minute guided tour of the premises, where you get to see pretty much everything \u2013 from the wards, to the operating theatre, to the machinery rooms. It\u2019s an incredible place bearing in mind it\u2019s situation inside a hillside \u2013 and the presence of a full helicopter in one of the rooms is pretty amazing \u2013 and the fact that much of what is displayed is original means that it\u2019s easy to imagine what life in the hospital during WW2 must have been like. Our guide knew his lines, but lacked a little personality."

If I've lost the chance of seeing this I would be so frustrated.. The tour is well organized with guides who speak a very fluent English with joy and ambition to serve.. The historical background was mesmerising.. They are explaining every detail of the facility and even let you try a few of the equipment.. It's a bit cold underneath the ground but there are coats in case you don't have anything to keep you warm but they are a bit old and don't seem very clean(they are serving thousands of people every day, what else can you expect) but it's totally worth your hour.. I am a doctor of dentistry and I am super excited and satisfied with the tour and details.. It's better than the art museum in the castle imo.. In arts museum even the attendants were not able to speak English other than \"no, yes, okay\""

I must say this really out did my expectations, I loved it. The groups tour guide, Agi had lots of knowledge and a good understanding of English and made the journey around the old hospital very gripping. I was visiting solo as my other family members don't like small spaces and I didn't feel uncomfortable being there on my own as the groups are a good size. For those of you who are nervous that these spaces might feel enclosed, they are actually quite open and it feels like being in a basement rather than deep underground. I learnt a lot about the history of Hungary through the last 30 years and there were lots of interesting models and pieces of medical equipment on view. I preferred the hospital section to the nuclear bunker area but both were eye-opening. Well worth a visit, the staff were friendly and it has been one of the highlights of my trips to Budapest!"

There is a cheaper entrance rate for EU citizens if you have proof of identity, so the price was very reasonable. English tours went every hour, on the hour. We were left to watch a short historical video (in Hungarian with English subtitles) before the tour properly started. You are told NOT to take photos, so bear this in mind. Our guide was very enthusiastic and tried to engage us by asking questions, and was happy for you to ask things too. She was very friendly and did a great job considering the other tourists in our group were not the most cheerful bunch!!Everything in the place is original which was fascinating, and there was a good mix of humour and seriousness/information. I'd recommend visiting this place after having got your bearings of Budapest itself, as you will appreciate the guide's explanations better when they refer to specific places.The historical aspect came right up to the present day which was interesting, and there was a really cool helicopter which they had to get down there in pieces and re-build for their exhibit! The mechanical areas were less interesting to me personally (generators, machines etc) as there was no real emotional or real life stories to go with them like in other areas.The tour lasted an hour, and were were not rushed around. There is a small gift shop where you can buy original gas masks, cutlery etc as well as drinks/small snacks."

She told us what is what when leading us from one room to another, but the explanation is quite superficial and general, as plain as reciting a passage from a book. When I pay 3600 HUF to have a professional guide, I expect something more than that. Maybe some interaction with the audience? Maybe a smile on her face? Maybe giving some interesting story one could not find by reading wikipedia? Rather, i saw a guide who did not show much interest to her job.With such an experience, I would not rate it as a thumb up or recommended thing to do.

Having an interest in history and working in health I found the tour interesting and got a slant on Hungarian history and the siege of Budapest that was new and interesting. Certainly if you work in health or hospitals also a very interesting tour.We went on a Monday and there were only 4 people on the tour so we had time to ask questions and the guide was friendly and informative.Note that if you are taking children being a hospital a lot of the rooms have dummies with bloody bandages and my son found that a bit creepy. Children should also be encouraged to go to the toilet before the tour starts.Only museum I have ever visited where the souvenir shop sold gasmasks!We walked from the large tramstop, but a quicker way would be to get the bus to the fortess and go to the stairs on the far side facing away from the Danube and Fisherman's Bastion, go down them and walk along the road."

It's slightly out of the way of the main sights on Castle Hill so you'll need to keep an eye out for it.The only way that you can see the place is by a guided tour. Tours leave on the hour and last an hour. Full priced tickets cost 3,600 HUF. We got a 30% discount as part of a hop on - hop off bus tour (Budapest Sightseeing). The tour starts with a short film on the history of the hospital/bunker. It's in Hungarian with English subtitles. Try to sit near the front as, due to the people sitting in front of you, it will be hard to read the subtitles otherwise.The tour guide spoke perfect English and was knowledgeable. However, the tour group was quite large (25 people) and as the area is quite cramped the ability to spend much time looking at the exhibits was limited. As someone else has mentioned, it would be far better to be allowed look around by yourself with an audio guide. Also, no photography is allowed. I'm not sure why this is the case.It's worth a look simply due to the uniqueness of it being an underground hospital but with a bit of a reorganisation it could be greatly improved as an experience."

It was a little hard to find but we eventually made out way there after seeking directions from the locals. Guided tours are mandatory and there is one every hour if I recall correctly. The tour was interesting and started with a great 10 minute film about the history of the hospital. The next 50 minutes were spent going through the labyrinth of tunnels and viewing the ultra-realistic depictions of the hospital. Our guide was very patient and explained the exhibits in a very interesting way. There were quite a few interesting displays inside the museum, such as a depiction of a typical surgery and a drawer full of surgical instruments from the past. There was even a huge helicopter located inside one of the rooms. One of the highlights of the museum was the portable air raid sirens which we were allowed to try out. In the final part of the tour, we were able to view the machinery that kept the hospital running, although we were not allowed to touch them as they were still fully functional. At the end of the tour, there was a small souvenir shop selling interesting souvenirs like a piece of the iron curtain and even actual gas masks. We would definitely come again in our next visit to Budapest!"

I had the GPS set to the castle which i was eager to see along with the beautiful view from the hill. We found this museum while searching for a parking spot. How lucky we were. We booked the tour with hesitation because we did bot have any prior knowledge about this place. The staff were very helpful taking their time to explain to us what is inside which made us excited to go in. The 10 minutes video is a brief story about the place and its history. As other reviewers said, the room is small and sitting in the back is bothering because you wont be able to read the english subtitles. As the tour started our english guide started taking her time in every room to make sure everyone in the group sees it all. She was loud and clear that you can hear her even at the end of the group. She was very informative and answered all of our questions. The place is amazing with the history it beholds about the war and post war period. It is great to be in such a historic location to know what happened in WWii from the Hungarian perspective. I would highly recommend this tour. The downsides of this tour are being a full hour underground without being able to leave when you like. Some people feel bothered of this, i was fine but i wouldn't have handled more. the ventilation is great and the temperature is good. You do not need to use the coats they provide."

The hospital is very well presented and the tour guide was excellent. Budapest struggled during the last year or so of WW2, being Nazi allies when things were going badly and the Russians occupied the city the situation became very tough but this hospital took in all sick people, regardless of nationality which has to be admired. Very interesting tour, highly recommended."

Speaking fluent English she enhanced the experience and made it feel even more real.It's 3600 HUF per person for a tour of one hour, and it's totally worth it. The tour is departing every hour. When we arrived there, the next hour tour was fully booked, so we made a reservation for the next one and meanwhile took a walk around the castle.

The tour starts with a short film that gives some historical background, then you have the guided your which takes about 40 minutes. Tip: With the Budapest Card, we paid 30% less for entry.

Our guide was amazing (there are multiple reasons as to why the tours are guided and why you can't just wonder through by yourself, however she tried to take her time so everyone had optimum opportunity to look at everything) she told us lots of amazing stories and facts and asked us questions to get us involved too. The wax figures are a bit basic/odd but this does not detract from the overall experience. You are not allowed to take pictures which is a shame but the guide takes a pic of everyone together when there (you don't have to be in it) and you can get it free off the website.

The guide told us that all the exhibits were originals but didn't allow sufficient time for us to look at them so we did feel quite rushed. Having said that we found the place fascinating and we were glad we went. Be sure you check out the different ticket prices.

The wax models give an idea of how cramped it really must've been when times were hard. Our tour guide Timi (sorry for spelling?) was so nice and knowledgeable, able to answer all questions and even through in some jokes too. The place is fascinating and the tunnels just keep going! Well worth a visit, cant believe its not advertised as much as some of the other museums.From what we understood its ran on a volunteer basis and the only money made is from tickets and andy gifts bought from the shop!

Just a short walk from St. Matthias (several blocks), this is a little known facet of history - a complete hospital built into the stone caves on the Buda side - was mainly finished in time for the 1944 invasion and apparently was used both by the Hungarians and the Germans (although the 2 types of patients were treated separately). Hallways and rooms stretch deep into the rock and the guide was extremely helpful in explaining the history and use. Following the was, it was also used during the cold war as an emergency escape and treatment hospital for those who might be affected by a nuclear explosion. Weird but fascinating.

Tours are offered at the top of the hour in English and Hungarian (split into two different groups) and last about an hour. The hospital was used during WWII and again during the late 1950s.

The guide was open to questions at any time during the tour.The guide gave lots of information on the different usage of the tunnels and rooms through the years. Rooms used for specific purposes were well presented with wax dummies wearing copies of clothing and uniforms from the appropriate era, and some original equipment where possible. In addition there were information posters and photographic displays, some of which had English translations below the Hungarian.There is a shop at the entrance selling a number of items related to the use as a hospital and as a nuclear bunker, the prices of which were on the whole, not particularly expensive.The only reason I have only given a 4 rating is that I would have liked a bit more time to be able to read and study the posters and related text that was on the walls of various rooms. That said, I do think it is worthwhile visiting."

The tour was really useful and although it takes an hour it romps along at a rapid pace and is over before you know it. The caves can be chilly but you can borrow a military style cape for the tour and you can have a go at an indoor air raid siren. There is lots of equipment in situ so you do get a feel for how it must have felt to be there when it was operational. There was a no photo rule in place when we were there, however they do take a group photo which goes on their website. If you wear the cape, you get an awesome photo.The gift shop is bonkers. Coming from the UK the concept of selling off original items is strange, but certainly would come with much higher price tickets. Original gas masks, bandages, map case and all sorts of strange surplus is available for a genuinely unique souvenir. Lastly, the English speaking guide (Sophie) gave an interesting and engaging talk throughout the tour. We left with a sense of understanding Hungary's recent past and the challenges that face it now, which is quite an achievement for such a short tour. We were in town on business and knowing what the families of our colleagues have lived through and how this must have shaped their lives was very humbling. Points to note - I would have no problem bringing children here, however due to the nature of the building (excavated cave network) I wouldn't bring strollers and those with mobility difficulties, especially wheelchair users, may struggle. It would be worth calling ahead as the staff do speak very good English."

The hospital has a varied and interesting history and was heavily involved in WW2, the siege of Budapast, when Nazis were trying to hold the river crossing against advancing Russians, the cold war, including 1956 uprising. There are many waxworks in situ which bring the original instruments, furniture and equipment to life today from what was a relatively short time ago.Its existence was a state secret until as recently as 2002!

Tour begins with a short video to give a historical context and general overview and then continues with a guided tour of the facility which is tens of meters underground. You can't walk around freely but the tour covers most of the important rooms. Theres a discount for students, medical personnel, teachers etc. so be sure to ask for one.

Wax figures everywhere and replicas of hospital scenes during WW II, really touching and sad experience. :( Guide lady was talkative and her stories were educative but only one thing bothered me: sound of siren at the end of the tour. One of the visitors was allowed to activate it so it reverberated in such a small space so that we all had to plug our ears. It was really anxious moment for me but luckily it happened at the end of the tour. I recommend this hospital to everyone except small children because at times it can be a little bit scary for them, all that blood, wounds, unconscious wax people, gas masks, medical needles etc."

It is well worth visiting this hospital which is an eye opener and a reminder of wartime conditions, in this case both from 1944/45 and the siege of 1956. The tour, which lasts just under an hour, takes you round the wards, operating theatres etc as they were at this time with displays such as the bandages used, which went out of date in 1961! Several waxwork figures of doctors, nurses, patients are in place which gives a very good feel for how things must have been. The end of the tour takes you through the nuclear bunker as well. The visits are all with a guide - we were the only two English speakers when we arrived and we were taken around separately with a guide who spoke excellent English."

You can only visit the labyrinth of rooms as part of a guided tour and our English speaking tour guide made it an enjoyable visit.

Wax figures and mock-operation scenes give a real feel for what it must have been like, working and surviving, in very difficult and trying circumstances. Some of the scenes are quite bloody and graphic and may be unsuitable for young children. You are not allowed to take photos in the museum, but a group photo is taken by the tour guide and posted to their website as a reminder of your visit."

Tour is preceded by a short video. They have woolen capes that you can borrow to keep warm while you tour the cave which is quite cool. The purpose of the bunker is explained well and the displays are interesting. There are new rooms/exhibits since I was there 2 years ago, which was a nice surprise. My 14 yr old son thought the hospital in the rock was really cool and enjoyed our visit.It's easiest to find the hospital in the rock from Castle Hill. When you're standing in front of St Mathias church take the road to your left which will lead to a long covered stairway. At the bottom of the stairs go right and the hospital will be on your right. If you are using public transportation you can reverse the above directions and catch a bus from Castle Hill or go right when you leave the Hospital in the Rock and about a block or so later on the left there is a huge staircase going down. It's not marked, you just need to look for it. At the end of the many stairs, go through the park, taking the fork to the right and head for what looks like a parking garage. The metro stop Deli Paulyaudvar is there."

Due to the chilly temperature in the underground setting, everyone is urged to wear a green loden coat/ cape , available from a rack at the entryway. Everyone winds through the tunnels and pathways which include rooms for surgery and medical equipment, as well as a nuclear bunker. The guide was very informative in describing the hospital's work and offered background on wartime Budapest. This was a good change of pace after viewing many castle interiors!"

It is a war hospital under the ground and you can see a nuclear bunker. Has been restored very well, you cannot walk around freely but our guide Fruszi was informative and it was a worthwhile tour.Really recommend you go, entrance is 3600 HUF each (\u00a39) or discounted if you have any ID to prove you are medical or armed forces personnel."

We hadn't realised that tours left on the hour, and having arrived at 6.10pm we thought we might have to wait another 50 mins but we were told we have only missed the introductory video that we could catch up on at the end so that was great. We didn't have any of the problems that other reviewers have mentioned about tour sizes - we were 6 on an English speaking tour and had lots of space! I would say the tour guide hurried us a bit but there was a lot to see and he was extremely knowledgable! A piece of history that is worth visiting. Wasn't sure about the sale of actual items from Hospital and Czech gas masks in the shop.http://www.sziklakorhaz.eu/en"

The Hospital in the Rock is a really interesting place though, in my opinion, quite expensive by Hungarian standards and, as such, I expected better. Unfortunately you're not allowed to roam freely through the system of tunnels and instead you have to join a tour - when I visited there were two tours running at the same time (one after the other) with one led by an English speaking guide and one Hungarian. There were at least 20 people on the English speaking tour that I joined at 3pm on a weekday afternoon and only a handful on the Hungarian tour. In hindsight, I wish I'd just joined the Hungarian tour as with so many people in our group, it was a struggle to see a lot of the rooms (most of the areas are very small so not many people can reasonably fit in) and I could barely hear our guide - when I could hear her I really struggled to understand what she was saying as, though she tried to speak clearly and make herself heard, her English was pretty poor. It didn't help that lots of people in the group were talking over the guide in their own languages. I feel strongly that numbers on the tours should be capped at 10-15 people as I'm sure that if I'd actually been able to see more of the hospital and hear what the guide was telling us, I'd have enjoyed it a lot more."

I'll explain my issues with it, as you may be able to avoid the things that bothered me to better enjoy yourself.The intro video is actually really well done and informative. It gives you a lot of background into what you are about to see, and I feel like it sets it up to where you need very little additional information. After the video (spoken in Hungarian with English subtitles), they break everyone into two groups - a Hungarian tour and an English tour.I strongly believe they should get a count for each tour BEFORE you break into the groups. We had 19 people on our English tour. There was one family of 5 on the Hungarian tour. I have no problem with the division of languages being done this way and am grateful an English tour is offered, but I really think there should be a max of 15 people per language tour.I am not a pushy person, so, while I started toward the middle of the group, I quickly was pushed to the back of the group. Because you are in a cave system with small rooms, I'd often not get to see anything until the group was moving to the next room. By the time I got to see anything, the tour guide had usually already started explaining about the next room. So I consistently missed explanation and sometimes couldn't fit in the room at all until another person left.Another thing impacting my enjoyment was that not everyone on the English speaking tour spoke English and spoke over the guide. I had an Italian couple next to me, and the gentleman was constantly translating for the female. So not only did I start off by missing what the guide was saying due to the size of the group, but I also missed part of what she was saying because of chatter within the group (much more likely to happen in large groups).Had I known this going in, I would have just joined the Hungarian group of five people. I wouldn't have understood anything the guide said, but I think I would have enjoyed this tour a considerable amount more had I been given time and space to look around. The video established the scene before we went on the tour. I honestly don't feel like I heard the tour guide provide any information that added to my understanding of what I was seeing. For me personally, the size of the group detracted from my enjoyment more than the tour guide added to the enjoyment. I think you will get more from this tour seeing more than hearing more.I also think they should send the smaller tour in first. The group of five was always directly behind me, so I always felt rushed whenever I finally got to see something. It naturally takes 5 people less time to see something than it takes 19 people to see something. But the Hospital in the Rock is really a neat and fascinating experience. I just would have really really enjoyed it more if they capped the group size at 15."

I took the local bus over the river to Buda and so i didn't have to walk up the steep hill to get unto to the castle area. The hospital is located behind the castle complex and is quite hard to find in my opinion. Although once you're on the the road 'Lovas Ut', the crowd of people surrounding a wall is the give away of its location.In any case, it's a wonderful bit of Hungary's history and well worth visiting. Was a working hospital that was used during the second world war, and also during Russia's occupation of Hungary during the revolution. Pretty self explanatory, its a hospital with a cave system. Lots of rooms, lots of wax figures to show what it would have been like and a nuclear bunker. Bring ID if you're a medical student/doctor/nurse/teacher as you will get discount on entry which is handy.

            "review": "One of the best attractions in the world. This was one of my favourite visits to a museum of all time, mainly because it didn't feel like a museum at all. The natural cave systems under the Castle Hill area in Buda were utilised to create a system of rooms and caverns that were converted into a First Aid post. This later became a small military hospital for use during the air raids of WWII, and was later briefly used during the rebellion of Budapest against the Soviets. During the Cold War, this labyrinth of caves was further converted to become a nuclear bunker, still to be used as a hospital, but with all of the appropriate equipment to treat people after a possible nuclear attack on the city.The hospital itself still contains much of the original equipment that would have been used down there, some dating back all the way to the 30s. Some highlights are things like xray machines from the 1950s, and operating tables that were actually used in the hospital. Each room is set up with wax figures to depict how equipment would have been used, who would have been using it and how many people there would have been down there. The sheer amount of equipment and things is incredible, and there is far more than you can see and take in during a 1 hour tour.The only way to see the museum is with a 1 hour guided tour, offered on the hour every hour during the opening times. Two tours leave within 5 minutes of each other, one in English and one in Hungarian. I took the 11am tour on a Sunday, and there were about 15 people in my group. Be sure to stick closely together, as the man following me was slow, and ended up not following me and the rest of the group around a corner, resulting in everyone behind me getting 'lost'. One American guy in the group was heard to exclaim \"We're gonna be stuck in here forever!\", and honestly, it is a labyrinth. It's also worth noting that this place is definitely not wheelchair friendly, as there are stairs in numerous places and narrow corridors. Because of this, please also consider how appropriate it is for you to visit an enclosed and sometimes small space - there is no 'fresh' air, only the air that the ventilation system pumps in once a day, and there are obviously no windows as you are deep underground. Anyone with issues of claustrophobia should probably not visit - I have never suffered fro claustrophobia but by the end of the tour even I was feeling a little uneasy.However, all safety considerations aside, this is an amazing attraction and should definitely be visited by anyone who comes to Budapest!"

There are several ways to see the cave labrinth structure under the Castle hill of the Buda area, but I think this is one of the best ones I recommend. There are few others including dracula themes ones, but that is a bit contrived and not as realistic as this one.This is viewed by tour only, English tour going on every hour and lasts little over an hour. There's a movie about Budapest and the war and the hospital. This was used as the bunker hospital for several occasions. You can see the various rooms (staged with was figures, but with real equipments of old) and learn the history. Just walk down the steps from the Buda Castle..."

The tour starts promptly with no waiting for you if you need to go to the loo beforehand \u2013 so be quick ! It\u2019s fascinating to see the use that this labyrinth of caves, hewn into the hillside, were put to during the war. And you get an inkling of what it must have been like to have been based there. The hospital ward with the wall of silver medical kits looks more like an art installation.The thing that we found disconcerting, and hard to empathise with, is that the display mannequins are dressed as Nazis and the tour guide talks about them as the \u201cgood guys\u201d. Now I realise Hungary had a different experience to many western European countries during WWII, with regard to the Communist forces, but it\u2019s very perturbing to hear history from this point of view.That aside, the caves and their history are interesting and worth spending an hour in. If you carry on down the hillside when you come out you\u2019ll find a couple of good restaurants and you can either get a bus back across the bridge to Pest or take the lift back up to the Castle & National Gallery."

I even bought a 1940 original gas mask for 1500HUF, which is usually selling for 4000HUF just in central castle district.

The place is really well done and contains tons of old medical equipment and machinery. Photos show that the wards appear almost as they were and the place really does have a fascinating history. For me, the wax figures added an unnecessary element of cheesiness. The place has a cool enough history and enough original artifacts to stand on it's own without the figures, but I guess it may add something for other visitors. Otherwise this is a completely unique site and an experience I highly recommend."

Despite some signs pointing it out, it took some effort to find the place. After coming down (from Matthias Church and Fisherman's Bastion area) close to toilets, make sure you just keep going towards bars (barriers) and you will find it soon on the right. This place connects some dark history of Budapest from war times (hospital) and communist times (nuclear bunker) with quite entertaining content. The rooms are nicely packed with figures and equipment to give you the idea how things looked there once. The guide is informative and interesting, but somehow, like others mentioned in previous revies, seems a bit rushed like everything had to be packed in that one hour tour. I don't like too much talking either but extra 15 minutes or so wouldn't do much harm. The real shame and disappointment though is for not being able to make pictures. Why is it such a big deal? Anyway, strongly recommending this one to everyone. Surely not to be missed!"

The hospital areas are historically, very interesting and as a nurse I was particularly keen in seeing the hospital rooms and experiencing the atmosphere, but alas, no time to absorb or read the information that is provided. I was not that interested in the mechanics of how the hospital operated, i.e. Ventilation shafts etc. The guide was very knowledgeable and knew his stuff. The tour needs to be longer and less hurried. If you are a nurse or doctor you get reduced entry. So take your ID with you if you intend to visit this historical hospital museum."

I say speedy but it was probably an hour long - which is not enough time to read all the information on the walls.This underground cave network was transformed into a WWII hospital and then into a cold-war bunker. There are many waxwork models carefully placed to set the scene for you. The guide was very good and involved the small group in the discussion about what went on.I felt it well worth the time and money - but note that the tours leave on the hour so time your arrival carefully so you are not hanging around in the entrance."

My partner and I visited this museum and were told that tours are every hour on the hour. As it was 5 minutes to 4, we bought tickets for the 4pm tour which was in English. Once we had paid, we were told that the tour started with a 10 minute video, but the room was full so we would have to wait and watch it at the end. We were told someone would get us when the tour started...After 10 minutes, a woman who I think was the manager came over and asked us whether we were booked on the tour; when we said yes she said \"my colleague must have forgotten to get you\"...it turned out they had started the tour without us. She rushed us down the corridor past the first 3 rooms with a very brief description (no time to look inside) and we were told to make sure we stayed with the group. We were at the end of the tour group, which meant we couldn't hear what the tour guide was saying because the Hungarian tour was taking place 2 paces behind us and we couldn't make out the English over the Hungarian. After about 10 minutes the 2 groups split so we could at least hear what was being said. This museum has a lot to show and there are information boards throughout the corridors and rooms. However, you are not given chance to look at everything on show because they are under time constraints to get everyone through the tour in an hour. The information I did get was very interesting, I just wish we had been given more time to look at everything!At the end, I explained to the tour guide that we had missed the video so she sat us in with the next group. The video room is relatively small with a number of chairs set out. The video is in Hungarian with English subtitles which are very low down so unless you are on the front row they are near-impossible to read. I was really disappointed with this museum as I had read such great reviews. I didn't think it was worth the money (and we even got a discount for being EU citizens under 26) - there are much better museums in Budapest."

It was a little bit hard to find the entrance, so you may want to take a good look at a map, and keep an eye on the signs. The building is facinating.There is a small gift shop which sells items which were stocked in the hosptial/bunker years ago. These are very reasonably priced and somewhat unusual (eg bags, gas masks, canvas stretcher).The tour guides have a lively spirit about them, and spoke very enthusiastically.The guided tours are hourly, so if you find you have just missed a tour just walk up to the castle area and wonder around the streets or pop into one of the lovely coffee shops.It is a bit chilly in the building, so if you think you will be cold they will loan you a fleece. These all looked smart and clean - but I did not need one.I think some people might worry that it would be claustrophobic, but I did not feel this way at all. The rooms are well lit, and well ventilated, and of reasonable size. I guess you could look at some photos to guage your own personal view."

The hospital is very unusual as all the equipment and medicine is original from WW2 and later the Cold War of the 50's when it became a Nuclear bunker.

The signage could do with some improvement (the museum is down some steps just below the Castle Hill walls), and tours run once an hour on the hour which is worth remembering as there's more than enough to take up your time within Castle Hill. The guided tour through the cave hospital complex is very informative; combining medical and military history to provide an unusual insight into Budapest's past. The exhibit content ranges from the 1930s to the Cold War and is well explained by the friendly guides. The atmosphere and conditions of the hospital throughout its history is brought to life not only through the colourful descriptions of the tour guide but the abundance of original material and the quirky wax figures used to occasionally unsettling effect to recreate scenes of hospital life. Following the tour the gift shop had a remarkable range of original military artefacts. I was delighted to pick up an authentic 1960s gas mask for only 1000FT - far superior to the usual pen or key ring offered in most museum gift shops! I would thoroughly recommend this museum to any visitors to the Castle Hill District."

What you get here is a time capsule style preservation tour with wax work dolls of how the hospital has been used over the past 70 or so years, however, it does lack narrative and sometimes context for the hospitals place in the story of the city and its place in Budapest's history. I'd have liked more in-depth information on the rooms and exhibits on display, instead you are hurried by with little or no info about the exhibits and prohibited from taking photographs.There were quite a few young children on the tours (primary school) who were complaining of being frightened and clinging to their parents in the caves, the mashed up faces of the waxworks dolls would be enough to scare most kids forget the content, asking the children to wind up nuclear war sirens and let them blast out was also quite cringey. I wouldn't recommend taking your young children here.This real, once working exhibit could be awesome but the thin content and rushed tour let it down, it has the potential to be the best recent history tour in Budapest... but needs a rethink."

Our tour guide was great, very informative, a bit humorous and spoke on some of the less commonly discussed facts from Hungarys history. His English was good - there were alot of medical and nuclear instruments in the bunker and he took the time to learn the English names for them which we thought was stellarUnderneath the rock itself is a bit of a time warp, the life size dolls are realistically depicting what it was like down there whilst the hospital was in use, there's stacks of old equipment to look at - medical, nuclear and historical war time.. plus I just find the whole building structure and the way it was designed very interesting :) plus, there's the opportunity to wind up one of cthe old bomb sirens at the end - as you can imagine loud but couldn't resist! very well worth it and highly recommended."

The tour is a little bit long, but they work with guided tours, which really helps to understand the place and all of its history. You get to go inside this hospital/bunker and I even got to manage a manual air raid sirene. Suggest taking a whole day to wonder the castle hill area and find some time to go here. Find out the time of the guided tours so you wont waste your time."

Located in an extended underground area beneath the Castle District in Budapest, Hospital in the Rock is the site of a large medical facility that was used by a number of different groups during the more recent past in Budapest's often difficult history. The exhibits are well done, and the area is that which was actually utilized. Guides take the visitors through the corridors and one gets a feeling as to what is was like to be a patient or a medical worker during the war or a civil servant preparing for a possible nuclear attack and ready to test radiation levels on the surface above. This relatively small attraction is not to be missed."

The tour was very organized, and the wax figures made the operating rooms and other displays more realistic. Our guide was well informed and spoke excellent English. Unfortunately, no photos were allowed during the tour, and the small guide book at the gift shop did not show the interior of the hospital/nuke shelter sufficiently. I did manage to grab a couple of pics at the end of the tour of the Communist era ambulance.The gift shop has some really neat stuff for collectors.

There is a actually a hospital and nuclear bomb shelter underneath Buda and the tour not only shows you what it was set up to do but they include \"people\" in the tableau so you get a real sense of how this facility was used. It was mostly used during WWII for a relatively short period of time but the history is very interesting and then to see the bomb shelter and hear the story of how this was intended to be used (!) was eye opening. If you are looking for another slice of life in Budapest I would recommend this tour."

It also means the hour-long tours can run quickly and efficiently, without being held up by photographers.If you're interested in healthcare, and how things have changed in what is really a relatively short period of time, make sure you check out Hospital in the Rock."

It is similar to the Churchhill War Rooms in London, just as interesting but more casual and loose. The staff is younger, knowledgeable and multilingual. This is a newer attraction and may not show up on some of the guides. Great location, but a little hard to find. Head to west or Buda Hills side of Castle Hill. You go down a flight of stairs to a ring road which you follow left around the hill. I guess a hospital/command and control bunker built in the side of mountain is difficult to find by design. They offer military discounts if you have your identification card. The gift shop sells basic Soviet/Eastern Bloc military gear that was stored in the complex. Only negative was that we were the last tour of the day and we had twice the number of people in our group than was ideal."

Pictures are not allowed but the guide will take a group picture at the end of the tour.The entrance is a little expensive, 3600 ft for adults, but I think that in the 28-th of each month, the last tour from 19 o'clock costs 1800 ft. I visited the hospital on the 28th of August, at 19 o'clock and I paid half the price and I also got a discount ticket for the Spy Museum."

It's awesome for docs, nurses, hospital staff, or physics/radation specialties. It gets a little chilly (about 55-60*F) and you're down there for an hour long tour, so I would bring a light sweater if you get chilled easily.

You have to listen carefully as the dialogue could get lost in a larger group. It is a wax museum but there is a lot to see apart from the hospital figures themselves. Imagine is a must, there are all the mechanics of the tunnels, air purification, lighting, safety features, fuel storage . Just imagine yourself having to endure a stay in there, under occupation, surrounded by smokers and sick people. I would definitely recommend a visit here."

The cashier was very friendly and she informed me about the different kinds of discounts (even if there was a chart just next to her). Make sure you bring your national professional ID if you're an EU teacher or you work in health care as there are discounts (free for teachers!).I was the only Hungarian in the group, and the guides asked me three times if I was sure about not wanting a Hungarian guide. I found this very professional, as they could have just ignored me (especially because - being a teacher- I did not pay a single forint .)First, we saw a short (6-7 mins) film about the history of the hospital. Then we were led to the cave system underground. They provide you with coats as the caves are a bit cold. (I liked the idea that they used special coats still worn by nurses and doctors in some hospitals in cold weather.)The guide, Gerda was very informative and told us lots of interesting little stories. I was very well informed on the tour, but it still was't too much, just the right amount of information. The hospital was a very unique experience with its 1 km underground system. I saw different treatment rooms, an operation theatre, kitchen, wards and the machinery rooms. As the hospital used to be a top secret location, the stories about disguising functions of the hospital are fascinating.Yes, some visitors did sound the siren, but we were asked before if there was anybody who did not want to hear it. The tour guide took a photo of the visitors which can be seen on their website.The only downside was that the tour was a bit rushed, I wanted to read the posters, but there was no time."

The 1st is about the hospital it self, the second is about the machineries of the hospital. You can choose to leave in the second session or continue the tour. But the price is same. You cannot take photos in this place. The down side about this place is in some rooms are stink, i don't now if others notice it or not.

It is unfortunate that the tour is somewhat imbalanced and manipulative. From the get go, our tour guide brushed aside Hungary's alliance with Hitler, by saying something like, \"you all know the history, we went with Germany in the war\" as if they were on a date! You see neat medical stuff. But also be prepared to see Nazi collaborators who used the underground space for strategic purposes. For some reason, the tour included a representation of Hungary's military assisting the US in Afghanistan in 2011. Presumably this was included in the tour to assuage any hard feelings still lingering by American tourists. The hospital is cool. But the guide stays on script and is fairly repetitive. I give it two thumbs way down."

Even the part where they have to use bandages taken from dead bodies - he found it fascinating and carried on looking up for more information from the internet when we get home.There's a lot of interesting old instruments, medical equipment and antiquated but working machines inside the cave, but the dummies and mannequins are disappointingly hilarious. They looked like they're from 80s horror B-movies special effects department. Don't this put you off from visiting this place because it was such full-on assault from what old medical and nursing practises in the past and how we've moved on in both fields. It's astonishing to learn that some practises are still the same as today and some are really medieval you won't think it'll have a place in today's clinical practices.Highly recommended for everyone.

As other people have mentioned, we had a bit of trouble finding the place to start with (it's on the lower road) but it's well worth persevering. There's a tour in English every hour, and when we went, it was free - I think because we're part of the EU perhaps. It's a shame in some way though, because they really do a fantastic job with the place, and it'd completely justify a fee of some sort. We ended up buying one of the metal medical cases at the end of the tour instead. The tour guide was a lovely girl who really knew her stuff, spoke excellent English, and was very enthusiastic. The displays are really well done, and it gives you a strange feeling to walk through the corridors and see them all, since I believe they're recreated the way they were when the place was in operation. At the start of the tour they tell you to take a coat from the rack if you're susceptible to the cold, and it DOES get cold, even though it was 34 degrees outside when we went. Informative, interesting, and captures the imagination spectacularly, this was one of my absolute favourite parts of my trip to Budapest, a definite recommendation."

Our tour guide, Milan, was very entertaining as he whisked us through the complex fairly rapidly, and was clearly passionate about the history he was explaining. Oh yes!

You see real beds, instruments, and places, and another part of it was a bunker during the Cold War, so you can see the communications, tracking and purification devices in case of a nuclear attack.They offer you coats as you go in, since it's quite cool inside, but if you go in the summer you'll be thankful for the coolness, don't bother with the coats :)"

The best way to find this is to follow the sign posts in the Castle area. Once found it was well worth it though!It cost about \u00a310 per ticket which we found expensive however if you are military, a teacher or a DR bring ID and you get a big discount. The only way to view the hospital/bunker is by tour which runs every hour however if you arrive and one has started you can buy a ticket and come back later for the next.Our tour guide spoke excellent English and was able to answer all questions. There was a moderate about of walking but nothing strenuous. The hospital is cold so bring a jumper or you can borrow a coat from the museum. If you have an interest in communism or WWII history then this helps paint a picture of Hungary\u2019s association with both.This was an interesting tour of both hospital and nuclear bunker which made for an interesting alternative to other Budapest attractions. The gift shop is also worth a look for cheap memorabilia of real items found on the hospital."

It was amazingly cool in the mountain, which was appreciated being that it was really hot. I was disappointed when I found out that we could only go in if we signed up for a tour. I was under the impression that we were going on an English tour. However when we caught up with the group (we came into the tour 5 min after it started) the tour guide was speaking hungarian. I believe the tour took twice as long because he had to do his guide in two languages. I became very annoyed at this point. The tour guide himself was very nice and polite. It just wasn't my kind of tour. I will say though that the wax figures they had to represent the doctors and soldiers were very disturbing. If you are interested in Nuclear Bomb shelters this tour is for you! :D"

As a nurse working in modern day it really gives me great admiration for the work of the medical staff during WWII and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. well worth a visit."

We didn't know much to start with, and we felt a lot more knowledgeable after we left. The tour is just over an hour long, but the time goes by very quickly! The hospital has a lot of original objects in it, which makes it even more interesting. You really get a feel for the history of the place and the tour guide was brilliant. Definitely go!

The museum is a system of interconnected underground caves which were utilized to host a wartime hospital that was fully operational during bombings and siege of Budapest. Later, in the communist era, it was transformed into a nuclear-proof shelter. I would say it is very atmospheric, making you think of atrocities of the war and bravery of doctors who managed to save lives under appalling conditions.The entrance ticket is not cheap, but you can get a discount if you are a doctor/nurse, and have a document certifying this."

And I wasn't let down. In fact, this place exceeded my expectations!To get there: I took the Funicular up to the Castle (or you can walk), walk straight over to the back, and then to the right hand side where the road goes underneath a bridge connecting to the Castle. Stay on the bridge over the road, don't take the steps immediately heading down on the left hand side after the bridge. Walk along this road (Uri Utca) which has lovely high rise views over Buda. You come to a covered staircase down to Lovas ut. At the bottom of the stairs, turn right and the entrance is right there.It's 3600 HUF to get in. About \u00a310. They said the tour would take 75 minutes. (tours depart on the hour every hour, last tour at 7pm). Can only visit by tour guide. My 6pm group was about 35-40 people large. Quite big. My tour took about 95 mins.They start the tour by showing a brief video about the history. Then you have a tour of the whole complex. They have opened the museum with genuine artifacts from the 1950s and wax works which makes it very realistic to appreciate the conditions they worked in during the war. They show you the engine room, as well as operating theatres, wards, kitchen. No photos allowed inside.Honestly, it is a must see!"

It was also used by the Germans and Russians. Of all the bunkers I've seen recently in Central Europe, this one was easily the most impressive. The air filtration, water storage and filtration and power generation systems were before their time.We arrived 10 minutes after a tour had already started so an attendant gave us a quick yet efficient briefing, enabling us to join the previous tour. The guide delivered his presentation in Hungarian and perfect English. We didn't feel that it was rushed; there was plenty of time to look at the exhibits.It makes perfect sense that visitors can ONLY see the bunker with a guide. There is so much original equipment, medical supplies and historic items. The rooms are a bit of a maze. It could be dangerous or confusing for people to wander about on their own. The air filtration system is still operational and the management of the bunker would not like anyone tinkering with the machines!From Matthias Church, walk away from the Fisherman's Bastion along Szenth\u00e1roms\u00e1g Street (past Cafe Ruszwurm).

The hospital would be a far better experience if people were allowed to walk around by themselves and read placards (if they were provided) because the historical notoriety of this attraction speaks for itself having aided victims during nazi occupation and communist rule and being hidden away to provide safety from the shelling, however having to be confined in a group with a guide with broken English took from the experience as did the inability to take pictures, should be allowed to take pictures if you pay to get into something."

This is a museum located in the very old tunnels under the castle district in which a secret hospital was built during WW2 and later also a nuclear bomb shelter. It's very authentic with a lot of the original equipment still there and life size dolls showing how it was used. Only guided tours (about 1h). No photography allowed, but you get to sound the alarm bell! They sell cheap WW2 gasmasks (4?) and stuff in the souvenir shop."

Fascinating museum set into the rock and the tour starts with a short film in Hungarian with English subtitles followed by a tour of the labyrinthine tunnels and wards of the former hospital. Several times the guide chided anyone not keeping up and there were lots of photos and information boards but not really enough time to take it all in as we were rushed onto the next part. The most moving part was the large ward with models lying in bed - a hush descended over the group as we all reflected on the horror that must been experienced but almost on cue we were summoned to the next room and the moment was lost.There was a lot of information to take in and my regret was not having time to read all the information boards - those I did manage were excellent. Before the hour was up we were in the shop and the guide was spiriting away another group.This has the potential to be a five star attraction if only they would invest in another giude and make the tours 10-15 minutes longer. The tunnels are large enough to take 2 groups at different stages of their tours.Still worth doing this but they are missing a trick marching folk around so quickly and then berating them if they hold back to read the information!"

The Hospital in the Rock is a bit of a walk from the castle complex, but well work the effort to get there and time you invest in the tour.The tour is 80 minutes long and starts about every hour. The facilities have been wonderfully restored/maintained. The tour starts with a quick video intro to the hospital and then continues with a guided tour of the hospital (typically in Hungarian and English). Most of the rooms include mannequins that show scenes from the hospital's past from WWII through 2002.The gift shop offers some very unique souvenirs including gas masks, stretchers, and first aid boxes as well as traditional ones like t-shirts."

However, there were two tours running at the same time, a Hungarian and an English language tour, so we had to wait for translation at each point of the tour. There were an number of interesting facts and stories about the hospital, but I found the tour of the nuclear bunker much more interesting. The highlight of the tour was the fact that we got to sound an air-raid alarm at the end of the tour. The tour of the hospital lasts about one hour, and the tour nuclear bunker lasts about 20 minutes. There are a number of discounts available but I was unable to avail of any of them, so I paid the full admission price of \u20ac20. I felt this was a little expensive for what it was."

Reason for it being a tour is the way the attraction is structured. To make it more authentic they have left as much of it as it would have been during its operation which means it really comes to life, however it also means there is lots of things that can be touched, pressed etc so a guide is essential to ensure the continued authenticity."

The tour takes an hour, with a guide included in the price. You are shown wards, operating theatres and other related hospital exhibits. There is then various German military displays, with a helicopter rebuilt in one if the old wards.It is an amazing place when you consider it is cut out of the rock, but I wasn't too keen on the wax works models recreating how it would have been. I'm sure it is the only way they can really show how cramped and unhygienic it would have been, but wax models don't do it for me (I never liked Madame Tussaud's either).I thought at 3600 huf (\u00a311 ish) it was a bit expensive for one hour, but the equivalent in the UK would be more I suppose. The tours are on the hour and if you are in the Armed Services, medical, police or teacher then take your ID as you will get a decent discount.Not bad, but not great value for money!"

The sheer volume of work that must have gone into making these undergound galleries is breathtaking. You would be excused for missing it though, as the signage is not the best; the easiest is to take a straight line from the main entrance of St Matthias church, towards the city walls. Then take the stairs, at the end turn right, and fifty meters later, you're there, below the Castle's wall.The entrance is unassuming, but the staff welcome makes up for it. You're not allowed to take pictures or film during the visit, which starts with a nine minute movie, essentialy a patchwork of disparate facts and does not give one a clear timeline of how the hospital came about.Still, the guide then takes over and...the visit comes alive. Ease in English, good explanations of the museum which in itself is a valiant effort to show a side of Hungarian history which is lesser known to foreigners. The special forces exhibit is pointless and only reinforces the notion of patchwork, yet the guide found the right words in making a slight link with the work of the hospital.All in all, not bad, if not slightly expensive (3,600 ft per adult - 13 euro)."

We payed for the tour and waited for the start I was surprised there were do many people on the tour. As part of the price you pay for the guide as well so you don't get lost in the cave system! Our guide spoke perfect English all her info was very interesting. I loved the tour we wer transported from WWII to 1956 to the Cold War and back again. It was great seeing all the old hospital equipment and kitchens and how the ran through such adversity personally it was interesting for me as I work in a hospital! The nuclear bunker aspect if the tour was interesting too it was fun to see how it was kept operational with all the tricks above ground. The only downside was that there were so many people by the time we got to look at something the guide was giving info on the next part. Other than that it was great."

This hospital in the rock is basically a set of natural caves that were expanded by man. It was used during World War II and continuously (in secrecy) up until the 60s.Interestingly, this particular tourist attraction is quite different and unique than any other in the world. Not only was it a hospital hidden underneath Buda Castle but it was also a nuclear bunker and \"top-secret\" until the end of the Cold War.One story I found interesting is that the keepers of the facility needed tons of diesel fuel to keep the place running in case of a nuclear attack. What they did was install a pipe outside above this hospital that ran along a bed of flowers. For 40 years, a \"flowering truck\" would come around and water the flowers and provide diesel fuel into the pipes. It is my understanding that nobody found out about this.This place is certainly quite unique and worth a visit if you have the time. The tour is about 1 1/2 hours and you must follow a tour guide. It is quite comprehensive and leads you through a series of tunnels which displays several areas of the \"hospital\" and nuclear bunker. The tour guide explains how the work day and how it still operates with a unique air filtration system.All in all, I was extremely impressed with this attraction and would recommend it to anyone who is in the medical field or interested in a very cool piece of history. If you work as a medical doctor, paramedic, police officer or in the medical field ask for a discount which is pretty substantial."

There were 2 Hungarians (in a group of about 20) so the guide did the tour in both English and Hungarian.

They were kind enough to admit our family at the family price even though our children are above the age of 18 -- but more on that in a minute. The sheer spectacle of the caves and equipment within is definitely memorable and worth seeing. It looks like they are setting up for additional video presentations within the cave, which would be very useful, as the introductory video shown is interesting.But... there's the cost. At 3600 Ft (~US$16) per adult (7200 Ft for a family of 4), that's just a lot of money when compared to many other attractions in Budapest. Our tour had roughly 40 people on it, which is a bit unwieldy as well. Perhaps the video monitors will enable this to be a bit more self-service.Glad to have seen it, but while we have repeated visits with guests to many other attractions, the cost and our \"just OK\" reaction to this one means we'll not repeat it ourselves, and it would be one of the first things I'd jettison from an overcrowded itinerary."

Our guide was really excellent, and seemed genuinely interested and enthusiastic about the displays and information she was telling us, even although she must have given the same talk many times before.

While I understand that they wanted to illustrate for you what some of the spaces were used for, the mannequins and medical equipment displays were somewhat laughable after a few rooms.

They certainly won't win any awards for the best wax work dummies but this didn't detract from the story that they told. Despite the fact that the hospital was only used briefly in WWII and the 1956 uprising, the history that you learn on the way round is a much broader picture of Hungary\u2019s past.

The tour took about an hour and a half and was given by an entertaining tour guide who spoke both Hungarian and English.

You see the original equipment, along with dummies dressed up as doctors, nurses, and patients in a variety of poses and positions -- some of which are quite graphic.The history of the hospital, how it was used, and the mechanisms that they had in place to deal with a potential nuclear attack were all of great interest, and were explained clearly by a guide who spoke fluent English.One amusing point is that you're not allowed to take pictures, because the facility is still owned and run by the Hungarian military."

While most of the individual items in here aren't overly impressive, as you walk through this hospital, you get a good appreciation for the history and though processes behind it. I personally wasn't overwhelmed but admittedly don't appreciate history like I should. However, I recognize it's something unique that you won't really see other places, so if you have the time and are a history buff at all, I would recommend this, especially if you are under 26, a student, teacher, or in the medical field (admission discount)."

It is a former hospital established inside naturally occurring caves, converted into a nuclear bunker during the Cold War, and now a historic attraction. There are waxworks which bring the museum to life, and because the history is relatively recent, many of the artefacts are real rather than replicas. Our tour guide gave just the right amount of information - and it is interesting to hear the history from a different perspective, rather than it being purely a political history.

The engineering involved to first provide a basic 'bomb-proof' hospital in time of conflict & extreme turmoil, & later a nuclear blast proof shelter, is well.....utterly astounding! The vast tunnels challenge engineering principles to provide fresh air & provisions. I won't say too much as it may spoil the overall experience for those wishing to visit but if you see any pictures of the old Budapest during the 2nd World War, with all the bridges bombed in & all the houses & building left standing as 'shells', it really gives a sense of perspective of why extreme measures were taken to provide a safe haven to administer first aid & hospitalization of injured citizens & troops.If you like historic tourism I would like to think you'd appreciate this.If you work in the medical profession they do offer discount at the attraction with proof of occupation."

With this in mind we very much enjoyed a visit to this intriguing attraction. There was a delay in the tour starting but the wait was well worth it as the 1 hour tour in Hungarian & English was fascinating. It covered its history with its first role as a first-aid station, then a hospital during WWII and finally a nuclear bunker under the communists which was actually maintained in readiness till 2000, beyond the fall of communism. It was equipped with the most modern medical equipment of the time. The operating theatres contain x-ray and anaesthetic machines; the only use they ever got was on the sets of the1990s film \u2018Evita\u2019 ! The bunker was shrouded in complete secrecy, the populace being told the area had closed. This meant that e.g. water and oil had to be channelled from a local flowerbed and the generator & other exhausts being directed through guttering on a house on Uri ut. Housekeepers lived in the bunker till 2000 changing the bed sheets every fortnight. The latter endeavour I think is a good illustration of the kind of fallacy that can be inherent in these monumental political systems."

The guide wasn't engaging and given the size of the rooms and the corridors it wasn't always easy to hear her as she was starting explaining while we were in the previous room.There's also a nuclear bunker in the building, but again nothing impressive.I would recommend it only if it was free, 3000 Ft (the sum I paid) is definitely too much."

It was a mixed bag of hungarians and europeans so the guide had to translate everything in hungarian and english, making the whole experience a bit tedious and too long. Moreover since you have to walk in narrow corridors it is really hard to fit 30 people and by the time the guide starts explaining something you might still be in the previous room and end up missing half of the informations. Also i have to say that the guide wasn't engaging at all, she sounded bored, like she didn't really want to be there at all.All in all i really liked the place, even though the horrible tour spoiled the experience considerably."

There was a huge group of people waiting to tour (not incl a school group) and they didn't separate us so we had only 1 guide. She didn't have a microphone or a loud voice so at times it was impossible to hear. Especially because the rooms & hallways are small, the whole group couldn't fit in.

This hospital treated victims during WWII and also served as air raid shelter.. During the 1956 up-rising, it was overfilled with wounded and dying Hungarians. Then it became a secret bomb shelter to survive nuclear winter. Today it has scores of injured wax figures bringing home its message and piles of rations to endure radiation.
