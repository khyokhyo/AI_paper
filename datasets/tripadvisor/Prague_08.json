The Lobkowicz dynasty was unknown to us before. IT was fascinating to hear the history of this noble family. The weapons collection is small, but all pieces are in pristine condition. Wrapping up the visit with a small concert in one of the family rooms was wonderful."

The story of there 600 year history is amazing. The pictures, china, and arms pale in comparison to the family's music connection and the originals of music by Strauss, Hayden and Beethoven. This is a special and unique tour."

The audio tour was great in giving a perspective across many generations of the Lobkowicz' family history, and many great artifacts. Particularly cool were the collection of armor, and the musical instruments and Beethoven manuscript (as we learned, they were benefactors of Beethoven). Worth the visit."

It belongs (again) to the noble Lobkowicz family.Located in the lower part of the Castle, opposite the Golden lane it is excluded from the combined ticket variations offered by Prague Castle.You have to pay an extra admission but it's really worth it. Audio guide is included and it tells an interesting story, familiar to us from the ex Eastern block, about Nazi and after them Communist property nationalization. Inside great artistic artifacts are displayed from Velasquez paintings, over fine chinaware and arms collections to Mozart and Beethoven manuscripts."

The palace is spread out , so there is a lot of walking. We had a guide with us so we did not use the audio guide that is available. The human guide only spoke at length on the highlights and we wondered whether we missed anything by not having the audio guide. It is worth a visit when in the Castle complex."

            "review": "Great Museum. I was surprised by how interesting this was. While we all understand that nobility marries nobility to create and consolidate wealth, to see/hear it about a specific lineage was interesting. The art was great. How many families have had their portraits painted by Velasquez? The 6th Prince was a serious patron of Beethoven and financed premieres of works such as Haydn's The Creation. The covers of several manuscripts, with dedications, are on display as is a list of the expenses for one musical premiere. Perhaps the most magnificent piece is The Hay Harvest by Brueghel the Elder--in a room by itself with helpful information and absolutely nobody else jostling to see it. Admission (if you are over 65 remember to ask for the reduced rate) includes a good audio guide narrated by the current Prince. The story of how the family reclaimed its properties and wealth after confiscations by both the Nazis and Communists is interesting. It felt a bit heavy handed to hear about their other palace that is open to the public and to hear repeatedly about all the donations that have made art restorations possible. These were small matters and didn't ruin a great museum experience. So different from most of the \u201cattractions\u201d in the castle complex."

I was lucky to hear Prince William Lobkowicz speak at a private event about the epic adventure of having centuries of family treasures confiscated and returned twice; first by the Nazis and then the Communists. The dedication and perseverance of his family to make these treasures available to the public is remarkable. The prince and other family members speak on the audio tour, which is punctuated with period music. Spend an hour or so touring the museum, looking at paintings, porcelain, weapons and musical scores (including original Beethoven scores) and then enjoy the hour-long concert in the music hall.There is also a lovely and quiet courtyard restaurant and nice gift shop adjacent to the palace."

            "review": "Fascinating History. This is a combined review of lunch and the tour of the palace. We had lunch in the palace as part of an optional tour associated with our Viking River Cruise. The lunch was fine -- I was glad I chose the vegetable lasagne, because the meat option looked brown and undistinguished with a dumpling that tasted bland (another lady gave me a taste of hers.) We also had salad and dessert. But what was memorable was the palace itself. The Lobkowicz family had this palace from the 16th Century until it was taken from them first by the Nazis and then by the Communists. When the Czech Republic was established, they were given the opportunity to regain their property but had to go through a lot of legal hoops. They also were told to open it to the public. But \"the public\" sees it in small groups, which makes for a more enjoyable experience. A past Prince Lobkowicz gave Beethoven a stipend so he could compose what he chose rather than scrambling for commissions, as did earlier composers such as Mozart. The visit included a concert in a music room where Beethoven had performed. On view in the palace are original scores by Beethoven with his handwritten corrections. The family had a a fabulous art collection--a painting by Velazquez shows the Infanta (King Philip of Spain's daughter.) She married one of the Lobkowicz ancestors, and her mother gave her the statue of the Child Jesus in satin robes that later became known as the Infant of Prague. (Evidently, miracles were attributed to this statue. I just knew it was common in Catholic homes during my childhood.) Visitors are guided through the palace by an audio guide recorded by Lobkowicz family members. The current Prince (I guess you can call him that) Lobkowicz spent his early days in England and married a beautiful Bostonian. The tapes are full of interesting anecdotes. Near the end of the tour, you come to a terrace with a fabulous view of Prague. By the way, if you need to use a rest room on your visit, the one upstairs is much nicer than the one in the basement."

This is a great place for gaining an insight in to the lives and influence on one of the major aristocratic families in Europe. Once you get passed the family portraits there are some great exhibits of porcelain and pictures. The family were also major patrons of the arts and it was thrilling for me to see original manuscripts by Mozart, Haydn, Gluck and Beethoven. If you time your visit just before 13.00hrs there is a daily concert which, if you choose not to attend, will provide quality background music whilst you saunter. The two Canaletto's were absolutely stunning and the panoramic views from the balcony took my breath away."

The History narrated by the Lobkowicz family is so amazing, hearing how the family had lost such treasures twice, and then rightfully returned back after the fall of communism alone is a fascinating story. Then being able to walk through the museum and seeing the various art works, with the continuing narration of the audio tour providing such an in-depth history of the works, and how they related to the family is intertwined perfectly. A great example is the manuscripts by Beethoven, signed to the prince at the time, of who was an incredible patron of the arts. Standing in a room seeing Mozart, Beethoven and Haydn\u2019s own handwriting of musical scores is overwhelming. The museum does offer a Brueghel and Velazquez, amongst many other worthy artists of the time. Along with an entire room devoted to paintings of dogs, armory and plate ware, all of which make the price of admission worth a visitA side visit which did cost an additional amount was to do the panorama / balcony tour. The tour will add on another \u00bd plus to your visit, but is so worth it!!! The Lobkowicz\u2019s provide such a fascinating tale of the sites one can view from an amazing vantage point on the balcony of various places around the city. This was an incredible way to learn and see even if off in the distance other places of interest to visit, and the accompanying narration and musical interludes was an ideal accompaniment to seeing the museum. The view is incredible for taking so many panoramic pictures.You will want to plan on more than an hour, to visit just the museum, and then almost another hour with the panorama tour, both with audio narration is a great way to pass a morning or afternoon and then eat at the caf\u00e9, either in the shade of the courtyard or on the balcony-with an amazing view."

He tells about the family losing their home and belongings to the Nazis and then to the Soviets before having them restored by the Czech government after the fall of the Soviet Union. For us, the highlight of the tour was the Beethoven room. Here, there are original scores of Symphonies 3, 4, 5 and 6. At least two are dedicated to the prince at the time, who was an important patron of Beethoven. There is a nice restaurant in the Palace with a wonderful view. At 1300, they have a short classical concert. We visit every time we are in Prague and never tire of the experience. The collections are enormous and we always see something new."

You can spend your time visiting the museum - the Lobkowicz family unbelievable collection of art, amassed through centuries. The real draw here is the musical collection, original musical scores annotated by Beethoven, Mozart and Haydn. Beethowen dedicated three symphonies to Prince Lobkowicz. There is also an impressive musical instrument, porcelain and gun collection, and of course all the celebrated paintings ...We did the video tour once, it is charmingly narrated by the current heir and owner. Their family story of survival and living in exile is equally interesting.  If you don't have time for the museum, go for the hour long midday chamber music concert performed in a room with beautiful fresco ceiling. Great opportunity to rest your feet and a great value too. Last but not least to be included is the Cafe with fabulous views from the terrace.We have done it all in one visit or just stopped for refreshments on the terrace another time. It was a sure bet on a hot July day...Lobkowicz Palace is one of my favorite places in Prague... For the amazing collection of art, for the amazing story of the Lobkowicz family and for the amazing views ..."

I have been to Prague three previous times, mostly recently 20 years ago, and so the Lobkowicz Palace was still in government hands. No matter how tired you are, don't miss this. It is far superior to the many sights that are overrun with tourists. This was a palace that had long been owned by one of the Czech Republic's most prominent families, but which had been seized by the communists. After the revolution, the family (by then based in the United States) managed to get it back. The story is rather amazing, and the amusing and interesting audio tour (narrated by the owner) is fascinating. One of the most priceless Bruegal paintings in the world is here, but there is so much more. It's a small museum but if you do it right, it should take about 90 minutes --and then save 30 minutes for a nice meal or drink in the cafe."

Best museum I saw in Prague. The music and the armory room were the most impressive for me. They have some original scores of Mozart and of Beethoven's 5th symphony. This last one was dedicated to the 7th Prince Lobkowicz, which made regular payments to finance beethoven work. Is is also very interesting to see how czech aristocracy were able to remain rich and powerful across the centuries, through international political alliances. Really amazing."

Last, the exhibits were moving especially the Mozart and Beethoven manuscripts. Nothing like seeing the actual scores they worked on. We also had a chance to meet the Prince who was filming an interview. So very personable and connecting.

Michael mentions the laws that made recovery possible, but I would have liked to know more about the effort involved in recovering the household possessions. Did the Communists maintain these with the mansions? Had the family hidden them somewhere? The option, \u201cIf you are interested in hearing more about the reclamation process of this item, enter #145,\u201d or something similar would have been nice. The collection of musical scores is the highlight of the museum, and I enjoyed the signs that explained, especially for the various china sets, how they had entered the family. These stories provide a fascinating look into the inter- and intra-family marriages made to protect or expand one\u2019s property. The last 5 rooms or so offer nowhere for a guest to sit. Due to a private concert, we couldn\u2019t enter the last 2 rooms but were told they would be available in 20 minutes. If there had been anywhere to sit, we might have taken advantage of this offer. Last, there is a bit of a huckster quality to this that bothered me. When you buy your ticket, you are asked if you want to add the mid-day concert. Then the audio guide plugs items you can see by visiting another Lobkowicz palace outside of Prague, and there are signs in very room that say \u201cPrague Inspires Panorama,\u201d which we ultimately learned meant that, for a small fee, we could \u201cExperience Prague like a Prince and Princess from the only private terrace in Prague Castle.\u201d After paying a minimum of 275 korunas (more with add-ons) to hear about the pedigree and fortunes of the palace owners -- or to eat at their upscale cafe -- patrons have to pay to use the water closet. I\u2019m not surprised when public places do this, but it did surprise me in a private museum."

(If you like painted glass ornaments, go there) the castle was in the same family for hundreds of years and the present owner was able to reclaim it after the Velvet Revolution and the fall of Communism. He was a Boston, MA banker. It's fascination lies in the telling of the story of the family and its connection to monarchies of Europe and also to Mozart and Beethoven. Well worth a visit."

You must stop by the amazing Lobkowicz Palace located on the grounds of the Prague Castle. This was not my first time at Lobkowicz Palace, but this time I was treated to a spot not previously open to the public. The second floor balcony looks out on the most spectacular part of the city where you can enjoy an over 180 degree panaramic view of Prague. As if the wonderful people at LP were reading my mind, they have created the new Panaramic Tour of Prague in the tranquil environment of the balcony. William and Sandra Lobkowicz narrate (on your own personal device) an informative, touching, humorous, and heartfelt tour of the majority of Prague. They tell you about the phenomenal buildings, monuments, and sights right in front of you. They also share amusing and historical stories about their family's ancestry and heritage. I learned more about Prague in 30 minutes than ever before. The tour also motivates and inspires you to visit parts of Prague you may not have known about before.After the panaramic tour, you can wander downstairs and enjoy some of the delicious food and drink in the cafe where you will feel more like a local with a new appreciation of the magnificent city of Prague.Thank you Lobkowicz Palace staff and curators for providing me with this unforgettable experience."

It had an amazing number of artworks, manuscripts, china and other items belonging to the family. The history of how the Lobkowicz family had lost all their possessions to the Nazis and then to the Communists, but then had them restored to them was intriguing. We then attended the lunchtime concert, consisting of really excellent performers consisting of a flautist, viola player and pianist. The concert was performed with great panache and was of an extremely high standard. I would suggest paying slightly more for one of the front row seats as they are more comfortable than the seats further back."

It must be the best-run museums in the city of Prague, and the reason is that one of the American-educated scions of the Lobkowica family is in charge of it. Everything having to do with lay-out and presentation of information reveals the most careful planning and logic. Of course that means there is a charming museum shop and a good place to eat. Aside from that, the museum contains art of the highest quality that is essentially unknown to art lovers in western Europe and North American, including masterpieces by Breughel and Canaletto. For music lovers, the connection of the Lobkowicz family to Mozart and Beethoven is fully explained in fascinating ways."

Ditto for the selections. The cafe was crowded, service slow. Food ok. But the views from the terrace were superb and make up for the rest. As for the museum, it was I crowded, staff were gracious and accommodating. Without the (free) audio guide, one could gloss over the rest, concentrate on the Velasquez, Breughel and Canalettos of London. But we very much appreciated the quality of the narration and also hearing of the family history. Great way to spend the afternoon"

The gallery is interesting and family history one of real dedication to homeland and ancestry. The Lobkowicz family were expelled from their property by the Nazis and returned after WW2 only to be re-possessed when Hungary became part of the Communist Bloc. Maximilian Lobkowicz returned from the States to set up the property as we see it now. It's a story of wealth and property accumulated over the centuries which is documented in the Gallery of paintings and artefacts.Our tour included a luncheon and concert. The lunch included a meagre salad, cold goulash and tasteless dumplings. The concert was by a trio the members of which seemed bored and the playing quite mediocre. IF you can, see the Palace without the lunch and concert."

I think the only thing that got my attention was the armory room. We had to end the tour without visiting the last two rooms, because the rooms were closed for a private tour, but nobody told us until we got there.

(The Lobkowicz family were active musicians and very active supporters of composers, and in particular, Beethoven. The display includes some original scores and a number of first editions of works by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. Many of them are pieces that I have studied in the past year. For example, I know that Haydn's Op. 76 string quartets were commissioned as a set of 6. This was 7-8 years before his death but he lacked enough energy to complete more than one (if memory serves me correctly ) and reluctantly published that and another one comprising the inner movements when he realised that he was never going to have the energy again to complete them. So it was a bit emotional for me, not that I expect anyone else to see those scores as mildly interesting."

The admission ticket includes a free audioguide, which takes you through the palace's collections and rooms and through its owners' history as told by the contemporary family members. In my opinion, the audioguide truly enhances the experience, but the pieces on the collection are worth the visit by themselves (for example original scores by Mozart, Beethoven, weapons, musical instruments, porcelain, etc.). In addition to the tour you can purchase a concert add-on which consists of a 1hr chamber music concert. Whilst sone of the performers might not be master performers, some of them are quite good (for example, the viola player) and the concert played in an original baroque setting makes the visit more worthwhile. The prices are quite reasonable and you can easily locate the palace since it is right at the beginning of the castle complex on the golden lane side. Definitely an interesting visit."

The Czech Republic has had a somewhat checkered history over the last century and nowhere is this better expressed than in the story of the Lobkowicz family. The museum itself is spread over two floors, and you need the audio tour in order to fully appreciate this. The English version is narrated by the current generation of Lobkowicz's (which takes some getting used to due to their American upbringing and hence accents) but has huge amounts of interesting details included. If you head there before 1300 local, there is normally a concert on the weekdays; this costs substantially more (it cost us 1000Kr for the concert and museum); as fans of classical, we decided that it was worth the cost. The musicians were of a good standard and the pieces typically well performed. Given they were arranged for limited instruments, it worked quite well! I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but if classical music is your thing, I'd recommend it."

This place was one of my favourite places in Prague. Though the palace is beautiful to wander around, the audio tour, combined with the background music is worth the money itself, not to mention some of the amazing artefacts that are in the museum, from paintings to music scores and instruments and weaponry. A midday concert is also held, with works by composers like Dvorak, Smetana, Mozart and Bach being played. The cafe also offers decent food, with small dishes like soups, cakes etc being served. If you are in the Old Town area/Prague Castle, do not miss this place."

The audio guide (a must) is narrated by the patriarch of the family and the stories are incredibly personalized. It's like you're a guest in the family house and get told what has happened. And that's a lot ! With over 6 centuries of family history laid out you can't help but be impressed with the colossal task the current generation has taken on to restore and maintain the rich cultural heritage of this family. My personal favorite was learning how the 6th prince financed Beethoven that led to the 5th symphony and other well known pieces being composed by him, later honoring the prince by dedicating them to him."

In contrast the Lobkowitz Museum is small, intimate and highly personal. You are provided an amazing audio tour as part of the admission. Members of the Lobkowicz family will guide you through their fascinating history dating back centuries with their profound influence on European art, music, politics and history. The priceless collection of paintings, musical scores, firearms and more are brought into context through their flawless narratives. An abridged tour will take only an hour, but one could and should spend more. After our tour, we relaxed on the terrace of the museum cafe with a spectacular view of Prague and enjoyed a Lobkowicz beer, the brewery dating in origin to the 1500s, with perhaps the best burger in the City. Prague has much to offer the curious and discerning traveler. The Lobkowicz Palace is a highlight."

After spending much of the day touring St. Vitus Cathedral, the palace and dungeon, the Golden Lane, we stopped in because it was on our way and we had just enough time for it. We were very impressed with the personal story of the family, provided through a free audio guide narrated by two members of the Lobkowicz family. The personal touch made everything we saw so much more meaningful, as the portraits on the walls were those of someone's ancestors, and the stories were not only historical but enlightening as to personalities and politics. We found most striking the original scores of music in Beethoven's and Mozart's own hands, whose benefactor was one of the members of the Lobkowicz family. Then the 20th Century story of how the family lost everything to the Nazis, got it back, lost it once again after the Russian takeover, and began the long process of recovering its treasures after the Velvet Revolution was also quite fascinating and gives its own perspective on the recent history of the Czech Republic. Check for the midday classic concerts also, which make the classical music history of the palace and its inhabitants come alive. There's also a cafe with food and views way superior to what you'd expect at a regular tourist attraction. All in all, highly recommended."

Booking online gave us the discount so we didn\u2019t use the tickets but if it were not for that recommendation we may not have gone.We arrived just in time to check in and get front row seats for the concert. There were three musicians \u2013 a pianist, flutist and violinist. They played together and also separately. It was a very lovely concert. After that we got our audio guide and went on the tour. The audio guide was excellent and we really enjoyed hearing the Lobkowicz family story and seeing everything inside the palace. The Arms & Armor collection was very impressive! Seeing the actual Beethoven Manuscripts was really awesome. Since we are dog lovers we really enjoyed how the family pooches were also showcased in portraits. This was one of our favorite places we visited while in Prague. It would have been nice if we were allowed to take pictures.We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and if we return to Prague we would like to see the family castles as well."

Admission is not included on any of the tickets you can buy for the castle tour but it is definitely worth the admission price in my opinion. Admission includes an audio guide which really adds to the experience. Family members talk you through the collections and their family history which is very interesting. The collection is well curated. The key pieces are highlighted with red numbers so if you are pressed for time on your visit to the castle complex a shorter visit is possible. The attraction also has a cafe with an outside terrace and great views of Prague. The Lobkowicz Palace is definitely high on our list of top attractions in Prague."

This museum has about 5 significant pieces of art: two Canaletto paintings, one Breughel, and one each of an original Beethoven and Mozart score. All of these are significant and worth seeing. Beyond that, there is a significant number of second- and third-rate paintings of an aristocratic family going back centuries. There is also a fascinating (and irritatingly told) story behind the museum. I don't think it's worth the steep entry fee, but it's not a total bust, either. Several things about the museum undercut the experience. First, its layout is very traditional, with walls of paintings laid out with little imagination, virtually no interaction, and little care for creating a museum experience. Second, the audio tour requires headphones, meaning that you experience this museum solo, even if you go with friends or loved ones. At one point I took off my headphones and just observed the visitors, and it was absolute silence beyond the quiet shuffling of feet. But the most annoying thing that frustrated me was the self-aggrandizing and unreflective narrative. There is a moving story in this palace--one of an aristocratic family owning castles and great works of art, losing them first to the Nazis and then to the Communists, only to be recovered after the fall of the Iron Curtain and through legal maneuvering. So far so good. But the way the narrative is told is uncritically celebratory of the family prior to the Nazis--praising them for patronizing Beethoven with a beaming pride (that was MY ancestors!!) that redirected visitors' attention away from the public significance of these works and the history they were a part of and instead towards the family's private sense of vindication at getting all their stuff and accompanying status, stolen for half a century by bad guys, back. That this wealth was connected to colonialism, to the crushing servitude of God knows how many other Beethovens too poor let near a violin, to brutal wars of pride and power--is a story untold. Perhaps Lobkowicz's beloved ancestors were also bad guys--I don't know. But their recent photos posed with heads of state (including a bunch of the Bushes) suggests that their return to their righteous aristocracy is complete, and they may now once again stand above all of us and we may look up to them in admiration. And so between the underwhelming quality of most (but not all) of the art and the self-congratulatory historical narrative, my wife and I came away disappointed--it could have been so much more than this, and for the price of admission, should have been."

We were walking the castle grounds, somewhat overwhelmed by the crowds, and having chosen not to pay for the castle complex tour (the lines at St Vitus were so long!) we almost walked right by this palace, but a banner advertising the collection of original Mozart and Beethoven scores caught my husband's eye, and we decided to take a tour. It ended up being one of the most interesting things we did on our trip! The present-day family members narrate the audio guide (included in ticket price) and tell the fascinating story of their family history and the recent history of having lost and regained their palaces and land two times in the 20th century.Most of the museum is comprised of old family portraits of the early Count Lobkowiczs and their wives and children. There's also a display of china and firearms. The music collection really was fascinating. The (7th?) Count Lobkowicz was a parton of Beethoven and thus Beethoven dedicated several of his major works to the Count. The collection includes ORIGINAL scores of the 3rd, 4th and 5th symphonies! Then there is the original re-orchestration that Mozart did of Handel's Messiah in his own hand! My husband, a professional trombone player, really liked seeing this as Mozart's version fleshes out the Messiah with a fuller orchestra, including trombones. He also loved the thought that the original Beethoven works were right there, separated by glass of course, but there's always been a debate over a high note ...if only he could have seen inside the score!There was a concert in session and we heard parts of that as we toured the downstairs rooms. We did not eat at the cafe but everything I read says that it's a nice spot.It was nice to get this glimpse of a family with such history and to do it in relative silence. There were very few people touring the palace when we were there."

Original transcripts from Mozart are on display as well as: instruments, rifles, swords, Dutch ceramics, presents to and from the heads of state, two Canaletto masterpieces and a Breughal reclaimed from the salt mines during WWII. The audio is excellent. Such a treasure, and so worth the trip to Prague."

The original owners of this palace (and many other impressive estates) lost their home and their possessions not once, but twice during the last century. Once under the Nazi regime and then again under the Communists. The audio tour is really good, spoken by the current owner, whose love and knowledge of the family history comes through with every word. There are many interesting artefacts and portraits of family members plus a few famous paintings - one by Brueghel, two by Canaletto. After the tourist trap that is the rest of Prague, this visit was refreshing and worth the entrance fee."

Although the history and the art were both interesting, I was disappointed that there were no rooms to view, that were kept in tact while this Palace was in use as such. So, there are many places to see while in Prague, and if you love paintings and other objects of art, you'll enjoy this stop.

The original music scores were amazing as well as the paintings and stories about the family. At the end we had lunch in the cafe and it was very nice and certainly not overpriced."

The devotion to music is displayed in the music room. Here you will see the original 5th symphony in Beethoven's hand. Unbelievable. And, Handel's Messiah arranged by Mozart. Music lovers, if you are in Prague, don't miss this."

Got there just in time for the 1:00PM concert which was superb! The rest of the palace was so full of interesting items that we spent all afternoon there! From the Canelettos to the Brughel, the Mozart and Beethoven scores, and all the family memorabilia - just so intriguing. Highly recommend this!"

The Lobkowicz Palace has a heart-stopping view of the city but, more importantly, a fascinating history. It was built by the family in the 1500s, and run (along with several other palaces in the Bohemian area) by the Lobkowicz family until it was taken by the Nazis. It was given back after the war, but then taken again by the Communists. It is now back in the hands of the family along with a historical treasure trove of musical manuscripts (Beethoven's 5th in his own hand, Handel's Messiah also in his own hand), priceless artwork, ceramics, musical instruments, and on and on. Definitely a don't-miss place while in Prague. Probably difficult for people with difficulty walking -- lots of cobblestones and stairs, and probably no elevator."

The real catches at this museum (in the old family palace in the Castle Quarter) are the two 'London' Canelettos, and the fact that you can come nose-to-page with Beethoven first editions and Mozart's own handwriting. The exhibition rooms are grouped by subject and type of painting or drawing. The rooms are smaller, and have no place to sit and take the works in, which for me was a flaw."

It is excellent and has family history for hundreds and hundreds of years with original paintings, manuscripts and a wonderful story by the current family members.

I walked into the lobby and saw a short description of Lobkowicz Palace. I could hear music coming from a room upstairs. A concert was taking place. The short summary of the Palace told of the Lobkowowicz Family and their trials and tribulations as they fought to keep the many treasures of the Palace through the war years and even through the cold war years. The treasures include handwritten manuscripts by both Mozart and Beethoven. That alone was enough to get me to purchase a ticket and enter. The audio guide has descriptions of the treasures and the history of the palace all given by Lobkowicz Family members, adding a personal touch to the experience. There was another concert about to begin as I was leaving."

The story of the palace from its Imperial rise to greatness, as well as twice downward spiral and final resurrection to today is told in the words of the family that bears it's name. This unique, personal narrative is unlike any other museum that I have ever experienced and makes the history relevant and palpable. There is a shorter tour and a longer, 75 minute tour, that I wished had gone on for longer. There is also a nice restaurant in the back of the museum which overlooks the city scape. There is a 10% discount at the restaurant if you buy A ticket for the museum. This is truly a do not miss stop on any tour of Prague!!"

Buying tickets on line is easy and affordable (discounted for combination 1PM concert and palace; also senior rates). We had to change the date ticketed and they handled this quickly and pleasantly. The collection of the current owner, William Lobkowicz (no longer titled 'Prince') is amazing! The audio guide is included and worth listening to as it tells the story of this powerful, cultural family and how they came to collect such rarities as original music scores by Beethoven and Mozart. Seeing these showcased was more inspiring than I'd ever imagine. GO..and reserve the 'gold' seats for the daily concert- 3 instruments, mostly known music, and the gold seats are the first 2 rows and much more comfortable, padded seats. Also, the cafe is lovely and you must find the chocolate kiosk and pray they still are serving the melted chocolate cup. Heaven on a boiling hot day!"

Other beneficiaries were Mozart, Haydn and even Gluck, son of one of Lobkowicz's foresters.The Lobkowicz family's connections with the arts are many. This tour is a real education and the government's restoration to them of their land and assets has been justified by their careful stewardship of them for the benefit of posterity.

The fact that their lands and collections were lost and returned twice due to first the Nazis and then the Communists and the tenacity of the family to work to restore their family history could be a movie. Highly recommend."

The Lobkowicz Palace, though located on the extremely touristy castle hill, is easy to miss because it is separate from the other, more popular, tours of the cathedral and Hapsburg Palace. It is definitely worth the time to check it out, and, because it is easy to miss, it has the added advantage of being much less busy than the neighboring attractions. The audio tour guide is included in the ticket price and, in the English version at least, is done by the current head of the family. The art and artifacts included all have Lobkowicz family connections which makes the collection coherent.Musical performances (separate fee) are also offered at the Palace.One word of advice is to skip the cafe in the Palace as it seemed extremely overpriced and not really special."

It's well worth a visit, especially to see the original Beethoven manuscripts and the art and delft collections."

It is an almost perfect collection - I dare you to find something that wont fascinate you here - and is beautifully curated. It gives you firstly a sense of the history of Bohemia and secondly a fascinating glimpse of the landed gentry of Europe. This is the home of an immensely cultured family and even things that would not normally interest me eg the delft collection and the guns, were of such quality that it is just amazing that it is all still intact.The highlight has to be the music room with the original manuscripts by Mozart and Beethoven but an outstanding Breughel is worth the admission alone. The audio tour (which comes with the admission) is excellent and helpfully highlights the best pieces so that if you are short of time you could do this in little more than an hour - but please allow a little more time to savour some of the most awe inspiring things you may ever see."

We thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. After the sun-soaked starkness and heat of the interior courtyards of Prague Castle, entering the Lobkowicz Palace is a refreshing change. Our lunch of Czech-style goulash with dumplings was excellent and the dessert of homemade cheesecake with wild berry sauce was really yummy. It was a nice way to begin our visit. The art and objects on display make up one of the finest private collections that we have seen. Of particular meaning to us was seeing the score of Handel's Messiah annotated by Mozart for his re-orchestration of the work - Year 1789. The family story is also fascinating and is brought to life by the narration by the youngest members of the Lobkowicz family. The recorded tour is extremely well done and it was nice to be able to move through the rooms at our own speed. Views from the terrace are, of course, beautiful. If one visits Prague Castle, besides St. Vitus Cathedral, a visit to the Lobkowicz Palace is worth the time. Don't miss it!"

I didn't really want to visit another palace, but I went along with it and I am very glad I did. It is a family's art collection. It is primarily paintings, but there are other things as well. The original manuscripts from Mozart and Beethoven were incredible to see. What really made the visit worthwhile was the way that the stories around the collection are told. The family narrates the audio guide, which makes for a far more personal experience than at a typical art museum. The stories they share are fascinating. They also explain how the collection was confiscated, and a bit of what it took to get it back. Very, very worthwhile stop. It's also a good way to escape the crowds at Prague Castle :)"

One of the oldest and wealthiest families in the country, their family history is intertwined with the history of the Czechs. Their Palace is actually located within the confines of Prague Castle, the only privately owned property there. It contains the artworks and treasures that the family has collected over the centuries. The family has lost and regained its proper twice, first under the Germans in WWII, and a second time under the communists after WWII. The were able to regain the property after the liberation of the Czech Republic in the 1990s, but as the family had relocated to the United States, they decided to open their properties and collections to the public. Of particular interest is the fact that the English narration on the audio tour was done by William Lobkowicz which gives the tour of the collection a very intimate feel, such as when he refers to his grandfather, or his aunt obtaining something in the collection. And what a collection it is. On display are original manuscripts of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven compositions. The most valuable item is probably the manuscript of Beethoven\u00b4s Opus 55, Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major (Eroica), composed in 1803/04. Beethoven had originally conceived of dedicating the symphony to Napoleon Bonaparte, but instead dedicated the symphony to Prince Joseph Franz Maximilian Lobkowicz. This Lobkowicz ancestor was also dedicatee of some other great works, including Joseph Haydn's \"Lobkowitz\" quartets (Opus 77), and Beethoven's 5th and 6th symphonies, as well as his Opus 18 string quartets. It is amazing to think that this family had a hand in the creation of some of the greatest musical works everwritten. There is also a daily midday concert on the premises for an extra charge, but is well worth attending. It consists of a flautist, viola player and a pianist who were all quite talented, and is an hour of enertaining music played in a beautiful drawing room. A combination ticket for the place and the concert gives a discount on admission.Last, but not least, there is a very reasonably priced cafe on the premises where we had a very nice lunch after we toured the collections. Highly recommended. "

The cafe in which this family took to restore their history and this Palace is amazing. Also has a great cafe with beautiful views of the city."

The museum itself is a delight with excellent audio commentary available as part of the ticket. Take time to soak it up. The connection of the Lobkowicz family to musical greats like Mozart and Beethoven is a fascinating part of their family history. We also took in the one hour concert which is extra and needs to be booked well in advance. This was magnificent - piano, viola and flute.The is also a good cafe. Try to get a table on the outside deck overlooking the city for a superb panorama"

We spent a good share of the day there going through the collections (paintings, ceramics, arms and armor, musical scores) with the included audio device, having a lovely lunch on the balcony of the restaurant, attended the concert, shopped for a few treasures in the gift shop. We tour on a bit of a budget and this entire experience didn't tax our budget over much. I can't praise it highly enough - when we return to Prague, we will definitely return to the Lobkowicz Palace. This day will live in our memories."

It is also one of those places that seems to be ignored by the followers of the colourful umbrellas and giant flowers - the tour groups! You can therefore enjoy the visit without too many crowds. For me the museum is excellent and made all the more interesting and personal by the fact that the narrator on the audio guide was William Lobkowicz himself. The family story is a powerful and moving one and I for one am delighted to see the property back in the hands of the original owners after the decades of turmoil in the last century. The fact that the family is prepared to put all these items on show for the public to see in a museum, to me, speaks volumes about them. Not everyone is prepared to do that. There is a wide variety of exhibits to enjoy - paintings, weapons and other artefacts. If you are interested in the history of music there is some fascinating material. I entirely agree with the \"Hidden Gem\" description. It isn't cheap, but then very few things in life are. It was well worth the money for us and I certainly don't mind paying for the upkeep of the kind of treasures that the museum houses. There is also a good little caf\u00e9.All in all, a great visit and another \"must\" if you are off to Prague."

The first room, full of family protraits at first seemed uninteresting until we listened to the included audio guide, spoken by the current Prince Lobkowicz. He led us through the amazing tale of his family's history from the 16th century to today, bringing the various family members to life and culminating in how they had lost everything not once but twice, first to the Nazis and then in the early 50's to the communists and how they had eventually recovered nearly all of their numerous Castles and Palaces and the priceless collections of art and furniture.The palace feels very much a home inspite of the grandeur; the staff were friendly and there were touches like an account of the family dogs over the centuries.

The tour ended up at the Castle, cathedral, and President's building, where we were picked up by a Viking Tour of the Lobkowicz Palace, the only privately owned property at the Castle. No one should miss seeing this, the highlight of our tour of Prague; we spent some time walking through the private art collection that was stolen by the Nazis and held captive by the communists until 1989. The Lobkowicz family has been reconstructing the collection since then. Family members narrated the audio tour that explained the art, the history, and the current state of the collection. A short concert of classical selections by a pianist, violinist, and cellist followed the art exhibit, a real touch of elegance. More to come-- we were wined and dined in a lovely room in the palace, and after lunch, Mr. Lobkowicz came in to visit with us and answer questions. From Boston, he was informal, informative, and totally charming. Evidently, he came to visit our group because we were the first Viking tour group of the season.If you are visiting Prague, this is a do-not-miss stop. If you are on a Viking tour, GO!"

The tour included an amazing lunch in one of the ballrooms which had an amazing view of Prague. The treasures this family was able to claim back after the war is astounding. Mr. Lobkowicz was able to come and speak with our group during lunch and hearing the story of his family and how they were able to get the Palace back is truly a great historical story. Being American is was very interesting to hear how they were able to come back to Prague and claim their property and all the hard work it took. The audio tour is very informative and easy to follow. The tour itself will take you an hour or two if you want to listen to everything. They have a \"fast track\" path to follow if you just want to \"cliff notes\" version of the museum. They gave us a concert of classical music which was awesome as well!"

After this, we went to a small room for a short concert of classical music played by a trio (piano, cello, violin). The classical music included pieces by Mozart, Bartok, etc. After the concert, we went through a museum of paintings, dishes, guns, and much more, accumulated by the Lobkowicz family.

            "review": "Very enjoyable experience. The Lobkowiczs have hit upon an absolutely wonderful formula for a museum-going experience, which seriously deserves to be emulated (and should to be a required experienced for many a museum curator). Because everything in the collection is presented within the larger story of the Lobkowicz family, which is superbly scripted and told on the audiophones (without any of the affectation, pretension, or indulgent/excessive details that characterize too many audiophone experiences), the pieces in the collection are given true meaning. I normally walk through a museum room full of paintings of 15th-century nobility because there is no way to appreciate them--'if you've seen one, you've seen them all.' Yet, here I ended up spending more than half an hour in the first room because the Lobkowicz's stories of who they were (masterfully combined with touches like a personal letter between a wife and husband and details of what happened to a garnet ring in one painting) were engaging and interesting. I spent almost two hours, listening to all the audiophone recordings and studying the collection presented in just a few rooms on two floors. Wafting through the rooms was the live classical music of the midday concert that sounded delightful and, like everything so tastefully presented here, also was so much more real than what is usually served up in a museum-going experience meant to be cultured. In particular, so much of our museum-going experiences these days are structured around a particular curator's theory, interests, or passion (which ultimately decontextualizes the objects and renders them as merely objects of curiosity and ultimately unreal) that having a collection set in its historically authentic story was wonderful. Here you can appreciate things with the Lobkowiczs who are authentically sharing a history as if you were their personal guest."

I took the audioguide and when up, you begin with painted portraits, then porcelaine services, religious artefacts, weapons, music, painted animals and some kind of conference room/chapel. Everything is perfectly preserved, they have done an exceptional work with that. The audioguide explains the relations between the family and some of those piece of art, gives you some historical details... The obvious gems are the manuscripts from known composers but I also loved the last room that I felt had something special. Photos are prohibited. Definitely a really good private collection that survived the war. If you like paintings you will probably enjoy it and learn a thing or two about Prague at the same time."

For 275 CZK you are given an audio guide in your preferred language, which will give you insights at the numbered locations. There are over 30 recordings, but they are almost all historical information about the family, their weddings, love of dogs, how they lost and regained the palace. Most of the tour is paintings of family members, though there is an entire room dedicated to paintings of family dogs. I didn't find most of that interesting, because I have no stake in the family. They do have two rooms filled with old weapons, and probably the most interesting room to me was the music room which had a story about how one of the princes of the castle had Mozart stay there and write an opera and another story about having Beethoven on retainer so he could just write whatever music he wanted.The tour comes with a very small savings in the gift shop, and 10% off in the cafe, which is why I went into the cafe. This turned out to be the best part of the morning for me. The cafe has a terrace seating area which, in the early morning in February, was a quiet and peaceful way to prepare for the day. Their apple strudel is the best I've had in Prague. Next time I am up near the castle I will definitely stop back into the cafe, which can be accessed without the tour through another entrance.I didn't mind the tour, but I wouldn't do it again, and I didn't listen to the entire series of recordings."

Narrated by family members, it is informative, amusing and really easy to enjoy.The only criticism is that the audio gives the impression you can look at some old letters that are under a covered case. The case even has little handles to lift the cover. When we did, a very rude young woman leapt forward very aggressively. Exactly the same happened with two other couples while we were still in the gallery. They should change the audio, or add a clear sign, and/or train the room attendant to be more pleasant in her approach.Other than that... Marvellous museum. I loved it."

It is both an interesting and engrossing family respective of roots forced to take flight. Visited this site as a guest of Viking Cruise as an added excursion. To that end, it was maybe less cost effective, but it was an all inclusive private luncheon, concert and tour with other guests and we very much enjoyed the whole experience. The audio tour of the rooms and exhibits was thorough and informative as the members of the Lobkowicz family discussed their deep rooted connections to Prague throughout many centuries. The art and artifacts are the family's personal collections lost and then reassembled with great effort. Quite an accomplishment. The palace interior details are beautiful although photography opportunities were limited.A visit to Lobkowicz Palace is recommended, especially if you have a few days to devote to the Prague Castle complex. It will certainly take that long get from one end to the other and absorb the richness of the past. Again, as this was only a portion of our trip to Central Europe, by choosing to visit this site we did not feel compelled to visit other larger museums or palaces with similar offerings."

It's a great story of this families history and their struggle to preserve some fantastic pieces of art and heritage. The tour (at least the English one) is told by the family themselves, seeing as most of them spent more time in England than at their natural home. Apparently it's not unusual either to bump into one of the family while wondering around. There are some great exhibits, and was amazed to learn this about the ties they have to some of the great composers. We stopped for lunch before the concert at the in-house restaurant, tasty simple food that you get a lot of!

Overfacing even for the diehard architecture-buff. Most of these mansions are now deserted or in institutional use, but the one shining example of a resurgent palace is the Lobkowicz Palace. At the rear of Prague castle, there lies a treasure trove of world stature. Visited by only a few of those passing its vast door, this mansion displays some of the recovered possessions of this once vast land-owning family. That these pieces have been restituted is extraordinary in itself, but the way that they are displayed and the way the audio-guide takes you round in a familiar and personal manner is a tribute to, not just, technology, but to the imagination of the owners. Prince Lobkowicz (now ostentatiously \"Mr\"Lobkowicz) describes his inheritance, maiolica, portraits, silver, jewels, musical instruments and scores, as if he were at your side. Particularly moving is to stand in front to the \"Eroica\" symphony's original score with the music playing in your ear. Finally as the feet begin to give out and the eyes glaze over you come to the final bare room where hang two vast and magnificent paintings of London's river by Antonio Canaletto. Spectacular! Outside tourists of all nationalities troop past glued to there i-phones oblivious of all that is within."

This is a very well-organised museum about the history of the Lobkowicz family and their art/weapon/porcellain/music collections. Through the example of one important Czech noble family, you can get a deeper understanding of Czech (and European) history over the last few hundred centuries in different regards (culture, music, customs, connection with Austria/Spain etc.). Every visitor is equipped with an audio guide (different languages available) which comprises all the essential information. I really enjoyed the audio tour and the fact that someone was telling the history of the family and the artworks like in a conversation - partly the family members themselves are telling the story. It's an easy way of learning about and understanding history. The exhibition is laid out on two floors of which the upper floor contains the more meaningful exhibits, so calculate more time for it. We spent about an hour upstairs, listening to all the numbers in the audio tour. The lower floor takes less time, about 30 mins. For visitors who have less time the important numbers are marked in red, so they can skip all the other numbers. Note that on their website they offer discounted combo packages.Overall we really enjoyed our visit and would absolutely recommend it. However, there is still room for improvement. One of the most striking pieces in the exhibition are original works by Mozart and Beethoven. For us, these were by far the most significant exhibits and we wondered why two big rooms are dedicated to weapons and just one small room to music, even though the family plaid such a significant role in developing some of the most famous compositions. E.g. we would have liked to have a look inside the scores of the Eroica written by Beethoven instead of seeing just the cover. Also, the history of the centuries before the 20th is told in detail which is very interested and gives great insights into the European history and the role of the nobility. But very little information is given about the 20th century family history, about the flight of the family, their life in exile and their return, their life today and how they manage to maintain all the property that was restituted to them. We would have been interested in hearing more about this more recent history. Finally, one needs to bear in mind that the history is told by the family, so I don't know how objectively it is told. If there are other versions to it, you won't hear about them in this exhibition. A midday concert is offered from 1-2pm which we attended. We didn't regret it. Three chamber musicians play popular pieces by Beethoven, Mozart, Smetana and others. It's a nice way to let everything sink in, relax and enjoy. We had lunch at the Palace Caf\u00e9 after and were happy with that, too (see separate review)."

If you buy the combo ticket you get to see the exquisite museum and enjoy the delightful concert. I was amazed that the small but beautiful concert hall was only half full when the castle was so crowded you could hardly move. The palace/ concert is the best deal in town. The ticket was about $25 US and it included a 10% discount at the lovely cafe. Be sure to go outside and see the breathtaking views. The music room is fascinating.

As palaces go, it is very lacking in furniture, I presume the nazi's pinched all the original, and the communists didn't buy any new furniture, so you are left with a large palace with empty rooms but lots of paintings - I can see why the nazi's left a lot of these apart from the Canaletto views of London which are beautiful.Despite these issues, I was entranced by the story told on audio guide by the current family which made the exhibits much more interesting and personal. The dog Room, for instance, has some ordinary pictures of dogs but when you hear bout them from their owners it makes the paintings come alive.There are some interesting musical exhibits, including items used by Beethoven himself. It took us about an hour and a half to stroll around here and we were glad we did, but make sure you get an audio tour."

They had extensive land holdings and a fabulous art collection, which they lost twice (once to the Nazis, and then again to the Communists). However, after the Velvet Revolution, the Czech government passed legislation for restitution of private property, and the Lobkowicz family, by then in the United States, got it all back. William Lobkowicz, the current heir, narrates (most of) the included audio guide, and the effect is pretty electrifying, as he relates Czech and family history in terms of two floors of objets d'art, including some amazing things like original Beethoven, Hayden, and Mozart scores (Beethoven dedicated 7 of his works to the contemporary Lobkowicz, including Symphonies 3, 5, and 6), paintings by Rubens, Brueghel, and Canaletto, Croll (who painted the family's 13 castles).I don't know quite how I feel about this kind of art in private hands, but the fact that the Czechs gave it back says a lot about their country, and the chance to hear the story from this scion of an ancient noble family was lesson in history there are few opportunities to get. I don't really see Elizabeth II narrating an audio guide, do you?"

Having read about the Lobkowicz Palace in the Rick Steve book, and as an avid museum goer, I was very interested in visiting this site, plus I had also read that the cafe there was the best place to have lunch while in the Palace area. One tip I learned too late: if you plan to tour the palace, buy your ticket first and THEN have lunch in the cafe, as they give a 10% discount both in the cafe and in the gift shop, which I didn't get to take advantage of .The included audio guide really makes the palace come alive- as it is narrated by the current Prince Lobkowicz, who actually was raised in the US and is trying to keep the various Lobkowicz inheritances (palaces and the like) not only afloat but actively engaging with the larger audience. He succeeds magnificently, in our opinion. This spot, very near the palace, was one of the highlights of our four day visit to Prague. I encourage you to visit!"

It'd already signed up for the Lobkowicz Palace tour, however, so I figured what-the-heck. And now I'm glad I did! I'm not a huge art history buff and when I saw rooms filled with portraits of people I didn't know, I groaned internally, However, the way the tour was organized, with excellent narration by William Lobkowicz and nice accompanying music, I left very impressed and certainly with a much better appreciation of European history. Each room has a different theme, ranging from some of the earliest porcelain dinner settings used in Europe, to original musical scores of Mozart and Beethoven. I especially enjoyed the armory room and the impressive collection of musical instruments. We were treated to a very nice lunch and a wonderful chamber orchestra concert (by members of the National Symphony no less!) as part of our tour. It was an afternoon well spent."

The midday classical concert, which takes place in one of the rooms in which the family historically hosted concerts, was truly magnificent and uplifting, and well worth planning around. The castle, which is now a museum chronicling the family's history, was very interesting, and was tastefully interwoven with magnificent art works, music collections and armaments. Seeing Beethoven's original handwritten scores for the third, fourth and fifth symphonies, dedicated to eh family which acted as his patron, was very special. If you have time for only one attraction in the Prague Castle, I would highly recommend that you choose Lobkowicz Castle."

The palace is a fascinating collection of Czech history and of the Lobkowicz family and it's amazing it was able to be retrieved after WWII. However, at 100 Euros apiece (including lunch which was OK but nothing special), it was a bit on the pricey side and we found out that the musical quartet who performed for us can be viewed virtually everyday. The brochure also gave the distinct impression Prince Lobkowicz himself would stop by to say hello when that's not the case as all - he merely narrates the prerecorded audio tour. It's an interesting bit of history but you can probably set the tour up by yourself and save some $$."

Take the audio tour! It's really well done, as is the entire presentation of the collection. Highlights include original manuscripts by Mozart and Beethoven (and the amazing story of the Lobkowicz connection with Beethoven in particular), the Brueghel painting, and the Canalettos - but the many family portraits from across the centuries, and the decorative arts displayed are all of great quality and interest.

The concert was advertised as a trio, yet no flute, just piano and violin. The violinist was very skilled yet played in only about half the songs. The pianist played all the notes correctly yet reminded me of a piano teacher, lacking finesse to create a variety of moods. The piano also seemed a bit out of tune. The self guided tour of the museum (with audio-guide) was interesting. The family's fascination with their dogs (paintings/sculpture) and financial support of famous composers was a great back story of the palace. Enjoyed a quiet visit at one of the more obscure buildings on Castle Hill. Also consider eating at the cafe - good simple food."

It was very different from the concerts in the chapels, churches, and the other bigger venues in Prague. Highly recommended!

We have taken a break in their terrace cafe when visiting the castle area on our previous visits to Prague, but never took the time to visit the museum. It rained that day and it was a perfect timing since a classical music concert was starting at 1PM. With just enough time to buy a combo ticket ( museum and concert) we were ready to sit down and relax in the beautiful surroundings. The pianist and violinist were accomplished musicians and couple of times I was moved to tears. We then walked through the museum rooms and displays, stopping at what interested us most. You can spend as much time as you want, and I was surprised, that it was not crowded. I took off one star for the following reasons:The line for tickets was painfully slow (people not having correct change, trying to decide what kind of ticket to buy and only one person handling the register.) We worried that we will miss the beginning of the concert. The tickets we bought hurriedly were not the most expensive ones. The first two rows with chairs covered in white slipcovers were the priciest. We bought the rows behind the first two- the so called blue chairs. Wrong decision! The \"blue\" chairs were crammed together- small - highly uncomfortable chairs (no padding), that one would find in the street cafes. I was hoping to be comfortable for an hour and found myself fidgeting and with a hurting back afterwards. Even just the appearance of these chairs in the beautiful room of a palace seemed out of place. I understand that the more chairs you fit in, the more money you make. But no matter how you look at it, these chairs did not fit the beautiful surroundings.One more thing: The ticket price is very affordable to tourists like us, but I have been told, that the czech people , especially the generation that lived under the communist regime, may not be able to afford to see the beautiful palace and the concert. And one more thing: A very small bottle of mineral water at the cafe is 90 crowns- about $4.50. The most I ever paid for water! We enjoyed the coffee and cheesecake and above all the beautiful view from the terrace. The palace is relatively easy to find, If you are leaving the castle area. It is located just below the slight hill that leads to Zlata Ulicka. The entrance to the palace will be on your right if you are going down the hill towards the city center."

The art, porcelain and weaponry ( if you like that) are truly wonderful. The music collection to me was the highlight. Original manuscripts of Beethoven and Mozart with fascinating descriptions of the Lobkovicz influence in the creation of these masterpieces. Unbelievable stuff!!! Take the time to hear a lovely classical concert every day at 1:00 in one of the music room of the palace. An addtional plus is the food and drink offered in their cafe- some of the best food in the castle area. The Lobkovicz Palace should not be missed, especially if you are a music lover!"

It was the story of how, facing bankruptcy because of taxes, the Duke set about turning his family home into a cultural attraction as well as a tourist attraction. And a money-maker. The Lobkowicz family is demonstrating how, confronted with the challenge of unbelievable and unexpected circumstances, they have responded. Clearly they had the brains and assets to respond well in a situation that some might describe as making lemonade after being handed lemons.Lobkowicz Palace is a good museum with a collection that has something for almost anyone, from weapons to paintings to china, and what makes it really interesting and unusual is how the family tells their story. It's a story that isn't all that unusual anywhere in Europe. The museum is professionally curated and well presented. I wanted to see it specifically because of its two Canalettos, and more importantly it's Brueghel, which is one of five in a series. The others can only be seen in Vienna and New York. I can now brag that I have seen all five!It's pretty clear that despite the pretty steep admission price, that the museum is not necessarily a money-making proposition. It is likely that the special events (weddings, banquets, meetings) are. And the only criticism I have is that money was solicited to use the restroom. A somewhat better attraction is Benesov Palace, which is an easy thirty minute train ride from Prague. There you can see the private spaces of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, whose assassination brought about World War I. The bullet that killed his wife is on display (whether that's in good taste is for you to decide.)"

There are few palaces left in the world that one can actually imagine as someone's home, but in the Lobkowicz Palace a visitor can actually imagine a family calling it - home. In fact, remarkably, it is THE only private residence of the Prague Castle complex and as such is worthy of at least a stroll through, but go ages take an audio tour and you are likely to see the palace in an entirely new light. The audio guide is free!!! The star of the visit is, of course, the art collection of the Lobkowicz family, comprised of many family portraits. In most museums it is easy to forget that much of art used to be portraits of well-off patrons and of religious significance, a visit to this museum palace and particularly the audio tour brings this into focus, as one strolls through the rooms enjoying the lively narrative about the portraitures and many both interesting and typical objects belonging to the family. The Palace is relatively compact, so a tour is relatively quick and definitely gives one a glimpse of life that is long gone, although the story of reacquiring long nationalized possessions gives it some contemporary significance.As I was traveling with my teenage son, we follow a rule of eating only \"local\" food while on vacations\u2026 The terrace restaurant was the only exception on this trip. Since the Lobkowicz family, before returning to The Czech Republic to reclaim their confiscated possessions, grew up and lived in the US, my son was thrilled to order a good ol' american cheeseburger with french fries. And that's exactly what he got, and loved it. My lunch was equally well executed albeit a bit more middle european - a chicken schnitzel. The lunch on the terrace is lovely and a great place to take a break from all that walking.Overall, the Lobkowicz Palace is a truly unique experience and is an integral part of seeing ALL of the Prague Castle treasures."

The paintings are remarkably well preserved along many exhibits that I was surprised to see on display. There were paintings made of feathers, guns of various nature and manuscripts of original works from beethoven and Mozart. Overall, I was amazed and despite the short time spent in the museum, it was certainly a treat and we'll worth the price of admission.

There is a very nice caf\u00e9 in the Lobkowicz Palace for lunch, make sure to ask for a table on the terrace that over looks the city and has a great view."

I was grabbed by the poster outside advertising that they have original Beethoven and Mozart manuscripts on display. It got my attention so much that we decided to drop off from our original lackluster overview tour, just so that we can spend time to visit the Lobkowicz Palace. That turned to be the best decision we have made during our visit to Prague. The Lobkowicz Palace is amazing! The audio guide was narrated by the current living Prince Lobkowicz. Prince Lobkowicz returned to Czech Republic from the United States to take back ownership of the Palace. All the displays were well maintained and his narration was personal and informative. Finally, seeing the original manuscript of the Beethoven 3rd Symphony at the Palace was the highlight of my Prague visit."

The museum included original manuscripts by Mozart and others! The audio is by members of the current family who tell some of their own experiences in assembling and presenting the artifacts.

The art work collection is nice, but there aren't too many standouts. The most amazing part of the collection is for music lovers. Past members of the Lobkowicz family were patrons of Mozart and Beethoven, and they have kept some of the artifacts from that time. Seeing things written in Beethoven and Mozart's own hand was quite moving.The personal story of William and his family, as they narrate, was also touching. I was happy that my ticket money will go towards helping the family maintain and continue to restore this lovely piece of history. The ticket price was reasonable, and comes with a free audio guide."

Plus we could get a ticket that included a tour of the Palace. We didn't really know what to expect. Firstly, the concert was really lovely. Jan Sr\u00e1mek on viola and Sylvie Jazkova on piano were professional, accomplished musicians. They played some solos and duets, some familiar (the eternal Moldau by Smetana, but in a piano rather than orchestral rendition; F\u00fcr Elise, but in a duet for piano and viola) and unfamiliar (a sonata for viola and piano by Henri Eccles). One hour of lovely music. Then came the tour of the Palace, including an audio by the current head of the family and some other family members. We were amazed at the wealth of the collection, including manuscripts of Beethoven and Mozart, paintings by Brueghel and Velasquez and Canaletto and much more. The bird pictures, made from feathers of those birds, were intriguing and beautiful. Others may sneer at the portraits of the family pets, but as fellow pug-owners we were enchanted. The display of armour and weaponry was fantastic. I also loved the many portraits of women BY a woman - so very unusual. The account of the history of the collection, its confiscation by the Nazis and then the Communists, followed by the restitution, was a poignant reminder of the convulsions this country has seen in the last century. Overall, not to be missed."

There are many beautifully decorated rooms where you can study paintings of members of the family going back centuries. Treasures on display include beautiful furniture and carved boxes, plus the piece de resistance, Millet's \"Haymaking\", one of his five existing paintings of peasant seasonal activities (3 are in Vienna and the fourth at the Met in New York.) There are lovely paintings by an artist hired by the family to depict their various castles and holdings, and a \"bird room\" the walls of which are covered by carefully-restored pictures of birds made from bird feathers. The story of how the family lost its property while under German control in WWII, getting it back in 1945 only to lose it again in 1948 when the Communists took over, is poignant. Also visit the nice gift shop, where you can buy a woven wall hanging if the \"Haymaking\" scene, and eat on the balcony of the palace cafe, where you'll pay $5 for a 20-ounce Fanta but the view is astonishing."

This is hands down a must do in Prague. The physical scene - the palace, the art, the armor, the rooms - are impressive, but it is the story as told on the audio guide by Lobkowitz family members that makes this site so special. This is a great example of how compelling a personal story can make lessons in history and art. As you move through the rooms listening to the audio guide you fall into the family's story as you might fall into a good movie or book. We gobbled up every last piece and both felt that this was easily the best site in the castle quarter to take in. The Lobkowitz family members who tell you their story hit just the right tone of acknowledging that they are members of a gloriously wealthy and noble family while also remaining quite human and humble about their history. You come away thinking you might like to meet these nice people over a beer to thank them for sharing."

What I had to show mum was amazing which begins with going through a tour of the very valuable Lobkowicz collection which was quite unique and pleasing but with ease to the eye not only for myself but to my mother who has a great love for her classical composers. Although I had visited the palace in November 2007, the information I soaked in last time from the tour was priceless. I couldn't wait to show mum what was inside the Music Room which have the beautiful original compositions of Beethoven, Handel and Mozart (to name a few) and how they came about.May I say that it marked a special day for my mother in which she will never forget...It was one of the highlights of our visit.I came on a holiday to Prague this time with my mother so that I could show her the absolute richness in history and culture one city (Prague) possesses and the impressive architecture that surrounds the city and historical buildings, plus never forgetting the delicious food and beverage it has to offer...I highly recommend it."

While I do understand the family's desire to preserve a part of Czech history/culture it makes one wonder how they acquired all the wealth they are reclaiming. In addition, 5 rooms were closed on the day of our visit for a special function. We were not told we would not have access to the entire collection and when inquired at the ticket desk we were told to come back the next day. I hope Mr. Lobkowicz reads the reviews."

The audioguide in English is a must -- you hear from the familty members... not only about the history of the palace, the art collected there, but also how the newly democratic Czech government restored the property seized by the communists. And they love dogs! Great stuff! It only requires an hour or two... plus the cafe next to the palace is terrific!"

I can only second the rave reviews by a number of other reviewers. Unlike some of the old-fashioned family palaces in Rome, where pictures are hung traditional style from ceiling to floor, here the hanging is to modern taste, as in a museum. The audio guide is excellent, tying together family history and the art on display. For anyone interested in music, the Mozart and Beethoven scores are priceless. Since the Prague castle and its sites is more than OK but much less interesting than the Vienna castle complex, a trip to Prague without visiting the Lobkowicz Palace would be a real mistake. And the family/dynastic history you'll be exposed to here will make -- for instance -- the Cescki Krumlov palace that much more \"historically\" accessible and understandable. Wish we had had the time to try the cafe. This palace is on the route for river cruises, it appears. Enjoy."

We almost didn't go into the Lobkowicz Palace, which is just down Golden Lane behind St Vitus Cathedral - but decided to take a look almost on a whim, and were so very pleased that we did. The family was once among the richest in Europe, but had their possessions seized not once but twice (first by the Germans, and then again by the Soviets); after the fall of the USSR they had the chance to apply to the Czech Government for restitution of their property, and did so successfully in the 1990s - but with the property came the responsibility to restore and preserve it, and the programme to do so is ongoing. This story in itself (as told in the audioguide by the current owner, William Lobkowicz) is interesting enough to make a visit worthwhile - and there are some marvellous paintings, including a Breughel and 2 Canalettos - but the room which for us turned this tour into an emotional and unforgettable experience is the music room. There you can learn about the 7th Prince Lobkowicz - one of the most influential art patrons of his time - and see original scores for pieces produced under his patronage, including Beethoven symphonies and Mozart's reworking of Handel's Messiah. There are regular lunchtime concerts at the Palace - we didn't go, but had the pleasure of hearing much of the music anyway as we took our tour. We didn't go into the cafe, but it looks nice and has been well reviewed by other people. Highly recommended."

The Old Royal Palace was closed for renovations. The Royal Treasury was outrageously priced. The gardens were either closed or just lacking in any blooms given the early season. The Golden Lane was a commercial travesty. Fortunately, right next door to the Golden Lane was the hidden gem of the entire Prague Castle complex: the Lobkowicz Palace. It's a true family business - the only difference is that it's a former royal family. The greeting and instructions I received as I paid my admission were so warm and genuine, as if being invited into someone's home. They even apologized in advance for \"darker-than-usual\" lighting in the Beethoven room, and gave a 50 Kc credit at the gift shop as an apology (no minimum purchase required).The key component of the tour is the audioguide that is included in the admission price. English-speakers are in for a treat, as the narration is done by the American-born heir William Lobkowicz who returned to the Czech Republic in the 90s to reclaim the property his family had to abandon to escape Communist occupation. As you tour the museum, William recounts his family history as a multi-faceted love story: love between the various ruling couples, love between family and country. Many members of the Lobkowicz family played prominent roles in Czech history. Were they the key players? No, but their presence is interspersed throughout the country's and city's history, and after you leave the museum, you will start to put the pieces together and place this family within the overall historical context.I took the \"express\" tour using the audio guide for only the highlighted exhibits. This took about an hour. Highlights included the Bruegel masterpiece \"Haymaking\" and the original scores by Beethoven and Handel written in their own hand! Towards the end of the tour I added a few non-highlighted exhibits, especially all those narrated by other members of the Lobkowicz family. The pride they express for their family and their country is inspiring.When I return to Prague, I will come back to the Lobkowicz Palace and take the complete audioguide-driven tour, and have lunch at what's supposed to be an excellent caf\u00e9. I only wish I had the chance to meet William (who is reported to scoop ice cream at the caf\u00e9 on some days) and congratulate him on establishing such a wonderful museum.The only slight disappointment is that there was no way to photograph the breathtaking balcony view.The tour ends in the gift shop, where I used that coupon to buy a few nice souvenirs. I wish that gift shop were located closer to the city, as I had wanted to return to it because it had such a good selection of tasteful items at reasonable prices.All in all, this was my favourite museum in Prague. I recommend that you consider spending an hour or two here to wait out line-ups to the cathedral. You will not be disappointed."

Zuzana, our enthusiastic and informative tour guide did a spectacular job of hosting our group. Definitely ask for her when you take the tour. We would recommend having lunch after the concert, not before. Soothing classical music in a warm concert hall after dining and a savory shot of Becherovka - a Czech liqueur made of herbs and spices, litterally Becher Bitter - made for a sudden onset of nappy time.

One could view the cover page of Beethoven's Eroica, but the visit would have been more rewarding if I could have seen the first page with music notation in Beethoven's own handwriting (which could have been possibly supplemented with a facsimile of the cover page).

There are two exceptions, three nice paintings, one painted by Breugel and two paintings made in London and which shows London from one side of the river Thames. All the other stuff is nice, but not that special, unless you haven't seen anything from that period before.Still you won't feel cheated when entering this museum, it is worth the money, so do go and visit.

The Lobkowicz dynasty were princes and other high nobility in Bohemia (Prague and surrounding area) from the 14th Century until the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of World War One. As you can imagine, they had the opportunity to buy or commission all sorts of great works of art.Although the First Czechoslovak Republic abolished the nobility, the Lobkowicz were supporters of the democratic state, which meant they had to flee when Nazi Germany invaded in 1939. They had to flee again when the Communist Government confiscated their possessions in 1948. After the collapse of the Soviet bloc, they maneuvered successfully to regain their possessions. I guess that the offer to put so many of them on display and to open their palaces to the public were part of the negotiations.So now, we get to see how the Bohemian 0.00001% lived, their portraits, even the Beethoven score they commissioned and which is dedicated to the then-reigning Prince.The English audio guide is by the American-born heir to the Lobkowicz title and his explanation of the art tied to the family history is a must, even for those who generally skip such guides.Highly recommended."

There were hardly any other visitors at all (this was in October). The audio guide was simply the best we ever heard. The narration was interesting and personal as it is narrated by the actual owners. The artwork is lovely. My favorite room was the instrument room that had a handwritten score of Mozart's instrumentation of Handel's Messiah, as well as hand edited scores of Beethoven's Symphony no 5 and the Eroica. The whole tour took us about an hour during which time the children never got bored and enjoyed going from number to number.

The story of the Lobkowicz family begins in the 15th century and is fascinating all the way, including their surprising return to Prague from the US in the 1990's. The family have been patrons and supporters of the arts, and the collection includes gorgeous paintings and decorative arts, plus original manuscripts from Mozart and Beethoven. The audio guide is done by family members and enhances one's enjoyment of this exquisite building."

The story is fascinating and the treasures on display are incredible, both for their historical and artistic value, as well as the fact that they are still all intact in spite of the turbulent changes of possession through Naziism and Communism.

The concert hall is stunning, small and intimate.The musicians (piano and viola) were very accomplished and played a wonderful mix of classical pieces. It was a unique experience. Following the concert we spent hours in the museum. Fascinating collection and family history enhanced by the excellent audiotour."

The story of the palace is amazing and the Lobkowicz family does a great job of interweaving their family story/history together with the art, furniture, and historical items together (the audioguide is narrated by the current heirs).We enjoyed our tour so much that we went back the next day to attend an outstanding piano and violin concert at the Palace.

This was by far one of the most interesting highlights of my visit to the Prague, and it surprises me how many people seem to pass it by. While crowds were swarming in other areas of the Prague Castle grounds, I was able to tour the Palace on a weekday morning with just a few other visitors. The audio tour is excellent, and the Lobkowicz family's story and historical connection to Prague and to music is fascinating. I spent a considerable amount of time alone in the music room viewing the original Beethoven manuscripts in the family's collection -- which would be a major attraction if they were exhibited in any of the more famous museums around the world. I also attended the lunch time concert and took advantage of the discount offered for lunch in the Palace cafe -- both of which were a nice retreat from the hustle and bustle of the long list of tourist sites in Prague. If you have a few hours, this is well worth a visit."

            "review": "A personal perspective on history. This museum traces the history of the Lobkowicz family over about 500 years. They were princes with high offices in the Hapsburg government so were in the center of political events. They were also patrons of the arts. The museum is in their former palace, at the edge of the castle complex. The museum's artifacts include family portraits that identify the roles of the individuals in history, musical manuscripts (Beethoven, Handel as reorchestrated by Mozart), musical instruments, firearms and armour, artwork including a Brueghel painting and two Canalettos, as well as dinner service, paintings of the family's dogs, and more. William Lobkowicz narrates an audio tour in English (other languages are available) in a pleasant, unpretentious, and informative voice. What makes this museum unique is that it personalizes history through the experiences of a family. Most museums focus on history OR art OR houses, but this one embraces the full experiences of living and helps one put the facts of history together. I especially liked a picture of Princess Polyxena showing the survivors of the second Prague \"defenestration.\" She may have hidden them in her ample skirts! A humanizing touch was to hear William's father tell of riding his bicycle in the long halls of another grand family palace. The family lost all of these treasures first to the Nazis and then to the Communists, but when they got them back in the 1990s, they decided to share them with the world. What a gift to us. The admission fee is reasonable (about $10 US dollars in 2013, including the audio tour--the concert would add a little more). Combining this visit with other experiences: (So much travel info focuses on one site but not on how to piece things together; the combination that follows worked in terms of locations and variety for a full day.)My husband and I had a great (though ambitious) day beginning by walking from Josefov across Manesuv Bridge (one north of Charles Bridge, near the Rudolfinum hall), then up a couple of blocks to a walking path to the castle. Lobkowicz Palace is the first place in the castle complex entering from the east (Jirska Street). After our museum visit (about 1.5 hours), we enjoyed lunch at the Palace cafe (great views of the city as well as good food). Then we walked through the castle grounds and descended from the other side to walk to St Nicholas Church, an amazing example of the Baroque, took a little detour to the small church on Karmelitsca Street that houses the Infant Jesus of Prague (a gift of the Lobkowicz family), then to the Kafka Museum (quite different), then across the Charles Bridge. Lots of steps and a full day, but each thing we saw was amazing, and walking gave us a feel of the city. (We had spent time in the castle and St. Vitus Cathedral the previous day and didn't pause there.)"

In preparation for our recent trip to Prague, we listened to an interesting Rick Steves free podcast in which he interviews William Lobkowicz about the history of his family and the creation of this palace museum (titled \"American Nobleman in Prague\"). It led us to visit the museum, and we really enjoyed it. The audio guide provided to every visitor, also narrated by William Lobkowicz and his family, gives a real personal touch to the exhibits. For example, in addition to portraits of many Lobkowicz ancestors, there are two wonderful paintings of 18th century London by Canaletto, that were acquired by a young Lobkowicz prince when he was there at that time. I was particularly fascinated by the story of the original musical scores for several Beethoven symphonies that had been dedicated by Beethoven to a Lobkowicz ancestor who was his patron. I found that these and similar histories brought to life many of the paintings and objects in a way that you do not find in most museums. The palace also has a very nice terrace cafe with a great view over the city. At 1:00 every day there is a musical concert, for a separate admission fee, that is held in one of the palace's halls."

The audio guide is very easy to use, features beautiful background music and the most important display items are highlighted so you can skip to the most interesting bits of the collection if you are short on time (however, I would recommend listening through all of it).

My poor Grandma kept falling asleep during the musical performance because it was SO incredibly hot in the room. And she loves musical performances. I felt bad for the musicians. They were wonderful and it was a great performance. The views from the balcony of Prague were great as well. The museum was pretty good - Amazing to see original work from Beethoven, Haydn and Mozart. That was the highlight to me. It was hard to enjoy other parts because it was just so hot. I'm sure we would have taken more time to look at the exhibits if it was cooler. I'd go back if I had more time to learn more about Czech history - I think we were overloaded with facts and information and it was hard to keep it straight.

It was my favorite Prague attraction.Classic music fans may recognized the Lobkowicz name as that of the patron of not only Beethoven, but also (at times) Mozart and Handel. On top of seeing original symphonic scores in Mozart's and Beethovens' own hands, the museum is an incredibly interesting look at the history of a Czech aristocratic family. The family had their possessions stripped away twice - once by the Nazis and once by the Communists - only to be returned to them two generations later. The museum is eclectic housing paintings, china, a variety of martial arms, musical instruments, and other accoutrements of Czech noble life. A free audio tour is included with admission, and is incredibly informative and at times quite funny."

There is a first rate free audio guide with the admission actually narrated by the present Lobkowicz in an entertaining manner covering the key art and ceramic collections in the museum. We highly recommend also attending the daily 1 pm music performance performed in a beautiful room in the museum. Its a one hour show of classical music and well worth it. Combine this museum with a visit to the cathedral and castle and you have a whole day of sightseeing!"

The artwork and artifacts are decent, but I enjoyed most the audio tour, narrated by William Lobkowicz, that runs through his family history and gives a personal touch to everything you see. It's fun, friendly, and very well done. It's got portraits, porcelain, original musical scores (and instruments), scenery paintings, watercolor-and-feather bird paintings, dog portraits, etc.The full audio tour is 90 minutes, but the \"greatest hits\" is less than 30, and of course you can stay and linger to look at things and read signs. I was in a rush and had to be out in less than 60 minutes, which was very doable (especially since 2 rooms were closed for a concert), but I would have loved to stay longer."

There is almost no relevant information about Czech history.So now they are just a wealthy family which owns a lot of property around Prague and charges tourists a high price to see their \"dog portraits\" (I mean it, there are portraits of the family dogs. Really.)Yes, that is a real survival history, it is really hard to imagine how they are able to survive with only a couple of castles, some paintings and a \"museum\". I am glad I paid a high price for the entrance ticket, at least now they will be able to buy some food.I am giving two stars instead of one because of the original manuscripts by great composers.

In fact, we enjoyed our visit to Lobkowicz Palace more than any other venue within the castle complex with the exception of St. Vitus Cathedral.Built in the 16th century for the Pernstejn family & acquired & rebuilt (after a fire) in the 17th century by the Lobkowicz family, the excellent audio tour guides you through the fascinating history of the palace and the Lobkowicz family. After losing their properties to both the Nazis and the Communists, the palace was finally returned to the Lobkowicz family in 2002 & was lovingly restored. Don\u2019t miss the magnificent frescoed hall & the 17th century chapel (dedicated to St. Wenceslas) as well as the collection of guns & rare musical instruments.Among the items I found most interesting in the Lobkowizc collection are two magnificent paintings of London by Canaletto, the Hay Harvest by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (one of only 5 remaining landscapes of the \u201cmonths\u201d cycle), the original manuscript of Beethoven\u2019s Eroica Symphony (dedicated by Beethoven to Prince Franz Joseph Maximilian Lobkowicz) as well as manuscripts of Beethoven\u2019s 4th & 5th symphonies, the original manuscript of Mozart\u2019s re-orchestration of Handel\u2019s Messiah, and the beautiful porcelain displays.The caf\u00e9 offers gorgeous panoramic views overlooking Prague and afternoon concerts (held daily at 1:00 pm) are held in the magnificently restored Concert Hall.All in all, a winner!!Note: You do NOT have to purchase Prague Castle tickets to visit Lobkowicz Palace.You can purchase Palace concerts tickets (340 \u2013 440 czk) at the following site:http://www.prague-castle-concert.cz/en/book-now/date-and-seats-selection/Location: Ji\u0159sk\u00e1 3 - Located at the eastern gate of the Prague Castle complex.Tram 22 to Pra\u017esk\u00fd hrad or Metro A to Malostransk\u00e1 & walk up the castle steps.Open: 10:00 am to 6:00 pmAdmission: Adults: 275 CZK /Seniors: 200 CZK (audio guide included in price of admission)Concert Admission: Dependent on seat selection, 340 \u2013 440 czk.

The terrace in the coffee shop is one of the best places to enjoy an amazing view of Prague while enjoying some great coffee. The collection of art is amazing. The family's history, as told through the collection, is truly fascinating. Well worth the cost of admission."

Expansive family wealth, property taken, and family possessions/property reclaimed. Appreciated audio guide included in the price of admission (voices of curator, prince and his wife - information was clearly articulated). As stated in audio guide artwork is not gallery worthy due to years of exposure but many were still lovely, nonetheless. In addition to artwork - interesting collection of firearms, china, musical instruments, etc. Favorite tour offered among other Prague Castle structures. Enjoyed goulash lunch for two on the caf\u00e9 terrace with wine and coffee. pleasant wait staff and what a view!"

The Lobkowicz princes, all nobles loyal to the king of Bohemia, loved to travel, entertain, and collect treasures. Whether you are interested in weapons, musical instruments and manuscripts, art, china, tapestries, interior design, the Palace has it all. Where else could you see Mozart and Beethoven manuscripts in one room and three original Canelettos of London in the next room. There is also an excellent Cafe with great views of Prague at the end of your tour."

The museum has a lot of family memorabilia (portraits etc. but also ceramics) and about 3 or 4 remarkable paintings by renowned artists (Cranach, Breughel etc.). I was a little disappointed because there is so much hype about this museum and not much inside. The museum doesn't compare, for example, with the Czartoryski in Cracow. The view from the Lobkowicz Cafe is NOT the best view of Prague, this is what your American guidebook will be telling you but please ignore."

This happened to the Lobkowicz family. Forced to walk away to escape the Nazis, they got their holdings back after WWII only to lose them again to the Communists. When the iron curtain lifted they had a year to catalogue and establish title to what had been confiscated from them. Not only did they do this, but they also opened this palace and another to the public. The ongoing involvement of a princely family sharing their heritage with the public is a gift to the wider community that we appreciated. We enjoyed the audio guide, which was easy to operate, and were absorbed by the anecdotes told by family members.

The family has collected art for centuries, and most of their collection is now in this palace. The collection includes major works by Velasquez, Cranach, and Brueghel. However excellent the paintings, there's an additional attraction. That's the amazing story of a wealthy and powerful family that has survived endless wars and conquests. Touring the palace is a way to see great art, and also learn about Czech history and the Czech ability to persevere."

Whilst visiting Prague Castle we came across the Lobkowicz Palace and its amazing private collection of family photographs, fine art, paintings, furniture and arms all beautifully and carefully displayed in this small family Palace. We learned more about the history of Prague and the Cheque Republic here than any other museum and were mesmerised by the works of art which had survived wars, Nazi occupation and the Communist Regime. A real treat was attending a lunchtime concert in the family Grand Entertaining Room, a selection of classical music arranged for piano and viola, including Albinoni's Adagio, Beethoven, Smetana and Khachaturian. It was also our great pleasure to meet the charming owner, William Lobkowicz, who is often in the Palace promoting children's workshops and community events. Also has a lovely restaurant with amazing views from the terrace looking out over the whole of the city. Suitable for all the family. Oh and of course, the Beethoven and Mozart original manuscripts make your pulse race!"

Alternative to trek up numerous steps to castle precincts from town is a 22 tram to Prazky hrad aka Prague Castle main entrance. If you time it right, you can see the noon changing of the guard, and take in the 1 o'clock concert in the Palace. Don't normally bother with audio guides but worth it, as commentary by crrent owner, who we saw in the cafe which I thought was good value considering the location. Funny to see two such beautiful paintings of my home town (London) in this setting, but lots of musical, artistic and political connections."

The Lobkowicz family themselves narrate the tour, and it's told in a very thoughtful and personal way. I was blown away. I highly recommend it. Another interesting thing to note is that since I was taking my 6 year old, we had to cancel some of the tours that I originally planned for simply because he wasn't up for it. One of the tours I had to let go of was the Communism and Nuclear Bunker Tour, and I was kind of bummed because I really wanted him to learn about it. This tour at the Lobkowicz Palace, however, taught him so much about communism that I no longer felt bad for missing the other tour. It also made it more personal. I loved this audio tour."

One room has paintings of the families dogs and dog collars that look like they would fit around someone's waist! The audio guide is great and narrated by two generations of the family who tell lots of detail and share stories. While it looks small, I spent over an hour going through.

If you are a music lover there are music manuscripts by Hayden, Mozart and Beethoven, that were signed or written in the composers own handwriting. 3.

They provide a 10% off coupon with entry. There is indoor and outdoor seating5. Free concert with admission. Performed in a hall where other musical greats have performed6. You need to go to use the Water Closet at the museum. There are pictures of William and his family with many dignitaries along the hall way toward the WC... Barbara Bush is in a lot of pictures there...funny7. You need to look out the windows to see the beautiful view of Old Town below. I took a picture out the window, it was that nice."

This was no mean task.They hired the best lawyer they could access and literally had to scout and identity hundreds of works of art ,ceramics and priceless collection from many places across the country within that short year ! Very impressive history and well explained with audio guide.I think private tours have to be booked.The gift shop was impressive with very good quality items and memorabalia.Well wirth the visit and very close to Prague Castle!"

I didn't plan to go to the Lobkowicz Palace when I visited the Prague Castle,but then I realised it hosts a collection of musical instruments and autograph manuscripts by many of the greatest composers of the 18th and early 19th centuries, including Beethoven and Mozart, which really interested me.I'm so glad I did!The Lobkowicz collection is the oldest and largest privately owned art collection in the Czech Republic, I really enjoyed seeing the artefacts and the audio tour, in particular paintings and the music archive.Before my trip to Prague I booked a couple of evening concerts, when I visited Lobkowicz Palace I realised that the palace hosts concerts as there was one taking place during my visit. Such a shame that I hadn't realised this sooner I think it'd be a wonderful experience enjoying a concert in this delightful setting. If you're interested in European History and history of art you'd be fascinated by this place, the admission is even higher than Prague Castle but personally think it's worth it."

The audiotape is a must. William Lobkowicz narrates with the help of his wife and his parents. You will learn the loss and recovery of the palace and the assets twice in the past century."

It's a lovely, private palace on the grounds of the Prague Castle, owned by a family who had managed to reclaim their private property both after WWII and after the fall of Communism. Highlight is definitely the original scores of Mozart and Beethoven. Since it is not part of the Castle/Government property, the entrance fee to the castle doesn't include entrance to this particular palace, indicating that the money is going towards the upkeep of this private palace. It is a bit odd that they then ask their guests on the audio recording for help to restore this essentially private property. While it is a lovely historic landmark, as a tourist I found it rather offputting to be asked to help this obviously wealthy family refurbish one of their palaces. Kind of left this otherwise glorious building with a sour taste in my mouth."

Having lost all of their possessions twice, to the Nazi's and the Communist regime, in 1992 they regained all their properties, I think partly because everything was well-documented. The current Lobkowicz family does an outstanding job bringing this history to life in the museum, the only building that is privately owned in Hradcany, the Prague castle. A wonderful part of the tour is the storytelling using the audio equipment. The story unfolds through the voice of the youngest Lobkowicz descendant, US born but moved with family back to Czech to undergo this incredible adventure. Three rooms stuck with me: the room with etchings - all by the same artist - of all the Lobkowicz palaces, the room with the pictures of birds using real feathers, and - being from Holland - the room with various dinner sets, including a Delft Blue one. Well done!"

They have the original manuscripts which are amazing to see!The palace also offers nice views of the city.

Although we got to see amazing portraits, Mozart and Beethovens original scipts, grand collections and works of historical importants, these items seemed to merely serve the purpose of peripheral detailes that to the Lobkowicz. Instead, the exhibition took on a story about a family, their hardships and how they found back to their roots. This experience was as much impressive and beautiful as it was humbling."

That would have been enough, but we still had the tour, which was absolutely wonderful. I strongly recommend a palce visit when in Prague!!!"

One can visit countless beautiful and interesting sites, but having Will Lobkowicz tell about his ancestors as if he knew them well, and relate their lives to those of his family today, makes this a most personal and memorable experience. My 11 year old son (full of energy and short on patience) listened intently through the entire tour and still comments on what he saw and learned. The weapons, extensive musical display, cheeseburger and guards outside the palace were most impressive to this tween. (His most frequent story while recounting our two weeks of European travel was telling friends how he had a cheeseburger for lunch on Thanksgiving--in a castle with a Prince!.) The Palace Cafe features Czech fare, salads (hard to come by in Prague) as well as . . . the cheeseburger, American style. The gift shop is also better than most."

Being on a city like Prague, is like visiting Salzburg or Venezia: you'll breath culture everywhere.I've never had before the opportunity to visit the Lobkowitz Palace, and this time I did.What a precious hidden gem! Not so easy for a person at my age to climb the steps or the ramp to get there, but once we did, we felt the prize was more than deserved. This private collection, very carefully curatored by members of the Lobkowitz family, offers visitors the opportunity to explore the history of Europe through the unique perspective of The Lobkowicz Collections and the Lobkowicz family. Set in 22 beautifully appointed galleries, this lovely Museum displays a selection of some of the finest pieces from the collections, including many of international significance. Ushered through the galleries by the museum's audio guide, which explains important facts of European history and the six-hundred-year history of the Lobkowiczes, including the dramatic story of how the family lost everything twice and got it back - twice, is narrated by two generations of Lobkowiczes and the Chief Curator himself.By 1:00 pm, we'd previously scheduled a so-called \"Midday Classic Concert\"......and there we go...It was not bad, not at all, but one pianist, sometimes accompanied by a violist, sometimes changing places as first or second instrument for the price of Cz440 (around $22 USA)sounded a little preposterous to me.Like a snack party, we were offered Bach and Vivaldi,Mozart and Beethoven, and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Smetana, ending with a frightening arrangement of Khachatutian's Sabre Dance for piano and viola.Sounds grand, huh?Well, it isn't. Sadly, these masters of Baroque and early 19th century composers, have wrote their pieces under some conditions, hard to change and harder to be listened when brutally rearranged to fit a pair of instruments.Not bad, I repeat, but....strange. I had even thought, seriously, some musicians had not arrived in time. When the first of the duos started, I felt a little bit awkward, uncomfortable. The musicians did their best, each one in her category played skillfully. But the melancholy to realize they KNEW that those pieces were meant to be performed by at least a quartet, had lead me to a sentiment of pity. Yes, I was sorry for my colleagues performing GREAT pieces under so precarious circumstances. All right, it's all part of a plan- the music room, with its amazingly gracious stucco was meant to be a plus, but for those who are serious about music or play some instrument, be warned that the \"Concert\" is almost as sad as a \"One Man Band\". Boy...how expensive it could be to hire a cello, two violins, and a basso? It would sound lovely, fresh and happy, as the end of a wonderful visit should be.The poor musicians would certainly feel much more at ease, playing their score without having to break and suppress whole phrases and countermelodies the way they were forced to do, by mixing one voice with viola and piano, sounding like an aggressive discussion between two instruments, instead of the Estro Armonico every musician seeks."

It's mostly narrated by the current resident, a Lobkowicz himself with the occasional narration from his family. Without the audio guide, it's just a bunch of family portraits, heirlooms, an impressive arms collection, and real written scores by Beethoven and Mozart. But the story is told so well, it really brings meaning and life to the things you see. (Tip: hold the forward/backward buttons to fad forward or rewind)The best part was the music room with a bunch of antique (but used) instruments and incredible original scores by Beethoven and Mozart. And I course the narration provides excellent information.Also impressive were the arms. There are 2 rooms filled with gorgeous guns, both ceremonial and military. Take a closer look to see the detail in the artistry.This place is just at the end of Prague Castle. You can buy a combo ticket and get a discount, although I think you should just do the free parts of Prague Castle. But if you insist on buying a ticket, get the combo ticket."

You will hear stories about their artwork collections, family portraits, ceramics, porcelains, weaponry, and my favorite, musical scores.The musical instruments and original manuscripts by Beethoven and Mozart are truly amazing.

As someone who enjoys history and has limited art knowledge I really enjoyed this.The audio tour really brought the paintings to life as you walked around and heard the family connections to each piece. Not only that you are hearing the story of portrait from the subject's actual descendant.The story of how Lobkowicz Palace and its collections was built up and then taken from the family twice and now reclaimed is interesting and moving.The art collection is impressive and vast.I was also deeply impressed by the music room which had actual music sheets from Beethoven for music he dedicated to Prince Lobkowicz. It really is very impressive to hear a piece of Mozart's re-writing of Handel's Messiah through the audio tour whilst looking at the actual music sheet with his handwriting on it.As a bonus for us, when we left one of the many rooms we actually bumped into Mr Lobkowicz himself, who narrates you through the tour. He was very nice and seemed genuinely pleased to meet us and hear how we enjoyed the palace.I really could not recommend a visit to this attraction any higher. It is hugely impressive and the audio tour will make it interesting for everyone, even those that do not particularly enjoy art or history museums.Also, when finished, go next door to the cafe and have a lovely Apple Strudel whilst enjoying a beautiful view of Prague."

My wife and I both enjoyed this witty and personal touch in describing the exhibits.My wife and I have fairly different interests and we both found the varied holdings presented on the two floors of this well maintained and signed museum had great interest to both of us. If one only had 30 minutes to visit this museum and your main interests are painting and music one can visit the dozen \"highlight stops\" enumerated by the audioguide rather than going through the 30+ stops that constitute the entire tour.If one makes the effort to visit Prague Castle I think that visiting Lobkowicz Palace is a \"no brainer\"!"

The tour begins with an audio guide narrated by the current Prince Lobkowicz \u00a0who along the way introduces his father and wife who take us through the many beautiful rooms of their palace loaded with family portraits and artifacts that describe 500+ years of their family's history and contributions to the arts. \u00a0They were patrons of many artists and the collection includes some of the original scores from Beethoven and Mozart right in front of our eyes. The acid test for enjoyment was that all of us were actually wanting more after traipsing through 3 floors for 2 hours listening to Prince Lobkowicz tell us of his wonderful family. We note that the Lobkowicz Cafe is listed as a wonderful place to have lunch and indeed it was eating in a courtyard in the middle of the courtyard, tres chic."

It contains the story of one of Europe's most aristocratic families and it's place in history. It tells how the Lobkowicz family lost their priceless collection first to the Nazis, got it back and then lost it again during the post-war communist era, finally to regain it again upon the new dawn in Czechoslovakia heralded by the velvet revolution of 1989. There are priceless exhibits including paintings by Canaletto and manuscripts by composers such as Beethoven and Mozart. I would strongly recommend the audio guide (available in English) to gain a full appreciation of this amazing collection. Allow at least 2 hours to go round the entire exhibition."

Don't forget to show your student card to get the discount even if you don't study in Czech Republic. We listened to every background information while wandering around the rooms and exhibits. The fact that you actually listen to Lobkowicz family members telling their story and background information as well as other historical figures' stories makes the tour even more enjoyable. Beethoven's original manuscripts of the 3rd, 5th and 6th symphonies are some of the noteable exhibits of the museum although I loved the whole collection of paintings, porcelain and ceramics too. The view from the museum windows is stunning therefore do have a look while wandering through the rooms."

Someone should make a movie about the family history, about how everything they had was confiscated, and then retrieved, twice! Go visit the palace and see this for yourselves. It is well worth the time. In June 2012, we visited the Palace and Museum and took the self-guided audio tour (our teenage girls were enthralled), attended the intimate chamber concert and had lunch on the caf\u00e9 terrace overlooking Prague \u2013 one of the best views you\u2019ll ever see.

No more! This was the best attraction of our Prague visit. This family had been Czech princes for generations: clearly smart, politically astute, very rich, and tastefully acquisitive until fleeing the Nazis (the Lobkowicz of the time being vehemently opposed) and leaving everything. After having their lands and possesions returned after WWII, the Communist regime confiscated them all again. With the fall of that regime, they returned and the present Lobkowicz heir, who it seems had lived all his life in the US, brought his young family back to the palace and has transformed it into a non-profit world-class museum, with his own family narrative to accompany you (the audio-guide is a must). You move from a room of Canaletto's views of London to one of the 5 remaining parts of Brueghel's seasons, to Mozart's original score of his arrangement of Handel's Messiah, all within a perfect restoration of the living rooms for the palace. Amazing! You can buy a ticket for the Palace in combo with the Cathedral (also not to be missed), but it seemed to us that this was only advertised at the museum itself. We were so lucky our walking tour guide the previous day insisted it was the best thing at the castle. It is. Also has a lovely caf\u00e9 where you can drink Lobkowicz beer (what else?), look down over the whole city, and enjoy a delicious lunch.They also have restored one of their palaces in the country to exhibit more of their stuff: a definite for our next Czech visit."

The building was old but inside was lightness and colour. We took a self-conducted audio tour. We could have added a midday concert but after looking at many flyers offering \u2018classical concerts\u2019 that were nothing more than extracts for tourists, I was getting a little suspicious about what the offering might have been. As it turned out we did not miss much as the Lobowicz collection is something quite astonishing. The first rooms are full of family portraits dating back to the late 16th century. The family made its mark by being high level civil servants at the court of the King of Bohemia and marrying well into the Spanish Hapsburgs. Over the centuries their wealth and prestige grew until 1939. Then the Nazis took over and sequestered the lot. After the war, the prince came back home, only to see his property disappear again after the Communist coup of 1949. He fled to the USA. Only after the fall of Communism and the passing of an Act of Restitution was the family able to recover what it had lost.In subsequent rooms there are wonderful collections of china, glass, weapons and dogs. It was in the music room that I was completely entranced. During the early 18th century the then Prince was a patron of Mozart. On display is the manuscript of Mozart\u2019s orchestration of Handels\u2019s Messiah in his own handwriting. Next to it are original scores of Beethoven\u2019s 4th and 5th symphonies, again with the composer\u2019s own notes thereon. I had already admired a Lucas Cranach the Elder painting and a Brueghel but I walked into the next room and there were two astonishing Canalettos, acquired when one of the Princes was dwelling in London at the same time as the artist was there. (mid 18th century) One is somewhat familiar with St Pauls dominating the river pageant of Lord Mayor\u2019s Day. The viewpoint of other was Lambeth Palace with the old palace of Westminster in the centre and over to the left a large building about where Victoria station now stands with four slender towers at each corner. There was also a Piranesi Room with engravings of Rome of that artist. We went downstairs to the caf\u00e9 had a very pleasant lunch in graceful surroundings. At \u00a320 it was a bit pricey but we paid for the surroundings, I guess."

This palace is part of the Prague Castle complex, but since it is owned and run by a family rather than the state, it is far more interesting than most of the complex. Every day there is a concert at 1pm. The day we attended was the first day of a new program. For an hour, we listened to three very fine musicians play Czech music. We heard a piano, a viola and a flute in various combinations and solos. The room is not large, does not fill up, and the acoustics are good. The museum audio guide, included in the admission price, features a family member explaining highlights of the collections. Aside from interesting family portraits, there are some real treasures. The best piece is the glorious painting \"Haymaking\" by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. It alone is worth the price of admission, and since this museum is uncrowded it is possible to enjoy it in peace.mThere are also two wonderfully detailed and very large paintings of the Thames in London by Canaletto. The family's history is a window into the upheavals of this century. The current family members worked to regain their property after having lost it twice, once to the Nazis and again to the Communists. They are justifiably proud of their family history of supporting the arts, and of having kept their property in Czech lands at times when other aristocratic families took their treasures to safer countries like Austria or Germany. The cafe is very nice, and the cafe terrace has wonderful views over the city. I would visit this palace any time I went to Prague, whereas omce was enough for seeing the state-run parts of the castle complex."

Round it out with hand corrected music from Motzart and Beethoven and you have a greet small museum!The cafe serves up a hood luck with a beautiful view if you're hungry."

Food is very tasty and well presented, and once you have recharged your batteries, visit their shop which sells many items exclusively produced for the Lobkowicz family.There is an hour long classical concert performed by professional musicians daily at 1pm too.

You can see the delicate silver woven in his robe. This is a sign of great wealth\". Or \"Look at the large emerald ring on my ancestors finger. On special occasions, my mother still wears that ring today\". Or, \"Its a proud thought for me to know that it was my great great grandfather who made it possible for Beethoven to write the 5th symphony\". There was even a section in the museum on their pet dogs which Mr. Lobkowich mother emphasized were \"portraits\" in that you could tell which dog what which. Seeing that the Lobkowichs are so rich, why in the world am I paying to go inside their palace? I'm making them even wealthier."

Whether it's just for a lunch break or a tour of the best museum in Prague, you must visit the Lobkowicz Palace. The Palace is the ancestral home of the Lobkowicz family dating back to the Middle Ages. Ejected from these holdings, the family was welcomed back to restore the former glory, and make it into a commercial tourist attraction. They have succeeded! Even if it costs a bit more, you must take lunch (and enjoy a bottle of wine) at the veranda over looking the city. It you tour the museum the audio tour feels like the Prince is walking with you. I call this the most can't miss stop in Prague."

I'm really surprised at seeing all these extremely positive reviews here on Tripadvisor since I still laugh out loud each time something reminds me of our visit to the Lobkowicz Palace. First of all, the entrance fee was really, really expensive if compared to other (much better!) museums around the world: this is not the Louvre or the Uffizi, and the price immediately made me suspicious. We came here mainly to see the Infanta Margarita by Velasquez, and after a few minutes stroll through the rooms we quickly decided to skip almost everything else. Family portraits, pictures of the Lobkowicz ancestors' birds and dogs... who cares?!The audio commentary doesn't focus much on the pieces of art, it mainly talks about the family's history (how great their ancestors were, how much they suffered...) trying to move visitors to tears, which in my opinion was really irritating and completely inadequate. Someone else already pointed it out in previous reviews, which comforts me.This museum certainly offers things of interest (Velasquez, some Canalettos, Brueghel...etc), I'm not denying it, but all in all there's not enough here to justify the high entrance fee. It's a rip-off and having to listen to each tiny detail of the family's \"glorious\" history really made me feel even more cheated! NOT recommended!"

In the beautiful city of Prague, there are so many places to visit and so much history to indulge in ... but best of all, I believe, is the Lobkowicz Palace and Collections. Situated high above the Vltava River and Mala Strana, gazing out over the Charles Bridge, the Lobkowicz Collections are situated in the Lobkowicz Palace, inside the Prague Castle grounds. From historical portraits to an extensive collection of centuries of weapons, to famed landscape paintings to the astounding musical scores of Beethoven and Mozart -- the Collections are impeccably done and are beautifully narrated on the audio tour. Highly highly recommended. A must-see and must-tour while in Prague!"

I was given an audio guide (included in the ticket) and was guided around by the voices of the current Lobkowicz family. Each room has a theme and story to tell. keep your eyes out for the laminated descriptions of all the items in the room which are usually inconspicous in the corner. As I am still a young boy at heart I really enjoyed the antique weapons and armour room and was totally impressed in the music room to discover sheet music hand edited by Mozart and Bethoven! It was nice to discover that this family was the financial backing allowing some of these great musicans the time to create without worrying where their next meal was coming from.I didn't give full marks mainly for 2 reasons. The first was because I left with mixed emotions from the audio guide. I appreciated the personal touch and emotion the current family get accross in the guide however it's a delicate balance not to be disliked for being lucky or convince the listener the hardship the inheritance has cost and is costing. Similar to a friend winning the lottery and then complaining about the price of gas to fill his 8 cars and private plane. I think the guide would be better served with narration by the currator with little exerpts from the family to improve the experience.The other reason for not getting full marks is not entirely fair but it is what it is. I returned to London England a few days later and took my father to the Wallace Collection. This reminded me so much of the Lobkowicz Palace it was uncanny. Both wealthy familys who spent generations collecting wonderful things but the Wallace Collection was a level above and free. It set the benchmark and showed the differece between a 4 vs a 5.All this said and I am just glad there are people still out there who will devote themselves to collecting wonderful things, preserving history, and sharing them with the public.Please go as I'm sure your admission cost is going towards further restoration."

It's narrated by William Lobkowicz (b. 1961), who grew up in the Boston area after his family left Prague when the Russians took over after WWII. He gives a very generous and personal guide to the exhibits. The story of his family pretty much encompasses the story of European nobility from the renaissance to the present. My wife and I were almost alone in the museum, even though there were the usual crowds outside in the Castle grounds. Rooms full of family portraits, some fine, some mediocre ((but with interesting histories). Some really nice landscapes and Pieter Bruegel the Elder's \"Haymaking\", worth a trip by itself. Also, Beethoven's original orchestral score for the Pastoral Symphony (I think). Beethoven dedicated the 3rd (Eroica), the 5th, and the 6th (Pastoral) symphonies to a Lobkowicz family member, Prince Joseph Franz Maximilian, a great patron of his. A great music manuscript and instrument collection. Also fine historical armaments. All in all, a great place to get away from crowds and soak up old European history."

This prepared us for the extensive collection at this palace. This museum is artfully arranged, full of extremely high quality artifacts, and thoughtfully discussed by the son of the family who are the custodian's of these beautiful things on the audio tour. We were astonished to see several original scores in Beethoven's and Mozart's hands. the commitment to preservation of Czech culture is the paramount mission of this organization.

Visiting the Lobkowicz Palace is like visiting your rich friend who shows you his amazing collection of paintings, guns, ceramics, music collection and other valuables.The price of admission is $275 Kc / person and includes an audio tour, 10% coupon for food at their cafe and a $40 Kc coupon if you spend $300 or more Kc at their gift shop.If you have the time to manage it, you can go for a combination ticket of music and the museum for $590 Kc. Having had heard a concert at the Church of St. Nicholas by Old Town Square, I think I would have preferred listening to a concert here at this palace instead. Music in a church just echoes constantly and really, it sounds like musical diarrhea, although, my wife and many other listeners would probably disagree.Anyway, the palace offers a great collection of interesting things and the entire tour took us almost 3 hours, this is not including taking photos, as you're not allowed to. Every room is different and it's like tasting different foods as you tour. It's a fascinating look at what a wealthy family lived like back in the day.The audio tour is not bad, but if I were to say anything bad about this palace, this would be it. I would have preferred more information on the items on the display. I distinctly remember 2 rooms with a great assortment of weapons and armor but next to nothing on their origins. There must have been a hundred different rifles and handguns, some with exquisite artwork / etchings, but no information about them.There are musical scores or papers or notes that belonged to Beethoven that were briefly touched upon in the audio tour and one is left wanting more. Overall an excellent experience, it only needs a professional curator that can provide more to enrich the experience."

First of all, the reciept from the purchase of tickets for the palace had a statement asking to post a review on trip advisory. Since people tend to respond more if they perceive a positive experience, that is immediately likely to skew overall responses in a positive direction, and I think that can corrupt the usefulness of a site like this.Secondly, the palace is very interesting historically, but on a par with many other sites in this amazing city. There is no such thing as a definite number one in a historically rich destination like Prague. As for specifics, the fixed price lunch available with the ticket was OK, not great.As for the concert, it is total tourist fare. I am a lover of classical music, and I was disturbed by the brief edited versions of significant pieces performed. When I went to Prague 15 years ago, you would find small ensmbles performing complete and interesting works of music. Now these are being condensed to soundbites that give the illusion only of \"serious music\". Unfortunately, this is now prevalent all over the city. Fortunately, the great music festivals and symphonie orchestra persists."

We went to the lunchtime concert and also toured the palace with audioguides, before having a late lunch on the terrace overlooking the city.The concert was ok, lasts 1 hour. the viola player was the most enthusiastic-I wouldn't do this if you are a serious music buff though.Acoustics were good, and it was a pleasant enough hour.The museum is great-we spent 2 hours going around the palace.Every room has a focus, and my husband particulaly liked the amoury room, whilst I preferred the music room, which had original Beethoven scores,and was very informative about this period of musical history.We liked it because each room was different, and we could get a good overview of many things without spending the whole day inside.We also found out about the family's history, and how they came to regain their possessions after the Revolution. The audio guide is narrated by current members of the family.We then had lunch in the palace cafe, out on the terrace overlooking Prague, which was also very enjoyable.A great day, with plenty of variety-and not many people!"

It brought the beautiful artwork to life hearing the stories behind each piece. Among other things, they were patrons to Betoven and encouraged him to make whatever music he wanted. During the 2nd World War,the family left Prague and all their possessions, but were rewarded for their patriotism 50 years later when the Czech Republic welcomed them back and returned their property. You and your family will love this Medieval gem of a city where you expect to see a jousting tournament around every corner and be sure not to miss the Lobkowicz Castle."

I hope people understand that the Lobkowicz clan is of nobility/royalty who had -- and still have -- a tremendous amount of wealth. Compared to what most people went through during the Holocaust and Communism, this family fared extremely well. I hope no one is coming here thinking they are visiting the Anne Frank House.Overall, there are 4-5 paintings inside that are very nice (one of the Infanta Margarita by Velasquez, some Canalettos), but the palace itself is not exactly palatial and I was not moved by the family's story.It was 12 euros as of a few days ago, so I will be emailing Trip Advisor asking them to update the description (which currently says \"free\"). Also, the palace has signs in front advertising it, with one banner saying in big letters something like \"Voted Best Site in Prague!\" -- can you imagine the Louvre or the Musee d'Orsay having something similar?"

The Palace has a WONDERFUL audio tour included in the price of admission that is narrated by the American heir to the Lobkowicz family holdings. The audio tour gave us more insight into this family's experiences in the Czech Republic, flight to America, and return the Czech Republic, than any tour guide or tour book ever could have. It was genuinely inspiring to see how the Lobkowicz family has stewarded their inheritance and is working to preserve their history.

It is really an impressive collection of items and I liked the way that the tour worked with the audio handsets, allowing you to go at your own pace and only learn about the items that interested you. A few things that I noticed differently from some of the other reviews. First, the tour was not free when I went but it is reasonably priced. Second, the audio commentary throughout the tour was mostly talking about the Lobkowicz family instead of the actual artwork/items. I am not sure if that is normal for these types of tours but it was something that I wasn't fond of. I was there to see the collection and hear about the pieces and not learn the entire history of the family that owns it. However, if you have a personal interest in the Lobkowicz history, then you will love this aspect of the audio commentary. Third, finding the Lobkowicz Palace is not easy. I was confident that printing out my trustworthy TripAdvisor printout of the place with the address and information would be a sure way to find the establishment. I was wrong. Most of the locals have no idea what you are referring to if you ask them where \"Lobkowicz Palace\" is located. The people who did offer their help in finding it usually (unintentionally) sent me in the wrong direction because no one refers to this place as \"Lobkowicz Palace\". I even stopped at a nice art shop near Prague castle (0.5km to the south) and the artist who spoke English couldn't tell me how to get there. Luckily, I ended up calling the Lobkowicz on the phone and the staff is very courteous and helpful. It really isn't difficult to find but just don't think that asking the locals will get you there.In the end, I still rate this attraction as very good because it is an interesting tour and even the history of the acquisition (and seizure and subsequent reacquisition) of the artwork is interesting"

If you visit, Google \"William Lobkowicz,\" take a look at his picture, and then look for him at the palace. He is often there and he is such an interesting and charming man. He is a direct descendant of the Lobkowicz royal family and he seems genuinely passionate about the family's collection. He's from the US, so language is not a problem for English speaking tourists. A trip to the palace is lovely, but if you get 15 miutes to chat with William, it will become a visit you remember for a long time because he really makes the place come alive. I also recommend the audio tour. I am not always a fan of these, but this one is well done and is entertaining. The palace is inside the Prague Castle 'complex.' The Castle isn't one building, but rather a collection of buildings behind a fortress wall. If you visit the castle, you have a variety of options for admission, based on the number of buildings you wish to visit. I don't think that the Lobkowicz Palace is part of any of the Castle packages. Most, perhaps all, of the Castle admission packages include entry to the Golden Walk, which is a main street that goes past a variety of properties designed to show you what life was like in Prague a long, long time ago. Most of the shops are hokey, but there are a few gems, including the jail/prison. The Lobkowicz Palace is at the end of the Golden Walk. So if you get a Castle tour package that includes the Golden Walk, this will lead you right to Lobkowicz Palace, making it an ideal place to end your Castle tour. There is a one hour classical concert every day at 1 pm. I've attached a photo that shows the music performed. I recommend arriving at the Castle around 9:30- 10 am, touring on your own and ending around 12:15. This gives you time to have lunch at Lobkowicz Palace or another cafe, followed by the classical concert from 1- 2, which gives you plenty of time to rest your feet and refresh. After the concert, tour the palace for an hour or so, go back to your hotel for a nap, and then have a fabulous evening meal!"

The other remarkable thing about this museum is how empty it is (that really adds to the intimate feel) - I visited right after the concert when you'd expect it to be at its most busy, it wasn't overcrowded even then, and by the time I got to the end it was completely empty (other visitors must have rushed through).The combined concert and museum ticket (audio tour included) was the equivalent of about $30, remarkable value. I did enjoy the concert (I can't say how objectively good it was though, I don't know anything about classical music), but if your time in Prague is very limited, just see the museum, which takes at least a couple of hours to see properly.There's a nice cafe and a small gift shop which sells replicas of some of the family's jewelry, that's such a good idea, I wish it was bigger so I could pick up even more unique stuff whilst supporting a wonderful organization!

My study abroad group had the immense pleasure of talking to the always busy Prince William Lobkowicz or Mr. Lobkowics as he is called in Prague (who did away with titles in past years). The many paintings and exhibits are truly surreal and the classical music concert we got to enjoy was nothing short of spectacular. Theirs is a rich history with many hard times as well as grand times had by their many clearly laid out ancestors. I espicially liked the artillery room but the whole history of the family shown through their extensive artwork is an awesome sight to see. The family does many non-profit benefits, and their entire palace would surely be free if they were not the sole responsible party responsible for the upkeep of their many properties which is very expensive (50,000 a year just to maintain one stucco ceiling in the concert hall). I definetly recommend this to any tourist traveling near it is a great story with many cool exhibits to see for any age."

When visiting the amazing buildings that make up the Prague castle, ensure that you stop and enter the Lobkowicz Palace.The Palace is architecturally magnificent, but what makes this visit so momentous is the story behind the Lobkowicz family that dates back for centuries. William Lobkowicz and his family are responsible for the audio tour that takes you from room to room in the palace. They explain the history and patronage that the family under took over time that culminates in the visitor being able to view original Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven manuscripts, study in detail Rubens, Canelletto and other masterpieces and many more exquisite artefacts.The recent history of the family at the turn of the 20th century through to current times explains the conviscation of their property and lands only to be finally restituted after the end of the cold war and the Czech Velvet Revolution in 1989.Although I live in Prague,I never fail to enjoy a trip to the Palace with friends and family that visit. For me it is the highlight of any tourist trip to Prague - enjoy!"

We wanted to experience the entire Palace and the concert (realizing that we were going to be there on a Saturday afternoon and it could be busy) so we decided to go through the official site and book everything ahead of time so that we would be assured of seats at the concert and so that we wouldn't have to stand in line waiting to buy tickets. With our ticket confirmation number and print out of the credit card transaction in hand we left for Prague. When we arrived at the Palace we noted (as expected) that things were quite crowded. Mistakenly, we got into a short line to receive headphones and when it was our turn and I showed our reservation to the clerk she explained that I would have to stand in line at the cashier's desk. So we got into line at the cashier's desk and waited. When it was our turn I showed our reservation number for the combination package (concert and palace). This clerk said that \"Yes, you have purchased a combination package, but I cannot help you. You need to walk back out to the front of the palace to the entrance where you will find a desk where a clerk has your combination tickets and then come back here to my desk with those tickets. IMAGINE HOW MUCH TIME WE'D WASTED BY NOW STANDING IN LINE BUT THIS WAS JUST THE BEGINNING!Next, we went back out to the front of the palace and found the desk (across from a man selling ice cream). BUT NO ONE WAS AT THE DESK! Behind the desk there was a window with two security people and we wondered if we should ask them if they knew anything about the tickets. Finally a woman comes out from a door behind us (next to the ice cream stand) and we explain that we have purchased a combination package. I show her the print out of the reservation number and the transaction and it takes her some time to understand (as if she is doing this for the very first time in her life). Finally she says \"Yes I think you have a combination package let me get your envelope.\" So she finds our reservation on her information sheet and hands us our combination tickets. \"Please go inside the palace and first show your entrance tickets to the cashier.\" WE HAVE ALREADY STOOD IN TWO LINES AND THEN WALKED BACK OUT TO THE ENTRANCE AND WILL NOW HAVE TO STAND IN THESE SAME TWO LINES ALL OVER AGAIN BUT THAT'S NOT ALL!!When we finally get our real tickets and our headphones we are told that we will only be able to see half of the palace because today there is a special event. So, the bottom half of the palace is closed to the public. \"Then please refund half of the price of our tickets,\" I said. \"I'm sorry we cannot do that because you have purchased a combination package, \" she tells us. \"Then can we come back tomorrow to see the other half then?\" I ask. \"No, because your ticket is a discount ticket,\" she tells us.MORAL OF THE STORY: \"DO NOT BUY THE COMBINATION PACKAGE. IT IS MORE TROUBLE THAN ITS WORTH AND YOU MAY GET RIPPED OFF LIKE WE DID.\""

To begin with the commentary seemed like a rather over- the- top family history but it gradually came to life and we realised just how important this dynasty had been in Prague's history, and what wonderful treasures they had owned. The Cannalettos and the Breughel would alone deserve a visit and I would recommend it to anyone. We also had a bowl of soup in the restaurant and did not find it at all over priced, unlike a previous reviewer.

The palace is within the castle complex, but still privately owned by the Lobkowicz family. The palace requires a separate admission, but is well worth the price. It is a most surprising and eclectic museum, with treasures I didn't even know existed, like two original Canalettos. If you\u2019re tired, and you don\u2019t quite recall anything in Venice looking like that, the signs gently in form you that they\u2019re views of London. Canaletto\u2019s London period was certainly new information for at least one of us.Rarest of all are two manuscripts in the music room, amongst a rather impressive collection of instruments \u2013 the first is an original hand-written Mozart score for his rewrite of Handel\u2019s Messiah. Neither of us realized that Mozart had done such a thing, and we haven\u2019t yet found a recording. but it The work was commissioned by the Lobkowicz family because baroque music was quickly going out of favor and they wanted Handel\u2019s work punched up a bit for audiences of Mozart\u2019s time. The second treasure is the first edition of Beethoven's 4th & 5th symphonies, with Beethoven's original annotations. There are undoubtedly other treasures among the collection of manuscripts, but these were the most astounding to us. No, you can\u2019t touch the manuscripts.If bird art or dog art is your thing, go downstairs. There\u2019s something for pretty much any museum-lover in this place.Lobkowicz Palace offers a daily concert of Czech classical music. Admission to the concert includes admission to the museum, with the best audio guide I have ever encountered. Good-quality headphones are provided, rather than ear buds or just a stick you have to hold to your ear. Also included is a discount coupon for the palace cafe. Even if you don't visit the museum, the cafe is a good choice for lunch. I tried the lunch special of goulash followed by cheesecake. My husband ordered a rather unusual ham and brie sandwich, served with potato chips and coleslaw. Everything was good, and the cafe was quiet and smoke-free."

The Lobkowicz Palace is not to be missed, not only for the attractiveness of its displays, but also for the romance and charm of the story of its recovery and resurrection by the Lobkowicz family. The idea that a Boston real estate agent can return to his family's homeland and revocer the family's past and heritage and then create a museum-- for museum the palace undoubtedly is-- is almost pure Hollywood. Throw in his grandmother overhearing two Nazi officers on the train discussing the planned German takeover of the remaining independent, rump part of Czechoslovakia left free after Munich and getting the family out of the country as the Germans march in and their return after the war only to flee again when the Communists took over the country in 1948, and it is truly a fairy tale. The coup de grace is when you meet Mr. Lobkowicz (they do not allow titles in the modern Czech Republic). He is a very approachable and down to earth person. We also enjoyed a stimulating conversation with the Asst. Curator who turns out to have been born in Kansas.However, the true value of the experience lies in the exhibits. I will not try to recount all that is there-- there is too mnuch for that. Suffice it to say that, even if nothing else was there, the Brueghel painting (\"Summer\" in the seasons series), the musical manuscript with the emendations in Mozart's own hand, the original handwritten Beethoven symphonic manuscript and the most amazing early gunpowder arms collection would be a \"cannot miss it\" by themselves. All in all, this place is a gem and well worth the stop.

The art, music manuscripts, porcelain, weapons, and other objects are interesting in themselves, but as part of the Lobkowicz family's story, they are fascinating. I usually NEVER use audio guides, but here it is an essential part of the experience to hear William Lobkowicz and others speak of the meaning of the objects for the family's and Czech history. As an example, as you stand before a portrait of a female ancestor from the early 1600's, William describes how his mother still wears a ring shown in the painting. There's a concert of Czech classical music daily at 1pm, and a terrace cafe has excellent food and fabulous views. We just loved everything about this place."

Right next to the lower gate, where most people exit the castle complex, is the best museum in Prague. Lobkowicz Palace is the family home of an old noble family who lost it all in World War II and again under the Communists. With the Velvet Revolution in the 90s, the family (who were now living in America) sought restitution. The audio tour narrated by the family members is a wonderfully told story. But it is the selected items from their restored collections that shine. For music lovers, it is a thrill to see the original manuscripts of Beethoven and Mozart (especially his orchestration of Handel's Messiah). Art lovers will thrill to Breughtel's Haymaker - yes, the one that is in all the art history books. It's wonderfully restored and beautifully displayed. There is just enough of each type of treasure to satisy the enthusiast but not too much to bore the average tourist. If you're in Prague, do not miss the Lobkowicz Palace."

Along with the church, its the most worthwhile thing to see in the Prague Castle, if not all of Prague. Hearing the voice of William Lobkowicz, the real live decedent from the USA, on the audio guide made it very personal and touching. He describes the paintings and history of his family and their collections including original scores written by Beethoven's own hand, (the Lobkowicz family was his patron). Hearing their personal story of the Nazi then Communist takeovers and their eventual return in 1989, makes this a beautiful educational experience and story: A testament to the artistic sensitivities, the strength and fortitude of the the Lobkowicz family and the Czech people. The palace itself is an Architectural gem (and the cafe is a great place to have a beer). Even our 13 year old son and 15 year old daughter were moved by it. The Palace makes history come alive."

Some members of the family also collected extraordinary paintings, that are simply breathtaking. This is all beautifully explained in a wonderful audio tour that is narrated by the American heir of the family. Their country home about 45 minutes outside of Prague by train, is equally worthwhile. Together, the 2 places, the city home and country palace provide a unique and wonderful introduction to Czech history and culture that should not be missed.

Contemporary members of the Lobkowicz family provide the highly personal and informative recorded narrative that informs the palace tour (allow at least one hour for the tour.) Their grandfather abandoned hundreds of years of princely possessions when he fled the Nazis and later the communists, settling in the United States. For the past twenty years, his children and grandchildren have worked with the Czech government to reclaim their patrimony and to share it elegantly with visitors. Their story is moving and their holdings are remarkable. Our experience was heightened by a one hour musical performance in an elegant salon (separate ticket required), a great, very American cheeseburger in the terrace restaurant with a postcard view of Prague below and the well-curated museum shop."

Ticket also gives 10% off refreshments in the adjacent restaurant which has a terrace with wonderful views over Prague) We had a very good reasonably priced lunch there.After lunch we were lucky enough to meet David Krol, the Executive Director of the museum who showed us a few extra areas not normally open to the publc and explained how the family are working really hard to restore all the treasures (buildings, art, books & manuscripts) being returned to them by the state but in great need of restoration, care & attention. We even met Alexdra Lobkowich (wife of current \"Prince\") in the corridor who welcomed us warmly on her way to a meeting.

However the visit was soured just a little when i found an exhortation to 'enter a review on Trip Adviser' printed on my entrance receipt. The Palace is managed by highly paid professionals and they are shamelessly doing all they can to exploit the free publicity and have the attraction listed as number one. To be fair, some of the collections is astounding and I found the presentation endearing (barring a middle aged man thanking his 'Mummy' for her contribution to the audio tour). More seriously, i was left deeply disturbed by the lack of any critical analysis of actions of some of the ancestors. Yes it is a lovely legend to think of Polyxena Lobkowicz sheltering the Emperor's ministers under her skirts in 1618 to save them from the Protestant mob, but there is no mention in the commentary that this event then launched the 30 year war which laid waste to 40% of the population of Europe. We are simply asked to admire Polyxena's son's military hardware and achievements on White Mountain, when he helped crush the fight for religious freedom in Bohemia. Nor is there any humble reference to the 27 noble leaders of the insurrection that were later tried and executed in Prague's Old Town Square, which the Palace curators must be aware is part of the tourist trail too. Is the exhortation on the entrance receipt a small symbol of the of the unrepentant arrogance of an aristocratic family which has not yet fully reflected on the burden of their ancestor's collusion with religion, power and money? Whatever the truth is, i think they may be part of the reason why 80% of the Czech people are now atheist. Go and visit this glorious Palace by all means, but it may leave a slightly sour taste in your mouth."

Thank goodness I ducked into the oasis of the Lobkowicz palace and even had the unnatural luck of being alone in most of the rooms on a snowy March morning. The drama that unfolded was unbelievable. The cashier suggested that I take the English version of the audioguide because Mr. Lobkowicz himself narrated the story. AND WHAT A STORY. It begins with the haunting eyes of Max who suffered unbelievable tragedy at the hands of fate and history. But it goes back over 500 years into almost mythical proportions. Did you know that a prince Lobkowicz enabled Beethoven to write his music because of his a far-sighted gift of a salary, freeing the composer up to write as he pleased? And so the story develops. The voices of the family, unpretentious Americans who have inherited this staggering weight of history and property, move the visitor to tears. No museum in Prague, which today sadly resembles a film set haunted by the sinister security forces of communist dictators, brings the city's glorious history of art and culture more emotionally to life. Do yourself a favour and accept the gitt of the Lobkowicz family for the entrance fee - presumably much-needed to keep the heritage alive."

The Lobkowicz Palace in Prague is a unique museum which invites visitors to experience the intersection of history, culture, and family. Located within the walls of Prague Castle, its warmth and sophistication provide a welcome contrast to the cold, stark medieval grandeur of the castle, and it certainly has a far more professional, polite, and well-trained staff. Additionally, the charming cafe provided a delicious lunch (and welcome heat during the winter visit!). Part of what makes this museum so special is that the continuity of the centuries is portrayed through the interests and relationships of a noble family that had enormous influence on music, art, and political events of the day. Because the audiotour is narrated by members of the Lobkowicz family, a visitor feels that Prince William Lobkowicz is personally \"hosting\" a tour through his home - certainly a far more intimate experience than that which we usually experience in a museum. As we meandered through the beautifully restored rooms, we could hear strains of the classical music being performed in one of the daily afternoon concerts at the museum. It was a lovely reminder that one of the Lobkowicz princes was a patron of Beethoven - with original manuscripts on site.While the museum has a fantastic collection including art, manuscripts, musical instruments, an armory, etc., it is positioned to be a family history and, as such, highlights the high quality collection from that perspective. It is fascinating to understand how nobility lived through the centuries, but the fact that this family lost their lands, castles, art, etc. first to the Nazis and then again the Communists is especially astounding in that they were able to recover their property each time.We had lovely conversations with Prince William Lobkowicz, his wife Alexandra, and David Krol, the Executive Director of the museum. Each was gracious and informative and personalized an already unique visit. The palace was also an interesting juxtaposition with other historic sections of the city.Do plan to spend a few hours at this museum gem - tour the palace collection, have lunch in the cafe, attend the concert, and then visit the lovely little gift shop. Wear comfortable shoes - especially if you plan to visit the castle also. We visited in freezing February, so we were delighted to thaw out in the heated palace after an uncomfortably cold tour of the castle. All in all, the Lobkowicz Palace Museum was the highlight of our trip to Prague. We would highly recommend it as a \"must see.\""

The Castle site is very large and we bought the long tour (as opposed to the short tour) and audio guide. We duly toured almost the whole complex and it was really interesting, and the area is so large that the fee you pay covers two days so when the Casle closed and we hadn't finished we decided to finish the tour on the next day. We returned on day two and finished off the long tour and as we were leaving we passed a poster of the picture by Velasquez of the little four year old Infanta . Intrigued by this we popped into the building by the entrance to the Castle called the Lobkowicz Palace. The really helpful man at the ticket desk explained that this was a Palace belonging to the Lobkowicz family which had been seized by the Nazis during the war and the collection had been broken up. After the War the possessions had been returned but they were then seized again by the communists after the Prague Spring. On the election of Vaclav Havel the familly once more regained the possessions that had been lost and had opened the Palace as a museum to the public.We bought tickets which included audio guide and set off. The tour was narrated by William Lobkowicz and her explained the family history going back to the 1500s, and the family portraits in the galleries were brought vividly to life by his narrative. We met the strong women and men of the great houses of Europe and heard the parts that they had played in the history of their countries. Dynastic marriages came to life as we toured the palace and various members of the Lobkowicz family also appeared on the guide and gave their view of different aspects of the story, such as Martin Lobkowicz, William's Father, recalling riding his bike along the corridors of Roudnice Castle, another family residence in the area, when he was a child under what he felt was the disapproving gaze of his ancestors.We saw the original of the Velasquez portrait, two magnificent Canalettos and a Breughelas well as a host of less well known paintings. The object d'art and the porcelain, musical instruments and scores by famous composers was a treasure house of pleasure, and the staff of the museum were amongst the most courteous and hospitable of all the people that we met in Prague.I would urge anyone visiting this beautiful city to make the Lobkowicz their prime venue for understanding the importance of Prague in European history.If I could only choose one place to go in Prague it would most definately be The Lobkowicz Palace."

What makes it so captivating is the audio tour, which I usually don't bother with, but this one comes with the cost of admission. Mr. Lobkowicz, who narrates the tour personally in English, is engaging with his personal stories and telling of the history of the objects and home. It was fun -- and the personal items from Mozart and Beethoven in the music room were really amazing. The attached cafe was good too. This is definitely worth your time in Prague, and it's on the same grounds as Prague Castle, so it's conveniently located."

I was drawn to the museum because a poster indicated that they had a Velazquez portrait of the Infanta Margarita. When I got into the museum, I realized that the breadth of the collection surpassed my highest hopes. To make the experience even better, there is an amazing audioguide (and believe me, my fiancee and I typically despise audioguides) and fantastic descriptions of every piece of art. Instead of wandering around looking at portraits, hoping to recognize a familiar historical figure, visitors have written descriptions at their fingertips and can clearly connect the family portraits with the Lobkowicz family history. Okay, I know, why would you want to see the family history of a name that sounds as obscure as Lobkowicz? Because these people connected with almost every notable character in history, and they kept mementos of each relationship - in the case of Mozart, Beethoven, and Haydn, those include original scores! You have to go. It kills the Palace. I really can't say enough. I didn't want the museum to end, and I have never gotten so close to such unbelievable art."

Prague has incredible tourist sites, but this was a hidden gem! The Prague Castle complex, the main tourist attraction, is no longer a palace - it is the seat of government. However, next door is Lobkowicz Palace, a privately-owned palace with all the royal goodies you would expect - beautiful royal portraits, collections of instruments and fabulous dishware. And what a story behind the Lobkowicz family - the prince leaving Czechoslovakia after WWI with only the coat on his back, to the return of his grandson in the 1990's (a Harvard-educated American real estate professional), after the latest Czech Republic was established and offered an opportunity for royals to reclaim their property. The beautiful museum offers a complimentary audio-tour, and the English version was recorded by the Prince himself. We definitely recommend the audio-tour - it included the family's personal story and reflections (\"this was the house where my grandfather spent his summers\"), not just an art history commentary on the items. The museum also has a charming cafe with an incredible private view of the city. We had the good fortune to bump into the museum's director, Mr. Krol, and his comments added a special dimension to our visit."

However, to overlook the Lobkowicz Palace in that very same complex would be an incredible oversight. This palace and it's private collection are open to the public for a very modest sum and once inside, the visitor gets treated to a peek inside one of the most influential Czech families of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. A friend and I just happend to be walking by when we decided to enter and take the audio tour. The palace is set on two floors and the rooms of portriats are organized according to the family chronology. As we had no prior knowledge of Czech royal history beforehand, we both found this exhibit thoroughly enjoyable and incredibly educational. The audio tour was narrated by the Prince Lobkowicz himself, with whom we had the surprise pleasure of actually meeting while we were exiting the exhibit. The paintings were indeed a look into another time and the feeling of the entire palace was more of a private residence than a display of artifacts, with the proximity we were allowed to get to the works. Our favorite parts were the arms collection (said to be one of the greatest in all of Europe) and the music room, where on display was Mozart's hand-annotated score of Handel's Messiah and a wealth of Beethoven's works. All-in-all, this was THE hightlight of our sightseeing trip in Prague."

We were bewitched by the story-telling and followed the Lobkowicz history throughout the centuries, as we passed through their many wonderful salons. Our breaths were taken away especially by their Music and Shooting Galleries. We have never seen so many rare and exquisite gun collections anywhere. For Classical Music lovers, we have to be so thankful to the 7th Prince Lobkowicz, that through his patronage, we could appreciate some of the best music of Beethoven today. We were however, disappointed, because we missed the daily concert played inside the Music Room. The restaurant was also a great place to stop by at the end of the tour, and has a refined ambience. The palace was a blessing, and we recommend travellers of all ages and backgrounds to visit it before they leave Prague.

The in depth family history from the first room through the different tidbits of special interests like music, dogs, and special family collection like the armour and china and religious relics all created a great picture of where the family started, how it has progressed through time and finally where they are headed over the course of the coming generations.

Decorative arts begin with a Romanesque Cross c 1125 and proceed through gorgeous Delft porcelain services. Armor, rifles and pistols with magnificent decorations abound. This is after the Piranesi room. The music collection has you survey beautiful lutes, violins and trumpets. There is a special thrill as you learn that the 7th Prince Lobkowicz was one of Beethoven's most generous benefactors. Stand inches from Beethoven's orginal score for the 5th Symphony and note that it was dedicated to the Prince. The 6th Symphony, similarly dedicated, sits beside it. Stand next to Mozar'ts orignal score of his revisions of Handel's Messiah and clearly see the contributions his additions made. The depth and breadth of this collection leaves you awestruck.

Most important was the audioguide (included in the entrance fee) narrated by Prince William Lobkowicz in English that transforms what would be a museum tour into a living experience of his family and the history of Bohemia for the past four centuries. I strongly recommend a visit to the Palace while in Prague. You may even meet Prince William, as I did, having tea at the cozy coffee shop downstairs and let him give you a personal account of his endeavors to offer visitors a view on his family's heritage."

The Lobkowicz has one of the best narrated audioguides taking you through the collections and rooms of the Palace - including a highlight of red-numbered audio points for those with limited tour time. But it's actually worth listeining through the entire audio guide, which is narrated mainly by the Lobkowicz scion William, but also by his mother, father and the Palace' s main curator. The history of the family in Hapsburg times as well as through the Nazi occupation and Communist takeover is well-covered and very interesting to listen to. As important arts & music patrons, the family's collection of original Beethoven scores is impressive, as is the Breughel 'Seasons' panel, \"The Haymaking\" in their art collection.Afterwards, have a drink or meal at the Cafe in the courtyard (or if you can reserve a table - the balcony overlooking Prague town). There should be a 10% discount on your bill with a ticket to the Palace."

If you are short on time skip the castle ticket (but do walk around the castle grounds). The tour is brilliantly laid out and the audio tour gives great information. Typically I get bored quickly with audio tours but this was truly great...they had a great understanding of how much time to spend on the main items they wanted you to walk away with. Just wish we had enough time to visit the Lobkowicz summer palace just outside of Prague."

It is 15 miles out of town and easily accesible by train.

The art, religious artifacts, weaponry, and other items were wonderful to view. However, the highlight was the story behind the family told during the audio tour, which is included in the entry fee. Also, we enjoyed a good meal in their restaurant which allows seating on a balcony overlooking Prague. I recommend getting their hamburger, which was delicious and one of the beers that they brew. The Lobkowicz Palace also offers daily afternoon concerts, which we were not able to see due to its cancellation for President Obama\u2019s visit. To get to Lobkowicz Palace, get off at metro station Malostranska. Outside at the street, turn left and walk a short distance until you see on your left a series of steps and ramps leading up to the Prague Castle grounds. The Lobkowicz Palace is built into the Prague Castle wall. A great part of our Prague visit and something that should not be missed."

While the museum is interesting and has a nice collection that belongs to the Lobkowicz family, I must disagree with this being the #1 \"Thing to do\" in Prague.It gives fresh air when the Palace is so heavily crowded, the collection of art, items and paintings is indeed interesting but it does not beat, at all, a walk in the Old Town Square, seeing, watching and understanding the great astronomical clock, crossing the Charles Bridge late at night when crowds dissapear, looking at the incredible illumination that beautiful buildings have at dusk, getting lost in the small streets of Prague, and other attractions that are well mentioned here.Better than St. Vitus?

It was absolutely phenomenally done. The audio tour is done by today's Lobkowicz's which added a real personal touch to the tour (and its free!!!). The layout of the whole museum was really well done and the whole story is just breath-taking, all the pieces that they've managed to recollect after losing it twice! An absolute must see!! Even those who don't like museums must see this. I must admit that I was wondering how fun could a museum about a family really be, but I was blown away and after an hour of touring I wanted more. Surprisingly this place is barren, we were the only people in there the whole time, so you also avoid all the bustling tourists.Oh and a side note, they do on rare occasions close the first floor of the museum for dinners and functions so make sure not to leave this for the last day of your trip as the floor may be closed."

Weaponry, porcelains, historical documents, furnishings and much more.

After 10 days of visiting the many wonderful museums in Prague, my husband and I decided to \"take a chance\" on the Lobkowicz Palace even though it was given just a slight mention in only one of our tour books. We're so glad we saw it. The quality and breadth of this family's collections are truly amazing. Everything about this museum is first class -- from the exhibits themselves to the extremely well-produced audio guide. The narrator of the audio guide -- a member of the Lobkowicz Family -- \"personalized\" the experience for us. He provided the right amount of detail to put the art and artifacts in context, and he did it in an interesting way. Seeing this family's portraits alone would have been worth the price of admission, but there was so much more: historic ceramics in pristine condition, armaments, religious artifacts, original manuscripts by classical composers...the list goes on. I also enjoyed the rich dark hot chocolate in the palace cafe after our tour!"

            "review": "As fantastic as everyone says!. We are in Prague for 3 days. We spent the first two around Old Town, Jewish Quarter, etc.Today, we went over to the Castle side by taking the metro, and then tram 22 to Pohorelec stop and walked downhill the whole way.We saw the changing of the guard that was interesting, and then looked at the tours available. The main palace and golden lane, etc. are pretty expensive, 200 - 350 or so depending on the tour, and the cathedral is free. My husband wanted to go to the cathedral, but the line was pretty long and it looked like a 2 hour wait, so we satisfied ourselves with photos of the outside, and continued on to the low side of the complex where the Lobkowicz Palace is located.I was telling my husband the whole time that it sounded from the reviews I'd read that this was the one thing worth seeing... he was suitably unconvinced and sort of rolling his eyes.The cost was about 275 each, which didn't help his attitiude. However, from the moment we put the included audio guide on and the current heir to the Lobkowicz estate, William Lobkowicz, who grew up in the US, began to tell the family's story, it was magical!The family was exiled from their home in the Czech republic twice: Once by the Nazis and once by the communists, and finally have had their rightful things restored to them, and opened their palaces as museums to display their collections.I'm not one to spend long hours in museums, I tend to get bored and so just glaze over things and look for the most relevant ones. The audio guide at this palace draws your attention to the numbers in red as the main relevant things to look at and punch into the guide if you are short on time (or have a short attention span like I do), but in this case, I found myself slowly punching in more and more of the non-red numbers as everything was quite interesting.The tour started on the second floor with paintings of various ancestors and the family tree, loaded with marriages between the Lobkowicz line and several royal lines, including Austrian, Spanish, etc.As we progressed through the rooms we came to the various treasure rooms, with interesting antiques collected by the various family princes through the past several centuries.... these rooms also had supplemental laminated sheets to explain the individual items in more detail than the audio guide, so be sure to look for these if you are interested and pick one up while in the room to learn more about the items.We then came to a music room. Several of the princes were big supporters of music of the times, and the seventh and eighth princes were benefactors and friends of Beethoven. In this room, there is a huge, long manuscript of one opera with notes in the margins by Beethoven himself and even a note from Beethoven to one of the Lobkowicz princes letting him know that he had received his latest stipend from the family. Apparently the Lobkowicz family was responsible for at least part of Beethoven's ability to spend time writing great works of music by keeping him \"on the books\" and free to create.In addition, there is a manuscript of Handel's Messiah, which had been edited by Mozart himself... with Handel's music vehemently scribbled over, and new notes written on the other side of the page by Mozart himself.There were also various old instruments in this room which were interesting, but nothing could equal the awe with which one viewed the musical manuscripts.One of the last rooms on the second floor contained a famous work by the Dutch artist Brueghel. I'm not as into paintings as some, but it was lovely, and many would say the highlight of the collection, although for me, the music room was definitely the best.The tour then goes to the first floor, where William's father tells you tales of remembrance from his childhood until he was 10 and the family was kicked out of the country.There are displays on this floor by the women (William's wife and mother) who are into the conservation side of things. There is a \"bird room\" with recently restored bird paintings, which have real feathers on them, which all had to be recently restored from pest and water damage, and a room devoted to the various family dogs through the centuries.The second floor was more spectacular than the first, but the first floor gave you more of a feel of the contemporary family as it lived in the palace. There were also painted frescoes on the ceilings of the last few rooms, which were quite nice.After the tour, which took us around 1.5 hours, we were starving, and went to the cafe on-site, where we sat out on a balcony of the palace, overlooking Prague, and drank Lobkowicz beer (yes, the family brewery which was recently returned to them) and ate quite yummy czech goulash and schnitzel. We were impressed with the quality of the food at this tourist site, and the setting was fantastic too. You also receive a 10% off voucher for the cafe when you purchase tickets to the Palace, and the meal was not expensive to begin with for a proper sit-down meal in such a nice setting.All-in-all, as others have said here on Tripadvisor, the Lobkowicz Palace is #1 for a reason... it is truly a find. I suppose what made it even better is that not a lot of people seem to know about it, and it was not crowded with tourists as so many other sties are.I would recommend if you only have time or inclination to visit one place in-depth on the castle grounds, this is the one. Truly a find!"

Trip Advisor rates the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague Castle as the number on attraction so I had to go check it out. Like most other people I would have totatly missed this exhibition had it not been for trip advisor. The collection is absoulutly stunning. Every piece looks as good as it did the day it was created. A few of my favorite rooms included the Music room with actually pieces from both Mozart and Beethoven on display, the Armory rooms, and the Piranesi room which as hand drawings of pictures of room that are unreal!!! The audio guide is awesome and is actually nice to listen to. If you can, get there at a time which they are having a live concert in the music room, masterful piano players preforming famous pieces of music. My trip has taking me to Rome, Munich, Ulm, Berlin, and Prague and I have been to some of the most famous musuems out there and would but this one right up there in the top 3. If you are not a museum lover then this is not for you. It takes about and hour+ but you can go at your own speed and probably finish faster. If you like art, you like history, and you like want to see some remarkably well preserved pieces then this is the place for you. Price is a little steep, I paid student price of 175ck which is about 12usd, non students are 250czk but its well worth it. Only bummer was, you aren't allowed to take pictures inside the musuem. oh, and Also there is a nice restraunt down stairs which you will get a 10% off coupon too which is actually really good and has a nice view!"

This brand new museum, which opened in 2008, is not in any of the tour books (Rick Steves, Fodors, etc) so it's relatively unknown. However, don't let the fact that it's relatively empty turn you off: inside is a charming look into the life of the Lobkowicz family and some Czech history.Be warned that entrance is not too cheap, but it includes an audio guide which will guide you through the entire museum. The audio (at least, the English) is narrated by the current Lobkowicz prince, with occasional cameos from other family members and friends. This family, which at one point owned something like 18 castles and a ton of land and wealth, lost all of it to the Nazis in WWII. After the war ended, they got it back, but only to have the communists take it away again shortly thereafter. The family was forced to flee - reduced from 18 castles to literally nothing - and moved to Massachusetts. After communism fell, they returned, were able to get much of their grounds back, but apparently, none of the wealth. With the costs of taxes, maintenance, repairs, etc, and out of good will, they are now opening up their family property to the public.The exhibits include portraits of family members (wonderfully described in the audio guide), a beautiful china collection, various gorgeous artifacts, an arms & armor collection, works of art, and more. The audioguide is brilliant at walking you through the museum and explaining the importance and background of the various items. You really get an appreciation for a painting you otherwise might have walked by without a second glance. One of my favorite exhibits had original manuscripts from Mozart and Beethoven - both of whom were funded by the Lobkowicz family - including corrections, edits and the like. Moreover, the audioguide features a good deal of their music, really adding to the experience.This may not be the richest or largest museum you'll visit, and perhaps the Lobkowicz family pats themselves on the back just a bit too much in the audioguide, but it's a unique, lovely and memorable experience. Go there now, before everyone else finds out!"

It's all amazing, beautiful, incredible, but the music room is one of the most fascinating museum exhibits I've ever seen. I had chills more than once in the room looking at the incredible pieces of musical history.

The collections are extraordinary, for their artistic merit and for their historic sweep - but they are not overwhelming in size. Instead, one feels one is beingtaken on a personal tour by the members of the Lobkowicz family who present highlights of the collections on an informative audiotape. As for the collections themselves, I have not seen their equal in Prague, and rarely elsewhere. A few examples: In painting, the elder Brueghel's Haymaking; a lovely Madonna by Lucas Cranach the Elder; two outstanding Canaletto views of London. In music, Beethoven scores, and Mozart's own mark-up of Haydn's Messiah. Fine decorative arts; wonderful rifles and armor. But this is not an impersonal museum. The exhibition pulses with the blood of a family, over many centuries. That family's changing tastes and experiences unify the collections and bring to life the history of Central Europe from the Thirty Years' War to the Nazis, the Communist expropriations, the Velvet Revolution and the present day. I cannot overstate how much I relished my visit to the collections in the Lobkowicz Palace."

Inside Prague Castle, this historic family has opened up their treasures to the world including priceless Breughel, Canalettos, Beethoven orignal compositions in a fantastic musuem with hi-tech audio tour. Not one of those boring museums but laced with real history and great exhibits. Topping it off is the impeccable cafe with endless city views and great healthy foods with best ice cream in Prague. Even the gift shop has authentic period jewlery at fair prices and interesting adults/kids stuff that is anything but touristy. You feel like a prince in this home of Prince Lobkowicz. All of this in the best section of Prague and part of Prague Castle."

            "review": "One of Prague's Best-Kept Secrets. Prague has a lot of attractions, but my favorite was one that is not in most of the guidebooks because it's too new. I realize that it seems strange to say that a 400-year old palace is too new, but it's only been open to the public with its current exhibits in the past year. I first learned about Lobkowicz Palace from an article in the Wall Street Journal in March of 2008, so I immediately put it on my itinerary for our April trip to Prague. I'm glad I did, because it was the highlight of our trip to Prague.The Lobkowicz princes were members of an aristocratic Czech family that came to prominence in the early 1600's, helping the Hapsburgs to rule the Austro-Hungarian Empire. They had at least six castles and palaces in Eastern Europe---mostly in Bohemia. They were very important to art and music, amassing an impressive art collection and also supporting Beethoven and other classical composers. In fact, Beethoven' s Symphony No. 3 (the Eroica) was dedicated to one of the Lobkowicz princes. The Lobkowicz Palace is conveniently located right on the grounds of the Prague Castle, but a little difficult to find. When you go through the main entrance to the castle grounds, go past all the buildings, past St. Vitus Cathedral and all the others, and almost at the end of the grounds, look to the right and you'll see Lobkowicz Palace. Inside, you'll find one of the most impressive art collections in Prague including a couple of Canalettos and an historic painting depicting the Defenestration of Prague. Of course, there are also a lot of great portraits of the Lobkowicz ancestors. Be sure to use the acoustic guide, because the narration is fascinating and goes into the history of the Lobkowicz family, Bohemia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. What was really interesting to us was the identity of the narrator---none other than William Lobkowicz, descendant of the Lobkowicz princes and current owner of the palace. The Lobkowicz holdings were expropriated first by the Nazis and then by the communists. William Lobkowicz fought a legal battle over many years to reclaim the family's holdings after the fall of communism. He has now restored the palace and put the family's impressive art collection on display to preserve an amazing cultural tradition. William himself is the all-American type, having been born in Massachusetts, graduated from Harvard where he rowed crew and played squash, and then worked as a commercial real estate broker in Boston. He went to Prague after 1989 to reclaim his family's property and decided to stay on and make preserving Czech culture his life's work. Locals told me that he speaks Czech fluently. We had lunch at the museum cafe the day we saw the art collection, but my wife and I liked it so much that we returned for lunch the following day when we were visiting other parts of the Prague castle. We also noticed that there are daily concerts in the palace.A visit to Lobkowicz Palace is highly recommended. Go right away before the word gets out and it gets in all the guidebooks and the crowds will descend on the palace. I was so impressed with Lobkowicz Palace, that I was inspired to take the train the following day to Nelahozeves Castle, another of the Lobkowicz holdings, that is only a half hour outside Prague. That's where I learned even more about this aristocratic Bohemian family."

A museum with history in exhibitions, especially the original oil paintings, family treasures including their remarkable music room with original scores on view from Beethoven and Mozart. Their down to earth \"customer friendly\" staff warrants mention from restrauant (great food) to the museum shop. David Krol, Deputy Director was informative and best of all was his invitation to sit down for a pleasant chat with Sarah and William Lobowicz about their family history as well as getting back into their possession, all that was taken from them over the years. Lunch was perfect as was the midday classical concert (simply don't miss this event). We enjoyed this outing so much, we took a train on Saturday to see their Renaissance Castle in Nelahozeves. Another terrific morning that we suggest to all those willing to spend a morning including a short train ride to the country. If Prague gives you a glow, which it will, then this palace with make your heart pound and even tempt you to assist in the support of more of this cultural lifestyle.Nancy & Bob, Alpharetta, GA"

The Lobkowicz collections are vast, covering almost every field of the arts - hugely impressive and the audio tours linking the exhibits with the family history make it more \"human\". There is great emphasis on music and there is a classical concert every lunchtime. Wonderful. Don't miss it if you find yourself in Prague!"

The music room is breathtaking and to actually see the original scores of Beethoven\u2019s fourth and fifth symphonies does take your breath away. I was fortunate enough to find myself almost alone in this museum, so I took my time examining the details of Canaletto\u2019s paintings and, of course, the jewel of the crown, Brueghel the Elder\u2019s Haymaking."

I was recently in Prague on a business trip, and with only a couple of hours free, I went to the top of the hill to the Prague Castle complex. I had picked up a flier about some chamber orchestra music at the Lobkowicz Palace, and wandered by. I decided to take in the roughly 1-hour set of (excellent) classical music, and then took an audio guide through the collection. The story of the family is amazing! The 7th Prince Lobkowicz was one of Beethoven's biggest patrons, and 3 of Beethoven's symphonies are dedicated to the Prince (with signed scores in the museum). The family's quest to claim the treasures--taken by the Nazis and then the Communists--is remarkable in itself. The Palace has been beautifully restored, and makes you feel like you've gone back in time. It doesn't take long to go through the collection, and I highly recommend the audio guide. Very much worth the trip."

            "review": "You would be surprised, amazed, and glad not to have missed it. Lobkowicz Palace is a very enjoyable family-run museum. Its entrance is right opposite the place where you emerge from the Golden Street in Prague Castle. Being run by the Lobkowicz family, the Palace requires an admission fee separate from the rest of the castle, but you will not regret paying it. This really is a must see place.It is not a traditional museum with a collection of Roman sculptures, Impressionists, a Picasso or two, etc. This museum is devoted to the Lobkowicz family history, which involves figures as prominent as Mozart and Beethoven; the latter dedicated his Eroica Symphony to a Lobkowicz. The collection features (different) musical scores of both with corrections in their own hands made specifically for the concerts given for the Lobkowiczes. If you thought that \"old money\" refers to Rockefellers, visit the Lobkowicz Palace, and you will see the difference.The complimentary audioguide is mostly narrated (in English) by the current owner, the Lobkowicz who only recently regained his family treasures and now proudly tells you about them; this makes listening a really personal experience that is also well orchestrated, literally. But he steps down to give the podium to the museum's arts curator in what concerns the most prominent paintings of the collection, which includes such masters as Cranach, Velasquez, and Pieter Brueghel the Elder. Brueghel fans simply must visit the museum to see one of the 5 surviving paintings from his \"6 Seasons\" series (another one is in Metropolitan Museum in New York with the remaining three in Vienna Kunsthistorisches Museum).An interesting touch to the collection is that almost every historical personage mentioned in the audioguide can be typically seen in portrait somewhere nearby, which creates a kind of a visual accompaniment to the narration.Unlike in most museums, the collection is not overwhelming, though still awe-inspiring. All highlights of the collection are on the 2nd floor. By the way, the museum closes about an hour later than the rest of the castle's attractions. There are curious items, armor, musical instruments, china; in short, there is something for everyone."

I stepped into the Lobkowicz Palace just for one of their daily concerts (very nice!) and ended up going to the museum and cafe afterwards (you get a 10% discount in the cafe if you visit the musuem). The exhibit was a touching and elegant display of the Lobkowicz family history and treasures (which include rare arms, Canalettoes, Cranachs, a Velasquez, a Brueghel, and music manuscripts by Beethoven and Mozart). A free audio guide is narrated by members of the family. The cafe seriously has the best food in Prague Castle--be sure to sit on the balcony for an amazing view of the city!"

            "review": "Lobkowicz Palace--where nonsense and frivolity come alive (without refunds). The following is a review of the Lobkowicz Palace's Princely Collection and accompanying audioguide (not a review of the cafe, which had fairly good food at fairly high prices, not to mention that we ate there before we went to the exhibit, where we received a 10% off coupon to the cafe for having purchased a ticket to the museum--a coupon I had to give away to some other tourists).Merriam-Webster defines a \"museum\" as \"an institution devoted to the procurement, care, study, and display of objects of lasting interest or value.\" Unfortunately, the Lobkowicz family, in deeming their institution a \"museum,\" failed to comprehend this fundamental purpose. I expected a series of rooms, home to portraiture, fine musical instruments, and an extensive display of old Czech arms, all donated by the noble Lobkowicz family's collection compiled over the course of several centuries. Instead, I was subjected to the incoherent ramblings of Mr. Lobkowicz, who narrated the English version of the free audioguide available with the far-from-free entrance ticket. He pointed out interesting pieces in the museum, how his family acquired them, and how his family fared in the area around Prague. I had to walk around a museum, looking at portraits of his ancestors, and listen to his life story. Information about the original manuscripts by composers like Beethoven was overlooked to provide \"more important\" highlights about which Lobkowicz received the works' dedications and which Lobkowicz was intelligent, insightful, and wonderful enough to sacrifice time and money to support the struggling composers. Many of the pieces not directly related to the family, including antique stringed instruments, were not covered in the audioguide nor even labeled, which is a basic requirement in museums (I had rather incorrectly assumed). The Lobkowicz family simply arranged a series of paintings and artifacts in their \"palace,\" without feeling the need to explain who the artists were and from what era they originate. The more important pieces in the museum (the pieces not directly telling of the Lobkowicz genealogy), like the famed Bruegel work \"Haymaking,\" were barely outlined in the audioguide (and not narrated by Mr. Lobkowicz, who probably didn't find the paintings interesting because his great-great-great-great-inbred-third cousin was not featured). The irrelevance of the museum reached an all-time high (or low, depending on how you look at it) in the \"Bird Room\" and the \"Dog Room,\" dedicated to portraiture of dead family pets, with an audio presentation dedicated to nonsense about how museum visitors should donate money to the Lobkowicz family so they can further hire artists to paint pics of their pups to, get this, \"preserve the Czech heritage.\"This \"museum\"--the worst in Europe--was only opened in April of 2007. If we get the word out about the awful experiences to be had in the museum, hopefully it might be closed and unsuspecting tourists might keep a few more Czech crowns in their pockets. The Prague Castle is a great site to see (toward the end of your visit to Prague), but this particular area of the Castle should be considered strictly off-limits. Preserve your sanity and visit a REAL museum, for they will not refund the price of your ticket."

I had the chance to visit the newly openned Princely Collections exhibit at the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague Castle. This is one of the best museum experiences I have had.

I saw paintings by Brueghl and Cannaletto. Original musical manuscripts by Beethoven. I also had lunch at their cafe which served excellent soups, wraps and dessert (my favorite was their family cheesecake!) and had a great view over the city. Do not miss this one."
