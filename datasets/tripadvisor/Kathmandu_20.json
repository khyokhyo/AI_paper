Catch a glimpse if you can but don't stress if you don't."

Kumari Temple is based out of Durbar Sqaure. A small girl of age around 10-12 is regarded as goddess in Nepal, whose blessing is not only persued by common people, but also by kings and politicians of nepal. It was said that before going anywhere and before doing anything good, king used to pray before Kumari.It is an exemplary specimen of ancient Nepalese architecture, but is now destroyed by the recent earthquake.

However, when in Kathmandu and all that so I agreed to go into the enclosure to \"see\" the living goddess only to hang around 45 minutes to then be shouted at from in upstairs window that she was busy!From what I understand this child comes to an upstairs window on a few occasions a day, looks out and goes away again.Didn't miss much then?Don't know, but the architecture surrounding her home is well worth seeing even if she doesn't come out."

My first thought was how stringent our child protective laws are in the United States. But have endeavored to learn more about this ancient practice of raising a living goddess. Our guide tried to persuade her caregivers to allow her to come to the window, but she never did. He said she might if there were more people. Foreigners are not allowed inside the house. Then I noticed the donation box. Maybe money would have brought her into view. I had never heard of this Kumari and left with an interest in learning more."

If you are lucky enough (or blessed in Nepali's jargon) you will have a chance to see Kumari in one of three windows. She has only one public appearance in a year, BUT... if there are a lot tourist, she shows up for a minute or two in the morning or afternoon - depends on the season (if it's not too dark, too cold, and other factors). If you are about to visit this place during the winter - around December - it's worth to go there around 4pm and wait. If there are more tourists (more than 10-15 I would say), her chamberlain will check the situation from one of the windows and once he says that you are not allowed to use your camera, you are lucky enough, as Kumari will show up for a while then. But don't forget to turn off your camera as it's forbidden. And make a small donation then - You saw a living G-d!!! :)"

This palace, built in 1757, is known commonly as \"Kumari-Ghar\", with awesome wood carvings and traditional Nepalese architecture. The \"Kumari\" is a young girl - aged around 7 to 8 years old, believed to be an incarnation of Goddess Taleju. Visiting \"Kumari-Ghar\" is a must while in Kathmandu and the \"Living Goddess\" makes daily appearances around 4PM. She appears at a small balcony on the third floor of the inner patio. She won't smile or talk. Pictures are strictly forbidden (her pictures are sold at the palace's entrance). As soon as she appears, she leaves. Remember: she is only a small girl and probably tired of tourists. The young \"Kumari\" will lose her deity after her first period. According to Nepalese legends, former \"Kumaris\" find it rather difficult to marry afterwards, as husbands would \"die\" shortly after marriage. Probably just a legend for tourists like us. I visited Kathmandu on February 2015, nearly two and a half months before the terrible earthquake that devastated Nepal. Recent reviews by important newspapers state that, fortunately, \"Kumari Chowk\" or \"Kumari -Ghar\" remains unharmed at Durbar Square (a tow of Rs 750.00 is charged to all visitors to enter Hanuman-Dhoka Durbar Square).

The girl is then kept in isolation and is never allowed for her feet to touch the floor, she has helpers that do most things for her. As soon as the Kumari reaches puberty, she is considered impure.The Kumari is then dethroned and returned to her family whoms she last saw when she was very young. Whilst I think it is incredible that a living goddess is in existence, I felt incredilby sad at the same time, that one day this young girl will have her privileges removed and will somehow have to try and live a 'normal' life.

Whereupon a woman looked out to first be sure that we all put away our cameras before. Kumari looked out the window in her regal attire showing her beauty but un seemingly inexpressive of those of us who looked at her from below.Be sure to visit the Kumari Ghar but take into account that what goes so much as for her outer palace courtyard it certainly seems unfit for such a divine manifestation.

Say in Bali. Only that I find it amusing that the people here would find a living and breathing body of a girl as a substitute to a common stone idol. Pretty neat.We went into her royal abode without any hope of seeing her at all. Suddenly there was a commotion in the little courtyard and we had a hunch that she was about to appear.There she was at the window wearing a shiny yellow dress with a knot in her hair and traditional facial makeup. The only word for me was 'gutted' as the air was knocked out of my stomache and out it all went through my nose. It was a godly stare indeed and I felt small and somewhat pathetic in her presence.Then off she went after granting us some 5 seconds or so of her godly graces and the briefness of it all made it all the more special. Personally, I've never been in the presence of any god. So this must be what it feels like.God to me shall remain unseen but just for a fleeting moment of grandiose lowliness, you should try visiting the Kumari Chowk. She just might appear.Only one tip. You'll never know if you don't go."

The house itself is nothing special compared to Kumari stories. However, this place was built in the past especially for the worshiping of Kumari. Those who want to do puja (Hindu religious rituals) with Kumari can actually book an appointment. Until this day, the president of Nepal visits Kumari from time to time for her blessings. I would advise you to find and read a book called From Goddess to Moral, told by a former Kumari and written by a British journalist. It's very easy to find this book in bookstores around Thamel."

The Kumari is a young girl who is the reincarnation of Taleju, the living goddess. She was discovered when she was about four years old after passing many tests. She could not show fear from the severed head of a water buffalo; she had to select items that belonged to the last incarnation of the Kumari from many objects; and more. She lives in a house that serves as a monastic enclosure from the time she is four until she reaches puberty - at which time another Kumari is selected. It is great good fortune to see the Kumari, but no photos may be taken of her. We entered the Kumari Bahal past two splendid ritual lions that were brightly painted. We were ushered into a courtyard and told that we should quietly wait. She didn't always show herself. After less than ten minutes, the Kumari came to an upper window. She was beautifully made up with heavy eye makeup and was wearing a plain pink angora sweater. She stood quietly and gazed at us without reacting to our namatses. And, as quickly as she showed her face, she was gone again. I felt very fortunate to have seen her and felt that it was a great blessing for me. As I walked away, I wondered at her happiness. She looked so pensive and unresponsive. I bought three portrait postcards of her and think about her since I saw her."

If she would be sacred it means that she is not reincarnation of goddess but if she would be fine then she will spend the rest of her childhood and teenage at the tample, not allowed to have contact with others only the monks, she would be not able to walk on the ground. She will serve her duty till she will become a women then....she is off....and another one is chosen...I asked my guid what will hapan to this young women after???? she wil get a good eduaction....but nowone could tell me wich kind of and how can you be a normal person in such complicated situation when you are away from society for such a long time You can not take a picture of Kumari while you are visiting her palace but I took a pic of her bedroom appartmet window....look ...there is a doll in the window and maybe you can not see but there is a doll house there...poor kid who has to play games with herseslf among monks...well it was interesting experience for me to see such a different society...like almost fro middle agas....but still exist!!!"

Kumari is a girl selected by the community (there are only 2 or 3 of them in Kathmandu I guess..she is left at this place at an age of 3-4 and lives there until puberty. She is not exposed to an outside world. She is assumed to be a goddess.she just looks outside from a window of a temple several times a day for a few seconds and people stare at her. It is sad that she isolated from children her age, a proper education. It is sad to watch her..And our guide told us that no one wants to marry her as she is considered a goddess."

When she appeared in the window she was beautifully dressed but, amusingly, seemed very antsy like any other 8 year old girl who wants to be doing something else. When she appeared, all the Nepalis immediately put their hands in namaste position and bowed their heads. I asked the guides how they choose her and it is dependent upon her caste, her horoscope, etc. When she gets her period, however, she will be replaced by a new living goddess. I would not wait around for hours to see her, but if you are Kathmandu's Durbar Square and the timing is right, make sure to go to where she appears."

The entrance is usually flanked by two women selling postcards.Tourists are only allowed into the central courtyard and pictures are not permitted whatsoever, don't even try.We went over in the late evening and sat on the steps reading our guidebook, when suddenly, the Kumari made an appearance on the balcony, looked at us for a few seconds and walked away. The moment was fleeting but one which I would never forget."

Easily missed if u are not familiar with the place or if u dun come with a local guide. There are a few old ladies sitting by the entrance of the building, selling postcards of the Kumari. Mind your head as u enter, as these ladies will warn u - door entrance is really not very high. Our guide called out to her/ her guardians in Nepalese. We were lucky to see the Kumari for quite a few minutes as she appeared by her window and smiled at us. There's a small wooden donation box at the courtyard. Strictly no photos allowed. This was the highlight of our trip!"

Don't be dissapointed if she does not show up... From 7-8 visits I only witnessed her presence at the upper window only twice. Sometimes asking the guard nicely, and visibly putting 500 rupees in the donation box will do the trick. But do not take it for granted. Four to 10 year olds, even goddesses, will be quite fickle."

We were together with a large Chinese tour group and the guide convinced the kumari to come out. They are very strict about photographs so we couldn't get a photo. I read somewhere that seeing the royal kumari brings you luck so hope 2012 is lucky for me!"
