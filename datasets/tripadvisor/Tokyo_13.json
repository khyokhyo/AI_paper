The Asakusa Kannon Temple of ads it is known , the Sensoji Temple is the key attraction on Asakusa which takes you back to old Tokyo and the Edo era. Once through the Hozomon Gate you will find the five story Pagoda that was reconstructed in 1973. Close by is the Nakamise shopping Street that has just about anything you might need from crackers to clothing in a myriad of small shops. If you have an interest in Japanese Yukata or kimono this is a place to look. Otherewise this is probably the best place around to see what old style Tokyo was like. Grom Ginza Station take the Asakusa line and get off at Asakusa and go to Exit 4."

We went there an hour before it closed hoping there would less people. The shopping street was still full of people and you really do not want to do much shopping when it's that crowded. We just went through the side street to the temple which was perfect. Less people when we came out of so we managed to browse a few shops.The temple itself was nothing special. The ground was well maintained in beautiful Japanese style."

Nakamise-dori had great selection of souvenirs, though I had limited time and just glanced at the merchandise. They say you have to start at Kaminarimon and walk the long road to Senso-ji Temple for good luck. Well, won't lose something if we follow. So many people made the fountain on the side a photo op, while washing hands someone will take a photo of them. Well, it is a tourist spot afterall."

This was one of my favorite locations in Tokyo. Yes, it's crowded.

Do yourself a favor and visit during the evening hours for a more relaxing exploration. If not, then visit on the weekday. The weekends are even more insane!

As you might expect, the most touristy things are right in the market stalls leading directly to the temple, but the side streets all around are filled with interesting shops featuring everything from handmade brushes and combs to modern kimono and jinbei for men to toys, musical instruments, curtains/noren, etc. And snacks galore: mochi, waffles & ice cream, shaved ice, even when it isn't a festival day. When it is a festival day, a whole additional set of snack and eating stands opens up like at a state fair: fish and squid on sticks, frozen fruit, chocolate covered bananas, fried octopus balls, etc. The temple buildings and statues are beautiful and there are numerous nooks and crannies to explore with statues of historic figures and such.

If you pray for intelligence, you waft the incense over your head; if you want to ease the pain in a joint, wave some in that direction; if you hope to be more beautiful, it's your face... All manner of uses, and it smells divine!Beautiful temple. Best time to visit is late evening, as quieter (cooler, in summer months!) and you can see the lit up Tokyo Sky Tree from the gates!"

However I should admit it is beautiful and there is a nice and interesting procedure of making a wish - you have to pick a stick out of the metal container and then match the writing on the stick with the one on the small woden drawers. Open the drawer, take the piece of paper out and read it. It's like the fortune cookie, but a different type.The most interesting part for me was the market on the way to the shrine. You can get some gifts for friends or taste some yummy japanese sweets. They also have those famous owl cafes around there. Pretty sad to be honest. If you're an animal lover don't go there, you'll get upset."

I went twice to Senso Ji, first on a rainy day which stil had thousands the going around the stalls that lead to the temple and soaking up the rain and the atmosphere. Then again later on a mid week and less busy time, both times great fun for people watching and the stalls that are nearby are good. The temples are great to see and functioning, in contrast to the European cathedrals and churches which wake up on Sunday's only these are living vibrant places of worship. So one has to be respectful.It was great seeing all the kimono girls open to have their pictures taken when they weren't doing selfies. Good fun. And the rickshaw rangers in the roads nearby.I'd happily share pictures if I hadn't lost them all in a camera phone disaster. Oh the joys of travelSenso Ji - Well worth a visit"

Actually it's an old beautiful temple. And I am a huge fan of heritages. But why I don't really like this place as a temple? Because I can't find a peace ambience as a temple. People come from around the world to take pictures & buy souvenirs! Yes many visitors tried to do a simple ritual but they do it not in a silence situation. The worse situation is anyone can enter the temple to take pictures. And many of them using inappropriate costumes like hot pants. How can it happens in a temple!I usually find in other temple (South East Asia) that visitor must use appropriate costume to enter the temple. Sometimes the management borrow a sarong for visitors (like in Thai & Indonesia). I understood that this temple is in a public & open space so may be it's too hard to apply the same situations. But again, this is the temple! I am wondering do people (who really want yo pray here) bother or not by this crowd situation?Actually inside the temple there are some warning signs not to take picture. But.....the visitors never care about it (as long as I saw at that time). So sad :(.But talking about the souvenirs outside the temple.... He he he it's a heaven because we can find any kind of it and also Japanese snacks. And I love it very much :)."

            "review": "Tokyo's \"most famous\" temple :). Be sure to check out the left-side grounds of the Temple (the left side as you're facing the main temple building) and see the beautiful stream with colorful fish and a little stone bridge above and where you'll also see smaller shrines adding \"charm\" to the temple grounds. Apart from the main temple building, the other two prominent structures there are the five-storied pagoda (seemed to be off-limits to public or maybe it was just due to renovation when I was there) on the front-left side of the temple grounds and the Asakusa Shrine (that you get to by going through a torii gate) directly to the right of the main temple building. Might also want to drink water from the dragons' mouths right in front of the main building :). Also, something that should not be overlooked is the set of displays right outside the temple gate on the left side of the way leading to the Temple: those displays portray the history of the Temple as the two brother fishermen found a statue of Buddha in the Sumida River, they put it back but the statue kept turning up and they finally decided to build a shrine for the statue, as the story goes.The Temple's adjacent to Nakamise Market which is partly under long arch-shaped roofs & partly outdoors (but no outdoor hawkers or kiosks, just like house shops fronting the streets in the market area), and it's just about a five-minute walk north from Asakusa Station (Toei Asakusa Line & Metro Ginza Line). I even walked to Ueno Park from the gateway on the west side of the Temple, taking about 45 minutes (can take the Ginza Line too to Ueno Park from the nearby Asakusa Station as mentioned above).And my suggestion if you stay not too far from the Temple (like me who stayed at Khaosan Tokyo Original just about a ten-minute walk from the Temple) is to go there again in the evening after dark, and you'll see all the main structures (the entrance gate, the main temple building & the five-storied pagoda) brightly lit up."

Senso-ji is an amazing, bustling temple, with lots to see and the possibility of taking part in burning incense, getting a fortune told, making a prayer offering etc. The building is really quite something, and there's a buzzing atmosphere in the area. My only word of caution would be that the market beforehand is geared for tourists (obviously) and so unlike many other places in Tokyo it feels very touristy. Every stall is souvenirs, things to catch the eye of those from abroad, and it was the first place in Tokyo where I felt I needed to watch my bag.My tip would be to head for the gardens just behind the temple - there's a winding path through some lovely smaller temples, over a little stone bridge with koi carp in the water below. It's an entirely different atmosphere back there, very beautiful and calm."

The pagoda is really worth seeing when it is not obstructed by building works.Advice:- When finished, wander the streets to the West of the temple - these are full of smaller streets and have that traditional 'feel' about them."

We were lucky to be there when a movie was been shot so we saw a traditional Buddhist wedding procession going through the crowd with a carriage filled with musicians in traditional garb. You then proceed through another tall red gate, and get to the spot where you can shake tablets in a container, get a blessing, go to a small drawer to get the printed blessing that you keep or tie to strings in the temple. Then you move incense smoke from a large cauldron towards places in your body that are sick or painful.... then wash your hands with a bamboo laddle and climb the few stairs to view the central hall of the temple.

Coming out of the subway and walking down the tourist shop lane that leads to the temple was a bad sign. A temple to me should be peaceful and should not be so inundated with commercial shops selling cheap tourist souvenirs. Anyway, we braved our way through the crowds to the temple itself. The temple is nice, nothing spectacular though and its cramped. There is so little space around it. There are many ways to make wishes which is interesting to see and experience. However those can be experienced in other temples and shrines.I would recommend any traveler to go to the Meiji Shrine instead of this temple. The Meiji Shrine is Shinto while Senso-Ji is Buddhist so they represent different parts of the culture. But the Meiji Shrine is beautiful and peaceful, with stunning tall trees providing ample shade for a hot summer stroll. We did not really walk around in the streets outside of the temple. I did read there are some interesting artisanal shops in the area. I don't know if we missed anything worthwhile."

But it was the first full day of our trip so we were ready for it and took in some awesome people watching. Lot's of cool little junk shops on the way in. I imagine it's less busy early in the morning. We arrived around 10am. We saw many more temples on our trip and this one definitely had things that made it unique, particularly the giant lanterns. I would have loved to see it at night too, but we didn't go back.One thing that was disappointing is that the 5 story pagoda is hidden behind a scaffold for renovations right now, so we didn't get to see it at all. It would probably enrich the experience greatly to visit with an English speaking guide who can explain the customs and history behind some of the customs, charms, buildings, etc. We ended up educating ourselves about it pretty well once back at our hotel using the internet."

The temple had a peacefulness about it unlike the many pictures and videos taken and published that are packed with people. It was quite an unique feeling to have the grounds pretty much to yourself. I understand many like to visit it during dusk and at night as well.Of course, the many shops and stalls of Nakamise Dori were not opened that early. So one must return with the crowds to experience and taste that part of Asakusa.People were hurrying pass the Temple on their morning commute. To them, it was just another work day. But I was thrilled to walk through the Karinarimon Gate and see the giant sandals of the god. I came half way around the world to visit. Whether you go early, late or peak crowded hours, don't skip Sensoji and the Asakusa neighborhood. In the distance you can see the Tokyo Skytree. With the old and the new - side by side."

It was raining and foggy early in the morning and we scrapped our plans to visit the Tokyo Metropolitan Building because of poor visibility. Instead we took the subway to Asakusa. Arriving at Asakusa we walked towards Senso-ji Temple which is very close to the subway station. After leaving Exit 1 of Asakusa subway station you can see the Kaminarimon gate which leads to the very busy Nakamise dori which has small shops on both sides of the streets selling from souvenirs to food. We slowly made our way to the main temple entrance.The temple area was very crowded. It was cool to see a lot of locals visiting wearing traditional japanese dresses."

My only gripe was that there were far too many tourists for you to really enjoy but I guess that has become the norm for Asakusa. You would expect a temple to be a quiet, serene place but with the crowds, the vibe is actually quite lively and energetic. There was much activity going on in the place."

The only con is when you first arrive from the subway you're barraged with tour guides asking you if you want a tour. Be sure to go on an empty stomach plenty of food to sample along the way"

Lots of souvenir shops lining the streets and you will spot women in kimono attending the temple.The feel of \"worship\" is not there because of the abundance of tourists.Tip: if you're up for walking, walk to Ueno and walk along the kitchenware street (there you will see plastic food stores that only sells plastic food). Go to Tourist Information Centre right across Asakusa Subway Station for walking directions.Enjoy!"

It's a beautiful, impressive temple, welcoming many tourists daily, and it won't leave you disappointed. You can smell incense and light up some aroma sticks, make a wish (with more than one way). It is also a good opportunity to adore the Japanese in their national clothes, perhaps even take pictures with some. From certain spots you can see the Tokyo city center, and it creates an interesting contrast with traditional and modern Japan. A lively place with a bright spirit of the land of the rising sun will only leave good impressions."

The walk down past all the stalls was fun even though is was so congested. I loved all the statues, the huge bell, and all the side buildings as well as the main temple of course. We spent ages taking lots and lots of photos including plenty of all the women dressed in their beautiful kimonos."

You shall need 2h. including transport as it is in Asakusa, a bid out of central Tokyo. We were at the entrance at around 9am. on Sunday at it was already pretty crowed. When we came out around 1h. later, it was impossible to walk across the souvenirs street prior the main entrance of the temple. Have a look to those shops, you will certainly find something to bring back home at a very competitive prices.. No need to follow main street, go to the paralel street, less crowed and interesting things to find as well. It is a pity we could not see the pagoda, under renovation."

At the entrance, just off the street, is the very grand Thunder Gate (Kaminarimon). This houses one of the main tour book Tokyo sights, the huge red and black paper lantern. This apparently signifies thunderclouds and lightning. Once through the gate and beyond the sea of umbrella's was Nakamise-dori, a corridor of covered stalls selling crafts and food. At the other end is the Treasure House Gate (Hozomon) and the entrance to main temple. To the left is a stunning five level pagoda.

Then you walk through Nakamise -dori which is a pedestrian alley where you can get dolls, kimonos, hair combs, fans, etc. (most are not of the best quality and are mainly made to satisfy the tourist desire to get a Japanese souvenir). Then you go through the impressive Hozomon gate and you will find the incense burner where you should smoke the fumes to have good health. In front of it, you will see the main hall where you can see the kannon and many unique paintings of \"angels\" with lotto flowers. You have to see the hexagonal temple which is the oldest structure and only survivor of the original complex, the pagoda with the garden, and the awashima hall dedicated to a deity that protects women. Do not forget to touch the Nada Botokhesan Buddha as you will have good luck!The temple is relatively new when compared with many other temples in Japan as the original complex was destroyed during the second world war. The new complex resembles the original architecture and style. It is very big and nice.The entrance is free.The temple is impressive. The daily rituals make the visit to the temple special."

The architecture is amazing and the grounds the temple occupies are fairly large so the crowd disperses slightly.

We toured the main temple, the protecting thunder gate and the very crowded Nakamise shopping street. Many people in traditional kimonos along with the international tourists. As crowded as it was, the people were aware and respectful of others and we moved about without much trouble. At the end of Nakamise St. We found a 7-Eleven with an ATM that allowed us to use our debit cards with favorable exchange rates and fees. Rumi-san our guide explained that the people wearing masks were sick or suffering allergies and didn't want anything to spread - I always thought that they didn't want to catch something.

And, don't neglect all the little side streets off the main Nakamise shopping street, either- we bought some of our favorite items in these little shops. The temple is lovely at night- we timed our visit so we could visit the temple in daylight, do some shopping and eating, then visit the temple again after nightfall- it really was wonderful- like right out of a movie. We ended up with amazing photos. The Asakusa area is very much 'old Japan' feeling. It definitely has it's own unique charm. Not to be missed."

Sensoji Temple is a few steps from Asakusa Station, served by the Ginza Subway Line, Asakusa Subway Line and Tobu Railways. it is ALWAYS crowded and very touristy. Usually lots of school kids here so expect it to be noisy and somewhat frantic.When approaching the temple, you usually enter through the Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate), the outer gate of Sensoji Temple and the symbol of Asakusa and the entire city of Tokyo. However, the gate is currently (as of May 2016) completely enclosed in a box for what appears to be a renovation. A long shopping street consisting of tightly packed stalls and small stores, called Nakamise, leads from the outer gate to the temple's second gate, the Hozomon. Typical Japanese souvenirs such as yukata, t-shirts, mugs and folding fans are sold here, along with various traditional local snacks from the Asakusa area. I usually visit the Kane So knife shop on Willow Street behind the Nakamise and pick up some knives for myself and for gifts.My favourite part of the temple is getting my fortune. Deposit your hundred yen, shake the metal box until a stick falls out - and match the symbols on the stick to the symbols on the wood drawer containing your paper fortune. Fortunes are now available in both Japanese and English. ;o) For extra luck tie your fortune to the nearby stands.As a photographer I always find this place always has a lot of good subject matter for me. If you can tolerate the touristy nature and crowds, it is worth a look."

There's a little fountain where you can wash your hands, then buy some incense sticks to burn (as offering I guess) before you go into the shrine. That was very interesting for us."

The story is that it's customary for the Japanese parents to take their child to the temple to have them \"bathe\" in the smoke that is generated from the incense which will - by osmosis - make the child smarter and do better on their exams. Also, there are several \"sticks\" that is shaken and depending on the particular \"stick\" that falls out, you go to a corresponding box to read your \"fortune.\" In order to make the fortune come true, you then must tie the paper that the fortune is written on to a post/wire there at the temple. All in all, I probably mixed up the details but you get the point. There is a main thoroughfare that leads directly up to the Temple and it's lined with various shops selling souvenirs, drinks and ice cream. While there isn't much, it is worth the trip if you are in the neighborhood."

Our group went to see the Senso-ji Temple in Asakusa in May 2016, and we were overwhelmed by the beauty, traditions and the amounts of Japanese and other tourists that were there that day. True - we did visit during Japan's Golden Week, but this was the first huge crowd that we had come across in 4 days in Tokyo. The experience started as we disembarked from our subway train - the crowd was basically shuffling from the train to the entrance gate of Senso-ji - around 500m! But as soon as we neared the temple itself, the numbers began to dissipate and we were able to see the temple and its beautiful surrounds more clearly. I spent 100 yen and bought a paper fortune (omikuji). My first one was 'Bad Luck - Normal', but my second one was 'Best Ever Luck', so I tied my bad luck to the waiting racks and kept the good luck. We walked through the cleansing smoke in the cauldron near the temple, and then waited our turn to throw a coin in the temple shrine. The surrounding gardens, statues and flags were a delight to see!"

At that hour, it is easier to appreciate the architecture and the imposing mass of the temple that originally was built in about 645 AD. The current temple building is a reinforced concrete structure that preserves the original lines. The complex also includes the Asakusa Shinto shrine and a five-story pagoda. We enjoyed the activity of people seeking their fortune for 100 Yen at O-mikuji booths. Despite their reputation for offering many interesting things, we were unable to find souvenirs that suited our taste in the shops of Nakamise Street. Nevertheless they were very popular with visitors and they provided a bottleneck in the flow of tourists. We feel that this temple complex was the high point of our visit to Asakusa."

We went at Cherry Blossom time so there were many stalls round the temple selling things on sticks (chicken, octopus, fish, bananas and a great many other things unfamiliar to Western palates). And of course cherry blssom much in evidence. Because of the number of people, it's hard to feel anything spiritual, but the buildings are beautiful and everyone is very respectful.The street leading up to the temple, Nakamise-dori, is teeming with souvenirs galore, I'm sure some overpriced, but equally some beautiful and just what you're looking for!The whole thing is a great experience and will easily take up a morning."

A street market lines the main thoroughfare to the main temple gates, where more food carts lie beyond.Once you climb up the temple steps though, you will encounter an almost puzzling serenity in the inner section of the temple, where serious devotees and robed monks pray and meditate.Your visit to Senso-ji shouldn't end at the main temple. Wander around the connecting roads towards the west and you will find a pleasant shopping street that leads to other smaller temples and shrines."

Once the stick dropped from tube you just have to match the numbers on the stick and the drawers. Good thing there is a English version of the fortune so you don't have to crack your brain reading the Japanese!!!Treat for the ladies: the rickshaw pullers in front of the temple are eye candy :)"

The temple premises were extremely crowded but it was a worthwhile visit that gave us a good glimpse of Japanese culture.The temple buildings are ancient and very interesting and depict ancient Japanese architecture. Part of the temple was not open to non members and there was some function happening. Not all areas could be photographed but there are signs where photos are not allowed. The temple is a very touristy place and there are various ways they collect money. There are market stalls and food stalls all around the temple which make good salesThere was a very festive atmosphere with a lot of young girls in traditional kimono trotting along and photographing themselves. There were also a few wedding parties."

However a small offering is required for this and I would suggest taking plenty of 100 yen coins.Also don't miss the chance to visit the Denbo gardens which are part of the complex, not only are the gardens beautiful and much more peaceful than the rest of the temple, the entrance fee also includes a small museum fill with artefacts and paintings related to the temple."

It took me quite some time to reach the temple even it is just a short distance. On the way to the temple, there are many souveniers stalls on both sides of the street but they are too small to fit in the crowd at one time. The temple itself is beautiful and definitely worth a visit. However, if you are going to other temples, please think twice before buy the amulet there as they are quite expensive compared to other places. If and only if there is less people, Senso-ji temple would be a wonderful place for praying and enjoy the tranquility around the temple."

However even then there were quiet places, the Hikan Inari shrine was quiet and peaceful for the most part. Of a night though the place has an entirely different character.

In the initiate area you'll find food stands as well a long road of shops on Nakamise street where you can pick up some souvenirs andtry some local flavors. Try coming early if you despise crowds because it will be packed by noon. I found most shops open by 10am. One can definitely see the interesting mix of Edo architecture, modern architecture and postmodern architecture in Asakusa. Absolutely worth visiting."

            "review": "Definitely one of the best temples to visit in the Kanto region. In Asakusa is where Senso-ji Temple (or Asakusa Kannon Temple) is located.The legend of the temple is that in the year 628, two brothers who were fishing, retrieved the statue of Kannon (the Goddess of Mercy) out of the Sumida River. Each time they put the statue back in the river, it would keep coming back to them. So, Sensoji was built nearby for the Goddess of Kannon.When you arrive, the first temple you will most likely see is the Komagatado Hall. A location where the statue of Bodhisattva Kannon was found and marks the origins of the temple. This hall is only available for public viewing on the 19th of every month. A major festival is held on April 19th.Also, right at the front is the Kaminarimon Gate and you will see the Fuji (wind god) and Raijin (thunder god) at the left and right side of the gate.As you continue to walk up, you will be greeted by the huge Hozomon Gate ~Niomon Gate~. Built in 942 by military commander Taira no Kinmasa, he offered prayers at Senso-ji in hopes of becoming the lord of Musashi province (Tokyo) and built the gate for his wishes to come true.But like many of the structures in this area, they were destroyed by fires and rebuilt again and again. This current version was rebuilt after it was burned down during the World War II Tokyo air raids of March 1945 (the previous structure was built in 1649).Once you get to the rear,you will reach the Main Hall ~Kannondo Hall~ which is a national treasure built by third Edo shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu but unfortunately was obliterated in the Air Raids of World War II in 1945. The hall was reconstructed in 1958 and mirrors the original stall but with solid reinforced concrete structures and titanium roof tiles.To the left is the five-story pagoda build in 942 and another building lost to fire and reconstructed. It was declared a national treasure in 1911, destroyed during the World War II Air Raids and reconstructed and rebuilt in 1973. This version now features facilities for mortuary tablets and relics.And as you proceed further right, you will then reach Asakusa Jinja Shrine.Asakuksa Shrine was commissioned by Tokugawa Iemitsu and constructed in 1649 during Japan\u2019s Edo period and uses the gongen-zukuri style of architecture.The small Shinto shrine honores the three individuals (two brothers, fishermen Hinokuma Hamanari and Hinokuma Takenari and the wealthy warlord named Haji no Nakatomo) who were involved in the founding of Senso-ji.It was run as part of the Senso-ji Shrine but is now ran independently.Also, unlike other temples that were bombed and rebuilt, the architecture constructed in 1649, during feudal times did survive the World War II air raids.Overall, the trip to Senso-ji Shrine is breathtaking and no doubt one of the best temples to visit in the Kanto region.Made in the year 645, the temple is Tokyo\u2019s oldest temple."

Feel invited to stroll the long rows of concession stands that flank the approach to the main temple building over a distance of ca. 300 meters (1000 ft).Bonus tip: if you happen to be in Tokyo at the end of April do not miss the baby sumo! Officially it is called Nakizumo (from naku - to cry) and it involves babies held by real sumo wrestlers in one-on-one bouts. Winner is the first one to cry.

I stayed in Taito, Tokyo during my very first visit to Japan just this past January (2016), specifically in Iriya, so I knew Asakusa and Senso-ji were nearby & walkable. Thankfully it was a very nice day for walking. I was searching for great ramen (stomach first before anything else) when I stumbled on to Senso-ji Temple. PLUSES: So many temples in 1 place! And really old ones, too. This is Japan. Architecturally, you can't go wrong with these amazing temples either. Nakamise Street definitely lives up to its fame, too. Lots of fun. I especially liked the bean paste dessert which were freshly made (but not their policy that you HAVE to eat it where it's made). MINUSES: None, except for that old lady who chastised me for eating the bean paste dessert in the wrong area. I forgot! LOL! However, the crowd may be too much for some. I went there on a Wednesday, early afternoon, yet it was still packed. I didn't mind it and I thought it added to the atmosphere. SUMMARY: Senso-ji Temple is a mix of the revered and the commercial, old school Japan still very much alive in modern day Tokyo. If it's your first time in Tokyo and want to see temples but don't have much time, Senso-ji is highly recommended. TIP: Half a day per location/attraction is my rule of thumb for Tokyo in terms of how much time to devote to a place. I have to say though that I spent most of my day here as I enjoyed Senso-ji a lot! Realistically, you can do 3 hrs. if you're rushing but at least 4 hrs. is ideal I think."

There were souvenirs and Japanese snacks all along the pathway leading to the temple.I definitely spent more time at the shops than I did at the actual temple! I recommend drawing out an Omikuji (100 yen), showing you your fortune. I was lucky enough to get a Daikichi (very good fortune). A stroll through the garden was also refreshing, and beautiful in the afternoon. While you're at Asakusa, you must also take a glimpse of the Sky Tree and the Asahi Flame. You can get a really good view of both figures. The contrast between the traditional old Japan and the futuristic modern Japan is another thing that I love, and can be experienced here."

We visited the Temple on a public holiday celebrating the coming of age and it was absolutely packed with locals. The temples and the Pagoda were beautiful and the walk up towards the temple was fantastic with a giant lantern first, then the alleyway lined with interesting market stalls, then the entry. All stunning picture perfect. This entire area is free and is alive day and night. There was lots of incense burning and the different types of incense signified different things and money was thrown for good fortune in a specific part of the temple. As it was exceptionally busy there were long line to enter but it didn't take long and it was well worth the wait. The sea of people around these buildings was incredible. The Pagoda and temple are well worth the visit."

About 15-minute train ride from Tokyo station, (20 from Shinjuku, 30 from Shibuya or just 5 from Akihabara).Take Marunouchi Line to Ginza (which is only 1 stop) then from Ginza takes you straight to Asakusa. Walking out of the station, we ran into a rickshaw (tuk tuk) so we decided to hop on and our guide was AWESOME! He took us around Asakusa and to Sensoji Temple, his knowledge in history and the area made our ride so much better. Definitely worth the money to hop on one of these. All the guides are very nice, courteous, and super efficient.You will see a lot of people walking around in Yukata's, which was awesome! Be aware though, it get super SUPER CROWDED! We came here on a Tuesday around lunch time and it was full of foreigners. If you don't like crowds, highly recommend to try and come and not a popular time. Sens\u014d-ji s an ancient Buddhist temple located in Asakusa. It's Tokyo's oldest temple, and pretty cool if I might say. There is Nakamise shopping street aka Nakamise-d\u014dri (Kaminarimon) right nearby and it's insanely huge! A LOT and I mean A LOT of places to shop at or restaurants to try out! We tried Sushi Go Round, it's a conveyer belt sushi place and was AMAZING! Everything was literally $1-$3 a plate! Great area to shop for gifts as well =)It was pretty surreal being here, like a dream come true type of feeling ^_^"

You may visit their tourist information area in front of the first big red door you see in the photo. As far as I can remember this door is translated as 'lightning or electric door\" from my Chinese. anyway, it's really a picturesque view! take lots of photos. from the door, you'll see some stores selling both souvenirs, mochi balls (i suggest you try), sugar can juices, and other food! You walk to the opposite side where you'll see the main temple. There's an area where incense is being lit. They say you \"surround\", \"inhale\" (?) or \"push\" the air towards you because they believe it can give you more knowledge. you can also light your incense if you buy them at a booth. If you're into looking at the shops and take your time, I'd suggest you allot at least an hour at this area. If you're just into photos and a fast look at the area, 30 minutes will do."

But I was not expecting the crush of people. We were there around noon - and if and when we return, it will be around 9 or 10 before most of the crowds.

In front of the main hall is a large cauldron with incense smoking. People are surrounding the area so that the smoke drifts on them. The smoke is supposed to bring good health.The Kannon which is quite small is supposed to be inside the main hall and not in view. People throw coins and pray. Behind the gates inside, there was a service with people chanting and a man beating a drum.There is a fortune telling area prior to entering the Main Hall. It is requested that a person donates 100 yen into a container. Shake a canister that has long sticks and then let one fall out. There are characters on the stick and match it to the same character on the drawer. Instead the drawer will be either a good or not so good fortune. The fortune is written in English as well. If it isn't a good fortune, tie the paper on the nearby rack and do it again.There are many very reasonably priced souvenir shops lining the streets. Be adventuresome and try some unusual food. Also, we bought hot coffee in a can from a vending machine for 80 yen which was quite good. I would recommend going mid morning before the swell of crowds appear."

There is no direct train access from Shinjuku where we stayed, so we had to change several subway lines which are basically very easy to navigate due to an excellent public transport infrastructure in Japan. We also used our Google Map to navigate our way through. The place is strikingly beautiful, with its Kaminarimon gate visible from far away (you won't miss it). You may find arrays of smalll shops along the Nakamise-Dori before reaching the Sensoji Temple itself. Be prepared to spend a fair bit of money here as most of the souvenirs and snacks are pretty hard to resist. There are some restaurants and small cafe selling different kind of food and drinks.The complex area is a photographer heaven too. You can literally spend a few hours here.Avoid school holidays as this place can be very packed."

Inside the shrine, there is one main hall, where people pray, worship, and make offerings. Right outside the main hall, there are many shops, selling lucky charms and offering fortune telling (self served). For fortune telling, one needs to prepare 100 Japanese Yen, put it in the offering slot, shake the stick tubes till one comes out, find the drawer with corresponding number, then get a paper with the readings on it. If it is a good fortune, congratulations! If it is bad, one can tie it on the side, and the workers at the shrine will collect these bad fortunes, pray over them, then burn them. Either way, one should not be worried. There are MANY food options in the outer area of the shrine. Recommend the octopus balls! They are delicious! 500 Yens for 6 of them, and they fill one up well! My husband and I shared 6 balls, and we were full. Try other things too!"

I guess everyone who has been to both Tokyo and Kansai (Osaka and Kyoto) agrees that the latter smells more Japanese than the former.

Not only is it one of the largest temples in the capital, the covered alleys in front of it are swamped with restaurants and shops. I am sure you can spend an entire afternoon there! Simply take Ginza Line to the terminal (Asakusa) and you will find the temple easily."

Alongside one can find eateries offering small tid bits and drinks, but you can't eat while walking. I saw Japaneses people offering money to the temple and also praying for good health. The temple itself is very beautiful with various statues and decorations. Really colorful and eye catching.

Wander along the street market, trying the different foods along the way, before walking through the main entrance gate into Senso-ji. Buy some incense from one of the vendors (c.100 yen) and place it in the central incense urn. You will see a lot of locals rubbing the incense smoke into their clothes (for good luck) - it smells nice but it won't come out for weeks! Well worth it for the experience though. There are a number of smaller temples inside the main precinct which are worth a visit too. Also, the water fountain (for washing your hands) is impressive and well worth a look."

The subway station is filled with old Japanese artifacts, you get the feeling that you are on the way to a historic place. If you're going from central Tokyo the subway is a very convenient to go to Senso-ji!The whole area feels really \"old\" in a good way, it feels like seeing how Japan could look 1000 years ago. However, it also feels a bit commercialized with all the shops etc. on Nakamise street. We were there during Golden Week so it was very crowded as well.After doing a bit of shopping we continued to the temple itself. When we were there there was a Shinto priest in there praying behind a net so that people could watch. The hall is full of art as well. Outside to the left is a nice garden and just bit from the temple is a tasty melon-pan restaurant called \"Asakusa Kagetsudo Honten\" which is definitly worth a visit! In addition, it's possible to walk to Tokyo Sky Tree from Senso-ji which is nice.The reason why this for me isn't a 5/5 experience is a lack of things to do in my opinion, compared to some other destinations in Tokyo. I felt it's simply the temple and shopping and not so much more. But I absolutely do not regret visiting it and it should be on any Tokyo tourist's route!"

The long street that leads up to the main temple has tons of interesting shops that sell souvenirs and street food, one of the dango shops (with a bunny mark on it) seemed to be very popular. There are hidden shops here and there around the corners - we found a melonpan shop and it turned out to be great!The actual temple is magnificent with its huge red lanterns and tall towers. There was a giant incense pot releasing smoke from the entrance, and it seems like it's a tradition for the locals to get close to breathe in the incense / fan it towards their face. They also have booths with street food and Japanese charms - overall, a lot to see and explore. Don't miss it if you're around asakusa!"

Alight at the Asakusa subway station and exit via Exit 1. Once on street level, turn right and walk about 3 minutes. At the end of the row of shops and restaurants, you will find the entrance to the temple. It is impossible to miss the gate because of a huge red lantern hanging above the entrance.Many retail shops line the way on both sides of the walkway into the temple. Visitors can buy souvenirs, snacks and gifts while visiting the temple. A word of advise for foreign visitors to Tokyo, please do not eat or drink while on the go. It is deemed as rude and a socially undesirable thing to do so. Therefore, upon purchase of a snack or drink which is intended for immediate consumption, please move along to a quiet spot or away from the main thoroughfare to eat and drink privately.The colors of the decorations, buildings and merchandise on sale make the entire visit to the temple a very vibrant and pleasant one. It is a very crowded place on a daily basis. Be prepared for a tight squeeze at certain locations along the way.I highly recommend this venue for visitors to Tokyo."

Yes, it will be pack but interesting thing here is you are able to see shops selling snacks and able to see how they make them.

The street is lined with shops selling souvenirs and many different food stalls selling different types of Japanese snacks. At the temple you can pay 100 yen for your fortune. Shake the box, pull out a long stick with a number and find your fortune in the box with that number marked. If it is good, keep it. If it is bad then tie it to the rack nearby and say goodbye to your bad fortune..Very busy but a must-visit."

The most famous shrine in Japan, a picture with the big red lantern with wording of 'lightning gate' \u96f7\u9580 is the most Japan thing to do.There's many things to do and see around Sensoji. You can go to the viewing deck across sensoji for a photo of the wholr Nakamesi st to the temple, you can eat all those local delicacies they sell along the street, and you can even rent Kimono to walk around the area up to 4 hrs.Do go in the shrine and try out the fortune stick and see what is your fortune like. Just place 100 yen and shake until a stick with number comes out, go to the tiny drawers according to the number on your stick. The paper you get tells your fortune, and it has english explanation at the back.If you do not get a good fortune told, fold the paper and tied it to the iron poles nearby so that it will not come true :PThey also sell lucky charms for health, safety, study and etc available. It's really nicely done, a good choice for souvenir. Happy exploring!"

The religious sites elsewhere in Japan are much more impressive, as Tokyo is more of a metro city. Still, the senso-ji area is very close to the metro line and in the vicinity of the skytree and waterboat area. Plus there are some markets for shopping and food afterwards. The place is pretty busy with tourists but all the little monuments and shrines get little attention. The markets go for a while but are pretty much filled with souvenir shops for the most part- the ones nearest to the main temple and along the side streets are filled with the more unique items."

Not only is the temple easily accessible by Asakusa station, it has two main pedestrian roads leading up to it that we found to be the best in terms of buying a wide range of souvenirs- we also felt the rpices were great too. Most of us actually went back specifically to these roads to shop. The temple itself is beautiful, pay attention to the fountain on the side and the ceiling painting on the inside. Closer to the temple entry theres many food stalls, and though we tried most of the food there was nothing to rave about - probably save your stomach for a proper lunch nearby. There's plenty of vending machines and a area to sit with toilets on your right. There's also a road perpendicular to the temple which is enclosed and provides more bargain shopping & restaurants. Overall a good day spent in the area."

I never get tired of The Senso-jii Temple (also known as the Asakusa Kannon) still a much visited temple. Its been around since 628 AD but the building you see today was built in 1945. Has an interesting story. They say two fishermen brothers 'caught' a small gold statue of Kannon, the goddess of mercy and happiness. Then the temple was built in Kannon's honor. My son loves to get his 'fortune'. You will see little boxes on your right side as you approach and you will see people shaking the can and pulling out their fortune stick. Then you go to the drawer and pull out your fortune. Just put the 100 yen coin in first. The papers are in English as well and my son still has his fortune. :) What I love about the temple is MANY MANY people milling about..some Japanese women in full kimono dress. There are amazing statues and one time when we were there we came upon a big food festival with tons of food including chocolate dipped bananas! If you only have a short time in Tokyo you should make this your first destination I think. Also if you have a few days pick a day that isn't raining if that is possible and you will enjoy it more. The street leading up to it is filled with little fun shops by the way. All outdoor. If you go on a rainy day the side streets are covered Atriums so don't despair."

It is Tokyo's major Buddhist temple and as such a bustling melting pot of locals and tourists, and in complete contrast to the serenity and birdsong of Meiji-jingu. The first surprise on passing through the initial gate with its guardians either side is Nakamisedori, a street of shops on either side of the walkway! Much is tourist fodder but I bought a nice pair of birth year chopsticks (in fact, I bought rabbit because it looked nicer than my actual birth year animal, which involved convincing the vendor that that really was my birth year!).On the left as you approach the main temple building is a five-storey pagoda, which is worth a look, as well as observing the washing and incense rituals that the locals are observing. The main building is impressive, though not as attractive as some other temples within a day trip of Tokyo, such as at Nikko. Once there, I recommend taking a fortune by donating 100 \u00a5, shaking a stick from the metal containers and matching the number on the stick to the corresponding drawer, which will contain a paper fortune with English text as well as Japanese. On this visit, I had an excellent good fortune - on my first trip years ago I was advised not to travel in the near future!On leaving, I was met by a small group of school children who had clearly been tasked with asking questions of gaijin in English (though I did help with a bit of Japanese), who have me a small token of their appreciation when finished. Very sweet :)Don't go expecting a similar experience to a shrine - the very contrast is a big part of a visit to Senso-ji."

So, going to see Senso-ji alone may not be worth the trip but spending a couple of hours in the area as a whole should definitely be on your Tokyo trip agenda. Oh, and you should time your trip, if you can, to visit when the Asakusa Samba Carnival festival is happening; I think it is in August. Couple of years ago I was there for it and by no means is it Rio but it is still fun to see."

If you take the Sumida River cruise it is very close to access when you get off the boat. There are incense burners and a purification process for the Buddhist who flock to this temple to participate. It is interesting to watch them and then to stroll along the pedestrian lane lined with many shops (almost like a flea market) that leads to the temple. It provides an atmosphere of Old Tokyo to help balance the sights of newer Tokyo. We took several really nice photos of women in kimonos, children playing in the street, and other activities.

Some tourist attractions are so gimmicky and not worth it due to crowds or being blown out of proportions, but Senso-ji deserves it's popularity. Senso-ji temple located in Asakusa, Tokyo is in one word a marvel. The story states that long ago in the year 628 two brothers had fished a statue of the goddess of mercy out of the Sumida river. Each time they put the statue back into the river somehow it would return to them. Sensoji was built for the goddess of mercy, Kannon. Being Tokyo\u2019s oldest temple and just the sheer size of it make it a popular tourist destination. When you near the main building wash yourself with the incense smoke to gain good health. Towards the temple itself there is a gigantic paper lantern and I mean gigantic. You can also ask the oracle a question by offering a suggested donation of 100 yen. There are 100 possible drawers and your answer is retrieved from one of them. If you want a visual look check out the web series Japan VS by vahidrvahidr on youtube. If the temple wasn\u2019t enough entertainment and/or you\u2019re hungry there are hundreds of stalls that lead from the second temple gate to it\u2019s outer gate. You\u2019ll be able to get your food and souvenirs if you are so inclined. Have a great trip!"

At night it's far more quiet than at daytime ( during which you should visit and stroll also) and there is just something magical about the setting! Makes you forget you're in a big city! Watch the locals come up to the Temple and throw coins in a \"box\" and say a small prayer!"

I walked up Nakamise Street past all the vendors and went straight to the temple.I made sure to purify myself before entering the temple and used the 5y coins with the holes in them for my donation to the temple. I bowed my head and said a short prayer and paid my respects to my ancestors.I was surprised that there were a lot of people at the temple at 10:00am in the morning. There were several groups of school kids on an excursion as well, and I followed them along to see what they were doing. One group had small coloring pads around their necks and their teacher would stop at several locations, give them a brief lecture and then the kids would make drawings of the item that they had just seen. Cool!!I also went down some of the side street from Nakamise Dori, and those side street are the best. I bought some rice crackers and some bean cake.to give to friends. Good Omiyage. I also ran across a film crew that was filming something for a Japanese program. They had blocked off a part of the street so I turned around and went back to Nakamise Dori. I wasn't too interested in that, since I don't know anyone in Japan TV or movies.I had a terrific time at both Senso-ji Temple and Nakamise Dori, and it was a good way to see an important blend of 21st century technology and older ways of life."

The temple was beautifully lit at night along with other temple buildings and even the Tokyo sky tree which we could see nearby.We brought a Combi stroller for our little one (almost 5 at the time) which proved to be a good choice, because he tired himself out running around with mum, as he slept in it on the commute back to our place.

Me and my boyfriend both for a bad fortunes so we tied it up with the others and asked for better luck next time!(2) buy some incense and add to the giant pot of incense. It'll make your clothes and hair smell for a few hours, but great part of the culture and apparently good for your health!(3) wash your hands/face with water from the fountainThe temple itself is lively and quite impressive, we also stumbled upon a plum wine festival around the corner. Look out for people dressed as ninjas and geishas! One more thing, I had some yakisoba from a food stalls just outside (I'm always wary of street vendors, but it smelt great and I'd not seen yakisoba advertised anywhere else yet!) and it was lovely. I'd ask for no shrimps if I had it again though (they're dried and put on top, as they smelt quite strong I avoided that third of the noodles!!)"

Also please be respectful of the no photo signs. I saw so many taking pictures when you were not suppose to and that is disrespectful of the culture, the shop owners, and people worshiping."

Some of the special significance days can be really terribbile and the place is packed to the limits with people wanting to make an offer at the temple. The rows of shops in the surrouding area are very touristy and oftern quite expensive. sometimes it pays to walk about 100 metres away from the main arcade area and wander into some of the smaller side streets with little shops that are often overlooked, here you can find some nice little bargains and the shopkeepers are less stressed than in the overflowing torurist area.

We were there in Silver Week in September. The crowd was so huge that we were pushed along. We didn\u2019t even bother going near the temple. We went back another day when it was not a holiday.Our son enjoyed sniffing the incense, pouring the water over his hands to purify them, and the fortune sticks (100 yen, you shake the silver metal cylinder until a stick comes out and then match the symbol on the stick with the fortune paper in the drawer. If it\u2019s bad luck, you tie it on the nearby strings.) There are clean toilets a short walk to the right of the temple.The markets have a good range of souvenirs and gifts. This is good if your time is limited and you won\u2019t have time to shop. However I found bags that I bought at the temple were 100 yen cheaper at the Hello Kitty store, and erasers were cheaper in the stationery and toy shops at Ginza. Wander into the side streets and you may see people making rice crackers and sweets. There are some great photo opportunities.You\u2019ll most likely see ladies in kimonos while wandering around the temple. When we asked, they were happy to pose for photos with our son. We took some souvenirs from home (fluffy koala and kangaroo key rings) and gave these to them as a token \u2013 which they seemed to really appreciate.There is a small children\u2019s playground near the Temple \u2013 to the right of it (not far from the toilets) but heading back towards the Kaminarimon gate. We didn\u2019t find many playgrounds in Tokyo, so even though it is a bit drab, our son really appreciated being in a playground.A bit further along from the Temple, we enjoyed delicious treats from The Custard Lab (in the same street as the Rox building) \u2013 one of the yummiest things I ate in Japan! There is a rabbit caf\u00e9 (\u201cWith Bunny\u201d) and a bird caf\u00e9 within the vicinity of the temple, if this is your thing."

Seriously, if you are looking for something that tells you that \"yeah, I've been to Japan\" you will find it here. There are dozens of small shops here, all selling their unique or not-so-unique wares, mostly at a friendly price. The sellers speak the basic English, at least at the places we have been to. We didn't try to bargain, but maybe you can; it's up to You to find that out. Also, look for the shop where you can do a buy 5 shirts get 1 free for a really low price, absolutely worth it!About the temple(s):This temple was the people's back in the days, it was free for them to visit, and nowadays it stood true to this philosophy. You can get in for free, get a good look around, and just chill. We are not that into religion, still found it to be really pleasant.To sum it up: visit this place if you are in Tokyo!"

This was the second time we visited this temple and we were just as impressed!Located in the historic Asakusa district of Tokyo, this temple attracts foreign and Japanese tourists alike and was just as busy when we had visited previously in Winter. Like most other major Similar and temples in Japan, there is a long path leading up to the entrance which is lined by souvenir and food shops ( most of which are expensive). The most interesting sight is the ritual performed by the large numbers of local visitors, who all buy incense to place into the large incense pot, purify themselves in its smoke and then go up to into the temple to pray."

It was about a 15 minute or less walk from the Asakusa station to the entrance to the temple. Upon entering the temple, you could feel it's spiritual nature. The place felt very serene. Very peaceful and calming. There are quite a few sites to see in and around the temple grounds. You can also purchase beaded bracelets that have the name of the temple (Senso-ji) inscribed in kanji. They cost anywhere from $8-16 USD. I believe the proceeds go towards maintaining the temple. Well worth it in my opinion. You will see an interesting fountain shrine that has water flowing out of it. People are seen washing their hands and also drinking the water. People were also seen burning what seemed to be white sage and saying a prayer. Then they would put the sage in a pot of sand. (See the pictures) Once you are finished walking around the temple and the ground, you can head out the back exit and you will see a street lined on both sides with food and souvenir vendors. There were a lot of yummy snacks to be had as well as souvenirs to be bought. I sampled a few of the sweets and my family bought some things to take home. No one pressured you to buy anything. That is not the Japanese culture. It was a very nice time. I hope to visit the temple again one day. This is truly a must see if you are visiting Tokyo.Positives:EverythingNegatives:NothingWould see again?:Absolutely, without a doubt.Thinks to remember:Lots of walking and bring an umbrella. The weather can be unpredictable. Bring a bag to carry any sweets or souvenirs."

Visit on a weekday when there are much less people. I managed to capture a shot of the main gate in the evening when the crowd was gone. The stalls lining the path towards the main shrine are filled with the usual travel souvenirs and local snacks. After a visit to the temple, try exploring the alleys on both sides of the temple. There are plenty of snack shops and restaurants here. One particular one I like is a shop on the east side of the temple, selling Taiyaki, a Japanese fish-shaped cake that is filled with sweet red-bean paste. This shop offers other flavors but my favourite was the peach one. These are freshly baked and the shop is very generous with the fillings.

What a magnificent experience visiting this the oldest temple in Tokyo, with a history going back to 628 when two brothers found the statue of Kannon in their net while fishing in the Sumida River. The head of there village then turned his home into a small temple so people could come and pray to Kannon and as they say the rest is history. Now 30 million visitors a year come to visit this lovely Buddhist temple. It is worth the while to read it's history. When you walk through the grand entry with the huge red and black lantern hanging in the centre you are confronted with Nakamise Dori [street], this street lead you up to the temple which will take you a while not only because of the crowd of people but because the shops on either side of the street are soo interesting you will want to look in all of them. They have been here for generations selling to the visitors since pilgrims walked from all over Japan and beyond to worship to Kannon. You can just about buy any gift you want here and so many food places selling really traditional Japanese food. This is an amazing area and lots of fun.When you finally get to the temple you will be impressed, this place had the support of the Shogun from way back in the Kamakura period to the Edo Era so became wealthy and became the centre of Edo culture. There are lots of nice statues about the grounds and a lovely five story pagoda, it is all very imposing and colourful, one takes a lot of photos. You must visit this very historical temple when you are in Tokyo."

Saying that it was brilliant as everyone was in a joyous mood and the number of people in traditional costume made it all look so colourful. The temple was one of the places everyone went to at the end of a long row of market stalls. Being Buddhist there were the differences to be kept from the Shinto temples we'd visited so we had to be careful. It is a grand old temple and well worth a look and the 'party' atmosphere made it all the more pleasurable."

There were lots of visitors when we went but due to the extremely hot weather it wasn't as crowded as I've seen posted. To get here from the station is a little confusing as there are lots of streets that branch off. Luckily we found a fellow tourist who guided us. It's a short walk and you walk thru tons of little shops to purchase food products or souvenirs. Take your time and look at each vendor. They sell similar items so purchase it after you come out of the temple so you won't have to carry it with you, The temple is amazing and provides lots of opportunity for photo ops and to receive blessings by water (do not drink directly from the scooper...you dip the scooper in the water and pour it over the hand you will drink from then you pour water into your hand to drink...never put your lips to the scooper), smoke from incense (stand near it and wave the smoke over you), and you can also purchase amulets or fortunes, too. Definitely check out the large slippers that hang on the shrine. These are handmade and change about once every twenty years and replaced. Just a beautiful place to view and enjoy treats."

I visited on a humid and hot day when Nakamise Dori, the medieval shopping street leading to the temple, was bursting at the seams. Although the temple is closed at night, one can walk around the gardens and the buildings. In spring the area is bright with sakura (cherry blossoms), and it is reputed to be beautiful even in winter.The main temple contains a reproduction of the Kannon (Chinese: Guanyin; Indian: Avalokiteshwara) statue which, according to legend and paintings in the Nakamise Dori, was fished up from the sea and established here in the early medieval period. The original cannot be viewed. The coffers in the ceiling have five beautiful paintings. The small garden outside has a lovely stream with koi, and a large statue of the Buddha in which he looks Indian.Also of interest are the five-story tower off to the left and the enormous lanterns which hang in the gates at the two ends of the Nakamise Dori: the Kamarimon and the Hozomon. Mitarashi dango (grilled rice balls with sweet fillings) is the traditional speciality which must be eaten here. If you are in the market for souvenirs, then Nakamise Dori is a reasonable place to buy them."

Despite the massive tourist crowds, the temple was absolutely beautiful, and kept a sense of peacefulness and respect inside the main temple doors. A 200m long market leads from the entrance of Senso-Ji to the main temple. This is by far the best market/tourist shopping spot we found around Tokyo, so I would definitely recommend including some shopping time into your plan. The best thing about this market is that none of the shop owners are hawking their products, making the experience incredibly painfree. There are several different sites around the temple where people are throwing coins for good luck, so make sure you have some handy. A beautiful way to experience both a sacred temple, as well as some shopping."

We were glad we did because apart from the beautiful shrine, temple, grounds and frenetic main shopping street, we would have missed the lesser-known sights such as the handprints of Japanese celebrities, located nearby.Afterwards, we spent time walking along the smaller streets which crisscross near the temple. There are many small shops selling everything from kimonos and kitchen wares to very reasonably-priced restaurants filled with locals.We visited during the two day festival of the Hozuki-ichi (ground cherry pod flowers). The grounds were alive with flower sellers and food stalls. Once the rain stopped, it was a beautiful sight.

We visited Sensoji Temple early in the morning before it is enveloped by tourists from all walks of life. Many locals visit Sensoji early in the morning to offer prayers and to go about their daily lives. There are a lot of pedestrians and cyclists passing by the temple grounds. I was there to infuse myself in a little dose of culture and to kill time before Nakamise dori (street) came to life. As with most places of religious worship, I feel at peace here. Be respectful of temple visitors and not use your camera flash while inside temple interior."

It looks very well kept and the market stalls going up to the temple create such a lively and bustling walkway. It would be hard not to buy anything from here!Not much to see inside the shrine but the whole experience is still good. At the back of one of the gates are two giant flipflops that allegedly bring good luck to walkers. On the right hand side of the shrine are public restrooms at street level. Just behind some trees."

We reached on Fri late night and back on Sunday late night too.It is my first time to Tokyo and Sensoji Temple is my 2nd stop after Tsukiji Market. We managed to find it quite easily after come out from Asakusa of Tokyo Metro Line.As advised by online, we manage to see the craved dragon beneath the 1st lantern in center of the Gate.Lots people taking pictures. I love the First view after the 1st Gate. two rows of small stalls all the way to the Shrine Hall. Full of people in between the stalls.Dont forget to turn back to see the Gigantic straw slipper on the gate upon entering the 1st gate.We saw a stall selling the variety of ice cream on our right side which cost about 300 yen.We tried the Green tea flavour. Not bad. just the cons is we have to finish up the WHOLE ice cream before we move to the next stall. We respect their cleanliness. therefore, my advice is please buy them after you visited all unless you are very thirsty or hot.Along the row of stalls, we saw shops of souvenir,food and snacks. There is also a row of prediction papers where people ask for the love,luck and etc stuff. More closer to the shrine hall, on the right,we saw people crowd around a fountain of a statue and wash their hand, drank some of the water and put some water on their head. We didn't managed to get to know the name of the Statue but it is quite a view.There is a Pagoda on the left, it is said have lots of nice wall painting on the ceiling. due to limited time, we skipped climbing up the stairs. But i will definitely go up the Pagoda in my next visit.After paying respect at the Shrine hall, we turn to our right and there is a Hall for the Ancestor. We exited at the right side of the Temple to talk a walk by the riverside."

We booked our hotel in Asakusa so we could be in very easy walking distance of the Temple and all the shops and restaurants around it.The gates and temple buildings themselves are very impressive, and dwarf you as you walk through them. Its always very busy BUT dont let that deter you - there is still that sense of peace that comes with the temple. The smell of incense is lovely, adding to the atmosphere. One fab thing is the shopping street through the gate and on the lead up to the temple - its fantastic for buying souvenirs, snacks etc. We bought most of our gifts from there - ranging from cheap and cheerful to real artist works. if you go at night its a lot quieter, but the temple buildings are lit up, and its a lovely atmosphere. Nice for a late evening stroll."

The other moment to go to Senso-ji is during the Coming of Age day, where a lot of ladies, who just reached the age of 20, will celebrate their first day as adult in traditional outfits. That was just beautiful !!!Like most of the other temples in Tokyo, you will soon forget that you are in the biggest megalopolis in the world."

Tokyo is great for many things, this contrasting peace and hustle lifestyle is definitely one of them! The temple is grand and beautiful and quite impressive in terms of other things around there. However, the real great thing about this place is the park area around it, no matter who you are or where you are from people welcome you as you walk by. This is great for just taking a day to recover from a long flight or late night and still saying you accomplished something that day. My friend and I were nursing a late night's yields and trying to really experience Tokyo in the one week we had. Yes we were on vacation and. No we were not worried if we missed things in Tokyo, but that was because we were on vacation, after a day, I already knew I was going to be returning :)One thing that I found great about this area was the small hostel and bustle market of random Japanese goods outside the peacefulness of the park."

With the surrounding shopping areas and restaurants this can sometimes feel like a tourist trap, but it feels very Japanese, which is a good thing when visiting Tokyo.

If you want to avoid crowds, then evening is fine and pretty quiet.I made my way here just before sunset, to give myself enough time to visit the temple and many of the smaller shrines surrounding it, many made to honor Kannon. Senso-Ji has it's own unique atmosphere and look, which makes it worth the trip. Of course, Hozomon should not be missed, since it is a symbol of Asakusa. The park area isn't as large as it looks on the map, since it is mostly concrete jungle.But as stated, the shrine is only part of the reason to come here. The vast number of shops and community which has grown around the shrine is amazing. Even as evening hits, there are a lot of restaurants, bars, and some shopping (there is a Don Quijote nearby). Just make sure to take some time walking around the perimeter of the park, to see everything the area has to offer.From here, it's pretty easy to get to Ueno Station, or down to Kayabacho and Tokyo Station. And of course, Tokyo Skytower can be seen rising in the distance, which makes this a perfect middle-stop in your adventure."

In between the walk you get a nice view of the Tokyo Skytree with some cherry blossom branches, though a better place to see it would be the waterfront a little walk away from the main entrance to the temple."

I recommend to visit it just before the end of the opening hours, then go down to the Information Center at the entrance, go up to the last floor to drink a coffee and look at the sunset over the illuminated temple from the sky deck.Then, go back to the temple and enjoy its lights at night."

The temple offering a great experience to be touch with Japanese traditional and culture.When you visit the temple in Japan, what you need to do is to clean your body with the holy water available in the temple area and then pray with the God and Goddess in the temple. On the way back, it is a believe that if you pulling the air with the smell of the incent in front of the temple in will bring you all the luck.In front of Sensoji temple is also the huge area shopping selling mostly Japanese sweet and dessert. You can also find some souvenir also but I suggest you not to buy it here as the price is tourist price which is about 15% higher than in the local market."

So I pretty much hustled from the subway station up to the temple, admired it, gave an offering, took some pictures, circled the temple and walked around some of the other buildings, and had to take off. It was definitely the most tourist-filled place I visited on my trip, but it's understandable and unavoidable. It was a beautiful architectural space and of a powerful scale to encounter first-hand. It would have been nice to relax and spend more time looking at all the buildings and green areas, so you could probably spend about an hour here. I didn't particularly love the shopping streets leading up to it, but I don't really care for shopping / cheap knick knacks, but if that's your thing, it's a good place to get it I guess. It seemed like there could have been some nice casual restaurants and cafes nearby though."

You put a small amount of money (100 yen, I think) into the box, shake the silver container, take out a stick with a number on it and open the small wooden drawer with the corresponding number to find out if you have good or bad luck. If it's bad luck, tie the small piece of paper onto the rail with the others to leave your bad luck behind. If it's good luck, take it with you! The shrine itself is impressive and colourful.

So be sure to cover both when you go,Getting there: take the Asakusa MRT (Ginza line) and walk along the crowded, but very local alleyways to get there. There is so much happening in the alleys that its worth spending some time to look around.How to explore: Start at the main gates, hire a guide if you can (but we found it very hard to find English speaking guides at the venues. You are better off reading about it early or using a tour operator). Then walk to the 2 main attractions and then the gardens on the left. Once you complete the gardens, continue walking till you exit. Outside, you will find more alleyways and eateries that are absolutely amazing!When to go: I would advise that you complete this early in the day, as most tourists then head off to the skytree right after (its a longish walk away). Even if you arent planning on seeing the sky tower or are afraid of heights, you should complete Asakusa in the morning (there isnt a night life scene anyway)."

The area surrounding the temple is a maze of stalls and arcades of restaurants and shops but as is almost always the case in Tokyo although they may be in a prime tourist area the businesses have fair prices and there is good food to be had if you wish to eat in the area. A number of stalls have specialty food such as ice cream served in cakes and curry buns that are well worth trying. At least a few hours are needed to do the temple and surrounds justice and it is well worth a visit. There is a huge contrast between here and districts like the Ginza and Shinjuku."

Noth of those also had plenty of visitors, but they were peaceful places and the visitors were respectful and the commercialism kept to tactful levels. My husband and I went to Sensoji on a Thursday afternoon and it was packed wall to wall with foreign tourists. To get to the Temple, which is gorgeous, don't get me wrong, you have to walk a 1/4 mile gauntlet of people and shop stands. It is loud, crowded and as far from peaceful or respectful as it could get without being actively destructive. I honestly think the city should limit the number of people allowed on the temple grounds at one time and close 80% of the shops. I would recommend Meiji over this spot 100 times over. If you just MUST see this temple, take a detour around the block and enter from the west by the Mitsumine Shrine. This peaceful park area lets you see the Shrine well while enjoying a pond full of colorful carp and many smaller shrines."

You will meet locals dressed in kimonos offering prayers at the temple. Apart from the main temple, there is a pagoda, a few other buildings, a garden with cherry blossom trees and a stream leading to a pond filled with vibrant coloured koi fishes. You will pass by Nakamise Street where there are shops selling local snacks, confectionery, crafts and souvenirs. The shops do not offer discounts therefore do compare prices. I visited the temple again at night, the shops may be closed but temple was beautifully lit up and there were less people around."

The large lanterns are particularly popular. The area around is also very nice for shopping and food. There are a lot of souvenir shops and we even saw a celebrity there. The one thing to caution about is the price of the souvenirs. They tend to be more expensive than ones found outside the area. The long street is filled with stalls and holds a lot of interesting food like ice cream sandwiches and fried mochi. The food is quite worth it. We also sat at a restaurant nearby in traditional style and ate udon. They do have a strict rule of eating. You're not supposed to walk while eating, and you must only eat in front of the store that you purchased from or eat at the side, but never in front of another store."

You then walk down The Nakamise, a shopping street of over 200 meters, which leads from the outer gate to the temple's second gate, the Hozomon. You are now at the shrine and you can witness the faithful performing their rituals which you can do along with them.

The temple is beautifully maintained and being able to see the monks perform their rituals is mesmerising. The gardens are beautiful, as are the other little pagodas and statues surrounding the temple. There are many stalls selling souvenirs, traditional Japanese goods and food. Do explore the side streets and get lost amongst all the wonderment. I ended up having fugu (poisonous blowfish) for lunch, which was delicious! And get in line for the crazy ice creams in traditional Japanese flavours such as matcha, black sesame & purple sweet potato. Many locals also like to come here dressed in traditional kimono/yakuta, which is very pleasant to see. Make a separate trip in at night. The crowds are far less (you almost have the place to yourself if you come around 8pm) and the lighting on the temple makes it look absolutely beautiful! None of the shops are open around this time though, if you're planning on buying anything."

The temple was very busy, but it was fun to see the hustle and bustle. Most of the tourists actually were Japanese, including tons of school kids, all having tons of fun getting their fortunes from traditional walls of fortune drawers. It was interesting to see the traditional purification rituals being done by most of the visitors, as well. Even my son enjoyed exploring the ground for an hour or so. We were really glad we visited. I will stop by again if I am in Tokyo."

Sure, it's mobbed by tourists, but this is one of those places where it adds to experience.The temple is free to visit, which is a boon. You start by entering the giant gates. They lead to the old shopping street, where you can many treats and tacky gifts. the treats are nice, but the souvenirs are pretty lame. At the end of the shopping road, you will find another set of gates. Enter, and you're in the temple area. Great place to spend an hour. More if you explore the area around the temple."

Leave via the North entrance of Asakusa station and you will be delivered onto the road that leads to the temple. This road is pedestrian only and full of shops for trinkets, Japanese traditional gods and food. Lots of food mainly sweet treats. One thing you must try is the Japanese sweet bread. Wow, that is something else!! A walk to the temple and a most amazing building awaits you. With lots of local devotees and tourists the mix is quite exhilarating. Make sure you have your camera with you. We spent over an hour just at the temple.Afterwards explore the surrounding streets of Asakusa. Hint. Plans your trip to coincide with morning tea so you can sample the sweets. Remember you cannot walk and eat at the same time as this is considered bad manners. Then, after the shrine find a little restaurant for an authentic japanese style lunch. There are literally hundreds of them in the surrounding streets."

In this case I went with my friends on a sunday so there was soooo much people. It was hard to walk and take pictures (which I love). But besides from that, the road to the temple is super cool, full of small shops to buy souvenirs or eat the most fun japanese street style food. I don't even know what I ate, I just said yes to my friends and opened my mouth haha. Everything was delicious! And the temple is beautiful, and there is the 5 stories kind of pagoda building, which I didn't see anywhere else. Also a lot of fortune papers to choose from!! hahaMost of all I liked the mood of Asakusa as a whole. Lots of things going on, tourists but also native people having fun, eating proper japanese, taking fortune serious, and just strolling down the streets <3"

We were shown by the locals the way to wash your hands and face before entering the temple. Once in the temple, we were able to light prayer candles and get our fortunes from a system where you shake a box until a stick comes out and then finding the corresponding drawer to your stick, which contains your fortune. We were lucky enough to both receive a good fortune! The temple itself was beautiful and ornate. A must see when in Tokyo."

An overwhelming smell of sweet treats is a great way to start the experience. It is crowded, obviously since it is a great tourist spot. The area has a lot of places to pray. It includes tons of small things to do where you donate a few yen, and can even get your fortune told. Surprisingly the fortune I chose has proven to be correct. Funny how things work out! There are tons of places to go even outside the area of the temple. So you'll be able to spend a lot of time here."

It's an interesting process where you have to shake a tin filled with think wooden sticks for as long as you feel is necessary to enhance your good fortune. Then you slide out one of the sticks from a little hole at the bottom of the tin. There are some Japanese characters at the top, which you can match to one of a set of drawers.

Tokyo's oldest temple is home to the spirits of Tokyo's ancestors so it's an important pilgrimage site for the Japanese people. The smoke of incense swirls about, adding a fragrant, mysterious aura to the atmosphere, as many locals drop by to pray on their way to work or school.Even though most of the temple buildings are relatively recent reconstructions since WWII, the craftsmanship in the architecture is so exquisite, you'd swear you were amongst lovingly maintained ancient structures.Sensoji is an absolute beehive of both reverential and touristic activities most hours of the day. But, if you show up soon after sunrise on a weekday, you'll practically have the temple grounds to yourself for an hour or so (please see my pics). I dropped by via the Tokyo metro after a dawn visit to the Tsukiji Fish Market since I was already up super-early!A breeze to get to ... simply pop out of Exit 1 at Asakusa station on the Tokyo Metro Ginza line. You'll then to walk up pedestrian Nakimise-dori on your way to Sensoji, a jam-packed shopping street with everything from the kitsch to the sacred, from the sweet to the savoury. Great fun."

Immediately in front of the temple was also a pit in which incense was burned. We watched as many people attempted to waft the smoke over them. We believe this provides good luck and fortune. A similar ritual was carried out in a water fountain on the right hand side on front of the temple. A must do as we did, is opting to pay 100yen to get a fortune reading. You do this by selecting a wooden stick with Japanese symbols out of a box and then you have to match it to the boxes in front where you will find your fortune. I was given with the \u2018best fortune\u2019, although my husband was unlucky enough to pull out a bad fortune. This is located on the top of the stairs on the right hand side. The temple itself does not provide you with much information on its history and so it is best to find this out yourself before you visit."

I had a plane to catch in six hours at Haneda International and decided to take the train to Asakusa first to see the Sensoji Temple. It is very easy to find because the Temple is the last stop on the Ginza Line, and once you get to street level it is literally fifty yards to your right when you exit the station.  The first thing that you see is Nakamise Dori, which is the shopping street. Be sure and try some fresh rice crackers or a small cake that is baked right there in a small cast iron \"griddle\". They are really delicious! This area will be packed with people making their way to the temple. It will be crowded, but that is part of the fun."

The Sensoji temple complex is quite beautiful and worth a visit not only for itself but also for the surrounding alleys full of stores, restaurants and bars. I also recommend going there is at least two different times. One during the day and another at night. During the day the place is extremely crowded and quite lively, but you can still see anything you want shop everywhere without too much hassle and grab lunch in one of the many restaurants around. Later at night after the little stalls and shops have closed, there will be much less people around but the temple remains quite beautiful to watch thanks to flood lights and in contrast to the day it's quite a relaxing atmosphere.I was staying in a hotel close by so I got to experience the dawn day dusk and night of the temple and I have to say that it's the most beautiful at night, though the temple itself will be closed."

The 'Senso-ji Temple' was founded in 628AD and is the oldest temple site in Tokyo and the capitals spiritual epicentre and as such it gets busy with visitors coming to pray as well as a far number of tourists looking for some culture, like me.The best way to get to the temple is to use the Tokyo Subway and take a train to Asakusa station. The main gate that leads up to the temple, ('Kaminari-mon Gate'), is just a matter of metres away from the station exit on Kaminarimon-Dori (Street). The gate itself (Thunder Gate) is interesting in itself and has a huge red paper lantern hanging inside it and it's flanked by two gods, Fujin and Raijin. Once through the gate you walk up Nakamise-Dori which is packed with stalls selling fascinating traditional goods and souvenirs. At the top of this street you will hit the huge 'Hozo-mon Gate' where on the walls of the gate facing the temple you will see two huge straw sandals symbolising the traditional footwear of Buddhist pilgrims. You will also see a giant bronze incense burner where you can witness the faithful burning incense sticks and wafting the smoke over themselves for good luck.In this area there are some outbuildings with little drawers in and you can select a draw, make a donation and the piece of paper in the drawer tells you your fortune... Great fun and I recommend you have a go. I don't believe in that kind of thing at all but never the less it was certainly a fun and a traditional thing to participate in.You then head up to the Temple's Main Hall with it's lavish interior and gold and lacquer altar. Look up at the ceiling with it's colourful dragon motif surrounded by angels and lotus flowers. This really is an awesome place with it's huge lanterns, bright decorations and large pillars that hold up the stunning roof structures. After leaving the Main Hall I headed to the Eastern area of the complex to see the deep red coloured 'Niten-mon Gate' built in 1618, and an important cultural treasure. Also in this area is the 'Asakusa Jinja' shrine built in 1649 and guarded by two lion-dog statues that honor two fishermen.Also worth a look is the 'Nade Jizo' a bronze bodhisattva statue which is said to relief aliments if you rub the part of the body that troubles you. Again a nice bit of superstitious fun! There is also plenty of other things to see, lanterns, an interesting bronze warrior statue cum drinking fountain with water coming out of dragon heads round its base, numerous shrines and two large Buddha statues made in 1687 to repay a debt of gratitude to a rice wholesaler family.It was pouring with rain the day I visited but even so I enjoyed it immensely and in short I highly recommend this excellent cultural attraction and the whole area in general with its traditional gift shops and restaurants."

There is a big hall at the center of the temple for worshipers and a 5-story Pagoda located on the west. It was second day of new year, the temple was throng by locals. I believe it was a new year festival. Locals came here for prayer and donation. Many also came for fortune seeking. There was many stalls selling local foods. I tried the Takoyaki, yummy and fresh. For me, this is a good place to experience traditional Japanese culture."

We visited with a tour group so we only had a very small amount of time and I'm a little disappointed that we never had time to go back and have a more in depth look. The temple is definitely a must-see, it's crowded but that just adds to the experience. Its a sight to look at and despite the bustle, as other travellers have said, it has a sort of relaxing ambience about it. There are little shops and touristy market stalls sprawling out from the temple, though as we were on a time crunch I didn't really get to have a good look at them.If you're only going to do one cultural or historical visit during your trip, this should probably be it."

The street leading to the temple is lined by touristy shops selling souvenirs - dolls, fans etc. It is quite pricey out there. The gate leading to the temple is quite imposing and have large lanterns. The temple itself is huge with a relaxing ambience.

But I will say that visiting this historic temple in Asakusa was an amazing experience. Senso-ji was one swinging temple! There is a long shopping mall crowded with pedestrians selling lots of souvenirs and many different wares such as shoes and even weapons. There is the main gate, Kaminarimon, along with other areas like the main hall and a small Shinto shrine nearby as well. It's very crowded by day and a bit more relaxed late in the evneing once all the vendors have closed shop. Once the crowds go away, you can feel the mystic charm lying all around this area. Even though some areas weren't brightly lit, I never felt in danger at all. This area isn't far from the riverfront, which is a walk down south. The pagoda here, when lit up at night, was mesmerizing! You can even breathe in the incense that burns in one of the pits near the main temple, which everyone seemed amused to be doing. If you love people watching, this place is for you. Always activity all around! There is no fee to just walk around and explore, unless you go to the altar for an offering."

I certainly found a variety of unique gifts (tenugui towels, carvings, prints). There also seems to be a variety of sweet snacks for sale (I found a great sweet bread loaf in a ice cream shop/bakery to the right just before the temple). The Temple and the Pagoda give one a real sense of Japanese culture and architecture. Do not miss this temple and the surrounding area. One could easily spend a half day in this part of Tokyo.

We passed under the torii, a traditional Japanese gate commonly found at the entrance of or within a Shinto shrine, where it symbolically marks the transition from the profane to the sacred. Then, we were able to perform Temizu using the hand washing basin. This involves taking the dipper in your right hand and scooping up water. Pour some onto your left hand, then transfer the dipper to your left hand and pour some onto your right hand. Transfer the dipper to your right hand again, cup your left palm, and pour water into it, from which you will take the water into your mouth (never drink directly from the dipper), silently swish it around in your mouth (do not drink), then quietly spit it out into your cupped left hand (not into the reservoir). Then, holding the handle of the dipper in both hands, turn it vertically so that the remaining water washes over the handle. Then replace it where you found it. We explored the grounds a little more and then walked around the Nakamise shopping street that is the front entrance to the Senso-ji Temple. We bought a couple souvenirs and tried some bean paste pastries."

            "review": "Traditions live on at Tokyo's oldest and most famous temple. Located in the traditionally working-class district of Asakusa district, Sensoji is Tokyo's oldest temple. There is a fascinating legend about how this 1400-year old temple came to be built on the site where a statue of Kwan Yin (Goddess of Mercy) was found by two fishermen. Real or not, in excess of 30 million local and international visitors come visiting each year. While its history and traditions are undeniable, part of the appeal probably also has to do with the Nakamise, the passage leading up to the temple that is lined with a fascinating range of shops. Coming off the main road, one passes under the Kaminarimon, a single tier gate that feature a pair of fierce protective guardians that dates back to the 13th century. At the end of Nakamise is a grander-looking second gate, the 10th-century Hozomon, which features two tiers. Once through this gate, the main temple of Sensoji comes into full view. This is is the newest section of the complex, having been rebuilt after World War 2. Admittedly, it isn't very large and with all the visitors that come daily, the temple and its forecourt can get quite crowded and especially so during festival time. But there's no sense of hassle and every visitor more or else finds his or her own pace. A good cross-section of society make up who comes here but there will often be tour groups and collections of schoolchildren, either in small groups or on a class excursion. If there's enough time, it's not a bad idea to check out some of the buildings the surround the main temple, including the 10th-century 5-storied pagoda, several prayer halls and also the Nitenmon or east gate, the latter often bypassed by most visitors."

Senso-ji precinct - tourist central!Amazing that in the midst of all the tourists and gawkers there are those here who actually come to honour the Kannon statue housed in the temple and to pray.The Main Hall of the temple is huge, the statues in the gates are huge, the lantern is huge, the crowds are huge - everything is super-sized.After strolling the neighborhood, walk up Nakamise Dori and gaze at the items for sale both, sacred and profane. When you finally arrive near the entrance to the Main Hall, join the crowds wafting the holy smoke over their hair and face, go to the basin to perform ablutions, toss a coin, and finally brave the crowds and enter. It is difficult for us to feel particularly holy here since one is always being jostled by others jockeying for a good position from which to see within. The big columns should be patted so that you can realize that this temple is a reconstruction, constructed not of wood but of concrete. We visit Senso-ji on each trip to Tokyo, and in recent years we have spent more time visiting the other halls and shrines in the temple precinct.Chingodo Shrine is worth a quick visit. Chingodo Hall is dedicated to tanuki (raccoon dog), said to be a guardian against burglars and fire. We read that this small shrine was built to appease the raccoon dogs who were living at Senso-ji. It is a small quiet shrine, worth a quick look. There are many tanuki statues, with gigantic testicles, wearing the tanuki hat, and holding sake flasks. Some signage is in English.We looked through the perimeter wall into the garden of Dempo-in, which we had read was closed to the public. A very kind woman visiting the Chingodo Shrine told us Dempo-in garden was open and there was an exhibition going on now and that we must go visit there. So we did. Dempo-in is open forin March to May. For 300\u00a5 entry, we saw the exhibition of temple treasures in the main hall. In addition, the gardens were open to visitors and tea was served. The paintings and artifacts exhibited were wonderful, all the more so since we knew that this very special place is rarely viewed.The garden is serene, lovely, and peaceful - a quiet place in the Senso-ji precinct. The pond and cherry trees were very photogenic. You can walk a circuit around the pond, cross a small bridge and wander under the sakura. Some say it is reminiscent of Katsura. The main hall was closed to the public, but from its interior tea was produced for all visitors. There is also a small tea house on the grounds. Unfortunately, though some may find it amusing, you can see Sky Tree from many spots in the garden, in addition to the Five Storey Pagoda. Seeing both together makes an interesting photo."

It's just a gorgeous view. The lanterns are lit up and when it is quiet you can almost feel like you're in another world ala Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away'. There are the denizens that come out at night and they are a sight to behold as well, but really, they're just nice to pass by as you take in the view of the temple.As for the vendors, also try the side streets for cheaper food and wares.

I would recommend going up to the information center across the street and going to the 8th floor viewing deck before visiting the temple. The shops between the first gate and second make for great souvenir shopping. Once at the second gate, you are able to see the masses of people preparing to enter as they cleansed themselves with water and burning incense before entering the temple. The inside of the temple is very beautiful, especially the painted ceiling."

I'm not a religious person, but the presence of other people praying did have a humbling effect on me.The temple is very clean and well looked after - I think this is one of the main tourist attractions in the area, and is worth going if you're religious, but otherwise you may just find it a bit so-so.There is an incense stand near the front as well if you feel like cleansing yourself.The location is right at the end of a promenade with tens of dozens of shops and stalls (where you could spend a little bit of time buying stuff), so you really can't miss it either.P.S. Don't forget to take change to put into the donation box at the entrance!!"

Senso-ji is Tokyo's oldest temple and an important center of worship. It is also known as the temple of the Asakusa Kannon. It attracts around 30 million visitors from all over the world every year. The legend was started by 2 fishermen who found a statue of Bodhisattva Kannon while fishing in the Sumida River back in 628.It was so crowded when we walked out of the Asakusa station. We did not realize that the date was the temple's most important and famous Sanja Matsuri festival in May every year. The surrounding roads were closed to traffic because of the festival. The festival is held in honor of the three men who established and founded Sens\u014d-ji: Hinokuma Hamanari, Hinokuma Takenari and Hajino Nakatomo. We were there on Sunday, and it was the last day of the festival. The 3 main mikoshi touring around the districts of Asakusa were fun and entertaining. We also saw the children mimic the adults with their mini version of mikoshi; it was so cute and a good way to pass the tradition to the new generations. Every mikoshi parade had a music float that played the traditional Japanese music of the festival. The musicians sat on the floats, and people pulled or pushed them. The heavy mikoshi was carried by around 40 men and women on four long poles secured together with ropes. We were lucky to have a close encounter one of the mikoshis while waiting outside a restaurant in an alley. It was my best opportunity to take good photos of the mikoshi.Before you can see the Main Hall of Sensoji Temple, you will pass the Kaminarimon Gate (Thunder gate). The gate is guarded by two gods, the Fujin (God of Wind) and Raijin (God of Thunder). You will not miss the large red lantern with black letter \u201c\u96f7\u9580\u201d (Thunder gate). After passing the gate, you will immediately find Nakamise-dori (Nakamise street) \u2013 a 180 m (590 ft) shopping street where you can find almost all of the Japanese souvenirs you would want. Of course, a variety of snacks is everywhere. Head down the street, and you will reach the 2nd gate \u2013 Hozomon (\u5b9d\u8535\u9580). On the left, you can easily spot the beautiful five-story pagoda (\u4e94\u91cd\u5854) and finally, the Main Hall of the Sensoji Temple. The Main Hall is always full of worshippers and visitors of different nationalities. The Main Hall was restored in 1958 because the original temple was destroyed during WWII. You may not be able to see the statue of the Bodhisattva Kannon because it is taken out for public viewing only on December 13 of every year. Don\u2019t forget to look up at the painting on the ceiling. You can also try to take the photos inside the main hall without flash, but it is challenging due to the multitude of tourists.The Asakusa Culture Tourist Information Center is another place you should go if you would like to have a bird-view of the Sensoji Temple. It is located opposite of the Kaminarimon Gate. Go to the roof, and you can have a fantastic view of the surroundings. The best way to get there is taking the subway and exiting at Asakusa station."

However, it is lit dramatically at night and was very interesting to see at this time and take photos. It's not for those who like quiet and understated temples - it's painted a rather garish combination of black, gold and red and draws crowds late into the evening but the sheer scale and statement of this place is very impressive."

When you come straightway from the main gate, you can see various shops on both sides: souvenir shops mostly, shoe shops, toys, snacks, kimonos and happy-coats, and everything. But you better visit the temple first and then enjoy looking at them. In September you may see chrysanthemums artificially designed and arranged inside the space between the gate and the temple. Then you see the smoke and smell frankincense at the centre; you can be healthy bywaving the smoke, only when you buy the incense sticks by yourself. In the temple, you may see a magnificent picture of a dragon on the ceiling. It grasps a crystal ball in its three fingers (as a demon it has only three fingers). Two cherubim are drawn on both sides of the dragon.If you have time, you may buy a set of postcards which include the traditional pictures drawn on wooden plates to be offered to the temple, or you can buy a fortune slip to pray good luck."

Early in the morning of March 18, 628, when the capital of Japan was Asuka (present-day Nara Prefecture), two fishermen, Hinokuma Hamanari and his brother Takenari, were fishing in the Sumida River. Suddenly sensing something, they pulled up their net to find a statue of Bodhisattva Kannon. When Haji no Nakatomo, village headman of Asakusa, heard about this, he immediately realized that the object was a statue of the important Buddhist deity Bodhisattva Kannon. Taking vows as a Buddhist priest and remaking his home into a temple, he spent the rest of his life in devotion to Bodhisattva Kannon. In 645, renowned Buddhist priest Shokai Shonin built Kannondo Hall upon visiting the Asakusa district during his travels. Following a revelation he received in a dream, Shokai decided that the image should be hidden from human view, and this tradition has remained in place ever since. Asakusa began as an obscure fishing village along an estuary of Tokyo Bay, part of the vast wilderness of the area known as Musashi. The district later thrived as people arrived in increasing numbers to worship. When Ennin (794-864), the highest-ranking priest of Enryaku-ji (head temple of the Tendai School of Buddhism) visited Senso-ji in the mid-ninth century, he created a statue identical to the hidden one that could be viewed and worshipped by the people. During the Kamakura period (1192-1333), the shoguns, who held the true power in Japan during this time, demonstrated great devotion to Senso-ji. Gradually, other historically prominent figures including military commanders and the literati came to follow their example. Enjoying the protection of these illustrious individuals, the temple buildings were refined. During the Edo period (1603-1867), first Edo shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu deemed Senso-ji the temple where prayers for the aspirations of the shogunate would be offered. As a result the buildings were imbued with still greater dignity, and the temple complex flourished as the center of Edo (present-day Tokyo) culture. Senso-ji is Tokyo's oldest temple. Known affectionately to people all over Japan as the temple of the Asakusa Kannon, it draws some 30 million visitors every year, remaining an important center of worship."

You can get a couple of nice shots here and in about 10 minutes will have completed your visit.If you enjoy hustle and bustle or want to go souvenir shopping then the temple is situated at the end of a shopping street. It is very crowded and you have to make space to move around the tiny shops. Prices seemed reasonable - not all shops charge the same for the same items though. Quite a few shops do take credit cards. If you need cash there is a seven- eleven near the subway entrance/exit."

Having stayed in a hotel nearby, I had the opportunity to see the place at different days of the week and times of the day. It's always very crowded, but the weekends are much worse. Close to the temple there is the Nakamise shopping street, where all kinds of souvenirs (cheaper than in other areas) and typical food can be found.

The temple grounds was extremely beautiful, featuring traditional gardens. The temple itself was very lively, there was a large crowd waiting to pray at the temple, although everything was very orderly (as expected of Japan).The main attraction for me however were the shops and eateries along the street leading to the temple. There is a huge selection of local goods, foods, and souvenirs. The prices were also very affordable. I bought a kimono from one of the shops and am very satisfied with the price and quality.Don't be afraid to skip lunch and come to the temple, you will eat more than you fill if you try out the eateries along the way to or back from the temple. All of the eateries featured something unique, and many of them offered snacks you can eat on the go, but please for the love of god don't litter."

This is the place to buy fresh rice crackers, manju and mochi. While we did see manju being made at other places, this was first time we saw how rice crackers are made, They sold hot crackers wrapped in nori. It was delicious and quite filling.

We have been here twice (different timings) and noticed that the crowd of worshippers never recede. An interesting part nearby is the large incense burner, a crowd puller. Many believe wafting the smoke towards oneself will bring very good luckThere is also a lovely pagoda and gardens and statues to wander around and admire. Walk down through the Denbo-in garden and on the left you will come upon lovely roads lined with traditional shops- this really feels like a walk back in time- a very different and historical part of Tokyo.

According to a legend, the statue was miraculously pulled out of the nearby Sumidagawa by 2 fishermen. Before reaching the temple, we had to pass a few gates. There is always a big lantern hanging at each gate. People were touching the lantern and taking photos. After the gates, we passed through Nakamise-dori, a shopping walkway where you can buy all sorts of souvenirs. At the end of Nakamise-dori, we spotted the 55m Five-storey pagoda and then we climbed up the stairs to Sensoji temple. There were lots of worshippers who were placing their josssticks into the large incense cauldron, after praying to Kannon. From the stais, we spotted Tokyo Skytree."

Even though there are crowds of people it is still a must see.When one is approaching the temple you first walk through a market place, (the shopping street has been here for several centuries!) a very interesting experience, as stalls sell everything Japanese; from snacks to souvenirs, and delicious ice-cream! A helpful tip; eating or drinking while walking down a street is considered rude. As is talking into a mobile (cell) phone while on a bus or train. The temple is architecturally interesting and beautiful, there are other buildings with in its vicinity that are also interesting, such as the pagoda. Beautifully clipped azaleas, lovely trees and small gardens add to the charm of this place."

The strip of shops between the Thunder Gate and the Temple was hectic, but the crowds moved pretty quickly.Something I did notice though, by my fellow travellers was something that made me very uncomfortable. When a young Japanese Girl and maybe her boyfriend are visiting the Temple and she, maybe even he, are wearing Yukata, for the love of all that is holy leave them alone. I witness some American ladies oohing and ahhing over one of the young ladies and asking then posing with the very uncomfortable looking girl. Yukata is not every day clothing, but it is clothing to them..not a photo opportunity (unless she speaks really good English. This girl did not and looked very confused by the attention)."

You should enter via the Kaminarimon gate which features a massive paper lantern. From there you are led down Nakamise Dori which is the street on the approach to the temple grounds where there are various stalls selling all sorts of different tasty snacks, I tried the green tea doughnuts which were surprisingly good! This is followed by the impressive Hozomon or \"Treasure House Gate\" which is the inner gate and has 2 large guardian statues. As you pass through don't forgot to check out the two huge straw sandals on the back face apparently weighing 900 lbs each! You then reach the actual Senso Ji temple which I have to say is probably not as imposing as the Hozomon gate or the 5 story pagoda that sits aside, but still very beautiful.

Ever wondered what it would be like to bump shoulders with the locals and try to push your way into the shops? Well, weekends make for quite the experience. People watching was very entertaining. Everything from Sumo wrestlers to Harajuku girls showed up. On week day nights it quiets way down. Shop owners are not as stressed and more able to help you with care and attention. The sun set beautiful on this site and makes for a more spiritual experience when you finally get through all the shopping and reach the temple. The Sensoji Temple is so beautiful and colorful. It's interesting to watch the locals throw smoke on themselves as a cleansing and go about their prayers. After watching the ritual a few times, I gave it a try. Culture is definitely alive in this spot. Whether you want to see it all hustle and bustle or in a more zen state."

The main entrance to this extensive Buddhist complex is through a large ornate arch from which a street of stalls and small shops selling a range of foods, trinkets and goods lead to the main grounds of the temple. This small shopping street of some 200 metres is part of the temple precinct and is said to have centuries of tradition of selling wares to pilgrims approaching the temple. Now, of course, they sell to the hundreds of tourists that throng the area.The main temples area includes a five-storey pagoda (reputedly the largest in Tokyo) an attractive ornamental arch and various small gardens and lanterns within a spacious forecourt (which also has good toilet facilities). The forecourt also had a number of trees with cherry blossom, which looked very fetching until closer inspection revealed that it was imitation (fabric) cherry blossom wired to branches that had been nailed to the main trunk! As it was cherry blossom time I doubt whether many noticed, but I did wonder whether they keep them there the whole year for effect?None of this is original, of course, as earthquakes have meant rebuilding several times over the years, including after the aerial bombing of World War Two, which destroyed most of it. However, it has been fittingly reconstructed and it affords a pleasant and interesting hour or so. This is well worth the visit, even if it is now packed with tourists and probably lacks the religious atmosphere, original structures and \u2018wow\u2019 factor of many other temples and shrines throughout Japan."

You never ever feel unsafe as you may do elsewhere in the world.

Tourists really should just chill out and go with the flow i.e. behave as the locals do - there is no stress here, other than that you might create yourself!!Senso-ji is a beautiful temple complex, even if it is a post-war reconstruction.

They have multiple layers of clock tower and pagoda. They also have a big board with something written in japanese. Just take your time walking around here and do not forget to take photo with sky tree as your background. You can see the tokyo sky tree clearly from here too. Tips: there are lots of souvenirs shop around sensoji temple. The price is cheap too compared to other attractions. Get them for your family and friends especially the ones made in japan. The souvenirs are nice!"

Good photo opportunities. There is an orange tree growing by one of the shrines which was just full of big and bright oranges... perhaps the healthiest orange tree I have ever seen!The main pedestrian only street leading to the main shrine has many snack and souvenir shops, but there are also cross streets with just as many things to see. One particular street had beautiful japanese lanterns ans street speakers playing some japanese string instrument which was so relaxing as you walk the street."

Our hotel was located by Shinagawa station, so we elected to take the river to get to the temple via a tour boat. It was a nice combination as we were able to see some of the city from a different vantage point. We basically followed the crowd to get to the shrine, passing through a parade as we went. It was lovely to see the costumes and people carrying statues and the like! Since we didn't have a guide, we had to rely on what we'd read. Upon entering the temple area, there is a big smoking incense pot which you are supposed to use your hands to cup the smoke and \"wash\" yourself with to prevent illness, harm, etc. Of course we took part in this :) Then there are the fortune sticks to do. There are several areas to put your coins in, grab a shaker, and shake out a fortune stick. (Just watch other people to get the gist of this when you get there). Your stick will have a corresponding symbol, which is printed on a draw. Open the draw and take out a piece of paper with your fortune, it is written in Japanese and English. Quite fun to do! When you've taken the appropriate picture of your fortune, tie it around the wire on the stand close by. (you'll see others doing this, so just follow along).On to the main temple, which was a mad house. We made our way inside and threw money, alongside hundreds of other folks. (this has to be big business!) We walked around the side to witness a baby being blessed, which was a nice bit of authenticity - this is an actual temple, after all.Walking back thru the maze of shops and people, we stopped to have a snack. We opted for chicken yakitori, which was pretty nasty - I don't recommend it. We had excellent food all over Japan, ACCEPT for the chicken. Chicken in Japan has a lot of fat, unlike the lean meat we are used to. The beef or pork was always a better option. If you like fatty chicken, go for it! It was an enjoyable walking afternoon, I'm glad we did it! :)"

Yes, it's touristy and goods are overpriced, but if you avoid the main street that leads to the temple, you will find side streets, hidden restaurants, theaters, even a small amusement park! The entire grounds are beautiful and I can get lost for hours discovering the different statues, ponds, bells, gates, etc. Don't forget to walk around the neighborhood! You'll find traditional,old school Tokyo just waiting for you. No crowds, no tourist traps, just pure peace and tranquility. If you want more tourism, walk to Skype Tree from the temple grounds, and/or go for a ride in a jinrikisha."

The Nakamise street is filled with vendors with street food and expensive souvenirs often crowded with tourists. This was my third time going there because it was part of the bus tour. However, I probably won't go there again. Vendors pretty much sell the same thing.They sell geisha, shogun, samurai dolls, silk kimonos, etc. they also allow you to take pictures, Every time a vendor makes a sale, they clap as these dolls are quite expensive. Most tourists just want to take pictures and not buy.If you're planning on buying food or souvenirs, don't buy them at the first shop you see at the entrance. They get cheaper as they get further into the street."

Go in the morning and watch and listen- you could be treated to a beautiful sunrise hitting the top of the pagoda, the smells of incense wafting, and the softly muttered prayers of the faithful.

It's easy to get to since it is in the middle of Asakusa, but I don't recall any clear signs pointing the way to the shrine (perhaps we missed the signs), so be sure to bring a good map or use your GPS. Either way, I still think it should not be too difficult to find, especially if you can find your way to Nakamise street.We arrived on a weekday afternoon and it was still quite crowded. Like other Shinto shrines, it was mostly focused on selling charms and taking money from folks, an aspect that I dislike especially since that seemed to be its main focus. There were plenty of places to buy the charms. The shrine itself is quite beautiful. There are many beautiful architectural elements to the shrine and it was the only one in Japan where I saw actual people going into the shrines to pray. But otherwise, it's a standard shrine.The shops that lined the streets just outside the shrine were a bit more interesting, especially on the Nakamise street. Plenty of food shops with Japanese sweets and other food vendors selling their concoctions are available, along with many souvenir stores."

Souvenirs sold here range from magnets to key chains, from Japanese dolls to handheld fans, from candies to senbei (baked Japanese rice crackers), and many many more! If that's not enough, there's Shin-Nakamise, a side street that cuts through Nakamise-dori, which has even more shops and restaurants!The main hall of Sensoji is glorious and, personally, I could feel tranquility in the main temple area although there were probably 500 people around me at that time. I recommend coming on a weekday morning to be able to enjoy the temple and its surroundings while it's quiet and serene.In Sensoji there are also the five storey Pagoda, Awashimado Hall, Yogodo Hall, Yakushido Hall, Bentendo, Chingodo, Nitenmon Gate and Komagatado Hall.If you want to experience a daily life in Edo, try riding one of the rickshaws usually found just outside of the temple grounds.

Asakusa is located in the eastern perimeter of the metropolis, therefore a little quieter but offering interesting shopping (especially traditional Japanese clothing, souvenirs, delicacies and cookware), theaters and amusements together with a glimpse of Tokyo\u2019s past (dating to the Edo period 1603-1867) and significant historical buildings. The principal feature of the area is the Asakusa Kannon Temple in Senso-ji, past the main Gate. The gate features a huge paper lantern which hangs in the middle and is flanked by the typical deities which protect the Buddha. The street leading to the temple ('Nakamise', 260 metres long) is a souvenir shoppers\u2019 paradise. The Asakusa Kannon Temple features a five storey pagoda, a familiar element in Buddhist sanctuaries and it is dedicated to \u201cKannon\u201d the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy. Although an ancient site (originally built ca. 628), the present buildings date to the 1950s but have been faithfully restored to the original. The roofs feature grey tiles rather than the imperial cypress bark. A characteristic feature of the temple is the heavily decorated gilded altar and what appears like a swastika symbol right at the centre, often encountered in ancient sites throughout the world. On the approach to the temple I followed the tradition and bought an \u201cOmikuji\u201d; a paper fortune obtained by putting in a token donation, shuffling the bamboo sticks in a can and turning the can upside down. The stick that drops contains a number which corresponds to a box that contains a particular paper fortune. On reading the paper fortune you may decide whether it is good or bad. If not good you may tie it up to a tree and let the wind blow away the bad fortune. I have kept mine; it was OK (sic!). The whole experience is representative of a nation that embraces superstition, albeit with humor and kindness. Another temple close by (\u201cAsakusajinja Shrine\u201d) is less grand in scale but equally ornate in typical Buddhist architectural style."

The temple is located right opposite the Asakusa metro station , which also has a well-staffed tourist information office. Entrance to the temple is through the Kaminarimon Gate (Thunder Gate) , which has large wooden statues of protective Buddhist deities. It is followed by the even larger Hozomon Gate to worship Nio, who is said to destroy the enemies of Buddhism. It has a huge two-tier roof, and is the main gate to the Main Hall, which is the earliest part of the temple complex. Of particular interest is a five-storey pagoda, with the fifth storey holding a bone relic of the Buddha, presented by Sri Lanka. There are numerous other gates and halls, big and small, as well as the Denboin \u2013 the residence and office of the Head Priest of Senso-ji Temple. Along the temple paths are huge shopping arcades, with everything from eatables and clothes to music CDs. It is also an opportunity to get to know the wonderful Japanese people. Right next to the temple is the Shinto Asakusa Shrine, which is a less elaborate structure, but is also worth a visit. Another attraction nearby is the small but beautiful Edo Shitamachi Traditional Crafts Museum, featuring authentic Japanese handicrafts. (Entry free)."

Having avidly read the guide book (Senso-Ji merited a double page spread) I was keen to see what all the excitment was about. We travelled out from central Tokyo and, as described, it was a very short walk from Asakusa metro station. The area was very crowded and when we reached the Kaminarimon gate it was absolutely crammed with sightseeers. The gate itself is very impressive and we proceeded through, we were at one end of a long arcade of small shops and stalls. These shops were selling a huge variety of souvenirs, from the tacky to the more tasteful. One of the better ones was selling Ukiyo-e woodblock prints,cards etc. The merchandise on sale here was lovely and good quality but the majority we just bypassed. They were crammed with tourists, mainly from cruise ships, seeing the major sites and shopping for souvenirs. We eventually managed to reach the temple itself, a series of pagodas and temple buildings with statues of the Buddha dotted around. Although there were still hoards of people, there was a different atmosphere inside the temple grounds. This is a place of worship and all around people were posting prayers, wafting smoke from the insence burners over themselves for good health and openly praying. Although not a Buddhist myself I was appreciated the atmosphere and found myself drawn to the religious rituals. Inside the main temple building, I was rather disappointed to find that, because I was not a regular worshipper there, I was unable to go into the inner part of the temple, I had to look through a screen. Outside again, we visited the little shrine dedicated to the fishermen who had found the statue to which the temple in dedicated and which is housed inside.Of course, I did the tourist bit, touching the well worn Buddha statue for luck, I am a spiritual person and find commercialised religious sites distasteful and disrespectful. I'm still not quite sure what I feel about Senso-Ji. On one hand there was the over-commercialised shopping street which is a definite part of the temple complex and on the other the spiritual religious site which was so obviously a part of so many Buddhists' lives. I would have appreciated the chance to at least observe more of the religious life of the shrine. It was very hot and humid the day I visited so I probably didn't explore outside as much as I could have. I still have mixed feelings, It is all very bright and fresh (a lot of it was rebuilt, having been destroyed during WW11) with the gaudy, tacky shops, but inside there was definite a sense of the spiritual. It was not my favourite temple in Japan but was still well worth the visit."

Conveniently located just minutes from Asakusa station, your arrival at Sensoji will be heralded by Kaminarimon Gate and its magnificently large, red lantern, flanked on its right by the god of wind and its left by the god of thunder. It was intended to make a bold statement and it does.Nakamise Dori is a wonderful lead in to the temple. While filled with trinkets and souvenirs (some cheap, others no so - for example chopsticks) there is an overall carnival atmosphere, which is always a welcome change after walking the concrete canyons that make up most of Tokyo.The temple itself is as bold and magnificent as the gate that precedes it. Off to the side is the Five-storied Pagoda, which I was unable to figure out the entrance to but which does exist if you know where to knock.A large majority fail to venture off the path to wander the grounds and gardens surrounding the temple. There are numerous, small shrines and Buddha statues and even a small Japanese-style garden with a running stream and stone bridge.A tourist trap it is not: It is an active temple visited by significantly more local Japanese (who worship there) than tourists. It is a dazzling sight with its bright red paint. The effect it gives off changes with the time of day and position of the sun. I happen to prefer it when it is gleaming the last remaining rays of late afternoon.As to the experience you can expect: Visit it during the afternoon on a weekend if you want a beehive of activity and enjoy the frenetic activity and energy that is prevalent. Visit it towards the end of the afternoon on a weekday if you want a more relaxed atmosphere with significantly less people. Overall, it is a sight not to be missed on a visit to Tokyo."

However, its a nice location to see some of the old of Japan. There are many rikshaws outside if you want a ride. But note, they will not pester you, hassle you or tout in anyway. As with all Japanese custom - everyone is respectful, humble and extremely friendly. They even helped me with directions without forcing me to go on a rikshaw. As you exit the station you can see the sky tree behind you. So if you want to use the \"special\" monorail to get it to it, you can add this to the itinary on this day. It is attached to a mall (so if you like the shopping this could be ideal).On the approach to the Shrine, there is a huge row of \"market\" stalls with souvenirs of sorts. These range from carvings, food, samurai swords, kitchen collectables, clothing and of the like. Its a wonderful vibe and it was hugely crowded. But this added only to the really nice atmosphere. Customer service as always was impeccable. There was no insistence by anyone to purchase. Lots of smiles and good vibes throughout the shops here. I must admit the pricing is no less than anywhere else. But you will definitely find something interesting and/or quirky to take back home. I purchased a few kitchen magnets and keyrings.The temple itself (on this day around 11) was also very busy but people are happily and respectfully praying, making blessings, taking pictures, meditating and moving along. There are lots of opportunities to take photographs of the beautiful architecture as well as elements inside the shrine from the incense pot to the various areas of prayer. Note you are not obliged nor are you asked to to contribute any money to \"make a wish\" or \"make a prayer\" but it was interesting insight to participate in the culture and I was happy to pay my respects.I would DEFINITELY put this shrine on your list to visit as its a beautiful place and really encompasses the heart of the old within the new. Note - it will be busy during tourist periods but its not a hindrance in any case. This is a place for everyone."

There arent regular tours, but you can probably get away with some info from the net over a tour which wouldnt go longer than an hour.

This is a must place when you visit this city, sort of like the Eiffel Tower in Paris or the Statue of Liberty in New York City. It rightly is an important landmark of one of the world's great cities. Dating back centuries, the temple compound and buildings are in remarkably good shape. This is amazing when you see thousands of people converging on the area daily. The high heat of August had no apparent effect on the number of visitors when we went.I like the way everyone is respectful of the place and what it stands for in Japanese culture. There is a deep sense of reverence, especially in front of the main temple building. Of course, you are invited to partake in the traditional Sensoji experience with the lucky wood shake and standing in front of the altar waving incense smoke to you. For me, however, a better experience was just walking quietly around the compound taking snapshots of various undisturbed objects and people. The photos in front of the big, red hanging ball is a prerequisite, but there is so much more to Sensoji just a few steps beyond it. Our hotel was within walking distance from Sensoji. We were delighted to pass through it about 20.00 hrs. one evening when everything was quiet and peaceful. We could take beautiful photos and enjoyed the serenity that was a far cry from the bustling crowds at midday.Sensoji is not just an old temple by the shopping mecca of Nakamise-dori, but an integral part of Japan and an experience not to be missed."

You can find very Japanese souvenir there, from traditional fan to littie budda, tea cups and HAPPI ( festival coat ), even cheap kimono. But make sure if it is made in Japan and proper kimono even for Japanese people, otherwise you may get disgusting cheap Chinese fake kimono with poor quality in vivid color.There are several foods shop which you can buy and eat while you enjoy walking. My recommendation is deep fried MANJYU, dumpling which ANKO ( Azuki bean paste ) inside. There are some variety of pastes, but the plain one is the best. You can also get NINGYO-yaki, lovely shaped little sponge cake. You can choose w/wo Azuki bean paste inside.The other interest of this temple is the food wagons. There are so many kinds of food wagons everyday that you can enjoy tipical Japanese wagon food anytime. Takoyaki and starch syrup lollipop with dried apricot, BBQ Squid etc. But they are expensive. Most Japanese people has memories of their childfood... had asked parents to buy one of these but never been bought because they are expensive. But worth to try, they are still Japanese people's most fevorite special festive foods.You can see people try to pour the incense smoke over themselves. It is said that if you get the smoke onto the parts of your body you suffered, it'll be healed. Most Japanese don't seriously believe it, but still they just do it for fun and bet. The other fun is a written fortune. Shake a box filled with sticks, and get only one to see its number. They are usually written in Japanese charactor, so you shall ask someone around you which number it is and what is written on it. Kind Japanese people will help you to get the paper from the little drawer and explain what it says in their poor English, but with pleasure. Although you get bad fortune, no need to dissapoint. Simply tie it on the board, you can find nearby, then bad luck will leave from you.They have special event every month on 18th, and some festivals. Especially in July and December, they have the biggest and most popular one. July 9\u301c10 is HOZUKI-Ichi, many stalls to sell Chinese lantern plant ( ground cherry; a husk tomato ) . December 17\u301c19 is HAGOITA-Ichi, also many stalls to sell decorated battledores. New year's eve and holiday are the greatest fair in the year.I always take guests from overseas to this temple and spend a day here. Everyone says this temple is certainly the best to go in Tokyo and Japan, and its memory unforgetable. Check their website and enjoy your trip!http://www.senso-ji.jp/about/index_e.html"

There are rumors that She may not even be on the property anymore.There are also fun fortune telling areas (you'll see lots of drawers).

It is a very popular attraction for locals and visitors and on any day it will be busy. The temple is also called the Asakusa Kannon Temple. There is something about it, maybe the crowds that gives it an aura of history, excitement and intrigue. If you are in the Shinjuku area, take the JR Chou line to Kando station and change for the Ginza line to Asakusa station. The temple is across the street. Best to walk the city street and then enter the temple from the side. This is the outer gate and leads right into the temple past the shops, which you can save for when you leave. This is the oldest temple in Tokyo. It is the oldest Buddhist temple also. It is very colorful with lanterns, bells and many building to visit. There is the main building and the Asakusa shrine, five story Pagoda, and to the left of the main building the building with Buddhas. All very informative, interesting and historic. Try your fortune buy making merit and pulling your lucky numbers out of the draws. On the grounds are numerous food outlets and beverage stands. When leaving walk the long walkway, called the Nakamise dori. Here there are hundreds of shops selling everything imaginable, all very crowded but always something to buy. This will lead you out thru the outer gate and the street."

As you walk away from the temple, and out of the market area and onto the main road, you will see a line of hand-pushed rickshaw carts (see picture). On the opposite side of this road is the Turkish place. Its like a small restaurant, with a window for take-away. Best kebabs ever!Sensoji is also a 20 minute walk from the famous Kitchen street (Kappabashi Dori). So one can do both the sights in one morning."

The temple shops selling the fortune telling and paintings are open early as well, so if you want to buy temple specific souvenirs while you are there, it can be done at that time too.- Don't forget to check out the ceilings - they have wonderful paintings as well.- the shopping strip in front of the temple opens around 9-10am.

There are other awesome food stuff to buy there, some being freshly made, like taiyaki (pancake like thing stuffed with red bean), dango and so on.Otherwise, unless you are pressed for time, I wouldn't suggest buying some of the touristy stuff, like the katanas and so on around there. they are a little pricey. - The next street parallel to the temple (or thereabouts) is a local wholesale area for restaurants and so on.

Both are a must see because they give one a perspective into the culture and practices of the Japanese people. There are 2 big places to see in Tokyo, the Sensoji Temple and the Meiji Shrine. This temple is located right in busy Asakusa. The entrance is lined by souvenir shops and Japanese snack shops and sweets in a street leading to the temple called Nakamise St. Great way to try all sorts of Japanese snacks.There is the usual Buddhist temple entrance with the big lantern at the center, and 2 statues to the sides(guarding the temple). The big lantern has some writings on it. As well as the fortune telling part( one chooses one's good or bad fortune based on chance), plus the writing of one's wishes on placards. All in all very much geared to tourists, very crowded, and noisy, but a must see unless one is visiting Nara or Kyoto, then the temples and shrines in Tokyo can be skipped."

The surrounding shrines and the small garden are also less crowded, and there is a sense of tranquillity. Sensoji is not an old temple like the ones in Kyoto, but it is very definitely a working temple rather than a monument, and that is what interested me most.Later in the day, it gets very crowded, and walking up Nakamise Street is a bit of a circus. There were a few interesting shops there, but most of them were too touristy. There are better shops in some of the nearby side streets. Don't let Nakamise Street put you off the temple, it is possible to get there via other streets."

With this trip being our 2nd trip to Tokyo (first in 2008), we knew that visiting the Sensoji Temple in Asakusa was a \"must\" since we liked it so much the first time. Very easy to find after exiting the Asakusa station - just follow the crowds through the wonderful vendor stalls. One of the favorite stalls sells soft serve ice cream cones in unusual flavors (at least to us) for 300 yen - flavors such as black sesame, rose hip, purple sweet potato, corn, etc. Another favorite vendor here is actually a regular shop in a stand alone building that sells Japanese Wood Block prints and paper products (postcards, cards, bookmarks, etc.) at what we think is a very good value. We stocked up on greeting cards this trip - prices ranging from 150 - 300 yen - very good prices for wonderful paper compared to greeting cards here in the USA. After our journey through the vendors, approached the beautiful temple and admired the awesome pagoda. In my experience, I always find it interesting how crowded the approaches to many of the temples/shrines can be, but once your get to the actual temples/shrines, the crowds thin out and everything calms down."

Definitely worth seeing, especially at the price. The Kaminarimon gate and the temples can offer very good photo opportunities, and now you can also get the Tokyo Sky Tree tower into the photos.However, it's best to visit during the week. On weekends, the tourists and locals combine to make for big crowds, especially in the shopping street between the gate and the temple, but also in the temple area itself. Do a weekday morning visit, and your visit will involve more temple and less crowding."

Then take a leisurely stroll for the several blocks leading up to the temple itself.The grounds are lovely - and certainly the main temple area is impressive, with some of the minor temples quiet and reflective even with crowds of worshippers and tourists just steps away.

There is also a spectacular centre to the temple, but we're not really sure what it was about.The traditional way to approach Asakusa was to take a river boat trip from Hama Rikyu gardens. It is not the prettiest ride in the world, but makes a change from the Metro.There is also a Shinto shrine on the west hand side and we were lucky enough to witness a traditional Japanese wedding there."

Each shop has a fake spray of cherry blossoms above your head to create the illusion of blooming cherry trees. The temple itself has a huge incense burner where devotees waft the incense toward themselves before they pray. The inner part of the shrine boasts a beautiful altar.

There is another large gateway followed by the main area of the temple and a 5 tiered pagoda tower. The temple and grounds are large and there are a lot of locals who use it for their daily religious needs who make the experience of visiting far more interesting. Lots of charm selling and fortune telling type things going on so one does get a real local feel to the place which is great.The temple does get a lot of tourists, but at 8am or 8pm you almost get the place to yourself and the temple is very photogenic in the evening.Certainly worth a visit."

Those who are more into shopping and food, will be able to lose themselves in the pedestrian mall leading to the temple (Nakamise street). Many stalls line both sides of the street, selling traditional Japanese items and souvenirs as well as Japanese snacks. It's such a treat weaving in and out of the different stalls. Great place to buy souvenirs as well. Surrounding the temple grounds are also restaurants and shops - good places to stop for lunch and do more shopping. Many locals go the temple dressed in their kimono best, so it's also a good place for people watching. A great all rounder. Give yourself at least a couple hours to wander around."

Firstly, before you get to the temple, the areas around it are filled with shops and other interesting things to see/do. I went a little overboard on buying souvenirs for friends there, but when you see what they have and the prices, you'll understand. The temple itself is the biggest I saw on my trip. It has amazing detail and the buildings around it are just as spectacular. As always, there are the large gates and its protectors at the front. The temple itself is very tall, with amazing, detailed art on the walls and roof. People give thanks and give offerings here like any temple, but in larger numbers.Next to the temple is a wonderful little garden area with great autumn trees and good side views of the temple.If you aren't big on temples, just go to Sensoji Temple, the Asakusa area is amazing anyway and this temple will make you want to see others!"

The temples is easy to get to on Tokyo's vast train system. I had something that I was particularly thankful for and wanted to offer up thanks at the temple. So, what one does is to go to one of the spots at the temple. There is a rectangular box here with a small hole on top. You shake the box in such a way that a long thin piece of wood that looks like a chopstick comes out through the hole. The stick has a number written on it in Japanese kanji. There is a bank of small drawers with coresponding numbers next to the can. Find the drawer with the number that matches the number on your stick. Open the drawer and take out a piece of paper from the drawer. On the piece of paper is what you need to consider or think about. There are many tourist momentos nearby as well as plentiful food stalls. Don't miss it in Tokyo."

We ate some sausage, yaki soba, and mini Hello Kitty and Doraemon shaped castuera (castella) cakes. It was interesting too, to wander around with the crowd and soak in the New Year's atmosphere since it was 1 January after all. I don't know what it is like at other points in time during the year but if you happen to be there on New Year's day, do drop in.

Leading up to the Temple is a lovely arcade of Japanese vendors selling all types of traditional foods, products as well as great souvenirs. The arcade or mall is very pretty with the upper part of the stalls decorated with fake flowers and other garlands. Prior to reaching the temple you can sample hand made rice crackers of all different flavors, shapes and sizes and see them being made, red bean paste waffles, sake served in an almond milk like hot liquid- (perfect on a cold winters day), chestnut ball skewers etc etc. Whilst very touristy, it is very pretty and atmospheric. Make sure you take time to peer down the back alleys as we were lucky enough to see two women in traditional dress standing outstanding a traditional restaurant- a perfect photo opportunity! The temple itself is very impressive with its huge imposing gates and enormous red lanterns. There is also a lovely pagoda and gardens and statues to wander around and admire. Take the time to walk down through the temple garden and head out to the left and you will stumble across other lovely roads lined with traditional shops- this really feels like a walk back in time- a very different and historical part of Tokyo that should not be missed. There are also strappingly fit rickshaw drivers who will cart you around the area for a price! In my view, this temple is one of the highlights of Tokyo and you could easily spend several hours here including having lunch at one of the many restaurants in the alleyways. We ate a great soba noodle place for about $10-$12."

But it is probably more accurate to refer to this as the Sensoji complex as there is more to see and do here than just visit the main temple (which is pretty impressive on its own). If you enter from the south side you get to walk through the massive Thunder gate and then you walk along the very clean but busy shops of Nakamise that sell both high end collectibles and low end souvenirs. There are also numerous food shops along the way, but they prohibit walking and eating here so if you buy a snack, they will tell you that you have eat it there before continuing on your way. Sensoji temple is massive, stunning and the huge number of rice barrels on either side indicate the temple\u2019s wealth. When you are done, make sure you exit to the right and cross the walk way to a smaller temple with very colorful designs. Then continue north towards the very clean public restrooms. Across from them in the landscaping are several stone statues, including one of Ultraman! Yes, Japanese pop culture is honored along with the traditional culture at Sensoji. Head back south from the rest rooms and take a quick left so that you are heading east to the Hikan Inari Shrine where you will see the fox gods that protect crops. Its small but unique. When you are done, head back west so that Sensoji temple is on your left. Go past it and then make a left so that you are working your way back south. This way you will see the Zenizuka Jizoson and some other smaller shrines. When you get back to the main pedestrian through fare, turn left and you will see the Nakamise shops up ahead. As you approach Nakamise, on your left will be the Chingodo Shrine, dedicated to the Japanese raccoon god Tanuki. Definitely worth 15 minutes. Cross Nakamise and keep heading east. You will see a handful of life size samurai statues on the buildings and a big Tanuki on your left. In a few blocks the pedestrian mall ends at a traffic street. If you make a right, you will be heading back to the Askausa metro stop."

If you are interested in photographing traditional-style religious buildings, then this is for you. If you do not mind having your approach to the site polluted by some 300 metres of stalls selling tourist tat and food, then this is definitely for you. The stalls are divided about 50:50 between the usual rubbish (dolls, sandals, toys, memorabilia) and food, mainly sweet-meats, mostly deep-fried. A few monks ply their trade in the area, so do NOT accept the proffered bit of gold coloured plastic and do not engage in conversation unless you wish to donate. The site is well placed some 10 minutes stroll from the river and the district (Taito-ku) is vibrant. A pleasant outing if you have plenty of time in Tokyo, but NOT a priority."

Arriving at the front entrance, the huge Kaminarimon Gate, with it's over sized stone temple guardians and immense red lantern is sure to impress. The Nakamise shopping arcade, which extends to the inner temple gate is sure to be packed with both Japanese and international visitors. It's a little like running a gauntlet of shoppers intent on picking up their 'must have' souvenirs, whether it's a porcelain 'happy cat', a brightly coloured yukata or fan, or a set of finely laquered chopsticks. It seemed very crowded to us, but our guide said that this was actually a reasonably low crowd day!Inside the main temple complex is a lovely 5 story pagoda that can be seen for quite some distance, several small shrines, and the main building, the Senso-ji Temple. We were told that it is the oldest and largest of the Buddhist temples in Tokyo, and the site of many festivals each year. Off to the right of the temple (looking from the inner gate) is the smaller but very lovely Asakusa Shinto Shrine, sitting behind a concrete torii gate. This temple complex is much more than a tourist attraction. It is visited daily by large numbers of the devout who come to pray. Unless you've become jaded by too many visits to temples and shrines already during your visit to Japan, you owe it to yourselves to see this impressive site."

Some people may not like this or find it too busy or intrusive, however for me this just added to the atmosphere of getting of the temple. Once in the main complex, despite it being busy, there is a feeling of calm and tranquility around. There are obviously many people who have come here for religious reasons and to watch people wafting the incense smoke over them, or washing their hands and faces is fascinating. There are numerous different buildings in the complex. Many people, we noticed, just headed to the main temple and then left, which was a shame as there is so much more to see. The Denbo-in garden was lovely to walk around as was the Niten-mon gate, so make sure you take some time to explore all the area!(n.b. if travelling from Asakusa station, first follow the exit signs to kaminarimon gate, then they change to senso-ji temple nearer the exit) once out of the station turn right at the top of the stairs, then left at the top of the road. The entrance to the market and then the temple is about 50m on the right)."

It's a great temple to visit, if you don't mind walking through a crowded lane (~1 km) filled with touristy shops selling almost anything. The temple in itself is very nice, and the huge bells with Japanese font on it looks cool. You can pay 50JPY to light a candle and 100JPY allows you to pick a numbered stick that tells you your fortune. Surrounding are is very commercial and has tall buildings around, which kind of disrupts the view of the temple in photos. Please make sure you do visit other temples and not just this one."

Very glad that I made the effort although I had my Japanese host drive me. Wonderful & colourful lane way leading to the temple with shops selling trinkets, food, japanese dolls, fans, rice crackers and just about every souvenir. Loved how I had to follow the etiquette on washing my hands before inhaling the incense to purify myself before walking up the step to the temple. Was not very crowded on a Fri early afternoon. I did have my fortune read, using a box with sticks, and numbers corresponding to little pigeon holes with the fortune in Japanese. The temple is dedicated to Kuan Yin, who I connect with. If I had more time I would have spent some time inside to meditate. Well worth a visit.."

We walked around the area for about an hour. The designated shopping streets are very commercial, with cheap touristy stuff for sale. I don't understand why this place gets such a high rating on tripadvisor.By comparison, we enjoyed our visit to Meiji Jingu a great deal. We were impressed by the simple elegance of the temple and shrine as well as the people watching. Perhaps if we had ventured out further to Kappabashi-dori we may have enjoyed the shopping there. As far as Sensoji and the immediately adjacent sites go, there was nothing memorable."

I thought the main attraction was the street leading to the temple - Nakamise Street with all it's little shops and stalls. You can shop till you drop. Little souvenirs are best found here. All in the one street. Reasonably priced too. Don't forget to try the large rice crackers (freshly made) and dipped in soy sauce, the little food stalls and even wasabi flavoured ice-cream.Good idea to do most of your money transactions in cash. I would not try using a credit card here. It is a must-see place in Tokyo. Easy to get to by Japan Rail as well. Enjoy the experience."

Coming into the temple compound, one can sense an aura of genuine respect accorded to it. We took our time to stroll through the temple compound, with it's handful of interest arras, before stepping into the main complex. Nice . Now be sure to keep your eyes peels for lovely and genial Japanese young ladies in kimonos . They are such a lovely sight. ... :)"

The temple and its pagodas were beautiful and vibrant in red color, smells of incense, sounds, and activity. Although most people milling about were tourists, there were some locals who had come to pray. We tried our luck at the fortune telling boxes (where you deposit a donation of 100 yen to have your fortune told). Budget enough time - about 1 hour - for visiting the street full of souveniers and unique Japanese paraphernalia, which is directly adjacent to the temple."

            "review": "Approach via Nakamise shopping street for an interesting contrast. Also known as Asakusa Temple, this is a large Buddhist temple in Tokyo dedicated to the bodhisattva, Kannon. Approaching from the Thunder Gate is a good way to visit because you will first walk down the Nakamise shopping street. Here you will find all manner of souvenirs and assorted kitsch as well as some food vendors. It's a flurry of consumerism and a very interesting place to observe people as it is quite a popular destination for both locals and tourists. I had a minor feast on some of the street food, which was quite good. I even got takoyaki, which is more of an Osaka-type treat than a Tokyo-type thing.And then, once at the temple, the tone is a bit more dignified. Visitors may \"bathe\" in holy smoke to purify or cure their ailments. And then they may pray to Kannon, who is associated with kindness. I'm told Kannon understands what is in your heart so there is no need to worry if you do not speak the language.This was a positive experience and the contrast between the holy place and the street leading up to it was quite interesting to observe. I'll say I did not feel quite as \"purified\" as I did when I visited Meiji Jingu Shrine. But that's probably because the setting at Sensoji Temple is much more urban. But it was a very neat place to visit and I recommend going there."

Part of the reason why is because its actually so touristy. When you come out of the station, they've built a marketplace that sells all the tourist goods you could want. It was also the first and only place in Japan that I had people soliciting me for donations and rickshaw rides. Even in Kyoto, people would wait for me to approach them. Just walk past and know that this is one of the only places in Japan like this.Down this market-street you can see Sensoji waiting for you. The huge red-lanterns that are icons of this temple are wonderful and the Pagoda is beautiful. The park is definitely worth a walk through as well.I would say Senso-ji isn't as expansive or impressive as some of the Kyoto temples (or even as impressive as nearby Shinsho-ji in Narita), but its the best one we found in Tokyo and the marketplace is an attraction in itself."

Many of the shops are filled with kitsch souvenirs, but still many of the shops are full of awesome little treasures and it's hard not to get caught up in the bustle and period setting. The temple itself is absolutely beautiful and serene, despite the chaos of the crowd located in the shops. And the FOOD. The food found throughout is absolutely amazing, I don't believe there was anything I tried that I didn't love, the fried manju being the best! I don't know the name of the vendor but it was on the left hand side towards the temple and they have 4 flavors: plain, green tea, sesame & plum, for a mere \u00a580 a piece!

You will see school kids out in force in their sailor uniforms, buying crackers and red bean paste sweets (I recommend the green tea ones!). You can also spot men and women in their suits stopping to pay their respects, bowing, ringing the bell, clapping their hands, throwing in contributions and then rushing off to the subway.This is easily the best place to shop for souvenirs. If you take a turn at any of the side streets that lead of the main street you are greeted with even more shops all small, packed together, with numerous restaurants in between. I always end up back tracking, as its easy to get lost in among all the twists and turns.

Once you are in the neighborhood, it is easy to find - just follow the tourists with their city maps, Japanese-English dictionary and cameras to probably the most famous temples in the whole of Japan. It is not far from the Asakusa metro stop. Between the outer and inner gates is a strip of shops and eatery stands that, from what my host said, has been around for centuries. The main temple opens up before you along with a very tall pagoda and the ensence burning pot where worshippers bring the smoke to their face. It was an interesting looking practice and since I'm a firm believer in the old axiom - \"When in Rome...\" - I gave it go myself, hoping I was not offending anyone. The temple itself is so gaudy, it is impressive. As much as I could with the throngs around me, I tried to lose myself in this old place and groove on what Buddhists get from it. The shops that line the way between the outer and inner gate are typical tourist shops - traditional Japanese snacks, fans with various Japanese symbols on it and local restaurants. I can't remember the name of the small hole in the wall on the back alley way that sold sushi and noodles. I normally chastise the \"typical\" tourist traps but this is one tourist traps that should be visited while in Tokyo."

If possible, see the temple in the early morning. An amazingly peaceful place in the morning mist as the sun rises. No stalls full of venders, no loud crowds. Just the statues, the running water, the clink of coins as the occasional dark-suited businessman on a bicycle stops by to pray on his way to work. After an hour or so about 50 or 60 school children will come though on a field trip, all in their matching uniforms. Since there are so many schools in Tokyo, apparently you can expect a group about every day. Not that it is a bad thing. Personally I prefer their cuteness and excitement over the packed crowds during the afternoons and evenings. Oh ok, indulge the tourist in you and see all the stalls full of T-shirts, key chains, and folding fans. One midday walkthrough was enough for me. Night is another great time to visit, after the venders have closed shop. You will have it almost all to yourself again. Except if you happen across a model photo shoot like I did. The only time the crowds are enjoyable is during the huge Sanja Matsuri; a festival held every May. It is a must see if you are in Tokyo at that time. All of Asakusa is alive with chanting and drums as golden shrines are marched though the streets."
