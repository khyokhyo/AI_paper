This plush museum quarter was created following the completion of the National Rijksmuseum in 1885 and is located on the south side of Amsterdam.It's considered the cultural hub of the city and home to the two other major museums- the Van Gogh Museum (1973) & Stedelijk or City Museum of Modern Art (1895/2012) as well as the Neoclassical Royal Concertgebouw from 1888 w/ 650 concerts p/year.Other prominent buildings along the square incl. the fortified U.S. Consulate General, the House of Bols w/ its Dutch gin museum/tasting room, the Diamond Museum and Coster Diamonds where you can buy the quality stones.The square was reconstructed in 1999 to incl. an underground parking area & supermarket. The spacious outdoor grass area is often used to stage large events such as festivals, celebrations, music concerts, demonstrations and even a polo match.In the winter, part of the area is transformed into a cosy artificial ice skating rink for kids.Finally, the place is also surrounded by numerous hotels, restaurants and cafe's as well as exclusive clothing stores & boutiques!"

So I did on this trip. The size of the crowd surrounding the sign was a surprise. You can see from my pics, it was impossible to get really any kind of a shot of the whole sign."

Look at Leidseplein, Frederiksplein, Rembrandtplein (huh are those squares?), even Dam Square. In the end they all get used and filled with statues, commercial stuff, or even new buildings, like it happens to the last example in this row: Stadionplein. Museumplein is relative open space, with beautiful view on the four large art temples here: Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh, Stedelijk and Concertgebouw. Although, the view from Rijksmuseum downward is spoilt by the ugly letters 'Iamsterdam', that attract thousands to make stupid souvenir pictures. On the side of the square there is a row of tourist kiosks and in winter large part of it is covered with a kitschy ice rink. But the grass is nice and the atmosphere friendly."

This pubic square includes a large reflection pool, the iconic 'I amsterdam' sign, near to the Rijks, an area of souvenir and food stands and plenty of open green space for those seeking to get off the city streets. During our recent visit in late March, the trees remained bare of leaves, leaving Museumplein much less attractive compared to warmer months of the year. This reduces the appeal of spending time here at this time of year. However, we still enjoyed having a quick bite to eat at the foodcrib stand at Museumplein and being outside for a bit in between museum visits. Tip: For museum goers, there is a Museum Shop near the I amsterdam sign that is jointly operated by the Rijks and Van Gogh Museums. Here you can buy entry tickets to both and skip the very long queues that form at both when attempting to buy tickets at the museums' main ticket sells counters."

The museum also has a sizeable collection of Rembrandt's work. Note that this museum has the same architect as the Central Train Station of Amsterdam. Next in line is the ever popular Van Gogh Museum where one can always expect a long queue for entry just because it has the biggest collection of the finest works of the painter including the Sunflower, The Yellow House , Irises, his self portraits etc etc. Then there is the Stedelijk Museum that specializes in modern arts collections.

Most people just pass through on their way from Rijks to VG etc. There is another I Amsterdam sign, and if you are inclined you can watch people trying to take selfies...or making themselves look stupid in the process. There are a few open air cafes and snack bars. At night the area is lit, making it look more attractive than during the day. I've rated it VG simply because of access to other attractions. I'd not go unless you were planning to visit one or more of the museums."

The size though, is incredible, lot's of green.Is it easy to access, yes, Trams drive there from various directions, so it is really easy to go there. Anyway you have to cross the square when you walk from Stedelijk Museum or Concertgebouw to Rijksmuseum or vice versa. The real attraction are the \"I Amsterdam\" letters in front of the Rijksmuseum. Everybody is climbing them and taking pictures, so it seems to be a sort of an attraction.Important to see? I don't think so but it is anyway there while you are at one of the Museums."

However it turned neither \u201cup close\u201d nor \u201cpersonal\u201d! The reason for this was that there so many tourists around, in and on top of the various letters of the sign, all posing for photographs, that it was almost impossible to get anywhere near the sign. It certainly was not possible to take a photograph of your companion next to the sign, without some \u201crandom\u201d appearing in it.Eventually we gave up and headed off for a bit of a rest, sitting on the grass well away from the sign.

Make sure to check out in advance what\u2019s happening in the Museumplein area, as we stumbled across the Homeless World Cup. Sadly we had no idea what it was, but later learned it was a social movement which uses football to inspire homeless people to change their own lives. It would have been cool to catch a game or event. You can also take some nice pictures around the I amsterdam sign. Go early or late to help avoid all the strangers in your pictures."

It's a perfect place to just take a break from the museums, grab some space and relax. There were people all around us with picnic baskets and right behind the Rijks Museum on Museumplein is the big IAmsterdam sign with people climbing all over it - great for pictures. If you're walking from the grass toward the Rijks, head down into the garden on your right and stand in the middle of the water fountain where you can remain completely dry while the water goes up and down all around you.Our 16-year-old daughter just loved laying down on the grass and relaxing with all the others.What a beautiful place."

Of all the public spaces in Amsterdam I find Museumplein to be the most peaceful (when you avoid the busy spots). I enjoy watching the skateboarders on the half pipe. It also has the best Albert Heijn supermarket with a sushi bar and of course three of the biggest and best museums. Pre-book for those before you go to avoid the stupidly long queues."

So go here to relax and appreciate the museums and structures anyhow they come together. If you want a photo of the sign, the one at the airport is less crowded. There are a few free wifi options as well"

The busiest period is about 10-2PM but this place does not feel too crowded because the space is large, with high ceilings. When we went back at 4PM, after a mental break, museum seemed empty but it was also closing at 5PM. We also checked out 1700-1800 period which had some interesting maps and a few good replicas of ships."

Within a few blocks you could see amazing Rembrandt paintings, three Vermeer paintings, a whole museum of Van Gough paintings, and a compact modern art museum with a very good Matisse special exhibit on two floors. Public transportation takes you to two different ends of the area. Make sure you buy a transportation pass so you can freely travel in the central zone, but going to the airport or the flower market requires a ticket to a farther zone that cost us an extra 5 Euros each way. Arranging entry times to museums on the internet will often save you a lot of time in lines--especially for the Van Gough Museum. Buying the museum card will likely save you money. Even the Ann Frank House is on the museum pass (it is not in the Museumplein area), but reserve a timed-entry way in advance because the line for general admission on the museum pass can be long."

But our lovely B&B in the Jordaan district let us drop off our bags and then suggested Museumplein to fill the day. We walked there (same district)...a long walk but so scenic along the canals lined with 16th century row houses. The Riiksmuseum, the biiggest of all in the area, is a gorgeous, gigantic. building, a work of art itself. We killed a couple hours in the pleasant coffee shop overlooking the ticket counter, watching the ticket line grow from nothing to quite long, so buy your tickets first if you arrive early. Our mistake! Rembrant\"s Nightwatch is the signature piece and so impressive, but there is so much more to see. The Delftware exhibits are amazing. There are several museums in Museumplein including the popular Van Gogh Museum plus a huge lovely park. ( It helped that we had lovely weather for the long walk back as well.)"

Quite a few benches if you want yo rest your feet for a minute. Also a museum gift shop that does not require you to pay to enter the actual museums."

It's a very tranquil area - am assuming residential? - judging by the very few cars (and even fewer bikes) passing by. A few benches scattered here and there, a few food kiosks but the real attractions re the museums: unlike other museums I have visited, Stedelijk, Van Gogh's, and Rijksmuseum (the last being my personal favourite) are very well organized and make for an organized and well informed visit: the exhibitions are organized chronologically, and besides work from the main artist (no matter who that might be) , you get the chance to watch his contemporaries, rival, friends', mentors' work as well. These museums provide a lot of context and backdrop for you, the visitor, to better understand art. Besides, you can walk through Museumplein with a zoot in your mouth and nobody will bother you."

Using tram is very recommended, and its about 10 minutes to/from Amsterdam Centraal station. If you getting tired from tour walking inside the museum, you could take a few minutes to relax in Museumplein park, and drink or eat some snacks that you could buy from Albert Heijn the supermarket besides the Stedelijkmuseum."

This is where you will also find the IAMSTERDAM sign which is a great photo op"

This one is the easier to visit from Amsterdam centrum; 2) Like the name says, it is the area which concentrate 3 major museums: Rijksmuseum(the most valued Dutch museum), Van Gogh Museum (the best and most complete museum from the famous Dutch artist) and Stedelijk Museum (The main modern art Dutch museum).

Usualy you need to stand in line for that cause people like to pose next to it in million variations. Getting back to the topic - On a sunny day it is nice to sit there and sun bath. On a snowy day, you can skate on the water like a real Dutchy. Either way, worth a visit. Later you can wait for about 2 hours to get to the Van Gogh Museum...Good luck!"

When we decided to stay in the Museum Plein district, our first thought was the museums themselves - as we just love the stimulation of the great creative talents across the ages. BUT THAT'S A BIG MISTAKE. We stayed on a quiet tree lined mini square off Jacob Obrechtsstraat and Vanhultstraat with a charmiing Saturday market. We realised that we were not only in the middle of the museums but a short walk to Speigelstraat, Leidsestraat/Leidseplein/ the charming Kerk Straat and as close as one really requires to the Pijp restaurant/nighlife district. Of course the beautiful Vondelpark was a skip and a jump away. We easily walked to the \"NIne Streets\" where we bought the most delicious chocolate at Pompadour great bakery and cheese shop as well as the very creative \"frozen fountain\" where we bought the most unique umbrella we have ever come across.The plein itself is a grassed space that you must visit on the weekend to experience local families and footballers letting their hair down. (By the way we have stayed on the canals themselves but our choice is still the \" M\" Plein."

The rest is a big lawn. Many tourists hang out here, but also many locals, largely for playing soccer or other sports.

However, by 10am there were SO many people here that it was pretty much impossible. There was no common courtesy or respect for those waiting - everyone was just pushing and shoving and walking in front of people to get what they wanted. Had we more time in Amsterdam we would have left and come back a different time of day. The grass field was full of picnicers - and a great location. All the public sculptures add to the area, and the large fountain/pond in the middle is beautiful and adds. Great place to take a \"break\". However, in the summer, the crowds of tourist from 10 - 4 at least, are unavoidable."

Be advised that this place is usually very busy with people getting their pictures in and people playing sports on the endless green grassy fields, or dining in one of the cafes. With so much in one place you must be prepared for it to be busy. We went immediately over after checking into the Hotel and found ourselves in a sea of people crawling all over the I AMSTERDAM sign getting pictures. I will admit it was tough with our 8 year old but allowed her to play a little as we got into the mix of picture taking with all the other tourists. There is a playground there and a huge water reflecting pool, although not much reflecting with all the dogs splashing around. A great little secret- go early in the morning here and there is nobody on the sign, much less in the whole entire area. We went early the next morning after our initial trip and had the entire sign to ourselves with another pair taking pics. They were polite,as we were, and shared the picture opportunities that just don't exist later in the day. Imagine only 6 people at the sign taking pictures...a great area to be in at all times of the day depending on what your looking for."

            "review": "Nice place to hang out in the summer - next to all the museums. This large \"plein\" is obviously called Museumplein because it is basically a large \"square\" that is located opposite the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum. It is a large outdoor space, with cafes, outdoor souvenir shops, friet stands, another general museum souvenir shop in case you missed something in the museums you had just been to, or perhaps just wanted to buy a souvenir without the \"trouble\" of actually visiting a museum. In the summertime the square is a very busy place, with impromptu performances, and a little bit of everything else. Mostly famous now because of the enormous AMSTERDAM sign. You can't miss it if you are in the area, but it is certainly nothing worth going out of your way for on its' own merit."
