            "review": "A subtle but spectacular hidden gem. Some of the attractions of the Cape Point Nature Reserve are visually stunning but some are more subtle, requiring a little more time to appreciate. Dias Beach provides a visual feast, as does the view from the Point itself. It isn't the actual southernmost tip of Africa, nor is it the meeting of two oceans, but it should be! It's a spectacularly dramatic meeting point, particularly in slightly stormy weather, of two mighty ocean currents, and to view the roiling ocean from the lofty viewpoint above is unforgettable. There is a good restaurant at the base of the funicular which provides a superb view across the bay. Just be careful of the baboons stealing your lunch if you decide to have a packed lunch outside.Take time to drive down as many of the side roads as you find time for, particularly Buffels Baai and Olifanstsbos. There are many beautiful and secluded beaches, some with designated picnic spots, where one can braai. Again, beware of those crafty baboons, who will stare soulfully out at the ocean whilst timing their raiding sorties on your picnic!There are truly wonderful hikes, where one can see all manner of bird life, an explosion of flowering fynbos in Spring, plus an assortment of antelope. One of the extraordinary things one can experience is to look up from one's beach picnic, to see ostriches pecking away amidst the kelp!I have yet to do so, but one can also stay overnight or longer in one of the SANPark self-catering cottages."

Spectacular especially from the lighthouse at the top. If you are fit take a walk up otherwise a very good funicular to take you up. Also on the way out visit the most South westerly point of Africa were you will more than likely have baboons trying to get at any food you have in the car ( take care) and may see ostriches wandering around on the seashore.

There were many tracks and look outs to explore which gives you different angles of the landscape which included the lighthouse and Cape of Good Hope and many of the surrounding mountains and oceans. The gondular was a nice touch as a method of getting to the top but another short walk of some 50 steps or so steps are required to get to the lighthouse. Get there a little early if you want to do the Cape of Good Hope walk as that takes 1.5 hours, and the other short tracks can have you walking around for at least an hour ( and more time if you head into the shop)"

Spectacular. And this is often sold as the southernmost tip of Africa, where the Indian and Atlantic oceans meet. It is neither, but far more spectacular than the true southernmost point Cape Agulhas.- try a few smaller roads to get down to the sea The cons- pretty boring vegetation. Fynbos. Sanparks rangers get terribly excited by fynbos, and probably have wet dreams about it, but in truth it is not very exciting and if you drive from Cape Town in any direction you will see hundreds of kilometres of various types of fynbos. Now all sing, to the tune of \"I joined the Navy to see the world\"...\"I went to Cape Town to see the (insert appropriate word) , but all that we saw, we saw the fynbos\"- very few birds. Really, you struggle to find any- animals. Now here's the thing. Dont get confused by the name Nature Reserve and dont have any illusions about there being ANY animals, let alone any exciting African animals. I have been to Cape Point many many times. On the best, the absolute best, animal spotting occasions, and excluding the baboons at Cape Point which are pesky AND dangerous (do not under any circumstances try to picnic) I think I have seen about 10, including maybe 3 ostriches and 6 or 7 buck or zebra. When I visit, I visit to see Cape Point which as I said is spectacular and sometimes take side roads to get to quieter more scenic spots, for the rest I just drive straight through."

On the way there we saw baboons and ostriches which were a pleasant surprise."

We even saw some seals playing in the surf. It took us a little under 2 hours to fully take the walk then saw ostriches and baboons on the drive out.

There are various small towns on the way which seem like beautiful places to stop and look around (if you go Friday, stop at Bay Harbour Market on the way back or Saturday on the way to the Cape). At our arrival to the Nature Reserve, there was a long car queue of vehicles looking to enter the reserve. It took us around 45 minutes of waiting. After paying the fee, we followed the line of cars to the cape point car park. From there it's a ten minute walk past hordes of tourists to the light house and another twenty minutes to the actual Cape Point. There are also others places in the park where to take scenic stops. If you're doing the garden route and you're looking for a bit of a hike and nature, I recommend Robberg Nature Reserve compared to this!Conclusion: the various small towns between Cape Town and Cape Point look a lot more intriguing than Cape Point itself."

The flora was in full bloom too - enormous bushes of blossoming pincushions & other indigenous flowers. Needed a whole day there, but it was still an afternoon well spent."

It really is one of the most panoramic drives I've taken over the years. So, if possible, hire or take your own car...its worth it. There is a restaurant with point and sea views. There is a mini cable car that takes you up the mountain to cape point. However, I recommend walking. Indeed one walks \"up\" to Cape point and not down but walk allows better views and of course that \"wind in your experience\".The advertisements list mountain zebra and baboons. I saw only baboons. Beware of baboons they are not to be trifled with.In short, if it is untrammelled sea and mountain views you seek, then cape point is the destination without a doubt.On a side note. The wind is stronger down there and colder. So take a jacket if you are prone to the \"coldies \"."

Please note: one has to pay to get into the reserve, then pay to take the lift which drops visitors off roughtly halfway to the top. Good walking shoes are a must. If the climb up to the lighthouse is too much, there are intermediate lookout spots on the side which offer a splendid view. I saw visitors with binoculars, which I thought was a good idea, to spot marine birds whirling about and to try perhaps to see the whales which frequent the oceans in the area. At the lighthouse, one is looking over two oceans and the view is breathtaking. Or maybe that was me trying to catch my breath... In any case, not to be missed. On the way to the Cape of Good Hope, our party spotted three ostriches and a couple of springboks near the beach."

You don't have to climb right up. One of the most beautiful views the Cape offers. As a Tourist Guide - I can definitely recommend a visit - its just about one of the places you have to see!

They are dangerous and aggressive and are looking for food so if you are carrying bags there is a change they will try to get them off you.

The scenery was stunning the whole way down. Im glad we got to Cape Point early as all the tourist buses started showing up which slightly tainted the serenity of it all, but was still beautiful. We drove back to Cape Town via the west coast which was amazing!! A definite must."

There is also some whimsy with the story of the sleeping giant dooming the flying dutchman to sail his waters forever taking shape in the form of a funicular ride to the light house. You can spend hours on end just watching the waves crash against the rocks on Cape of Good Hope. The walk up to the the different view points is spectacular. Be ready for sharp winds and glorious photos :) There are various tour companies that take you on a trip to the reserve, or you can rent a car and drive from Cape Town (about 1 hr with not stops). You can also take the train Metroplus upto simons town and then rent bikes to the reserve. We took an uber from Cape town to the reserve and back. About 700 rand one way including all stops. We stopped at Hout Bay, drove through Chapman's Peak drive, via Kommetjie and return via Simons Town and the penguin colony. I highly recommend this method of travel to all those not comfortable driving by themselves on strange roads. It is convenient, can be personalized and cheaper alternative to tour buses. If we had the time I would have done the train/bike option."

Best advice I can give is to drive there yourself, don't plan to go with a huge group or a tour. Sure, go on the hike up to the lighthouse and follow the crowds for a bit, but the beauty of this park is found elsewhere. It is a treasure of natural space and a photographer's dream. Go down to Diaz Beach! The steps are daunting, but so worth it. Drive out to both the east seaside where you can spend time by the beaches and rock pools, and go to the west side where you can hike around and enjoy incredible views up and down the coast. A special treat on the west side is the low clouds and fog rolling up the mountain during much of the year. Take a lunch, and plenty of water! Neither are available in the park unless you want to go to the pricey restaurant and shoppe. Plan a whole day. The entry tickets are about R110 last time I checked, which is a lot of money locally. Use common sense and don't go off the trails, pick flowers, collect anything, or feed wildlife!!!"

But going there look carefully around the road inside the national park, you might spot ostriches, baboons, turtles, snakes, and huge antelopes.

Where else on Earth can you stand and watch the merging of two huge oceans. Wildlife is a rarity, except for the many TROOPS OF BABOONS that roam this sanctuary freely. Bontebok, Ostrich, and Bird life are also to be found, but difficult to spot. The Da Gama cross also stands proudly within the reserve, this has a history all of its own. Great fishing spots abound along the shoreline and the beach at the Cape of Good Hope is a MUST visit. The rugged coastline on the Indian Ocean side of the reserve is dotted with beaches that are not crowded and ideal to enjoy because the water is warmer than on the Atlantic Ocean side of the Reserve. Rock pools and Tidal pools also abound the coastline. Enjoy, you can't go much further South without getting your feet wet."

Part of the trip was a visit to the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Point, part of Table Mountain National Park. The Cape of Good Hope is somewhat touristy with people falling over themselves to be photographed by the sign. This may be the most southwesterly point on the continent but it is not the most southerly and does not mark the meeting of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans so I can't understand the fuss. Cape Point is a little further east and is not so gimmicky. There is a funicular railway to the top or you can walk up. At the top there is the obligatory signpost with distances to Paris, Sydney and New York but it is otherwise fairly unspoilt. There is plenty of wildlife including baboons and ostriches in the park. There is a very good restaurant at the car park for Cape Point. The sea views are excellent."

The baboons are fun to watch but you cannot interact with them as they have been known to be aggressive and attack people and cars, so please respect the signs that ask you not to feed them or interact with them and lock your cars.There is a popular misconception that Cape Point (and the Cape of Good Hope where it is located) is the southern tip of Africa. It is not - that is Cape Agulhas about 150km to the east-southeast. That should not stop you from having your photo taken at the sign which says 'Cape of Good Hope - the most south-western point of the African Continent.'"

As you enter the nature reserve there are wild apes and their young along the road. It is truly beautiful. The drive to the actual point is beautiful and unexpectedly flat. You do need an entire day and its best to go early as there are a few hiking trails which offer amazing views. My favourite was the 5 minute walk to the tip. Definitely worth the trip and my favourite part of Cape Town."

The road winds down to the funicular railway up to the old lighthouse, where we were able to take some awesome photographs and see some amazing views. We also walked part of the way to the new lighthouse, which provided the opportunity to view some interesting seabirds. Finally, we drove back inland a short way before turning down to the Cape of Good Hope proper, which has a good plaque for selfies, and lots of ostriches.

If you have small children or if you have mobility issues then the cable car/train is the best way to go. For the walkers, the climb is pretty steep however there are places to sit and rest along the way. The view at the top from the light house is spectacular. We took some great photos.

There were fewer tourists, and the weather was nice and cool.The only frustrating moment during our visit was fighting with 100 other tourists who all wanted their picture in front of the \"Cape of good hope\" sign. If one of those mega tour buses had arrived, this would have been a nonstop battle and we never would have had a moment to ourselves (and the sign). A great stop if you're down that way... Not a must see, but it was a great flash back to world history, remembering how Magellan and Diaz and others came that way once upon and time."

The day cost $800 R per person and was we'll worth it. Jimmy our guide was full of information and even spotted a whale for us."

Cape Point Nature Reserve has many hiking paths and outlook points other than the most popular lighthouse spot, and we are so glad that we took a local's advice to check out some of these less touristy spots. That being said, we did really enjoy the lighthouse at the point as well, but hiking down the trail to the very tip was probably our favorite part of our stop at the point. If you love nature and hiking, this spot is for you. But, do beware of the baboons. They are definitely not afraid of people!"

Cape Point particularly gets overwhelmed with bus loads to pic snapping tourists especially on weekends, and it can seriously degrade your experience. Take your time on the side roads and you could get lucky and see some of the animals in their natural state."

On the left from the parking lot there is an entrance to the beach and there is plenty of them there. And they let you get very close.There are a few locations at Cape Point. If want to hike one day will not be enough. 2 locations are a must see - the Cape Point itself and the lighthouse on top of the mountain. We took a cable car to get up and then walked down. The views are spectacular. There is a very nice restaurant right by the cable car station. Get a table on the deck and watch out for monkeys."

On the way, you can admire beutiful Diaz beach and you can also opt for climbing the stairs down and back up (great exercise:-)) and enjoy the beach. When we were there (late afternoon in January), we had the beach to ourselves!!The path to the Cape of Good Hope is fairly easy, only at the end, you have to climb a little - but the ocean views are definitely worth it."

But beware of baboons who will steal your lunch if you aren't careful and sit on your picnic blanket eating it! But don't let that stop you taking the side roads off the main drag leading you to Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope as you'll find some wild and windy corners worth visiting. "

That particular staff ( the manager on duty that day ) was ridiculous to the point of ruining a perfectly good day. Summary ! if you don't accept dogs advertise it.

Cape Point is a \"must see\" in any travellers list. For a start, there is a wonderful coastal journey (try to sit on the right leaving Cape Town) . It is quite a long journey, but can and should be combined with a return leg via the Indian Ocean side and some of the attractions there. You could easily see wildlife, will certainly view some rugged, almost brutal, coastline waters and will definitely enjoy memorable and unique scenery. Try the funicular, visit the lighthouse (a few more steps involved) and maybe walk back down a good and scenic track before eating or rejoining your transport. However, if you want the photographic experience...avoid the rain!"

There is a convenient cable car to the top or you can walk and enjoy the views even more."

Watch it! though - They are quick and greedy and strong and seem to like windscreen wipers. The fynbos stretches over the rocks, the sun glints off the sea and we are in a different world. The complex round the lighthouse has a lot of parking - tip the parking guards a few Rand - but avoid busy weekends when the rest of South Africa wants to visit.

The main visitor center is terrific to learn about the history connected with this area and walk on the trails to the lighthouse, etc. There is a smaller visitor center closer to the entrance, which is often less crowded.

There is a small entry fee to enter and a long drive through the reserve to reach the point.We ate when we arrived at the restaurant (great views) before heading up to the lighthouse to take a few snaps. Be warned the winds are strong enough to blow away small children and annoying wives. The baboons are great to see wandering around and aren't shy of people - just don't feed them and you'll be fine. There's little vehicular train which can take you to the top of the point if you are tired of waking up steps.Definitely worth a day of your time and even more if you plan exploring the beached and the cape of good hope.

The view from the lighthouse show just how powerful the oceans are, tremendous waves breaking onto rugged rocks and how the lighthouse was so important. There is a restaurant there but we only wanted a snack so gave it a miss. On exiting the park we had to hand in the copy of the form we had completed on entry, this is to ensure no one is lost in the park at night as it's such a huge place and there in not much mobile signal so if you have broken down etc they know that you haven't left the park and can go looking for you.

It's also less crowded than the funicular with just as good scenery. Try to allow the whole day if you can. We stop to view the Penguins at Boulders, just past Simonstown on the way in."

The restaurant at the Point was excellent- the best, most imaginative salad I have ever eaten! There is a cable car up to the lighthouse at the top of the point- otherwise it is a very steep path. There are plenty of clean toilets and the obligatory gift shops. Don't stick to the main paths as you drive through the reserve- there are some beautiful bays off the main road, with sort walks and information boards."

Without knowing, we suspected that it would be a view over a lot of water from the Cape Point, and more to experience by the Cape of Good Hope. Dias' Beach is a powerful experience, with heavy waves thundering in. We saw antelopes, ostriches and other animals both wild and farmed). The views from the pathways are also spectacular. I had to \"lean inwards\", having a notable high anxiety, but it was not too bad. Most of the way is smooth to slightly rough, but the last part is fairly rough and demands walking in more-or-less natural stairs, with quite high steps. No problems for a normally fit, but not recommendable for those with walking problems."

You can walk up to the lighthouse. It's a steep climb, well-paved, with steps along the way. If you have any mobility issues, take the funicular instead. Of course, you get a chance to stop and take photos if you're walking; you'll want to get photos along the way up. Some in out group stopped at the curio shop below the lighthouse; others walked the entire path to the lighthouse. There is a restroom at the curio shops at the base of the mountain and mid-way up. I noticed a few benches along the way, nice to catch a breath. It can be quite windy so layer up accordingly. Also, this isn't the place for cutesy sandals and heels; those ladies looked quite uncomfortable. There is parking and, I think, room for buses. A magnificent view awaits!"

Pros: - it looks like a VERY beautiful place to go when its sunny. even with the mist it was very beautiful in its own way - they just had painted the lighthouse which was cool to check out! - we did the trail to the point and we could watch the boats out in the ocean. some great places to see the lifts - if you get a chance make sure you check out Dias beach! Cons: - watch out for the end of the day around 6:30 pm when the baboons come out to eat trash. its fun to watch them initially but if you are a woman they will come and smack you backpack !"

The Cape of Good Hope is marked by a signpost in both Afrikaans and English with latitude and longitude, at beach level. There is parking and it is very exposed with very windy conditions at times, very much a camera opportunity. Cape Point is reached by a funicular and is at a high level with great views around the area. There is a souvenir shop plus the Two Oceans Restaurant as well as parking around the base of the funicular. Well worth a visit in good weather."

First time we were the 3rd vehicle in line, this time we went in the afternoon and waited in a queue of traffic to go and and down made worse by stop / go road works. However, while stationary we saw baboons (keep your windows shut!) and ostrich. It's a wonderfully scenic drive, no photo could do it justice. If you can get here early, keep going and get to the top before the crowds, you can then take your time on the way down and appreciate the views and the fynbos. The day we went the funicular wasn't working, those who couldn't walk up could pay to go in a minibus. If you are fit enough do make the effort and climb up to the top of the lighthouse; the views are stunning and look out for the rock hyrax (dassie)."

It's a long trip to the point, probably further than we realised and the traffic leading into the nature reserve was horrendous, we queued for almost 2 hours to get into the park itself, although once in everything was fine. We had a whole day so we had plenty of time and also planned to stop off en route to see the penguins at Boulders Bay. Unfortunately after driving all the way there, the Reserve had a power cut and the Funicular was not working so I didn't make it to the very top. My husband and son did take the walk up but that's not for the unfit like me and I would have struggled in the heat. By the time they had gone to the top and come back down again there was a huge sea fog that came in and people after us would not have been able to see anything of the views.It is worth taking the longer route via Chapman's Peak and Boulders Bay. It is truly spectacular scenery and I am so pleased we came into the Reserve that way. We then found an alternative way back which was not as stunning but still worth it."

The funicular to the lighthouse was not operating one the day we were there, but there was a shuttle bus running up and down on a regular basis. There are nice views from the lighthouse. You can also hike down to the new lighthouse which is closer to the Point, but we opted not to do that in the interest of time.Off to the side of the parking lot, near the rest rooms, there is a trailhead for the trail that leads to the Cape of Good Hope. One can also drive there, but this is a worthwhile hike with fabulous views, if you are fit and have sturdy shoes. We hiked to the look-out point above the Cape of Good Hope parking lot, about a 1-1/2 hour round trip. The trail continues down to the parking lot but it is a steep hike back up to return. There is no protection from the sun on this trail, so a hat and sunscreen are necessary.Get to Cape Point early as there was a fairly long line of vehicles waiting to get in as we were leaving."

The park forms the tip of the Cape peninsula with beautiful ocean and mountain views.Through the gate and the vast majority of people hurtle down the central road to the two famous capes, The Cape of Good Hope, the south west tip of Africa for the essential photograph and Cape Point overrun with tourists but with all the facilities including a restaurant with the most fabulous views. From the car park, you can take the expensive funicular up to the old lighthouse and from there admire or even walk down to the new lighthouse. The views are stunning. Some may take the scenic walk between Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope.However following the tourist trail will ensure you miss out on the real beauty of this amazing park. There are four places worth visiting, two on the False Bay side of the peninsula and two on the Atlantic side. On the False Bay side there is Buffels Bay, a beautiful picnic area right on the sea complete with toilets, tidal pool and braai facilities making it popular with South Africans. North of this is Bordjiesrif, another spot right by the sea with tidal pool, picnic areas and loos. However to get right off the beaten track take the left hand turn to Black Rocks and follow the road down past the limestone kiln to the parking area. From there you can walk along the tarmac road to Venus Pool a most unusual coastal feature overshadowed by three enormous peaks. On the other side of the peninsula where the Atlantic waves roll onto the rocky shoreline are two more hidden gems. It is a fairly long drive down to Olifantsbos where there is parking overlooking a beautiful beach and you will almost certainly see bontebok and maybe baboon and ostrich. The baboons here are noted for their seafood diet of shellfish and kelp. From the car park there is a beach walk to the wrecks of the Tommy Tucker and the Nolloth. People will be in very short supply.Another great place is Platboom. The car park is on a low bluff overlooking a wide sand river. After crossing the sand, you can either turn left for a deserted beach walk or turn right and find the coastal path. After an unpromising start, the path wends its way along by the rocky shoreline and there is great variety of birds to be spotted hopping on the rocks including terns, cormorants, sacred ibis, herons and plovers. It is a stunning walk and you will almost certainly see not a soul. In the distance the traffic hammers to the Capes but you walk in splendid isolation. One memorable afternoon, not only did we see the usual array of birds but also bontebok with young, ostriches with young, baboons always with young, Cape seals basking on the rocks and as we turned to return to the car I glanced over my shoulder to see a herd of eland crossing the dunes.The best way to visit Cape Point is to take a car, take a picnic, take your binoculars and take your time. Away from the crowds you will not be disappointed."

Pack your hiking shoes (don't forget to bring enough water) and go for one of the scenic hikes there.

Besides the incredible raw beauty of the rocks + beaches that form one of the most southern most points of South Africa (it is NOT the southern most point please note!), and the breathtaking view from the Lighthouse, there are also stunning and relatively flat/easy hikes and walks to be taken in the nature reserve. Look out for baboons, ostriches, Bontebok, and delicate flowers. From the entry, the roads are well signposted, and you will be given a map on arrival. Drive ALL the side-roads, stop, get out and look at the Diaz crosses, and breath the amazing air. Once you get to the 'touristy' part where you either climb to the Lighthouse or take the Funicular if you're not that fit, don't forget your camera to photograph some of the most breathtaking views in the world. If the wind is blowing, hold on to your everything! Stop at the Restaurant for a meal or coffee, and just know that you're privileged to view one of the most amazing places on earth!

You stand there and see this meeting of forces - go up to the lighthouse and think about the incredible history of all the ships from Europe passing here to go to the far east, months and months at sea ...... but on top of this, the park is a breathtaking area where Fynbos (one of the 6 floral kingdoms) is abundant and is there without the so often found influence of alien vegetation. Once you get off the beaten tracks, you find pristine beaches, landmarks - and you might bump into some exciting wild life. It's such an inspiring place, so full of vibrant life - be it in nature or history. I love it."

This is not correct as the most southerly spot is along the coast at Cape Aghulas where also the Indian and Atlantic Oceans also meet.However, this should not dissuade u from visiting Cape Point, it is a good drive out from Cape Town which also allows you to enjoy the coastline and towns along the way Muizenberg, Kalk Bay, Simonstown. When you arrive at the entrance and pay the entrance fee you will be surprised that Cape Point is still a good 11Kms from there.Once you arrive at Cape Point you have two choices about how you reach the top - you can walk (it is a good walk up) or use the Funicular (unfortunately this was not working on the day we visited). This was a challenge for us as my 80 year old mother was unable to walk up to the top. Once you are up the top the views are fantastic - looking down at the sea, the Cape of Good Hope and indeed if you walk further around the point the little light house at the end of the point.If you are feeling energetic and adventurous and have enough time you can walk from Cape Point to the Cape of Good Hope and back. It is a good walk and takes about 90 minutes for the round trip. Be prepared for strong winds which even on a very hot day will make you feel a little cold!Thee are shops to purchase goods and also a food shop and restaurant which is very popular and busy with great views along the coast."

Be careful if you swim, this is treacherous water if you don't know what you are doing, rather swim in the tidal pool. If you want to go to the tourist centre at the top it is also worth a walk out to the 'tip of Africa' (which obviously it isn't ) but it feels like it! Not cheap to get in but well worth it.

Glad we did as by the time we got to the point, the clouds had moved on. Views were spectacular!We took the funicular to the top as we were in a bit of a time crunch and wanted to see the lighthouse. We may as well have hiked (which we did on the way down) as the funicular decided not to work and an engineer had to walk down from the top to fix it. Make sure you drive down to the point proper and get in line to stand by the sign. You wouldn't want to miss proving to your friends that you stood in the most southwestern point in Africa.

My youngest daughter was over the moon to experience the height at the light house and to see those points showing how many kilometres it takes to travel by ship to other countries like Rio de Janeiro,London, U.S. etc. One thing I didn't like though is the fact that we pay at the entrance gate and again pay for the cable cars to the light house it is costly! But otherwise the experience was awesome, we even took some walking trips just to view the beauty of nature.There's also a huge rock at the light house were people can write their signatures as a sign that they were there,it's like leaving your footprints so that those who come after you may witness your presence!"

We had a leisurely drive to the southern-most point, climbed the path to spectacular views (in spite of a howling gale-force southeasterly wind!). We then drowve to see one of the \"padraos\" - large crosses to the memory of Vasco da Gama and Batholomew Diaz - and on to another pristine beach. Along the way we were treated to visitations from a troop of baboons. It was a most enjoyable outing!"

However, as the people who built the lighthouse realised, Cape Point has its own micro-climate. I am sure the views are amazing but often they are hidden by the cloud. In a strange way the cloud and rain gave the space atmosphere, but I can't help thinking it would have been better on a sunny day. And, to be clear, it could be a beautiful day in Cape Town and for most of the drive down, that doesn't mean anything."

So here's the thing; this is a good place to visit, however, it is not worth the 45 minute trek uphill to reach the light house. Once you reach there, you will have to opportunity to take a picture for a memory at the bottom of the hill, where the latitude and longitude of Cape Point are mentioned. For those who wish to stop here, may do so willingly! For those who wish to go to the top of the hill near the light house, you have two options, either take a mini tram uphill which will cost you around ZAR 50 one way, or you may choose to test your hiking skills. If you are hiking, you will find 4-5 spots which are picturesque for a photo stop. You will find many such places (some even more beautiful) in the Garden Route. So if you wish not to climb it, I suggest, take a photo at the bottom of the hill and head towards Cape of Good Hope."

After the usual photo's it the top there is only one way and that's down, also it's a good idea to wear a hat of the sun.Be careful when near the baboons. They are not pets and can not be played with or touched. They can be aggressive. Please don't feed them. Half way down is nice tourist and souvenir shop, at the bottom near the car park is reasonable catering and clean toilets.

We thought we were going to have to wait forever, but it only took about 15 minutes to get in to the park. After park entrance, you drive another 10 minutes or so to get to parking for Cape Point. There is an incline car to take visitors to the top of the mountain for a fee, but we chose to walk up, stopping along the way at certain points to take photos. The walk up was a bit challenging, so make sure you have proper footwear, as well as sunscreen if you're there on a sunny, hot day! We were also there during the \"table mountain cloud,\" so once we got to the top, the visibility was very poor, as you are IN THE CLOUDS :) We were initially very disappointed, but if you just wait a few minutes- we did about 15 minutes - the clouds pass and you'll the incredible views. You can walk to the top and see views from the lighthouse, but we really recommend doing the lighthouse keepers walk to get to the southern most point- those are the most incredible views.

Just over an hour's drive south of Cape Town via one of the most scenic (Chapman's peak) drives in the world, Cape Point is nothing short of spectacular. Come at the right time of year (July - November) & see whales in the bay & the views across the ocean are just superb! All in all, a great day out which you can combine with the penguins at Boulders just north of Simon's town."

Cape Town has so many beautiful places to visit but Cape Point was definitely a must see!We arrived as soon as the Nature Reserve opened as to avoid traffic. The line can get pretty backed up entering the park. We started off with grabbing a bite to eat at the restaurant on site. Luckily, we didn't have a long wait but was told its common. Its a hefty walk to get to the actual point of the two oceans so pace yourself! The walk is full of beautiful views of mountains and the ocean; absolutely gorgeous! We casually strolled the whole way and ended up spending half the day there when it was all said and done. I'd definitely suggest consulting with the weather before going. Also, be on the lookout for baboons! We saw a bunch when leaving the park."

This is supposedly because there is so much wind that the vegetation cannot grow. There is a fence around the park because there are a lot of animals like ostrich, zebra etc in the park. Unfortunately on the day we came, we couldn't see any animals at all.  We arrived at 11.30am and the way to enter the park was amazingly long! Traffic was bumper to bumper. One has to enter the park to get into the Cape of Good Hope. They say the queue is only during this time of the year at the height of the tourist season. We were very disappointed because at the end of the queue we realized that there was no electricity in the park and we couldn't have lunch even though we had the reservation and the funicular was not working. Some of the views in the park were amazing. The reason is because of the different blueness of the ocean. Also there are these distant mountains with the clouds on the mountains. Natural views like these are priceless."

So after being dropped off and dropping off our bags to be portered ( well worth the expense) we set out on the well marked trail. We had made arrangements to stay in the cabins well before. Lovely views and well maintained trail the entire way. Lots of elevation. Some confusion when we got to the cabins as it seemed the place was a bit deserted. Abandoned buildings concerned us but we did find the right place after wandering around a bit. And our bags were there. 3 separately locked rooms, bathroom, bunkroom. Wed dropped our packs and set out for the point. The trail on the map was not so easy to find and was quite rugged but we made it. Opted to take the funicular to the top and then walked to Diaz point, beautiful. At this point we had hiked over 14 miles and maybe 3k feet of elevation gain so we thought walking down the road might be best. Which it was and a lot shorter it seemed. By luck we were met by the people who maintain the huts who were just checking up on us. They showed us how to operate the hot water which was lovely to shower in. We braiied up some meat and had a very sound sleep. Next day the trail took us by the ocean which was gorgeous. Lots of elevation in the last kilometer so be prepared. Finally done, picked up our bags which were waiting and were on our way. All in all an outstanding trek."

I made two trips, once in a cab and the other Self-driving. Self-driving is highly RECOMMENDED. For one, car rentals are cheaper in CapeTown. One can get a car in R800 for the day, cabs costs 1100R upwards.Coming to CapePoint: The drive can take you via multiple routes and so can the return. The Best route is to go via the drive over Muzinberg, onto Simon's Town (stopover at Boulder Beach for the Penguins) and then onto CapePoint. Return should be via the other side of the Cape, and DEFINITELY via Chapman's Peak into CapeTown. We crossed Chapman's peak when the clouds had set in and its wonderful (the drive has a small toll - 40R). When Entering the Cape Point Park: The first stop can be the Cape of Good Hope. Its nothing spectacular, just the signage that you are at the Southern-Westernest Point in Africa. The real deal is Capepoint, 10 minutes ahead. Capepoint has 3 main things to do: (a) The light house on top (b) The Trail going being the light house onto the tip of the point and (c) another trail going down the greenish beach type area. Unfortunately on both my trips, I could not do (c), as it got late. I would plan to go early and be at cape point max by 11 AM and spend the entire day. If you have a car, there are so many nice \"small roads\" leadning upto virgin beaches once you are inside the park (Park fee is 125R, per head btw). I strongly recommend (a) Self Driving (b) Spending a good 4-5 hours and (c) Returning via Chapman's Peak. And a decent GPS navigator and co-driver :-) Enjoy the ride !!"

Once in the park we made our way to the main visitor's centre car park where we then headed off on the Cape of Good Hope trail. We spent the better part of the morning on this trail and looped back to the visitor's centre and lighthouse via the overnight hut trail. Quite a climb but so worth it for the views (take lots of water and wear hiking boots as this trail is quite technical). After the hike we took the funicular up to the lighthouse and explored the top of the hill - this is a great activity for all ages. Finally the heat won and we made our way down to Dias Beach for the afternoon. This secluded beach was fantastic, and we were the only one's there - the stairs deterring most from taking advantage of this natural beauty. We enjoyed watching a seal swim along the waves before heading back to the car. A very pleasant day out in natural beauty that I would recommend to all visiting the Cape."

The primary attraction is the Cape itself, which involves driving through the park to the southern end and then taking a funicular railway for about 10 minutes - and then there is a walk uphill to the viewpoint. Alternatively if you want to walk out to the lighthouse, which is lower down, you take a different path but I never found out which one. Make sure you investigate this thoroughly before you start. There are plenty of side roads in the park which take you through areas of vegetation and some of them go down to the sea. You have good chances of seeing antelope and ostriches, and we saw an elephant seal at Oliphants Bay. It should have been in the Falkland Islands, we think. So don't expect to see one - although it's not the first time one has been seen there."

There is a steep walk up the cliff to the main viewpoint area, so wear comfortable shoes. There is an electric cart for taking people up the mountain, but the walk is part of the adventure. Prepare to spend at least 2 hours here, and certainly make sure you take the small walking routes around the mountain area, especially the narrow path towards the far end of the peninsula. And be prepared to take lots of pictures. It''s extremely popular, but never becomes so crowded that you would not go there; it is really time worth spending."

If you enjoy beautiful ocean and mountain views and especially photography then it is definitely worth the price. There are several routes you can drive through to get to different points. Visit the Lighthouse and the most south west point in Africa. I didnt'spot any marine life so that was a little disappointing but beautiful none the less.They have a beautiful restaurant (Two Oceans) which is a must if you're visiting.

I enjoyed the trail to the new Lighthouse especially at the place where it narrows just directly in front of the old Lighthouse. You could hear the Atlantic Ocean's stormy waters knocking on the cliffs below and the on the other side, a silent and pacific False Bay. It was a contrasting feature and gave me an understanding why Bartholomew Diaz and the rest called the place the Cape of Good Hope. Quite idyllic and ideal for any one. There is a cable car that carries those that are not physically capable of making the trek to the old Lighthouse and the entrance fees not prohibitory."

It's on a national park, its a lighthouse and visitor centre which can be accessed by a funicular railway or for the more athleticly inclined, you can walk.Not really too much to do there other than look out to sea where the Atlantic meets the Indian ocean. Often windy, avoid if very windy as it can knock you off your feet!! Pricing is a bit expensive but OK if its on your bucket list and as a one off."

The Drive from Camps Bay to Cape Point is via the Chapman\u2019s Hill Climb, a mountainous climb with many bends and fantastic views. At the time we started, in the Morning, it was shrouded in the Mist. But later it cleared. In the trip, you can stop by at a semi-precious stone factory and by some souvenirs, which are relatively cheap.Cape Point is the extreme southwestern tip of the African continent in the Republic of South Africa. But southernmost point in Africa is Cape Agulhas, approximately 150 kilometers in the East. The entrance fee is quite high, and then you will have to spend again for the funicular and your refreshments. So keep some Rands handy!! Once in the car park, you see the first peak, the peak that has the old lighthouse on the top. You can take the walk up or take The Flying Dutchman Funicular train. Then you can go to the Old light house. If you are more adventurous like me , then you can take the long trek along the seemingly dangerous cliff edges to the new light house , which is at a lower peak. Don\u2019t worry, even me, with my considerable fear of height could make that trip, and believe me, it was worth the while. ( felt a little breathless on the way up. But OK if you take it slowly )Views from the two light houses and the trek to the new light house are out of this world and a MUST for any nature lover/ Photographer. It seems so remote and utterly beautiful and the best I have seen in SA. Make sure you have enough batteries as you will feel like clicking and clicking.. I don\u2019t advice the trek to the new lighthouse if there is a mist.There are many souvenir shops and restaurants. We decided to go to the best, the Two Oceans. Cape Point is a place on this planet, so full of indescribably magnificent and unbelievably beautiful scenes that I will never forget till the last day of my life\u2026..DONT MISS IT"

There were lots of baboons and a few ignorant tourists who kept on giving food to the animals.

I dont suggest to go there, but the views looking back to the Peninsula are fantastic. Go grab a coffee and sit on the deck outside for views of the coastline.The access to the Cape Point is up a hill so be prepared to climb. I did the walk up and down but there is a funicular available. At the top of the hill is one of the two lighthouses which guard the point. The look out point has panoramic views (and even on a bad weather day, it is quite a dramatic view). There is a walkway which leads to the second lighthouse (the one closest to the end of the Peninsula). The path is steep and uneven so do take your time if you intend to go all the way!"

The views from the path over the bay are just breathtaking , depending on the time of year you will find many beautiful flowers on your way. I just loved loved loved this part of the visit. I saws whales surfacing from the water right below me and had a perfect birds eye view in crystal clear water. There were not too many people walking this path.

The drive took us down some fairly spectacular coastline - we were able to enjoy the beauty of clouds rolling along the dramatic coastline mountains.Unfortunately for us, the clouds actually meant fog, so when we arrived at Cape Point it was completely fogged in. We climbed up the lighthouse & looked out anyway however we could not see the water at all. But that allowed us to concentrate on our senses, and we could feel a marked temperature differential between the warmer air coming from the (nearby) Indian Ocean and the chilly winds on the Atlantic City ocean just by moving from one side of the lookout to the other. If you can't work it out, the basking geckos will show you where they know it to be warmer!Definitely worth going, but if you've got the luxury of selecting between several days of your experience, check and see what the visibility is before you set off!NB: Technically the two oceans meet at Cape Agulhas, which is over 250Km away ... but the warm air/seas currents that originated in the Indian Ocean meet the cold/icy air & sea currents of the Atlantic here."

Head back to the city on the highway or wind your way through Tokai and Constantia to dinner on one of the wine estates. Take a hairbrush and proper shoes along if so."

So much wildlife to spot and every corner has a different stunning view. We drove all the way to the cape point cable cars although didn't go up in one. We took lots of photos - we were there around sunset and it was beautiful, there was lots of mist over the sea which was illuminated by the sun. Brilliant day out for families, couples and groups of friends. You will be charged at the gate and given a map but from there you are free to decide where you go. You can spend an hour here or an entire day - we wish we had more time to explore!"

The views are stunning, the drive through park is really beautiful. We spent a good few hours in the park admiring Cape Point, Cape of Good hope. If you want to make the most, get their early, take your hiking gear, charge your camera batteries, pack some food and water (take your litter out when you leave) and walk around and enjoy nature at its best.Truly a stunning place to visit."

Having family visiting from overseas in October 2015, gave me reason to visit here and I felt \"proudly South African\". From the entrance (fee payable here) to the \"point\" itself, the reserve is maintained in an excellent and clean condition (including toilet facilities). A fantastic meal can be enjoyed at the restaurant with the most gorgeous views you'll see anywhere (priced for tourists). A lovely souvenir shop can be found as you enter/exit the Funicular - that can be used (at an additional cost) to take you to the \"point\". Alternatively, put on your hiking shoes and enjoy the amazing walk to the \"point\" (suggested only for the reasonably fit amongst us). Once at the Cape Point, whip out your camera to record your memories. Enjoy seeing the Indian Ocean on one side and the Atlantic Ocean on the other.... and how they \"meet\". You may be lucky enough to spot dolphins frolicking through the surf, while whales breach the surface of the ocean as they slow dance their way to/from Hermanus. Look back/behind you to bask in the view of the Table Mountain National Park stretching its long arms out - before you slowly make your way back home - possibly stopping at Boulders Beach (in Simonstown) to enjoy the Cape's famous Penquins. Don't forget to stop off in Simonstown and explore the myriad of interesting shops here and the amazing home made ice cream with all its different flavour choices, at the pink caf\u00e9 (to be found along the main road). A fun filled, FULL day, excursion that will bring you home exhausted, but pleased with yourself."

The good thing about going on a winter day is that there are not many people lining up to enter the park, the bad thing is that once you reach the very end of Cape Point, it can be very cold. Cape Point is a great experience and although there are more southern points in South Africa, once you are standing there next to the lighthouse at the very end of Cape Point, it feels like you are at the end of the world. Please be careful not to eat outside the local restaurant. If not careful baboons are literally grasping the food but also bags from your hands."

It is a good exercising walk up to the lighthouse or it can be reached by the \"Flying Dutchman\" funicular railway to the pinnacle. It was very windy and a bit cold so make sure that you have a jacket. The views are spectacular and we are told that whales can be seen at times (we didn't see any).

The ride cost (R55 Rand) so we walked up even with a small baby on a cool day. The views are awesome!

The latter part of the drive to Cape Point hugged the cliffs and seaviews with the odd Baboon sitting along the way.The Cape Point Nature Reserve is so natural and had great history in the age of Portuguese explorers discovering the sea route from Europe to India.It is a must to visit the Lighthouse at the top of The Point either a long walk or a cable tram will get you there.Afterwards take some time to explore the various other parts of the reserve , either by car or hike. Overnight hikers accomodation is available - book in advance."

It was a lovely clear day so there was lots to see especially when we arrived here. Large animals on the roadside and Cape Sugerbirds in the bushes.We went onto the lower car park and watched the oceans swell, seals basking in the sunshine between the rocks and hundreds of cormorants drying their wings. Later we journeyed up to the main car park and walked up to the top where there is a lighthouse, for those of you that don't fancy the numerous steps there is a lift which will take you almost to the top where there is a small museum. Should you wish to have a drink and something to eat there is somewhere you can enjoy the scenary while you eat. If you enjoy watching the waves, wildlife and walking this place is great, Our only regret was we didn't come across any baboons during out time here."

There is also the famous Boulders Beach in Simons Town, where there is a colony of penguins in residence, right on the wild and beautiful coast. At the tip, the Cape of Good Hope, there is a lighthouse worth trekking to ( or be lazy and take the cable car up to near the top). There are souvenir shops and a place to eat something. The waves crashing against the rocky shores is hypnotic, and you can even swim in the sheltered cove near the cable car. Be very careful never to leave your car with windows ajar, or else it could literally be destroyed by the native baboons. Remember, this is their home, and you are merely a visitor here. Enjoy this amazing wild place, it is awe inspiring.and a place to contemplate what we value about or home planet."

When you arrive at the Cape you have a choice - you can either walk up to the top or take the funicular. Both are worth doing - one is cheaper than the other. The views looking out from the top of the Cape are spectacular and the sea has its own special color. Not only should you walk up to the main lighthouse you should also walk out to the much smaller white lighthouse at the end of the point - this is not so highly signposted and is really worth doing.The restaurant at the point also provides good food and a good view of life and it's myriad visitors. A trip to Cape Point would not be complete without also driving down to the Cape of Good Hope - here you can stand on the rocks close to the sea and be captivated by the waves crashing against the rocks."

The drive down the west coast from Cape Town was one of the most spectacular we have done. There was a manned toll booth for this road so have some cash handy. The views on arrival were gobsmacking. We stopped in Simons Town for a coffee on the way down - restaurants, galleries, and a penguin colony. We wished we had a night or two to stay and explore further."

The most southern tip on the Cape Peninsula offers mind-boggling 360-degree views, dramatic scenery, fantastic hiking trails, deserted beaches and a sprinkling of big game in the reserve, some great bird watching, and in spring you might catch a glimpse of a whale close to shore.The restaurant is fabulous and if you don't want to walk up, there's the fun funicular ride. This World heritage site offers visitors everything they could dream of, including some great gifts from the shop to take home to family and friends back home. Just watch out for the baboons - don't feed them under any circumstances and keep your car windows closed - they're known little thieves that will love to relieve you of your possessions or snacks :)"

I've read some reviews saying that not much happens there but clearly they are not fans of tranquil, natural habitats. The reserve is well protected leaving it fairly untouched, particularly noticeable when heading off the main road on one the many walking trails. The views up at the lighthouse give a panoramic view of endless oceans to south, across the bay to the mountainous east and over the Atlantic and up the peninsula coast to the west. Perfect scenes to meditate on the vastness of our world or simply stand in awe of the diversity of mother nature's greatness."

Great photos along the way as well. It is really very romantic as you look down on the Atlantic Ocean. The fog came blowing in while we were there. There is a beautiful light house on the peak that was made after the Portuguese liner Lusitania wrecked here (not to be confused with the Lusitania sunk in WWI by a German sub). The light house was found ineffective due to the fog as well! At this point you are looking literally down at the point where the Atlantic and Indian oceans meet. The fog was blowing in over the Atlantic while we were there and the peak of the cape block and sent the fog high above us so we could see the Indian Ocean very well! Our driver got a sandwich at the shops below while we were hiking and got immediately ill from it--warning! We did pick up a coffee mug at the nice souvenir store up by the light house. It was a wonderful visit and I couldn't imagine coming all this way and not seeing this iconic sight!"

Beatiful mountaineous area, gets very windy in autumn though, prepare for super cold wind especially near the lighthouse. We walked all the way to the lighthouse but you can take the little train too. There are many harder or easier hiking trails available, we walked to cape of good hope (about 1 hour return trip) and visited the stupendous beach on the way. There are also several places where shipwrecks may or may not be visible although one of the main shipwreck trails was closed then due to terrible bushfire a few weeks before. Careful with baboons you can see them feeding on the beach, they can be quite bold there as they are protected - don't feed them!! Just watch at a distance. We also saw a huge antelope, an ostrich and a mongoose on the way!"

We always made a point to get there early to have breakfast at the 2 Oceans restaurant which no doubt has some of the most spectacular views in the country. The restaurant has recently undergone a total revamp including an interior redesign and unfortunately the menu has been completely overhauled too. The new menu is now extremely overpriced and will be unaffordable for most Capetonians. The stuffy choices of food options on the new menu are also downright bizarre and simply don't suit the relaxed, touristy Cape Point atmosphere at all. The entrance ticket to the park has also become incredibly expensive and will itself soon make the trip through the park unaffordable for local families, which is a huge pity as the park is such a beautiful place. Hopefully Cape Point will eventually implement a similar system to many other local tourist attractions where lower prices are offered for local citizens with an SA ID/Passport.My only real genuine complaint about the park is the total lack of visitor information. The only effort made to inform the visitor is a basic DL sized flyer handed to visitors upon entering. Any further information gathering is left to the visitor to self-serve at the half-attempt of a visitors centre a short distance inside the park. Improved signage and information offerings dispersed throughout the park could be vastly improved upon and this would seriously improve the visitor's experience."

We took the funicular to the top; but you can walk as well. It's straight uphill and at the funicular station stop you can still walk up about another 100 ft if you are in shape.

I was in The Cape more than 20 years ago and although the beauty of the place has not changed, i did find that a lot of development has been done around catering for tourists. There are now so many walk ways that if you had the time an energy, you could keep busy for days. The florna and flora is absolutely beautiful, coupled with sandy beaches, cliff faces and aqua blue waters. The highlight is the Cape Point where the two oceans meet (The Atlantic and The Indian Ocean). To get to the point you can either opt to walk up a number of stairs or for a fee catch a Tram ride up. At the top you still will need to walk up some more stairs to the point. The reward at the top is a breath taking 360 degree view of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The Cape Point is a far ride out of Cape Town, but if you take the scenic route past Capmans peak, them the ride becomes a journey filled with hidden treasures and look out points. A must see if this is your first time in Cape Town."

Only then do you reach the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve, which is quite small in area. Some of the animals. like the Bontebok, were introduced from other areas. After a quick visit to blustery Cape Point, it's on through the False Bay side and you pass through more fishing villages and beach resorts, including Boulders Beach with its African penguins, before heading back to central Cape Town. A 2-day trip could include a detour to the neighboring beautuful Constantia valley with its wine estates with their spectacular mountain backdrop - also a great dining area - the Tokai estate, and the pleasant, leafy southern suburbs.

The one thing or rather things to watch out for are the somewhat unruly baboons which apparently have attacked tourists suspected of hoarding food!Misbehaving wildlife aside the views from the lighthouse include the Cape itself as well as a number of wild ostriches and a couple of antelopes we were not able to identify but they would have been either Kudu or Springbok according to the locals.There is a little museum just before the funicular exit that gives a little more information on the park and the lighthouses in the vicinity that is worth pausing a moment at.Beyond that, guests are required to leave before the park closes each evening or face a ZAR500 fine. If you're driving its around a two to two and a half hour visit but there were also cyclists and motor cyclists. But having ones picture taken at the Cape of Good Hope signboard was the culmination of years of reading about the cape and the many sunken ships and drowned sailors there, a thought made even more vivid while looking at the whirlpool just off the cape!Great place to tick off the bucket list!"

Quite a big climb to the light house but you can be idle an take the funicular. If you are prepared to walk, you will get the best out of this trip."

Myself and two friends made the long drive here immediately after arriving at the airport to make sure we beat the rush hour traffic in the evening. The entire drive was amazing!!! We climbed mountains and drove through a small town before arriving at the entrance of the park. Unfortunately for us we had no idea that there was a separate entrance fee from the train car we had seen online so that took a chunk out of our cash on hand. We decided to pay the fee nonetheless thinking it quite steep but later seeing that there are a million things you could do after entering park and how you could spend an entire day there, we understood. It was another 6k or so to get to the actual place where you could take the street car or walk it up to the lighthouse. There is free parking in the parking lot which is quite small and also along the sides of the road, which is where we ended up parking. There were two options available. You could go up to the lighthouse or down to the shore. We opted for the lighthouse since it was way shorter, the alternative would have taken us 1 1/2 hours to go and return. My oh my was it windy that day! Or is it like that everyday???? I literally was being blown off my feet and had to steady myself quite a few times. We decided to make the trek up to the lighthouse since to take the street car was R52 which we had already spent in the entrance fee :( It was a fun walk with my girlfriends and we had jokes for days with people encouraging us, \"You can make it!\" as we struggled to make it to the top. It took us about 20 minutes but it really could have taken us 5 if we hadn't stopped and taken breaks along the way. Oh, and there are plenty of stairs as well, so prepare yourself. We finally made it to the top of the lighthouse and man it was gorgeous! Windy but gorgeous. Had to hold on to my cellphone with both hands while taking pics. I must say parents with small kids should be weary of taking them up there because with all the wind and the altitude our ears were killing us. We saw a mother with a small baby at the top and the child was screaming it's head off. We took a few minutes to peruse the gift shop just to give our ears a break which actually helped as we made our way back down. Definitely a must-see if you are ever in Cape Town!"

There are some small beaches on side road which you could relax or have a picnic at. Some nice trails to walk, especially the one from the old lighthouse where everyone normally goes to the new lighthouse much lower down and closer to the actual end of the land. he views a retsunning from almost anywhere in the park. I'm not sure if the Oceans do actually meet here as I've never seen the clear difference in water or colours. Its possible that the Oceans meet at Cape Aghulas further South East. But if you look closely may see some greenish water near the beaches on the Atlantic side and greyish water on the India Ocean side."

We booked a private tour departing our hotel in Cape Town and took the scenic route down to the Cape.On entering the National Park we headed for the lighthouse, parking close to the train. However, if it is busy be prepared for a long walk from where you park to the base station. The lighthouse is many feet above the base station and you can either walk up the hill or take the train.At the top station the view is good, but the lighthouse is still about 100 stairs up. It is a good climb, the stairs are generally in good condition, but the view from the top is spectacular and well worth expending the energy.During our visit the contrast on either side of the Cape was amazing, to the West it was clear as day, but to the East it was completed covered in fog. On completion we headed down to the Cape sign for a photograph and walk along the beach. The water is shallow and crystal clear.Driving back we saw a family of baboons playing by the side of the road."

Another matter was the heavy smoke of the recent fires. One of the last ones was still very much in progress a few KM's to the North-West, and helicopters and fire fighters were intensively engaged over there. But luckily there was no impact on the Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope itself. This time we also walked from the Cape Point to the Cape of Good Hope.

We travelled via Camps Bay and along Chapman's Peak Drive - a beautiful coastal road right by the rugged shoreline. You pay a fee to enter the reserve and once inside the most popular stopping point is at the bottom of the funicular railway up to the lighthouse on Cape Point. There's a walkway to get right to the end of the coastline, but the view from the lighthouse was good enough for me. I would definitely recommend the funicular as there are still quite a lot of steps once you get up there - it costs about 55rand. You get a good view across the Cape of Good Hope from the lighthouse too. Be wary of snakes and baboons if walking around the reserve. It's also worth visiting nearby Boulders Beach while you are in the area to see the penguins."

There are so many gorgeous views, hiking trails, secluded beaches, wildlife and cliffs to explore. We reached Cape Point around noon and the main areas were already crowded. The hike to the first lighthouse took about 10 to 15 minutes. There is also a funicular ride to the top however the day we visited there was a power outage (we were told that power outages are very common in South Africa) so the funicular was shut down. Once your reach the first lighthouse there is a trail to walk to the second lighthouse. That trail says it will take 1.5 hours round trip. The time really depends on how long you enjoy the view at the end of the trail but it only took us about 40 minutes in total. This trail was very quiet since most of the tourists visit the first lighthouse then turn back around. The views from each trail were unique and beautiful. If you have time make sure to explore a few of the trails. If we ever return to Cape Town we will certainly return to Cape Point to explore other hiking trails."

It came as a bit of shock to see ostriches roaming the sandy shoreline - I expected to see the ubiquitous baboons (which we did) but not these mighty birds and their young. But there they were in all their glory. Although they're fairly relaxed at the sight of us human rubber-neckers in our tin boxes remember they are wild creatures and shouldn't be approached. The park is covered in fynbos, from which I detected a slight honey aroma from the many hundreds of different herbs, grasses and flowers that constitute it. I think that we're all aware of 'everlasting' flowers, the dry, often artificially coloured ones found in flower arrangements, but here in the park they abound in such profusion they appear to make up drifts of white, to the extent it's called, locally, Cape Snow. A word to the wary, remember that puff adders live in this environment. If bitten you've got approximately 2 hours to be treated with anti-venom. But as most snake bites are 'dry' it shouldn't pose too much of a problem if you decide to get out of the car for a wander.Animal life abounds of course; eland, springbok, buck and kudu. Zebra and porcupines are in there somewhere as well but we didn't see any. Bird life is stunning; everything from soaring raptors to red-legged oyster catchers patrolling the rocks along the beaches and enough cormorants to make you become bored with the subject.In short Cape Point Nature Reserve an excellent half day out (at least) and the longer you stay the better it is."

It's a steep walk but worth the trouble. Some wildlife to see.

Even if all you do here is take the arial tram up to the lighthouse, this is a world class place to visit - the point where the Indian and Atlantic Oceans meet, where Vasco da Gama and Bartholomeo Diaz sailed, where the vistas are absolutely breathtaking. Once called the depressing Cape of Stones, the name was changed to the more positive Cape of Good Hope. At the most basic level, you can come and take the funicular almost to the top, and then climb the stairs the rest of the way to the light house to see the views. For the more ambitious, there is a trail to the top, where hikers can savor the vistas along the way. But the park has much more to offer. There is the Oliphant Hotel for those who want to spend more than an hour or so, and enjoy the reserve and it's views after the tourists leave or early in the morning. One can also camp there in the open. Either way, there are lots of nature trails and beautiful beaches to explore. The wildlife - flora and fauna - is extensive, and one needs to be prepared to even see ostriches wandering the rocky beaches!Even though there are lots of tourists, the flow in the main areas is good, and there are very few people wandering in the less trafficked areas. Christmas is perhaps the most difficult time to visit, as lines for entry and for the funicular can stretch pretty far back."

The side road down to the Cape of Good Hope carries fewer cars and coaches, offers access to beaches, seabird colonies and a short climb that reveals great seascapes. There are super views across False Bay from the Rooikrans turning. Picnic on the grass by the sea at Buffels Bay or take the longer Olifantsbos Bay turn where we saw bontebok on the beach.

But as long as you aware of that, you can survive them. Do not carry packets, do not wave your food around, do not feed them and keep your distance and you'll be fine. Don't braai in the park - It's just not worth it, because baboons spoil it and you just cannot relax as you are permanently looking out for them.

It is part of the Table Mountain National Park, and can be entered with a Wild/Green Card. There are several bus tours into the Reserve, or you can go on a privately guided tour. Enquire at your nearest Tourism Bureau when in the Western Cape for more information. There is a scenic drive through the reserve where you may encounter many different animals, including Zebra, Ostrich, Baboons, and different Species of buck. There is a large diversity of Fynbos species, depending on the time of year, and you can enjoy the beautiful Proteas, Erica's, Leucodendrons, Pincushions, Everlastings and many different Species of Restio' (natural, hardy reeds). You may be lucky to spot a number of different bird species, including Seagulls, Black Harrier, Black Shouldered Kite, Yellow-Billed Kite, Steppe Buzzards, Orange Breasted and Malachite Sunbirds,Cape Robin Chat and Protea Canary, to name but a few.The drive will take you right down to the Cape Point, where there is a lovely restaurant, where you can enjoy lunch, and sample some of the local wines. There is a also a tram which goes to the huge Cape Point Lighthouse, where you can breathe in the fresh sea air, and enjoy the beautiful 360 degree views. Be careful not to feed the baboons, they are wild animals and become a nuisance, if you try and feed them.All in all, it is a wonderful day's outing to be enjoyed by young and old, and definately worth a visit if you are a visitor to the area....enjoy it!! :)"

We drove through Chapman's Peak (a nail-biting yet scenic drive), and also passed several cute towns along the way. We arrived at the Nature Reserve around noon, and there were no lines to get in. We walked up to Cape Point instead of taking the funicular. The walk definitely got our blood pumping, and we had a few baboons surprise us during the walk. The view from the top was spectacular and well worth the journey.We also took the obligatory picture at the Cape of Good Hope sign. Please watch out for ostriches in the road on the way - they are stubborn and will not move out of the way. Afterwards, we stopped by Boulders Beach to see the adorable penguins and drove through charming Simon's Town. It was such a lovely day, and I'm glad we did the drive on our own instead of booking a tour."

We only managed Cape Point due to time restrictions. There was a bit if a queue for the Funicular Railway, so we decided to walk up, it's not something for the elderly or unfit, but not too demanding and a great way to slowly see the views before you get to the top."

You can also stop off at the little towns on the way such as Simon's Town for the Penguins. Entry to the park is 110R and the main attraction is Cape Point which offers excellent views. There is a small funicular train - \"Flying Dutchman\" that takes you up to the first lighthouse at Cape Point, but its an easy walk up if you are relatively fit. From there make sure you take the walking trail that leads down to the actual \"point\" which is the southerly most tip (only Cape Agulhus is more southerly). When I went it was quite windy which made the scenery quite dramatic with large waves crashing in against the point. After taking in the Cape Point you can have lunch at the restaurant or snack shop after which you can hike to the Cape of Good Hope. This takes a couple of hours and takes you away from the crowds but you need to be relatively fit as at points you need to clamber over rocks. Along the trail you can also visit Dias beach although there are lots of steps to tackle both down and up but well worth it as when I went there were only 2 other people on the beach, although its not safe to swim. Its also possible to drive to the Cape of Good Hope but you end up at the car park at the bottom of the cliff, but hiking you get the views from the top! The hike is also a lovely opportunity to take in the wildlife and during my hike I came across a couple of Eland and a Dassie. Whist driving through the park you may be lucky to see Ostrich and Baboon's too!In summary a fantastic day with some lovely walking trails, beautiful scenery and wildlife."

We saw tiny tortoises making their way through the rocks, baboons, buck and ostrich walking along the rocky outcrops or sandy dunes.There are a few designated picnic areas at some of the beaches, but you still have to watch out for baboons as they are quite brave and used to the presence of people, so have no problem approaching you to steal some food.Definitely worth a visit, but you have to make a plan for the entire day!

The wind meant there were pretty good waves too.The wind was such that we didn't take the trip (walk or funicular) to the lighthouse, but spent time wandering near Cape Point and stopping off along the roads for a closer look at the plants. Saw (well, almost met) an ostrich and chicks - it was determined to check if we had food in the car - and a couple of the relatively rare Cape (or Mountain) Zebra.One tip is to get into the 2 Oceans Restaurant there earlyish (even to book) as it fills up pretty rapidly from about 12:15/12:30 - relatively expensive but very good"

I gave it five stars but we got there early by car (about 10 am). By the time we were leaving there were queues of cars to get into the park, and once inside looking for parking. I imagine if I had arrived later it wouldnt have been as enjoyable because of this and I would have rated it lower. We walked up to the old lighthouse which was steepish walk but on a good path (you can take the mini train but it costs more and you can't stop to look at the views on the way up). From there you can do a further walk along the actual point. It says it takes about 1.5 hours for the loop but actually it was about 30 minutes. Overall, a must do stop as part of a longer trip around the peninsula. Best in sunny weather otherwise you probably won't see much!"

The drive through the Cape Point Nature Reserves, gives you a number of view points to stop at before you get to Cape Point, so stop off and take in the other views. Along the way you will spot a number of species, such as Zebra, Eland etc. Beware of the Baboons as they have become accustomed to being fed and can become aggressive. At Cape Point we took the funicular to the Light House, due mainly to the time we had. The views are spectacular back toward Cape Town and over to the Cape of Good Hope, which is another place to stop on your tour around. Well worth the visit, although next time we will get there earlier in order to do some of the walks along the cliff paths to Cape Point."

The cormorants took the thermals and with their legs hanging down ready to alight onto their crag-like cliffs in the adverse wind. The area is in one of the six Floral Kingdoms of the world where unusual species of plants known as fynbos ( fine bush) have survived the howling gales. Here you can see Eland, Zebra, baboons and gemsbok. There are mountain trails, swimming beaches and one can either be part of the tourist scene with restaurant and souvenir shops or you can explore unspoiled terrain, protected from the ravages of time. There is a good information centre. The ablution blocks and all the buildings are designed to blend into the natural scenery, and are of mountain stone with roof gardens. You can either walk to the lighthouse or take the funicular. There is an entrance fee into the park, but when one considers the privilege one has of being able to experience this sensitive area of incredible beauty, more or less 10 $ is a small price to pay. Just be aware of the baboons and do not walk around with food."

A must-visit destination."

Head south past Sea Point, Camps Bay and Hout Bay to enjoy the stunning Chapman's Peak Drive, and then through Kommetjie and the usually misty Misty Cliffs to reach the entrance. Once in the park, take it slow. You could easily spend four hours meandering along the side roads before getting to the 'Point'. These side trips offer stunning floral scenery in winter and spring, as well as opportunities to see baboon, bontebok, zebra, eland, ostrich and more. Look out for tortoises on the road - if you see one, you're likely to see several. There are many hikes along the coastline, and if your preference is to avoid the bustle of tourists pouring out of the busses at the 'main attraction', you can expect plenty of peace and quiet on these trails. The shipwreck trail is well worth doing, and look out for dolphins if you venture out to Venus pool."

We had so little time that we could not make it up to the lighthouse or even to the point itself. That did not matter, it feels good being there, a powerful force of nature and 'feeling the presence of oceans coming together'. Due to time constraints, we also did not visit the Nature Reserve. Will certainly get back another time.On the way back to Hout Bay (via Simons's Town, Constanza), we got stuck in traffic at several occasions, specifically around traffic lights that were not functioning (power load shedding?).

At Cape Point we took the funicular up to the top and then the short walk to the \"first\" lighthouse and the great views from there. Then back down to near the top funicular station before taking the 1.5 mile path to view the second (newest) lighthouse and Cape Point itself. So dramatic and wild, really not to be missed. Warning, you need to watch out for the wind on parts of the path on the day we were there, but we didn't feel in danger. Also, there are long slopes and steps down on the way so it's quite a climb back up, but nothing too wearisome to worry about.We then went to the Cape of Good Hope, a long walk from Cape Point, or a road connection a little way from the car park. Tremendous waves, huge spray, rocky coast, seals on the rocks. Well worth the visit."

We saw whales, seals, elan, turtles, geckos, ostrich, and lots of birds. If you can get to the botanical gardens before coming that's even better because then you have a sense of the different endemic plants and why they have evolved as they have, and what's important about them. But just wander about and enjoy the incredible beauty of the scenery, the flowers, and the stupendous cliffs. It's awesome!"

After entering the national park ostriches and deers can be seen along the way. Cape of Good Hope is at the foothill and to see Cape Point, either one can climb the steps (not for elderly and with medical conditions) or take the funicular to reach to the top of the original lighthouse. From there the view of the Cape at which two oceans meet is breathtaking. We were lucky to be there on a sunny day and without too much wind. On the return trip, it is recommended to take the route via the Indian Ocean shoreline and visit the African Penguin habitat. Take a coach tour to avoid driving and soak in the beautiful scenes along the entire trip. Plan for a day trip."

The walk from the parking to the lighthouse can be a slog, but for those not up for the challenge, the funicular takes one up in style. Just sitting and hearing all the accents and languages makes one realize, how well visited this place is - from Dutch to Portuguese to Turkish to German to Japanese - a really well visited site.Several hikes can be done, but one needs to spend more time to be able to enjoy that. There is a nice walk to the bottom, that that takes about 45 minutes and longer. Several ostriches can be seen from time to time.

I would recommend to buy a Wildcard if you are going to visit more than one south african national park or SAN park, with this card entrance is free, and you can buy it per person, couple or family.you can bring your own wood and make lunch on one of the fireplaces next to the beach, or you can have an amazing meal at the two oceans restaurant with breathtaking views. Also make sure to visit the Lighthouse. There is a small cable way but the walk is not to bad. Also try to visit all the beaches and walk around. (no lions) Enjoy"

This has to be one of if not the most scenic places I have ever been, the drive from Cape Town is simply amazing, the park itself offers great scenery and great photo opps! We had lunch in the only restaurant in the park and it was beautiful! We walked on deserted beaches, deserted by people that is as we did come across a baboon and an ostrich walking side by side! This really is a remarkable place"

The tour buses seem to stick to the two main attractions of the reserve so the rest is not crowded. It is incredibly windy at the lighthouse, and there is a lot of walking and stairs to climb so dress accordingly. We tried to walk towards the actual point from the lighthouse but a HUGE baboon was in the way and us two small women backed off. Next time I will be going with my big husband :) We saw a few other animals, including ostrich with babies and a small tortoise which was my favourite sighting of the day. There is a fancy restaurant and a small cafe that sells pizza and sandwiches. We shared a footlong baguette with chicken avocado and watercress. It was good, all the ingredients were very fresh. I have gluten issues but it was worth the suffering for that sandwich! Unfortunately had time constraints and had to rush our visit, it deserves a full day of your time. Pricey, but that keeps the masses out which in turn keeps the bush intact and litter down. Hope to go back soon and make use of the braai (bbq) area."

Manage to walk to the top (you can take a cable car) and the views from each angle were just spectacular. Extremely windy though so watch out for crazy hair in your pics. I didn't not see any baboons but they are around and apparently dangerous. Please do not feed them as they become even more aggressive and need to be put down. The entrance to the park is 110 local currency. Toilets are available and free."

One could walk all the way to the top of the hill where the light house is (15-20 minutes) or take the Funicular for a fee. The vista as one goes up to the light house is magnificent. The Cape of Good Hope is visible in the distance, and the trail is line with pretty flowers in bloom. From the light house, one can have stunning views of the Atlantic ocean. Without pressure to get back to the tour bus in one hour, one can spend a lot more time in this location. A good time well spent."

It's not overly difficult and has wooden boardwalks, but it's steep in places. Park your car at the Cape of Good Hope, head up towards Cape Point. Make sure to walk down to Dias Beach on the right, it's stunning, then come back up and continue. At Cape Point you'll find restrooms, food (Two Oceans restaurant is quite good), and a tram up to the lighthouse (if you feel like it, you can just walk up). Watch for baboons around Cape Point, both at the station and on the hike, they are there most of the time. You can also take a walk to the new lighthouse.It's very windy most of the time here and light rain can come at any minute, so bring a windbreaker. The previous time I was there it was quite nice, but this time the wind was so strong it was uncomfortable.When you drive around the park, watch for antelopes. We saw several ostriches near Cape of Good Hope and also a bunch of them near the sand dunes, make sure to stop by there. That should take you about a day. If you have more time, there are plenty more walks around this beautiful nature reserve."

            "review": "Especially wonderful on a stormy day. We went to Cape Point as part of our Road Scholar Tour during the winter on a day that was expected to be very stormy and we were not disappointed. The prior name of the Cape of Good Hope was Cape of Storms and the day we visited it lived up to that title. Rather than detracting from the experience, the stormy weather (including hail) enhanced the wonderful experience. Remember that this is an old sailing location and many ships have gone down in the area ... so experiencing it that way makes for a wonderful time. You really need to be part of a tour or have a car to do this trip. It is not far from Cape Town but the point is part of an national park and driving around is well worth it with different vistas and experiences wherever you go. Perhaps the least important (except for the photographic opportunity) aspect is the actual place of the Cape of Good Hope (with signs in two of South Africa's 11 official languages -- English and Afrikans). And, if you are interested in such stuff (and I am) be sure to check out the online disputes as to whether the place where the Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean meet is actually here or at Cape Agulhas. (Short answer: Cape Agulhas is where the oceans official meet and is the southernmost point on the African continent; Cape of Good Hope is the southwesternmost point on the continent and where its supporters claim the Indian and Atlantic ocean currents meet -- although the Agulhas people claim the currents move up and down the coast a lot depending on the season. However this is no way affects the picturesque aspect of Cape Point.)Right near the cape is a lighthouse which you get to by going up a steep road, parking in a big parking lot, and then taking a funicular up and finally climbing some steps up to the lighthouse itself and the surrounding area. It is not difficult but does take some climbing. On a windy stormy day it can really blow you around when climbing (about the only thing in my experience I can equate it to is nearly being blown off of Palmer and Goudier Islands on the Antarctic peninsula). But the views are magnificent and well worth it. If you don't want to climb the final steps, there is a building you are in when exiting the funicular.One issue that I know only by being told. There are a lot of baboons at the lighthouse area and they are quite aggressive. They have been known to have grabbed backpacks off people if there is food in them and they can be dangerous. Of course, the added advantage of being there on a windy stormy day was that the baboons were nowhere to be seen -- having more sense to be out of the storm than we had."

At the Cape of Good Hope, we felt like explorers- the sun was out; it was raining; there were wild winds; and then it would repeat- in about five minutes! The funicular up to the lighthouse was easy, and the view from the lighthouse was fantastic. Mark had told us to not have any food anywhere on us including in purses. The baboons will get it no matter what. If they come for you, just give them whatever they want. We did not have food on us, so we were fine. On the way back, we stopped at Boulder Beach to see the Penguin colony. They were a delight.

At the Cape of Good Hope there are thousands of birds including Artic Tern and Cormarants. There was also a large colony of seals. The lighthouse at Cape Point is built at the top of a promitory and is so high that it is invariably fogged in and so another had to be built lower down. There is a funicular railway to take you to the top, cost 55 rand, or you can walk up and down. From here we visited the Penguins at Boulder Beach and watched these long mated critters waddling around. Again worth a visit. Simondstown a former UK Naval Base and now manned by the South African Navy is on the return road to Cape Town."

While we were looking out from the lighthouse area we spotted a Southern Right Whale lolling about in the sea below us and that made our day! Penguin bay on the way back was also excellent for a stop."

If you've come to Cape Town, do not miss taking a day to tour the Cape Peninsula, all the way to Cape Point, the southernmost spot on the African continent. You'll find a sign there for a memorable photo. The scenery is vast and beautiful, with changing looks as mist and clouds change the view. You'll also have the fun of seeing ostriches and baboons along the way! There's a good restaurant available at the base of the lighthouse, food quality was very good. On the way out to Cape Point, before entering the park, we stopped at Kalk Village. It has a touristy side with interesting art galleries and nice boutiques, but Kalk is also a commercial fishing port. Walk out on the pier and see the fishing fleet up close. You're also likely to see some large seals that are swimming close to the pier, as well as several that have climbed up on to the pier itself and are enjoying a bit of sunbathing. Good photo op!"

Having stopped to watch and photograph two male ostrich fighting I saw a large male approach from behind, before we knew it he had opened the rear passenger, got in and was sat on the back seat. Luckily we were so surprised that neither of us panicked. I tried to get my rucksack from the footwell behind me, as there were pears in it and I thought I would throw them out, but he wanted my bag and having shown me his teeth and growled I had no intention of arguing with him. He took the bag and sat beside the car, this gave us the opportunity to close and lock the doors.

There is lots to see starting off with a tour of the West side of Capetown and the twelve apostles. There is an optional seal island tour which is well worth the short visit. The road has some incredible terrain and it is best done by a tour guide and not in a rental car. The nature reserve is where the light house and Cape of Good Hope is. To maximize your time there, I suggest you bring snacks or a lunch with you. The restaurant is crowded and your time is better spent touring and enjoying the grounds. There is a snack shop there and an outdoor eating facility. The last stop on the tour is the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens and it by itself is an entire day to see and tour. Our guide with Thompson tours was an encyclopedia of knowledge and it one of the few times I over tipped on purpose."

We climbed up the rocks at Cape Point and found that it was very windy at the top. Not many others had attempted the climb which was not difficult and was worth the view. We took the funicular to the light house which was a delightful short trip. We read on other reviews to get there early but as we were out of season it was not busy even by early afternoon."

As a visitor to our country or as a local.. this is a must see!The ocean seems to go on forever - pick a clear day and you will get the most incredible photo's to take home. You do need to have money on you - there is an entrance fee.. you will enjoy this visit but it can be a little expensive for large families/groups. There is plenty of parking and there are plenty of security persons around. Look out for baboons - don't feed them please!You have the option to walk up to the entrance or take the fenicular (which is a great experience and kids LOVE it).It can get intensely windy so expect a 'bad hair day' (lol). This is definitely worth the visit and for photographs - perfect!! There are amazing views, plants.. the lighthouse, the fenicular, the people all make for stunning photo's.For wheelchairs/strollers - there is access to a point as the fenicular will take you up where you can see the views but then there are stairs going all the way up to the lighthouse for an all-round view."

You can either climb to the top of the hill (where the best view is seen) or take a cable car/mini train. We took the train, which was not full up at all and got us to the top quickly. The layout of the pathways at the top is done really nicely so to allow people to walk to different points on the edge of the cliffs and catch different views. The view itself is incredible and what's even better is you can see all round (360 degrees). There is also good for sale in a restraint which is cheap and tasty, but watch out for the birds there - one tried to take food right out of my hand haha...also, the baboons are mischievous (we saw two trying to open a car door), but not harmful as long as you're careful. It's a great place worth visiting - it would be a shame to miss this spot out."

I don't know if they were at the right place then :)We always make this a day trip and never get sick of it. As soon as you enter the gates you will see almost the entire False Bay on your left. You can see as far as Rooi Els on the other side of the False Bay. There are many animals too be seen here if you look closely and drive slowly.There are a few roads that leads to the ocean where you can have a picnic or relax. Buffels Bay being one of them.Drive all the way to the end where you will find the lighthouse and restaurant area. If you are on a self drive mission be sure to lock your car when you leave, the baboons are very clever and know how to open car doors ;)..you can either walk up to the lighthouse or take a tram. I prefer walking because I need the exercise. Many people just go to the lighthouse (the old white one at the very top) but never walk down the other side to the one lower down.If you are really lucky and stay a while you might see schools of dolphins swimming close to the coast line. Not too far from the lighthouse you will also find where the Indian and Atlantic Oceans meet. There are still people that believe Cape Point is the Southern most tip of Africa, which is not true. That will be Cape Agulhas.Be aware that the wind can really get out of hand here so always bring something warm just for in case. This really is a MUST SEE when visiting Cape Town."

And it keeps getting better the higher you go! Just when you think it can't get any better, it does!!!! Cape of Good Hope itself isn't suitable for older people or those with trouble climbing stairs. Although there is a cable car service that takes you up, nothing beats walking up those steps and looking at the view. Very crowded at all times.Cape point itself is less remarkable, but for the braver ones there's a cliff you could climb up to via some steep stairs to get a tourist pic :)During winter the flora and fauna is limited. But we did encounter alpacas, springbucks, ostriches and a few very endagered African oystercatchers! Definitely worth a visit :)"

I had come earlier in the week on a guided bus tour while my husband was at a conference and knew he couldn't leave Cape Town without seeing the area so we took a long detour to Cape Point on our way from Cape Town to Hermanus. While the weather wasn't as good as the day of the bus tour it was still spectacular - maybe more so as the ocean was quite wild. We managed our timing fairly well to go down to the actual Cape of Good Hope and up to the lighthouse without getting too wet. Saw lots of baboons - some stealing people's lunch bags (not a good thing for the baboons). We had lunch at the restaurant and it was very good. I would recommend going on a guided tour as you will get more information and enlightenment than driving down on your own."

Take a day tour to this area because it is truly spectacular in its wild beauty, the colours and textures of the mountains and sea are just wonderful. As a bonus, you can spot orang-utans in the middle of the road, free ostriches and many other local birds. Cape Point and the lighthouse area is a touristy place and full of people. That doesn't rest beauty to the place, which is stunning in its rusticity and wilderness, or makes the colours of the rocks, vegetation and the ocean less stunning, or shuts down the sound of the ocean battering against the rocks. The way the area has been transformed to allow visitors to enjoy the surrounding area is remarkable, with plenty of curvaceous stony balconies and stairs that follow the natural shape of the mountain and allow you to have amazing views of almost every corner. The ascend and/or descend to the lighthouse can be done by foot (which is what I recommend), and takes about 10-15 minutes, or by the on-site funicular, which comes handy if you have little time or some mobility problems.The lighthouse itself is a historical piece with some informative panels around. The views from the top are spectacular. The whole wall at the lookout area is covered by graffiti! and the place is full of people wanting to take photos of themselves and pushing other people out to take their photos. I never like that, but the views are just stunning. If you drive, get there early morning, because it is mayhem at around midday, when most tour operators get there. There are two food places, a fast food one, and a normal restaurant. I tried the first and it was nothing remarkable, but the food came out quickly and it was fuel for my stomach.The funicular costs 40 Rands one way. If you are short of time, take the funicular to go up and come down by foot. MINDMind the orang-utans, they are wild and can be aggressive if you are carrying food. Have your food before starting the ascend to the lighthouse. Some of the blackbirds around (from the crow family) can be also annoying if they see you eating outside."

Our destination was the Cape Point Lighthouse. We rode the tram up as far as it went, and then got plenty of exercise walking the steps to get up to the lighthouse. There are also several really nice-looking trails to walk, all of which have spectacular views. There is a nice gift shop up there, as well. I would love to be able to spend time exploring the paths around the lighthouse and just checking out the plant life in the park. The area around the lighthouse is not for people who are seriously afraid of heights or who are mobility impaired. Oh, did I mention that the views are absolutely spectacular? Well worth a visit."

Some incredible sights and photograph opportunities, and just astonishing natural scenery.We've driven along California's Pacific Route One, and as much as I enjoyed it, dare I say that I found the drive to (and through) Cape Point Nature Reserve to be superior.It is a must-see sight for tourists and residents of Cape Town, and I cannot recommend it highly enough."

The park is pristine and quiet with abundant birdlife for those looking carefully. The sunbirds are especially beautiful and look out for ostriches and tortoises! Make time for a hike. There are short easy hikes as well as slightly longer hikes of about three hours. They will reward you with the most breathtaking views you can imagine, and will allow you to feel a very special connection with nature. More often than not you will be completely alone with no other hikers present. As it is a national park with restricted entry, it is perfectly safe to wander all over enjoying the views and the vegetation. Please remember to take water and refreshments and remember to leave only your footprints when you go."

If you're short of time or lack the brainpower to plan/ think for yourself, a bus tour from the city would probably suffice, but you really are just limiting yourself to the lighthouse viewpoint, the Cape of Good Hope sign photo and a tour of the gift shop. Having said that, the bus tours are popular and there are LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS of buses at the lighthouse carpark.The walk up to the lighthouse is beautiful (but steep) and the scenery is stunning. If you're short of time or unable to manage the walk, the funicular is really good and wasnt expensive at all. Whilst up at the (old) lighthouse, it's worth doing the walk to the lower (new) lighthouse - it never takes the 1 hour 30 minutes stated on the sign. Absolutely stunning views down the sheer cliffs. About 20 minutes gets you to the end of the path and having had time for plenty photos along the way. Lots of black agama lizards lying in the sun.In the past few years we've usually seen a few eland grazing in the fynbos near the toilets / lighthouse carpark. The bigger herd of eland is a bit skittish and people-shy.Platboom beach is our favourite. White sands and turquoise water. Bontebok and ostrich usually found there. We've also seen rhebok there, and have been mugged by baboons when one of the party was carrying his sandwich in open view (our own fault, really). The walk to the Thomas T Tucker wreck from Olifantsbos is stunning late afternoon, with fynbos on one side and crashing waves on the other. Not a lot of the wreck left these days. More recently we've done bits of the Sirkelvlei walk from the same carpark and you get some really good views back up the Atlantic coastline.We've seen puffadders twice and hartebees once. Still keep hoping to finally see the zebras, but no such luck in 10 years of regular visits.This is nature at its finest, and we love being out amongst it, taking it slow. Usually we do Cape Point as a half day, combined with a half day at Simons Town and Kalk Bay etc. Sometimes we make a full day of it.If you see people doing illegal things (like loading tortoises into cars), please make a note of their car reg and let the staff at the HQ know - they really do act promptly if they have something to go on."

Our driver stopped along the road at a beautiful park to use restrooms and see the views. We took a boat to see the seals (an extra fee trip). Though I've seen lots of seals in Oregon these are a different kind and was an interesting side venture. We had lunch at a lovely restaurant with many choices. Then on to see African Penguins at Boulder's Beach. Our last stop was Kirstenbock Gardens which, though not heavily in flower at this time, was beautiful, relaxing and fascinating for those of us interested in plants.

            "review": "You sort of have to go. It is dramatic once you get there. A fee for the entrance and another for the funicular. As in international traveller, you have to be going to quite a few SANparks to make it worth buying a wild card, but the fees do add up but not enough to buy a card. I did work it out roughly before we left home.The funicular is quick and regular, it was working fine when we were there. Every 3 minutes. If your time is limited its definitely worth it. There are still quite a few steps to climb to get to the lighthouse and it can be a bit crowded up there. The view is great and the ocean crashing below is spectacular. The park it self was a little disappointing as no wildlife was spotted but a lovely drive. Getting there was a nice day, out but mainly for the other sights on the way there and back.The restaurant is on the entrance level not at the top, very good food, very busy, service flaky."

Pack a picnic as the restaurants are full of tourists who arrive in bus loads. Take the funicular up and walk to the cliff edge for stunning photos if you're fit enough. Lots of historical monuments, so educational as well."

Hank and his wife Carmelita,owners of Ulungeletours did a wonderful job with airport transfers, driving me to and from locations in Capetown, and taking me on a private tour to Cape point and the Cape of Good hope. They were reliably on time, always kept in touch and always had a pristine vehicle. Hank provided great tips on driving in SA, was always friendly yet professional, and provided positive suggestions that made me comfortable to explore the city on my own. I would definitely recommend Ulungeletours to any woman travelling on her own to the Capetown area."

We parked at Cape Point and walked up to the lighthouse (even if we had wanted to take the funicular we wouldn't have been able to as it was broken - this was a real problem for elderly people and those in wheelchairs - not sure how they managed the steps).We also visited the Cape of Good Hope and spotted baboons, ostriches and some sort of antelope. Most visitors did exactly what we did so there were always crowds of people wherever we went, however, the park is enormous and it would be easy to get away from people if that is what you want."

            "review": "This is THE highlight of the Cape Peninsula. The Cape Point area of the Table Mountain National Park is so much more than just the Cape of Good Hope and its lighthouses - although, they are great too.Firstly, this is a national park, so wild-life and landscape are some of the main attractions here. And to really appreciate them, you need to take some time and let it soak in, so give your self 2 days or more (you could do the main parts in 1, so your choice...)The history of the place can be found on your friend Wiki and updates about the Park can be found on the website (http://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/tourism/attractions.php#goodhope ).Now what to do...Day 1.Starting with the lighthouses: They are at the furthest of the park, so you will need to drive down to Cape Point. There is a walk up to the highest one (or you can take the tram for a fee), and the views are spectacular! But dont stop there...go for a walk to the lower light house as well. On your left hand side, you will most likely see some Cape Fur Seals swimming around in the surf and the views back up to the highest lighthouse are incredible. (NB work is being completed on the walkway to the lower lighthouse, but you can still walk some of the way).Avoid the restaurant, unless you are desperate for food (mainly greasy items like pizza) and bring your own, or drive to the Braai area at Buffels Bay Beach.Now you have 2 options - there is a walking trail to the Cape of Good Hope (highly recommended) or you can drive around there (NB if you walk, you will need to return by the same track). Once there, you can do the obligatory tourist photo with the sign :-), but dont just leave it at that. Let your senses soak in the winds and surrounds of the famous point that was used to lift the morale of sailors in the early days of international shipping.And for something a little different; if you look at the path that leads to Cape Point, you will notice 2 minor paths that lead to the bottom of the cliff face, take the 2nd (that leads \"higher\") and follow it around the first headland for a great view towards Cape Point and nests of birds in the cliffs, across, above and even underneath you (this path is wide and higher than the waves crash, but does involve some minor stepping over of rocks).Spend the later afternoon at Buffels Bay, doing some minor walks along the False Bay coast, having a swim (not patrolled), or cooking up some early dinner. Stay until about 1630/1700 hrs and some Ostriches usually appear - they are timid and will run away if approached, but are very relaxing to watch at the end of a day.On your way out stop your car alongside the road where you saw people sitting to keep the baboons at bay - the people have gone home, and the baboons come out. From inside your car, you will get to enjoy the little \"children\" learning to jump on top of their older brothers and sisters, plus the usual stroking of hair of mothers and children and rough-n-tumble of the youth.(NB stay inside your car).Drive back to your accommodation, but stop by Scarborough for a sunset you will not likely forget.Day 2.Check out the wild life (mountain zebra, eland, Cape grysbok, or red hartebeest), wild flowers (Cape Snow, sewejaartjie aree amongst the 1200 in the Cape region) and wild hills as you drive through less less visited part of the Peninsula. Take a walk along the shipwreck coast, on the western side of the park near Olifantsbos. Some of the wrecks are amazing (pieces strewn across broad distances) and one time I nearly stood on a young Cape Fur Seal (1m long) who was sunning itself and enjoying being on the sand (and also oblivious to me). The walk to the Thomas T Tucker is quite easy (about 90 min) and highly recommended, or continue walking along the shipwreck circuit.For the second half of the day, head across to Black Rocks and walk up to the Venus Pool (with its green and orange waters) for a wander along the south western shores of False Bay. Or wander inland to Sirkelsvlei (a largish inland lake) (4 hours).Have a Braai again either in the same area, or return to Buffels Bay to end your stay, knowing that you have experienced the Cape more than most tourists.Please note: Always check with National Parks staff re conditions, closing times of the parks and other safety issues."

If you're in reasonable shape, really no reason to use the funicular, as the drive is quite easy and not that long. Be alert and look for all the little observation points on the way up. There will be lots of sea birds to watch, and if you're lucky, also baboons. Don't miss the extra half an hour walk (both ways to the furthest point, just above the lower and newer light tower. It's all amazingly beautiful."

Game in the reserve is not that easy to spot although the ostriches are not at all bothered by humans. Go down to the vast beaches and have a customary picture taken at the Cape point sign board. Then head up to the departure point for the light house. The restaurant is excellent with a particularly good seafood platter. A funicular runs up to the light house but I recommend the 15 minute walk to stop along the way to enjoy the beautiful scenery. There are any viewing spots around the light house from which you can view South west Africa's southern most point."

The reason why Cape Point nature reserve is not worth a visit is because the entrance fee isoverpriced - R105.00 per person, so if you have a car (like we did) with 5 persons, you then payover R500 to see bush and only if you are lucky you will see one or two baboons. Once you arein and you want to travel with the sky-train to the very top, you then have to pay a further R52.00 per person or walk uphill for 1 hour. Your only other choice to to eat in the restaurant whichis full with bus tourists. Don't waste your time and money to travel there rather use it for manyof the wonderful places to visit in Cape Town and her surrounding areas."
