It's quite a walk to the tower as it stands at the \"gateway\" to Lisbon but is worth the walk to view the building. What isn't so good is the fiendishly long queue to get into the building. It was so long and didn't seem to be getting any shorter so we didn't even bother to try and get in. Maybe if you went early morning or later in the day things would be better. So as I say,by all means go there if you want a nice stroll along the river but don't expect any more unless you have time to burn."

The reason is that the ticket counter didn't really tell us that there is a long line up right after you bought the ticket. Not to mention that there was another line up to get the ticket. I only went to the basement, which is very tiny. When I went to the first level, we realized that there were lots of people lining up to get to the top. We didn't want to wait in the sun, so we left. Unless you are really attached to Vasco da Gama, just enjoy the surrounding, which is quite beautiful."

If travelling to Belem to see the Monastery then it is worth getting a combined ticket for the Belem Tower (Torre) at the same time, otherwise you will have to stand in another long queue. You can catch the Tram 15 from outside the Cais do Sodre station to get to Belem.The tower itself is in a lovely setting on the edge of the water and is considered to be the best surviving example of Manueline architecture. It is an interesting place although it is a bit of a mission getting around once inside the tower. The queue to get to the upper levels was very slow and a bit frustrating when you find that you can only go up one level after the long wait, as the rest is currently being restored.The tower (and Monastery) are closed on Mondays."

Most visitors will want to see all three. It was built between 1514 and 1520 as part of a defence system on the River Tagus to protect the approaches to the city. It is essentially a cross between something like a mediaeval keep and a more modern weapons platform. It is architecturally striking. It is ornate, highly adorned with carvings. Inside the tower is an Audience Room, the Governor\u2019s Room and a chapel but, even so, not a great deal to see. There are excellent views of the Tagus from the tower. The stairs steep and narrow so getting both up, and back down again, can take some time if there are a lot of people. Not suitable for people with mobility issues.Tip: Buy your tickets at the Mosteiro dos Jeronimos (if you are going there too) so as to save queuing."

It was built between 1514 and 1520 on the Island of Tajo River to defend the port entrance. Today, the chalk-white tower against blue sky is a beautiful site to photograph. Across the street, you will see Mosteiro dos Jeronimos. Do not miss it when you visit Lisbon."

Well, we did not visit the inside, I'd rather write it first so that no one reads this and feels disappointed. Instead, we took a taxi there (with 4 of us, it was interesting enough). We walked around the building which is really beautiful and we read about a few historical facts that are available in Portuguese, Spanish and English in various places around the tower. There is also a nice place to have a drink nearby, and you are within walking distance of Jeronimo Monastery."

Built in the 16th century it stands proud on the Tagus River with great views over the river and the city from the views at the top. It is not easy getting up and down the tower and there is a strange system for allowing crowds to go up and down as it is incredibly difficult to pass on the very narrow stairways which causes some confusion and frustration from some. The best way is to leave yourself plenty of time to see it all, be patient and go with the flow, remember it is sunny and warm!"

The tower has been used over the years for a Customs house, prison, lighthouse, and defense. We enjoyed going to the top, but must admit the crowd and queuing management was not very good. There is a queue at the first level that is controlled by a guard to get into a waiting room. Then another wait (20 mins) to ascend. Quick pics at the top and another queue to get down. We were glad we did this but would avoid if you are rushed."

Putting some money onto a card to pay for each trip is likely the most economical and practical options. When paying with the smart card, tickets are 1.25eur each, while tickets purchased from the driver are more expensive. Vending machines and sales counters can be found from the metro stations. The options of putting money onto the card is called \"Zapping\". Note, vending machines do not accept foreign credit cards. When putting money onto the card, the vending machines accept notes only, no joins (yes, it's, strange). Use the smart card inside the bus or tram to buy a ticket. Simple put the card in front of the card reader and wait until it shows a green light. The card reader also shows the remaining balance on the card. 2. Downtown to Tower of BelemTake tram 15E from Place Figueira / Rossio or Place Commercio to stop Pedrou\u00e7os. This stop is like 2 stops after the Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery. Walk down the street towards the sea, with the large compound of the Hotel Pal\u00e1cio do Governador to your left side. Then turn left for 50m to reach the pedestrian bridge to cross the railway line. The Tower of Belem can already be seen some 200m ahead.3. Return or continue to Padr\u00e3o dos DescobrimentosThere is a cafe with pleasant seating behind the tower, if you need a break. -Return the same way, or continue to the Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos. This sight is some 500m walk along the river banks, upstream (direction away from the open sea). Note, you can not walk along the shore line, but you need to circumvent the yacht harbour. From Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos return via the same pedestrian bridge, or continue parallel to the shore line up the Belem railway station where the next pedestrian bridge can be found. The latter bridge connects to Jardim Afonso and from there it is an easy walk to the Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery."

It's like a TARDIS it doesn't look that big from the outside. we went all the way to the top of the tower got some great photos from up there. But do be warned there is only one spiral staircase going all the way up and it does get crowded.so if your ever in Lisbon do visit Belem Tower you won't be disappointed"

The tower is several blocks from the Monsteiro so since we were in Belem early (and both attractions do not open to 10), we walked to the Tower first and stood in line. Despite there being no signs, you buy the tickets inside the tower. You\u2019re able to walk around inside the tower, but the main attraction is when you start climbing up to see different vantage points. At one point, there is a narrow spiral staircase (of 93 steps) to get to the very top. It\u2019s single file line to go up and down on the same staircase. I got a little claustrophobic, so I didn\u2019t go all the way to the top. After about two flights of stairs, there\u2019s a little platform where you can stop and see more views. There is a clock on each level that displays if you can go up or down the staircase during the next 3 minutes. This timer allows people to go up and down the staircase. Hence, why there is a limit to the number of people who can go the top of the tower. Which is why I was glad that we got there right when they opened b/c the lines could get long. I liked the Tower and the different views you can see. We bought the combo ticket at the Tower \u2013 which saved us time and money when we arrived at the Monsteiro."

We'd paid 12 euros each to tour the Cloister, which also included admission to the tower. The tower is a 10-15 minute walk from the monastary, through a park with benches, fountains and little old ladies selling inexpensive cork jewelry. We were sure glad we bought the Cloister tickets, because they also included admission to the tower. We by-passed 200-300 people waiting in cue for tickets!!`The tower itself was impressive and symbolic, as it was both a departure and welcoming home point for the great Portuguese explorers. Built in the 16th century, it has a commanding view west toward the Atlantic Ocean, as well as great views across and up the Rio Tejo. There are actually 3 sets of stairs, counting the set that leads down to what was most likely the powder room where they stored explosive charges. The next set of stairs lead up to the main view level of the tower, with a commanding 360 degree view of the surroundings, while the 3rd set leads up to the highest point of the tower. I'm sure glad we go to see it!"

Yes it's interesting and historic, but honestly, for the amount of time you may queue and even more if you want to go to the top of the tower, I genuinely didn't feel the wait was worth it. As Towers/ramparts or castles go, it's not aesthetically the most beautiful, the most interesting, the most significant or the most rewarding to explore, but overall, I'm glad I did it. It's ok if you've got an hour to kill in Belem, but I doubt you'll lose too much sleep if you don't get to see it, but that's just me."

There are two lines to get through in the little tower: the line for tickets and then to climb the narrow tower to the top. Here is what we did to save some time. We went to the Archeological Museum (right next to Jeronimos Monastery) ticket booth to purchase the combo ticket for Jeronimos Monastery and Tower of Belem. We went to Jeronimos Church ( free admission) and then Jeronimos Monastery. Both are beauties for pictures as long as the crowds are under control. Buying the tickets in advance saved us the 1 hour wait in the first line of Tower of Belem. After that, when you make it to the first level of the tower, hope for an overcast sky and bring patience (~45 min) as you wait to walk up the tower for views that are nice but not a must. After this we ate at Nune's, a awesome seafood restaurant between the Tower and the monastery."

As we passed the long line we thought we were golden until we got in line on the second floor of the tower (standing in the hot sun)...the red/green, stop/go arrows are completely ignored, so chaos is on every floor there after. There is little information about the tower and floors and its completely frustrating as people cut in line, ignoring the go/stop instructions. We were nearly 1 hour in the hot interior of the tower waiting to get to the top floor. Also annoying were people who shouldn't be attempting to climb the steps, slowly going up while those waiting, saw the green arrows turn red!

What we didn't know was that inside was a significantly longer queue to get up the tour. They let people go in in large groups as it's only single file on the staircase in the tower.this means you end up standing in the sunshine waiting for anywhere from 20 minutes upwards. We waited about half an hour in the end and would be lucky if we spent that time in the tower. Its a nice tower with a great view but not really worth the effort."

All is because there is a limit of people that can enter to each floor.( the total is about 4 hours). To shorten only the entrance time, you should buy a ticket in advance."

From the prison in the basement to the top of the tower, it offers a glimpse of the past. The view from the top is breathtaking, especially on a sunny day, but to reach it first you need to get through a very narrow (and I do mean narrow) spiral stairs with 93 steps, and you need to do it fast. The stair is so cramped that it has room for people to either go up or down but not both, therefore there are signals to tell you when you can go in which direction (traffic lights if you wish). It\u00b4s worth it though. Beware, the tower is not that big so there\u00b4s a limit to the number of visitor that can be inside at any given time, this can lead to long waiting times. If it\u00b4s sunny bring an umbrella or you will melt under the Mediterranean sun while queuing. Speaking of queues, it gets really long if you\u00b4re buying your ticket there. We bought our tickets at the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia (a combi ticket that also included the Jeronimos Monastery) and that saved us a lot of time."

The views of the port are impressive but can be seen almost as well from other locations in Belem. There was disappointingly little information provided with the various exhibits.

Once on the roof we spent about 30 seconds looking then started queueing to come back down. As soon as it went green we went down only to find several people were still coming up. This resulted in some people getting wedged in the stair case. We came back up then ran out as soon as we could. People were running in and out of the rooms to make sure they were out before it went red again. We heard one man saying 'let's get out of this place while we can'. I'm sure this could be improved."

We finally got inside and the first floor had recreated cannons and precious little else. We waited on a another line to get to the tower. After watching 50 people exit a small entrance on the second level we were able to go in. The staging area was packed and had a line around the perimeter. He ushered us into the middle of the room. We asked how would we get in and got no response. After an interminable wait in the hot, close room he announced we could begin he climb. We tried to join the line and were screamed at by the people on the perimeter who felt we were cutting. After a skirmish we left frustrated and angry. We tried to get it money back, but the ticket taker and other officials were not sympathetic. If you go early or off season it is a beautiful castle with we assume great views. But if the line goes 100 yards past the drawbridge, just take pictures. By the way, this was only time in Portugal where we felt indifference from staff. The Portuguese people are kind and accommodating by and large."

There is a system in place to both limit the numbers and control the flow of people. It doesn't work. You spend most of your time having to squeeze past people and wait in line to climb up or down the tower. Nice view at the top but really not worth the effort unless you visit out of season."

As soon as we reached the top we had to instantly join the queue to go back down as it filled the top of the tower - you couldn't take any pictures or enjoy the views due to the ridiculous queuing/staircase system which needs to be addressed.Prior to this, we very nearly didn't buy a ticket after enjoying the view from the outside and we definitely wish we hadn't wasted our money on a ticket - in fact we feel like we should have been paid to go through that terrible experience.

Do not visit the tower unless you are willing to queue for 3hrs.The queue system is non existent with those with pre-booked tickets and those without tickets in the same queue which lasts 1hr. This queue is on an exposed bridge in the sunshine. We decided to prepay for a ticket in the ticket office (the ticket office is crazily located in the tower which allows those who skip the queue to walk straight into the tower) and upon returning to the queue, as we did not want to skip, we were told that we could not enter the tower as we had already been in the tower (?!?) - this displays the lack of communication and organization in the tower. Finally, after entering the tower, we walked upstairs to climb the tower - we were then told to queue for 30mins to enter the secondary tower to climb the tower. This queue was in addition to the 1hr queue outside the tower. One staff member attempted to prevent visitors from climbing up the tower while her colleagues sat downstairs idle.After waiting in the tower, we were brought to the second floor. We waited for 30mins in an overcrowded room before deciding that we had decided to waste 2hrs of our lives in a queue without seeing anything. The tower is obviously beautiful from the exterior with an attractive first level but the tower is understaffed and terribly organized. The staff that are on site are rude and unhelpful.Have visited several unesco heritage sites but this has to be the most badly organized heritage site in the world. Definitely ruined my experience of the beautiful area of Belem. Please re-organize the ticketing system and queueing system as it will have a negative effect on the attraction."

People basically spend 1-2 hours waiting in the line at the entrance (even when you have prepaid tickets), then wait another hour on the first level for the stairs to be cleared and to climb upstairs. When you finally arrive at the top, you only find out that there is really nothing to see except for a bit of the view. However, the view is also nothing spectacular since such view can be captured at other city landmarks as well. Despite there is a sign saying that only 120 people are allowed in the tower at a time, the top was over crowded, which makes it impossible to take a decent picture. After several hours of standing still and waiting in the line, you basically walk away with nothing. So I wouldn't recommend to visit this place unless you really have nothing better to do."

The views from the top of the tower, of Lisbon and the river Tagus are spectacular, but be prepared to queue for a long time to get in. We queued for an hour outside the tower in baking hot sun, then there were two further shorter queues inside. Take some sun lotion, sun hats and water. There are no toilets on site. The queuing system does however mean that the tower is not too busy inside so you can enjoy your visit. The exterior of the tower is best viewed from the river. I got some good photos from a river cruise that passed the tower. Interesting factoid: there was a huge earthquake in Lisbon in 1755 which changed the course of the river Tagus so much that the tower ended up on the North side of the river when it had originally been built in the middle."

The Torre de Belem watches the entrance to Lisbon - the tower was built in the Manueline style on a small island in the Tagus River near the Lisbon shore in the beginning of the 16th century - as a part of the defense system of the river Tagus.It is fairly small and easily seen in short time - if only the queues and the overall design allowed it.The queues for entrance is quite often very long (count on more than one hour), and once inside there are queues for going up and down the tower - due to the extremely narrow staircase, where two people cannot pass in opposite directions.Tickets can be obtained on the web, but do still expect long queues.It is quite interesting to see the cramped and narrow quarters, where first the people manning the towers fortifications had to live - and later the use as a secure prison (mostly for political opponents of the current regents) after surrendering the tower to Spanish forces in 1580 - a usage that was effective until 1830.A good way to visit the Belem Tower is to take the tram 15 to the Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery, cross the road (there is a pedestrian underpassage by the end of the small park opposite the monestary) and then walk along the river. By taking this route, you'll also pass the Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos, the impressive monument raised to commemorate the golden age of the Portuguese explorations and discoveries.Going back you can take the tram 18 back from the small rotunda near the monastery (it's the old type of tram). Caf\u00e9s and restaurants are also abundant in this area."

If I were to go again would definitely investigate buying tickets online as there is a different line to get in pre booked and when we came out , there was a long queue to get in. There is a maximum number of people allowed in at one time. The tower itself is very impressive from the exterior. Inside is now empty but interesting . You follow a red/green light system to go up the spiral staircase and the view at the top is very pleasant."

A few other visitors had the same problem at the time. However, people who had got the combination ticket from the monastery were allowed in.

Belem Tower is a early 16th century building and UNESCO World Heritage attraction that we found to be the most interesting attraction in Belem during our recent visit to Lisbon. Opening Hours are 10am to 6:30pm during the summer period. Entry tickets are \u20ac6 or you can purchase combo tickets which include entrance to the Jeronimos Monastery (\u20ac12). There is a further combo ticket for (\u20ac25) that gives you further access to the Nacional Arqueologia, Entnologia and two Coches museums in Belem. The tower is a decorative fortification that is accessed by a footbridge. The exterior of the Belem Tower is particularly impressive featuring open balconies, battlements lined with rope carved adornments, Moorish style watchtowers and statue figures. It is nothing short of a fairytale-like structure that is a delight to see from the outside. Within Belem Tower, you have access to the ground floor as well as several rooms within the tower, which you can enter as you wind your way up the interior staircase. There is a large open area up one short flight of stairs and another at the top of the tower itself. The rooms you can visit are quite plain from the inside but include plenty of views to the outside world. There is a lovely arcaded logia on the second level room which overlooks the open space within the fortification and the sea. This is a particularly nice part of the tower to see and visit. Throughout your visit, you'll be clicking picture of the building, views of Belem and the sea. In the end, we very much enjoyed visit to Belem Tower. It is worth the entrance fee to experience this attraction. However, it is also rewarding just to see Belem Tower from the outside if you are short on time and don't wish to wait in the queue to enter. Note: Due to limited space and visitor capacity, entrance and visits can be slow going at times. Only certain number of people can be in the upstairs rooms of the tower at the same time. As such, there is some waiting around at times. This is something to consider if you are short on time for your visit to Belem."

It was free, no waiting and the dungeon was amazing after listening the interesting details as (when the tie was up, the prisoners had to stand here to breathe..), all the guns were there too. It was like traveling to the past. Now, it's so different. The store inside the tower, the modernized aspect, the traffic lights in the stairs (very narrow and a lot of climbing mind you), and the chance of taking good pictures without someone in the way... good luck with that. Nobody explains the first floor where you could whisper in a corner for another person on the opposite corner without the person in the middle of the room listening.. Cute details that tourists walk by with noticing.. Still, worth always a visit and imagine when you are on top, that from there,... many ships from the discoveries passed by.FREE every 1st Sunday of the month!"

It was built as a part of the defense system, but the architectural style is absolutely beautiful. You can buy the ticket along with Jeronimos monastery and save hours waiting in the queue at the tower. The 1st level terrace is spectacular and gives you great views of the city and the tower itself. The queues to go up on the higher level are really long and not worth the wait as the stairway going up is really narrow, you hardly get 2 minutes on the upper terrace when you manage to get here and I prefer the view from the 1st level."

When we left, there were people queuing for some time to get in, as the building only holds 120 so it's a system of one-out-one-in.The building is its own main attraction. There is some historical information in the various rooms, but basically it's the fabulous architecture and the views that are worth going for.

            "review": "Good view from the outside. The Torre de Belem is frequently recommended as a top attraction on most visitors lists to Lisbon and from the exterior it is worth visiting to take in the history and design of this structure. I chose to visit the monastery first as it was nearest to the bus stop and on entry you are given the option of a ticket to gain access to both the monastery and the tower. I would recommend this option as it allows you to avoid the long queues at the tower when you arrive. The tower itself is approximately a 15-20 minute walk from the monastery and provides you with a pleasant walk along the river front taking in the small harbours and restaurants that occupy the approach. If you approach from this direction you are greeted with a shot of the tower and the wooden bridge and queue waiting to gain entry. If you have brought your ticket in advance you can bypass the queue and go straight to the front.. This is not advertised or directed however close to the front of the queue there is a separation for ticket holders and those looking to purchase. On my visit the ticket holders queue was empty and when I joined this I was directed inside bypassing the queue of around 50 or 60 people. If you have a duel entry ticket walk past the waiting queue and go to the front.The inside of the tower is somewhat lacking, there are cannons inside the interior main level however no real description of the history or purpose of the tower. There is a small staircase that goes down to the lower levels and cells, there is no real description or detail as to the history or purpose of these cells, there are very low and require bending to get inside. I would personally bypass this as there are no views or reason to go down. Instead go up to the first level. Depressingly you will then find another queue to reach the top level. You can capture some nice shots of the first level and the structure itself from here. There are approximately 4 small observation towers you can sit inside momentarily to get a shot of the river and bridge. If you wish to go to the top level which seems like the only point for paying to go in you're then required to join the queue to go up the staircase.On the day of my visit there was an approximately 15-20 minute wait to get inside the tower first, then another 10 minute wait as the single circling staircase was emptied to get to the top. In my opinion this largely felt like an accident waiting to happen as they have installed some form of alert siren to let you know the stairs were in use but from the top this was largely being ignored. There is no suggestion here how to improve the building without major renovation work but whilst an employee was providing an element of queue control on the first level at the middle and top there was no one. The staircase was narrow and circular so you need to have good attrition and fitness to climb to the top.The views from the top were pleasant but not spectacular. You were afforded a view of the bridge and the river and the military museum close to the tower. And then began the process of joining the queue at the top to get down. My total visit to the tower was about an hour, half of which was in the queue to get to the top to get some pictures of the surrounding area. On leaving the tower you can walk around to the opposite side and get some better pictures without the bridge and queue of people. This I would recommend you to do. In summary if you want to visit this tower to capture that image used to advertise the attraction save yourself some money and time and just go around and take that picture. There is little to see inside and you will save yourself time from standing in a queue. If you have a joint entry ticket and you do want to go inside make sure you bypass the initial queue of people otherwise you will spend more time in a queue than feels necessary."

The waiting time is clearly signposted as 30-40 minutes before you even cross the bridge to the tower, and is a reasonable estimate, depending on when in the cycle you arrive. The historical information in the other parts of the tower is not much beyond what we learned at the monastery, and not worth a visit if you're not going to do the climb."

There are 2 levels up which you can visit, and one lower level (where the prisons were) The highest level has quite a bit of a wait as it's to go up, or down, 92 super narrow stairs to the highest level of the Torre de Belem. Once you are up there, the views are absolutely breathtaking. The lower level is also quite interesting to see. Overall, nice place to visit with the family. As for price, not sure how much it costs as it was free with our Lisboa Card. "

Then you are all marched up to the top together and must stay there until they say you can all come down together again. There were so many people that it was impossible to get anywhere close to the walls to enjoy the view. They also refused to give the American teenagers the student discount because they didn't have a student ID card like the Europeans have. Their passports were not good enough to prove their ages. When my husband explained that America does not have the same type of ID cards for students, the response was, \"you could be lying\". This is totally inappropriate and we will not take anyone there again. This is the same woman who last year have them the student discount!

Don't be surprised if you lose your breath walking up the spiral staircase to the top of the tower. The riverside walk from the monastery to the tower is also nice if the weather allows."

Its ornate fa\u00e7ade is adorned with fanciful maritime motifs - all carved out of stone. This area was packed with tourists, we actually fancied seeing inside the tower, but due to long queues at 10.30am we decided against it. There is a small fee, but only 120 people are allowed inside the tower at any one time, standing outside is still brilliant. Apparently if you climb steep spiral staircase to the top-floor tower terrace, you will rewarded with a fine panorama of the waterfront and the river.

But so far as queuing is concerned it can be somewhat frustrating. Firstly, everyone who has purchased a double entry ticket over at the Monastery has a speedy entrance lane which leaves all the other punters - like me, waiting ever longer at what feel like a non moving queue. Secondly only when you get inside do you get to find out that this first queue only gives you access to the first open level of terrace and one large ground floor room and a shrunken cellar - if you read the history you will have learned that a previous (baddie) owner used to keep his prisoners in the flooded cellars, hence the floors have been raised (concreted up to a non-flood level) this means a short visit to couple of rooms which you have to stoop to enter to see - basically nothing!! Thirdly, to get to the top of the tower there is yet another long queue, by this time frustration had taken over and I didn't bother with queuing again, even though it might be the first and last time I come to Lisbon - and I don't mean that in a negative way. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole 7 days, but there are other city breaks I am keen to experience, indeed, Lisbon has given me the confidence to believe that we can do more of these, it was brilliant."

If you do visit, there are multiple combination tickets you may find useful; I bought the ticket that included Jeronimos Monastery. It is included in the Lisbon Card, but you will still have to stand in line.....no cutsies!! The lines get long because the tower is small (and old!) and can only hold a certain number of visitors. They have to clear out a certain number before the next group is admitted, and the traffic flow is very confusing because the space is so small. I did not enjoy being herded like confused cattle.Its waterfront location meant Belem was vulnerable to sea attacks, so the area was fortified to serve the city\u2019s defense system. A large tower, Torre de Belem, was built in the Tagus River. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The tower was a fortress in the middle of the Tagus River at the time of its construction in the early 1500s, but the river has since receded, and today it lies barely offshore. It is nice to think about it probably seemed formidable centuries ago....but you do not need to go inside for that.I have a review of my day in Belem on my blog if you want to read more......link in my TripAdvisor profile."

If you already have a ticket you can skip the queue on the left and go straight in from the right. There is a timed entrance to the top of the tower and as such the queues can get rather long once even inside the tower. I most enjoyed the view of the tower from the outside so it's not really necessary to go inside because the view from the tower isn't really that impressive.

You then wait for that 120 to fully climb then return. Bizarre people management.Once you get to the top, you are really not that high, and you realise the only thing in the immediate area worth viewing is the tower itself!Then you have to wait for the rest of the 120 to finish ascending before you can go back down...If you really want to visit, make sure you have the prepaid ticket and stop at the first level.

The Monument to the Discoveries had a pretty short line, and an elevator that takes you almost to the top. We had to wait in line for about 30-minutes at the Bel\u00e9m Tower, and then found out we had to wait in another fairly long line to actually climb the tower itself. I believe they only allow 200 people in the tower at a time, so until someone leaves, no one else can go in. We didn't have the time to wait again, so we looked around the lower level and left.If you have a Lisboa Card, be aware that it does not allow you to skip the line at the tower. Their signs clearly state that you have to wait in the main ticket line with everyone else. If you don't have the card, you can buy a combo-ticket for the tower and the Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery, which will let you skip the line at whichever attraction you visit last. If you have a Lisboa Card, it does allow you to skip the line at the monastery, so we were able to walk right in when we went there.The Bel\u00e9m Tower is interesting, but if you only have the time or money for one, I'd recommend the Monument to the Discoveries. Either way, it's at least worth walking over to see the outside of the Bel\u00e9m Tower."

Unfortunately as a tourist attraction, it isn't worth the 6 Euros entry fee. Firstly, we had to queue nearly 20mins just to get in, although admittedly the line had shrunk by the time we left. The main outside area of the tower is quite nice to walk around and take a few photos. You can go downstairs and look at the prison cells but it isn't much to write home about. But then the main issue is the part where you can climb up a staircase to the top of the tower. There is only room for 120 people up the tower at any one time and because the staircase is so narrow, you can't have people walking up and down at the same time. So we waited 25 minutes downstairs until every single one of the 120 people in the group before had come down the stairs, before we could go up. And then when we went up, the view from the top turned out not to be really worth the wait. I totally understand why the management have to organise the system in this way, so I'm certainly not directing blame in their direction, but as a paying customer I'd say it's not worthwhile. Between arriving and leaving we were there for over an hour, and 45mins of that was spent queueing. My advice, take some photos from the outside, and then go and explore the rest of Belem."

We took a cab there but once in the square, we hopped on a Tuk Tuk for the tour of Belem. Please wear comfortable shoes and bring a light jacket. It is a little chilly in March. A must stop is Pasteis de Belem. Start your day off with great coffee and danish. After lunch, many places to eat, try Ginja D'Obidos. This is a sour cherry liqueur you must experience in Belem. Oh, by the way, take a couple of bottles back home with you to remember your visit. It was a great day in Belem."

When we did finally arrive by foot, there was a long line to get in and buy our tickets. Once past the entryway, you are diverted to a circular space with nothing other than a ring of small canons and a tiny gift shop. To actually get up into the tower, there was another long wait, after which you climb about 30 stairs to an open air space with a ring of tiny guard houses. But if you want to go further up, there is yet another, much longer line. Apparently, there are limits on the number of people who can go up to each level. Much to the consternation of people standing in line, large tour groups get to jump the line. You never do get to go to the top of the tower. This is not a rainy day activity as all the waiting is done outdoors. We went on a blustery, rainy day in May in the middle of the week. I'd hate to think of what it was like on a clear day in June or on a weekend. Of all the tourist attractions of Lisbon, this one could be skipped without missing much."

The attraction is also very badly organised with traffic lights to allow people to get up and down the only set of very steep and slippery stairs.

Also, if you travel out here by train, note that the Belem train station is quite a distance from the Torre. I'd say it's at least a mile walk. From the monastery, it's about a 10 minute walk. There is also a tram stop that is much closer to the Torre, the first stop after the monastery if you're on one of the trams/buses that go beyond the monastery (many do not)."

You really do not want to waste your life on that! Instead, take the local train (departs three times on hour) that follows the river bank. Less people, less hassle! Second tip: Make sure to include The Seafarers' mark (close to train platform), the Belem tower (get there early to beat the crowds), the monestary (or, at least, go sea the church and Vasco da Gama's monumental grave), and have your coffee break at the pastery-shop. Even if the waiting line for a table seems long, do not despare: With 400 tables, you'll quickly get a seat. The cakes are gooood and small enough to not being disgustingly sweet. Third tip: consider not commuting at all - in stead, rent a bicycle: If following the lane on the river bank, it is flat and no hills at all."

If you want to see a piece of history that is very close to Lisbon city centre then this a great place to visit on the weekend. The area is beautiful and there is a nice walking path along the river which is popular with the locals for running and walking on the weekends. You can really make a great day out of this visit as Belem itself is a must for anyone visiting Lisbon. Either before or after the tower and a nice walk you can visit Pasteis de Belem which is an amazing patisserie in Belem and has some of the best Portuguese tarts, pastries and biscuits you will find in Lisbon. Its very famous and popular so be preparted for a wait; however, there are plenty of seats and if you head straight to the back around all the bends you might get lucky and get a seat straight away. Overall you can really make a great day with a visit to this tower and Belem."

However, I would skip paying the entrance fee and just look at it from the outside. The interior is not that fascinating and the queue to get all the way to the top way too long. There is also hardly any information about the tower itself, its history etc. so I would simply admire it from the outside."

They are about a twenty minute stroll apart. It is also worth trying to time your visit as tour buses seem to arrive first thing (probably stopping in Belem on their way to Sintra) or later in the day (probably on the way back from a morning in Sintra). We were at the Torre de Belem at about 2.30 p.m. and there was no queue to get in but when we left about an hour later the queue stretched back about 30 yards or so. The Torre itself is fascinating in terms of architecture and worth seeing for that and because it seems to be a symbol of Lisbon. There is only one way up and down to the top of the Torre which means that a queue forms as staff let a certain number up for a few minutes before ushering them down again. This means that the top of the tower is very crowded for a few minutes - we waited until everyone else had been ushered down and then asked the staff member if he could take a photo of us which was great as we were obviously then the only ones there. The view over the esplanade and up to the Padrao dos Descobrimentos monument is also worth it as is the stroll back up the esplanade into Belem after the visit."

They are very close. I prefered the Padrao view, and most of my collegues agreed. But I liked Torre stone just a bit more in the inside. In my opinion I would choose only the Padrao next time."

Locals have told me there is nothing to see inside, nada de nada.I've been there 4 times and everytime I've just enjoyed the outdoors. The tower is a magnificent piece of Manuelino architectural design and the area around it is absolutely lovely. We even had a picnic there, the cafeteria next to it is cheap and the coffee is very good. So I would say it is a must see if you are in Lisbon, just don't bother with the inside and enjoy the sun over the Tagus River."

From what I understand, this was first built as a fortress to protect the habor and was one of the last thing that sailor saw on leaving. One can buy a single ticket for 6Euros or combined tickets to see 2 or 3 monuments for a bit more. There is of course, the Lisboa Card, which allows one to travel on the bus, tram and to visit many monuments and museums. If you have the time this is a good deal. This attraction is free on the first Sunday of each month. We came in to Lisbon on a cruise ship so we have to travel in to Belem. Here are some directions and an inexpensive way to get to Belem.We docked in Lisbon at Santa Apolonia terminal. This is over an hour's tram/bus ride to Belem. However, it is very easy to get there by bus/tram or train. So, exit the Port, go left and walk along the waters edge until you get to Praca de Comercio Square, one of Lisbon's main square. The square is on your right. Praca de Comercio is also called Terreiro do Paco. It is about an 8-10 min walk. It is a stopping point for buses and trams etc.Look for the stop for Tram #15E, should be ahead to the left. We paid 2.85Euros each way per person. You can buy the ticket on the Tram from the machine, which takes coins and notes. The machine gives change. Or you can buy it at a Metro station before you get on the Tram. The 15E to Belem would say \"ALGES\" because that is the last stop, but Belem is before this, about the 14th stop. The tram stops right in front of the Monastery, so you will know when you are in Belem. This is yet another attraction to visit. The church at the side is free to enter. You can also take Bus #728, which I think is about 2 streets over in front of Apolonia cruise terminal. \\ Look for the 728 going in the same direction you would have to walk to get to the square. If you take the bus you just sit on it until it arrives in Belem. It would also pick up passengers on its way at Praca de Comercio Square.On the way back we took Bus # 728, across the street from the Monastery. The cost was less than the Tram...1.80Euros each. You can buy on the bus. We got off at Praca de Comercio and walked around to see Lisbon's city centre. It takes a different route, passing the the Alcantara Mar & Cais Sodre Train station. We saw different things on the way back. If you walk up the Main street by the Square you can get to Rossio Train Station where you can get Trains to Sintra to see the Beautiful Palace."

Once inside though, there was little to see, a Jail/ Dungeon and the entry level with some cannons and brief information, then the first level of the Torre, - nothing there except another queue to go into the main tower. So we queued again - this time for about 30 mins before we were granted access to the narrow spiral staircase - single file only - and climbed to the top. Could be rather claustrophobic for some. Once at the top - a quick look at the view and.. you've guessed it , another queue to get down. In my view a complete waste of time and money. I will not be going back, the whole experience wasted almost 2 hours of our short weekend away. And this was March - hardly high season."

Its a nice tower but to get to the top you need to wait in line for 15-20 minutes on the first level so they can get 120 people up to the top and back down again.Once you leave to the outside court yard you go inside where you wait again and then you start your ascent up 90-something stairs in a circular tower.... Not for the physically challenged or those who are squeemish about enclosed spaces. You get to go up to the top, and all the floors in between, when going down. Its 6 euro but is cheaper when you buy the Jeronimos Monastery combo ticket with it. The front of the tower is impressive with the water rolling in under the bridge. The basement is not impressive and is fairly low in height. The entrance level has the cannons and the first level is nice to walk around. You can get to the tower using tram 15 and walking about 10 minutes from the tram, to the overhead walking bridge (more stairs) and then to the tower.Its probably a 15 minute walk from the monastery which I recommend you take the river-walk that is across the street(twice - one is an underground walkway to get across) from the monastery to get to the Tower. Using that path you get to see the discovery edifice on your way to the Tower."

There was just a short ish queue at the entrance so we decided to go in. Once inside we had to queue again to go up the tower and this was quite a long wait as they limit the numbers at the top. The staircase is very narrow so probably a health and safety issue - although not sure that any of that is an issue in Portugal! Anyway we went up looked at the view - watched people take endless gurning selfies of themselves then came down. It was pleasant enough but I would say not to bother really if the outside queue is long. There is not much in the way of written information inside and apart from a view up and down the river little else to warrant long queues.

            "review": "A pearl of the Manueline style. In the late 15th century, King John II had designed a defence system for the mouth of the Tagus that depended on the fortresses of Cascais and S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o (or Torre Velha) in Caparica on the south side of the river. These fortresses did not completely protect the river's mouth, and further protection was required. In his \"Chronicle of John II\" (Chronica de D. Joao II), which appeared in 1545, the author Garcia de Resende affirmed the king's opinion that the defences of Lisbon were inadequate, and that he had insisted on building fortifications along the entrance to the River Tagus to supplement the existing defences. To this end, he ordered the \"making of a strong fort\", but died before any plans were drawn. King Manuel I of Portugal revisited the proposal twenty years later and ordered the construction of a military fortification on the northern margin of the Tagus at Bel\u00e9m. In 1513, Louren\u00e7o Fernandes wrote a letter to his friends referring to the king's intention of constructing a tower near Restelo Velho, having determined it to be essential.The project was started on an outcropping of basaltic rocks situated a short distance from the river bank, using some of the stones being collected to build the Monastery of Santa Maria de Bel\u00e9m. The tower was designed by military architect Francisco de Arruda, named \"Master of the works of the Bel\u00e9m stronghold\" by King Manuel, and by 1516 he began receiving 763 blocks and 504 stones for its construction, delivered by Diogo Rodrigues, treasurer for the project. As construction progressed, a man-of-war called the Grande Nau (Great Ship), a heavily armed, 1000 tonne (1100 ton) ship continued to guard the estuary at the mouth of the Tagus until the fort's completion.The building was finished in 1519, just two years before Manuel's death, and Gaspar de Paiva was temporarily stationed to command the fortress; his commission was made permanent on 15 September 1521, when he was appointed the first Captain-General, or alcalde, and the fortress was named the Castle of St. Vincent (Castelo de S\u00e3o Vicente de Bel\u00e9m), in honour of the patron saint of Lisbon.King Miguel I (1828\u20131834) used the dungeons to imprison his liberal opponents,[1] while another level was used as a custom house for ships until the duty on foreign ships was abolished in 1833. The tower received military upgrades in 1589 and 1809\u201314.During the reign of Maria II, Almeida Garrett protested the site's degradation and under the persuasion of the Duke of Terceira, renovations were begun by military engineer Ant\u00f3nio de Azevedo e Cunha. He demolished the Philippine barracks and extended revivalist elements in 1845\u20131846 (such as the armoured merlons, the balustrade of the veranda along the southern fa\u00e7ade, the laced fascia in the cloister and the niche with an image of the Virgin and Child).In 1865\u20131867 a beacon was installed on the south-east terrace of the building and a telegraph service was started, while nearby a gas factory was built, producing smoke that aroused many protests. The first moves to preserve and rehabilitate the tower began in the latter part of the 20th century. First, the tower was transferred to the Ministry of Finance in 1940, which undertook small conservation works. Then the military quarters on the battlements were removed and the inner cloister was built. The architectural landscape designer Ant\u00f3nio Viana Barreto began a three-year project in 1953 to integrate the tower with the local shoreline. In 1983 the site hosted the 17th European Exhibition on Art, Science and Culture, and various projects involving the building were undertaken, among them covering the cloister with a transparent plastic cupola. In the same year the Bel\u00e9m Tower was classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.In the 1990s, the property was transferred to the Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Patrim\u00f3nio Arquitect\u00f3nico (forerunner of IGESPAR), which began a full restoration of the building that lasted from February 1997 to January 1998; this included reinforcing the tower and bastion, reinforcing the south balcony supports with stainless steel rods and epoxy resin, treating the mortar joints, and general structural cleaning. The statues of Saint Vincent of Saragossa and the Archangel Michael received the same treatment. In 1999 the project received the Europa Nostra award for its restoration of the exterior. The Bel\u00e9m Tower was added on 7 July 2007 to the registry of the Seven Wonders of Portugal.The Bel\u00e9m Tower is situated on the northern bank of the Tagus River in the civil parish of Santa Maria de Bel\u00e9m, municipality of Lisbon, accessible at the western end of the Avenida de Bras\u00edlia by a small bridge. Nearby are the Jeronimos Monastery to the east and Fort Bom Sucesso {Forte do Bom Sucesso} to the west), while to the north are the tower Governor's residence, the old Governor's residence for the Bom Successo fort, and the Chapel of S\u00e3o Jer\u00f3nimo.The tower is isolated along the riverbank, between the dock of Bom Sucesso and Pedrou\u00e7os, on a basaltic outcropping of rocks belonging to the geomorphological Volcanic Complex of Lisboa-Mafra. Although various guides have claimed that the tower was built in the middle of the Tagus, and now sits near the shore after the 1755 earthquake redirected the river, they are incorrect. The Portuguese Ministry of Culture (Minist\u00e9rio da Cultura) and the Institute of Architectural Heritage indicate that the tower was constructed on a small island near the bank of the Tagus, opposite the shore of Restelo. As development extended the shoreline progressively, more and more of the northern bank crept southwards into the Tagus, the tower becoming integrated into the riverbank over time.The Bel\u00e9m Tower was built from a beige-white limestone local to the Lisbon area and thereabouts called lioz. The building is divided into two parts: the bastion and the four story tower located on the north side of the bastion.The 16th-century tower is considered one of the principal works of the Portuguese Late Gothic Manueline style. This is especially apparent in its elaborate rib vaulting, crosses of the Order of Christ, armillary spheres and twisted rope, common to the nautically-inspired organic Manueline style."

We joined the queue at the start of the wooden bridge and it took 45 minutes to reach the ticket office, only to find it's now free only on the first Sunday of each month. After looking at views from the first level we had to queue again for 15 minutes for the climb up the narrow spiral staircase to the top, and were given no time to stop off on intermediate levels, either on the way up or down.Historically important, but the views are better from the taller modern monument nearby, which has a lift!"

A couple of things to be aware of, one I guess as it was a Sunday, there were quite long queues. We had pre-paid, which did help with the initial entry. However, to get up the tower itself there is another queue as there is a restriction of 120 people at a time allowed to go up. We weren't in a hurry and didn't mind. Just factor it into the time you have. The other point is there are some 93 steps on a narrow spiral staircase to negotiate, which left many, me included, rather breathless. Worth the effort for the views, but if you have any issues with vertigo or claustrophobia, I'd say give it a miss. Otherwise as we did, enjoy."

One big thing: If you have a Lisboa pass and head to the Belem area, make sure to get tickets to all area attractions at your first stop. Then you can pass the lines and go straight in. We waited in line at the Torre de Belem for about 45 minutes. Once we got in, there were more lines to get to the third floor. It's definitely worth visiting if the line isn't too long.If I had to do it again, I would go to the attraction with the smallest line, get my tickets to all three sites, and then go from there."

Lots of narrow, narrow stairs that only allow one way passage and is controlled by lights and staff. It took some nerve to go out to the upper battlements and it gives a bit of a rush but not for the faint of heart. It was under repair in some areas but it didn't stop the flow.

One of the main landmarks of Portugal's maritime history, built in 1495 by King Manuel who was an important international trader, as Vasco da Gama and later Alvares Cabral established sea routes to India, Goa and Malacca, Africa and Brazil, bringing and offering exotic products. These experiences and knowledge lead to the definition of the Manueline style characteristics, represented in monuments he built in Portugal byKing Manuel I, between 1495 and 1521. The Tower of St Vincent is an example of transition from military architecture of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the mass of a recessed square tower of medieval character, with about thirty meters high, an advanced body of \"foundation\" and base, strengthening horizontal and embracing the irregular hexagonal shape, forty meters long, oriented and south of the Tagus, in order disarm with their fire batteries placed on the bulwark any attempt to assault by sea."

There is a very narrow, winding staircase up to the top. But, be warned, it takes time as it is one-way only, so visitors are organised by a system of bells and green and red lights which makes it impossible to climb it without a series of stops along the ascent and descent."

It is extremely attractive but after 10 minutes of photos and admiration,attention wanders to other sights and you feel it is time to move on. Also the tours there give you the feel of a 'herd' mentality-maybe it would have been better to catch a bus and just wander around myself. It is more out-of- the-way than attractions round the old city."

I was very excited about seeing this historical site, and had been told by numerous people it was one of the top 3 things to see in Lisbon. While it is visually stunning and serene and beautiful to observe, I would highly recommend not paying to enter the facility. The place is not very big and what you will find is that there is not necessarily much to learn or discover, except that you're getting views that are a bit higher than what you have on the ground floor/around the structure. For a 'top 3' tourist attraction I expected more than just a good place to rest my feet and hang out as if it were a park (which seemed to be what most people were doing nearby).I will say that the area nearby closer to the monastery was very nice, cool shops and restaurants and public buses get you downtown very quickly."

A World Heritage site, situated in the suberb of Belem a few miles out of Lisbon central it is easily accessed by tram 15 which runs along the riverside, as well as buses, taxis and tuktuks. Be aware however that the trams can become very overloaded at peak times and will not always stop.The tower is built where the Atlantic Ocean begins to have a noticeable effect on the river with waves splashing around and sometimes over the short wooden causeway which accesses it.Reasonable access charge, after first looking around the cellar gunpowder storage and cells and the living accommodation above before you access the tower.The tower is climbed and descended by the same 93 narrow steps on a spiral stairway so each step is a foot width on the outside with nothing on the inside. Definitely worth bringing along a small hand torch because there is no lighting apart from limited daylight and no handrail. There is a one way system which is supposed to ensure visitors are only traveling one direction but it doesn't work too well.I would have liked to have seen more information boards about the tower. Don't be put off by my description of the climb but it is not for the infirm and care would have to be taken with small children.Belem is the cultural area of Lisbon with a fine church, museums housed in what was a huge monestry and concert venues."

The Torre de Bel\u00e9m is a quirky, interesting piece of Maneuline architecture: the positives are the excellent views across the Tagus both east towards the 25 April bridge / Cristo Rei statue / Discovery monument, and out towards the open sea (even in poor weather conditions). The negatives are a) the thronging crowds, and b) the near complete absence of any historical illustrative/explanatory material on the site: combined with the absence of any reconstruction (furniture, dress, etc.) this means you have to do your homework in advance. NB: access to both the lower level and upper levels is not disable-friendly (also, the lower prison level is only about 1.75m high) as narrow winding staircases provide the only access to either. Undoubtedly a great tourist point, but the city council could do a *lot* more with this. The access price is \u20ac6/adult, and while it's nice to get a view from the tower, you're not really missing much if you skip entry and spend the \u20ac on a hearty main course at one of the restaurants nearby (be careful & check the menus posted outside restaurants: some places charge \u20ac12 for a main, while others half that - even if you don't speak Portuguese, don't be afraid to go in to the less posh places, they are friendly, cheap, and the food is good!)."

It's a very well organised attraction but if you have an issue climbing stairs, maybe avoid the top of the tower as there is a climb of almost 100 steps to the top. But it is a view that is well worth the climb. The price of the attraction was reasonable and the waiting time was not long at all. Next door lies the museum of combat and the view of this modern building from the top of this ancient building gives great insight into the range of tourism that lisbon has to offer!"

A superbly decorated tower built in the early C16th as part of the defences of the Tagus (and therefore contemporary with Henry VIII's Deal and Walmer Castles) it has been much altered from its original considerably more dour appearance. Used as dungeons and barracks as well as a defensive work, it is an extremely attractive element to the waterfront. Access to the upper floors is via a single spiral staircase, access to which is controlled by a buzzer and traffic lights. The climb to the top in a single 'trip' will get the visitor's heart rate going! The rooms inside are very splendid even if the original decorations are now gone, but the main gun deck does give the feel of what it would have been like in Renaissance times."

The history of this city can only be expanded through the minds of the guides who grew up with their culture. The Torre was just a part of the tour the Diago provided. Let yourself go of the crowds and experience the intimacy that a private tour can provide. Sintra Majik Private Tours offered this experience and much more, give them a try and you won't be disappointed."

It is cheaper if u carry proof of age for students. Although we didn't carry ID x our tens, we were charged less. Very well worth the line @ Torre de Belem.

We first tried to visit the Torre de Belem at about 1100 hrs on a day in November, but the queue stretched out of the tower and down the wooden entrance walkway, almost to dry land. We estimated we would have had to wait perhaps 20 - 30 minutes, so broke off and went to sample the custard tarts at Pasteis de Belem instead: (a good decision - they were delicious). We next visited the tower in the late afternoon, at about 1600 hrs (the tower closes at 1730 hrs in winter) and were able to walk straight in - so the advice is to leave your visit here to after lunch, as it is likely to be much quieter than early in the day. Inside, the biggest area is the lower battery, where some artillery pieces are placed at the gun ports to suggest how it may have looked in the 16th century. Interestingly, the cannons on display are breach loading, rather than muzzle loading. If you wish you can descend the steps into the dungeon/storage area but the headroom is severely restricted and there is nothing to see, so this part of the tower can be omitted from the visit. Going up the narrow staircase (controlled by a traffic light system), leads to a series of open rooms, each occupying the whole floor area, with information panels giving details of their original use. Emerging onto the roof gives a great view of the river Tagus and the 25 de Abril bridge. Apart from the lower battery, access to the upper areas is difficult and so this is not a good place for those with mobility problems. Similarly, very young children might find it difficult to get around. We spent a little over an hour exploring; history buffs might want to stay longer, casual visitors might need less time. Finally, the tower makes a good subject for photography, either early in the morning, or late in the evening, at sunset. We used public transport - tram 15E - to get to Belem (the map of the line inside the tram itself shows the best stop for the tower). Bear in mind that there is a multi-lane highway to be crossed before being able to get to the tower and its surrounding park (Jardim da Torre de Belem), so after alighting from the tram head for the river and after arriving at the big highway (Av. da India) look out for the footbridge which is easily spotted.One last point - we used the Lisbon card for our visit, and their website proudly boasts that it gives: \"Priority access at Lisbon\u00b4s most popular attractions.\" Well it doesn't at the Torre de Belem! You have to queue with all the other visitors!"

The grounds are a mix of cheap vendor booths, pickpockets, and bad restaurants, so pack accordingly, watch your pockets, and plan on eating elsewhere. Uber's 10 Euros. Its also walkable from the Maritime museum, the Mosteiro de Jeronimos, and the Barnardo collection, so plan your day in Belem. Better restaurants lie further into Belem ."

We visited the city on Saturday, so there was a street fair where we bought some nice bracelet and necklace made out of Portuguese cork.We had lunch at restaurant Queijadas de Belem where we ordered very fresh pasteis de bacalhau, we ate a very tasty Bacalhau with potatoes and finished our meal with the delicious and very crunchy pasteis de Belem with coffee.It was a nice break before finishing our Belem tour and get ready to come back to the hotel at the end of the day.Nice sunny day, temperature around 15 Celsius, it was for sure one of our best day in Portugal."

This highly decorative, manueline style stone tower with Moorish touches was constructed approximately 500 years ago for a very practical reason: defense of the Tagus River estuary. The Torre de Belem and the Jeronimos Monastery together are considered as the complex of Belem, a World Heritage Site. This location is definitely worth a visit.Apparently the Tower was built on a small island in the river, but with the shifting of the river, it's now on the riverbank. You enter the tower by means of a walkway so you can enter when the river is up and water actually surrounds the tower. You can go into the stone guardhouses and imagine yourself many centuries ago on the lookout for enemies invading the river, and you can go below and see the cannon positioned for firing at ships daring to breach this entry into the port of Lisbon. I liked the aspect of being able to see beyond all of the carved stone decorations of the past to contrast with aspects of the present, such down the river (like cruise ships) or across on the opposite shore or to the April 25th bridge.This tower was used for various purposes once its days as a part of a defense system were over. There is a lower area that was apparently once used as a jail, and it consists of empty arched rooms with low ceilings, leaving me to wonder if all the prisoners were very short or if being made to stand stooped over was a part of their punishment...."

A ship comes in through the channel and both sides bombard it with \"skipping\" cannon balls, bam, end of threat. The waters have come, making it more of an island fort, and receded, like now, with a huge semi-circular set of steps-seats going well into the water. Under the plank walkway to get into the tower you can still see stairs from an earlier era. Each level has its own beauty and views. The 93 steps are broken up into the four levels so it isn't a full on press. Each floor had a purpose. The top floor was the chapel, next down was the audience chamber for gatherings, below that the King's quarters, below that the Governor's chambers then the upper and lower batteries. The defensive fortifications are really ingenious and entirely effective. What a great piece of history. The one quirk is the signal system letting people know if up coming people have the right of way or down going. It shows the minutes until change but some folks just don't pay attention and it messes things up causing some frustration. If you don't want to pay to go in there is a model in bronze outside which is a nice representation."

It costs about 6 Euros to go inside and is not accessible to those with mobility issues. There is not a great deal within the tower, but there are some excellent views from the outside areas at the top. There are public toilets nearby, which are clearly signposted.*Caution. ----- Beware of the ladies selling scarves and the like.

More annoying still was the lack of information provided on the history of the tower.

No one followed it, so it was just chaos. People pushing, yelling, and getting frustrated at each other.

We waited - bracing ourselves against biting winds alternating with mild showers - to go in. What made this wait of over two hours unbearable was the fact that tour groups were allowed to go in ahead of us! Why? Because they have a ticket. Well, we'll have a ticket too, once you allow us to reach the ticket window, which is the near the entryway, which you can only get to after standing in the stupid queue. And they allow only 120 people in at a time, so the queue moved at snail's pace - each of the four tour groups that was allowed to skip the queue added 15 minutes to our wait time. The staff were absolutely unsympathetic. Why cant tour groups join the same queue? After all, we're all paying the same money to get in. If there is a pre-booking option, it should be open to everyone.The staff just kept shrugging and saying, everyday is same. What's that even supposed to mean? Several people gave up and left the queue. For the more patient ones who braved it out and went in, the tower itself was a disappointment- empty and offering some views of the sea. But if it is views you are craving, you are better off at one of the city's many Miraduoros - free, in abundance, and with no rude staff to contend with!PS - If Portugal really wants tourists, they need to work on the staff, the attractiosn, and importantly, the tickets. The ones we were handed looked like supermarket receipts.Put a picture, put the amount, make it memorable, not nightmarish."

Go up into the tower, and enjoy the view from top. The windy stair case (believe it said 93 steps) has several floors along the way. But it is extremely narrow passage (one direction at a time - cant safely do two columns of people at once) and very tight radius circle. Had a nice system that told you when to ascend and descend from the various floors to keep the traffic on stairs moving and safe. Except most people tried to ignore it making it a bit more time consuming. But worth the stop and price."

Also the stairs are very narrow allowing a person at a time. While there is a green/red light people don't respect it. It takes half an hour just to get up an down. My advice, go there, take a picture with the tower as the landscape is beautiful than head to the monument if you want the views."

We bought a joint ticket to the tower with the Mosteiro dos Jeronimos - I would recommend doing this if you intend to visit both as it saves some money and, more importantly, time queuing. Even better, book your ticket online before visiting to save queuing for a ticket all. After the monastery, we found the tower a little anti-climatic. It was nice enough to take a look at but maybe not worth the money to go in. We did enjoy the view from the top of the tower but there was a very silly and inefficient queuing system that prevented you from exploring at your own pace. Unless you're certain that you want to go inside, I would just take a stroll round and look from the outside."

What will make your visit to Torre de Belem even more disappointing is if you try to climb the very top of it. Loooong queue to get up and loooong queue to get down. Views from the top are so boring that you'll wish to go down in 10 sec but you'll be stuck up there for much longer.So instead of paying to get in buy yourself a cold drink or an ice cream in beautiful park in front of Torre de Belem and enjoy the views!P.S. it's even more beautiful at night.

Another massive queue rapped right around the terrace and zig zagged several times to get back down. We joined the queue more or less straight away. I wanted to get out. People at this stage were getting angry, I witnessed a number of exchanges due to atmosphere. there were no staff up top to assist / put order (people were skipping the queues, others going against the traffic light system up and down causing more delays).

When, presumably greed, persuades organisers to allow far more than that number into the tower, you inevitably end up with 2-3 hundred visitors understandably irritated at having to be badly herded like sheep through a system not ever designed to cope with such numbers.

If you NEED to see the inside of this place you need to buy your tickets ahead of time to avoid the long line waiting to purchase tickets (in the hot sun), or GO EARLY as the tourist attractions are virtually empty when they first open. Most attractions get annoyingly crowded later in the day. The tower is very cool from the outside so go take pics of it, but ONLY GO IN if you want to wait in long lines once you are in to see the views from the tower. We had seen better views from Alfama so were unimpressed with the amount of time and waiting it takes , just for a river view. The stairs inside the tower only accommodate one way foot traffic so once you FINALLY make it to the top tower from waiting in lines, you have to WAIT in a huge line in the hot sun, to come back down. We hated the experience and have nicknamed this place the tower of terror after a Disneyworld attraction. Be warned."

For safety reasons, only a certain number of people are allowed in at any given time. If you can, purchase your tickets ahead of time; you won't have to wait long in a queue to get in. There are combo tickets with other museums (the Monastery, for example). Another option is the Lisboa card, which gets you into the Torre for free (but you'll have to wait in the ticket queue).The views across the river are quite nice, and with the bridge in the background, you can get some nice photos. I wanted to go up higher in the tower, but the queue to go up above the second level was too long, and I was pressed for time. Perhaps earlier in the day it would be better.The admission is not expensive for a nice piece of history, and with a combo ticket or Lisboa card it's even less expensive.There is a nice park adjacent to the Torre, too, with some shade trees."

Can't make two steps without someone pushing an unwanted item into your face... Hope this will be solved and then it's a perfect visit."

I recommend buying your ticket at the Museum adjoining the Monastery . . you can buy a 3-way combo ticket that lets you skip the entry lines at both the tower and (breathtaking) monastery (which are usually both VERY long), and see the museum as well. Also, consider visiting at sunset (see photo) - amazing light and no crowds. Do not skip Belem is you visit Lisbon."

I am happy we did since the line to get in would have been an hour if we bought tickets there. We were able to walk past everyone waiting in the sun and heat. The history of the tower and its sister towers was really interesting. Great views from many different levels. Since the stairs are very narrow they have a \"traffic\" light system for going up and down. It can be a nightmare if arrogant jerks ignore the light and decide to go the wrong direction anyway. Price is very affordable. "

This is a popular tourist attraction in Lisboa, and for good reason as it is representative of a time when Portugal was a great maritime power. When the tower/ fortress was built in the early 16th century it was in the middle of the Targus Riiver. Since then so much land has been reclaimed it sits next to the shoreline. The building features some fine Manueline architectural detail and views along the riverfront, though there is not a lot to see inside the tower. When we visited we had to queue some time in the hot sun. Those who had pre-purchased their tickets skipped straight past. There is also some queuing involved to get to the top of the tower, though it is not too onerous."

It is always fairly busy with visitors, but is worth visiting. To get right up to the highest point there is a fairly small spiral stone staircase which has stop/go lights to let you know when people are either walking up or down, so when there are plenty of tourists it can take a fair while getting up to the top and then back down."

Passing by via train on Saturday, though, I could see a line to get in.TIP: Belem can be a long ride by bus/tram from downtown, so it makes sense to visit the major attractions in one shot.

The stairs are so narrow that groups can only either go up or go down and they have this system of lights telling you when it is safe to go down and when it is safe to go up. It seems like everyone completely ignores this system, and so there is a traffic jam of people trying to go up and down. This gets to be a little annoying, but its definitely worth it!

Please know that the main street where the Tram 15 runs is NOT on the water, thus you cannot see the tower from the tram track (or in our case, sidewalk). There is a overpass walkway to take you over but you have to cut down a side street.I personally will NOT suggest you to pay just to see the inside of the tower. While interesting and noteworthy as a tourist attraction, there is not much to see. However, if you have Lisbon Card, or does not mind paying extra \u20ac2 as a duel ticket with the monastery, go ahead. The view is good, you get a clear shoot of the Ponte 25 de Abril bridge (aka the \"Golden Gate Bridge\") - but as a tour guide said: You're in Lisbon, you don't have to pay for a view.TIPS: there is system to the 1 stairway madness (yes, it's a single spiral stairway that take you up to the top, then down to exit). Look for the arrow indicator above the entry way on each level. When the UP arrow turns green, you can walk up. When time is about to run out, you will hear an alarm. That means you need to get out of the way for the down traffic as soon as you can = get off the stairs into the nearest level. Then the DOWN arrow will turn green, so that people can get the heck out of there. It alternates and it's a good system if everyone understands and follows it.WARNING: because no one explains the system when you walk in, most visitors don't know about the arrow system. You will find yourself in queue forever trying to get down from the top. PLEASE share the info so that everyone can get in & out quicker."

Torre de Belem is a great destination to visit - allow about two hours, it is in a park along the river and there are other things to see and do as well. This tower is well preserved and visitors are permitted to go all the way up to the turrets, and down to the dungeons. One of a few buildings not destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, due to the fact that it was in the middle of the river (at that time, now along the shore) and was an earthquake-resistant structure due to riverbed. We had a very short line the day we visited and as a result it was not over crowded as it might be on a weekend. Views from anywhere in the tower are awesome, and visibility is quite good. The \"Golden Gate Bridge\" knock off can be seen from this venue, spanning the river. There is a snack bar for a coffee or light meal in the park area. Two caveats: #1 pay to use the public toilets - nominal fee goes toward upkeep #2 spiral staircases (to top of tower and to dungeons) may be a challenge for someone who is unsteady on their feet or gets dizzy easily."

The only downside beside our ca. 45 min wait to get into the Torre was the jammed stairway. You get a signal at the top or the bottom of the staircase when to walk. For some reason it got jammed and even though we had the green light to walk the staircase was jammed and the light got red again. Some people got frustrated. I would suggest that once you start your ascend go all the way to the top. Then visit the different floor while descending or vice versa. The big monument about Portugal as a seafaring nation is close to the Torre. In front of the monument is a huge world map on the ground. You can learn which nation occupied another nation and at what time.I found it quite interesting."

Nobody at the Jeronimo Monastery, which we had just left (and very much enjoyed) told us that there was the option to buy tickets for both attractions at once. There was absolutely no information about the tower - with daily queues like this, one would have thought that this would have been an ideal place to put up posters telling us what we needed to know about this very important piece of Portuguese history. Neither was there much information once we staggered across the threshold. It was very crowded, very small, and there was general chaos about who was supposed to go up and down the narrow stairs when. If you suffer from claustrophobia, be warned - this is not for you.

Unfortunately too many people ignore this so the ensuing traffic jam and arguments carried out in about a dozen different languages is good fun to watch in itself-as long as you are not directly involved.

The views from the top are grand, yet if you already have, or plan to, access the top of the nearby Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos (discovery monument) I wouldn't bother standing in a queue or paying for a ticket to go inside."

Take time to read about the history of the tower. We took a regular city bus (#714). from central Lisbon near our hotel all the way to the \"Discoveries\". monument for only 1.40 euros each way if you charge the Lisbon bus card. The tram runs the same route , but for twice the cost & is much slower. Also one saves several euros if you buy combined Belem tower and Jeronomo Monastery admission tickets instead of buying each separately at each entrance."

We thoroughly enjoyed seeing the torre from the outside, but were deterred by the line of people going inside and our assumption that it wasn't worth the euros to enter. Instead, we enjoyed its visual presence on the water and went to see the sailors' monument down the seawall and enjoyed a waterfront patio beer in between the sites. It is indeed iconic, but in terms of towers, castles and palaces, the 20 euros we paid to see the two sites in Sintra provided much greater bang for the buck...but again, we didn't enter... so I defer to others if they can provide a better review of why it's worth the entrance."

Through the trees I could see something lit up all gorgeous near the water and began to tell my group, \"Hey, wait up guys, I want to check out this monument!\" And then I realized that it was the tower. It was smaller than I thought it would be. Regardless, we walked all this way, so we went up to check it out. The tower is very beautiful, especially at night all lit up against the dark backdrop of the water. The park is quiet and pretty, and as it were, the moon was a massive gold disc rising up just beyond the Jesus tower in the distance, so that was really, really, really cool.

The tower was a great piece of history to check out and provided some lovely views down the Tagus of the rest of Belem and out into the Atlantic. I would say that navigating the complicated stairs system is the most frustrating part of this monument. There is only one staircase that is meant to have a \"down\" time and an \"up\" time. Unfortunately, the person at the bottom (the only staff member) didn't stop people early enough so by the time there was space for people to start descending, the light had already changed back to red. Would be nice to have another staff member at the top of the stairs to help out with this logistical issue."

When we got there the staff closed the tower because there were too many people inside. We waited about 45 minutes before we were let in. In my opinion if you go to the site and read the historical facts on the information boards and take pictures of the tower and adjacent views that is more than enough. Save your money and stay outside."

It is about a 15 min walk from the Monastery of Bel\u00e9m so I would recommend to visit it if you are in the neighbourhood. The views are great and overall I would consider this to be a not-to-miss attraction that is fairly accessible. A small tip is to buy your ticket before hand because the queue at the monument can be long. The best place we found is the museum queue at the Monastery (left most lane). You get a cheaper price if you combine attractions and you can skip the ticket queue when you arrive. One big inconvenience is that to get to the top of the tower, the stair is only large enough to accomodate people going one way. A light system was setup but the concrete result is that a lot of people end up at the top and cannot go down because people keep coming up. We ended up staying at the top for more than 30 minutes until everyone decided to ignore the traffic system and go when the next opportunity came. Overall it was worth it but the experience could have been more organized."

The Monastery itself is an impressive building which is worth visiting if you are spending more than a day in Lisbon, as it is absolutely beautiful. The tower of Belem resembles the monastery in terms of architecture and design, but it can be very windy at the top of the tower (especially outside the summer months.)Another \"must\" stop in Belem is the Pasteis de Belem (opened in 1837) which offers incredibly custard pastries for approximately one euro each. Here is a tip. There is usually a long line running outside of the shop, but you can simply bypass this line and find a table (as the long line outside the bakery is for takeout.) The Berardo Collection Museum is also in the Belem area, and offers free admission to see works by Dali, Picasso, Duchamp, and Warhol. How often to you get to see works by Picasso for free?Belem is easy to reach via the train service from Cais do Sodr\u00e9, or by tram 15 from Pra\u00e7a da Figueira."

When you are at the top look up the hill at the small white church... this is where the explorers would pray before walking down the hill and getting in their ship to explore. This tower is ok overall ... a few cannons and various levels to look out windows or through the fortifications but really nothing else to see within the tower. The spiral staircase to get up the tower is one way ... and it alternates direction every few minutes. We were stuck at the top for 20 minutes or so before our turn to go down. No strollers."

Once inside, the queue continues.

The tower is one of those places that can transport you back to what it must've been like hundreds of years ago as you stand at the ramparts, imagining what the view would've been like in the 1500s. And the view from the tower is quite nice, giving you a wide vista of the surrounding area.On the downside, the tower itself is largely empty on the inside and can take a bit of time to climb due to crowds; the stairwells are single file, so they use a traffic light system to indicate when you can go up or down. You can get away without going all the way up since, as previously mentioned, there's very little inside and you can get perfectly good views on the lower levels.Keep in mind that the tower has been swallowed up by the city and sits just south of a busy road. There's no real neighborhood around it and it feels cut off and isolated. You'll need to use the train to get out to it from the city, but you can walk to the San Jeronimos Monastery from it.I'd give it a 3.5/5 if I could."

Nowadays, located considerably nearer the shore following land reclamation, this is not as evident as it must have been in its heyday.The Tower has a maximum capacity, so you will invariably have to wait in a queue until the previous batch of tourists departs; however, the architecture is decorative and the views stunning. These probably justify a visit alone. It can be cramped inside, and the basement prison is low for anyone who is not accustomed to limbo dancing, but I find the building and its location very attractive.Combine a visit here with one to the nearby Mosteiro dos Jeronimos and to the Padrao dos Descobrimentos (Monument to the Discoveries), then relax at the nearby Botanic Gardens, eat a famed Pasteis de Belem and stroll along the river. Belem deserves to be visited and provides numerous links to Portugal's proud heritage of seafarers, explorers and spice traders."

If you visit the tower before the monastery then buy your entrance ticket to both here as the queue may be shorter. We did the opposite and spent a good hour waiting in line in the sun at the monastery when we could have queued here for just moments earlier in the day. A lesson learnt. However, the tower was well worth visiting as the views are wonderful and the traffic light system on the narrow stairs hilarious. My wife was a bit slow coming down and the 'Master of the Stairs' wanted her to go back up as she was travelling against the lights. When you hear the beeping, hurry up, or you will face oncoming traffic and his wrath ! It is of course a terrific idea and should be used everywhere there is a narrow staircase."

The ground floor is a number of old cannons, the basement is an old jail, the subsequent floors vary from mildly interesting (if you think a rhinos head made from stone will make your day) to dull. The best thing is the number of people employed in the place to make sure that the traffic light system in the stairs is observed - funny thing is that it isn't, despite (literally) 4 guys at the bottom only allowing you access on a green light - on all the other floors its stairwell anarchy and every man for himself. There are lots of other great things to see in Lisbon and if time is limited go and see it, take some photos and skip the interior. Sorry to be so unsupportive but really you'll wait for an hour and wonder why you bothered. This of course is my own opinion and probably varies greatly with other views, but life's a balance!"

The exterior looks so magnificent. We bought tickets to get inside to take a look. First we climbed the narrow staircase all the way to the top to enjoy the view. Because the staircase is narrow, they use the light to signal people to go up and down. On the second floor, there is a terrace. From there you can have a clear look at the \"Monument to the Discoveries \", the River Tagus, and the \"April 25th bridge\u201d. You also can have a closer look at the facade that you can\u2019t see on the street. The day that we visited was showering in the morning, so not many people, we didn\u2019t have to spend any time waiting in line. But when we left the tower the line was starting.Happy Travelling!"

However due to the size of the tower they restrict the number of visitors which can mean a long wait (and we were sixth in line) you can also suddenly find a group tour jumping ahead of you. If you visit the monastery then get the ticket the includes the tower in the price to save money.There is little to see on the ground floor, the first floor views across the river are attractive though. Getting to the higher levels requires going up a steep narrow spiral staircase - something which I cannot do. The staircase also has a traffic light system to ensure that the flow of people is only going up or down at any one time. My husband however made it to the top to enjoy the views.Personally, I don't think I would take my children as the waiting time would not warrant the view in their eyes."

The visit was spoiled by the fact that there is no proper control over the flow of people going up a series of narrow, spiral stone steps, which you must ascend to get to the top. They only allow for one way traffic. There is meant to be a one way system to stop people ascendeing and descending at the same time. However due to the volume of people and people taking no notice of/ not understanding the system, there is a log jam of people stuck trying to get both up and down the stairs. It's a health and safety hazard, and the staff need to take responsibility (they looked resigned to the impossibility of the situation), and need to be on all floors to manage the flow of people before an accident happens or a riot breaks out. We gave up trying to get to the very top because it was too dangerous to proceed under those conditions. I asked for my money back .!.didn't get it....I wish I spoke Portugese! A shame!

Who gets daily allot of touristsThey started the building of the Fortified Tower in the year 1514 and concluded in 1520, and used to protect the place from where the boats left for the India. But with the evolution of the possibilities of attack and defence, the tower lost his function and gradually became to be a custom-house, a lighthouse and telegraphic. And later on it served also s prison for political prisoners. The tower became along the centuries several remodulations. The tower is divided in 5 floors from which we have the first floor as Governor room, the second floor as Kings Room, the third floor as Audience Room, the fourth floor is the Chapel and finally the fifth floor is kept as the \u201cTower ~Terrace\u201d.

The \"Monument to the discoveries\", the \"Museu Do Combatente\" and the Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery are very close by. The best way to get to the tower might be the train from centre of Lisbon (8 min travel and 20 min walk). I had the option to go by car but didn't due to travel forum saying that it was hard to find parking in the area. I found fair enough places so car might be an option. Likewise Tram no 15 takes you to the monastery from which it is only a 10 min walk. I think a visit towards the evening might be best for great photos since you can get photos towards Lisbon rather than towards the harbour without aiming straight into the sun."

Beautiful indeed from outside, but a rather expensive 6 euro ticket for the not so great left inside the building. We had a LISBOA card, so free. Good for takings on the top floor, but very steep and swirl stairs, not for old folks to go up and down, no lifts. 1st floor and top floor were worth the views. 1st floor gives good views of the Padrao dos Descobrimentos and sea-view. Nice and cool breeze, for sunny day.Top floor has a view of the Belem city, of houses in rows going up the mountain. good clicks.Nice dungeon and History you can read. Still not worth if you are FULL price entry. 1st sunday is Free so try that. Better Pics from outside and FREE !!Lots of food opportunities around, though we ate at the NOSOLO Italian Belem, good option."

My wife and I had having previously visited the Torre de Belem and really enjoyed wandering around it, enjoying the views, and imagining its history as a vital strategic fort. Our two girls love a good castle, so we were excited to take them, as they were with us on this trip to Lisbon. We wish we hadn't bothered.We had to queue for 1hr 20 mins just to get in. It was so busy, which isn't their fault. There was a one in, one out rule, which is fair enough. But if you buy a ticket to also visit the Jeronimo Monastery you can get to the front of the Torre de Belem queue. We didn't want to visit the Jeronimo Monastery this time - but as soon as four people came out, four more turned up from their Monastery visit, with their fast passes in the their hands, and the 'standard' queue just crawled along. What we really needed was information to help us make a decision earlier, such as sign saying 30 minutes from here, 45 minutes, from here, 60 minutes from here, etc. We would then not have bothered. But when you queue for these things, as you start to invest time, you start to feel obliged to continue.After 1hr 20 min we got to the front of the queue. After waiting another few minutes as more fast pass people from the Monastery took the places of the people leaving, we finally got to the ticket desk. The man was handwriting every ticket, I think due to a technical fault.Once inside, there was more queuing - on every level to get to the next level!All in all, not a good experience.It is an historic and interesting place, but it's not worth queuing for 1hr 20min to get in. So if you go there and there's a big queue, my advice is just don't bother. The queues for the monastery and the Pasteis de Belem, we noticed, were also horrendous. Having been to Belem four times before I've never seen it like this. Perhaps a one off?"

Apparently any prisoners in the cells got a bath every time there was a high tide ! Originally known as the Castle of St.Vincent. Whenever we have seen it on TV programmes it seems to have lines of visitors waiting to enter the empty rooms and climb to the battlements. On our visit it was a chilly December day, so no lines. It is about 4 miles from the centre of Lisbon, but worth a visit."

Once we were there we were pleasantly surprised to discover as well the monument to exploration, the monastery and the store that creates the pasteis de Belem (nata). I learned that nata means egg custard but the pasteis de Belem are the original natas, being invented by a monk from the nearby monastery. I would recommend a trip out to Belem while staying in Lisbon. Either as part of a tour or just take the 15 tram. All monuments are closed for entry on Mondays."

To be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure if this building was a botanical garden or it was an opera house. I figured the safest thing to do was to go inside and buy a ticket, and see where it took me. It would be my Lisbon-Narnia adventure.I had noticed the building from the apex of a more traditional Lisbon tourist site: the Belem Tower. The building had the feel of a modern opera house built organically to blend in with the Rio Tejo (Tagus River), but it sure had a lot of plants. I was in the district of Belem, one of the main tourist neighborhoods of Lisbon, and there were many things to see - but I was intrigued by this one building.\u201cWhen will you be done cleaning?\u201d\u201cNo, we are a clinic - a cancer clinic.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dIs it my fault that cleaning and clinic sound like each other when spoken with a Portuguese accent? Is it my fault that it really makes no sense to close an opera house or botanical gardens for that matter for \u201ccleaning\u201d? I suppose the short answers are \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018yes.\u2019 I tucked my metaphorical tail between my legs and headed on out the door, as this pristine heavily planted cancer clinic really had nothing to offer me.Fortunately there were other things to do in this picturesque section of Portugal\u2019s capital city: things like taking the lift to the top of the Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos, or the \u201cMonument That Has All Those Explorers.\u201d I\u2019m not sure the latter name has been accepted by the Lisbonian Board of Tourism (or if that committee even exists). In case you were living in an opaque soundproof chamber for the 1500\u2019s, Portugal led the way for Europe in sailing to distant lands, establishing trade for spices, stealing gold from various peoples, and even enslaving other peoples. Nevertheless, we still love to imagine what life was like for Vasco de Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, or Henry the Navigator (who never actually went anywhere!).So the view from atop the tower not only gives spectacular views of the city, but overlooks a compass rose, which on my particular day was populated by a singing slash drumming slash dancing group from East Asia. I also noticed some skilled skateboarders circumnavigating the design from above.Belem is filled with many attractions, including the aforementioned Belem Tower (also providing wonderful scenery including a modern cancer clinic). The Tower itself sits on the Tagus River and was originally built during the Age of Exploration as defense against pesky Spanish and French invaders - the Spanish did in fact sack the tower and turn it into a prison at one point. The tower boasts a wonderful portcullis and is one of those lucky structures left un-crumbled by the Earthquake of 1755.Further Belem exploration took me through the Tropical Garden in hopes of visiting The Museum of Modern Art, an ornate Monastery, the Belem Palace, or even the Maritime Museum (all abutting the park). Alas, I has spent so much time on my quixotic quest to the cancer clinic, the sites had closed. The stroll through the gardens was pleasant however, and included some Asian pagodas and couples looking to steal kisses in the greenery. One issue with this gem of a district is that it is disconnected from the rest of the city. One must take a taxi there as the walk from central Lisbon is too far and not pedestrian friendly.I ended my visit to Belem with a stop at a very local pub. I\u2019m not sure it was a pub, but it sold beer for less that one euro per glass (admittedly these were small glasses), which is unheard of in a major European city. I relaxed for an hour with my pint-sized pints gleefully tipping one hundred per cent on each refill. I would love to give a name of this place, but it was so obscure, that even the local hipsters do not know it exists. Hint: it\u2019s on the road back to the main city.I eventually flagged down a cab and headed back to my hotel for a nap before addressing Lisbon\u2019s vibrant nightlife. Belem really is a must if one goes to Lisbon, especially if you have two days in the city. Get there early, so you can do more than what I reported upon, and avoid a trip to the cancer clinic."

They attached chains from between the opposite coast and Bel\u00e9m to stop enemy ships. A very interesting place. Try to visit it earlier in the day."

As this is an iconic building, we decided to pay it a visit (hint: you can buy a ticket that grants you entry to the Jeronimos monastery, torre de Belem and the monument to the discoveries in one go at any of the three sights - cheaper and saves you a lot of queuing time). Lovely view from the outside with the sea lapping around the building. However, there is a lack of objects of interest once you are in. There were also many other visitors despite the fact that it wasn't peak tourist season (although we did go on a Sunday) that it was difficult to move around. Going up to the top of the tower provided a nice view - unfortunately this involved a one way system where a timer sets a certain amount of time during which you can only walk up or down a very narrow flight of stairs. However, as some people got tired of waiting to go down, they ignored this system (no one at the top to reinforce it although there are staff at the bottom to do so and prevent the top from being over crowded) which caused absolute chaos with people neither being able to go up or down. It took us about half an hour just to get down a flight of stairs that should only have taken less than 5 minutes.Definitely worth having a look from the outside but I would not be too disappointed if you don't go in."

There is now a limit on the number of people who can enter the monument, ok I understand that but it does mean lengthy queues and delays. The recent installation of turnstiles at the bottom of the stairs to the main tower however leads to immense frustration both going up and down. A red and green lighting system is meant to allow fair travel, this doesn't really do that as there are stopping points when going both up and down the tower. This led to an immense queue forming on the roof waiting to descend, in baking hot sunshine. Add some tourists with walking difficulties and it became one almighty traffic jam on the narrow circular uneven surfaced stairs. Not helped by an elderly man employed in the tower to attend to such occurrences...who promptly made things an awful lot worse. A shame because the views from all levels of the tower are quite spectacular, but perhaps not quite worth the entrance fee or the hassle."

This single staircase means groups take turns walking up and down, this led to a build-up of people at the top."

It has historical significance but wasn\u2019t one of the most interesting attractions that we saw in this area.Bel\u00e9m Tower (or the Tower of St. Vincent) is a fortified tower in the municipality of Lisbon. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site (along with the nearby Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery) because of the significant role it played in the Portuguese maritime discoveries. The tower was commissioned by King John II to be part of a defense system at the mouth of the Tagus river and a ceremonial gateway to Lisbon. The tower was built in the early 16th century and is a prominent example of the Portuguese Manueline style. The structure is composed of a bastion and the 100 foot four storey tower.If this review is helpful then please indicate so below."

Unfortunately people don't always realise this or try their luck and keep on going meaning more and more people get stuck at the top. Minor annoyance, but it meant the top was very busy with people and you had to queue to get out. Amazing views though and worth the effort of the climb up there!"

We did not buy tickets in advance and did not really have to wait real long. I believe they do only allow so many people in at once. We also bought the combo pass for this and the monastery. So you can really see why they built this there. From the top you can see quite far. The only way to get to the top is to go up the tiny spiral staircase. It's interesting how they meter the people. There's a timer of 2 minutes for people going up. You get a warning tone, and you need to get off on the next floor. Then the down people go, and they get 2 minutes. Etc. etc. Pretty clever system, and makes more sense when you realize you don't have to climb all the way in the 2 minutes!You can also go into the basement and see the prison area. I'm a tall fellow, and the ceilings are quite short. Worth a look, though.It is a good place to see the city, the bridge, and the river. Definitely a nice photo taking place. Highly recommended!"

If you're buying a ticket to just go into the Torre de Belem, it isn't worth it. Turn around.Basically, I can sum up the site in a paragraph for you. It is a fortress which has roughly 5 levels. only accessible via one very narrow staircase. Each level you stop off at has the same view of the same sea and land. The only difference was at the bottom level, it had several canons in place in front of windows. The levels above, had absolutely nothing in them, but the same windows in the same positions, with the same view. There was a red and green light system, whereby single file queues going up or down each level were made on timer. A very long time was spent queuing up and looking at the screens, waiting until it was our turn to go back down the tower down the narrow staircase. There was not much enjoyment or anything interesting to look at apart from being impatient in getting out of the tower. Just take a look at the tower from the outside, because I guarantee you will think of it as a waste of time getting in and wishing you were out."

People walking up or down have to wait for the light signal before they can start walking otherwise there will be traffic jam and no one is going anywhere. The stairs are so narrow that it only allows one person to move at a time. So be patient. If you ask me whether it is worth the money or time I would say no. But if you want to go and check it out do buy the combo ticket with the visit to the Monastery of Jeronimos to save you a couple of euros. Enjoy....."

So,we bought Lisboa card which gives you free access or discount to a lot of sights&monuments&museums, so this attraction was free for us (also, you have free public transport). This tower is simply stunning!!Very romantic architecture but it was built to protect Lisabon from raids from the ocean/river. You have to wait to get in, and also when you climb the tower,to get to different levels. There's actually a sort of traffic light on the stairs since they are very tight, so that people don't fall over each other cause somebody is trying to go down while others want to go up, so this system they have is clever and prevents such things. For some reason, a small shop on the lower floor (where the cannons are) was closed. It's a nice view from the top too. Also, the tower of Belem is a short walk from the monument of discoveries and the Jeronimos monastery."

Its a good 20 minute walk to get there, and although it is quite an impressive building from the outside, once you get inside you realise that there just isn't very much to see. Because it is such an old building the (one) interior staircase is very narrow and only allows transit in one direction at a time. To combat this, an electronic signage system has been installed which informs visitors when they can transit up or down from each floor. Unfortunately this is ignored (either deliberately or due to low intelligence) by a large number of visitors leading to people pushing past each other on a very steep & extremely narrow circular stone staircase. Once you get to the top the views aren't special - only saving grace was it only cost 2 Euros to visit. In my opinion it isn't worth going out of your way for. It goes without saying that if you have any sort of disability then you will struggle at the Belem Tower."

Yes, the 25th of April Bridge looks cool, but it looks just as cool from the ground. I was hoping for a different perspective on the Jeronimos Monastery, but again, the tower just wasn't tall enough. The building, however, is really cool - like other buildings in Belem, it was built in the Manueline architectural style not seen in other parts of Lisbon, or even Europe. Though if you're looking for an easy tower to climb, this is a good one - I did it while 7 months pregnant and it wasn't too bad. Definitely the first and last tower I climbed on our trip, though! You can get a combo pass for this tower with the Monastery, but if you can get the student rate at either, it's cheaper than the combo.

Admission is limited to about 150 people at one time and to walk around the place takes about an hour.Once inside it was very much a castle experience; the architecture was quite interesting. But the real fun began when we tried to ascend the spiral staircase; there is a \"traffic light\" system that broke down and the results were a bit chaotic - people passing on a spiral staircase is not ideal.There is little inside - but if you spend the time to read the information boards you will understand the history.The views were worth the trip to the top."

The waves crashing up against the stone walls of the tower made me think of how the first explorers setting out West would have felt when they ran into similar storms and would have loved the refuge of the castle. The rains also scared away most of the people in line, so many of the rooms were empty, which left me with plenty of space to wander around and watch the stormy waves from various little alcoves around the tower."

Don't miss the royal palace gates with the famous pastry shop further up the street. If you are interested in sailing and navigation, there is a whole museum at the end of the Abby/church."

Note: don't get off at station named \"Bel\u00e9m\". That name is very misleading. A lot of people got down there because of that name. You'll have to walk a lot. We prepared beforehand so we know that the station to get off should be \"...da Princesa...\" or \"Pedrou\u00e7os\".- The overall scene is very beautiful. You have a river, fresh air, breeze, a fortress, a bridge that looks like the Golden gate from far away and a restaurant nearby, where they have glass wall and excellent view.- Things get stupid as it comes to queue and ticket. Same old story as for all attractions in Lisbon, it takes forever to get to the ticket booth! Seems that they only care for the money from tourists, but not the organizing. After 45 min in the queue, we gave up. Seems that we were lucky because a family which went out from the tower expressed their disappointment as they say \"7.5\u20ac each person for litteraly nothing\". We believed her from our experience in Sintra.So the take away: You really should go to this place. Very nice landscape but just skip getting in the tower. Recharge your viagem ticket beforehand (best choice is full day ticket) otherwise it's 2.85\u20ac/single trip if you buy it on board."

However, in high season it is so busy in Belem that you have to plan your trip well, or you will be stuck outside the torre for a long time (literally hours). Prices are also going up pretty steep, and really, it is not worth paying 6 euro's for it. However, follow this advice and all looks way better: Combine it with the fantastic Jeronimos Monastery. Then it is only 12 euro together instead of 6 for the torre or 10 (!) for the monastery. Moreover, go first to Jeronimos as the ticket line there is often less than 10 minutes, while we had to wait more than an hour in line for the Torre de Belem. Also, avoid the tourist bus hours. Go as early as possible, or very very late. Otherwise you will have to wait also a very long time to be able to go up the very small stairway inside the Tower. Don't expect a marvelous view either from on top of the Tower. If you'd like that, than the Vasco da Gama tower is way cheaper and higher."

They'll use the exit line and that means the queue to enter for people without tickets simply doesn't move. When you get in, well, there's next to nothing in there. A row of cannon, a basement that's being painted (with no room to put anything in either), and then the tower itself. There's only one way up and down, on the same staircase, and using a traffic light system that everyone ignores which means more waiting. The view from the top is ok.

However, the queues were crazy... I don't mind places being busy, especially in August, but the way the queues were handled was awful. A few days before I visited a place with a little tower and had a photo taken as a 'princess in a tower', but in bel\u00e9m I actually felt trapped in the tower. They have a timed system to go up and down the spiral staircase to get to the top and green and red (stop and go) lights to control the flow of people. In theory, this maybe should work, but it didn't, not the day I visited anyway. Something working in theory is fine, but it assumes the visitors, (actually humans :p) are robots... That no one will be slower, or feel a little shaky/nervous in the narrow stairwell... Or God forbid fall (there'd be no time for that!!!) It also assumes that everyone will follow this system, which you'd hope would be the case, but remember humans...Anyway, it was an absolute nightmare. There were people not following the system because they either got aggravated or panicked by being stuck in a room off the stairwell for longer than the timer said and missing their chance to go... Or because initially one lot took that little bitlonger to ascend/descend than the timer allowed... On my ascent, through to the stairwell when it went green for go, when we were nearing the top a loud alarm started beeping at us... But we didn't know what this meant. When we got to the top, a man at the top of his queue to descend was shouting at us that we must stop coming up as it was their turn to come down, but there was nothing we could do at that stage... This was obviously what the alarm was about. This man was just another visitor who was aggravated by the system... There was nobody at each level to explain or facilitate this system which would definitely have helped, even if just for a sense of calm and knowing what the was going on.On my descent, after queuing awhile for this, I quickly realised that I was behind an older lady who was a little slower on her feet, but who had, fair play to her, managed to get up to the top (and why shouldn't she, if she wanted to and was able?). This made our descent slower naturally andwe essentially ran out of time to all get down before the people downstairs were given the green light to ascend, which led to chaos and arguments and us being forced into a small room... This led further to people getting irrate and suggesting that we all just go anyway without the green light, having already miss one turn to go because there were still people going up and down the stairs... Obviously, I could understand this man's frustration but was also having visions of a terrible accident on the stairwell if we proceeded with his plan. Eventually someone who worked in the tower came up and sorted the situation but as a visitor, on my own, I was very near a panic attack and was never so relieved to be out of a place. There has to be a better way of doing things to prevent this sort of situation developing again. Perhaps it was a one off and maybe it works very well most of the time but there needs to be allowances for the fact that people are people and don't always act predictability. Some people don't follow the system, probably more likely when this system is not explained or facilitated at all, or because people all move at different paces for a variety of legitimate reasons...Newgrange in Ireland has only one way in and out and is quite tight, so they just also a certain amount of people in at a time at allocated times, with a guide. Perhaps something similar should be in place here, or at least clear instructions and explanations upon entering the tower, when your ticketsare validated, along with a person working there at each level to ensure everything runs smoothly.Was extremely disappointed with my visit, as well as quite stressed and angry."

It also meant we could skip the queue for this attraction and walk in the 'exit' line, going straight up to the security guard with our ticket, and he scanned it and let us in (cue grumblings from the queue :-) ).Inside was not, however, all that impressive. A few cannons, a dungeon, and a very narrow winding staircase to the roof, with a traffic light system for up/down that mostly failed to control the flow of people at all as a) there were so many people who just ignored it, and b) it didn't allow enough time for the last person of the previous group to get up/down before changing the direction. So the queue to get off the roof went round and round the roof in a spiral formation, with a 15 minute wait to get down. The Torre de Belem is quite interesting from the outside, and reading about its history on the information boards makes for a moderately interesting visit, but overall I was left just a little underwhelmed by it. Especially when the views from the top are nowhere near as impressive as from the much cheaper Discoveries Monument a couple of hundred metres away."

The exterior of the tower is beautiful, as is its location, and the inside is worth a short visit (there is no furniture) if you don't mind standing in the midday sun outside for 90 minutes! My husband and I and our two sons arrived at 11.15am and there was a long queue down as far as the end of the bridge (approx 100 people). The sun was strong and there was no shade. However, we expected the queue to move at a reasonable pace and estimated we would get in to the tower in about 30 minutes once those who had gone in at the 10am opening time were finished with their visit. But after 30 minutes queueing we realised that some new people arriving were bypassing the queue and going straight in. We wondered why. When this continued, we asked a very nice young man working at the tower and he explained that these were people who had purchased a dual ticket over at the nearby Jeronimo Monastery and they were therefore allowed to skip the queue. However, when a flood of people came streaming up the line past us over the next 30 minutes, we, and some other people in the queue, were not at all pleased and protested strongly. We felt we had little hope of getting in at all if this continued and we should have been made aware of this when we started queueing. We were also baking under the midday sun. The person in charge of the tower that day apologised but said these people were entitled to bypass the queue. Having spent one hour already in the queue, we were reluctant to walk away, as some did. When we got to the top of the queue after 90 minutes queueing we saw a notice inside at the ticket desk saying that the maximum number allowed in the tower at any one time is 150 people and that people with dual tickets were priority visitors, as are pre-booked groups and groups with vouchers. Other priority visitors include pregnant women, families with small children, disabled persons and elderly people \u2013 these exceptions are acceptable. If the tower can only take 150 people inside, then this should be stated on a notice down at the bridge, not just at the ticket desk inside. This notice should also give the list of those who can bypass the queue so that those queueing can make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to stand outside in the hot sun for a long time. It would also be helpful if those in the queue were given an estimate of how long they might be standing in the heat outside. Umbrellas to offer shade should also be made available as there is no canopy to escape the sun. The dual ticket system for this tower is not a good idea, nor the fact that groups can bypass the queue. Is there a limit to the size of groups who can bypass? You can purchase a dual ticket at the Belem Tower for the Jeronimo Monastery \u2013 that building can take far more people at any one time so the queue moves much faster than at the tower and the queue is mostly shaded by the building. If those who are in charge of the entrance system at the tower do not change the policy regarding queueing, then I would advise visitors to think carefully before they join the queue at this site."

The good: As this structure is one of Lisbon's top sites to see we had bought a combined ticket with entry to the tower and the Mosteiro dos Jeronimos. The building itself is beautiful and gives you a little bit a time travel experience how the city used to be protected from the seaside.The bad: Unfortunately it is a big miss when it comes to detailed explanation how certain floors within the tower have been used and the rooms are all blank and empty. As only a small staircase connects all floors the visitor flow is managed by traffic lights on each level which could work if people would pay attention to them. So basically you end up waiting on each level to go up or down, which can lead to sunburn on the rooftop level as you eventually arrive on top of the tower just to immediately go back in line to head down and there is no shade to protect you from the burning sun.The conclusion: Although the building itself is impressive to see and gives you a slight idea how the city defended itself against intruders from the sea it isn't really worth the wait in line to get in. You easily can enjoy the building sitting in a nearby seaside cafe or sitting on the steps leading down to the Atlantic Ocean."

This was listed as the #1 site to visit in Lisbon, so we dutifully headed there, having first visited the beautiful Monasterio dos jeronimos (definitely a must see, if your heart is set on the tower then get the joint ticket). Having waited in a queue for 30 minutes, we were admitted to the tower - there is very little in the way of explanations for why the tower is there or what it was so if you don't have a guide book you'll be a bit lost. There is a second floor terrace and from there a spiral staircase leading to upper levels and the roof. There's only one spiral staircase to go up and down, controlled by a traffic light system. One 'set\" of lights was broken while we were there meaning people were heading up and down simultaneously, which felt very claustrophobic and pretty unsafe. Once we arrived at the top, we found that we just had to join a lengthy queue to head back down - seeing the view during your queuing time. The view itself was underwhelming. I really don't feel I'd have missed much If I'd come back from Lisbon without visiting the Torre."

He wanted some sufficient fortification along the mouth of the Tagus River, but he died, and only 20 years later on King Manuel I of Portugal ordered the construction of a military fortification around the beach of Belem.The rectangular Bastion was a later addition, when some years later on the king was advised that the Bel\u00e9m Tower \"should be strengthened, repaired and completed...\u201dDespite these efforts, just some years after the Tower was finished, in 1580, after a short combat, the garrison defending the Tower surrendered to Spanish forces.Reading the history of Belem Tower put a question mark into my mind. Was it worthwhile all the effort and expenses to build it?Oh, yes! For the posterity it was. This very powerful rectangular tower, floating surprisingly graciously in the water, catches your eyes from some distance. The finesse of the building,and the interesting details are inviting you to get closer, and closer.Never mind the crowd and the queuing; it is definitely some of the MUST SEE places in Lisbon. Better start with the Jeronimos Monastery and buy there the double ticket; it makes your waiting shorter. We used the No 15 tram to get there. It was overcrowded and hot, but we had worse experiences already, and it was only a minor problem.After the visit I had only one dilemma. We couldn't decide, that it was more beautiful from outside, or in."

It sits on the water and there is so much to see and do in this park-like setting besides waiting in line.A really interesting statue monument (or maybe it's more like a tower) depicts Lisbon in its Golden Age. Built in about 1960, Prince Henry the Navigator and a whole slew of supporting characters make their way up and to the top most focal point of this parade. The woman on her knees on the monument is the Queen of Portugal (Philipia of Lancaster), mother of Prince Henry.The cross and sword shown as going around the world represents the spread of Christianity. The tower of Belem is the symbol of Lisbon and the 13 year war between Portugal and its colonies. This monument is a memorial to the \"colonial national\" war. The park near the water and these delightful structures offers a separate show daily. While we were there, we saw the Catalunyan Human Tower prepare for their attention-getting sash-wrapping show. In time, it would be a really big stack of people. The wrapping of the sashes (to keep their intestines in one place under pressure? I can only surmise this is the purpose) was all we witnessed. Sadly, the tour bus keeps rolling along and so (not so sadly) does this Catalonyan spirit of independence."

Here's a tip. Visit the Jerome Monastery first. There are long queues always - but buy a multi-entry pass - mine cost 12 Euros (including a small discount). Then march to the top of the Tower queue waiting to buy their ticket and get in without waiting! Bonus. It takes about 10-15 minutes to walk from the monastery to the tower. If you are staying near Rossio metro you could also find the tram stop for the No. 15 retro wooden tram (the canary yellow one featured on all the tourism products) - [look for the queues of tourists!] I bought my ticket in the subway with the help of one of the marvellous English speaking staff [3.30 Euro return - including REUSABLE transport card]. I thought I was to travel Rossio-Belen via subway - but he steered me to the charming historic tram instead. To get home via the same route several air conditioned buses or the No.15 modern yellow tram were available. No old tram - don't know why."

It was named one of the seven wonders of Portugal and it is a known landmark representing Lisbon. The stairs up to the terrace are one way only (look for the red and green light that lets you know if anyone else is climbing them in opposite direction before starting your journey up to the terrace), but once on the terrace you can take amazing photo shots, specially if you are there close to sunset."

Belem is a town west of the Lisbon city center so you have to take a 10-minute train ride to arrive here, but it's worth a visit if you have a hour or two to kill. This tower served as a fortress at the mouth of the river to protect the city during the Middle Ages, so you'll get quite a history lesson when you visit. It's an interesting experience, but isn't a must-see if you have a packed schedule. It does offer a good view of the bay when you get to the top, although the tiny spiral staircase leading you there is very inefficient considering the volume of visitors it must accommodate. Bottom line is that you should visit if you have time, but forego if you don't."

Growing up in Johannesburg's East suburbs we had a chain of coffee shops called Belem with a logo of a white tower - it had always intrigued me as to what this place was and why it was so important to the Portuguese community. Belem tower is right on the river Tagus (although it was originally on an island in the river) and is one of the few major buildings to survive the earthquake of 1755. I suppose it represents the golden era of Portuguese navigation / trade / exploration and conquest. Getting there is really fantastic as you can catch the metro to Cais do sodre (end of the Green line) and then a tram / train to Belem Station. Then you can walk along the Tagus river taking in a view of the 25th April Bridge and marinas as well as a number of museums in the area and the fascist Padro dos Descobrimentos. Worth a half a day if the weather is good"

If you want a good view of the area go to the monument of the discoveries half a mile down the sea front."

Come to find out, the entrance is free on Sundays, from 10am until 2pm, so we got in for free. They only allow 100 people in the tower at a time, so it was a bit slow going. When we reached the first staging area, and finally go a glimpse of the stairs up, Manoli decided she didn't want to climb up the tight spiral stairs, so I went up alone. If it hadn't been free, I'd say it wasn't worth the trouble! There were four flights of tight winding stairs with landings at each floor. They installed a system that was supposed to allow people to go up or down in a systematic way, using red and green arrows to indicate when you were supposed to go up or down, but so many people ignored the signals that it made for general mayhem! When I finally reached the top floor terrace with the great views, I discovered that I'd have to wait in a line of 40 or 50 other folks for the chance to go back down. So, after a minute or two of taking good photos from various points, I waited in line for something like 20 minutes just to be able to leave. Not a very satisfactory system, without any enforcement! The Torre Belem is quite beautiful, but most of that beauty is outside, with a few rooms and some great views from inside. If the crowds are small, I guess going inside would be worthwhile, but if its crowded, I'd just take some good photos from outside and move on."

If you are going to go to the Monasterio san Jeronimo and the Torre de Belem you can buy a combined ticket for 10 euros which means that you can jump the queue at the 2nd site, so don't do what we did and stand in the queue at the Torre, when you already have your ticket you can just walk straight in. If you are scared of confined spaces I would not recommend climbing the tower as you have to climb several very narrow spiral staircases. There is only one set of stairs so they work a clever red and green light system allowing people to climb up and down, which works well as long as everyone abides by the lights. That said you don't have to climb the tower to enjoy the Torre de Belem you can stay on the lower level and still enjoy the views. Allow 30 to 45 mins to see this attraction."

When you do go up the tower there is a green light red light system for when it's okay to go UP and when its okay to go DOWN. The stairwell only allows for one directions and people ignore the system and you could be stuck forever to go wither direction. The view is a non view - just the water and you can get that from so many other vantage points in Lisboa. And then the long trek back to grab a tram back to Lisboa......total waste of a few hours when all was said and done. SKIP"

There is a bell system to let you know when you can climb up or down but it was confusing and there had to be at least 80 people in line on any given level trying to get further up or climbing down. It took us 1/2 an hour just to get to the 2nd level and we finally gave up and headed back down again. Better just view the tower from below and save the 5 Euros."

The roof and upper floors of the tower are reached by one thin spiral stairwell: I don't think the 15th Century builders were planning for thousands of tourists traipsing up and down all day. The stairs are so narrow only one person can safely walk up, or down, at a time. They've implemented a traffic light system so that, in theory, people going up won't bump into people coming down. Unfortunately a lot of people were ignoring it, so by the time we got to the roof more people were flooding up and nobody was getting a chance to go down. It was quite funny seeing the puzzled look on people's face when they reached the top and had to immediately join the queue to get back down because the roof was so crowded. It was also funny seeing how many people bumped their heads on the small doorframe- watch out for that, btw.The Torre de Belem is a beautiful building, but I'd recommend just staying outside and taking your photos from there. Unless you have a deep interest in medieval Portuguese history, in which case get inside, take a look around the cellar prisons and try to be patient with people who don't understand that green means go and red means stop."

The tower is well preserved, there's a sailboat marina nearby - the sailboats were more interesting to me :) And there's a cute little tent-shop kiosk area at the walkway, with actual handmade embroidery articles and lots of tourist trinkets."

(Standard miserable Portugese ticketing staff - where do they get these morose people ?!). It's certainly not a large attraction but it's very ornate.Getting up and down the tower one has to enter a room at the bottom via some turnstiles (They limit the number of people in the tower) and obey some traffic lights to go up / down the stairs. This seemed a really good idea as the stairway is v narrow. Either the timing was all wrong or people were ignoring the green / red arrows but it seemed to cause no end of trouble.There's not a lot to see inside - the view from the top of the tower is impressive though.We passed the tower later - mid afternoon and there were huge queues to get in - so get here early.The attractions main selling point is simply viewing it from outside.

However, it is devoid of any of its internal history, it is just a continuum of empty rooms. The overwhelming memory I will take away from this experience is the amount of queuing we had to do, and the danger we were placed in, to commit to this opportunity to queue.This monument has a single stone spiral staircase up and down the building. On the day we went we had torrential rain, so the staircase was wet. Whilst a sign said a max. of 120 people in the tower there were actually far more than this. I would have thought they may have noticed that hundreds of people were entering but no one seemed to be leaving, but apparently not. The spiral staircase was managed by a traffic light system, which may have well been semaphore, because either people didn't understand the difference between green and red, or they didn't care. Anyway, the result was that by the time we got to the top we had to queue for an hour to get down. When we did finally get the green light to go down we had to climb across thousands of people trying to get up, and all on a 600cm wide wet stone spiral staircase. All in all not a great advertisement for Portuguese tourism, or indeed for humanity itself!"

In the lover part is a sort of exhibition (you need max 5 min to see everything). Than there is the tower. Well I almost loose my mind because of the staircase to the top. It is so narrow that people can either go up or down. You have a traffic light showing you what to do. But people ignore this and the staff doesn't care! it is horrible!! Once you managed to get to the top you can only stand in the line and wait do get down. It has taken 20 minutes for me to get into the staircase again. Don't recommend this for older people and people with some kind of disability."

The view at the top of the tower is great, but to get there you have to go through a winding staircase that is only big enough for a single flow of people either up or down. They have a unique light traffic system for people with red and green arrows indicating who goes when and where.Tips: For all attractions check opening & closing times to avoid disappointment. The Lisbon Card is very useful especially if you are in Lisbon for a few days. We purchased the 72 hour card and is was so convenient for all forms of transports as well as providing free or discounted entry into attractions. It paid for itself and we ended up marking significant savings overall."

We took a taxi to the tower from Rossio area (~8-10 euros). There is a fee for the tower, but it is free on Sundays. After visiting the tower walked on the river bank towards the city all the way to Ponte 25 de Abril. It was a very pleasant walk on a hot day. On the way, on the opposite side of the avenida there is Mosteiro dos Jeronimos - another beautiful Manueline building worth visiting. Under the Ponte there is a marina with many restaurants in it. We had dinner there, then took taxi to the hotel. That was a very nice day - culture, fresh air, a bit of exercise and great food."

Belem is, to my opinion, well worth a visit. If you're interested in history, architecture and culture you can easily spend at least half the day out there.First tip: Don't come early! From the morning until about lunchtime, the place is very busy with tourists coming in groups with hundreds of buses. After lunch the pressure is normally much less.Second tip: The city tram # 15 is the straight forward way to get there, but it is often quite busy. And if you are two or more people, and don't have a Lisboa Card or a Day Ticket to go for free, you will be better off taking a Taxi. From Rossio to Belem is about 7\u20ac."

Take the bus or tram to Belem, and walk the mile of so through formal gardens, past the Vasco da Gama monument, (and maybe visit the Joachim Monastery which survived the earthquake - great example of Manolian architecture).The promenade is alongside the waterfront, and gives a great vista out to sea, and it is easy to imagine the centuries of seafaring which happened right there. The ancient Tower itself is white and profusely decorated with plumes and patterns, so it quite resembles a wedding cake! There are displays and staff, but generally you can wander over several floors, giving interesting views and photo opportunities. Don't miss the Belem pie shop - the custard flans are famous, but I would thoroughly recommend the duck pies - YUM!"

Inside there isn't a lot to see though, and it can feel claustrophobic. So if there are a lot of people, it may be wise not to bother with the inside of the tower at all, but to walk back a few yards and see the aeroplane-monument nearby, commemorating the first Portuguese flight across the Atlantic, in 1922. (The aeroplane is a replica of the one that made the flight.) There's a grassy area where children can play, and a cafe / restaurant just across the path."

However, I'd never been IN the tower until this visit to Portugal. From the outside, it's hard to see that the tower has about 5 different floors. These are connected by a single spiral staircase made of stone and made when people were much smaller. It wasn't made to have 500 hefty and pushy tourists on it at the same time. And especially, it was never intended to be the Tower of Babel with Japanese, German, Chinese, Spanish, French and English all being shouted at the same time. The problem with the Tower of Belem is the \"traffic system\". Each floor consists of a room. In theory, as you go up you should only go up one level and pop into that room... thus allowing the people from the room above to come down..... but it is not clearly explained and the screens indicating what people should be doing (coming down or going up) are inside the rooms... so they people on the stairs have no idea what they should be doing. While I was there it got incredibly ugly with people trying to move in all directions on this tiny staircase. People were screaming at each other in different languages and nobody was doing anything to try to solve the impasse. I got stuck on one floor for 15 minutes because it was impossible to move down. The room filled up with others like me... and we all got fairly frustrated. I don't ever want to be INSIDE the Tower of Belem again."

We had to wait at the landings as the same staircase was being used by peolple to come down and go up. You had to wait for approximately 2 minutes at each landing with the red light flashing until the green signal comes on indicating that it is your turn to go. Once at the top we enjoyed a nice view of the Tagus river, 25th April Bridge and the Discoveries Monument.There is nothing much to see and the entry fee of 5 Euros is not worth it.

But like everything else the place is mobbed with visitors in high season. Had some seafood snacks in one of the adjacent cafeterias sitting on the banks of the Tages estuary and that was decent.Took the train back, its fast-ish and certainly cheaper!"

Sometimes, a high rating has more to do with the memories it creates, much more so than the actual sights or activities. I would say that such is the case with the Tower of Belem, which in itself is not that unique - but is in a nice setting a little bit outside of LisbonWhat I liked: Relatively affordable, outside of all of the \"noise\" of downtown Lisbon. It also provided a bit of a reprieve from the heat and humidity of the big city as there was a nice breeze seaside. The tower is well organized as far as managing foot traffic in tight staircases, and there was ample space for our little one to \"safely run around\". Great photo-ops and a nice place to be on a sunny dayWhat to watch for/could be improved: Infrastructure near/around the tower is minimal. There is some sort of restaurant area nearby that sells overpriced/average quality dishes. Also if travelling by tram with a little one (stroller) getting across the train tracks to the tower requires a bit of work. The park around the tower is ok - but again, very nothing out of this world..."

            "review": "History around every corner. The Bel\u00e9m quarter is arguably one of the most pleasant and interesting areas in Lisbon. Once a beach, the shore line reaching to the Monastery of Saint Jerome, Belem has tremendous historical significance for Lisbon and Portugal. It was here that the sailors came to pray at the small Restelo Chapel and later at the Monastery before setting off in their voyages of trade and discovery, in the 15th and 16th centuries, the time when Lisbon was the capital of the largest empire in the World.It was also here that the most significant examples of the very Portuguese Gothic Manuelin style were built: the Monastery of Saint Jerome and the Bel\u00e9m watchtower.It is the birthplace of one of the icons of Portuguese gasfronomy: the portuguese custard tart, the Pastel de Bel\u00e9m.Finally, it houses many museums and one of the most important modern art collections in Europe, the Berardo collection at Belem Cultural CentreTheres enough to see in Belem to keep you busy for a whole day, so plan your trip ahead.Here's my suggested itinerary:You can reach Bel\u00e9m from central Lisbon by tram (take nr.15, starting at Figueira Square), by train from Cais do Sodr\u00e9 station (check the timetables as not all trains stop at Bel\u00e9m) or by bus. Of course, you can always take a taxi.Your starting point is Bel\u00e9m Garden just opposite the Palace of Bel\u00e9m, or Pink House, once a royal palace and now the President of the Republic's seat and office.The first stop is the Carriages Museum (Museu dos Coches). The museum is currently (August 2013) at the Palace of Bel\u00e9m, its main entrance next to the Palace's main gate. However, the museum will soon be transferred to a huge white modern building close to palace. The carriages museum houses a collection of carriages used by the Portuguese Royal Families, the Clergy and some other noble families, since the 16th century up to early 20th century. Pay particular attention to the amazing 18th century carriages and the one used for Queen Maria I's coronation.Upon leaving, walk towards the huge monastery of Saint Jerome, easily visible from the museum. On your way, stop for a mid-morning snack at the Real F\u00e1brica Dos Past\u00e9is De Bel\u00e9m. This apparently small and traditional pastry shop is actually a maze of rooms, as you'll discover when you enter. However, the room where the main counter is is the original one. This shop was the birthplace of the portuguese Pastel de Bel\u00e9m in the 18th century and it gained the informal status of monument over the years. It's a must see attraction in Bel\u00e9m. You can buy packs of six to take out, but my suggestion is that you do it the Portuguese way: have a seat and ask for a coffee and a Bel\u00e9m custard tart (say \"um caf\u00e9 e um pastel de Bel\u00e9m\"). Remember that you'll get an expresso when you ask for a coffee in Portugal. Also, you can find custard tarts everywhere in Portugal and in some places abroad, but only these ones can bare the name \"pastel de Bel\u00e9m\" (Bel\u00e9m custard tart); everything else is just \"pastel de nata\" (custard tart). Make sure you sprinkle your tarts with lots of cinnamon and icing sugar.After your snack, it's time to visit the World Heritage Site of the Monastery of Saint Jerome (Mosteiro de Bel\u00e9m or Mosteiro dos Jer\u00f3nimos, in Portuguese). Entrance is paid but worth every cent. See the decoration that incorporates sea inspired motifs, typical of the Manuelin Style; have fun spotting ship ropes, compasses, anchors, etc. Check also the tombs of Vasco da Gama and of Cam\u00f5es (Portugal's national poet), the amazing church, the cloister (where Portugal's accession to the EU, in 1985, and the Lisbon Treaty, in 2007, were signed), the refectory, the choir and the Fernando Pessoa's memorial. If you have the time and interest, check the Archaeological Museum, at the monastery's building and/or the Maritime Museum, further down.It should be lunch time when you finish your visit to the monastery. There are plenty of options to choose from in Bel\u00e9m, but I suggest you grab a bite to eat at the Cultural Centre's cafeteria and then visit the Berardo Collection (free entrance).After a dive into modern art it's time to go back to the 16th century. I suggest you walk to the Bel\u00e9m Watchtower, an ex-libris of Portugal, which is about 10 minutes walk from the Cultural Centre. The tower was built on the 16th century to guard the entrance to the very rich port of Lisbon. It doubled also as a siniter jail. The tower is a stereotype of the Manuelin style, built during the Discoveries golden age and it stands now as the country's memorial to those days. The tower sat on the shore of a beach right until the 1940's; the river's eroding effect and urban works have turned the area into what it is today.There are other things to do around the Tower:- you can visit the Colonial War Memorial, a 2-3 minutes walk from the tower- the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, a state-of-the-art research centre dedicated to brain diseases and cancer research. The Centre is an architectural jewel, with interesting details such as the Pillars of Heaven, two concrete columns with the top painted in blue that seem to connect with the sky on clear days, or the Window of Hope, from where patients being admitted to the Centre can see the scientists working to save them. Do bare into consideration that one of the buildings is the research and treatment area, with patients with terminal diseases walking in and out; do show some restraint, this is not a monument. On the other hand you can walk around the common area or visit the Darwin restaurant at the Administration building. Also, an extension of the Guggenheim museum is scheduled to open soon here;- in the Summer months you can take a cruise in the Tagus starting from a quay close to the tower;- just stroll around or have a picnic on the grassFrom the Tower, walk back towards the Cultural Centre, but don't cross the railroad, stay on the side closer to the river.I suggest you stop for a drink at the Mensagem bar of the amazing Altis Bel\u00e9m Hotel and enjoy the view of the river, the 25th of April suspension bridge and the Monument to the Discoveries, your next destination.On your way to the Monument you'll see the only two surviving buildings of the 1940 Portuguese World Expo, a huge exhibition undertaken by the fascist regime to celebrate the 800th anniversary of Portugal's foundation that turned the Bel\u00e9m quarter into what it is today.The Monument to the Discoveries is a ship shaped building, built for the 1940 Expo, which main feature are the statues of all the historical figures who were related to the Discoveries. Of course, the leading figure is Prince Henry, the Navigator.The main attraction of the monument is the rooftop terrace. The view from the top is a must and it is definitely the best vantage point to see Empire Square and the huge marble World map set on the square in front of the Monument, a gift from the Republic of South Africa for the 1940 Expo. The map shows the ports of call and dates when they were reached by the Portuguese.Your day should be finishing by now. I suggest you take tram 15 back to Lisbon or stroll around the area and have dinner at one of the restaurants close to Empire Square.Enjoy!"

The cloister in San Jeronimo is incredibly beautiful and well preserved, the best part of this huge complex of buildings. Absolutely recommendable. Belem Tower is a great place to see, very beautiful and nicely preserved. The only problem: it is badly organized, there is a huge line to go upstairs, stairs are pretty narrow and people go upstairs and downstairs in turns, with the help of red and green lights, this system does not work well, and waiting time upstairs can be pretty long."

I never made it to the top but stopped one level from the top and tried to watch a video - pretty impossible with people talking about the up down system.

It costs 5 euros to get inside and on the ground floor you have canons facing out the windows. You then get the pleasure of going up the stairs. Be prepared to queue! They have a 'system' where you have to wait 2 minutes each time to get up or go back down. However, people don't always stick to this causing problems on the narrow staircase.When you get to the top you realise that you may as well join the queue to get back down ASAP as the process is so slow. People's faces as they realised this was pretty priceless but not worth the 5 euros. Take pictures from the outside instead and save yourself the pain."

The area around has attractive gardens but unfortunately our time was limited.There is a walk of up to half an hour to the Torre de Belem, (passing the monumument of the discoverers) which sits in the river and you cross a drawbridge to enter.

The whole result is a masterpiece of religious monument, classified as a World Heritage.The Nave and de South Portal are amongst some of the world masterpieces of architecture and religious significance, considering the years when it was build.Next to it, don't miss Torre de Bel\u00e9m, a once XVIII century fortress, placed in river Tejo, those days ago, and now in its margins. It's a perfect example of war architecture of those days, defending the entrance of river Tejo.Nowadays it can be visited without the fears of tiding waves. The whole construction, specially its tower, is a magnificent example that must be explored by tourists.And you can't miss the Centro Cultural de Bel\u00e9m, a huge complex where you attend to a several kind of shows, from opera to theatre, permanent and temporary exhibits, jazz and photo hapennings, music performances, and the wholesome Berardo's Collection of modern art, which includes paintings of Warhol and Liechtenstein.

So much to see for a reasonable 7 euro's. The Torre de Belem on the river is also worth a visit, along with the Padrao Dos Descobrimentos a monument dedicated to all the Portuguese explorers. Both have fantastic views of the area including the marina, the 25th of April Bridge, the Royal Palace the botanical gardens to name a few. You could easily spend a full day here as there is so much to see, ensure you wear comfortable footwear."

And number one pastry is the crunchy flaky custard tart - NOTHING LIKE the one at 2 for \u00a31 at Tesco! The one you get with superb coffee is at the Pastry Factory at Belem. This Pastry shop at Belem is to Lisbon as Harry Ramsden's chippie was to West Yorkshire (before it spread its brand to every motorway service station). The front of the place is a work of art in traditional blue tiles. Only a few metres from the Pasteleria is the monumental Abbey of St Gerome with its wonderful carved fa\u00e7ade stretching for over one hundred metres along the flower- decked park that once was the quayside of Belem in the time of the great navigators. Vasco da Gama's ornate tomb is within. Then across the park you can reach the river Tagus riverside and pass the seaplane that was the one that made the first flight from Portugal to Brasil. From here one reaches the Tower of Belem -a lovely limestone richly carved fortress that once was set on an island in the river. Finally there is the monument to the navigators erected almost five hundred years after the Belem tower but now THE landmark on the riverbank It is built like a ship's prow crowded with all the historic figures looking out to the sea."

The beautiful, ornate monastery of Jeronimos, the magnificent statue of the discoverers and the pasteis de nata make this journey really enjoyable, as well as the tram ride itself.Only problem is, that so many other tourists were also doing the same thing ( read about it on Tripadvisor!!) that the tram was very full and we waited nearly 45 minutes for the next one to come along. Worth it in the end though.TIP.- get the day ticket which enables you to travel on the local transport (6.50\u20ac pp) includes buses, metro and funicular cable cars and includes trams so makes the trip to Belem quite cheap!"

Walking around was very easy and there were enough spots where one could put their feet up and relax a bit and may be have a pasteis de nata or two. Belem is believed to have some of the best. I tried some and I have to agree they were tasty, especially with the cinnamon! Take a stroll by the Belem Tower, the monastery and go by the bridge that looks like San Francisco's Gold Gate bridge. You won't regret spending a day there!"

In Lisbon it is definitely the most impressive sight to be seen. But the maritime museum with its collection of ship models and ornate ceremonial barges has a great deal of fascination. Not many people bother to walk the distance to that end of the monastery building so it is a pleasantly reflective experience to visit the maritime section. And even fewer bother to call at the coach museum down the road. Maybe that will change when it moves to a fine new building. The coaches are old, evocative, and strange. They range from monstrous gilded coaches built to impress (one feels sorry for the horses) through fast, elegant vehicles to sedan chairs. Delightful and a bit strange as a museum ought to be.Finally: the pasticceria which is the source of the custard tarts. They are DEFINITELY the best. I sampled dozens during 4 weeks in Portugal and these were up to the travel book description. It is worth sitting down in the busy restaurant to savour them with coffee. Belem is great fun."

Oh and be sure to sample the custard tarts at the cafe in the main street \u2013 they really are by far the best, as we ascertained by a serious comparative tasting at the fanciest Lisbon cafes!"

Belem Tower, built in 1515 at the mouth of the Tagus river as a fortress to guard the entrance to Lisbon's harbor and as a ceremonial gateway to Lisbon was once located on an island near the shore of the Tagus River. Today is sits on the northern bank of the river.The 4 storyTower, about 98 feet tall by 39 feet wide, is an excellent example of the Manueline architectural style. The interior will take you via narrow circular staircase to the top. The ground floor bastion still has the cannons in the niches. On the first floor interior of the Tower is the Governors Hall (Sala do Governador) which opens into the cistern. .On the second floor, the King's Hall (Sala dos Reis) opens to the loggia (overlookig the river) and features a small corner fireplace, The third floor is the Audience Hall (Sala das Audi\u00eancias). The fourth floor features a chapel.We especially enjoyed seeing the gargoyle facets & the watchtower cupolas.Location: Avenida da India, Belem. (Tram 15E)Open: 10AM-6:30PM - Closed Mondays Admission: \u20ac5 (free with Lisboa Card) NOTE: You can purchase a combined ticket that includes admission to both Belem Tower & Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery for \u20ac10 OR you can purchase the Lisboa Monumental (includes Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery,Tower of Bel\u00e9m and Ajuda Palace - \u20ac13) Senior discount (65+) = 50% discount"

Columbus, after discovering America, stopped in Belem on his way home.This area, rich in history, contains such wonders as the Belem Tower, the Monument to the Discoveries, the Jeronimos Monastery with it's amazing cloisters, the Ajuda Palace, and the Coaches Museum, Belem is where you can admire the intrcate details of Manueline architecture.Don't miss treating yourself to a delicious custard tart at the famous \"Pasteis de Belem\".Getting here: Public transportaion in Lisbon is very easy to use.

It is striking and worth the visit but in the area there are a number of museums that you should consider. Firstly the Museu Nacional Dos Coaches, this sounds tame but these coaches were collected in the later part of the 19th century by the Queen. It is amazing to see these coaches at close hand, they ornate, large and opulent. The Museu Nacional De Arqueologia has a number of collections from the earliest times to later Roman and subsequent civilisations. The best has to be the Maritime Museum with models and artifacts that trace the history of Portugal that was once a great maritime power.There is a hop on hop off bus that tours this area and it is well worth while as it also tours the area away from the river area and museums. The houses and views from the suburb are well worth the effort."

            "review": "Don't miss Belem!. There's so much to see in Belem, you'd need two days to cover everything - so these were my reactions:Mosteiro dos Jeronimos - a must-see for the amazing carved stonework in the cloisters, which has much in common with that in Rosslyn chapel (of Dan Brown fame), down to the green men, roses and thistles(?) or maybe pomegranates, and ropes - which were made locally. The cloister is ringed with an astonishing collection of 'meat and two veg' (phalluses) which sometimes morph into skulls - pretty obvious if you look carefully, but can be overlooked if not! The church is OK (nice carved pillars) but far less interesting to me.The Tower of Belem has much of the same stone carving themes (minus phalluses) and is well worth a visit - excellent view from the top. The stairs are steep and narrow, and so a one-way timer system is in operation - this works fine except when some twits choose to ignore it. Don't miss the carved rhinoceros, which can be seen from a narrow passage just before the start of the spiral staircase.Padrao dos Descombrimentos - a large modern tower with carvings of Portugese explorers and notables, this was built during the lengthy reign of autocratic prime minister Salazar, so it's not surprisingly rather fascistic in style - worth seeing from the outside, and maybe for the view (there's a lift) if you can't manage the steps in the old Tower.National coach museum - great if you like coaches, OK if not - muted lighting to prevent the colours fading. There are three massive coaches which were presented to a pope - completely OTT with their carved figures, one has recently been restored. Most interesting (to me) was the coach in which the Portugese king Carlos 1 and his son Prince Royal Luis Filipe were assassinated in 1908 - the bullet holes are visible. Ironically, the coach museum was inaugurated by the queen and king in 1905.You can catch a snack in the famous Pasteleria de Belem - easier if you go through the LH door to the back rooms and get waiter service. There is a lovely view from the cafe (NOT restaurant) in the modern cultural centre - not easy to find - follow signs for the Berardo collection and the cafe is on the left (river side)."

If the pastry shop looks crowded in the front, make your way to the back as there is HEAPS of space further in. Table service is faster than queuing up at the counter too. Went to the tropical gardens, and although it was relaxing sitting in the shade and reading, there wasn't much tropical about it, and all the buildings were so run down, many were in a state of ruin. Sad to see.If you get the 15 tram out there (an overrated experience) be prepared for sardine simulation! Better to get it from the start point if you can, rather than along the way. Would be a nightmare on hot days!The Belem tower was OK, but if you want something special, head further out (150m) past the amazing war memorial to the very modern looking Cancer research building and have lunch at the Darwin Cafe there, looking out over the water. Not crowded, and great and innovative food."

We took public transportation to Belem and walked over to the Jeronimos Monastery, founded in 1500s, and today it is an archeological museum. It is a marvel of Manueline style of architecture. Many important historical figures are buried here, among them, Vasco da Gama. We walked over to the Tower of Belem, a monument to Portugal's Age of Discovery. It is a classic landmark, a Unesco site. This monument from the 1500 stands on the spot where the explorers set out to see. If you go in and climb to the top, you can enjoy a beautiful view of the river with its sailboats, as well as pastel rooftops in the hills nearby. We also visited the modern stone sculpture, the Monument to the Discoveries -- shaped like a giant ship with explorers, crusaders, monks, etc. looking beyond, led by Henry the Navigator. A very impressive monument at the foot of which is a map of the world in multicolored marble, showing the places Portuguese explorers landed, and the dates. After having lunch at a water's edge restaurant, we stopped at the famous pastry shop, Pasteis de Belem, where they've been making the ubiquitous Portuguese custard cream tarts since 1837 or so. After having tasted it at breakfast, I wasn't jumping up and down to taste it, but our Frommer's suggested it not be missed. All I can say, is that it was heavenly!!!"

The carriage museum was the biggest surprise and we would strongly recommend if you have any appreciation of history. it was free, and inside amongst dozens of vintage carriages they had the carriage used by Philip the Second in the Sixteenth century. That really took our breath away and I spent a long time just gazing and imagining it in use at that time. It's really worth looking inside the Monastery and the Tower As you walk from the Monastery along the waterfront to the Tower you pass a very nice cafe where we had a fantastic lunch in the sunshine. Also, don't miss the Pastelleria near the Monastery for the \"pastel nata\" pastries. You can't miss it as there is usually a queue outside. Don't be put off - they are probably queueuing for the shop to buy pastel nata's, and you should be able to walk past and go inside to the cavernous cafe and get a tea of coffee while you watch these delicacies being made."

As narrow and steep as they are, they need to serve people on their way up and down. What we disliked?

Not somewhere we had planned to visit but on route from the railway station to the Mosteiro dos Jeronimos and a handy place to shelter from the rain. Actually quite a fascinating place and well worth a visit.Onto the Mosteiro - very busy as you would expect from the country's greatest national monument. Well worth a visit to appreciate the Manueline style.Thereafter to the Museu Berardo. Rather disappointed to be honest. All a bit over the top. However, a leisurely lunch at the adjoining cultural and conference centre more than made up for this.Then a short walk to the Torre de Belem and energetic climb to the top to enjoy the sunshine as it came out.A walk along the waterside to the Padrao dos Descobrimentos then back to town to catch the no. 15 tram ended a very enjoyable day.Only advice - wear a pair of comfortable shoes and don't plan an energetic evening!"

Head out to Belem early - before the tourist buses hit this small suburb of Lisbon. easy way out is tram 15E from parco de comercio. you feel part of the city on a tram! My advice is to get out at the Monastery and head for Belem Tower first (entry5e) walk up the very very small steps - can only imagine how packed it is in the height of the season. walk back via monument to the discoveries and then head across to the Monastery of St Jeronimo where the famed Vasco Da Gama is buried. walk back towards Belem - taking in a famous custard cake in the famed cake shop (blue awning) on the right. Two streets back is the coah museum - that for me was one of the real finds of the trip to Lisbon ...so try and take in a visit before heading back on the ram. Jumping off at Cois Roch stop. on the opposite side you will see big white steps that bring you up to the National Museum of art and artifacts (entry 5e). Go to this museum just to see the Bosch. it is amazing."

If we were to do it again we would go earlier in the day so as to have more time to visit the other sites and also to visit the Torre early in the day. As it is a stone spiral stairs to the top there is a queue from each level to the next. We skipped most levels and went straight to the top. The same queue happens on the way down but people coming up were very helpful and allowed me to pass down while they waited as I had a child with me. The Torre is not recommended for people who have difficulty walking and with very small children(toddler or younger) as when it is crowded you really need your wits about you.

The food in those restaurants is basic typically for tourists but ok. During the summer it will be a bit crowded in the main street and around the restaurants, but the gardens will be a nice respite. if you \"hopped\" off one of the sightseeing buses check the stops carefully to \"hop\" back on as they are not where you expect them to be by looking at their map.

The Belem Tower is about a half hour walk away along the waterfront and you can buy a combined ticket to see both attractions. It is a lovely setting to see the Tagus River. The Maritime Museum is located beside the Jeronimo Monastery and has a beautiful, comprehensive set of boat models illustrating Portuguese sea history. The display is pretty didactic and not all displays are in English. There also is a wing to this museum with full sized boats which are quite impressive. If you are into sailing and naval history it is worth a visit.Getting to Belem can be a challenge if you go by tram. It is a half hour trip from downtown (Baixa) and if you are on a small trolley it can be quite crowded. The larger, newer trollies are recommended but you need to have change to ride them.

Pretty balconies on each floor, providing a wonderful view on all directions; a romantic view of the Tagus river , the Belem area and the Monument of Discoveries. The Manueline inspired architectural design is there, but one can also see a strong Venetian influence. On the very center of the Tower is a carved image of Our Lady of Safe-Homecoming, facing the river, whom the sailors prayed for protection and a safe voyage (reminded me of a similar image of Our Lady back home).Going up to the summit of the tower, I got dizzy because of the narrow, spiral staircase.

Tourist buses do spoil the peace a bit so try to dodge their arrival. The archaeological museum was disappointing - as was the maritime museum in the main. We arrived before 2 and so entry to the museums was free and we dipped in to see a few exhibits, but I wouldn't be inclined to pay for either. The Pastais de Belem is WONDERFUL - we had a lovely lunch there...don't be put off by the crowds outside, go through to the back where there is a huge refectory-style dining area. The Museum of modern art in the cultural centre is well worth a visit."

The view from the rooftop and through those windows are spectacular. Didn't completely understand Manueline style until I went in to this tower- rope/globe/lattice work/roof form/spire on its stoneworks greatly appreciated by ones fingertips. This is the power that this wonderful tower offers. This place is not hard to reach. We reach this place by riding one of those sightseeing/drop off-hop in buses for 18 euros per head coming from Marques de Pomball. Use this place to get to Jeronimos Monastery et al."

This famous historical and cultural area provides an excellent illustration of the principle that the Portuguese lose few opportunities of shooting themselves in the foot. Firstly, they have located this area, containing about half the city's main attractions about as far from its geometric centre as is possible. Having done so, they then cut it in two by the rail service to Estoril and Cascais. Most people reach it by Tram no 15 from Metro Station Cais Sodre -------- a 45-minute journey each way including an average wait time. At peak periods, the longer waiting time can add a good half-hour to the journey. There is so much worth seeing in these 20 or so acres that a full day visit should be planned. Pride of place goes to the Hieronymus Monastery with its handsome nave and beautifully carved double-tiered cloisters ----- a favorite venue for fashionable weddings. The building also houses the Museum of Archaeology and the initial section of the Marine Museum in its West Wing. The latter then extends in a U-shape, that encircles the Gulbenkian Planetarium, and does a left-turn to accommodate the largest of its galleries devoted to the Royal Barges as well as a cafeteria. Opposite, but only 30 ft away is the vast complex known as the Belem Cultural Center, a pleasing and impressive modern structure containing nothing that would ever entice you to step inside it. On the other side of the railway, and accessed by a grim underpass, lies the Monument to the Discoveries, decorated externally by some magnificent carving, and internally carrying an elevator to the panoramic roof offering fine views over the Tagus estuary. A pleasant walk along a recently-constructed promenade brings you to the celebrated Belem Tower that served more as a prison than as a genuine defence resource. Going in the opposite direction, towards the centre of town, you will pass on the North side the celebrated Belem Tart Shop that now has a few tables and chairs to help feed the hungry visitor. Further on, one passes the Belem Palace in which the President of Portugal resides, guarded by two bulldogs in uniform. with swords drawn. The East Wing of this Palace, formerly the Riding School, has now become the Coach Museum where a collection of glittering coaches, sedans and cabrioles lined up for inspection displayamazing carvings, paintings and other decorative skills. The area includes two parks with fountains and statues, and plenty of bench seating for reading and picnicking, but a bite of food to chase away the hunger can be had inexpensively in the colorful neighborhood cafes and restaurants, and people-watching is the main free entertainment."

If you are around on a Sunday or a national holiday, many of the attractions here are free, worth adjusting your schedule if you can. The Torre de Belem is worth going to if free, wouldn't bother paying though. It gets quite crowded on Sundays though as the staircases are narrow. The Mosteiro is beautiful and currently has a good exhibition on the history of the monastery and Portugal. There is also the Monument to the Discoveries which you can go up to get great views of the surrounding area (not sure if this is free on Sundays as we didn't go in). A visit to Belem requires a visit to the Pasteis de Belem where you can get freshly baked custard tarts and coffee. Don't be put off by the crowded and narrow entrance as the place is cavernous and has space for hundreds of people in the back - keep walking through the room until you find a table! Even when it looks really busy you will get served very quickly."

What a shame Lisbon should let itself down so badly like thisLong walk back to the Belem Pasteis bakery - DO NOT MISS THIS - or the Pasteis - served warm and crispy in their vast restaurant = what a fascinating operation and what a stunning product - and not a rip off - best thing we ate in Portugal by miles.Finally, the Coach Museum - really interesting collection of vanity projects (Boy, did their Royalty \"Go For It!\" or what?) in a beautiful old Indoor Riding School - well worth a visit, we think."

Its directly by the Tajo river and you have great views of the bridge. Along the river we took walk to tower Belem. Because Sunday are some sights for free, we could get inside the tower without paying. We walked up the stairs to the tower top, but its really tight circle stair case, pretty dangerous and was very busy when we visit. The view from top is ok, but would not necessary undergo the demanding ascending next time. Maybe better to do it when not so busy. Back to Jeronymos monastrly later afternoon it was no queue at all, and we visited the wonderful cathedral and also the yard of the monastry. It really worths it. We did not have to pay, but I dont know if its because of we went there on Sunday, or its alltime free. Anyway, the monastry - and the church were great surprise at the end of our Lisbon trip."

I know it sounds silly when in Belem you have those sites around you but I simply went for the famous \"pasteis de Belem\", a Portuguese egg tart pastry, common in Portugal and generally called Past\u00e9is de Nata, created before the 18th century by the Catholic monks at the Mosteiro dos Jer\u00f3nimos in the civil parish of Santa Maria de Bel\u00e9m. Well, visit also those sites of course but do not miss these orgasmic creamy cakes at the Casa Past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m nearby!!! They made my day :-)"

I got a combined ticket for the tower and monastery for E8, the monastery was so beautiful and the guide book for each was just E1 and came in a variety of languages. The Padrao dos Descobrimentos has a really great exhibition on the forced Portuguese withdrawl from Goa in the 60's. I came accross a modern art museum attached to the Belem cultural centre. Free entry and I could easily have spent a whole day in there. The traditional pastries in Pasteis de Belem are a must in this area. There were a few beggars in the area but nothing unusual for a real tourist trap. The only dissappointment was the Archaeology museum , E5 in so the most expensive museum I visited in Lisbon and really doesn't compare to other archaelogy museums I have visited although the staff there were really nice."

Not sure it is worth the E5 admission as the main beauty of the place can be viewed for free externally. Once inside you can view the height restricted dungeon, and various rooms up a very narrow spiral staircase where it is difficult to pass others going in the opposite direction. However, do go and see it even if you do not go inside as it is one of the sights of Lisbon."

We took the tram 15 from Rossio Square which dropped us at the Jeronimos Monastry.Unfortunately there was a long queue and instead we decided to visit the Maritime Museum founded in 1863 by King Luis to promote maritime history. We then visited the Contemporary Art Museum which incidentally was free. Our visit would have been incomplete if we did not visit the Monumento dos Descobrimentos with sculptures of important historical figures such as King Manuel I, Vasco da Gama, Magellan and Cabral followed by a leisurely walk to Torre de Belem . We ended our day at the famous Pasteis de Belem and on our return had a close look at Ponte de 25 abril which made our visit complete."

Recently we saw a place for segway tours along the river which would be great fun.

The Berardo collection was a little disappointing as the collection had changed so i didn't get to see my Warhol check on the net to see current exhibits before making the trip, it is free though."

To visit the tower one must get off in \"centro cultural Belem\", walk for half a minute and there's the motorway. The street across cannot be walked because of the railway tracks; there is a bridge with many stairs for this purpose, where I don\u2019t remember seing any provisions made for people with special needs. So if you hate stairs you can get off at \"Belem\" instead, walk towards the tower and then walk back. It was Sunday around noon and of course there were plenty of tourists there. It's a five storey tower, and while being on the ground floor I saw a huge queue standing. I thought that there were just a lot of people there, waiting to go upstairs. Unfortunately this wasn\u2019t the case. The truth is that on the way to higher floors the path is very narrow, the spiral stairs being about 35 cm wide, this is the only way to the top, and that on the 35 cm stairs there were two queues, one going up and one going down. So bear in mind that sports shoes and 1,5 hour available for this visit are a must; no heavy equipment should be carried \u2013 better carry something that can be tied around the neck, like I did with my handbag- since both hands must be used while going downstairs. The tower is really small, when I arrived on the top there was not much of a view, but the view was not what I went there for anyway. The entrance is free until 14:00; at least on Sundays.Of course there are a number of shops selling souvenirs there, but at Rossio square I bought the same things at much cheaper prices. There is a small shop 10-20 meters before tram 15 last stop in Pra\u00e7a da Figueira, and I guess there must be plenty of souvenir selling stores around as well."

The church itself is amazing with soaring ceilings without any visable support. The cloisters are beautifull and architecture has to be seen to be believed. Belem is on the waterfront so there is a lovely cool breeze from the river, which makes a pleasant change from the centre of Lisbon. Belem tower is also an impressive building and there is an amazing monument on the waterfront called the Decembros monument. There is also river cruises available. We did one which took around two hours. It is nice to see Lisbon from the water and while the trip is not spectacular it is a good way to relax after so much walking. One interesting thing on the cruise was we went under a huge bridge which is a replica of the Golden Gate bridge. It is on two levels and an amazing piece of work."

However, it has been restored in a Disneyesque way, absurdly so. All the primitive stone has been cosmetically softened, so that it is devoid of any character, similar to a bad face lift. It is a problem that some buildings do suffer from too much \"conservation\", look at the Sistine chapel ceiling in the Vatican. Unfortunately, this is another. By removing warts and all, the tower ceases to have character, by its very nature, a rampart, to counter maritime aggression. Conservationists take heed."

I have used it many times but only sat once during the afternoon. You can avoid this by getting in on the first stop at Pra\u00e7a da Figueira. I found out last time that Trams queue one after another and get late because of all the people getting in and buying tickets individually. So, if you want to travel sitting to really enjoy the trip to Belem skip them until you get one where you can sit (there is one every 10-15 minutes).At Belem you must eat the famous pasteis the belem at the shop with lots of people outside. You will know it when you see it, but its worth it. There is lots to see in this area: Parks, museums, the tagus river, the arts exhibition. I would recommend spending a full day to really enjoy it.

The queue outside is for take aways - go in the shop to the left and keep walking - you go through room after room of cafes. We had 9 tarts, 3 coffess and a hot chocolate for 15euros! This place may be world famous but is still reasonable so locals still use it. You can order tubes of 6 pasteis to go whilst orderign your coffee - they are 6.30 euros for 6 pasteis.

It is a beautiful place with beautiful architecture (don't forget to look at the details of the sculptures) and interesting information and exhibition about Portuguese history. A ticket can be bought for the monastery and the tower of Belem for 10 euros which gives a little reduction.Then we had a little break sitting down in the pastry shop to enjoy the famous and delicious Portuguese custard tarts. Lovely tiles in the pastry shop. Then we carried on to the Monument of the discoveries. We hesitated to go up and finally decided to go : we did not regret it, because the view is lovely. Really worth it.Then we visited the Torre de Belem : pleasant place but it can be a bit complicated to go at the top as the staircase to reach it , is very narrow and it is a two-way staircase, people coming down meet the people coming up, one has to be really careful. Then enjoyed a delicious lunch in a little restaurant in Rua Vieira Portuense. Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of the restaurant but it was the one with beautiful flowers haging on top of the entrance. We ate outside and liked the fact that nobody came to \"fetch us\" when we were looking at the menu. The sardines were delicious, delicious, delicious ! 20 euros for 2 people : 1 main course each, drinks and cheese, bead and olives to start. Big portions.Then we ended the day visiting the coaches museum : another great place in the Belem district.We took our time to enjoy all this.

Got off at the lovely Monestry paid \u20ac7 to enter, a combo ticket for Belem tower and Monestry is \u20ac10. It is very ornate enjoyed our trip, well worth a visit. The area around the Monestry is lovely also. Had a look at Belem Tower and a great view of the 25th April Bridge. We then went to the top of the Monument to the Discoveries paid small fee to use the lift to the top. Great views. Tired and in need of coffee we headed to the famous Past\u00e9is de Nata, this is a Portuguese egg tart pastry which we really enjoyed in the restaurant. At \u20ac1 each we found room for a second one. The smell of the tarts - just amazing. Just to note another day we travelled by train to and from Estoril and the view from the train of Belem and the Monestry is lovely. I recommend this area."

I suggest a drop off at the Tower and then you can work your way back past all the sights. The Tower is a smaller example of the architecture that is in spades at the Monastery. and is 5 euros to get in. The views are great along the waterside. You can then walk around the Marina to the Monument to the Discoveries - don't miss the tiled map on the ground. You can then take an underpass under the road and train tracks to the Monastery. If you keep going along the road you come to the Cafe Past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m. It is worth having a walk around the inside labyrinth of rooms even if all the tables are taken - it does not feel comfortable or pleasant to actually have anything there.

One thing to note is that the stairs in the tower are narrow (think the narrow staircase leading to the top of a church tower) and when there are a lot of people moving from one level to the other, it might take some time to get up and down.

The bus stop to actual Belem tower is a good 20 mins walk, albeit a nice scenic stroll along the waterfront with great views of the bridge and Christ statue. The castle itself is quite cute, we didn't bother to pay to go inside or up as we had already seen great views from going up the christ statue.Worth a visit if you have time, but allow for a few transport hitches and take your time to get there and back just in case."

As you take in the scene, just cast your minds back to Portugals\u00b4s Age of Discovery; (ii) the splendid Jeronimos Monastery, built in the early 16th century to commemorate Vasco da Gama\u00b4s voyage to India, contains his tomb as well as those of a number of other notables (such as Fernando Pessoa, Portugal\u00b4s great poet); and (iii) the National Coach Museum, one of the finest of its type in the world, containing coaches from the 17th to the 19th centuries, including one which took the Spanish King Philip II from Madrid to Lisbon to view his newly-acquired bit of real estate (Portugal).

The bus journey was pretty quick and it was actually interesting as well. Got down near the Jeronimos Monastery. Looked extremely beautiful. Sadly it was closed when we reached Belem.. would have loved to visit this. We then walked down to the Discoveries monument - spectacular! You need to take a underground pathway to get to the other side of the road. You will find this on the main road close to Vasco Da Gama\u2019s statue.The whole area around the Discoveries monument looked extremely beautiful at night. Felt peaceful and nice to sit near the monument and listen to the waves lapping against the shore. You get a nice view of the Monument of Christ and also the 25 de Abril Bridge (the one that looks like Golden Gate Bridge).We had an excellent dinner at a restaurant close to the monument \u2013 Nosolo Italia. It\u2019s a pizzeria + gelato place by the docks. After a great dinner we walked back to the Jeronimos Monastery and took the bus back to Lisbon.

The Tower was already closed for the day, as was the Museum for Pop Art, but that was our fault for arriving late in the day on a weekend.

Don't forget to go to the Jeronimos Monastery, just over the road and a 5 minute walk or so. Beautiful inside, well worth a look. Don't bother with the nearby Botanical gardens.

There was a little market in the stunning gardens across from the Monastery where we found one of the few public conveniences in Lisbon. After a visit to the famous Pasties de Belem for a taste of their famous custard tarts we strolled further to the Belem Tower.The walk back to the centre of Lisbon was tough. We'd tried to take a train from Belem station but there was nowhere to purchase a ticket.Belem was a grand suburb of Lisbon that probably deserved far longer than we allowed, but didn't really have the atmosphere of Alfama or the Biarro Alto."

Great history but do some research about the site before you go as all the signs and interpretive materials are in Portuguese. In fact, that's pretty common throughout Portugal. Go early in the day when it is cool and less crowded. Also, the ancient stairwells are worn slick from hundreds of years of use so if you are elderly or physically challenged this one may well be too difficult. Also, NOT for small children in parent's arms. You can see the tower from outside fairly well if you decide not to pay the fee but it is a bit of a hike to get there.

Probably the most famous symbol of Lisbon (of course along with the famous Tram.28 and Elevador Santa Cruz), this monument looks gorgeous and not to be missed. There is nothing much special inside other than carrying examples of Manueline architectural elements, hence your visit will not probably take more than an hour even maybe shorter. Although the stairs are quite narrow and care must be taken, my advice is to climb and enjoy the view above, the picturesque view of Ponte 25 de Abril (25th\u00a0of April Bridge) is fascinating. One further \"budget\" advice is if you have a sunday in Lisbon, from 10:00 am till 14:00 all the monuments are free, so you can easily couple your Torre de Bel\u00e9m visit with Mosteiro dos Jer\u00f3nimos, Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos (Monument to the Discoveries) and Museu dos Coches (Coaches Museum). These four must-see attractions are really close and can be reached by Tram no.15 from Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio, one more practical budget advice is to buy a day ticket just for 5\u20ac (5,5\u20ac if you do not have a card) from one of the metro stations which is valid for 24h after the first usage, the trams are even more expensive if you pay inside (2.85\u20ac just for one way)."

There is an amazing bridge which looks like you are at the Golden Gate in SanFrancisco. There are a couple of horse drawn carriages available if you wish to have a ride - very popular with children.There are a couple of places to have lunch (or dinner) right on the water and as menus are posted outside you can choose one which suits your budget."

Given the limited time I had, I zoomed in on the Jeronimo Monastery and church, as well as grab a few pastries from the famous Pasteis de Belem. The church is free but definitely worth visiting if just to pay homage to Vasco da Gama whose tomb is inside. The entrance to the monastery is \u20ac7 if memory serves me well, and well worth the visit. As mentioned in another review, it is Manuelin architecture at its best. Somehow it projects beautiful calmness and light even though I visited on a crowded, hot summer day. As for Pasteis de Belem, do try the famous tarts. I had 3 all by myself! The line seems to be really long around 4pm but eases around 6pm. The staff is efficient, you can also dine in. Do try the savory pastries too. I had what looked like a fried Chinese bun (bao or pau) with chicken stuffing and it was really delicious. Apart from the number 15 tram, there are also other buses plying between Belem and Lisbon city. Apologies I can't remember as I have been traveling for 6 weeks in different cities, but do check as these could be faster than 15."

We visited the church - not the cloisters, and merely viewed the Monument and the Tower from the outside - this makes the trip free - but worth it. We brought a picnic lunch and ate it at the park area near the Tower, sitting on a ledge. We did stop for a beer at one of the riverside cafes, which was a nice way to finish the visit.We took the 15E tram (using our Viva Viagem card) - and due to the volume of people riding the tram and the heat of the day (95 degrees) we got a free sauna. Very uncomfortable ride, but mercifully only about 20 minutes long. Highly recommended as an inexpensive, enjoyable trip outside of Lisbon's city center."

The torre de Belem (Belem Tower) and mosteiro dos Jer\u00f3nimos (Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery) are such two iconic buildings. More recently, the 1940 built Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos pays homage to the discoverers and navigators that set sail to the unknown seas, to bring back spices, gold, lands and, unfortunately, slavery.Based on these iconic buildings, Belem flourishes. A constant in and out of tourists arriving in buses means that you'll never be alone. The more recently built Centro Cultural de Belem, CCB (Belem's Cultural Center) showcases many exhibits and performances, and the Museu da Marinha (Navy Museum), built in conjuction with the Astronomy Museum, allows a sneak peak into the caravels and sailing ships that allowed the Portuguese to become the pioneers of globalization.Close to the monastery, there are a couple of delicious pastry shops, one of which specializes in the Pastel de Belem, characterized by a sort of custard cream, served with cinnamon."

The ornamentation is rich in detail - once again rather unusual for a fortification - but I'm not sure how much of these details are original and what has been added later.A few practicalities: Entrance 5 EUR. Belem Tower opens at 10 - be there before 11 - there will be quite crowded later on... And the staircase to the top is very narrow for 2 way traffic. Take the tram all the way to Largo da Princesa - take the last road before the tram stop to get to the pedestrian bridge over the railroad tracks. After your visit, you can walk back to the other sights in Belem. On OUR way back to central Belem we 'discovered' a \u00a010 days old cafe named 'Descobre' (discover in Portuguese) - funny...

The Padrao dos Descobrimentos was also very impressive to view from exterior. Though I took the elevator up the Padrao, the view was nice, though not a must do. For a quick visit to Belem, could probably do it in 2.5 - 3 hours. I also did have Pasteis de Belem (flaky custard tart) at the famous Antiga Confeitaria - it was very good, since they serve it hot (freshly prepared)."

First, we took the tram number 15E to the stop Mosteiro Jer\u00f3nimos, which is right at the monastery.The monastery is a lot more impressing outside than inside. I think the outside was the most impressive of the sights I saw in Lisbon. The best part inside was the church of Santa Maria, which can be visited without a fee. A combined ticket for the monastery itself and the tower of Belem costs 10 euros, so even though the the monastery is not the highlight here, the cost is so low, that it's still worth going there.After the monastery, we had lunch in Belem, and then hopped again on the tram and traveled to the stop Largo da Princesa, which is quite close to the tower of Belem. The tower itself is pretty small and also this one looks better outside than inside. If you are claustrophobic, don't bother going in. There are prison cells, that are quite low, and the doorways are even lower. The walk up to the tower is on a narrow winding staircase with 2-way traffic."

I was only planning on getting one since I'm on a diet, but something prompted me to get the six-pack and I ate the whole thing. It became my breakfast and lunch, and was simply one of the best pastries I have ever tasted. Such a nice, crispy shell and wonderful, sweet egg custard inside the shell. Amazing, and definitely the best custard tart I had while I was in Portugal. And that's saying a lot, because I tried a lot of them :)The monastery was very crowded but worth the visit. Beautiful and huge. I also visited the Monument to the Discoveries - great pictures if you go to the top - and then went to the Tower of Belem (small, and a bit of a disappointment if you ask me). I thought that Belem was a good half-day trip. People with interest in coaches and maritime museums may enjoy the whole day there, but the monastery, pastry shop, monument and tower were enough for me in one day."

For us the Monastery by far had the most beautiful sites and is great place to get some good pictures. We were lucky enought to be in the Monastery while several music students were there giving a concert. After leaving the Monastery we walked over to Past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m and spent 30 minutes in line to get a few custard tarts....not that we wanted just custard tarts - we also wanted chocolate croissant's but the person serving us spoke no english and we didn't speak portugues so we ended up with just custard tarts. After that we walked along the water front Belem Tower and then further along to Belem Tower. Finally we ended up walking back thru the park toward Past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m to find a restaurant for lunch. All in all an enjoyable half day of site seeing."

The fascinating area of Belem in lovely ilsbon has much to offer, an amazing Monastery, the ornate Torre de Belem dominating the harbour Entrance, and the lovely waterfront area. My personal favourite is the magnficent Monument to the Discoveries looking triumphantly out over the Atlantic Ocean.It is styled like the prow of a proud sailing vessel, with the brave explorers peering out to sea, led by the manificent figure of Henry the Navigator, holding a miniature sailing caravel. He is closely followed by Vasco de Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, and many other eminent Portuguese explorers , map makers, and writers, many clutching the tools of their trades. Both sides are carved with these wonderful figures, It is built of polished pale stone, stands 50 metres tall , and was opened in 1960 to commemorate the 500 year anniversary of the death of Henry the Navigator, the driving force behind Portugal's leadership in maritime exploration. The Monument can be climbed by lift, and the top affords magnificent views over the city, the waterfront, and the huge marble world exploration map at the foot of the building."

Do not forget that on Mondays most of these places are closed. A visit to Belem is not complete without tasting the pastries at Antiga Confeitaria de Belem. Get your pastries!"

During out Feb 2012 Lisbon visit we spent the Sunday morning visiting Bel\u00e9m (Sunday is a good choice because entrance to museums, including the Bel\u00e9m Tower, is free). We took the 15E tram from the Praca de Figuera near Rossio and got off at the stop past San Jeronimos monastery and then walked to the tower. We walked back to San Jeronimos monastery next and visited the Cloister, the church had service at that moment. We spent some time browsing through a flea market in the area to the left of the garden in front of the monastery. The \"Monument to the Discoveries\" is across the busy road, so we saw it from a distance. Finally we also went through the National Coach Museum (it was free after all :-) and had lunch at the os Jeronimos restaurant, followed by caf\u00e9 con leche and Pasteis de Bel\u00e9m (popular Portuguese egg tart pastry, called pasteis de nata elsewhere). Then we took 15E tram back to Rossio. All in all, it was an excellent way to spend a Sunday morning.Remember to buy a 5 Euro \"7 Colinas\" pass for metro and tram, see my blog http://nbtmv.blogspot.com/2012/04/visiting-lisbon-portugal.html for details."

Apparently, half the tourists in Lisbon had made the same choice, along with about half a dozen of school groups. Because the staircases inside the tower are very narrow, what could have been an easy climb that could be completed in 5 minutes, turned into close to an hour of waiting on the 4 or 5 levels of the tower. Even without the wait, I was unimpressed with the views from the tower. The interiors were not much better. However, the tower is a gem to look at from the outside. Consider walking along the river from the Monument of the Discoveries towards the Tower and just admiring the view as you get closer. The Tower is definitely worth seeing, but not necessarily from the inside."

Then went back into the town centre to the famous bakery - definitely worth a visit. You can go inside and sit down, don't be fooled by the small exterior, it opens up to be huge inside with many tables. Or you can get food from the counter and stroll around Belem if its a nice day. Their hot chocolate is to die for. Must try the \"lisbon\" cake, its like a sweet pastry custard tart that is sold everywhere for around 1 euro or less.Ventured to the Palace, but you can't go inside and it is guarded by 3 people, (1 with a gun) so it is very much not a \"visitable\" palace! Went to the botanical gardens, you have to pay 2 euro entry but if its a nice day its worth it. Loads of birds roaming around and peacocks and even turtles.

The Coach museum is surprisingly interesting; a new, larger museum is under construction and may be able to display even more vehicles when it opens. There is also the Monument to the Discoveries (which we didn't reach), an archeology museum and extensive parks. It's an easy ride on Trolley 15E (watch out for pickpockets!) and all of the sights are within walking distance (it probably takes about 20 minutes to get to Belem Tower from the Coach Museum). We'd recommend getting the Lisbon Card for this visit -- it covers most of the sights as well as the Trolley."

It's a 10 minute walk from the tram across a pedestrian bridge which runs over a highway and train track. The tower itself is like a fairy tale, shining white, rising from the water, with intricate details. The original tower was farther off shore, but more recently reclaimed land made entrance via a footbridge possible. The entrance fees are modest, and well worth seeing such an interesting tower. The lowest level was a storehouse and prison, and you can't stand to full height if you are of medium adult height or taller. Worth a peek, but just for a few minutes. The real treat (in our opinion) was the courtyard level, where you can first emerge out of doors to see the views up and down the water, including the big bridge, the river traffic, and the shoreline. (Unfortunately the other side of the shore line seems to be mostly power plants, but the Lisbon/Belem side is nice)The tower has many upper levels reached by a narrow stone spiral staircase. The stairs were not overly difficult to navigate, except when pedestrian traffic became congested in both directions. However, we were impressed by humanity -- with no system in place, people chose to wait on each floor to allow groups to come up first before proceeding down, thus minimizing the two-way traffic on the staircase. The upper floors had interesting views, as well as a brief film on the history of the site. You can also gain an appreciation of what it would be like to live there by visiting the many floors.Word of caution -- the stairs are not for the infirm. One member of our party chose to remain downstairs while we visited above. Our 4 year old child was able to navigate reasonably well. Also, the windows were open on each floor so we could see the view, but this also let the wind in, and it was very windy. Dress appropriately for the weather. (And not the best place to visit in the rain, as the view and the outdoor bits are the best!)Allow sufficient time to take lots of photos -- the tower is quite photogenic, with interesting architecture, statues, etc. Don't miss the rhino gargoyle viewable from an alcove in the tower -- our son loved it!"

Important: If you are claustrophobic, DO NOT go up the middle stone staircase, or if you must up the courage, make sure to do only one flight at a time and give yourself lots of time to chill on the next level. Do not attempt to cover 2 or more flights as it\u2019s extremely narrow and does not accommodate two direction traffic well at all. At times people may actually stop in the middle of it because it\u2019s so crowded to sort out who\u2019s going down and who\u2019s going up. There are a few windows in it, but not many, so be mindful that you don\u2019t end up getting stuck in the windowless part.A neat thing to do when it's not terribly crowded is to shut yourself (and your significant other?) in one of the turrets on the main or second level that have doors that close fully and just sit in there and watch the river, the tide, people on shore. It's a cool feeling."

I went on a Sunday and it was so crowded that several buses/trams went by before I could get on one (leaving from Cais do Sodr\u00e9) and I had the same problem returning to Lisbon in the afternoon. If time is critical, I recommend taking the train.Apart from the crowds, Belem was a lovely city. I especially enjoyed the Monastery and trying the local pastries. The area seemed very safe and I didn't feel worried wandering around alone. It was also very easy to navigate because the sights are along a single, straight stretch on either side of the train lines."

Then we walked over to the Jeronimos Chapel, which has a great view on Belem and the river Tejo, but was unfortunably closed.

Finally we visited the Mosteiro dos Jeronimos, an absolut must see, when in Belem. The beautifully decorated facade, the church with its impressive columns and the absolutely wonderful cloister are worth the long tram ride from the city center. To give our feet some rest and to please our stomach we ended our tour of Belem at the caf\u00e9 'Pasteis de Belem', where you really do get the best custard tarts in the whole wide world.

Almost faint in disbelief at how tasty the tarts are, with warm gooey custard and super-flaky pastry. Head outside into sunshine, wonder what the tarts are really made of if they can improve the weather so greatly and cross over to the monastery.View the church and the monastery cloisters with their intricate and ornate stone work, before heading towards the Tejo to climb up the Tower of Discoveries to get a view back across towards the monastery and the rest of Belem. Follow this up with a wander towards the Torre de Belem, climbing up the tower to learn a little of the history of both it and the periods of Lisbon's history. Finish up by heading back to the tram to weave your way back into the middle of Lisbon.A definite must-see area of Lisbon with a number of things to do, see and eat all within easy walking distance of one another - if you do one thing in Lisbon, make it visiting Belem, if only to eat a Pateis de Belem tart!"

The Mosteiro dos Jeronimos, huge, beautiful, impossible to imagine how many hours of work went into building the building alone, let alone carving all the Manueline work. Paid for by the Portuguese empire / spice / gold trade. Adjancent to the river, Torre de Bel\u00e9m - great view of Belem & Lisbon, amazing sculpture / carvings on it's river-front \"prow\", and Casa Past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m, where you can take a break, enjoy a Bika & a couple of Past\u00e9is. Our waiter, who seemed to have been doing his job there for 30+ years, was great - we we ordered 2 Bika and 4 Past\u00e9is and asked if that was too many / too few of the Past\u00e9is, and he said \"1 may not be enough, but more than 2 is definitely too many\" with a slight look of \"don't be a silly glutton\".

The 28 bus will take you back to downtown Lisbon when you are ready."

It is so important to the history of Portugal and Brasil because, from this place the three caravels left to later discover Brazil. The Mosteiro dos Jeronimos right in front, is a portuguese architectural masterpiece and deserves a detailed visit. Not to mention the famous Belem pastries (sorry to say I found not so good). In order to visit and enjoy all the area attractions, maybe one day is not enough. I suggest that when you get tired, you walk along the riverside up to the Santo Amaro Docks and have lunch (or dinner) at one of the many good restaurants in the area. It is one of the nicest walkways in Lisbon."

The stop is just a few blocks from the tower and then you need to climb up and down an overpass to cross the street. I believe there is an underpass as well but it was blocked by construction when we visited. My husband climbed to the top of the tower and said it really wasn't worth it; very crowded with lots of people trying to maneuver one set of windy stairs in both directions. If you're facing the water, to the right of the tower is a little monument where we happened to catch a changing of the guards ceremony. I don't think many people know about this as there were fewer than 10 other people watching. We saw the ceremony at 1300 hours on a Sunday. There are restrooms right by this monument that cost 50 cents Euro to use and are fairly clean.We then walked to the Monument of the Discoveries and took the elevator to the top. My husband said the view was actually better than from the top of the tower without having to fight crowds and climb the steps, so I'd recommend this. If you have taken a yellow bus tour, save your ticket stub as it gets you a discount on the elevator ride and is also good for riding the tram all day. We then walked back down rather than taking the elevator back down.We had lunch at a restaurant right next to the Monument of the Discoveries. It was very crowded but we still got seated right away at an outside table. The food was very good and relatively inexpensive for the area.From there we walked across the street, using the underpass, to the monastery area. There was a flea market going on in the park in front of the monastery which was nice to walk through and browse.At the monastery, we visited only the chapel, which is free. The chapel is definitely worth a visit and you can see the tomb of Vasco de Gama.Just outside the monastery, we took the #15 tram back to our hotel area.This was a great place to spend a good chunk of a day. There are pathways along the water which makes for a really nice stroll."

The Torre de Belem is charming, but a long, unforgiving walk from the Monastery (past abandoned warehouses, adjacent to a dual carriageway). Decent loos in the Centro Cultural. A simple tram ride from the city centre, but tram frequencies have been reduced in times of austerity, and so you may find you have quite a wait. I confess to not eating a pastel de nata from the famous shop, but the queue was out onto the pavement, and I love custard tarts but that just seemed a waste of time."

We then went to the Carriage Museum. We were not expecting much but were completely surprised how interesting it was and how sumptious the coaches were. It was also moving to see the coach in which King Carlos and his son were assasinated, including the bullet holes. It was then nice to get out into the park with a charming market. We of course bought Belem tarts from the the belem bakery which had long but fast moving queues all day. We then went down to the river edge and climbed, for a small fee (there is also a lift), the monument to the explorers - impressive in a bit of a kitsch way but the kids loved it. We walked up to, but not in to, the Tower of Belem (thought the entry fee a bit steep for what was described as being most impressive from the outside). Also visited the Presidential palace - quite interesting. Took the bus back to Lisbon as cheaper and did not need exact change like on the tram."

It's very easy to reach via the train (10 minutes or so from the main station) and everything is easy to find. The Tower is about a 10 -15 minute walk from the Monestary along level ground. Be forewarned: the Tower involves quite a bit of climbing in crowded stairways."

Belem is not just the most famous Tower of Lisbon and Portugal but also one of the most beautiful districts in whole Lisbon and one of the most visited.The Tower of Belem classified UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983, recalls the architectures of the former portuguese cities in Morocco (it reminded me Skala du Port in Essaouira then I discovered that it was built by the same architect). Nearby there's another World Heritage site: The Monastery of the Hieronymites (Mosteiro dos Jeronimos), one of the most prominent monuments of the Manueline-style architecture (which is the Portuguese late-Gothic) in Lisbon.In the same district, one can find the Padrao dos Descubrimentos which I will review separately.Don't forget a sweet stop at the \"Antiga Confeitaria de Bel\u00e9m\" to try the famous \"Pasteis de Bel\u00e9m\". You'll be more than satisfied!"

When inside you can go virtually all over the Torre which surprisingly reveals itself to have about 5 storeys. A word of warning though: the stone stairs wind up a narrow tower and are for two-way traffic. This can lead to long delays in either direction and is also potentially quite dangerous - in fact I was surprised that safety regulations did not mean enforcing a control on people to give alternate one-way pedestrian flows. It is not for those with walking difficulties nor those who suffer with claustrophobia. Once at the top there are great views of the River Tagus, the 25th April Bridge, the Padroa des Descobrimentos and Belem itself. You can certainly appreciate that this Tower was built with defence in mind, especially with reference to the stairs !"

I now know he is a big deal, but wow, great stuff.

Get the Lisboa card at any TI office (one across the avenue from Jeronimos)--it saved us a lot on museums, train to Sintra, etc. That famous pastry shop with the line out the door, close to the Jeronimos & Coach museum: worth it.

Here are just some of them:Mosteiro dos Jeronimos: A monastery started in 1501 to commemorate the successful voyage of Vasco da Gama to find a trade route to India. While the facade is ornate, boasting a large cast of characters both religious and secular (e.g., Henry the Navigator), the nave is surprisingly austere, with walls of plain stone blocks. This is offset by the carved pillars that support the vaulted ceiling. Many tombs are housed therein, including royalty and -- yes -- Vasco da Gama. The highlight for me, however, is quite the most magnificent cloister I\u00b4ve ever encountered -- a two-story cloister enclosed by ornate pillars and a series of lacy triple arches, all carved from pale gold stone.Maritime Museum: The pride of this museum is a vast hall full of royal barges. The most ornate of these is a heavily-gilded monster from the early 18th century, manned by 80 oarsman and last used in 1957 to transport Queen Elizabeth II on a state visit. Museum of Coaches: A festival of coaches, litters, sedan chairs, and accoutrements thereto. The oldest is a 1619 coach that brought Philip III of Spain to Lisbon on a state visit. Palace of Ajuda: The interior of the palace is semi-standard for a palace decorated in the 1860s. Unusual features are a marble conservatory and a room full of ceramics, including ceramic-fronted furniture, a ceramic mirror surround, and a ceramic chandelier. My favorite room was the small but classy music room. There were two bedrooms for the king, one of which was surprisingly austere, with a single bed. Most unusual was the king\u00b4s bathroom, boasting brand-new, state-of-the-art 1860s indoor plumbing. I have never before seen a flush toilet with two holes -- a regular-size one and a small one for use as a urinal.Belem Tower: Built as a defensive tower, but boasting magnificent architecture in the Manueline style, which combines Moorish, Gothic, and Renaissance elements. There is a small feature tucked away at the base of a tower that is most unusual -- a stone rhinoceros, thought to be the first depiction of a rhinoceros in Europe."

They are pretty easy to spot. You will see them board midway during the ride; they tend to travel in twos - one to cause a distraction, and one to steal. They will also stay near the doors for a quick getaway. Keep your bags, backpacks in hand, and if possible, wear a long jacket that covers your pockets. Also, avoid using your iPad or cell phone if near a door.OK, enough of the safety tips... Belem is a fantastic, well-preserved, and beautiful part of Lisbon. Everything is so close together and well-run. It makes for a perfect day trip.Start at the Coach Museum: this is better to do early, because in its current under-sized location, big tour groups will ruin your chance to see anything or take decent photos, although you can overhear some interesting tidbits. If in a rush, just do the first 2 rooms with the most impressive coaches and skip the upstairs (equipment, tools, portraits of royals). You can do this in 20-30 minutes easily.The Casa Pasteis de Belem is a must-visit pastry shop/cafe. See my separate review on it. If you don't try these world-famous custard tarts, you are crazy.The highlight of Belem is the Monastery of Jeronimos (1hr). Beautiful architecture and lots of space. If you have a Lisboa Card, you can cut right to the entrance and bypass the ticket line. See everything. On the day I visited, it closed at 14h00 - check the times before you see anything else in Belem. The cathedral next door is nice, but it's pretty standard compared to the other churches you'll see in Lisbon. The church is skippable if in a rush.The Monument to the Discoveries (15 min) is a big disappointment. They closed down the exhibits and the film on Lisbon. All that's there now is a view from the top for 2.50 Euros, and when it's windy it's very scary. You can get a similar view from the Tower de Belem, and that view is free with a Lisboa Card. Take some photos from the outside, and move on.The Maritime Museum (30-45 mins) is quite good for anyone interested in boats. I ran in to avoid a rainstorm and was pleasantly surprised. Most exhibits are scale models of old ships, but there are actual barges and planes in the final room. A good option on a rainy day, but skippable if doing Belem in a half-day.Torre de Belem (Belem Tower) is historic, beautiful. Again, cut to the front of the line with your Lisboa Card. The Tower has a nice view from the top. It's at the opposite end of town from the Coach Museum. Catch the 15E trolley back to the city here to ensure you get a seat.My main tip would be to visit Belem when it is not raining. I went during a very heavy rain, and it was miserable. I couldn't even take photos of the outside of the monastery, and going to the top of the Belem Tower or Monument of the Discoveries was very scary and dangerous (no good railings).Belem is a definite must-do day trip, and you can even get back to Lisboa for 15h with a stash of the world's best custard tarts!"

It is worth waiting for the next tram, if you will be at the front of the next queue, as the trip takes 40 mins. You will need to get on at the start of the ride! With a day ticket you can get on and off as you please so you can see the museums and monuments around Belem, of which there are plenty and well worth the ride."

Being from the United States, I had not seen places like Lisbon, Belem, Sintra, or Cascais, and Belem was fantastic in every way. The pastry shop, the Tower, and the museums (within the gigantic church) were sights I will always treasure.One cannot adequately describe the massive sizes of these sights...huge and beyond your imagination, until you walk beside them, and enter within their walls. I have been fortunate in having visited Belem, reading upon the history of the explorers andworld leaders of their times, in expanding their understanding and knowledge of what was beyond the edges of what they thought earth was....Vasco de Gama, Columbus...great experience to walk on places these insightful men once walked....History continued."

Having most of the day before us, we took a taxi from the Rossio Praca to the Belem District. Saw the Tower of Belem -- great 15th Century river island fort, distinctive Moorish architectural details--, then walked throught the Monastery of Jeronimos -- monument to Vasco de Gama -- and its wonderful Clositers... maybe our best site in Portugal. Serene, peaceful, beautiful. Visited Monument of the Discoveries. Lunch was grilled fish at Restaurtane Os Jeronimos. We took streetcar 15E back to our Fugeria Praca and our hotel. Good 1/2 day outing. 2. Having an afternoon available, we took streetcar 15E from Fugeria Praca to the Belem District. Bought reduced rate streetcar pass at the outlet on Rossio Praca. We went back especially to see the Maritime Museum, which we missed on our first visit. Museum is a wonderful collection of maritime artifacts, ship models, life-sized boats, and luxury royalty barges. Had Pastries at the touristy local pastries shop, but were not impressed."

Little did we know, the Tower of Belem is quite a walk from the monastery, with little shade on a sunny hot day, so I would suggest taking the tram/bus to get there. It probably only merits somewhere between a 2- and 3-star rating. But you can get some beautiful shots. Pastis of Belem is worth going just to say you've been there and ate their custard pastry. We went late in the afternoon, so had no problem finding a table. However, I found the custard way too sweet for my taste. I thought I had better in Hong Kong and Macau.

Now on to the Tower, it is interesting, but the crowds were so thick when we were there that we could barely move. We were there on a Sunday which is a free day so that probably added to it. However when we arrived in the main square there was some sort of ceremonial event going on with military dressed regiments, music, men on horseback, and two untameable rotwilers. That was interesting to watch. There was also a flea market in the park which had mostly junky stuff and gypsies begging. The waterfront was lovely though and we enjoyed walking along it to and from the tower."

Along with the Monument to the Discoveries, the Belem tower is probably one of the most popular images of Lisbon, and it does not disappoint with it's intricate carvings, and beautiful setting on the harbour. You can explore the old dungeons beneath the tower, climb to the top for a great view over Belem, or just admire the tower itself. If you visit on a Sunday before 2pm, it's free!"

When it\u2019s foggy, you won\u2019t be able to see anything from the tower, you\u2019ll also have difficulties seeing the tower itself. It\u2019s extremely crowded and I suppose this issue should be regulated somehow. You can climb the tower using a very steep and narrow staircase. The effect is that hundreds of people try to go upstairs and downstairs simultaneously (some even with babies in their arms) and the situation is getting rather dangerous sometimes. The tower is pretty nice and I liked the carvings in stone, but I didn\u2019t really see anything spectacular nor especially extraordinary there. I\u2019m sure there\u2019re more interesting places in Lisbon and if you don\u2019t have too much time, I\u2019d suggest skipping it."

Then there is lots to see and do around it as well, military museum right beside it and then the Discoveries monument is a bit further down the river. Easier to take a care and drive down the the next parking lot as a small harbor will prevent you from easily walking there. Across the street - blocked my train tracks is the Monastary.Note that the Tower is closed on Mondays."

The tower is not big, and there is not a large amount to see, but the atmosphere and character of the structure were charming and fun.The detail in the building's exterior was a surprise. Most of the ancient buildings we had seen in Lisbon were plain and functional. The stairs going up are super narrow, so you have to make sure no one is coming the opposite way. The rooms were bare and not too interesting. They would have benefited from more information about what they were used for or what they may have looked like at the time they were used.The tower top is simple: just a square with 4 lookout points, but hanging out the window, looking out over the water gives a great sense of the history. It is a quick sight to see. We were in and out pretty fast without rushing."

We also visited the Discover's Monument and Belem Tower. Jeronimos Monastery is very impressive! And you have to have a photo together at Discover's Monument. Belem Tower is small but also a must see place. Belem does give one an interesting perspective of Portugese history. The Portugese were the first Europeans to really venture out accross the oceans to Africa, America, & Asia. Our modern world does begin with the Portugese sea voyages started in the 1400's. Belem is the place to remind us of all that."

The river views as it flows toward the Atlantic, the bridges, the Discoverer's Monument, the monastary, coaches museum, and more and you can easily spend the better part of a day if you see it all. Make sure you stop at the Pasteis de Belem for the most famous custard treats in Portugal. You can find them all over the country but they are supposed to be at their best here in Belem. Their cafe has been enlarged over the years and has room for hundreds and is often crowded but you can usually find a table if you walk around a bit. And if you only order one you might wish you had another."

This is a local pastry shop that has been in existence since 1837 and serves the most wonderful custard pastries, pasteis de nata...along with a surprisingly well priced menu of lunch items. We spent a week in Lisbon and visited Pasteis de Belem more than once just for the pastries. If you go, it is located about a half block east of the monastery, just past the bus and trolley stop. Use the door on the left and go inside to sit and eat. Surprise yourself and walk all the way through to see just how huge this place is, then be surprised at how quickly and efficiently you are served."

The tower had great views from the top and is very well preserved. The Maritime Museum has some great exhibits on Portugese maritime history including full size royal barges. It is definately worth the 1.50E entrance fee. Beware the No 15 Tram back to Lisbon can be a bit crowded and make you feel like sardines."

It's a nice, quiet area including the Monastery of Jeronimos, the Museum of Coaches, the Marine Museum, the Discoverers' Monument and many others.The Monastery is an impressive building which is worth visiting by all means; it's difficult to describe how beautiful it is. The tower of Belem resembles the monastery in terms of architecture and design; beware that the wind is very strong up there in the tower.The Museum of Coaches is again an interesting place to see; there is an impressive collection of royal coaches, very well preserved or restored, dating back as far as the XVIth century up to the XIXth century.The Naval Museum has a good collection of various items related to navigation but the attraction you must not miss is the collection of old (royal) barges.All these attractions are within a walking distance from one another and from the train station. You can also have a walk along the river side and admire the boats anchored in the harbour."

We bought the pamphlet, and even that didn't do much other than label the rooms - but no info on what those rooms were used for our how they may have been decorated. It's empty inside - except the overrun of people. It was like a cattle call, particularly when everyone is coming and going through the same doors. And the stairs! Up and down the tower shares one spiral staircase - one NARROW staircase - very difficult to navigate. I do have to admit that the view from the top was nice, however."

I thought the Torre de Belem was interesting, but extremely crowded, not particularly evocative of Portugal's past, and in my humble opinion more attractive from the outside than from the inside. It could be made a lot more interesting if there were stories provided inside that gave some context to the Tower and interesting tales of things that had happened there. A small exhibit discussing Lisbon's coastal defenses in particular, defending it from the Drakes of the this world would be particularly interesting. If you are going there because you are also visiting the Moansterio San Jeronimo, I would much rather recommend the interesting archeological museum right next to the monastery."
