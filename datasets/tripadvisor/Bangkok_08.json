Ever since it has opened I have been visiting BHAWA SPA on a regular basis and I have never missed the opportunity of having a 3-4 hour session in this SPA while in Bangkok. I have never been disappointed. Reservations in advance are definitely recommended, as most of times they are sold out. The whole staff and management are extremely friendly and professional, with lots of attention to details. Over the years they have expanded and added rooms. Now also the annex is completed with a direct access. I would like to thank for the services rendered and I am already looking forward to my next visit."

Masseur's skills are well but her time management is not good, as spent more time at the back, my front is barely touch. Routines on feets are not even, one with a bit more touch on sole and skip the other one. None of toes, fingers or palm been touched. Finishing towel at my back is cold. I think they can do better. I heard from Bhawa investors are from Divana, Bhawa masseur's skills are slightly better but Divana seems to be more consistent"

They brought us into a very cute room where we could be together. We had time for a quick shower since it was so hot before putting on the Thai clothing. The Thai massage is no oil and a lot more stretching then a traditional Swedish massage. For me it was great after hours of long flights. Both therapists were wonderful and the price was about a total of $120 USD for both of us. What a great place. We would highly recommend. "

This is the first spa I have been to in Thailand in the two weeks I have been here that asked for my health history, the type of pressure I would like to have and the area of my body I would like to avoid or focus more on. The Spa was very very very clean. I had the mediation program which offer a foot soak & scrub, aromatherapy massage and warm aroma bath (the smell made me want to live there forever). Everything was so perfect. I can honestly say after being in Thailand for two weeks, receiving massages just about every single day this was the BEST SPA ! I promise you won't be upset! After our massage they even had fruit and tea served while we waited for our uber in which the women walked us to our car and thank us again. We paid around 2700 baht and it was so worth it !!!

Your surroundings are dark wood opulence, the dimly lit atmosphere is calm and serene.We had a couples room, but were able to have different varieties on our treatment - which were both essentially thai massages, we got to have our own twist.In summary, it's a luxurious experience, where every detail is well thought-through from the welcome to treatments.

We contacted them a week before my planned trip and my desired timeslot was already filled.The spa was tucked away in a small street opposite the U.S. Embassy and a short 5-10mins walk from BTS. Once we entered, we were greeted with a Pandan drink and cold towel which was nice. There were three other couples arriving for the same time slot and they were able to attend to us promptly.The massage room itself was spacious and nicely decorated. But the floor was sticky and oily, likely due to the constant oil treatment it gets which made it a tad icky to walk on especially after a shower. My massage lady was competent and she did refer to the preference form I filled in. But hubby's massage lady didn't seem to give enough emphasis to the problem area he indicated in his form. His massage lady also didn't give him the herbal compress massage which we had booked and paid for. When I highlighted that to the manager, she apologized for the miscomm and to our surprise, she waived the entire cost of both our treatments. I was expecting a discount for the lapse or at most waiver of his treatment. So, kudos for the service recovery! "

But my mom and sister said they enjoyed the treatment a lot, actually better than one they had at intercontinental samui. what I can say is it depends on who you have."

            "review": "Great Spa Experience at an affordable price. The spa is well hidden at a very quite area but right at the heart of Bangkok. Very convenient location right around the Phleon Chit BTS station The property outside and inside is beautiful. I did the Pampering package which includes a scrub/mud and oil massage. The whole experience has been nice. My therapist is really good. I picked \"strong\" for the pressure although it comes on a bit too harsh on me from time to time. I guess it really varies as I picked \"strong as well the other day at Divana Divine and I was completely fine. I can't say I really enjoy the harsh bit which literally pains me quite a lot but I guess that's how they loosen you muscle up. The body mud smells nice and really smooth your skin a lot.One thing to improve is the staff especially the receptionist in general was not as attentive and note to the details as much as what I had experience the other day at Divana Divine. I was a bit surprised that the reception hasn't introduced all these different type of body oil and body mud at all and just ask me to pick what i like. But in general, the whole experience is good and I will recommend to friends who stay at the area."

She was very respectful and not once did I feel uncomfortable I immediately booked another session! one of the girls walked me down the dark driveway at the end! Lovely - well worth the money!"

It was about 3 hours long and we booked separate rooms. I was expecting something similar to a Hamam scrub I have gotten in Turkey or Morocco, I should have asked some questions before booking because the scrub was nothing like I expected. It was more of a rub then a take off several layers of dead skin scrub that I am used to. It was pleasant but not fabulous. The Thai massage takes some getting used to for me. It's deep (or at least it feels deep) and I felt like I never really relaxed because I was bracing myself for painful pressure. I asked several times for the masseuse to lighten up but she never got it quite right for my comfort zone. What can I say, I am a novice and a wuss I guess. The hot compresses were really nice after the massage, I really relaxed during that treatment. The treatment room was very clean and stocked with all the necessary amenities down to a safe for valuables. My husband enjoyed his treatment but he's also a go along to get along kinda guy."

I loved the small touches, like a small snack of bananas and fruit juice halfway through the massage, the rose petals in the bathtub, and the facial treatment was probably my favourite part of the whole spa session. The meal after was a nice addition also, with fruit, juice and Pad Thai. The staff were so lovely also. Would recommend this place to anybody looking for a luxurious way to spend a day."

My husband wasn't able to book a spot. Anyway, when I got there, I asked again for my husband and they told me they were fully booked. I asked to be put on the waiting list but unfortunately they said they just didn't have any capacity. The next day, I decided to ask Okura to call Bhawa Spa. Lo and behold, when Okura concierge called, Bhawa did have an opening! Bhawa is aesthetically beautiful with welcoming staff and the massage services were top notch. They have signs to direct you to their spa (see photo) so it's relatively easy to find. Book early if you want a spot!"

The spa we took was a 4-hour one, called Royal Jelly Spa Absolute Rejuvenation. Within this 4 hours spa, too much time was spent on body scrub. The massage lady left me uncover inside a cold air-conditioning room while she was getting some warm water/ oil for body scrub. This happened almost 10 times during body scrub. Besides, the oil massage time was too short. I doubt if there was one full hour for this. The massage woman kept on leaving me in and out. After massage the left leg, she left me few minutes for preparing the bath water, and then my right leg. The oil massage was interrupted many times, very annoying. They spent most time in preparing water instead of focusing on massage. I hope this situation can be improved. This never happens in other spa s that I have tried before."

Aside from being consistently ranked within the top 10 of TripAdvisor's Spa & Wellness in Bangkok, Bhawa was recommended to my family by some friends. Having heard these wonderful things about Bhawa, we saved it for the last day of our trip to Bangkok, hoping to end on a high note.My mother and I picked the 4-hour royal jelly rejuvenation spa package. It started off fine in the first 2 hours with the scrub, the body mud and the milky bath with lime and flower petals etc. But then things went horribly wrong during the massage. I could tell that my masseuse was tired. She was applying uneven pressure upon each stroke, and worse still, it felt completely different on my left and right legs. So I tried my best to communicate with her. Eventually that failed and I asked for a change of masseuse. The second masseuse came along and perhaps she was told that I wanted more pressure, so she really went for it. I repeatedly told her to be \"softer please\" and that it was \"painful\". At one point I believe she climbed onto the massage bed, pressed her whole body weight onto the small of my back with her palm, and jumped down from the bed. As a result, there was a severe sharp pain in my lower back, so much that I had to stop immediately. I could still walk but the pain didn't go away, so I asked for help from the reception. The receptionist asked me to \"calm down\" and tried to send in yet another masseuse to do a \"check-up\" for me, but at that point, given the abruptness and intensity of my pain, it was best to seek medical attention. The receptionist then told me that the nearest English-speaking hospital is 1-hour away - an exaggeration which I do not appreciate. (They tried to explain that it was after taking the traffic into account. But when I asked how far it was from my hotel, the receptionist said \"very far\", which was not true. It seemed to me that she could have been trying to hush it up.) I insisted on calling my own hotel and was informed by hotel staff that there is a hospital 15 minutes away. The owner of Bhawa came and drove us to that hospital. I was diagnosed with a back contusion and muscle spasm as a result of massage, and was discharged with anti-inflammatory drugs and ice packs. Some bruising surfaced over my lower back the next day.In all fairness, Bhawa covered all my medical expenses and waived my spa costs (although not my mother's), and its owner could not have done more. Fortunately it was just a minor injury. But I have had spas and massages in Thailand many times before (at least over 20, I would say) and this was my first time ever to get injured during a massage. It was definitely a scary and terrible experience.Conclusion: Yes, the decor is great, the products that they use are good too, just like their sister brand Divana (even in the midst of the chaos, my mother fulfilled her duty and did some quick shopping for the friend who recommended us there), but it all depends on the masseuse that you get.The question is, are you willing to risk it here?I am writing this down because people should know about the risks of getting a spa massage - I didn't. Everything that is stated above is a true account of what happened to me."

Choosing a package:To be honest, I think my friend and I just dropped in one night and in our touristy MC Hammer pants, they let us in and treated us like prized customers from the get-go.You sit on a couch and look at their 'menu' of packages. I can't remember which one we picked but it was about 3500BHT and included: body scrub, oil massage, foot scrub, and ends with milky bath with rose petals(!). Whole thing was 3 glorious hours long. You are served tea as they ask for your preference on the oils to use (you sniff bottles) and on a body outline, where are places to concentrate on and 'no-touch' places lol. You also choose the level of 'force' as they massage you.The Room:So after walking up this grand marble staircase, you are led behind this big wooden door and there are two beds with ample distance between one another and a pillow for your face/head. You get changed as the masseuse's wait outside patiently for you and KNEELING the whole time (we noticed this when we went to fetch them after we changed back into our clothes). That's some crazy dedication if you ask me!They also have a cube-storage unit off to the side wall for your personal belongings. The Main Event: Then for three hours they massage you, oil you down, and exfoliate you. At one point you sit down and the masseuses get down on the their knees and scrub your feet as you enjoy a small snack and drink. I fell asleep like twice during the massages because they were SO good - my friend said I even snored a little. The grand finale is a milky bath with rose petals in a classy wooden polished barrel container. You get to shower off but I suggest you don't because your skin feels so moisturized that it's a waste to wash it all off. You are then led back downstairs and you get more tea, some fruit snacks, and then you fill in a comment card.(We pretty much were given so much food throughout this entire experience that we just ate a meat skewer afterwards for dinner!)Location:This is the only downside to this place. It's kinda hidden on the end of a small street and asking for directions from locals was difficult. We ended up using a taxi to the main street. You then walk down this slightly sketchy-looking street (it was dark and abandoned looking), then hang a right and you\"ll see it at the very back in all it's majestic glory. The building itself felt like a grand mansion!P.S. When we finished, a lady actually escorted us out and walked behind us (from afar) until we were at the end of their street! We'd turn back every while to actually see if she's still following us and she'd just smile and do a little head bow. It was cute :)So what are you waiting for? GO GO GO!"

One thing I think is not perfect was the treatment bed do not have a hole for put the face down. They use a towel and small pillow instead. My neck feeling not comfortable. Overall their treatment is good, my legs relaxed a lot. But I think still have room to improve their treatment bed and their towel had a very strange bad smell. After treatment, they served tea & fruits are tasty. I still recommend people to go coz of this spa is convenience."

Having read all the great reviews and recommendations on TripAdvsior, my husby and I decided to choose Bhawa Spa for spa treatment as part of our wedding anniversary programme.While my therapist was excellent, the one for my husby was, unfortunately, not good and definitely not up to our expectation for Bhawa Spa. My husby did not find his massage relaxing, and worst of all, he felt hard to breath after the massage because the massage was too strong and hard and lacked technique. He still feels hard to breath occasionally even it's now a few days after the massage... I'm really worried that he has been hurt by the therapist!We had our treatment at their new building and the music in the room stopped to play soon after the treatment started, and that had greatly affected the ambience. The beds were also too hard and not the type tailored made for massage, which also affected the quality of experience."

In Bhawa I don't know how they do it but the whole experience was amazing with only very minor tickling discomfort, which was absolutely bearable.This spa must be on the list of must go places besides all the temples. Definitely one of the best memories of Bangkok comes from Bhawa.The location is close to the monorail Nana station, in a clean, upscale area and fairly easy to find thanks to plenty of signs telling where to go. The spa itself have wonderful garden with a pool with stylish reception desk area.We took the four hours course and I truly wanted it to be even longer. The whole experience was so pleasant, we enjoyed every single minute of the massage, bath and just being there.Staff were incredibly polite, intelligent and welcoming, this spa is realy an oasis, worth the time and every single baht spent there.The welcome tea was awesome, the light meal after the procedures was delicious too. Definitely want to come again."

            "review": "Superb spa experience, highly recommended. We followed tripadvisor comments and we chose this spa and Boy was it good. As spa treatments are not cheap (cheaper than Canada but still not cheap), we decide to go with that month promotion which was the Emerald Gold Ayurveda and the tourmaline Supreme Detox at 4650 bahts for 240 minutes which includes a foot bath/exfoliation, a body scrub and wrap, a bath with rose petals, an oil massage, a facial and a lunch.Since we were not sure of which one would be the best, I indicated both in our reservation. The receptionist who's quite sharp understood that by herself and recommended the Tourmaline which was more age appropriate for us.The Bhawa spa is located in the embassies neighbourhood and easily accessible by BTS Ploen Chit, Exit 2, you then take Witthayu Road lumpini park direction. The street to the spa is past the Athenee Plaza Hotel but before the All Season Place. There's a cafe in a mall called the Verasu (you turn left right before you arrived at that cafe). if you're not sure turn backwards and you'll see the sign. You have to walk to the end of that street and then turn right, the spa is at the end of the Alley. The location is a big plus since you won't hear any traffic noise during your treatment,.A few words on the spa itself now, this is intended to be a high end experience and they really hit the curve. The spa is superbly decorated and has a wonderful garden/swimming pool next to it. No one seems to use it but it's just so pretty. When you arrive at the spa, they offer you a cold towel (artistically wrapped) and a refreshing beverage. You can visit the little boutique and enjoy the surroundings. They will ask you to fill out a questionnaire (see other reviewer picture) and smell the different scents to choose your oil massage (tray of little bottles). We chose the lime and lemon oil and it was divine, light, fruity and soothing. The personnel always seat down in the \"traditional way I believe\" when they talked to you (I think it's a form of thai politeness) and you feel extra special.We were then taken to our room (which is a new one), they seem to have rented/purchased some additional space. Personnel are all extra polite and they all say hello when they see you. We were introduced to our masseuses Nok and Poon who took care of us for the whole period of time. They both have super soft hands but you can feel that strength in they fingers and palms. even though we enjoyed the whole experience, the bath with the flower petals (the bathtub might be small for a man though) and the hot stone massage were the highlights of the whole experience. One word on the facial, I usually like my nose pores to be extracted which is not the way they do it here but I think that's the way they do it in Asia in general, you have to go to more a cosmetic treatment center to get those kind of facials.The whole thing took almost 4h30, I think they don't count the time you take your shower and dress up again. We were then walked back to the reception and served with a light lunch of spring roll, fried shrimp/surimi bites, ginger tea and fresh fruit. The masseuses tactfully stayed in the massage pavillon and we had to ask for them to show our gratitude and tip. The whole experience is 5******* and terrific value. Do try it, it will be great.PS. They don't have a locker, you just leave your items on a bench. I had jewelry on me and just left it in my handbag and I was not nervous at all about it but if you prefer, you might want to leave it in your hotel safe before you go to the spa."

It's an approx 20mins walk from Chitlom where I was staying and was easy to find. From stepping into the reception, the ambience was very relaxing, receptionists were welcoming and friendly, a refreshing fruity flavoured tea was served with a wet towel on a beautiful wooden plate. I booked Tourmaline Supreme Detox, which was a 4 hour treatment and on special. My room was in a separate annexe and high points for cleanliness, my masseuse was eager to please and what I especially liked, you complete a short form on your preferences and I ticked Medium - the strength throughout the treatment was maintained, which is not necessarily the case in other boutique spas. I was served drinks and fruit during the treatment and the light meal at the end was delicious - a refreshing soup with hints of lemongrass, juicy rice paper rolls, fried thin prawn (I think) sticks, fresh fruit. Although the pillows were uncomfortable no matter what height I placed my head, I opted for the rolled towels - the overall experience is on par with a spa in a five-star hotel and given the price, I highly recommend this hidden gem."

After a long flight back home, I was wishing Bhawa Spa had a location here in the States. Sigh...I just want to add that after a 4 hour spa treatment, they served us light lunch - Pad Thai. Can I tell you - it was the best Pad Thai I ever had!!I miss you Bhawa Spa..."

They could accommodate me relatively short noticed and responded to my email quite promptly. You can book the treatments online. When I arrived I was a bit afraid that they might have forgotten my reservation, but everything was well in place. It's a bit tough to find, but they send you a map. (also on website)The spa is very nicely decorated and looks very clean. You are offered drinks before during and after the massage/treatment, as well as fruits afterwards. They are very friendly and I will definitely go back and recommend my colleagues.My Relaxing Thai Touch for 100minutes was 1100 THB.They do offer crew discount for airliners (20%)."

A four hours spa package includes footwash, relaxing body scrub, a heated body mud/wrap, scented oil massage, and a jasmine floral milk bath. Total was under 4,000 baht. My spa therapist was Poon who was excellent. Albeit, the therapist here are much older than Banyan tree; the prices are much cheaper. Treatment room was very nice and large. The bath tub was too big (I had to sit up) otherwise I would of drowned. I did dislike the massage bed, it did not have a place to fit your face. So, my head was supported by pillows. Very uncomfortable facing down. Can't wait to go back in November to try the Royal Jelly special. They do have prepaid membership starting at 10,000 baht. Which gives you an additional 3,000 baht credit. So, it works out to be 23% discount) on regular priced treatments. Cannot double dip; using the membership credit on specials."

There is no sense of haste. Her voice is low and her smile on an infinite time line. I am then greeted by another team member of this welcome affair, my masseuse. She is there to please and help me journey to that peaceful world that she so rightfully understands. I am guided into a private change room that also holds a massive wooden tub. Adjacent to this room is the bathroom with a long wooden bench, topped with numerous scatter cushions. Once ready in my kimono like gown, her gentle guidance continues, as I am lead to my seat against a wall and asked to place my feet into a large brass urn.\" Would I go here again - ABSOLUTELY!

The place is quite small and cosy, and atmosphere is pleasant.I chose a scrub and oil massage for 2hours. Timing was fine. I was just a bit disappointed about the therapist. Although she was nice and kind, she was not listening to my requests to have a softer massage and she did it too strong for me. Usually, after one or two reminders to adapt the strength of the massage, it should be ok, but this time, I always need to tell her to be careful until the end. Thus it was difficult to be relax.Except that, I appreciated the efforts to manage lights, music, temperature of the shower, quality of the towels and overall cleanliness.The last body cleaning with warm wet towels to remove the extra of oil is a great pleasure.Although my complaints above, I recommend this SPA.

Firstly, it took me a while to choose a treatment from their fantastic selection and on the day I was not disappointed at all. The spa is beautful and will immediately have you relaxed from the moment you step inside. My therapist (Pun Pun) was great from beginning to end. Products used were of a high quality and Pun Pun was great throughout...her massages are awesome! Bhawa is easy to locate. A short walk from the BTS station tucked away in a quiet street. I highly recommend treating yourself to a 4 hour appointment. You will also be well fed afterwards - I finished off my treatment with a beautiful soup, Pad thai and fresh fruit salad. There was also a light snack and fruit during the course of the 4 hours. I have been to quite a few 4 hour treatments (it's a must at the end of any holiday! :)) and Bhawa is right up the top of my list of \"must do again's\" Cost is extremely reasonable in comparison to what I would get back home and I think not too expensive for BKK. I bought home some of their products (beautful range avaible) as gifts too. In the end I walked out of Bhawa feeling refreshed, relaxed, zen and full from the delcious food! One must treat themselves and what a great place to go. Will definately return."

I know Bangkok very, very well, and there always seems that there are two levels of spas: the really expensive ones and the really too-local ones. Bhawa is a new place that hits the sweet spot of luxury at an affordable price.The treatment specialists are highly trained and experienced (I recognized a few from one of the city's most expensive/overpriced spas!), they know their treatment techniques but also the many small things that separate a top shelf spa from one that is not. The managers have a keen eye to make sure your entire visit is a perfect balance of privacy and friendliness. The owners participate in the operation and, having visited Bhawa several months apart, are eager to constantly make improvements to what is already a wonderful experience.Bhawa is perfectly located on Wireless Road (Witthayu), near many western embassies (USA, Denmark, Vietnamese) and 5 star hotels (Conrad, etc). I can't wait to get back, and compress 6 months of weekly massages into one short holiday!"

Opting for a massage at a Korean spa in Bangkok may not be the most obvious choice ever made given that Thai massage is world-renowned, but do yourself a favour and give this place a try. It's friendly, family-run and has a setting full of character and charm, despite being slightly off the beaten Bangkok track on a little side road that twists and turns and had our cab driver doing his best to guess exactly where we were going. All that said, the journey was hardly harrowing and cost less than 150 baht from our central downtown hotel, so the place is more hidden gem than epic exploration find. Do make the effort. Su Esthetic had been recommended as a \"must do\" while on a brief break to Bangkok, not least because getting massaged in Thailand is one of my wife's favourite pastimes. Monique, the owner, had squeezed us both in at short notice for a basic hour-long massage. She had carefully explained to us how Korean massage differed from traditional Thai massage, seeking to manage potentially unmet expectations. There was no worry on that score as before we'd finished being kneaded and unknotted by tiny Thai women expertly trained in the Korean technique, my wife was already planning her next visit and treatments. Sadly Monique couldn't fit us in before we were due to leave town, so it'll just have to be something we do next time - it's a reason to go back to Bangkok all on its own."

Coming from Cambodia, I was looking for a professional facial treatment, and glad that I chose Su Spa. My skin glowed afterwards, and a week later it still shows! I was shown to a private, quiet room, and from that point, all I needed to do is relax, everything else was done by the therapist. I could not list how many different massages and facial techniques were used, all quickly and efficiently. One thing that is rare to find was done here: with a vacuum machine they quickly removed the blackheads, it only took like 1.5 minutes and was perfectly painless. The warm pillows that were put on my chest and belly immediately had me relax deeply. I booked an appointment a day before on the phone (recommended), and thanks to the map and directions on the site, I found the spa from the BTS station quite easily. The ambience is just amazing, everything is beautiful in the salon. I will definitely come back when in Bangkok next time!"

The lady boss was very friendly and personable and the environment is very calm and relaxing. We started with the aroma floral bath which was very soothing and calming.Then, we had the salt scrub which really smooths and nourishes the skin. I loved how soft and smooth my skin felt after the scrub! However, the scrub may not be suitable for people with very thin skin as the grains are really coarse. We then proceeded with our body and facial treatments. We didn't enjoy this experience though. My therapist was rushing to finish the entire treatment. There was no pressure from the massage at all (I'd specifically requested for a medium massage pressure knowing that my body's quite stressed) and everything applied on my face was just cold with no warning. My boyfriend's therapist was quite ok. She applied the right amount of pressure to soothe his tension. However, she may have focused a little too much on his armpits, he suffered from bruises for a couple of days. His face was really cleaned after the facial. I may visit Su Esthetics again as I liked the environment a lot. However, I will definitely not want the same therapists for the treatments."

The masseur exerts adequate strength and checks with you to ensure you're ok. The environment was quiet and peaceful, place was clean and cosy. Don't expect luxurious settings and fittings, just a pleasant home based spa. The room we had was good - not stuffy, spacious enough and temperature set was just nice. We have been to places where it was stuffy and with a faulty aircon that we were perspiring while having the massage.Service was great, making a reservation was a breeze. Monique was prompt in replying to emails and is able to recommend treatments based on one's needs. She explains and ensures that her masseurs are aware of any special request from the customers, making it a pleasant experience for us. She is able to converse in various languages so don't worry about any miscommunications. Just a minor setback is that the procedure seems to be inconsistent - e.g. some of us had certain parts massaged and some of us didn't. Also, on our second visit, one of us felt that the masseur was not as good as the previous and that she left my friend unattended for quite a long period of time during the treatment. Overall, one of the best massage we had, great service and well worth the money."

This, however was a minor minor issue compared to the treatment they provided. email responses were very prompt and easy to arrange an appointment with them. The place was quite some distance from the nearest bts station, but quite easy to find according to the map/instruction provided and its very cosy. I was very sweaty upon arrival and the waiting time allowed me to cool down. And needless to say, the staff was very professional. She tried to make sure I was comfortable as I then requested for a stronger massage. I felt sorry as I could hear her hands/fingers cracking and she said she was okay.

I've had Thai (never sure of the training the masseuse has though), Moroccan and Japanese massage. After checking their web site and calling the owner, I decided to go for it. The special price for the Signaturewas right too. I called the spa and spoke with the owner, a lady from Hong Kong. Her husband is from Canada. She assured me her staff were professional and trained. The experience was relaxing, professional and done in a clean environment. I suppose one could bring their own sheets and towels if they wished. The spa is a bit out of the way, but the directions are easy to follow. The massage is a top to bottom, front and back affair. A caution, if you're a female, you might want to be cautious as to the pressure they apply to your breasts. If one is shy about having the hips and thighs massaged, one might want to mention this to the staff in advance. This isn't a happy endings affair though! As a guy, I was comfortable with the medium pressure massage. The facial was great. I lift weights thus I enjoyed the relaxing feeling the back massage gave me. Based on my experience, I'd recommend if you're serious about a good massage, this is a place to go. See their web site for more info regarding services, prices and location.

I was recommended SuEsthetic by friends, which me and my other half decided to check out in April 2015 (did not leave a TripAdvisor comment last time as I did not have an account yet). My account all setup now so by a stroke of luck I had another trip to Bangkok in June 2015 so I called them up to see if there were any availability slots. It was a fluke there were one or two no shows so they were able to accommodate me and my friends.The experience is a must try from the second you walk into the spa, you are greeted with warm smiles. Then they sit you down with a glass of water to cool you down after getting to the spa (it\u2019s a short walk but with the Bangkok weather, it\u2019s hot) She (Monique) will then share with you the types of treatments they have available. I took the 1.5 hours signature face and body, it was very relaxing and the masseuse checks on you to make sure the strength being used isn\u2019t too strong, as not everyone can\u2019t take it. I requested for the medium strength to play safe.After you are done, you will head back to ground floor with a nice tea (think it was Chinese tea) served to you and then just rest a while before you make your move.So when I am next in Bangkok it\u2019s near enough confirmed I will defiantly pop over again."

I booked for the SIGNATURE FACE & BODY MASSAGE + RF FACE FIRMING which cost 1300baht which isn't too bad considering their service.The owner and the therapists were very nice and friendly to us. We were greeted with a cup of hot tea and then briefed through shortly by the owner. She even asked us the preference that we want. (strong/medium/soft) I chose medium and it was a bit too strong for me. The awkward part was when she pulled down your towel and massaged your breast. I didn't like that part. (and yea, it's included in the package) The leg massage was so comfortable that I think I've went into dreamland. I was awaken by the cold mask which was applied on my face. The facial treatment was pretty good too. The therapist applied many layers of liquid/ mask on my face which smells and feel good. I fell asleep once again as it was really comfortable. I bought a bottle of hair shampoo which costs around 250baht if i remember correctly. They also sell other spa products such as lotion, soaps, massage oil. For couples, You can request for 'Room 6'. It is a room with 2 bed, quite spacious. We couldn't get a taxi at that area so we used uber."

To start, the service was great from the quick reply to our online booking, to the friendly greeting (the manager seems to speak about 10 languages) and we really like the massage and facial. Very relaxing. After, they gave us tea and we sat around in the nice room and did our emails.It's difficult to remember all the massages I've had in Bangkok, but this place ranks right up there with the best of the best, even including the places charging five times more.

I chose the 90-minute \"Signature\" face and body massage -- which was incredible. The masseuse got deep into the muscles (which proved very therapeutic after my squash game that morning), but she was never painful. Her technique, which apparently incorporates Korean massage principles, translated into pure bliss on my legs, arms and hands. Overall, this spa seems very well managed, the experience is incredibly soothing and relaxing and for what they charge, very good value indeed. An hour and half will zip by, and then you will gently return to earth."

I did a one and half hour face & body treatment with intensive eye treatment. Everything was fine. My only complaint is that the massage felt a bit short. Though the treatment lasted full one and half hours, the actual massage part was much less than what I had in other places. There were times when the masks were drying, which could have been used for massage. Having said that, it was a minor quibble & the entire experience was quite enjoyable for us."

Su Esthetic was away from the busy streets (while slightly off the beaten path- they are happy to speak with your cab driver and explain where they are located- or there are good walking instructions on their website)- It was clean- quiet, and adorable. I had a facial and massage, and my friend had a body scrub and facial... They were WONDERFUL, quiet, perfectly gentle and so so relaxing. She asked before beginning how strong I wanted my massage- I also expressed some concern about skin sensitivities- She really listened and both were perfect. The staff were very professional- courteous and quiet- And as it started raining, they scrambled around to try and get us a taxi- even going as far as rushing out to the main street to flag one down... (Although it didn't work out, we TRULY appreciated the effort... ) The place is already affordable, but the promo prices are an extra sweet deal. I will absolutely be back-"

I have had massages before, but this one was my favorite by far and my husband's first full body massage. Upon arrival we were greeted by a front staff member who invited us to remove our shoes (to keep the interior clean), enjoy a cup of tea, and wait on the couches in the lobby area. The establishment itself is very quiet and peaceful. It was not hard to find but we had our phones with a map application. It was approximately a 15 minute walk from the closest MTR, but the walk was through a quiet neighborhood. Regardless of the method of arrival, THIS PLACE IS WORTH THE TREK! The interior of the spa is clean--from the waiting area, to the bathroom, and the massage rooms. Everything is immaculate and quiet, thus creating a calming environment perfect for relaxation.We booked a 1 hour couple's massage. Our masseuses were punctual, professional, and very polite. They routinely asked if the pressure level was acceptable and adjusted their firmness as was appropriate. We both enjoyed how balanced and detailed the massage was in that they paid proper attention to individual parts of our bodies, working their way from head to toe methodically and evenly. This massage was a blend of Thai and Korean influences, as they advertise on their website. Be prepared to be bent in (comfortable) ways you have not thought of, but the end result is worth it! At the end of the massage we both felt mellow, relaxed, and I personally wished we booked more time simply because it FELT. SO. GOOD. We paid 1500 baht total with tip included (those ladies were great and earned it!) for both of us for a full hour, which was approximately $46 USD. It was such a good deal, especially when some of the other places we considered were over 2000 baht per person. We highly recommend Su Esthetic and would return here if we ever visit Bangkok again!"

Treatment was carried out as advertised. Even provide free samples for take away. The only problem was the not so easy to find location. Need to take a taxi there. Not close to any BTS. So if you visit too late, might run into the problem of finding transport back. Overall still highly recommended to visit for a relaxing time"

We went to the spa on a Sunday evening and it was the best 90 minutes and 900 Baht I've spent so far in BKK.I went with my husband and took the signature body & facial massage and it was really professionally done - right from the fact that they were punctual to how good they were at their job.They say so on their website and it is in fact a little tricky to find them. We walked it from Phrong Phong and I would suggest that to everyone else to. One finds any massage parlors on the way but the 15 minute walk is worth it. I would suggest booking an appointment on their website prior to the visit. Must visit people. I had an excellent time!"

The therapist, though without much English, was very professional and pleasant. In fact I found the lack of fluent English much better than having someone trying to chat or wanting to sell me something during the massage!The owner is extremely friendly and helpful, just like when I met her years ago at the spa, and I admire her for her patience and the way she handles customers from different countries.I will recommend this spa to anyone who wants good services and a relaxing time in busy Bangkok."

From BTS Phrom Phong station, the walking distance is around 10 minutes. It is a two-storey house with treatment rooms upstairs. Their staff and therapists are warm and friendly. When making our appointment, we were happy to know that their signature treatments are now on promotion. We booked a session of face and body massage (90 minutes) under the special promotion price of 900 baht (regular price is 1800 baht). The face and body massage is really a complete top-to-toe pampering including a korean aroma oil massage, facial massage, bust lifting, special tummy massage with herbal hot pack to soothe the tummy and improve blood circulation. I must say that the therapist is very skillful and well-experienced. I enjoy korean massage with relatively strong and fast massage techniques to ease the tension of my tired muscles. It is the first time I tried bust and tummy massage and they are wonderful ! I will surely return next time."

Today I tried their aroma body massage (with their lovely & very light scented lavender massage oil) which lasted for 90 minutes (900 baht). My therapist (khun Pa) is super strong and has such confidence (now I know the meaning of \"a Korean Touch\"!!!). If you're looking for a watered down & pampering kind of treatments, this spa may not suit you. However, if you enjoy a stronger & faster massage with Korean, Thai and Chinese techniques combined together, then you'd REALLY love the massage here. The staff here are polite, lovely and sweet too!!!"

I visited Su Esthetic Home Spa with my parents for a 1 &1/2 hour massage & facial. Upon entering the spa, we were greeted by the ever so sweet spa owner, Monique, and were asked to remove our shoes (slippers & hot tea were provided). We were then escorted upstairs into a beautifully decorated and clean room separated by curtains for a little more privacy. We slipped into a wrap towel and laid face up on the massage table. We are massage enthusiasts and never have we experienced a massage & facial simultaneously. The massage was deep, relaxing, and at times awkward (bust lifting & firming). My built up tension (knots) melted away with the rather interesting yet effective Korean techniques. The facial was equally fabulous as they applied a series of soothing masks & even an ultrasonic cleansing machine that sucked all the impurities & blackheads out of my clogged up skin. Once our services were complete, I went into a room downstairs to apply my makeup and fix my hair. The room was set up with a large mirror, table, bed (if one would like to take a nap) and supplies (cotton balls, qtips, hairspray, etc). Overall, the most wonderful experience one could have at a spa at very affordable prices. Highly recommended!Note: It was a bit tricky finding the location. We took the BTS train to the Phrom Phong station. We wasted 15 minutes trying to find a cab driver that understood english or was able to read our printed map of the location. We ended up walking into a bank to exchange money (the spa only accepts cash) and we asked one of the bank tellers to write in Thai the address of the spa. It was then that we were able to find a cab driver to take us to the spa. I recommend doing the same as well as including the phone number of the spa so the driver can call and ask for directions."

The staff were well trained and throughout the massage they barely stopped for breaks unlike other places where the masseuse sort of leave you waiting in between different treatments which in turn shortened the treatment time.Definitely will be back for more the next time I'm in Bangkok!Note: If you're considering this spa, remember to print the map on their website or save their phone number as the place is a little tricky to get to.

I made an online booking to obtain a promotional rate.I corresponded with Monique via email who help me select the appropriate treatment. Her responses were prompt and addressed my questions. I selected the Traditional Korean Spa which includes aroma spa bath, full body scrub, and their face and body massage. Upon arriving at the Spa sweaty, I was offered a chilled drink and Monique explained the different type of oil. I was led to a pleasant, clean private room which has the spa tub and two massage beds. The aroma spa was pleasant, refreshing, and relaxing. After the spa, my masseur explained the various procedures that she is going to performed. My masseur started with my face cleaning before doing the massages. Her massages were firm and strong which helps me to loosen up the tight muscles around my shoulders and lower back. The whole process was not rushed, even though I had a plane to catch, and made me feeling very comfortable and relax on my next long-haul flight. When I arrived at my final destination after travelling about ~ 30 hours flight time due to a strike at Frankfurt airport, the body still feels fine!!!Thank you for your treatments, prompt responses and suggestions, and running a professional place which I truly appreciate."

Ours just called and got directions from the spa, and drove there directly with no problems.About the experience: just wonderful. Me and my boyfriend had the 1,5 hour signature face and body massage, and it was amazing. Value for money too, the price was just 900 baht. They were very professional, and definitely knew what they were doing. The cups of tea before and after the treatment were also a nice gesture, and they helped us get a taxi afterwards. High recommended."

Our masseuses spoke a wee bit of english, thus I did not face any difficulties understanding her instructions. The receptionist is fluent in english and was kind enough to call us a taxi after our massage, and relay to the drivers our destination, despite it was nearing their closing time and most of the cabs were uninterested in picking us, so it did took quite a bit of effort from them to get us a cab. I do agree that the location is hard to get to. While there was a map provided, the map is not drawn to scale and we underestimated the distance of the spa from phrom phong station. Thus, we did face a little difficulty going there. Do note that the walk from Sukhumvit Road to Soprano House (along Soi 26) is about 10-15 minutes walk. Thereafter, there are clear signage directing to the spa. The whole atmosphere at the spa is truly tranquil and comforting. As mentioned above, the massage provided left my partner and myself very satisfied. All in all, I do recommend everyone to try Su esthetics."

The spa itself is spotlessly clean, well maintained and has a relaxing atmosphere. I have had their Signature Massage & Facial every time and would recommend this if your are only having one treatment. One hint for readers is that if you should book on a weekday afternoon - mornings are much busier. We went on a Wednesday after lunch and at times it felt empty! Lovely.

When we arrived we decided to ask the Taxi to wait for us as it looked like it may be difficult to get another in the area. The centre is in a gated commercial area with security. You take the first right after security and it's about half way down. Donovan welcomed us and took us upstairs to one of the float rooms to explain the concept and the workings of the pods. We had a one hour float. It is definitely something I would recommend everyone try, but it is a personal thing as to whether you would enjoy it. I am still undecided however my husband enjoyed it and is going back for a second float. The centre is extremely clean, staff friendly and overall it was a nice experience. Hint- you float naked so no need for swimmers. The centre has shampoo, conditioner and body wash as you will need a shower before and after the float. They also have hairbrushes, hairdryer, deodorants etc for afterwards."

Upon arrival, Donovan greeted us and was very informative about what we were doing. It seems a bit intimidating at first, but after our conversation, I was ready to give it a shot. Before floating in the pod, you are required to take a shower to remove any fragrances, lotions, and deodorants that are on the body. Make sure you ease your way into the water as there is a lot of Epsom salt and if it gets into your eyes it may burn a bit. They do provide a spray bottle and towel in case that may happen. All I can say is that the float was awesome. You have a choice to float with or without relaxation music. You can also have a choice of keeping the lights on or off. I kept my lights on for at least half the session. After the float, I felt totally relaxed and my body and mind felt stress free. I highly recommend this place!"

This was my first time floating (Literally because I am that rubbish at swimming).I went with my girlfriend, we took the MRT to Udom Suk and then a quick taxi ride to the place. Its should be quite easy for the driver to find, I'd say try keeping a screenshot of the address/map on your phone if you dont have 4g. The information is all on their website/app.You get to the place and you're greeted by the staff who are very cool and chilled guys. Then you have to sign a waiver, just incase you somehow fall asleep and end up floating on your front. No but really theres a waiver form you have to fill out with the usual; name/d.o.b/health. Theres also a 35000B fine for contaminating the water with \"bodily fluids\" so no funny business, this isnt phuket.We then proceeded upstairs where one of the pods are (1 pod first floor/2nd pod second floor. No room and like 20 giant bags of salt on the side. The staff member then gives us a quick very informative talk about the pods, some tips and benefits on our first float. You go into the pods naked (who doesn't wanna be naked floating around in a strange pod), so need for any swim wear, you're provided with towels for the shower you need to take before and after the float, ear plugs to block the salt out and a face towel accompanied with a small spray bottle with water incase you get salt in your eyes.Once you're in the tub you can turn off the colour changing lights on the sides to turn the pod pitch black (which I stupidly forgot to do) then just float and relax. Everyones experience is different.In the beginning I was just relaxed and just starting thinking about super random things. Then moments of stillness, (had an itch on my nose. Scratched it and got one singular water drop in my eye. It burns. Alot. Just saying) then followed by thinking I was on the ceiling looking down and many more other experiences/feelings (hard to explain what I felt. Just go already). At the end of it I'd like to say I think I have reached a good level of Zen. Might try and go again this week if i have the chance.Tips:- First time floaters pay 1600B instead of the usual 1950B.- Dont need to bring swim wear/towel as you float butt naked and are provided with a towel.- Use spray when water gets into eyes.- Put earbuds in properly (which I didnt do. Got dried up salt in my ear as I type this).- Fully just relax your neck and let it just sit back into the water or you'll get a sore neck.- Dont forget to turn off the light like i did.- Finally just go in and don't think too hard. Just try to relax and let it happen.Happy floating. Peace"

The place was easy to find. Once there we signed in and had a brief orientation on how to use the pods and what to expect. We floated for one hour but the time passed by so quickly. After floating we both felt very light like we had the best massage. We booked again for another round as we were told that the second float is even better. Looking forward to the next time!!"

I purchased a package after my first float because I knew immediately that this is something that I want to do on a regular basis. I'm so happy I found Bangkok Float Center because i felt so safe and welcome there. Sean is a great guide and very helpful in answering any questions before the float. Even afterwards we chatted for a bit about my first experience in the tank. It's been a couple days since my last float but I still can feel the benefits from just 1 hour in the float pod, both physically and mentally."

The whole experience was great. The equipment is modern and clean. And I came out of the pod feeling very refreshed and clear minded. I wish I would have tried this years ago."

Even after getting my hotel to ensure the cab driver knew this location and I handed to the driver the directions given by the Center (in Thai), I could see the cab driver having difficulty trying to locate it. His cab shot past the place but luckily I spotted the Enterprize Park signage and got down and walked back to the location."

I heard about this place through a friend, and was intrigued because I had always wondered what sensory deprivation would be like. Being a SCUBA diver, I thought it would be similar in terms of weightlessness and relaxation. And after just finishing a round of chemotherapy, I thought it would be a great way to heal my body and mind. I meditate regularly, but after the chemotherapy I was having a lot of trouble concentrating. So I had a lot of expectations and preconcieved notions as to what the experience would be like, and what I would get out of it. But still I was amazed. The first ten minutes or so was a bit strange, bumping into the sides of the tank and remembering to relax my neck. Then after about about 25 minutes I felt completely at ease, and a weightlessness that is different even from diving. I quickly lost track of time, drifting through various stages of relaxation, and from moments of intense thinking to complete silence of the mind. Getting out I felt very relaxed, although a bit spacey for about 45 minutes. That night I slept straight through, which hadn't happened since I started cancer treatment 6 weeks ago. I was impressed with the float experience, impressed with the facilities, and very impressed with the staff. I am going to be going in for floats as often as I can, and recommending this to all of my friends."

As an international DJ sometimes I don't see my home and my own bed for weeks, across cities and continents I am constantly on the move. I love what I do, however the lifestyle can really take its toll on the mind and the body. Recently I was in Bangkok for a big show and a good friend arranged a float for my belated birthday gift. As I had just come off a very intense two week tour of India - my first time there - I was eager for anything therapeutic. I have to admit I had no idea what to expect, so read up on TripAdvisor, as well as their very helpful website as to what to expect being a 'first timer'. Upon arrival I was very impressed with the clean, modern facilities \u2026 and the manager put me at ease and explained everything in a way that made me feel very comfortable., and even excited about what was to come. The experience itself was super relaxing and somehow cleansing to my mind as well, helping to wipe away many nagging stresses I had collected recently from the trip. At the end of the session, I emerged from the pod totally refreshed and invigorated. I'd recommend this to anyone, and especially for people who's lifestyle requires a proper balancing act. In fact, I will be sure to revisit the Center the next time I come through BKK.."

These resources are not only a luxury, they are a necessity. Massage and yoga are wonderful tools, as well as occasional meditation, but thus far the very best resource I have found is floating. It is also the most effortless thing possible to achieve peace, as one need only to lie down in the tank and relax. Regardless of what mood I come in with, whatever problems or issues I may be facing, floating is my refuge and clears away all the clutter of my mind, and eases all my body's aches and pains. As well, I have chronic pain issues in my neck and lower back, and floating in an anti-gravity environment has proven extremely effective in relieving the pain. Floating has become such an integral part of my life, I simply can't imagine living without it ... and recommend it to everyone I know.

Suda gives you a long talk before the float, then you go into your own private room, shower and undress, enter the tank (you can choose if you want the lid open or closed, the lights on or off) and float for one hour. Then you shower again to remove the salt.The experience inside the tank is incredibly beautiful, very peaceful and almost magical. The water temperature is pleasant, neither too hot nor too cold, the place itself is clean and welcoming and the general feeling is one of relaxed professionalism.

There was music in the beginning and end of the session to get relaxed. After about 15 minutes i lost track of time and was like in a lucid dream. After getting out my muscles and body felt so relaxed. I want one of these pods for my home! Five star experience!! Highly recommended"

            "review": "Highway to Meditation. We are in Bangkok and we seen some reviews of this place online.We decided to give it a go because we've never seen it before, at least reviewed online...From the first moment you can expect a super fast response on emails and calls. Besides that it was a real relief to finally talk to somebody who has perfect English and you don't have to decipher what kind of words are going out of his mixed Thai and American mouth.Donovan gives you a great insight on what you'll experience and he makes you feel comfortable and at ease while he explains all the procedures that you're going to have before you enter your floating Capsule!I would define this experience as a highway to meditation. If you ever tried to meditate you know how hard it can be. In the floating capsule it's like you're paying the toll to an easier way to the meditation road!It is definitely an experience that I would recommend after some days in the most crazy city in the world.At some point you lose the track of your body, then time, and then space... And you silly float in the emptiness of your mind .The results? Well those ones are different from person-to-person, but mine were as if I was in some kind of massage for five days!Thanks Donovan for all the professionalism and sympathy "

This time I felt like i got really deep into the float and some interesting thing came to me in the dream pod. Eed was very good at helping me with questions i had after the session was over. thanks again"

            "review": "Body High. I wanted to try the sensory deprivation tank as it's not available in Manila. So when we were in Bangkok, we made it a point to give it a shot and were not disappointed! The float center itself is quite far from where we stayed in Asoke. We booked an Uber to take us there and back, but the only problem was that by the time our session finished, we were stuck in the middle of rush hour in the city! Make sure you can schedule your float when you don't have to endure the rush hour so that your experience keeps you relaxed.Eed, the float center's lovely receptionist, walked us through the process before we signed waivers. I personally did not know what to expect from floating for the first time, so I was a bit anxious to find out if it would work on me or not. But Eed had a really positive vibe that helped me relax upon waiting for my first float. An hour is enough for first timers, as you will definitely feel the effects for that duration. It really takes the floater the surrender of the senses by relaxing to maximize the whole experience. It's hard to tune out the different sensations of the physical body, but it's definitely worth a try! Mentally prepare yourself for some stinging for the first few minutes if you have skin allergies or even just mild rashes --- the saline solution will kind of give you a burning sensation (it goes away after you tune out). After the first hour, I got out with my body feeling really really light and relaxed --- I'd say the results done to my sore muscles was better than coming out from a massage! It actually stayed that way for the rest of the night! It takes a lot more practice to get better at meditating or tuning out while you're in the float, and as a first timer, I say that I'm definitely interested in trying it out once I'm back in Bangkok. Whether or not you get to have those psychedelic experiences you read about on the internet, you're assured that you will leave the float center with at least the benefit of floating in epsom salt (which is really good for the skin) and getting to get your mind silent from the noise for at least an hour."

            "review": "Very interesting experience. Friendly staff and it was fun to try. Recently visited Bangkok and stopped into the Float Center. I wasn't really sure what to expect from the experience. I had had many massages in town already and thought it would be fun to try something different. I am not the lay quietly, let your mind relax kind of guy, so it took some getting used to. The concept is pretty simple, you lay in salt water that has something like 600 kg of salt inside an egg-looking shell. The salt in the water will suspend you and once the lights are out and you've taken a good 10 minutes or so to get over the fact that yes, you are just going to lay there quietly for the next hour, your mind will go blank and you will feel very relaxed. The salt and zinc are good for your skin we were told and being a major skeptic before going in, it was better than I had expected and I was surprised that I didn't dislike it. I would try it again but would do a 1hr session. This time I did 1.5 hours and it was too much for me. The staff at the centre were excellent. I think her name was Suda and she was very friendly, educated us and really wanted our feedback. The fun thing was that because the water is heated to body temperature, you forget that you are floating in water and occasionally feel like you are floating in air. It is ideal for people that meditate, people that like to have quiet time, mothers with screaming children, athletes and older people I would say. I will go again when I am in Bangkok next."

            "review": "It was life changing! . Last night I tried out what we called a \"Sensory Deprivation Tank\" or a \"Floating Tank\". It's a place where you go and lie down in water that is full of Epsom salt allowing you to float freely without having to worry about anything. The lights are off, you are in there with nothing but yourself and your mind. The tank is mainly used for the soul purpose of relaxing your mind and eventually accessing different parts of your mind that is easier to reach since you don't have the distraction from anything around you. I experienced something whilst I was floating that I would have to describe as life changing and intense. I am so happy to have had the opportunity to experience what I have experienced and it has definitely opened my eyes to so many new aspects of life in general. I got to \"reprogram\" myself and think of my current state of being. Basically I was able to do a full self reflection for about 1h30. Anyone who has the opportunity to go and try to float, please do go. Everyone experiences it differently as we all think and feel differently. This will most definitely not be the last time that I'll be floating. Thank @bangkokfloatcenter for giving me this experience !"

I read a lot of reviews on bangkok float centre & wanted to try it for myself. I was not the least disappointed. I have experienced many different massages but a session of floating definitely does something much deeper to relax , rejuvinate the mind & body. The place is kept clean, Cozy. I had booked for our session few hours in advance & was responded immediately with a confirmation. Was expecting to meet Donovan who could brief us before the session but his assistant did a great job. she explained every aspect in detail & was very welcoming & professional. Will definitely go for another session when Im in bangkok next."

The float tank itself was fantastic and the facilities were great with a nice little chill out room for immediately after where you can sit and have a cup of herbal tea as you want some brief time to reflect on the experience. One thing I would recommend is going for the 90 minute session,as the first 10 minutes felt like I was just getting used to the environment which feels quote bizarre at first, but once you left go and relax time will fly by!

In the past I've floated on the standard Samadhi tank back home in Chicago. The Dream Pods are much bigger which has a few benefits\u2026 First - your hands and feet don\u2019t touch the walls as much, which aids in the experience. Second - the roof is much taller which allows more air to come into the tank. In the Samadhi, it\u2019s more cramped, and could feel like there\u2019s not enough air inside. Third - the thing looks like a spaceship you'd see out of a sci-fi movie. Donavan the owner is really nice guy - if it\u2019s your first float, he takes the time to prep you and make sure you\u2019re comfortable going in.Definitely recommend it to anyone in Bangkok."

Have a Great journey at Bangkok Float Center!\u30a2\u30a4\u30bd\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u30af\u3092\u3054\u5b58\u3058\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u306a\u3089\u4e00\u5ea6\u306f\u8a2a\u308c\u305f\u3044\u305f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5834\u6240\u306f\u30e1\u30ac\u30d0\u30f3\u30ca\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u8eca\u30675\u5206\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002Enteprize Park\u3068\u3044\u3046\u5927\u304d\u306a\u770b\u677f\u306e\u5728\u308b\u6577\u5730\u5185\u306b\u3001\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5b88\u885b\u3055\u3093\u306b\u306f\u300c\u30d0\u30f3\u30b3\u30af\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30c8\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3048\u3070\u30aa\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u30c9\u30f3\u3055\u3093\u306f\u30bf\u30a4\u3068\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30d5\u3001\u53d7\u4ed8\u306e\u5973\u6027\u30a4\u30fc\u30c9\u3055\u3093\u306f\u30bf\u30a4\u4eba\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u82f1\u8a9e\u3082\u582a\u80fd\uff08\u30a4\u30fc\u30c9\u3055\u3093\u306f\u5c11\u3057\u306a\u3089\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3082\u308f\u304b\u308b\u304b\u3082\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\uff09\u3002\u30c9\u30f3\u3055\u3093\u306f\u8349\u6d25\u306e\u65b9\u306b\u65c5\u884c\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3068\u304b\u3002\u30ea\u30e9\u30af\u30bc\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u52b9\u679c\u3084\u8eab\u4f53\u306e\u75db\u307f\u3092\u548c\u3089\u3052\u308b\u52b9\u679c\u306f\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\u3001\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u906e\u65ad\u3057\u3066\u8133\u3092\u4f11\u307e\u305b\u3001\u611f\u899a\u3092\u92ed\u304f\u3059\u308b\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30a2\u30a4\u30bd\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u30af\u3002\u30b3\u30b3\u306e\u30bf\u30f3\u30af\u306fDream pod\u3067\u3001\u30de\u30e6\u578b\u306e\u8fd1\u672a\u6765\u7684\u306a\u30d5\u30a9\u30eb\u30e0\u304c\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002LED\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u304c\u30ad\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u3064\u3051\u3066\u307f\u305f\u304f\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u306b\u306f\u771f\u3063\u6697\u3067\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u65c5\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u3053\u3068\u3092\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u4e07\u304c\u4e00\u304c\u3042\u3063\u3066\u3082\u3001\u30bf\u30f3\u30af\u5185\u306b\u7dca\u6025\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u5b89\u5fc3\u3067\u3059\u3088\u30022\u968e\u30683\u968e\u306b1\u53f0\u305a\u3064\u30bf\u30f3\u30af\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u8907\u6570\u3067\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3082\u540c\u6642\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3081\u307e\u3059\u30023\u540d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3067\u3082\u30b5\u30ed\u30f3\u98a8\u306e\u30a6\u30c3\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u306a\u30ea\u30d3\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u305d\u3053\u3067\u306f\u30de\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c1\u30a7\u30a2\u3084\u98f2\u307f\u7269\u3001\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u3084\u98f4\u304c\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3081\u3001\u306e\u3093\u3073\u308a\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u53d7\u4ed8\u306e\u6c34\u69fd\u4ed8\u304d\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u3069\u3001\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u3082\u306a\u304b\u306a\u304b\u79c0\u9038\u3002\u305c\u3072\u4e00\u5ea6\u8a2a\u308c\u3066\u307f\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002"

The chill-out zone where one can stay for some time after the float is a unique feature that clearly shows that the owner does not intend to \"just provide a float tank\" like most facilites around the world do."

When I had a free day in Bangkok I was happy to unintentionally come across Bangkok Float Center online. It felt like it was meant to be and that now was the time. I struggle to maintain a daily meditation ritual, but have tried to keep some kind of practice throughout the last few years. Floating was a new level of meditation. It was serene. Donovan, the owner, is a very friendly guy who immediately makes you feel at home. It did not seem like a business. There was no rush about anything. He seemed willing to talk with me about my experience both before and after the float. The facilities are new and clean. It was a very positive experience and I hope to have an opportunity to do it again. 5 out of 5."

Maybe I hadn't quite eaten enough, maybe the room temperature was a little too warm for me, maybe my low blood pressure was causing it, I don't know. However, it was quite interesting for the 25 minutes I was in there and I would've liked to stay in there for at least an hour or so.The float center itself is GREAT! It's REALLY clean and very nicely decorated. I talked quite a lot with Donovan who created this place and told me his story and explained the entire floating process to me as well. Even though my floating experience wasn't that awesome, I did have a great time talking to him and think I learned a few things from him as well.All in all, I definitely recommend anyone who thinks the concept of floating sounds interesting to check out this Bangkok Float Center. I think my so-so experience was due to myself and judging from the other reviews it's an outlier."

I had never heard of floating before, so it was completely new to me. It is amazing!!! If you have never done it, you should definitely try it! I believe, it is different for everyone, but for me it was very much needed. In the stressful lives that we live, it is very important to find time for yourself and it is often so difficult to relax. This floating experience gave me such a great feeling both physically and emotionally, that I would like to do it again and again. The Floating centre is great. Very beautifully furnished, very clean, and the moment you walk in, you feel the calmness and the nice atmosphere. At first, you get an introduction about the process, what to do, what not to do. Everything is being very well explained, it is impossible to misunderstand something. The floating itself is just great. If you let it go and just relax, it is amazing. It feels so natural and easy. Afterwards, I was drinking a very delicious ginger tea, feeling very relaxed and great. We were talking some more about my experience and how important it is to relax in this stressful life that we live in. Thank you so much, it was so great!!! I will definitely go there again next time I possibly can!A small TIP to others regarding the location of the place. If you go there by a taxi from the metro station and even if you have the instructions in Thai on how to get there, it might be that the taxi driver doesn't know the place and somehow can't even understand the directions (in Thai). It happened to me, and it took me 40 minutes to get there instead of around 10, because the taxi driver just couldn't find it. As they mostly don't speak any English at all, it is impossible to talk to them. When at first I asked him if he knew where it is, he was nodding his head, so I thought he knows it, but apparently we misunderstood each other. Just be careful with that. Maybe it is better to print the google maps location and way how to get there."

After having floated 3 times before, I was really curious to try this float spa I've heard so much about in Bangkok. Once I entered I could already see how professional it is set up and after speaking to the staff and owner, how dedicated they are towards floating. Once in the tank I probably had the best float session ever. I was suffering from light insomnia for the previous weeks and it had really bugged me. After the float I felt so relaxed, calm, focused and chilled out. I felt like I was finally able to let go and to be able to control my thoughts again. Once back home I had the best night sleep in weeks. This is something really amazing that in my opinion everyone should try. Most people don't even know about floating, or very little, although it can be such a powerful tool which can solve so many problems in life, For me, I can really recommend this to anyone!"

However after floating for 60 minutes in the float tank i am a true believer in what floating can do. I came in with back and should pains that i have had for years. Im constantly taking pain pills and have lived with these pains for years. I came out of the tank with no pain at all!! It was gone and has not came back since i floated 3 days ago. The lady at the float center was great in preparing me for the float session and the place was easy to find and very zen like. I purchased a 3 pack and will be returning very soon. Highly recommend floatation to all that are on the fence about it! See you next time!!"

            "review": "How to Be a Better Person, start floating.. Life is a constant exercise in self-improvement. And while some of that focus lands squarely on becoming more educated or rising in the ranks of the workplace, sometimes we forget to improve how we treat ourselves and those around us. In the rush to achieve, the idea of being \"better\" can become lost to ambition and selfishness. The journey to improving your soul and your compassion toward yourself and others begins here. There is no environment on earth that allows the human body to hyper relax and be alleviated from gravity, while at the same time plugging the mind, the real you right into your mainframe. The power of nothing is really the most powerful something.Once you make floating a part of your monthly routine you will only become a better person holistically. You will find yourself looking for the positives in all things, looking for smiles from all faces. You'll be humble and true to yourself in a way you never knew was possible. As Terrace Mckenna famously said: \u201cYou are a divine being. You matter, you count. You come from realms of unimaginable power and light, and you will return to those realms.\u201d\u2013 Terence McKennaFloating will be your vessel to such realms. Bangkok Float Centre can provide you the keys :)"

Wanted to update my earlier review in the hopes of turning more people on to this amazing self-help tool \u2026 as well as possibly sway anyone who is on the fence about trying it out for the first time. I had my first float a little over three months back, and since then have been back a dozen or so times, roughly once per week. At approximately the same cost as a decent massage in a high-end spa, I've found that the floatation experience goes wayyyy beyond the physical relaxation one enjoys from a massage - and for the money, an unbelievable self-therapy bargain. I think the main point I felt compelled to convey to your readers is whatever amazement, joy, and relaxation I experienced with the first float \u2026 it was quickly surpassed with each subsequent float \u2026 a higher and higher vibration with each one \u2026 a deeper and deeper exploration. An amazing phenomenon began to take form as routine \u2026 whereby I would emerge from the tank simultaneously relaxed utterly, yet at the same time deeply energised and revved up. Try as I might, I can't recall any activity that ever brought me such a polarity of energy, such a contrasting state of mind and body \u2026 yet with a delightful synergy. In short, I'm hooked. If a week goes by now without slipping into the tank I notice I'm not feeling at full power. I can't recommend it more highly. Just go in with an open mind, allow your body and mind to relax, let go of your need to control everything \u2026 and enjoy your float!"

We were met by the most friendly staff that explained how everything works and eased our minds about any worries or concerns we had. The place was super clean and decorated very nicely. The place had a vibe that made me feel very calm and worry free which was perfect for getting me relaxed before the float.During the float I was able to let go right away before the first 10 minutes of music was over. The tank was very futuristic and bigger than I expected. After letting go, all time disappeared and I was in a weightless and thoughtless state for the whole time until the music came back on at the end of the session. After showering and moving in the chill room I sat in the massage chair for even more relaxation as the staff joined me and helped me interpret what had just happened. All pain in my back was gone as well as the migraine that I had prior to arriving AT Bangkok float Center. I purchased a membership that makes the float very affordable and will be repeating this every week as the staff told me it gets better with practice. Thanks and see you next time! -Kat"

Then, the hall space is bright and nicely decorated. The staff explain to me how it works, take her time and replied to all my questions. She made sure I was feeling comfortable with everything before starting. The place and especially the bathroom were perfectly clean. The experience of floating is amazing. The body is totally relaxed within seconds. It's so comfortable! (even more comfy than a bed!) at some point, I caught myself thinking I wish this is not going to stop soon... it's so good! I really enjoyed that it was total silence, not one noise got to the room, and totally dark. It puts your mind in perfect condition. And you have the option of turning on a light or calling for help at anytime and you are in control of the door, so you do not worry. Afterwards you have this total relaxation feeling in the mind and in the body which stays with you for hours... absolutely amazing, I was totally impressed! Also, I work a lot on the computer and have regular pain in my shoulders. I did not have it since the floating and it's been days now. I will go back for the kindness of the staff, the cleanness of the place, the perfect silence and the amazing long effect... definitively!"

Eed at the front desk is welcoming and helpful, informing me about what I needed to know and ensuring that I was prepared.I cannot adequately place it in my mental schema--perhaps it may be compared to the practice of meditation, but it remains a new experience in and of itself. One can lose track of time while in the pod. With the lights off, earplugs in, and temperature-differential calibrated exactly, being inside the pod is truly the epitome of sensory-deprivation."

The place was a little out of the main part of Bangkok so I would definitely print out the directions in Thai to give to your taxi driver. On both of my visits, neither taxi driver spoke English but read the directions I gave them and took me there without hassle. The cost of the taxi from Udom Suk BTS station was 100B and the return fare to that station was 80B."

I think that was the most important part for us first timers.After careful explanation and reassurance, the rest fell into place. We did an hour each (wish we did longer to be honest), with 2 people going in separate tanks/rooms at a time. When in the tank, it was pretty great. Very relaxing being able to let everything go.When not in the tank, just as relaxing because the waiting rooms had massage chairs, soft furniture, and refreshments.This is a must stop sort of place. Great price, excellent service, and you get more than enough value. Cannot wait to return."

A great feeling of lightness and peace lasted the entire night and into the next day!the tank is a lightless, soundproof tank inside which subjects float in salt water at skin temperature.It's completely dark and feels like nothing.. like not having a body in an awesome way!I think the 1st time is important and cant say how good the reception was. We went with 3 guys and were received by Donovan. I think him being the owner and receptionist, host is on itself a success formula. The man is inviting, stress free, friendly and extremely knowledgeable about floating. He takes a lot of time to go over all the things. From physical to mind-stuff but keeps it open fo you so you start the experience in a stressful and peaceful mindset-environment! perfect! He has been a monk in thailand too so the information can go on from floating to meditation to thailand. A very very welcoming place!Before the float you can read books on floating or mindwork, have a masage in an amazing chair, listen to music or try some different teas.. all perfect! At 1st I thought the location wasnt ok but it's perfect. BTS can bring you and just a taxiride from there or just taxi all the way. My mind was so relaxed that I think it's perfect it's not in silom or sukumvit because you have a bit of time to adapt to city life again before you go full on bkk again.

Jack spent over 20 minutes with me before the session, explaining everything patiently, answering all my questions. The float itself was a very unique experience. You can see nothing, hear nothing (except your own heartbeat and breath), smell nothing and feel very little but the water around your body. I totally lost the sense of time and could not believe how quickly the 90 minutes passed. Unfortunately my thought processes did not slow down much - but Jack says that is common during the first float and it improves a great deal in the 2nd float and thereafter. Then the mental and spiritual benefits begin to kick in. But I had to leave Bangkok the next day so could not go back. I would recommend budgeting for 2 floats at least . Go at 930 am to avail of the 25% discount . The place is spotlessly neat and clean and well maintained as written in the previous reviews"

After 35 years of curiosity, I climbed into one of the state-of-the-art sensory deprivation pods at Bangkok Float Center \u2026 and it was 90 minutes of weightless blissfulness. Ever since I watched the cult classic film 'Altered States' as a 9-yr-old boy, the subject of sensory deprivation has fascinated me. Big shout out again to Donavan Suwanapal and Bangkok Float Center for bringing me to this profound state of relaxation I am in right now. I can not possibly give a higher level of recommendation; a truly amazing and memorable experience from start to finish. DO NOT HESITATE."

The place is clean, comfortable, with state of the art equipment. You come in and immediately feel welcome. Donovan (the owner) is professional and friendly. He takes the time to get to know you while explaining the process that is floating. It's mostly ex-pats that are all looking for the same thing. Whether it be relaxation, spiritual connection, problem solving or just a deeper understanding of themselves. It's one of those rare environments where you come to get better. It's a great experience from when you enter the door till you exit.As far as floating itself. Best advice is leave the expectations at the door and let go. Let go of all those thoughts and lose yourself in the experience. And stick with it! It seems like every time I go back, the float gets a little more personal and deeper.Only draw back is the location is a bit hard to find at first, but well worth finding."

The pricing structure was very clear and affordable, so with short notice I contacted the operator via email to request more specific info. The owner, Donavan, was very helpful setting up our appointments just a couple of days before our arrival.Location and FacilityWe booked a hotel in the area, locating the center and access from the road or freeway was very easy. In this part of Bangkok taxis use the meter and are reasonably priced, so no bad experiences with transport or returning to our hotel or shopping. The building and facilities appear brand new. The reception and waiting areas are on par with mid- to high-end spas, with aquarium, sound system, refreshments, etc. the pods, toilets and private areas were cleaned after each use. No issues or complaints regarding hygiene and service.ConsultationWithou Donavan's \"hand holding\" through the process I don't know if my partner would have done three floats. He is the owner, yet also a very mellow and relaxed float consultant. I consider him a relaxation consultant as one feels better just being in his presence. He prepared the rooms and our expectations with absolutely no pressure to sell us on anything more than we requested. Float experienceThe float itself was a top notch experience. The pod was new and comfortable. As an experienced meditator, it was amazing. I found that I was able to reach stages of meditation usually accessible only after 45+ minutes of concentrated seated meditation. It was wonderful and my 90 minute floats flew by.Post-floatComing out of your first floats is a bit like returning to the boat after a great scuba dive, you are glowing and benefit from a transition period to fully digest the experience. Again, there was plenty of comfort and refreshments available in the center. We never felt pressure to leave immediately to make room for other clients as appointments are spaced adequately. Donavan provided a de-briefing to help us get the most out of our next floats. Again, a top notch experience without sales pressure or strangeness. ConclusionA terrific experience with great consulting and facilities. We travel through BKK fairly often and will use Bang Na as our base to float again. Thanks Donavan!"

            "review": "The Journey Inward. I've been floating on and off for the past 7 years, originally starting in NYC. In 2014 my family and I moved to Bangkok. I got the itch to start floating again and surprisingly enough Bangkok Float Center was only 15 minutes from my house. The LocationA few weeks passed before I went to check it out. As someone who has floated before I knew what to look for and what questions to ask. And Bangkok Float Center has it all and then some. There are two tanks, one on each floor. Each floor has a private bathroom and a lounge to relax in after your float. You can hang out and reflect back on your experience, draw pictures, read books, write, talk with the owner, or simply leave. The Tanks As opposed to the room-style tank I floated inside in NYC, the tanks at Bangkok Float Center are pod-style tanks. At first I was concerned that the experience would be different, but almost immediately upon entering the tank I was brought back to that familiar feeling of being weightless in the void, deprived of all sensory input. The tanks are also quite large. At 6'3'' I find the inside to have plenty of space for my broad frame. And after the initial ping-ponging stops I rarely touch the walls. On top of that the condensation level is very low. There is no dripping of water from the top of the tank. Hitting walls and being interrupted by dripping water is one sure way of being pulled out of a deep float. These tanks cause neither of these problems.The Experience Floating is a completely subjective experience. The tank will show you what you need to know, if you allow it to. It's not wise to go in with expectations so I won't talk about my personal experiences here. I will say this, if you're curious about the tank for the physical benefits, it's amazing on the body. Although I float more for the mental aspect, it does help my sciatica and herniated disk. And the salts work wonders on the body. SummaryLife--Bangkok especially--is filled with too much stimuli. Sometimes we need to unplug and listen to ourselves and figure things out with a truly free mind and detached mind. The tank is perfect for this. Whether you're passing though Bangkok as a tourist or living here full-time, I see no reason not to stop by Bangkok Float Center and give it a try."

As for the location, it's super easy to find which is a big plus for Bangkok and probably the quietest place you'll ever find in Bangkok (the tank that is!)."

First stepped in ..very warm welcome from the owner,Donavan with very comfortable atmosphere. I was amazed at his scientific explanation about what a Sensory Deprivation Chamber can help people's health as I am a doctor I totally agree with him and also believe and understand that it has million medical benefits :* The pressure of gravity is taken off the joints and muscles and the body as a whole is put in to a high state of physical relaxation, with blood pressure and oxygen intake reduced but at the same time blood flow and the distribution of red blood cells increase. The combined effects are of particular benefit to athletes, speeding recovery from injury and assisting in the flushing of lactate, cortisone and adrenaline that may have built up either through training or performance.* Floatation has been shown to loosen the muscles and give athletes a greater degree of control over their nervous systems. This reduces the risk of injury during training or competition. * Floatation not only accelerates the recovery process, but releases vast quantities of endorphins, the body\u2019s natural painkiller.* Floating resets the body\u2019s chemical and metabolic balance, thus reducing the risk of over training.* Promotes total calm, peaceful relaxation, eliminates fatigue and jet lag, improves sleep, alleviates stress- mental and physical, energises, rejuvenates and revitalises.* Stimulates left/right brain synchronisation; shifts brain waves from Beta to lower frequency Alpha, Theta and even Delta, creates mental clarity, alertness, increases creativity, problem solving, heightens visualisation, deepens meditation, expands awareness, intensifies acuteness of all the senses, accelerates learning.* Enhances hypnotherapy and self-hypnosis; increases motivation, diminishes depression, anxiety and fear, facilitates freedom from habits, phobias and addictions.* Improves athletic performance and helps prevent sports injuries and speeds the healing process.* Decreases the production of Cortisol, ACTH, Lactic Acid and Adrenaline, Increases production of endorphins, quickens rehabilitation and recovery, relieves pain- arthritis, migraines, injuries etc., boosts immune function.* Improves circulation and distribution of oxygen and nutrients; reduces blood pressure, pulse, heart rate and oxygen consumption.Conclusion : It's amazingly fascinating!!!! <3 <3"

            "review": "First-time. When I first walked in to Bangkok Float Center, the first things I noticed were the elaborate characteristics of everything. For example, I noticed when I entered the building was the \"spa like\u201d feeling you get as soon as I walked through the door. There is a great amount of calmness aka \"feng shui\" (fung shway) from the designs of the wall paper color, the color of hardwood floors, the cool fish tank on the middle of the floor, the nice comfortable couches to sit on when signing the papers at the front desk, and lastly the smell. For me it had a good calming smell to it... I hope it will be the same for you.Next, the owner of the company, Donavon, stepped from around the corner and met us in the front lobby area and sat down next to us on the big chairs and started to make small talk with us. I had the intentions of wanting a great experience and already had several years of online research under my belt prior to this first float of mine, so I knew what I was getting myself into. So I had a positive vibe going in, and was not guarded or defensive to chat with Donavon. I would suggest having that type of feeling as well. Be open to chatting with Donavon about anything and everything. I would suggest not having plans to be anywhere after the float so you can take your time getting to know him and talking about any questions you may have prior to the float. That's what I did, and that's how I found out Donavon is a pretty cool guy.Another major part that I liked about Donavon, is his honesty. During one part of our conversation, he mentioned, \u201cfor you Ben, you might not have a good experience b/c you already did your research and watched hours of videos of people's floats, and are looking forward to having those type of experiences. So your expectation levels are set high. Now your girlfriend who doesn't know what a sensory deprivation tank is better suited b/c she has no idea what to expect, so she has an unbiased view... so for you Ben, if your first float isn't what you expect, the second float will have much greater results than the first.\u201d I appreciated his honesty, he is a business man and needs to make money to keep his business open, but he said to me, \u201cyour expectations are high and you might not get what you are hoping for, but the second time will be much greater than the first.\u201d His sincerity was so easy to read. Another part were his honesty shines through, he said, \u201cFor first time floaters, I don't make them pay before they float, because if I do, they will only purchase 1 float. So I wait until after they had the float, to decide if they want to purchase \u201cpackage float sessions\u201d because there's quite a bit of savings rather than buying single floats... plus first time floaters are now educated in what a float truly offers and I would hate to make them buy a single float before they float and then when they are done they can't take advantage of the package float sessions.\u201d I appreciated his honesty, as I said before, he is a business man and needs to make money to keep his business open, but yet his sincerity about wanting customers to be truly educate was so easy to read in his body language and tone of voice when he said that. When was the last time you met the owner of a company who still cares about wanting to provide the best to his or her customers???After we finished talking, Donavon showed us the facilities. We walked upstairs to the second floor and there was another peaceful living-room(foyer) type area to relax in. Then he walked us into another room located off to the right. When we opened the door to this second room, there waiting before us was the top-of-the-line-tank that is available on the market. The names of these tanks are called 'Dream Pods'. When the lid is open on the pod, different colored neon lights randomly change colors while your waiting to 'get into' the pod and 'close the lid'.Now inside this room Donavon is explaining to you the correct way of enter the pod, and 'what to do while in the pod' and 'what not to do, while in the pod.' (this is very important to listen, b/c a mistake can cost you $1000 USD to replace)After he finishes explaining everything to you, he leaves the room and you can then secure the door to be closed. Then do what he says and enjoy your experience in the 'Dream Pod.'"

I have been living and working in Bangkok for almost 5 months, and I was really missing floating--an experience I had come to enjoy very much in Canada. I was thrilled to learn that my new city offers the same service! I have floated a total of about 6-7 times before trying the Bangkok Float Center, so I have something to compare this place to. I was super impressed with the cleanliness and overall decor of the establishment. Everything is luxury-spa style. There are two rooms, each on its own floor, complete with a foyer, couch, books, refreshments, get-ready mirror and bathroom supplies like contact solution, hair dryer, etc. The tank itself is in its own room, with a private bathroom and shower. The rooms are huge, clean, and dark--a great environment for pre- and post-floating. The dream pod is state-of-the-art, with its body temperature water, soft blue light, and accompanying music--you can choose to have it throughout the duration of the float, at the beginning and end of the float, or not at all--your preference. The experience within the tank, for me, was relaxing and totally worth the trip. For anyone who has not floated, some of the benefits of the experience include: relaxation, decreased stress, help with joint pain, immunity boost, reset sleep cycle, meditative aspects, tranquility, and an overall sense of euphoria. I have even heard of athletes using their time in the tank to visualize plays or movement patterns to make them better players in their game. When it came to getting there: living in Bangkok didn't put me ahead of any travelers, insofar as knowing how to navigate the city. However, Donovan (the owner of Bangkok Float Center) was more than helpful! Over the course of 3 phone calls, while we were still in transit, he was able to direct me and my friend to his shop using his seemingly-photographic descriptions of the surrounding area. The cost of the float package was 3000 baht for 6 hours--a very good deal. Included in the price is a handsome black t-shirt, the float itself, and access to water/coffee/tea/refreshments. The only issue I had was that the credit card payment option was not yet set up (but luckily, I thought to bring cash with me as well!). For anyone who is interested in this service, I would wholeheartedly recommend it for you! Donovan will take good care of you while you visit his shop. You will not regret it!"

            "review": "John C. Lilly would be proud. Though Sensory Deprivation Tanks are not technically new and have begun to successfully integrate in the modern spa, relaxation experience, they are still somewhat shrouded in mystery and apprehension. In most places, the average dollar per mystery is pretty high and the enlightening experience that these tanks give is out of reach for the every day college student. In the United States it is rare to find a spa offering floats for a similar price and still receive the attention that this Float Center gives.Bangkok Float Center is located a nice distance from the distractions of busy downtown Bangkok but still close enough to a BTS station to be reachable.Without going into too much detail, the center is vibrant and modern with an air of simplicity and minimalism befitting a spa of its type. It caters to every want a person could ask for when \"debriefing\" from their float, offering free coffee, tea, snacks and various creature comforts. As the practice of floating is common with artists, writers and other creative minds, the \"debriefing\" room also has a writing pad to let the mind project.The owner, Donovan, is a fantastic guy who understands the ins and outs of the process of floating. If you have any questions, concerns or apprehensions he will happily help. For a first time float, I wouldn't choose any other place."

Firstly, there was no trouble getting a parking space and the location is just superb in the way that it is away from the hectic part of the city. Entering the place, it has a calming vibe to it and it's just relaxing whether you're just sitting there waiting or floating in the pod. One of the really great thing is everything has been prepared for you from shower lotion and shampoo all the way to earplugs and contacts solutions. There was nothing I had to prepare which made the whole experience even more enjoyable.In terms of experience, I don't think there's a second place in Bangkok which offers such an option. Floatation had really help me relieve my stress and contributes to my improved sleep. I feel more calm after it as well. Would like to recommend everyone to try it at least once.Last but not the least, I have to mention that Mr. Donavan who manages the place is just extremely friendly and supportive. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience there as well as the support from him."

            "review": "Blew. My. Mind.. I've wanted to try a sensory deprivation tank since watching 'Altered States' back in the '80's.This desire was reawakened a short while ago by Joe Rogan. I live in Hong Kong & was planning a birthday trip for my partner when I discovered this float centre in Bangkok. I had to try it & knew Tracey would enjoy the experience. I easily booked two 90 minute float sessions for us via the website & was asked to arrive 15 minutes early to be briefed. We were both first time floaters. We were about 10 minutes late but Donovan, the owner, explained that the client who'd booked to follow us had just called & cancelled, which meant that our session time wouldn't be shorter than planned. Donavan made us feel very welcome & gave us some helpful tips for our time in the pod. We have some meditation skills, which I knew would help us relax in the pods, as well as contribute to a more fulfilling experience. After showering I stepped into the pod & after a few clumsy minutes adjusting to the new sensation of being weightless in a pod of water, I closed the lid, & switched off the lights.I began to focus on my breathe & was rewarded with a new and mind-blowing experience. As I relaxed into my focus, I was amazed at how loud my own breathing sounded. I then became intently conscious of my heart beat & could feel the blood surge around my body enabling me to actually feel my own brain. I could feel it's shape & profile through the pulsing of my blood . . . ! It seemed to extend in size beyond the boundary of my skull & as I wondered at this I felt wave after wave of relaxation pulse over my body, from my brain to my toes. Just when I thought I couldn't possibly become more relaxed, another pulse flowed down my body releasing tension - I perforated a disc in my lower back in a wake-boarding incident 15 years ago & have always carried a lot of tension in my back since. So this was excellent. As I wondered how much more relaxed I could become, I must have then slept for I felt myself emerge into consciousness feeling more excited & energised than I have felt for a very long time. I remember thinking that I must have fallen asleep, & I recall Donavan stating that you'll know when your session is complete, the same way that you can awaken from sleep not knowing what time it is, but knowing you've had enough rest. I attempted to relax further but was far too stoked. I knew the session wasn't over but now I was just fidgeting around in the tank. So, I climbed out, had a shower, & went downstairs to establish how long I had been in the tank. I actually had to ask Donavan if I'd only been in for 15 minutes, or whether I had been in longer. He laughed stating that I had 8 minutes left of my 90 minute session . . . Mind. Blown!So, I sat on the couch, drank some water, & talked to Donavan about my experience while waiting for Tracey to emerge from her session, which she also thoroughly enjoyed. I felt calm, my body felt relaxed, & I slept very well that night. We're both very keen to float again . . . & again. At the earliest opportunity.From my research, I understand that each float session improves upon the last. I highly recommend floating to everyone. Thank you Donavan!"

Before my float, Donovan, the owner, spent some time giving me some helpful tips for when I was in the pod. He was able to answer all my questions, and he was very open in telling me about his own float experiences, which I appreciated. He also spend some time introducing me to the 'Dream Pod' which was very important for me; at first the idea of closing yourself into a pod/tank can be intimidating, but he explained exactly how it works, and I became confident that the pod would be very safe and easy to use. I have always enjoyed yoga and meditation, and I think having some experience with meditation made this an even more amazing experience for me. Being weightless was a new and incredible experience in itself. As I started to relax more, I felt my heart beat slow down, and I was able to let my mind go. I felt some spots of long-held tension in my shoulders start to release. The only thing I heard for the whole hour and a half was my own breathing, which made it even easier to connect to my own mind and body. This was a very unique, introspective, and gravity-defying experience.After the floating experience, your mind can take some time to adjust to the outside world again, so right outside the float rooms, there's a comfy couch where you can sit, read, draw, journal, enjoy some drinks and snacks, and process your float before going back into reality! After my float I felt very calm, and I slept great that night. In the following days, I had a lot of energy and my body felt great all around. I'd love to back again, as I hear that your float gets better and better each time. I'd recommend this to anyone!"

Besides, the manager (Donovan) is a very kind guy who even came to pick me up with his car when I got lost looking for the place. You will enjoy talking to him.During the float, I managed to concentrate more on my meditation than ever before and the feeling of relaxation that came afterwards was amazing. It is highly recommendable and if you try it once, you will definitely go back for a second or third float.In case you are locking for a unique experience, go visit the Bangkok Float Center, you will be glad you did ;) And tell Donovan I said hi"

I had some cool floating experiences inside too which made it 100% better. If you are here on holiday or an expat living in Bangkok I would suggest everyone to try this at least once.

Being into meditation and experiencing the sensations of the inner worlds, I really looked forward to try the float tank - and I was not disappointed in any ways.I was met by the owner, a down to earth, calm and friendly guy who made the total experience just perfect. Very easy to relax around, giving a good picture of some of the distressing and calming benefits of floating, since he floats every day - If only I could do the same : )The facilities are simple, welcoming, clean and calm. I was taken through the process in a very understandable manner, and then left to take a shower before starting my 90min session.The first notice I took, lasted throughout the entire session - It's so relaxing, unlike anything else. After a while, the body started going into a dreamlike state whilst I was still alert and could enjoy the relaxation as well as feeling a widening of my consciousness - This in a kinda \"non Efford mode\", no stress from sounds, lights, back pains and general discomfort one may experience during a sitting meditation. I have spend a great deal of time meditating, which properly gave me a some advantages - but clear the float in itself will have a profound effect for people in early states of meditating practice or even for total novices. It \"shows\" you the way, as long as you give in to the water, relax totally and just concentrate on breathing.Even though my focus is on the inner experience, one could easily go for simply just having a total new and relaxing experience - it kinda resets the body, and shows the way to a less tense and more relaxed feel that your body will remember and call upon when needed.I hope to float more before leaving BKK, and in general : )"

It was peaceful, quiet and the staff were very friendly. While it was difficult to find (down the street from Pullman G Hotel) by tuk tuk, it was worth the hassle.The massage started with the typical washing of your feet and then we were escorted upstairs to the massage room. Once inside, we were asked to change clothes to a traditional top and matching Thai fisherman pants. Once dressed, we laid on a cushion on the floor. I previously asked for medium pressure, but quickly asked for strong pressure. The massage wasn't the type of Thai massage that I was accustomed to and I fell asleep several times.(Typically, I do not fall asleep during a Thai massage since it is full body engagement.) However, it was still nice to receive a two hour massage for only 720 baht per person.If you are in the area, I definitely think it is worth the visit."

So glad we did and also we were delighted that it rated highly on trip advisor. This place is spacious, modern , very western with a Thai touch. The girls all speak enough english to get by and understand and talk about treatments and the girls at the reception are professional and efficient. The whole place runs like a well-oiled machine, on time start and finish and great daily specials. So much better than many many places in Australia. The quality of the treatments was also first class, my husband had foot Massage and then back and shoulder treatments , I had a manicure and pedicure and she took all the time needed to make them look fantastic. Properly trained girls who know what they are doing. Highly recommended. There are hundreds of places to have these treatments done all around you, many have the girls sitting out in the heat looking depressed, Dahra looks like the place you would go to back at home and this counts for a lot. It is busy and that\u2019s because its good."

It was the friendly Thai lady sitting on the corner of a nondescript street where our tuk tuk driver dropped us when we were on our way to Dahra. We were looking for the place and she was more than happy to point out that it wasn't the best place to go to. I asked why and that was what she said. Being skeptical tourists (there are pros and cons, of course), we were not sure if she was being honest or just trying to get us to another spa. She recommended another spa but when we asked her where the place is, she said, \"It is very farr from there.\" Okay. Not so encouraging especially when it was rush hour.So we said bye to her (she had the nicest smile ever) and thought we should just give Dahra a try considering that we already made our booking. We went in, waited for a bit (minus points for that) and 1.5 hours later, came out agreeing 100% with the lady. Yes, the session was good and the price was right but would I go there again? Nope."

My friend and i booked a Full Spa Treatment and were delighted to see that it was a 50% discount for booking online. On arrival the place was very busy with walk-ins and booking ready to be served. The receptionist was lovely and tried her best to pay attention to us as we waited patiently. The Full Spa Treatment includes a facial, wrap, scrub and massage. We started with a facial. My friend and I were placed in the same room, lucky, as her face started burning from the cream and I asked that instead of a facial she get a foot massage. My facial was average at its best and the lady left for extended periods of time for the hour. We ended up walking out after the facial and substitute massage due to lack of attention, bright lights and too much noise. We will not return. Too many other great options to even give this place a second chance."

All correspondence was dealt with efficiently and professionally. On the day of the first appointment, though, when checking my emails I realised that I had managed to book it for the day before! We quickly contacted the spa just 15 mins before the appointment to see if they could fit us in, and set off on our way as we thought that it would be a nice walk in any case even if we couldn't get the treatments. As soon as we arrived, the receptionist knew that it was us and welcomed us kindly. She had just had a call from the manager who saw my email, and they had managed to get ready for us (a one-hour foot massage for both of us) in the 15 mins! She didn't make me feel silly about my booking error either. The foot massage was amazing, and really relaxing after our day of shopping. We returned the day after for the combo treatment of back and neck massage followed by a thai all-body massage. Again this was set up as a couples massage, and was relaxing yet firm. The welcome drink and after treatment drink were both great, too. We were fully aware that we could get massages cheaper than at Dahra, but for a professional service, and a proper spa-feel, we thought that it was excellent value when booked online, and would highly recommend Dahra to anyone staying in the Silom area!"

I had a two hour \"combination massage\" with Ning, and now I don't want to leave Bangkok. I asked for it \"strong\" and several time during the massage I thought I may have to ask her to lighten-up, but I stuck it out, and glad I did. Ning was fantastic. Luckily my tour returns here in a week, so I'll get another opportunity for bliss. It felt like every muscle and tissue was being rearranged, which was exactly what I needed. If you don't like it strong, you can go either mild or medium."

You are basically naked the whole time which was no big deal but some may not be comfortable with this as you are asked to shower between treatments which can be awkward going from shower to massage table again and again. Definitely will be back but might try couples massage or something"

It was good and very cheap, although they didn't ask me if I wanted to take off my bulky sweater before and I got a little bit hot during the massage. It was strange that they brought in multiple other people during my massage in the shared room, but fine since I paid less than $10 for a half hour.I went back the next day for a full body massage- the room was private (separated by curtains from other rooms) and the massage was good and professional. I love thai massage where they stretch you- it's like yoga without having to do any of the work! I think the hour long full body was around $12.I would definitely go back!"

The facility looks and feels very new, clean, and posh (check out the jacuzzi in the couples' room!)Now the service - I loved the scrub & the wrap, but I don't rate the facial and massage highly... There was an unpleasant sensation during the facial session (possibly due to the product used?), and I felt that the therapist wasn't exactly well-versed in giving facials. The massage wasn't \"strong\" enough for me and my partner (despite requesting for it), and my masseuse didn't ask me which area to focus on...It's not the best spa experience I've had in Bangkok, but considering the price I paid - it is quite a bargain."

This spa is calm and soothing and my therapist was excellent with all treatments. The only flaw is the lack of a bathroom on the second floor, where the treatment rooms are, and also a smell of mildew in the showers.

I went with the Full Spa Treatment which included a body scrub, body wrap, aromatherapy massage, and a facial. You can choose from 5 different products to use with your body scrub and wrap depending on what results you'd like; I recommend the white sesame and yoghurt for the scrub and honey milk for the wrap. What I love most about is this place is the zen vibe and attentive staff who always checks if it's the right temperature for this, or are they being too rough on that. And when my legs became numb during the facial after hours of lying down and being pampered, the lady noticed and gave me a complimentary leg massage which made it disappear.So for only 2500 baht (as part of their promotional period), I received all of that and more, so prepare to give them a big tip because it's amazing value and they truly deserve it! :) "

I wish I had read the bad ones first.I purchased the 50% off full spa package.Firstly, my app was at 10, I got there at about 15 minutes early, and no one was there. I went in and sat on the couch and waiting till someone came in. She Told me I was too early and showed me the time on her phone and was so rude!Next, I find it very unprofessional and uncomfortable having someone massage my breasts and buttocks, even after I asked them not to. Also, the 'massage' was 90% rubbing my legs and the remaining 10% spread between back shoulders And breasts. Terrible massage. The lady spent the time telling me about her hard life as a factory worker prior to this job and how her husbands a tXi driver. I thought she was just being nice and making conversation until the end of the treatment when she said 'did u enjoy'? And I felt obliged to say yes. Then she said ok u give me til now. Not let me tell you, for the price I paid for this experience and the 'quality' that I was promised I found it extremely unprofessional to ask for money off me, let alone 500 baht! As soon as I got back to hotel I showered for an hour to try and get clean feeling again.So disappointed.The only good thing was that the girls at reception desk helped me get a taxi back to my hotel which was nice of them.The only good thing was that the"

Best decision ever!The place is well located, easy to find. Staff very welcoming, a large selection of treatments available. We reserved but you can even go without, they do their best to accommodate drop-ins. The premises are very clean, they even wash your feet before your massage starts. The massage itself was more than perfect! They ask you how strong you want it and then they truly adapt to your needs. It lasted one hour and afterwards we felt like we were floating, no traces of jetlag or plane tiredness. Had other massages while in Thailand but nothing came close to this.Prices are very reasonable! Not to be missed."

I was backpacking in Aus and NZ and was waiting until I got to Thailand for a much needed massage since I knew it would be very cheap. I googled spas and Dahra spa came up. From booking online I scored an incredible deal of 50% off. I booked literally the day prior, received a response within hours, and I did not have to give them any credit card info up front. The spa was easily visible from the street and google maps was able to give me accurate information to walk to the spa. The interior was lovely and exactly what you would expect from a high class spa. Quite a change from the outside streets! From start to finish I had a lovely experience. I booked the full spa treatment which included a full body scrub, wrap, aromatherapy massage, facial and I think a few more treatments. It lasted 4 hours. The spa has several treatments and combinations to choose from. I have never indulged myself with such a thorough day at the spa before! The price for all these treatments would have easily cost $300-500 in the US and I paid less than the cost of one of these treatments on its own. Despite the low price the quality of my treatments and the ambiance was equal to any 5 star resort spa. I would recommend this spa to anyone looking for a Spa day in Bangkok. And please remember to bring extra bhat to tip your wonderful therapist."

Booking was fairly easy online and they have the essentials at great prices (this is a mid-range spa). My husband booked a shoulder/head massage, and I booked the shoulder/head and Thai massage. They were very accommodating in terms of providing more private rooms (for couples, it's one room with a curtain divider). The facilities were clean and dimly lit for a very relaxed feel. From what I can remember, you cannot hear any street noise even though it's located on a busy street. The massage I received was excellent and a good medium deep pressure. Note that it can be a little hard to communicate with the masseuse as depending on who you get, their English can be very limited. But overall a wonderful experience, reasonable prices, great friendly customer service and great technique. After an hour of pulling, stretching, kneading... I was definitely relaxed. Bonus: Considering my medium/deep massage, no bruising afterwards! I would definitely return and try their other services!"

Before the trip to Bangkok I did some research and found Dahra on Tripadvisor. Overall, the experience was very good. Email enquiries and bookings before our trip were responded to promptly and we were confirmed a couple's room. We booked the \"Full Spa Treatment\" which was 4900 Baht for two after 50% discount (+ 3% surcharge if paying by credit card), which consisted of a wrap, scrub, massage and facial. To put the price into perspective the W bliss spa was doing a \"90 minute head to toe\" promotion at 5000 Baht for two + 17% tax. The walk from the W was short since both the hotel and spa are close to BTS Chong Nonsi station.Of course, it is the treatments that mattered and I was more than satisfied by my choice of a coffee scrub and sesame wrap (there are a myriad of choices to choose from). Massage and facials were also very good and the therapists took our strength preferences into account. Our treatment started at 8pm and finished just after midnight. We were so relaxed that we decided to take the taxi home.Despite this I am hesitant to give it 5 stars as these kinds of spas are ubiquitous in Bangkok and there was not anything particular unique or special about Dahra that wowed us. They just did a very professional service at a very reasonable price. However, I would definitely recommend it for people who are staying in and around the Silom area."

Even though we had been recommended various day Spas by concierge at our hotel- we checked a couple out and went with our gut instinct in choosing Dahra. It was a very good decision. I had a package that was around 3 3/4 hours long and it was bliss. It included a mask, a honeymilk wrap, an exfoliating treatment, a full body massage and a facial. My boyfriend had a two hour massage and a facial. We both came away feeling wonderful and relaxed after these treatments. We didn't use the day spa facilities as such, only the treatments on offer but we both wholeheartedly recommend Dahra. Both of our ladies were so kind and professional and were polite in kindly speaking to us in English to make us feel welcome. For around \u00a3100 for all of these treatments- you would be crazy not to do it! We of course gave them a generous tip for their great work. It is easy to find and a gem of a place."

I was very well greeted by a friendly receptionist and soon I got a cold towel and a refreshing glass of water. The whole place have a warm and welcoming feeling about it, nice colors, furnitures and it smelled really good aswell. I went upstairs to the massage room and got a shower before my session. The room was nicely furnished and very tidy with a big shower. I told my massager that I have problem with my neck and shoulders from an old car accident and would like her to put some extra attention to that. It was very relaxing with some nice background music that was just perfect, I also liked the fact that the AC was quite and I felt very well taken care of. The quality of massage would was very good and she did some extra work on my shoulders and neck. 1,5 hours fly by and my time was up. After a nice cup of Tea it was time to pay. There was some promotion and I paid 1600 thb for what would have cost 2,5 times as much in one of the major hotel spas. Sometimes I go to one of the street massages for a footmassage, but I can certainly recommend Dahra for anyone that likes real quality at a fair price. I will comeback for sure.Fredrik Sweden"

Admittedly I didn't read all of them, but it was one of the better ones in the area. When I arrived the lobby was nice and everything was clean. I had a late flight and wanted to relax before spending all day on a plane. I deiced on an hour and a half massage and asked if they had showers that I could use after the massage as I had already checked out of my hotel and they said not an a problem.I was taken upstairs to a room towards the back. The room was again clean, it had a shower in room which I was pretty excited about. My massage got started and I was overall disappointed. The oil was nice, but the overall massage wasn't very relaxing. It was like someone was lightly touching my back. She spent a lot time on my legs and only a few minutes on my back. This wasn't what I was expecting considering the price was 3X what I paid in Bali and I had great experience there. After she had me flip over she continued with my legs. She then got a little touchy with her hands. I am not sure if I had indicated that I was looking for a happy ending, but that is what she was trying to do. After I had told her no a few times, I asked her to leave. She told me that I still had 20 minutes left. I showed and left. I didn't even get the full massage that I had paid for. I was very disappointed in the overall situation. I was sure that finding a higher end place I wasn't going to have this happen, however I was clearly wrong.If you are looking for a happy ending, there are cheaper options down the street.You'll know because the guys wont let you walk by without showing you pictures."

We then had our feet washed and led to the rooms on the 3rd floor to change into loose shirt/pants. The entire massage was really enjoyable. You don't hear anyone else chatting and the masseuses kept the conversation to minimal. After about an hour of massage, we had hot herbal stuff applied all over our bodies..and just when we thought it was over, there was more massage! They served tea again after the massage was over.

I have to get dressed and go downstairs for the facial. I was also told to shower right after massage for the facial. Little puzzled as usually shower is not recommended within few hours. The wrap is not hot wrap. As it's hot season I have to ask for some water as I already felt dehydrated before the wrap. She didn't have a straw so I had to drink without hands which was tough since I was already in wrap. Will i return? Maybe. .. But it's not top of my list."

We booked a promotional deal for the Oriental Spa Treatment, which included an herbal treatment, a cream milk treatment, and a scrub, wrap, and massage of our choice. The options were plentiful and varied, from detoxifying green tea to restoring liquorice root. I chose the coffee scrub and the white sesame wrap, both for detoxifying effects, and felt positive results.Unfortunately, we had to be in separate rooms, but hadn\u2019t booked ahead and were happy they could take us. The rooms were clean and spacious, but rather cold. Both of us found the temperatures of not only the air, but also the showers to be uncomfortably cool (and we live in a cold climate). Luckily, we were served hot tea several times, which was wonderfully sweet and warming. The masseuses were extremely professional and friendly.We both felt refreshed and renewed after the three hour experience and would definitely return to this relaxing escape from busy Bangkok."

I have to say that I had the best massage I've ever had this time round!! It is an oasis from the bustling city streets and far superior to any spa I've been to in Bangkok, but still represents outstanding value for money.Special thanks goes to Khun Kwan and Porn for their outstanding skills and service!We'll be back next time we visit Bangkok!"

My massage pressure was very strong, too much for me so my advice woulr be to tell them before what pressure you want in order to avoid bad surprise ad they don't ask you proactively. Overall 400 baht for 1h thai or back and shoulder massage is really cheap compared to the quality of the place and the atmosphere, far from many tourist-massage places where the price is almost the same but the ambience really not relaxed.Tip: book on their website and get 20% discount."

Then she massaged me with coconut oil and wrapped me in a blanket. I was so relaxed I fell asleep! The final massage, which included a facial, was simply luxurious. The aroma, room, atmosphere, massage table, music and lighting were perfect. A shower is in the room so guests can take showers after the scrub and wrap, and at the end if desired.

I must admit, I slept through most of it and only woke up to shower between each treatment. The scrub and wrap smelt lovely - good enough to eat! And the massage must have been relaxing, as I was out for the count. The facial was a little dubious, but I didn't break out in spots afterwards, so it was fine.The setting was nice - mood lighting, clean, with a shower in the room so all very handy.Of course, you can push the boat out and get 5-star service and setting at 5-star prices, but for a mid-range spa, this was great and I would certainly return."

My friend and I took the full spa treatment at 50% as we want to try out all the treatments. I was quite disappointed with the services. First, the facial, I was quite surprised that the therapist did the facial in a very very dim light. Furthermore, we placed our head on the therapist lap! I asked the therapist, can u see in the dark ... she just said \"ok, ok\".Secondly, while working on the body treatments like massage, scrub, wrap ... the therapist didn't take into consideration to at least protect the customer's modesty. The worst was during the the body wrap when the therapist just simply pour the honey milk potion onto my body and roughly/hastily spread it all over my body. I almost like telling her that my body is not a meat to be marinated. In fact when the therapist told me to shower after each body treatment, she just stood there when usually the therapist will leave to give customers some privacy!Last, the aromatherapy massage. I have to agree with some reviewers that you can get better massages at cheaper spas. To be honest, I was really looking forward to the massage as I was really a fan of Thai aromatherapy massage. But the therapist massage techniques was like so different when I thought that it has been standardised. Sorry, but I think this spa is overated!"

We had booked one of their 50% specials and it was just incredible.

I started to chat with her and although her English is not very good, she showed tremendous courage and willingness to learn. I thought that showed her very good positive attitude in doing her job.When encouraged by me to speak more English and thus improving it (I'm fine with chatting), she said that she likes to chit-chat with customers while doing her job too and repeatedly lets me know she feels very happy to be able to communicate with me while doing her job. She respects that some customers would rather just like to sleep though.A really happy-to-serve masseur in a nicely decorated interior with your choice of a relaxing scent (I chose Lavendar)..

She told me absolutely nothing about the treatments or what she was doing.The scrub and wrap were just okay. The massage was TERRIBLE. She never asked about the amount of pressure I wanted or what areas I wanted her to work on. She spent about 10 minutes on my back and the rest was pretty much spent on my legs. I wouldn't even call it a massage; more like a rub. Totally, not relaxing.The facial was okay. Certainly better than the massage. I have no idea if I received the other two treatments listed in the package or not...the herbal food treatment and the cream milk treatment.Upon leaving I could not find the exit from the treatment area to the reception and ended up walking in on a naked man. I was beyond embarrassed. The masseuse was supposed to have waited for me, but instead she was sitting and chatting to the receptionist. The receptionist tried to charge me full price instead of the Internet special of 50% off. (She did offer 20% off of the regular price.) Finally she decided to honor the 50% discount plus an additional 10%.Very disappointed with this place, and I know that there are much better places in Bangkok for massage and spa treatments. The lobby is lovely, but beyond that nothing good worth mentioning."

I enjoyed a 1.5 hours with an oustanding therapist called Toon who was able to listen and adapt the massage to my needs and finally fix my back. I had the opportunity to try 2 other Spas in Bangkok and I have to say that Dahra is the best cost effective option."

We booked the full spa treatment online which was about 3 hours and 45 minutes long, and received a discount of 50%. Good deal!Surprisingly, as it was a Saturday night, I thought that it would be crowded and all but no, we were the only ones there I guess. It was a clean, cozy and peaceful place to be, without any distracting noises. Friendly masseuses, the entire treatment was heavenly. They provided us with hot tea before, during and after treatment, which tasted so good!However, there is one thing I would like to suggest which is to provide eye makeup remover in the room. I had stubborn waterproof mascara and eyeliner throughout the entire treatment. Nevertheless, the facial treatment was great as the masseuse was really gentle with her hands. We would definitely come back again!"

The receptionists are always welcoming and patient and provide a good help in making a choice between the various therapies and massages. The therapists are surely very sensitive, caring and skilled - Usually, I fall asleep halfway through the massage and wake up feeling fresh like a baby.

It's easy to miss because it's quite a small frontage.However, inside it's deceptively spacious and well laid out. The decor is heavy wood and scented oils. The receptionist greeted me in very good English. She recommended a treatment for me - an aromatherapy session. I only had time for an hour, but probably 90 minutes would have been better.The room was spotlessly clean. The temperature was just right as opposed to some other places I've been. There was very quiet music playing in the background and no other distracting noise.The masseuse was very good - she was aware of any pain or twinges. She found the areas with the most knots and kneaded them out. She didn't feel the need to chat incessantly which I find annoying when I'm having a massage.After the treatment, I was given a glass of sweet hot tea, which was very tasty.And the 'happy ending'?There was an introductory discount as they have only just opened, of course."

My husband and i were politely asked to come back in 3 hours, which wasn't problem, then I carefully chose the course and decided to do 'Asian something', which is combined Thai massage and oil massage. The disaster started when i came back to have a massage and met the massage woman. I was put in a room with a shower room. I quickly took shower and waited for more than 5 minutes full-naked. I started to feel really cold in a full air-conditioned room, so i opened the door and see if the woman knows i was waiting. she told me to stay in a room so i did. After another 5 minutes, i felt freezing so i opened the door again. She shouted irritatedly saying ' just morment please!!' 2 minutes later, she came into the room with a mean look and so did I. I didn't understand why I was treated like this. I really wanted to leave. After i was sure she wasn't gonna hurt me, i let her continued the massage. However, I was so cold that i didn't feel anything. First time I told her I was cold, she stopped the air-con, but the room remained cold. Second time i asked her if there was any way to make the room warmer, she said no. She finally gave me a hot compress from next door after 3rd times i told her i was really cold, but there was only 10 minutes left before 90 minute massage ended.Although my husband agreed the room was quite cold, he enjoyed his Thai massage & Hot compress, so I thought it was my woman who didn't know much about hospitality. She told me she had been a massager for 1 year and half. How come one of the best spa in Bangkok hire a inexperienced massager??? My course was the most expensive. I waisted my precious 90 minutes and 2700TBH.She could have tried to make the room warmer in some way......"

From the moment we entered the Spa's door we were treated almost as old friends by the most lovely receptionists. It seemed, right from the moment we entered that we'd reached the right place to receive much needed relief from the urban madness which stretched out for miles around us. Nothing is rushed here and there is an extensive menu of treatments which you are free to browse at your own pace while savouring the thought of being thoroughly pampered just a few moments later. Thus my partner and I decided to escape the madness of midday Bangkok with what was simply described as a \"Head and shoulders massage\". And, we expected it to be good, given the Spa's most opulent ambience, attention to detail and most welcoming hospitality extolled to us on entry. But let's just say that our expectations weren't just exceeded as we were thoroughly satisfied on leaving. Don't miss spending at least an hour or two of your life at Dahra Beauty & Spa.

The spa was recommended by my concierge in the hotel and was within walking distance so i thought id give it a try.When i entered the spa i was surprised by the quality of the decorations, it was more like a luxury home and quite different than any spa i had visited before. The receptionist made me feel very comfortable and i selected the Aromatherapy Hot Oil massage. The masseuse didnt speak as much English as the receptionist but i didnt find that a problem. She was very friendly and performed the treatment in a very professional way. The standard of the room was very high and had a private shower (im not sure if all the rooms do). I am quite ticklish about my feet and have never really enjoyed having them massaged before. However, this lady managed to soothe my aches without making me feel uncomfortable at all. After i finished the treatment my whole body really felt relaxed and i was able to go back to the hotel for a good nights sleep.I visit BKK about once every 3 months. I will definitely be making another appointment next time im in town."

One of the things you have to do when you were in Thailand is to experience thai massage, as we could see many places offer thai massage, but not so many places offer the \"real\" thai massage, when i was in Bangkok, i saw many sign boards that claimed as thai massage places, but for me personally those places more look like bars then a decent thai massage place.I found Dahra Beauty & Spa from a friend, cozy place, positive atmosphere, friendly and helpful staffs. I choose herbal thai massage, it was my first time having thai massage, and i was surprise with the massage technique, it's totally different technique thai massage than the ones that i saw in the beaches. Professional experienced therapist made me feel secure that i m in skillful hand and she really knows what she did, she lifted my arms, my legs, my head, press my back, she's all over the places, by the end of the massage i got my body massage with warm towels that has been steamed with herbal, it smells really good, the closest word that could describe the smell is clean smell, really relaxing, and makes you don't want to open your eyes after the massage session end.I totally can feel the different between before and after thai massage, my body is lighter, more energy and it keeps me in a better mood, and i'm glad to have my first thai massage experience in Dahra Beauty & Spa, otherwise i wouldn't know that there is a special technique of thai massage, not just rubbing and grabbing arms and legs.Well, if you want to experience the \"real\" thai massage, i highly recommend Dahra Beauty & Spa, with an excellent reasonable price and having the experience that could wow you, i think you would say the same things like what i just wrote.Enjoy your trip."

I am not usually one for massages but this has been a wonderful experience of a full body massage - so welcoming, peaceful, restful and refreshing. Now I make sure whenever I am in Bangkok I visit at least once - last visit went twice - such a treat! Family in Bangkok are regular visitors too!"

I was so pleased that in three years the standard is still very high and they are all as lovely as usual. My boyfriend and I had the following;30 minute body scrub- amazing feeling and seriously leaves your skin soft for about 1.5 weeksSignature 1.5 hour treatment- This includes massage, hot stones and facial Love everything about this treatment and every time it has been amazing. I really won't advise anyone to treat themselves to this. 1500 baht (30 gbp) approx for 2 hours is a bargain for this quality of massages and treatment. Thank you to all the ladies there for making it specially for us"

But during the mask there came a really wonderful massage that relaxed my body.So if your in need of a serious facial then it would not be the place. Its more a place to have a massage and relax in this homely environment. Plus one hour is simply not enough, so pick a longer session.Its an easy walk from the bts and enjoyed the stroll over. Also when you call they might not pick up so just try again. "

I honestly don't know why I did not visit before!!! To think of all the restful massages and treatments I have deprived myself off!!This is a beautifully converted old house with lovely staff. I think the owner is also personally involved and takes bookings. The rooms are clean and smell very nice. The treatments are very different from regular treatments. I guess more along the Korean style but I am not an expert on that. We took the facial and massage package and it was just perfect!! My face has never felt so soft in ages - nothing intrusive or harsh was used! Anyway the entire experience was blissful!! I am definitely walking back again"

The facility is a house and a very relaxing environment. I would highly recommend Su Esthetic if you're seeking a spay with great service & value.

I have chosen Summer Treatments using organic coconut oil sea salt scrub, coconut oil massage and facial for 2.5 hours duration. The entire process is wonderful as I enjoy the 3 stages of treatment, relaxing from the way the therapist do the massage which is totally different from others style of massage and satisfying with the quality of material used as I could feel the thickness and smoothness of the coconut oil spreading onto my body. I would say it is an amazing experience couple with the professional work of the therapist working on the entire duration without dropping in standard and quality.If time and space allowed, I will return to try other Korean style of treatments."

Opting for a massage at a Korean spa in Bangkok may not be the most obvious choice ever made given that Thai massage is world-renowned, but do yourself a favour and give this place a try. It's friendly, family-run and has a setting full of character and charm, despite being slightly off the beaten Bangkok track on a little side road that twists and turns and had our cab driver doing his best to guess exactly where we were going. All that said, the journey was hardly harrowing and cost less than 150 baht from our central downtown hotel, so the place is more hidden gem than epic exploration find. Do make the effort. Su Esthetic had been recommended as a \"must do\" while on a brief break to Bangkok, not least because getting massaged in Thailand is one of my wife's favourite pastimes. Monique, the owner, had squeezed us both in at short notice for a basic hour-long massage. She had carefully explained to us how Korean massage differed from traditional Thai massage, seeking to manage potentially unmet expectations. There was no worry on that score as before we'd finished being kneaded and unknotted by tiny Thai women expertly trained in the Korean technique, my wife was already planning her next visit and treatments. Sadly Monique couldn't fit us in before we were due to leave town, so it'll just have to be something we do next time - it's a reason to go back to Bangkok all on its own."

I could not list how many different massages and facial techniques were used, all quickly and efficiently. One thing that is rare to find was done here: with a vacuum machine they quickly removed the blackheads, it only took like 1.5 minutes and was perfectly painless. The warm pillows that were put on my chest and belly immediately had me relax deeply. I booked an appointment a day before on the phone (recommended), and thanks to the map and directions on the site, I found the spa from the BTS station quite easily.

We started with the aroma floral bath which was very soothing and calming.Then, we had the salt scrub which really smooths and nourishes the skin. I loved how soft and smooth my skin felt after the scrub! However, the scrub may not be suitable for people with very thin skin as the grains are really coarse. We then proceeded with our body and facial treatments. We didn't enjoy this experience though. My therapist was rushing to finish the entire treatment. There was no pressure from the massage at all (I'd specifically requested for a medium massage pressure knowing that my body's quite stressed) and everything applied on my face was just cold with no warning. My boyfriend's therapist was quite ok. She applied the right amount of pressure to soothe his tension. However, she may have focused a little too much on his armpits, he suffered from bruises for a couple of days. His face was really cleaned after the facial. I may visit Su Esthetics again as I liked the environment a lot. However, I will definitely not want the same therapists for the treatments."

Thank you so much for the wonderful experience, and I will be back again when I visit Bangkok in the near future."

The masseur exerts adequate strength and checks with you to ensure you're ok. The environment was quiet and peaceful, place was clean and cosy. Don't expect luxurious settings and fittings, just a pleasant home based spa. The room we had was good - not stuffy, spacious enough and temperature set was just nice. We have been to places where it was stuffy and with a faulty aircon that we were perspiring while having the massage.Service was great, making a reservation was a breeze. Monique was prompt in replying to emails and is able to recommend treatments based on one's needs. She explains and ensures that her masseurs are aware of any special request from the customers, making it a pleasant experience for us. She is able to converse in various languages so don't worry about any miscommunications. Just a minor setback is that the procedure seems to be inconsistent - e.g. some of us had certain parts massaged and some of us didn't. Also, on our second visit, one of us felt that the masseur was not as good as the previous and that she left my friend unattended for quite a long period of time during the treatment. Overall, one of the best massage we had, great service and well worth the money."

A bit hard to find, out of the way , but if you use the map and the instructions provided on the website it is an easy walk from BTS.I had the signature facial and massage and the one and half hours of pampering were great value. I particularly like the fact that the staff are so professional and you feel like you are in a very professional , serene environment. Well worth a visit."

I was fortunate enough to visit both spas the same day as they are about 5min walk away from each other and rated very highly here on tripadvisor. Masseuse:The therapist at Su Esthetic was less skilled and experienced as during the scrub session she didn't notice my obvious wound on my back and scrubbed on it hard while I winced in pain.Atmosphere: At Su Esthetic there was renovations being done so it was difficult for me to be relaxed with the pounding of the hammer.Final thoughts:The owner at Su Esthetics seemed to be strictly business during my conversations with her. One will also notice signs in every room indicating a Tip for the therapist.As tipping is a personal choice. (I always tip for good massages) I kind of confused why there were signs everywhere \"reminding\" us to tip."

It was okay not being able to start early as I was too early, but it was rather unexpected that the start time was delayed 10min later than my scheduled time. This, however was a minor minor issue compared to the treatment they provided. email responses were very prompt and easy to arrange an appointment with them. The place was quite some distance from the nearest bts station, but quite easy to find according to the map/instruction provided and its very cosy. I was very sweaty upon arrival and the waiting time allowed me to cool down. And needless to say, the staff was very professional. She tried to make sure I was comfortable as I then requested for a stronger massage. I felt sorry as I could hear her hands/fingers cracking and she said she was okay. It was very relieving and quite relaxing during facial massage that I nearly fell asleep. Very humble people and I highly recommend this cosy place :)"

Only setback I feel is the operator put up several signs at obvious place advising customers to tip the masseurs if they are happy with their services, going to the extend stating 100bath is greatly appreciated. I do usually tip the masseur unless it was really bad. However, in this case, I do feel the unnecessary pressure from the operator abit annoying. Understand some countries service staffs income depends alot on tipping but I don't think Thailand is one of them."

I've had Thai (never sure of the training the masseuse has though), Moroccan and Japanese massage. After checking their web site and calling the owner, I decided to go for it. The special price for the Signaturewas right too. I called the spa and spoke with the owner, a lady from Hong Kong. Her husband is from Canada. She assured me her staff were professional and trained. The experience was relaxing, professional and done in a clean environment. I suppose one could bring their own sheets and towels if they wished. The spa is a bit out of the way, but the directions are easy to follow. The massage is a top to bottom, front and back affair. A caution, if you're a female, you might want to be cautious as to the pressure they apply to your breasts. If one is shy about having the hips and thighs massaged, one might want to mention this to the staff in advance. This isn't a happy endings affair though! As a guy, I was comfortable with the medium pressure massage. The facial was great. I lift weights thus I enjoyed the relaxing feeling the back massage gave me. Based on my experience, I'd recommend if you're serious about a good massage, this is a place to go. See their web site for more info regarding services, prices and location. Relax and enjoy yourself."

I took up the signature treatment (inc. of facial) and korean scrub. Very relaxing, and enjoyed it very much.

I was recommended SuEsthetic by friends, which me and my other half decided to check out in April 2015 (did not leave a TripAdvisor comment last time as I did not have an account yet). My account all setup now so by a stroke of luck I had another trip to Bangkok in June 2015 so I called them up to see if there were any availability slots. It was a fluke there were one or two no shows so they were able to accommodate me and my friends.The experience is a must try from the second you walk into the spa, you are greeted with warm smiles. Then they sit you down with a glass of water to cool you down after getting to the spa (it\u2019s a short walk but with the Bangkok weather, it\u2019s hot) She (Monique) will then share with you the types of treatments they have available. I took the 1.5 hours signature face and body, it was very relaxing and the masseuse checks on you to make sure the strength being used isn\u2019t too strong, as not everyone can\u2019t take it. I requested for the medium strength to play safe.After you are done, you will head back to ground floor with a nice tea (think it was Chinese tea) served to you and then just rest a while before you make your move.So when I am next in Bangkok it\u2019s near enough confirmed I will defiantly pop over again."

We were greeted with a cup of hot tea and then briefed through shortly by the owner. She even asked us the preference that we want. (strong/medium/soft) I chose medium and it was a bit too strong for me. The awkward part was when she pulled down your towel and massaged your breast. I didn't like that part. (and yea, it's included in the package) The leg massage was so comfortable that I think I've went into dreamland. I was awaken by the cold mask which was applied on my face. The facial treatment was pretty good too. The therapist applied many layers of liquid/ mask on my face which smells and feel good. I fell asleep once again as it was really comfortable. I bought a bottle of hair shampoo which costs around 250baht if i remember correctly. They also sell other spa products such as lotion, soaps, massage oil. For couples, You can request for 'Room 6'. It is a room with 2 bed, quite spacious. We couldn't get a taxi at that area so we used uber."

I chose the 90-minute \"Signature\" face and body massage -- which was incredible.

Her technique, which apparently incorporates Korean massage principles, translated into pure bliss on my legs, arms and hands.

Very relaxing.\u00a0 Great experience.\u00a0 Will be coming back on my next trip to Bangkok."

I was out walking on a hot day and thought that the road I took would take me through to the next Soi, it did not but it did take me past the location of the Su Esthetic Home Spa. On the way back I decided to visit the spa, it looked very appealing and nice on the outside. Inside was just as nice, large open homely space with very attentive staff, including the owner.I chose a treatment, I am not sure of the name now but it was for a 90 minute oil massage with a Korean influence. It was one of the very best oil massage that I have ever experienced, quite the work out yet relaxing at the same time."

The lotions and oils were wonderful.\u00a0 I highly recommend this affordable luxury. Close enough to BTS at Phrom Phong for an easy walk. But far enough from the craziness of Sukhumvit that while in the spa I could hear the sounds of the birds outside instead of the noise of traffic."

The therapists are well trained and know their job. The massage was perfect. My daughter went for 2&half hours of Korean Spa and loved it. I did a one and half hour face & body treatment with intensive eye treatment. Everything was fine. My only complaint is that the massage felt a bit short. Though the treatment lasted full one and half hours, the actual massage part was much less than what I had in other places. There were times when the masks were drying, which could have been used for massage. Having said that, it was a minor quibble & the entire experience was quite enjoyable for us."

English, Mandarin, Cantonese or Thai, her multilingual abilities should make sure nothing is lost in translation. The decor and warm lighting exudes zen befitting of a renowned spa house.The spa/massage itself was amazing, the quality of treatment you receive worth every dollar spent. Professional masseurs will tend to your every need for a comfortable experience. If the roadside parlours aren't your kind of thing, you'd be glad spending the extra buck for amazing quality and value here. Comfortable for visits alone, with your spouse or even friends, to pamper yourself on holiday."

Let me preface- I've been to a LOT of little massage joints around Bangkok where the ladies sit around and chit chat with one another- and even talk to one another while massaging you... (I realize this type of massage is normal at a certain price point- and if you go up over $50, it rarely happens... but when I'm here, I'm in the business of daily massages- so I'm looking more for the less-than-thirty prices...) Su Esthetic was away from the busy streets (while slightly off the beaten path- they are happy to speak with your cab driver and explain where they are located- or there are good walking instructions on their website)- It was clean- quiet, and adorable. I had a facial and massage, and my friend had a body scrub and facial... They were WONDERFUL, quiet, perfectly gentle and so so relaxing. She asked before beginning how strong I wanted my massage- I also expressed some concern about skin sensitivities- She really listened and both were perfect. The staff were very professional- courteous and quiet- And as it started raining, they scrambled around to try and get us a taxi- even going as far as rushing out to the main street to flag one down... (Although it didn't work out, we TRULY appreciated the effort... ) The place is already affordable, but the promo prices are an extra sweet deal. I will absolutely be back-"

I have had massages before, but this one was my favorite by far and my husband's first full body massage. Upon arrival we were greeted by a front staff member who invited us to remove our shoes (to keep the interior clean), enjoy a cup of tea, and wait on the couches in the lobby area. The establishment itself is very quiet and peaceful. It was not hard to find but we had our phones with a map application. It was approximately a 15 minute walk from the closest MTR, but the walk was through a quiet neighborhood. Regardless of the method of arrival, THIS PLACE IS WORTH THE TREK! The interior of the spa is clean--from the waiting area, to the bathroom, and the massage rooms. Everything is immaculate and quiet, thus creating a calming environment perfect for relaxation.We booked a 1 hour couple's massage. Our masseuses were punctual, professional, and very polite. They routinely asked if the pressure level was acceptable and adjusted their firmness as was appropriate. We both enjoyed how balanced and detailed the massage was in that they paid proper attention to individual parts of our bodies, working their way from head to toe methodically and evenly. This massage was a blend of Thai and Korean influences, as they advertise on their website. Be prepared to be bent in (comfortable) ways you have not thought of, but the end result is worth it! At the end of the massage we both felt mellow, relaxed, and I personally wished we booked more time simply because it FELT. SO. GOOD. We paid 1500 baht total with tip included (those ladies were great and earned it!) for both of us for a full hour, which was approximately $46 USD. It was such a good deal, especially when some of the other places we considered were over 2000 baht per person. We highly recommend Su Esthetic and would return here if we ever visit Bangkok again!"

The face and body massage is really a complete top-to-toe pampering including a korean aroma oil massage, facial massage, bust lifting, special tummy massage with herbal hot pack to soothe the tummy and improve blood circulation.

I visited Su Esthetic Home Spa with my parents for a 1 &1/2 hour massage & facial. Upon entering the spa, we were greeted by the ever so sweet spa owner, Monique, and were asked to remove our shoes (slippers & hot tea were provided). We were then escorted upstairs into a beautifully decorated and clean room separated by curtains for a little more privacy. We slipped into a wrap towel and laid face up on the massage table. We are massage enthusiasts and never have we experienced a massage & facial simultaneously. The massage was deep, relaxing, and at times awkward (bust lifting & firming). My built up tension (knots) melted away with the rather interesting yet effective Korean techniques. The facial was equally fabulous as they applied a series of soothing masks & even an ultrasonic cleansing machine that sucked all the impurities & blackheads out of my clogged up skin. Once our services were complete, I went into a room downstairs to apply my makeup and fix my hair. The room was set up with a large mirror, table, bed (if one would like to take a nap) and supplies (cotton balls, qtips, hairspray, etc). Overall, the most wonderful experience one could have at a spa at very affordable prices. Highly recommended!Note: It was a bit tricky finding the location. We took the BTS train to the Phrom Phong station. We wasted 15 minutes trying to find a cab driver that understood english or was able to read our printed map of the location. We ended up walking into a bank to exchange money (the spa only accepts cash) and we asked one of the bank tellers to write in Thai the address of the spa. It was then that we were able to find a cab driver to take us to the spa. I recommend doing the same as well as including the phone number of the spa so the driver can call and ask for directions."

He finally resorted to asking those local motorcyclist guys who were chilling about by the road side in that area."

After researching different spa services offered in Bangkok, I decided to try out Su Esthetic Home Spa because their services offered are unique and different. I made an online booking to obtain a promotional rate.I corresponded with Monique via email who help me select the appropriate treatment. Her responses were prompt and addressed my questions. I selected the Traditional Korean Spa which includes aroma spa bath, full body scrub, and their face and body massage. Upon arriving at the Spa sweaty, I was offered a chilled drink and Monique explained the different type of oil. I was led to a pleasant, clean private room which has the spa tub and two massage beds. The aroma spa was pleasant, refreshing, and relaxing. After the spa, my masseur explained the various procedures that she is going to performed. My masseur started with my face cleaning before doing the massages. Her massages were firm and strong which helps me to loosen up the tight muscles around my shoulders and lower back. The whole process was not rushed, even though I had a plane to catch, and made me feeling very comfortable and relax on my next long-haul flight. When I arrived at my final destination after travelling about ~ 30 hours flight time due to a strike at Frankfurt airport, the body still feels fine!!!Thank you for your treatments, prompt responses and suggestions, and running a professional place which I truly appreciate."

The must of the must is their professional masseuses that take care of you while waiting for the collagen mask to get fully absorbed by your skin.Very good value for your money.Suesthetic is not only a spa it is also a very professional massage parlor, I usually go for the signature facial and my husband just for the professional massages.I love: its quiet location, its very relaxing ambiance and decoration, the real professional masseuses, the good price for the value.Most of others spas that I have tried on Sukhumvit soi 24 and Thonglor are very expensive and they don\u2019t even provide the massage and don\u2019t use the professional facial equipment\u2019s.The owner, a lovely lady from Hong Kong, speaks English, Cantonese, Thai and Japanese!She will always try to accommodate you the way you want.Suesthetic is a must do."

Finding the place can be a challenge, notwithstanding the map they provide, so for the benefit of my traveller friends, I have given the suggestion to the very nice lady who owns the place, the general direction from Sky train station Phrom Phong station which is nearest to it. Walt toward soi 26 if you coming from direction of Siam you walk in the direction train went. turn right in soi 26 sukhumvit walk for 10-15 min depending on your pace. Keep a watch for small lane going to the right turn into that another 100-150 mtr. is where it is located. Take prior appointment recommended."

The receptionist is fluent in english and was kind enough to call us a taxi after our massage, and relay to the drivers our destination, despite it was nearing their closing time and most of the cabs were uninterested in picking us, so it did took quite a bit of effort from them to get us a cab. I do agree that the location is hard to get to. While there was a map provided, the map is not drawn to scale and we underestimated the distance of the spa from phrom phong station. Thus, we did face a little difficulty going there. Do note that the walk from Sukhumvit Road to Soprano House (along Soi 26) is about 10-15 minutes walk. Thereafter, there are clear signage directing to the spa. The whole atmosphere at the spa is truly tranquil and comforting. As mentioned above, the massage provided left my partner and myself very satisfied. All in all, I do recommend everyone to try Su esthetics."

Whatever the issue you are facing ... go and get a session and afterwards you will leave with a felt sense of what it's like to live in possibility."

While I was waiting I noticed a list of charity work that was being done by the team at Omroom which I was impressed by. Healing and Tarot were great, I left feeling recharged and clear minded. Highly recommend for those starting a journey and those who just need some time out and inner peace. Thank you."

Looking at my own life, I could clearly see a pattern of behavior in my adult relationships that stemmed back to my childhood. I telephoned Omroom for advice, and I was initially impressed by the genuine sincerity I experienced. The suggested healing modality for me was Memory Therapy with Mutsumi. My session was Mutsumi was amazing. Without telling her any information, she was able to pinpoint and heal events in my past that were indeed still replaying themselves today in my adult life. Her overall conclusion of my past was unbelievable because it was so accurate. Everything about my experience with Mutsumi was perfect. I cannot recommend her highly enough. My wife and son are clients now also because of my fantastic personal experience. Both have also had similiar experiences. Thank You Mutsumi and Omroom!"

I had a 2 sessions of cranial sacral therapy for a back issue. Mutsumi was able to pinpoint for me what was contributing to the pain and condition. For the first time I felt like someone was able to really touch the truth of the pain and Mutsumi does so in a way that I have never experienced-- I could only describe as true compassion. Mutsumi spoke of grief I was harboring and spoke of someone close to me that I lost. It was a profound experience and release for me, and I'm sure it will continue over the next few days, weeks and so on it has really brought me closer to my true self. I feel this is the beginning of something new and a shedding of the old. I cannot thank Mutsumi enough or recommend her anymore highly. A Bangkok blessing.. Bangkok is a better place because Mutsumi is doing her thing in the city. I look forward to seeing Mutsumi again I've already planned when that will be. Thank you Mutsumi,Tegan."

She accurately pinpointed both physical long and short-term issues that I had, to my amazement, along with some emotional stress and tension issues. She also told me of the connection between my emotional state with my physical state, and how this therapy could help. I was particularly amazed by the fact that she picked up on my physical issues (as these were quite specific and had only been picked up recently by an orthopedic surgeon). I look forward to my next session.Mutsumi's deep knowledge and experience in various therapies, and her ability to mix and match her learnings and therapies for varied needs, is what I find most effective. I'd urge anyone thinking about exploring the mind-body route to better their lives to give Omroom a try."

Once again, I am new to this type of healing practice, therefore I was skeptical at first considering traditional doctors can not find anything wrong. Mutsumi is extremely gentle and walks you through what the experience will be like. I am not quite sure what I experienced, but I was deeply relaxed and learned some information about possible underlying causes to my issue based off Mutsumi's observations from the private session. Long story short - my headache actually feels better and has temporarily disappeared. Coincidence? - I don't know - however I was impressed by the outcome. I know I need to book more sessions to truly learn more and see if this type of therapy is actually helping in the long term. Regardless, this place is definitely a great place to try!

I go to Omroom very often for my yoga classes, and to attend introductory talks on a number of different topics. It's an excellent place to discover new therapies, theories, ideas and healing techniques, and to meet new people. Depending on the time of the year, they offer yoga and meditation classes about 3 times a week, and a lot of their activities are for donation: this is definitely a laudable idea in a city where yoga is often overpriced and commodified -- they make yoga and guided meditation accessible to everyone, which is brilliant :) I am currently a regular at the Thursday yin yoga classes with Chiharu and at the Monday Dru ones with Britta. I love both teaching styles -- I am also learning about aspects of yoga that are not asana, which is just what I like. These types of yoga are quite restorative and meditative, as opposed to the types of yoga one finds more often in Bangkok, which focus more on asana, physical activity and less on meditation and breathing techniques. Omroom also offer a variety of treatment types by appointment, with several reputed therapists, energy workers, and healers. I only tried this service once so far (craniosacral therapy) and that was also a good experience.Everything is clean, and the therapy and yoga rooms are quiet and welcoming :)  I am so glad I found this space in Bangkok, it helps me slow down the pace of my life in the city, keep a healthy routine and gives me the opportunity to meet like-minded people.

My understanding of Reiki was that it focused on the flow of energy, while what I wanted was more mental therapy as I was feeling stressed from work. Roshni proved me wrong. While she did work on my energy flow, she also spent the entire time explaining to me how my childhood memories had affected my mental state and consequently resulting in the physical issues I had. It felt amazingly rejuvenating and my mother, who I saw after the trip, commented that my facial expression has softened and I seemed much happier.I highly recommend Roshni's reiki session to anyone in Bangkok.

The venue was also very clean and serene, a stark contrast from the bustling Bangkok city centre right outside. I was placed in a soothing environment, lying down, and Mutsumi and I had a brief chat about my background. She then initiated a diagnosis and rather quickly identified the issue that had been troubling me recently. Afterwards, she proceeded to put me in a relaxed state before treating my knee problem (a persistent dull pain).After the session, I immediately felt lighter. I also noted that for the next seven days during the meditation retreat, my knee gave me no trouble at all, despite the fact that I was climbing stairs up and down a mountain.Seeing the benefits, I went back to omroom twice when I returned to Bangkok. Mutsumi was so kind to use the swimming pool in her house for the treatment, to better stretch my legs.Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who has chronic pain but failed to obtain satisfactory answers from western medicine. The result may just surprise you."

I felt more relaxed, calm and grounded, plus I also noticed that I can think slightly clearer. I really do recommend it if you are having troubles with your health/well being or ever have a chance to try it."

There was no message like some of the haters have commented nor was it a waste of money, in fact the price was very reasonable indeed. I went and received healing from a wonderful caring lady by the name of Mitumi, who gave me her precious 2 hrs to heal me with light and energy. I further went to have dinner with her to get to know her more and understand her as a individual and what is their concept at omroom. Basically, my sub conscious mind was tapped upon and region in the body where there is a block in energy needs to be released and sometimes bec of much turmoil in a individual life one can harbour a lot of energy that is unhealthy that can affect one physically as well. This is no one stop solution miracle center and if you are expecting that you need to get your expectation set straight. What I can tell as a customer is that If you do have some emotional affairs that you wish to seek love and light for than omroom is the place was energy, friendship, love and light."

First treatment, I felt lighter. Second treatment I felt more confident and certain of what to do in my life. Mutsumi was patient, diligent and attentive to my situation. She provided a very personalised service that made me felt safe, secure and unafraid. Her energy was calming and reassuring. I would definitely recommend Omroom to anyone who wants to find out more about the Universe, human energy or seek answers from a spiritual sense. Looking forward to my next session! :)"

It was by far the best calming and educational course I have done. Coming from an engineering and science background, I often doubt phenomenon that are unexplainable by science. This course is great in that sense, since Mutsumi use videos and other materials to explain the science behind these phenomenons. Small group sizes and very calming environment at Omroom encourages you to ask questions and learn more. All in all I wish if Sydney had a place like Omroom so I can go regularly. I would highly recommend anyone to go check out Omroom. You can look at their website for the courses and services they offer. Can\u2019t wait to go back to Omroom and learn more."

At the session, Mutsumi suggested CranioSacral Therapy instead as my back and ankles were hurting.During the session, she cleared the blockages at my knees and worked on clearing/shifting around energies in my body. The effect was immediate. I cannot explain it but it worked wonders - for the next 9 days I was in Bangkok, my ankles did not hurt anymore and I was doing a lot of walking around. I returned for a follow session a week later where she worked on clearing my energies from the inside. I felt much lighter after the sessions and I was pleasantly surprised Mutsumi was able to tell me what were the underlying root causes of the problems I was having, both physical and mentally. She was spot on in stating my bad diet habits and recommended specific changes to my diet. She also taught me some exercises to open up and alleviate some of the injustices (perceived or otherwise) I was feeling. I had not shared this with her but she was able to tell.I make regular trips to Bangkok and always get massages done but this is the best investment I have done - beats all the massages and spas. It will definitely be on top of my to-do list of activities whenever I go Bangkok. Will try Memory Therapy next round.Getting to the place was a breeze. It is directly behind the Central Chidlom mall at BTS Chidlom. You should make an appointment ahead and not walk in."

Both my husband and I have been amazed at her confident, gentle approach and are already planning another visit to Bangkok just to see what other therapy we can do.

I booked a last minute session with Mutsumi Adachi and arrived not knowing what treatment i wanted. After some discussion, she suggested Memory Therapy, followed by chakra balancing with Eri T.It is hard to describe the session and i can only quantify the result physically. I wanted to find a solution to my sleeping problem that i had been having for months. Not only did i get just that but also my neck pain was gone immediately after the session. Mutsumi highlighted some events in my life that may have been the cause of my physical or emotional pains and understanding that made me see certain aspects of my life differently. Big thanks to Eri T as well for the reiki chakra healing and explanation and reassurance. As for the high price (for my budget), i consider money well spent for my own personal well being (even after 2 massages, my neck was still sore). I only regret not having discovered the Omroom sooner. I will definitely come back next time i am in bkk. I feel very lucky to have discover and experience this healing session, in a litteral sense."

It is an amazing process in which your body tells you, via the practitioner what it was that caused the issue and then provides a way to deal with that energy and release it. The session is very private in one of their 3 comfortable treatment rooms and uses muscle testing and questions to identify an issue (which may seem insignificant now but had a serious effect on your belief systems and energies when the event occurred). Once identified the energy can be released using a variety of methods so that healing can begin. All you need to attend is an openness and the desire to heal and let Mutsumi do the rest. Omroom also has yoga, Reiki, Chi-Gong, Tarot and other events which can be seen on their website. I will certainly be going again to finally address these frustrating health issues."

            "review": "Memory therapy & hypnotherapy are incredible. I had been searching for a place to do yoga and and came across the Omroom. Mutsumi, one of the partners, welcomed me like I was an old friend. She's not only kind but she is also humble, knowledgeable, honest and passionate about offering and teaching healing to others. These qualities and Omroom have drawn me in. I've had the Mindscape or Memory Therapy and for lack of a better word, it's been incredible. I also attended the by-donation Hypnotherapy session with Marleen and booked a session with her afterwards. I've only ever witnessed hypnotherapy in a comedic sense but knowing how the mind and body CAN work together if we are open to it, is beyond anything I could have imagined. I wanted to work on self-confidence. The result didn't hit me until I point blank asked my boss to hire me for a newly created position that I wanted and he did. Prior to the session, I never would have been so bold. That was 2 months ago and my professional success has moved rapidly upward in ways I never would have imagined. People around me have noticed the change in my confidence and I know it was because of that session. I've since had 2 more sessions to work on weight loss and the changes (although it's taking time) have been staggering. Whatever you go to Omroom for, know that the healers want the best for you and as long as you're open to success, you'll receive it."

I came across Omroom while searching for meditation training in Bangkok and found that it offered an array of classes and therapies in the area of self-awareness. I was intrigued to try something called Memory Therapy. As I understand it, this process helps to release long-standing embedded traumas from within the subconscious. The practitioner, Mutsumi, while being very comforting, was able to quickly hone in on several deep-seated issues and bring them to the surface. I found this to be an illuminating experience and felt a lightening of some deep emotional burdens. I was also fortunate to have met Marleen for an excellent hypnotherapy session, which was both soothing and empowering. I'm happy to have found Omroom and consider it a unique, restorative spiritual retreat within the urban jungle of Bangkok. I highly recommend it."

After spending time with a number of Omroom\u2019s consultants, I am totally in support of healing. It works. I don\u2019t understand why, but it works. In my view, Omroom is one of the high calibre healing establishments that is contributing to a mindshift in support of healing and wellness across the world. They are totally professional, compassionate, and have a range of capable local and visiting international healers across diverse modalities. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate in recommending Omroom."

WoW!! this turned out to be quite a miracle indeed. the Memory Therapy allowed my own body to tell me the exact time, person, place (and more) that cause these blockages (in my lower back and spleen!!). Matsumi not only released these blockages, but also recharged my CHI!!! after the treatment, she kindly offered me refreshing mint tea and some fresh fruits as well!! This amazing experience was much more than I'd imagined. Thank you Matsumi!!"

I went to Omroom seeking any form of healing as I was going through a lot of personal problems at that time and everything I had tried wasn't working. I am not a big believer of energy healing and such holistic treatments, but I was at my wit's end. A friend recommended Omroom to me and when I entered their facility, I already felt much lighter and comfortable. It really is like a little sanctuary in the hustle and bustle of Bangkok. I ended up receiving Memory Therapy treatment from a warm-natured consultant called Mutsumi. She was a very good listener and took in stride my skepticism. She gave me a great insight into my mind and body that I never really knew and it was very interesting to learn where the sources of my negative energy was. After she was done tapping out the harmful energy out of me, I felt amazing. There was a huge difference in how I felt before walking into Omroom and after leaving. Omroom has an impressive range of healing services such as reiki, chi gong, yoga etc and a very nice staff to explain what each thing is. It's definitely worth checking out.. even if you aren't normally interested in those kind of things because, like me, I found something that worked."

You get to select which scrub and oils are used by smelling them. It's more expensive than other massages in Bangkok but you get what you pay for! Totally worth it!"

A venue is very convenient location at Gaysorn Plaza, the center of shopping street in Bangkok. You can go by bts (Chidlom Station) or drive and park here. The atmosphere is very good and perfect for a relaxing time. I really like an organic products here especially a massage oil. When you come to spa, you can choose a scent of oil from 5 aroma. I prefer Geranium and Black Jasmine. A spa room is very stylish, unique and clean.They also have a couple room.

Reflecting on the good stuff, the space and overall ambience is beautiful, and from the moment I walked in, I was well looked after with a cold towel, tea and options for my package. Once we discussed the options, I was ushered to my private suite - it was incredible to say the least and extremely well equipped. My package included a body scrub (60 min), body massage (90 min) and concluded with an Indian head massage (30 min). The body scrub was by far the best part of the overall package - a great product/service, and especially nice to actually shower after the scrub, rather then enduring multiple warm towels to wipe off the product. I chose their most firmest massage but unfortunately it was anything but firm - I suppose I should\u2019ve asked to intensify the delivery, but as someone who gets regular massages, I was also disappointed on the overall technique as there was little focus on muscle tension, it was more so relaxation. The Indian head massage was also disappointing with technique also lacking - it was more head rubbing, rather then a traditional Indian head massage.Taking out the showers I had at the beginning and end of the treatment, the total time was only 2 hours and 15 minutes, which was 45 minutes shorter than the 3 hour treatment I paid for. For almost 4000 THB, I wish that I went back to COMO Shambhala at the Metropolitan hotel."

Then, the staff served me with a cup of iced-cold tea and hand towel, and my irritation from the \u201cheat\u201d was all gone at the moment. After filling out the customer information, the staff explained to me for a Spa procedure and the options from the scents of the massage oils. I chose lemongrass massage oil because I like the refreshing and light scent in the summer. However, I\u2019ve tried the Thai massage on the street yesterday and it didn\u2019t relax my sore muscles at all. Thus, I am looking forward to enjoying Panpuri\u2019s spa service today. The staff guided me into a mysterious spa room and gave me a brief spa procedure.Then, the spa session begins! I thought it was just a regular Thai massage with essential oils. The therapist used the strong force to massage from my feet to the whole body, even the sore parts of my muscles, and of course, the lemongrass smell was very pleasant as well. After 15 minutes, the treatment from the therapist let go of my tiredness and soreness. However, I always needed to rinse off the massage oil after the regular spa sessions. To my surprise, my skin completely absorbed Panpuri organic spa\u2019s essential oil after the session and no need to rinse it off. Spa room was decorated in a luxury, mysterious style with scented candles. Bathroom and toilet are separated in a simple style as well.The Siamese water shower gel and shampoo are full of beautiful jasmine aroma, which brings me a sense of refreshing. I am looking forward to another panpuri organic spa session soon."

These days I have business trip around Bangkok for a week, after I finished busy weekend, I want to relax and do the face treatment. I started searching a right place from a local website then I came across this spa called \"Panpuri Organic Spa\" is very interesting. With the easy to access location in the heart of Bangkok, I walk only 5 minutes from Chidlom Skytrain Station to thse lobby of Gaysorn Plaza Department Store. It's very easy to find.Apart from that, the staffs are very nice. They smile and talk to customers in a good manner. I am really impressed the service here. That day, it was not too busy, so I can look around the shop. The products are awesome as well, they are mainly made from jasmine and organic ingredients which can help anti-aging system, the staff said. I did facial treatment for 75 minutes, I feel very relaxed, comfortable and my face is brighter, skin was softer after doing that with the aroma therapy could make me sleep. The therapists are nice and friendly and they don't push any hard sales on you. There are both facial treatment and whole body available. You may search from its website to reserve and check the promotions. I can tell that it's worth for my money and I was happy. I strongly recommend this Panpuri Organic Spa to Trip Advisor and everyone.Thank you and have a nice day."

If you are here on a trip add it to your itinerary, if you live here and go to the spa often make Panpuri part of your routine. The staff optimizes Thai hospitality, all speak good English, and thoroughly explain all the treatments and will give you a choice of a whole range of different organic massage oils to pick before you begin your massage and let you pick the one best suited to you mood and preference. This is actually one of my favorite parts as they place a small drop on your arm let you smell each oil and then gently wipe it off to show you the next one.I\u2019ve been to the spa multiple times and this time I picked the Samruam Luk Pra Kob Herbal Tranquility Massage which makes use of the traditional Thai Herbal Hot Compress which I had never experienced before. This massage was the perfect way to kick off my weekend on a Friday night after a long week at work. I could feel the stress leaving my body with this massage and I recommend the compress massage to anyone looking to treat themselves. There are lots of places you could chose to go in Bangkok for a massage but Panpuri gets it right with all the little details such as offering you a cold organic beverage and wonderfully scented cold cloth to wipe your face before you begin, to the complementary foot scrub with each treatment, to putting beautiful flowers floating in a bowl so that when you are face down on the massage table when you open your eyes you are not looking at the floor but rather a splash of beauty. Panpuri is my go to place not only for myself but where I take out of town guest to treat them. I can\u2019t wait for my next visit. 5-Stars all the time, every time."

The lady at reception offer me if i need to change or use the towel so i would feel more comfortable.She prepared the herbal lotus drink awhile i wait for the spa. And asked me which flavors of oil i would prefer. They have about 5 different smell as different oil for different purposes like Skin care, relax massage or muscle release.The spa is really good decoration like 5 stars hotel, and they have private shower and restroom in the spa room and make me feel really private.(some place i've been they have 1~2 changing room and the staff will manage the traffic so the guess not come in the same time) She starts to clean my feet with warm water and bargamot lime. And she described how this work for my health. And also warm herbal neck pillow awhile she clean my feet.The process of message is really nice i asked for my shoulder and back spot as i was stress from the gym yesterday and she spent time enough to release the stress on my shoulder and back.For the small girl i found out that she has more strength than me!!!! The massage is not too weak or too heavy and the level is stable for 1 hour (normally i asked for the man to do the massage because i like it hard)Awhile massaged she dim the light to get the perfect spot of relaxation and the music not to loud or too low.After finish she took me to the lobby, and lovely reception again bring me the lotus herbal tea.I'd spent many hour at massage place around bangkok. I would say Panpuri is the one that really like. For the service and atmosphere. I've Really enjoy my 1 hour in this place. \"They changed my bad raining day to the bright and relax and stress away day.\""

I am sorry for not speaking Thai language, but I think to hearing the number is required skill for receptionist at least. Well let me share about good point. The receptionist was helpful and nice. I felt welcomed indeed. I got summer promotion which 3 hours treatment: foot bath, body scrub, herbal ball massage and head massage. Products and atmosphere was great. Heat mat was good to prevent for feeling cold. Tamarind scrub made my body so bright. It would be more better, if the therapist offered me to some drinks during treatment. 3 hours is too long without hydrate.

In the beginning of the treatment we were so in love with the bath ritual, they have many different flavors to chose. make you feel very relaxed and enjoying with next step of the treatment. The therapist was so professional and highly skilled. After treatment we shower and use some panpuri products. The jasmine body wash its my favorite one.

It had a large private shower room attached and I the bed was very slightly heated, which made it feel like slipping into a warm bed.

It means you can either bring a friend and get the second treatment free, or you can choose two treatments for the same person and get the second treatment free. We went for the Maliwan invigorating facial with eye lift treatment each (at 3500 baht) and the signature massages (around 2900-3100 baht each). These prices have yet to include the 7% VAT. The therapists were professional and friendly, and my therapist had a very delicate touch. I found my whole treatment relaxing and she checked in with me from time to time to make sure everything was ok. The oil products are supposedly all organic and it definitely smelled wonderful. The price for two people for a full 3 hour treatment was around 6500+ baht. Very good for a top quality spa! Overall the spa was spotless clean, and the ambience of 4/5 star quality. One of the best spas we have visited in BKK so far, although at full price it's definitely in the expensive range. It is, after all, within Gaysorn - sporting some of the highest end brands. It was a lovely 3 hours well spent. One note - we shopped at the panpuri product shop next door, and found moments later that central world (shopping mall) across the street sold the exact same products for an extra 5% off ... Just know that the adjacent shop may not be the cheapest; but you do get top quality service to try out all the products before you purchase. Another note is that they are one of the larger aromatherapy/skin product companies in BKK, which reminds me a bit of Thann, but panpuri boasts certified organic products; if you're into the authentic independent Thai experience e.g. wooden floors, religious statues and sarongs, this wouldn't be the place - it's more an upscale modern hotel style spa with zen decor and dark, sleek overtones.

Everyone (receptionist, therapists) was so lovely and welcoming that I immediately felt \u201cat home\u201d. Before the ritual starts they took the time to ask me some questions to make sure the treatment would be perfectly suited to my skin type and to my tastes - they take health and well-being very seriously and only use organic products including the towels (!). The ritual itself was amazing and so were the delicate scents of jasmine and rose (only essential oils, I was told), the therapists obviously know what they are doing. I couldn\u2019t believe how soft and comfortable my face was afterwards. Right after the treatment I was offered a delicious herbal tea that left me feeling even more relaxed and comfy. By far the best spa I\u2019ve ever been, a wonderful experience. I would go back every week if I could\u2026"

Being a novice toThai massages (I usually get Swedish massages), I underestimated the strength of the petite Thai therapists - they are strong. The medium pressure was a bit much for me at certain points but boy do I feel great after the massage. All the knots were massaged away and I felt like a warm puddle of water - no bones.

I should also add that the spa itself is wonderful- it has a luxury feel and feels very upscale. The treatment itself- oh wow! There were a number of stages using a variety of products- from gentle exfoliating, herbal presses, soothing cream and a glorious floral toner. In addition to all this there was a gentle body massage whilst the face mask was applied. It is difficult to think of what was missing or how I would change this treatment. The Panpuri products are wonderful- high quality, sensual and very good for my skin. The treatment ended with a fresh cup of tea and papaya and I am sure I will be attending again.

I won\u2019t bother travelling to one even though the price is usually more reasonable or the place accessible. However, the divine experiences I got from Panpuri Gaysorn Bangkok have changed me. One afternoon I was wandering in the shopping mall for nothing. And I walked pass the Panpuri shop. Out of curiosity, I browsed their price list at the front door. Soon a man came out and greeted me. He introduced me the different treatments offered by the SPA. And he said that there would be a 15% discount for treatments after 1930. At that time I was not sure about my itinerary and so didn\u2019t make any appointments. After a while I was bored at my hotel room and so I called the shop. Luckily there is a room for the treatment and so I rushed there. The price for a full-body treatment was about 2200 bahts. After discussing with the beautifician, they recommended another treatment which was cheaper. I then made the payment. Not long after the man who greeted me earlier discovered that they didn\u2019t offer me the discount. He informed me about it and I got my money back. This was a very noble thing he did. Honesty goes a long way. And soon I was directed to the SPA room, which was comfortable and spacious. The messeuse did a great job. The oils they used smelt great. For your info, there are Rose, Lemongrass, Vetiver, Jasmine and one more (I forgot) oils to choose from. They claim that their products are natural. I am no expert in the field so I can\u2019t make any comments. The experience was impressive. Everybody was nice and professional. I went to my hotel feeling relaxed and blissful. And the next day I couldn\u2019t help making another appointment there and enjoyed my last night in Bangkok. Time was so precious and I chose to spend my evening there again. And next time when I visit the city, I will definitely go there again. And I recommend this SPA to everyone who loves aromatic massages.I love Panpuri and I love Thailand."

            "review": "Best Spa in Bangkok Hands Down. I recently visited the Panpuri Organic Spa in Bangkok and I can say hands down it was the best spa visit I have ever had. I am an expat in Bangkok and have visited multiple spas and Panpuri by far blows them all out of the water. Tong was the front desk clerk, he greeted me and immediately brought me a delicious cold flower drink. I signed up to get the Prana Stress Relieving Massage and a Maliwan Invigorating Facial with Eye LIft Treatment and Tong thoroughly explained all the treatments. I have a bad back and he helped me select the correct massage that would be most beneficial to relief some tension.From there I entered the treatment room which was in itself a reason to go to the spa. The interiors are beautiful and are a must see with lit candles in the rooms. I felt like I was in a scene from a movie; it was gorgeous. My spa therapist was Maew and she was great and is truly a professional. She checked in with me multiple times to make sure the pressure that she was applying was appropriate and to my liking. Also the facial was amazing, I fell asleep for a brief moment I was so relaxed. The foot scrub was also really relaxing and the perfect way to start the treatment. Even the golden bowl that my feet were placed in to soak was beautiful and I felt right at home and totally relaxed even before my massage began. The only regret I have about this experience is that I didn't book myself in for a longer appointment and I was there for over two hours, I didn't want to leave! Finally when I was done I was served more relaxing tea and brought organic dragon fruit which I had no idea was so incredibly delicious. I can't really put into words how great and unique this spa is, you really have to see it for yourself, it is unlike any other spa I have ever been to and is my new favorite. The staff were wonderful, totally sweet and kind with absolutely no pretentiousness, they were just great. If you really want to treat yourself and experience a Thai spa that is hands down the best of the best this is the one you want to visit. I went in on a Friday morning and left feeling great and felt relaxed and wonderful the entire weekend. Thank you Panpuri, I will be back, count me in as a regular client."

Providing that this spa is locating in the middle of the city, I can find an absolute sanctuary being here. The treatment started with steam, foot bath/scrub, body scrub (the scrub itself is not painful; the feel after is sillky), bath, and of course, oil massage! It has to be said here that the therapist is very well trained. The massage is super relaxing. I fell asleep half-way after and woke up once it's over. Absolutely a recommend."

Living in Thailand as an expat for the past 10 years I was fortunate to experience Thai culture and spas. PANPURI completely is a different experience than what you would get even at the. Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons in the US. Located in the beautiful upscale Gaysorn Plaza PANPURI Organic Spa truly bar none. Purpose for my first time visit was to take my Korean mom visiting from California who has never experienced a spa in her whole humble life. I wanted only the best and leave a lasting experience to remember for our mother daughter bonding time.The lobby and staff are professional and consult your problem areas and take their time asking questions and also offer and educate you on the high quality essencial massage oils. Each room has a private room. They start you off with Rose water foot bath in dim lighting with aroma oils and meditating soothing music (not the annoying kind you are forced to listen at other spas). This is probably my 20th time at a spa massage experience in my entire life and for the first time PANPURI really puts you in another euphoric mind set and body. At the end the offer you wonderful tea and light snack. When it was time to leave my mom would not get off the lounge area. She was in shock of the wonderful experience she just encountered. I would highly recommend this for any local or tourist who wants an out of body experience to relieve stress, relaxing, and soothing mind and soul."

The moment that I walked-in, all staffs gave a very warm welcome by Wai greeting which I was really impressive, and served me with welcome drink which could refresh myself from my tiring day. I chose aromatherapy& massage with signature oil (jasmin oil) for my relaxation, The therapist is very well-trained who could provide excellent massage skill, very humble, polite and very attentive for all the details that I was really relaxed, calm and comfortable also I could feel my back pain condition has been relieved incredibly . Another point that I really love this spa is all products that being used for customer, are made from natural organic stuff even towel.....In terms of the price...is very reasonable compare to the excellent services and luxurious products provided. At last I would definitely come over again and this spa is very recommended to all those need a true relaxation."

Their receptionist are also very friendly and polite who give full consultation, explanation of the products they use for my massage.

We didn't call until the morning of to make a reservation, and they were already pretty booked. I'd recommend making reservations ahead to make sure you can get the time slots you want. We chose scrub and aromatherapy oil to use before being guided into the treatment rooms. My mom did not speak any Thai or English, but she seemed to get through the services fine. They provided tea before the service and tea and sliced mango after the service, which was very nice. I've had better massages but prices were very reasonable for what they provided. Great value."

Marco had been excellent to make sure we were served well.I had a couple spa room and it was beautifully decorated. Although there was a little bit of traffic noise (it was on a weekend thus the road was clear and the motorbikes tend to ramp up a little more speed), this was felt only at the beginning and it wasn't that bothersome. The masseurs were very professional (never chatted) and the massages were really good!

Marco welcomed us with tea, but also expressed his inability to accommodate us as all the rooms were fully booked. Since we had walked a fair bit to reach the Spa, we asked if we could wait in the hope that some of the guests would not show up so we could get the massages. Marco was fine with this, so we chatted with him while he managed the guests, his therapists and phone calls.As luck would have it, two guests did not turn up, so we were able to get our therapies done. We chose the 90-minutes Deep Tissue Massages. The therapy rooms very clean, though there was some noise coming from outside. The therapists were professional and polite. I slept through most of my massage, which is always a good sign (at least for me) because it shows I was relaxed during the treatment. Later, Marco spoke with me (since he had left the Spa) and enquired about our experience. I thought that was rather nice of him.To summarise, I highly recommend Bann Sabai Spa and hope to visit again the next time I'm in Bangkok. Of course, I will make a reservation this time as I cannot hope to be lucky twice."

The room is designed for one person only so it's very small. The air con was facing right to the massage bed, so I was freezing cold during my massage. We started at 7:30pm but finished at 9:10pm. It's fine as I don't want to stay any longer. I went there because of the rating on TA but I guess The spa was overrated."

On our latest trip we discovered Baan Sabai Spa and now, without a doubt, it is our new favorite. We called ahead and made a booking for a couples massage. Marco greeted us at the door and gave us a brief, informative orientation and took our specific requests. Our masseuses were well-trained and knowledgeable. The spa is very clean and beautifully decorated with lovely Thai art. I got the two hour oil massage and herbal compress. My wife chose the two hour coconut oil message and facial. Both of us were extremely pleased! Our only regret was that we discovered this sensual oasis near the end of our trip so we'll now have to wait until our next visit to Bangkok to return. We highly recommend Baan Sabai Spa for anyone looking a truly wonderful message experience."

I am not used to give an \"excellent\" rating, but here I could not do differently !To say that I enjoyed the session booked at the Baan Sabai is to say little about the fantastic hours spent with a wonderful masseuse who managed to put me back into shape, touching muscles I did not even know I had and giving me the opportunity also to be alone with my own thoughts in a very relaxing environment. I booked a body scrub, a facial and a massage, all were wonderful and regenerating. The room was quiet, the oils and essences of quality, but above all the, at time steely fingers, at time the soft touches, of the masseuse, made me forget the outside world and transported me on my own cloud were I had time to be with myself. A wonderful experience that I would certainly repeat when in Bangkok and would recommend undeservedly."

The masseur was good as she knew which were my sore areas without me saying anything. She kept trying to break the knots at the neck and limbs region. After the massage, I felt less tensed and muscles lighter. It was a good massage and I would visit them again. Only drawback is the distance from the BTS."

Best to identify with host where you have pains or want to have more attention given. All throughout everyone was polite and friendly. Simple decor that's very inviting.The massage was very good as they were professional and done with controlled strength. Not the painful kind. After the relaxing 2hrs you get a warm tea and mango! And it was super super sweet and tasty. Overall enjoyable experience. Stayed in Doubletree which was near to Baan Sabai and Emporium Mall. Lovely location."

My wife and I are on holiday in Bangkok and have loved our trip. With so much to see and do in Bangkok, its very hot and tiring so we tried out a few massage parlors for some pampering ...Unfortunately the first massage we tried was in the Nana area and it was a nice looking place on the outside but the experience was not a peaceful and tranquil one! It was staff talking to each other and mobile phones going, so we tried another 2 but again was let down by the service.We decided to look online and we found Baan Sabai Spa and the reviews were great so we called up and booked a 2 hour session each. When going there we just stopped a taxi in the street and said Baan Sabai to the driver who ended up taking us to 2 other massage parlous that were not the real Baan Sabai Spa as the first 1 was just full of young girls and very dirty looking. I was lucky to have my phone on me with the internet or I am sure the wife and I would have ended up in the wrong Spa and again left feeling let down.Anyway we arrived at the real Baan Sabi Spa and it has a lovely little garden outside...We walked in and straight away was greeted by smiling ladies and a guy called Marco whom was extremely friendly and polite. We were shown our way to our treatment room by the masseuses and the touch of Heaven we had been searching for we finally found! The massage and service was outstanding! We both loved it, so much in fact that we have already been back another 2 times to try out some other treatments and loved them. The owner Marco has got to know us well and is always a great help when selecting the right massage.So overall Baan Sabai Spa is a little touch of Heaven on Earth and once found you will want to stay! Be sure to find the right Baan Sabi Spa it is on soi 26 and is on the corner because as we found out there are other massage parlors around in the same area but they are just imitations and look like they offer more the \"happy ending\" massages.Thanks again to the staff at Baan Sabai Spa...We will be seeing you again very soon I am sure."

After we had our tea they washed our feet which was so nice because it was hot and dusty outside. Then we went to the massage rooms and put on clean shirt and trousers they provided. The beds were very comfortable. The masseuses were very nice and good at their job, but it was much harder pressure than I'm used to. They kneaded and stretched me for an hour, and I asked twice for lighter pressure- which was a no go. I think that this must be how Thai massages are supposed to feel? Very similar to deep tissue massage. Although it was not very pleasant during the massage, I felt loose and stretched after which was nice- and I think the purpose. We were offered hot tea and fresh mango after the massage which was very nice. Extremely nice spa- just a warning If you don't like very hard massages."

She also put a cushion under my knee without me asking when I turned over and she saw I was not comfortable. The room was restful and quiet.

My hubby and I decided to book massages here after the great reviews on TA and the close proximity to our stay at the Marriott Executive Apartments. What a treat!We were greeted at the door with cold towels and a cool drink. Marco, the owner, could not have been more gracious. I decided on a 90 minute aromatherapy massage and my partner opted for the 90 minute Thai massage.The massage rooms are private and clean. I took a shower to wash off a day of Bangkok dust before the massage therapist began. My therapist was extremely professional and very talented. She made sure to ask if I was comfortable and to apply the right amount of pressure for me. It was extremely relaxing and a terrific experience.My partner said that it was one of the best massages he ever had, and he goes regularly and has a weekly package with the Massage Envy chain when we are home in Washington, DC. After the massage, we were served hot tea and fresh mango. Marco was truly concerned that we were satisfied with our experience. We enjoyed the massages so much, we booked again for our last full day in Bangkok. The experience was just as nice the second time.The price was very reasonable (1100 baht plus 100 baht tip) for the treatment. If this place was near my home, I would go every week! Just terrific!"

The manager was really prompt in replying my emailed and scheduled an appointment for us in the afternoon and made suggestions on the treatment for the visit.We have not visited the spa before so we asked for directions frm the manager frm Emporioum mall which is about 15 min walk.The spa is located almost at the end of soi 26 and is just next to The Four Finger hotel. Along the walk you will pass by a lot of hotels and japanese restaurant. Also a lot of foreigners, expat or tourist walking by.Our apointment is at 3pm. We reach there around 2.30pm and was brought to our room to change and prep for the massage. There were some 30 min delay for them to attend to us. The therapist and manager came to apologize and explain.The spa was ok i did mention a few time for stronger massage. She took a few time to get use to it. We had the virgin coconut oil massage.I think their schedule is quite pack so she might be exhausted. As she is not that consistant during the ssession. We had a couple room the ambience was cozy and peaceful and compliment to them both as they did not talk during the session. Great job!Overall after the treatment the manager once again apologies for the delay. We were not able to use the credit card machine as line was down that day.Hope they resolve the problem as most ppl would rather pay card.Thanks again with the good hospitality and experience."

The owner tried his best to accommodate any last minute changes when we were there. To avoid waiting, it's best to specify the package you intend to experience. The therapists were extremely professional, with just the right amount of pressure for our Thai massages."

People go to a spa, for various reasons.Some go to relax, others to try it for 1st time, then, there are those who look for something else-no reason to describe that here and of course there are all those , who want to enjoy a really good massage,in a proper spa bed or table and in a nice and relaxing ambiance. So environment,decoration, politeness are important factors, but most important thing, is the therapist. Baan Sabai Spa covers successfully all factors and as well , the most important thing, the quality of therapists. I went there 2 times together with my beloved one . First time , was immediately after her arrival in Bangkok, without even checking in the hotel we were going to stay.It was a fantastic experience from the beginning to the end. We've chosen different package, from promotional list and you know how important is to start your vacations without problems and fully satisfied. That, become a reality with our fantastic experience in Baan Sabai Spa. We've been welcomed and taken care as it must happen in a spa. They explained to us what comes next and we had the opportunity to choose aroma , for aromatherapy and type of of oil for oil massage. Then and after cold tea and refreshing towels - suits perfectly after experiencing the heatwave and humid conditions of Bangkok, coming together with the traffic jams to reach anyplace within the city- we were driven to spacious seperate rooms, for our treatments.I had aromatherapy massage compined with hot compress and she had oil massage and body scrub.Both were extremely rejuvenating and that was something discused between us, because we've visited a lot of high end spas arround the globe, as well as rather inexpensive ones.We are not impressed by candles, aroma sticks, music or beauty of therapists and decoration, but only by their quality and ability as therapists.I'm quite experienced on the subject for 3 reasons. One is that i suffer from rheumatoid arthritis , second i worked for a high end spa, in Athens , Greece, as a Media Counsellor and the last one is , that for 30 years i have massage of various type arround the globe.My therapist, Ms Mali, is the best i ever had and i suggest her 100%, as i suggest to you to try Baan Sabai Spa if ever in Bangkok.Owner Marco, a guy from Italy was very friendly, polite and helpful.For all above reasons we paid a second visit next day.I must mention as well, that you could see the happy and relaxed faces of others as they were coming out of their rooms after treatment"

We had the herbal compress and aromatherapy massage.Pricing was very reasonable. Owner Marco was friendly. Close to Indus so it was nice to have a delicious meal after the spa. My husband said he had the best massage in Thailand. We have been to about 14 spas in Thailand. My masseuse was okay. Poor pressure. I had asked 3 times for increased pressure during the massage. Never had to ask so many times before. She interpreted increased pressure as using her elbows and pounding my back rather than using her palms and fingers. So majority of my treatment is her touching me with oil and very minimal massaging. She wasnt very strong. Like any place some employees are skilled and some arent. Overall though they were friendly and the spa itself is nice and clean."

Our therapist can even tell us which part of our body has problem. The only small things which we like to feedback are increase aroma smell in lobby and room, as it will make guests feel more relax before starting their session, and do provide disposable underwear for hot herbal ball session as well.Hope to visit them again soon."

I booked their signature massage with a Thai Herbal massage and a 30 minute hot stone foot massage.i entered through a peaceful covered patio and garden located in a lovely area of Bangkok. The receptionist greeted me with an herbal cold tea.After being escorted to a treatment room and given disposable undies and cotton spa pajamas I was directed to start with a shower. The spa is a year old and all the fixtures are state of the art including the stone shower. The treatment was relaxing and the Thai herbal massage was a new experience, soft and relaxing. Unfortunately the room was needed for the sauna and half way between I was moved to a room with the massage mat on the floor. The move broke up the serenity but was quickly restored. The hot stone foot massage was more like a calf massage. Although it felt nice it wasn't a foot massage. I had expected something like reflexology but it didn't come close. I felt it was a waste..When finished I was given another cup of tea and sliced mango then a taxi was called for me to avoid the haste. This would have been a 5 star experience if I wasn't moved and I had a true foot massage."

The massages were faultless, and the value very good - much cheaper than what you would be paying for at a hotel. Marco the owner was very nice, and the therapists very attentive. The beds were very comfortable and the oils used lovely. The pricing was transparent and all taxes and fees were included. There were three things that made our experience fall short of 5 stars. The shower facilities were not the cleanest as it could be (shower mat looked like could use a wash) and felt slightly run down. There were mosquitoes in the room - the dim room made it hard to see them but we still saw quite a few. And to no fault of the spa, it's not too conveniently located. It is decorated in a more traditional Thai style (wood floors and cushioned seating) which we liked. "

            "review": "Best Massage Experience in Thailand . Found this via the really good reviews from Tripadvisor and I couldn't agree more.It is located at the quiet Japanese residence area and assessable with BTS (direction as below)Direction from the website: From Prom Pong BTS station (exit 4) walk to soi 26.Enter in soi 26 and walk straight for about 800 mt. until 7 eleven and Four Wings hotel.From here just walk 20 more mt.on the side of Four Wings hotel and you will see Baan Sabai Spa clearly.Upon arrival I was greeted by the owner, Marco who has been very helpful and informative. I took the 2hours aromatherapy and hot compress full body massage and I simply love every min of it. Chose the sweet dream massage oil which apparently is their signature! (Others include lemon grass and romantic which is really exclusive for Baan Sabai Spa only)The masseur is very respectful of privacy and all smiley. It is a very typical Thai massage kind (if you love the elbow massage aiming at the sore points). Although a lil bit painful but it helps as I have really stiff shoulder and the massage really help to loosen the knots :) I fell asleep during the hot compress massage part, maybe it is the sweet dream essential oil effect ;)Highly recommended if you are looking for a private less crowded and authentic Thai massage! Do book in advanced via their website (with super swift response) to avoid disappointment.Oh ya on the way to the spa there is this Thai local noodle place which looks really yummy (sort of like \"wan tan mee\") and also a lot of Japanese restaurants and cute little concept cafes if you would love to chill after a long day "

Not very accessible as it is right at the end of Soi 26, you can hop onto one of those 10bht motorbikes and ride pillion but I rather walk as I value my life more. After the long walk in, I was quite disappointed with the spa, it looked old and dated outside and inside. The receptionist did not look very welcoming. They started the 90min aromatherapy massage right away, no questions asked about skin allergy or health condition, no cold towel or welcome drink. They also didnt ask if there is a specific area to focus on. Basically no frills. The therapist was good, she attacked all the usual problem areas of back and shoulder. There was a cup of tea provided at the end of the massage which cost 1100bht. While the therapist was good, I prefer a spa with more customer engagement and nice touches like cold towels and at least some questions to show they want to understand their customers better. The old, dated look is also not my thing so I think this will be my first and last visit. There are better spas elsewhere in Bangkok."

I was first impressed when I scrolled through the reviews in Tripadvisor and saw that the owner Marco replied personally to every review received. It was a good start. I wrote in to make a reservation and the reply received was courteous, prompt and helpful. When we arrived at the spa, Marco was aware that my mother had some injuries with her leg and specially assigned his experienced masseuse to assist my mother with her treatment. Every single question that was asked was patiently answered and explained, we were so amazed by the level of patience exhibited. The treatment room was spacious, tranquil and had well controlled lightings. The accompanying music during the treatment was appropriate, it made the entire 3 hour session extremely soothing and relaxing. The thai massage that we had was professional, the masseuses did not chat during the treatment, which was something I was particular about. Well worth treatment at affordable prices, together with Marco's personal touch, this is a gem for massages and spa sessions in Bangkok. We will definitely be back to visit and will readily recommend this spa to anyone."

Owner of Baan Sabai came to pick us up personally from our hotel in the city area and drove us to his spa. He was very friendly and kind! Upon arriving at his spa, it was a sanctuary that was unlike the surrounding area of the spa location. He recommended and explained each treatment patiently to us and advised us which treatment to get. We were all very impressed by his knowledge of this trade. We chose our respective treatments and proceeded to the rooms. I chose the aroma massage and scrub package. My masseuse was very very skillful. From the start to the end of the 2 hrs long treatment, it was very comfortable and just the right strength and I fell asleep during the massage which I had never done before during massages. After the whole treatment, me and hubby enjoyed the hydrotherapy spa which was highly enjoyable too. We were all so relaxed after the whole session and really wished to come back the next day again. The whole experience at Baan sabai was so lovely and relaxing. No hassle and no fuss. You get more than what you pay for. That's the only thing I can say. Its prices are very reasonable for its standard and definitely something you won't regret. Do not think any further, this is the ONLY spa you have to visit in Bangkok. No regrets, only memories."

It is a fair distance from the prompong BTS station situated next to Four Wings hotel. When we arrived, we were told that they only accept cash as the boss is not present.We booked the 2 hour aromatherapy massage. Usually when you enter the treatment room of a spa, you already start to relax with the scented candles and the soft spa music. There was none of that here. It was only during the last half hour of our massage did the spa music suddenly blasted through. Must have coincided with the owner arriving. So the preceding hour and a half was spent listening to the constant noise of traffic from the road outside and the occassional conversation between the therapists and the telephone ringing away at the reception desk. Hardly soothing nor relaxing. In the shower stall, the soap dispenser was totally empty and no one had bothered to check or refill it, so we ended up washing ourselves with the pink shampoo. The girls were good at what they did, but unfortunately the other negative aspects of this place means I cannot agree with the other reviewers and give it an excellent review. The owner had arrived by the time we finished and he informed us that it was perfectly alright to pay by credit card. I guess my expectations are a little high as this is the first time I have ever ventured out of the hotel spa environment. So perhaps if you are planning to go to this spa, it is advisable to check if the Italian owner is going to be present before you visit."

Based on the prices through their website, it really seemed affordable.When we first got in the door, the guy who met us (Marco) welcomed us in a very polite and humble manner. We got the menu, and were given advice on which massage to take, and how to combine the Thai massage with some neck and shoulder massage at the end. We decided on the 2 hour treatment, which would cost us only 700 baht per person! We were offered the ability to add some oils to the massage, but decided not to - with no bad feelings.This place really lived up to my expectations! We had to leave our shoes on the outside, and were borrowed a cozy pair of slippers. The waiting room, the hallway, the massage room and the restrooms were all perfectly clean. The atmosphere was delightful, with a hint of asian tones from a hidden stereo set. After the masseuses actually washed our feet, we were both handed a pair of neatly washed and cleaned trousers and a shirt that we would wear during the massage - and some privacy to change.Now the full body Thai massage really was something out of the ordinary! Both relaxing and painful in a good way. If you feel stiff, it really hits the right spots. The back massage also takes care of all those hidden and irritating knots. The 2 hours felt to me like 30 minutes! Really enjoyable. My girlfriend also enjoyed her massage very much, but hoped that it was going to be a little stronger. So if you want it a little strong, you better let them know.After the massage we were given a cup of tea, made from some exciting dried fruit. Thankfully there was no sugar added, and it really tasted marvelous. We were even able to buy a bag of these fruits for 70 baht. Worth every baht! When we were leaving, it had started to rain, and we had no umbrella. But Marco got one of the workers to run down the street to get us a taxi. Really fantastic service.If i am ever in Bangkok again, I am coming back there. This is the right place to go!"

He wanted to give us the couple room out the back of the property however he was aware there were construction work going on. Thus he gave us a choice of 2 single rooms as well as the couples room. We didn't had a problem with either choice but decided in the end to go with the couples room. Initially there were some construction noise but at best it only went for 30 minutes. And this was after being notified several times by Marco there might be noise so it wasn't a problem for us. We had the 2 hours Thai Massage. The massage itself was wonderful. Apparently according to the Mrs, I dozed off for a bit during the massage haha . . so that was how affective the massage was to relaxing me. The Mrs also enjoyed hers.After the massage, Marco invited us to have some warm tea as well as some durian chips. Both were delightful.

I had a body scrub and thai massage with oil; my husband had a body scrub and aromatherapy massage. The ladies were highly skilled, polite and professional. The owner was very friendly and accommodating. We really felt like important 'guests', rather than just another customer. Once we had finished our fantastic massages, the owner even kindly offered us both an additional snack and a cup of herbal tea. I highly recommend anyone looking for a massage in Bangkok to visit this superb spa."

We had a feeling that all the big players would be fully booked (on a Sunday) so we searched and decided try Baan Sabai, just by our gut feeling. My wife called and was attended by the owner, Marco himself. He immediately reserved for us his couple room (with x2 massage bed, jaccuzzi and shower) and had everything prepared for us within an hour. When we reached his spa, we were warmly greeted by him and his staff. He then went on to share his couple packages, but wasen't pushy and was even willing to customise the packages for us. We finally decided on 2.5 hrs package. Overall, it was an excellent experience as his staff were very experienced and professional.At the end of the session, we had light chat with Marco and even recommended us some dining options (as it was already dinner time) nearby! We were truly touched by his customer-oriented spirit. Will definitely visit again."

He did some customization to have therapist spent time on my neck/shoulder. Therapist was experienced and gave a really good strong massage. Cracked some \"bones\"...and price is reasonable, felt really relax and rejuvenate...place is also nicely decorated with greens and very clean...Going back to try thai herbal oil massage with herbal compress..Definitely will recommend this place to my friends..."

This newly established spa is conveniently located on the quiet end of Sukhumvit Soi 26, not too far from the main Sukhumvit road and its about a 15 min walk from Phrom Phong BTS station, its also very close if you're coming in from Rama 4 side. Its a beautifully decorated spa, converted from an old house into a little oasis of serenity, you can really see that some thought has gone into the design and feel of the place. I was greeted personally by the owners, which i thought was a very nice touch, they even took the time to recommend a suitable massage package which was perfect for me and my pocket. The staff are super friendly and are very professional at their job, you can see that they only employ the best therapists.The rooms are very clean and are designed for comfort and relaxation, just the way it should be. For the locals, its also good to know that there is parking available on site. If you are looking for a top notch massage at affordable pricing, then you definitely need to visit Baan Sabai...you won't be disappointed."

OnsenThe women's side has both outdoor (2 hot tubs, 1 pool) and indoor (soda pool, onsen pool, jacuzzi pool and cool pool) baths at varying degrees, plus a sauna. Disposable underwear is provided for those who are shy. I have noticed that most wear them. It was not very crowded (<10) when I went on a weekday afternoon. CafeLimited menu but reasonably priced and delicious food. The milk (banana pudding and melon) tasted so good. Bill is charged to the wrist band assigned to you at checkin, hence no need to bring wallet. Bill is settled at checkout when the wrist band is returned at counter. Rest AreaThere is an aircon rest area with TV (silent mode) and around 10 lounges. Blanket provided. Outdoor lounges are available but quite warm in the afternoon. Tuk-TukFree tuk-tuk from Yunomori to Phrom Phong BTS at 30min interval. Check with counter on timings.Overall, I like it as it looks new, is clean and is a close resemblance to Japanese public onsens. You may wish to bring mosquito repellent if you are susceptible to insect bites (I was bitten twice in public areas)."

We took package 2 onsen+one hour Thai massage.Upon arriving, we were greeted by friendly staff though the reception area can be busy at times. The whole process were well thought off:Check in-pay for the services you book-collect flip flops-go to locker room-collect towels, disposable undergarments (women) & yukata (robe)-change and bring small towel only to spa area-shower-use the 5 baths and steam room-shower-wear yukata-go to lobby for massage.Come at least one and half hours before the massage booking time, if you really want experience the bath at your own pace. 10 minutes before your scheduled massage you need to be at the lobby in your yukata. The staff will give you a small form to fill to specify how strong and which part of the body to focus on and to avoid during the massage.Our massages were great. We were given a couple room and we really liked the privacy.After the massage we were given pandan tea, ushered to the lobby where we fill in a feedback form and commit a tip. So the process around the spa is cashless. Upon changing and paying our tips commitment, we were given a check out receipt to collect our shoes before leaving.So the whole process were very systematic and smooth. The spa is quite spacious and there is also a rest area and cafe. We did not try this. But it is quite peaceful despite the crowd.A must go in Thailand if you don't mind being naked/almost naked in a bath. Not for the shy but most relaxing if you dare explore something new."

You can choose onsen only, massage only or a mix. At just 450 Baht (390 Baht if you take a 10 coupon package valid for 1 year) it's a good price. Massage prices are also reasonable. Different types of baths (men and women separated of course) - soda bath, mineral (onsen) bath, steam, sauna, teak bath, jet bath, garden pool, are located in a garden setting adding to the \"mineral spring\" atmosphere. You can enjoy the onsen for as long as you wish, unless you have a massage booked, then they will come and call you. If you wish to enjoy onsen its recommended to go 2 hours before the massage to get full benefit from the onsen because it is not allowed to use onsen after a massage. After using onsen, one can relax in the airconditioned lounge or on the sofa in the garden. To complete the japanese tradition, you can buy milk at the cafe for the after-onsen-milk-drink experience. Yunomori Onsen is indeed a bit of Japan in Bangkok. And when you combine the two (Japan and Thai) most polite cultures of Asia, what more could one expect then the utmost perfection?"

Despite it was stated that no clothes allowed to enter bath area, but almost all still wore the disposable undergarments provided. Perhaps a common practice here. Tried the thai massage as well, it was just passable. Service and ambience was fine but skills wise still can't beat the old school hard core Healthland. For the Jap restaurant adjoining with the Onsen, it was poor and tasted awful, a waste of my time and stomach, could had gone to many better ones nearby. Can forget about it. Will just come for the onsen in future."

Many many thanks.The only bad thing about it is that we will be even more disappointed by average massages in the future."

Everything in the onsen area was the same as what I experienced in Japan. You can spend as much time as you like in the onsen, and you're not allowed to wear anything inside, so just your birthday suit and a tiny 'hand' towel. There are different onsens laid out with different functions and benefits, and then there's the usual dry and wet saunas. I walked out feeling completely renewed. You can also combine this with a massage and spa session after the onsen. Note that you can't use the onsen after a massage for hygeine reasons. The prices are very reasonable and value for money, IMO. Promotion hours (e.g. weekday afternoons) give even greater value. There's a nice Japanese themed garden, faced by a small Japanese cafe if you need to fuel up after a few hours of relaxation.Totally recommended for all... except those who feel shy about waltzing around naked around other naked men."

This is one of the most expensive spas in Bangkok while started from stepping in, we received unaccepted rude and non professional treatment.There's no customer services provided at all, not to mention a 5-star service we expected from what we paid. Nobody told you what to do after you paid and mom and I behaved like an idiot and felt stressed instead of relaxing.The massagers stepped out from 5-15 mins few times during the 3.5 hour treatment and finished 5 mins before the ending time. Their massage technique is also so so. Unless you don't mind to pay a lot for nothing, otherwise think carefully before you gofor myself I definitely won't visit this spa again, There are heaps of cheaper and better spas everywhere in Bangkok, if you want to try onsen in Bangkok, it seems there are some others there as well.when I finished the questionnaire, the receptionist came to ask me why I was so dissatisfied, I told her nothing reached my expectation. I asked her to call a cab for me going back to the hotel and she said she couldn't and could only arrange a free tuk tuk for me. (I learned there are lots of robbing when travelling on tuk tuk in Bangkok!)this is the first and only time I felt totally stressed after a spa treatment, not to mention a quite expensive one. sorry no matter what, I sure won't come back"

I felt really rejuvenated and refreshed after trying out the various onsen tubs - each at various temperatures. There was signage provided at the onsen area to advise guests on which onsen tubs to use first, which proved to be helpful. There was a staff member to guide guests at the locker area. I was initially shy about getting nude in front of everyone else (with just a mini towel) but everyone observed basic onsen etiquette and generally kept to themselves, so I got used to all the nudity in no time. The place was really clean and shower gel, body soap were all provided for the shower. Hairdryers, additional towels, yukata are also provided. I also appreciate the cold water dispenser near the onsen area after spending some time in the hot onsen tub. Service staff at the reception etc were friendly and professional. I didn't try the massage so I cannot comment on that aspect. Location might prove to be a little inconvenient. Not complicated to find but it's a 15-20 min walk along the street from the nearest BTS station. I didn't mind walking. Taking a taxi might be a better option for those who do not want to walk under the scorching sun. Also tried out the cafe. Decent Japanese food at a reasonable price. The place was not crowded when I went on a weekday afternoon."

Can choose your oil scent (rice, jasmine, eucalyp, and one more - I forget). Have had a massage here a couple of times and previous time was just as good. Onsen good as well, though can get busy after work hours (e.g. 7pm to closing). After having read previous comments about this place regarding not being allowed into onsen after oil massage (which makes perfect sense to me), I was taken aback when I was told that use of steam and sauna are also not allowed after oil massage. Now this does not make sense to me - as it's nice for the oil to \"melt\" off your skin in steam/sauna post-massage. And I wouldn't be as annoyed as long as customers were notified beforehand (which I wasn't - and there are NO SIGNS of this anywhere). Receptionists (I'll withhold names) also need to be consistent with their service - providing the same \"high\" standard to BOTH foreigners and locals. Shouting out \"You, You! - and I do not exaggerate when using \"shout\" - to get a customer's attention is not acceptable wherever you are, whoever you are, and whatever nationality you are, even if the supposed customer is \"your friend\"."

Take BTS to Phrom Phong, walk along Sukhumvit 24 till the end of the road (about 15-20 mins walking distance). You will walk pass Marriott Executive apartments. Turn left just before Esso petrol station, and walk right in. In about 150 metres, the spa is on your right hand side, facing an open space carpark. The spa is superbly furnished in authentic Japanese style. The reception area is spacious and inviting. The counter staff were very friendly, and able to explain the packages well in English.We selected the package on Onsen + Aromatherapy + Hot Compress. There are different treatment packages to suit your preference.Separate onsen for the 2 genders, you go on your birthday suit at the Onsen pool area. There is an Onsen Guide that guides you on the correct sequence on pool dipping. There are hot and cold water pools, with a steam room and a dry sauna. After about 45 mins, the attendant will write your locker number on a white board, to inform you ready for massage. You will change to a yukata (Japanese costume) and proceed for your massage. You get to choose which aroma oil you like, and fill in a simple form to indicate which area/s you would like the masseur to pay attention to for your massage. You may choose the massage strength you desire, ranging from soft, medium to firm. I had 1.5 hour body massage, and 30 mins hot compress. The masseur was attentive to details, and very professional. He often asks if I am okay, especially when he was working at those areas where I indicated concern. The hot compress was fantastic, it warmed every inch of my body, which I felt is was revitalising. Not many places offer this spa service, which personally I would highly recommend. After the whole session, we check out at the reception and were given a feedback form to complete. Overall, I am extremely pleased with my visit and I do strongly recommend visiting if you are looking for decent, quality and professional spa service.I paid B1,725 for my package, which I deem reasonable for the service and satisfaction level I received."

For us, one of the reasons for travelling is to experience new things - this is the reason we decided to try the onsen, and way we highly recommend you try it to. The Yunomori Onsen is a really unique place, and though it is not cheap, you get a five star experience. Bathing in the hot pools was very special - it resembles a spa, but is different and has a more ceremonial feeling to it. It's also interesting to do as a couple, as you don't really get to do a lot of things separately in trips abroad, and the separate bathing gives you some time with yourself and a very interesting conversation with your spouse afterwards. After bathing in the onsen we had a couple's massage, and it was excellent. If you do go, here are two important recommendations: First, read online a bit about the onsen (as we said, it's pretty ceremonial, and there are a few things that are good to know before going). One thing you should know is that the onsen is enjoyed in the nude (men bath in the nude, women are offered a set of thin disposable underwear). Second, give yourself a bit more time - we got there an hour before our massage, and with all the process of paying, undressing and washing we only had about half an hour in the onsen before our treatment, when we could have easily enjoyed at least a full hour."

Good selection of aromatherapy and Thai massages plus some discounts for arriving outwith peak periods. Astonishingly, in a place that promotes health and well-being, however, they allow smoking in at least one of their cafes, so points off for that. There is, apparently, a Yunomori tuk-tuk that runs from the Onsen back to the nearest BTS station but, a timetable, if such exists, seems to be a state secret."

Inbetween going into the baths you can get into a yukata and relax in the lie down area and enjoy a cold beer as well as typical Japanese food like cold noodles, curry rice and more. They also offer massage, but when we went it was so full that they had no more slots for the rest of the day. This place was very popular with both the locals and the Japanese living in Bangkok. We left very relaxed!"

Within the onsen you\u2019ll notice paint coming of the walls, broken toilets, wooden benches that are in need of some paint/lacquer, certain items kept together with tape, broken showerheads, etc.Although the massages are nice, the therapy rooms do offer similar problems as the onsen. Again, broken showerheads, walls in need of painting, towels full of threads as well we found the room very noisy with a clear hearing of the people passing by on the corridors.All in all, this good be a nice and attractive option for a Bangkok Spa but unfortunately let down by a very poor state of maintenance. Not recommendable therefore."

I was given a towel, a small towel and a yakata robe. The entrance fee was 450 baht. The locker rooms are stylish and clean. Having removed all my clothes I moved into the onsen area and first showered and soaped before trying out the various facilities.There is a useful instruction board on the wall for beginners like myself. It appears to be the norm to walk around with just the small towel covering your privates. The yakata robe is for use if you wish to leave the onsen area and go to the lobby, cafe or relaxation areas. Next time I visit I will try their aromatherapy massage and body scrub."

The staff was very helpful in instructing me through the whole process and it ended up being a really relaxing experience.

This was my first time at an Onsen (last year I went to Japan but they wouldn't let me into any Onsen as I have tattoos). The whole staff was very kind and helpful, as there are so many new procedures to follow: Where to go (of course there is a seperate area for men and women), how to wear the Yukata (kind of kimono), which of the baths (mineral water, soda, cold, jet, garden) to take first and in what order to use the steam bath and sauna. Of course it all starts with cleaning your body. But there are no showers! Instead you sit down on a small chair and shower sitting down. And its not a private cabin, its all open. Anyway everybody is kind of naked. Inside the bathhouse you are only allowed \"to wear\" a very tiny towel, that you can hold infront of your private parts. After the bath (about 1.5 hours) I took an oli massage which I had to book in advance. That was Ok, but nothing too special. You can find better massages in Bangkok. But the atmosphere and the design are exceptionell. After all that I enjoyed a very nice snack at the cafe and a sublime homemade ginger lemonade. Try to come here early as it might get crowded after 5pm and bring enough time to enjoy."

Even after showering?! I like to go relax in the water and sauna after the massage but this was not possible but in Japan it actually is..The massage was good but I had better ones. Usually at the end of the massage, they give you a paper to rate your massage experience and this is where you could give your tipps. Unfortunately, I didn't know at all that it is common to tip after the massage. If only I knew before... I think the Onsen experience is a unique one. It was my first time at an Onsen so I cannot tell if this one is considered to be good or not but I can still remember that one bath was extremely hot, where I could barely stay more than 1 minute in it.

You get there through the main roads or convoluted streets. you arrive, pay for your package and go. you get the usual electronic tags and stuff. You head to get to your yukata, go into the change room and go get cleaned for a soak. Only one pool is natural hot spring water transported from another part of thailand. the south i remember. the rest are just the usual heated tap water. it was nice except the hot spring water was heated just too hot. there are the usual sauna there as well. everything was hot. maybe a good time to go is dec to feb when bangkok is cooler. after a soak, you head back to change, go through the modern interiors for a relaxation sit or to the cafe. One good thing, the milk there is nice. try the melon or original. they are hokkaido milk from umm.. thailand?the food is ok. its sad the restaurant does not open during lunch. you are then ushered for your massages if you have booked for it. it is a communal area for foot rubs and thai massage. they do have some form of privacy curtain. for more up market rubs, there are pte rooms.here in after lies the problem. everything is nice until now. after a good rub down, you want to go back to the hot spring and no, you can't if you had an oil rub. But we will wash, nope you can't. that is strange. so all that is left to do is sit in the cafe, wait at the relaxation room and the lobby. After all this is bangkok. same same but different from japan.You get a ride on their tuk tuk to sukhumvit station. but on the next day, you try it, the counter says, sorry the tuk tuk guy was not working that day. but its in the brochure, you protest, ah same same but different.And why can't you get a lift there from sukhumvit station, its, bangkok.For a tip, set your expectations right, its a nice place. the service level is still not that of japan but its decent for a break in tokyo.would i go back? yea, after all i am still a hot spring lover and its the only one there. wished they had high or taller seats in the bath area though."

Spent about an hour and a half at the onsen - there are 6 pools. There weren't many people so it was really comfortable. However the steam room did not look very clean - that didn't stop me. Thereafter dried up and went for a body scrub and 2h massage, no complaints at all. Came with my mom and she enjoyed herself too! Prices are clearly stated on the website. We will return!"

This is cheaper than the chain massage parlours like Lets Relax, which has declined in my books in both value for money and attention to customers.Yunomori's masseuses are all great.

But they googled it, and a staff member walked me around to it. Lots of pools, sauna, steam room as described by others. I didn't have a massage but used the supplied kimono to wear while having nice food at their little cafe, then relaxing on a big soft chair. Also available are beds. You are also given a big towel, plus a very little one which is all you are allowed to take into the pools. There are good lockers. Between getting very hot with lots of naked males there are only four plastic chairs to sit on which often was not enough for all those there. Very relaxing to spend quite a long time there, but leave your inhibitions at the door. Plenty of cold water available to drink."

The service of the receptionist and service crews was excellent and never fail to make my day.Our appointment was at 3pm but we reached at 245pm due the the heavy traffic. I requested to push back my massage appointment by 15 minutes and the receptionist was thoughtful to understand my request immediately and arranged for us so that we can enjoy the onsen longer.I can see that they have upgraded the locker to keyless system, I hope to see more good changes coming. The only negative part is that they require us to shift our belongings to the massage room when we leave the onsen for massage. We do not need to shift our belongings during our last 2 visits. I understand that the management wants to prevent people who went for aromatherapy to go back to the onsen (oil will damage the onsen mineral), but it would good if they allow us to go back to shower because we have activities after the massage.Other than that, everything was good. The therapist did a great job understanding my needs and possesses gd skills.Despite being located at a very inaccessible place, it never stop me from patronizing this place. I will definitely go back to yunomori onsen when I visit Bangkok."

The receptionist were little bit rigid and not fluent in English, they can speak Japanese very well, maybe this is Japanese spa. The best way to choose spa item: read the details in web site or read the catalog which place on the reception and read by yourself, don't ask the receptionist.Need to aware that this shop may not easy to add or change some massage/onsen items due to the bad traffic jam and heavy rain in Bangkok. It's quite full, even we have requested 7 separate rooms for massage during the reservation. But when we go there again, she explains that they haven't enough rooms to entertain. When I paid 100 Baht to get a private room. I saw many private rooms were available. I think it maybe insufficient masseurs to provide massage service. The onsen and massage service were very good. I have tried twice in this spa. One was 2 hours aromatic oil massage without Onsen and add 45 mins body scrub item; Another was that I cannot add 45 mins body scrub and change 2 hours Thai massage to 2 hours Aroma massage with onsen. And I cannot have separate room even we have requested on the reservation. But I can get private room if I pay 100 baht. Finally, i have to pay 100 Baht to get private room. Not expensive. But I still cannot add 45 mins body scrub if I don't change the massage from 2 hours to 1 hour."

Having been to onsens in Japan and Korea, Yunomori is as authentic as the ones there and even better due to the variety of onsens offered. There are six pools, one bath and one steam room. Instructions are clear, you can take your time to read them on the walls and not feel intimidated even though it may be your first time.Black disposable underwear are available for free, so it is up to the individual's discretion if you prefer to wear them or go in naked. The Yukatas (robes) are thick and comfortable. I saw guests wearing them and hanging around the cafe and the restaurant. There are lockers for each guest to keep your belongings and slippers provided as well.We had the Thai body massages before going for the onsen. Do note that you won't be allowed to enter the onsen after an aromatherapy massage session due to the residue oil on your body, so plan your schedule properly or ring the spa and ask for their advice.Jap restaurant offers good food and It was full on a Tuesday night. We had to wait a while for a table for four. Thereafter, we proceeded for a round of foot massage which was equally good. Masseuses are polite, helpful and offer good service so if you like their service, do bring some cash along to tip them.Would suggest setting aside about four hours to enjoy the facilities. You don't feel like you are in the city anymore. Good way to recharge from the shopping and market visits. I will definitely make it a point to visit again the next time I am in Bangkok!"

Free rtn shuttle svc by tuktuk bck to train stn.I was lucky to get an immediate appmnt as i did not make any prior bkgs. My pkg was 60min thai mssg + the use of onsen. After choosing the type of mssg i needed (I chose hard mssg), the therapist guided me to change n put my things in a locker thn brought me to a big rooms with mssg beds divided only by curtains.As requested, the mssg was truely hard beyond wht i expected. Being egoistic i just kept quiet n took the mssg as per se, ha ha. Overall i shd say it was one of the best thai mssg i've hd.Next the onsen - it's clean with diff types of pools n varied temperatures. Thrs an instructions on the wall telling u hw to use the various pools. Thrs also a sauna n steam room. Outside thrs another pool, deck chairs n a few tubs whr u can also soak ur body to relax.One negative points is tht the shower area is a bit slippery due to left overs of soap suds n shampoo used by bathers. I almost slip while walking thr. It shd be cleansed more often.Tht aside, its worth visiting. I'll definitely come bck again during my nxt visit to bkk."

Good thing there were a cozy restaurant and onsen we could dip into to while away the 2 hours. Their onsen is clean but small. Shower area similar to the scenes of those in Korea, except they do not provide toiletries. After our dip in the onsen, we were given traditional robes to wrap ourselves in and headed to gather at their cafe/restaurant. The food was good and a lot of thought has been put into presentation which I totally appreciate. Price range is very affordable at SGD5 for a plate of yummy curry chicken rice. Massage room is not very fantastic because it was quite bare. But thankfully our masseuse were good with their hands, thus overall a satisfying experience. Expect to spend about 2-3 hours there if you are going to experience the onsen and sit down for some food and beverage."

My friend and I couldn't get a cab, so we ended up walking for 20min from Phrom Pong BTS to Yunomori Spa in the sweltering Bangkok heat.Staff were friendly, although we were annoyed that the first receptionist we encountered refused to help us book a taxi to get back to our hotel, claiming that taxis usually don't come by the area. Our massage would end at 11pm and you expect two female tourists to walk out to the main road from the secluded area??? We approached a male staff (he appeared to be the Japanese boss) after our massage for help and he promptly got a cab for us in less than 5min.The massage itself was nothing short of wonderful. We had booked a 90min aromatherapy massage. The therapists would first ask you to fill in your particulars on a form and you can indicate which parts of the body you want him/her to concentrate on during the massage. We could choose the type of massage oil based on the samples they brought to us, as well as the intensity of pressure (soft/medium/hard).Overall it was a good experience, and I'd love to come back again for the onsen."

When you check in, you swap your shoes for sandals and make your way to the changing rooms. You are given towels, a yukata, obi belt and mesh swimwear for modesty. Near the lockers are mirrors, hairdryers, combs/brushes and body lotion. Shampoo, conditioner, and soap are provided in the bathing area. I enjoyed the mineral and soda plunge pools, steam room, and mineral shower. I used the cold plunge pool frequently to prevent overheating. The onsen provides a water cooler to help stay hydrated. This is very important because I got very dizzy from dehydration during my first visit. I didn't get any massages, but remember that they require appointments for them. The facilities are clean and tastefully decorated. Staff are aplenty.There's nothing quite like Yunomori Onsen outside of Japan. Whether you live in Bangkok or just visiting, it's totally worth checking out. You won't be disappointed."

The staff were also very polite and helpful and seemed to be multilingual. Guests included people of a large number of nationalities including many Japanese. I live in Tokyo and I was struck to see many people with tattoos since tattoos are banned at many bathing facilities in Japan. I was happy that they could bathe comfortably here,I enjoyed a 90 minute aromatherapy massage and the massage therapist was excellent. Guests fill out a form before the massage outlining any problem areas, and the therapist checked with me several times during the massage to make sure I was comfortable. My foot started to cramp at on point and before I could tell the therapist, he put a cushion under my foot. Very attentive.I look forward to visiting Yunomori Onsen again.

We have discovered a very good real Japanese Onsen in Bangkok , Ynomori is only less than 2 years open , located at the end of Soi 24 Sukhumvit on A Square. It is not just a regular public Spa and massage shop, this is a real typical Japanese kind of bath house, separate area for men & women with different kind of hot and cold tubs, inside & outdoors patio , sauna and steam room, showers, locker room, a relax area with healthy drinks ( & beer ) and snacks , at the second level nice treatment rooms for different kind of massage, it's all listed at reasonable prices and they have promotions also.It's a bit of a walk from Sukhumvit BTS station but when we entered the reception area we have been greeted with a warm welcome from the staff, we paid the entrance fee and booked already for a 1.5h massage afterwards, the professional staff members explain you very clearly how it all works and guide you every where, one can see that a foreign management is behind this business and for sure not run the Thai way. We received slippers; a towel and a kimono changed our clothes for less. Note that the wet area does not allows bikini or swimwear, it's all in your \" natural Adam or Eve costume \" as it is custom in Japan , so if you are shy don't go there. The massage afterwards was excellent and done by real professional masseuses. The whole place is very big and nicely decorated in wood Japanese style, very clean and run by friendly staff. They provide a return taxi ride by Tuk Tuk till the Sukhumvit road. Only one negative point is that they made a mistake on our consumption bill which was by mistake overcharged but we have seen it only when back in the hotel, I called them and explained the situation, the lady told me she would figure out what happen but never rang me back as promised. Yes the mosquitos love me but that's part of a wet area and the nature.My wife and I used to go to often to Onsen when travelling for business in Japan but must say that we have been very satisfied with this one at another part of Asia, for sure we will visit this Yunomori Onsen again next time when back in Bangkok."

They were very sorry for my displeasure and ensure me that they will look into the matter and would inform their manager about it. So I left the place and I was really sad having to come all the way here and not getting the much anticipated massage that I so long for. However, what happen next really makes me think this is one professional place and they really take care of their customers. In the evening, they actually called me and the GM ( I shall not disclose his name here - he is a japanese) spend a good part of the night finding out what actually happen and tried his very best with his limited english to answer my queries. I was touched with his professionalism and gesture. He then promise me to reply me in an email and update me the steps which the company would take towards the matter. Which my lord he really did in the next few days. He then proceed to explain to me that is not that the masseur is not doing his job rather is that he misunderstand my needs and what i specify. I am happy with his explanation and I will confidently recommend to any who wants to have a professional massage here. I will be going back again in February and would love to meet up with him as he did give me a complimentary massage as I didn't get to complete the 2 hours Thai massage that I have booked. so Verdict is .... Great Place, Great service, Great Management..PS. If I am not mistaken, they will be opening one in Singapore Soon .. look out for it"

The entrance fee of THB450 is a really good deal and the staff are very friendly too. I've tried the massage there once and it was good. Yes, it's advisable to book in advance if you wish to have a massage there and go earlier to enjoy the onsen as you won't be allowed back after your (oil) massage as the water would get oily even after you have had a good bath.One reviewer mentioned that there is free tuk-tuk to and from Phrom Phong BTS station. As far as I know, they only provide the service one way from the onsen to the BTS station. And yes, it's a long but interesting walk from the BTS station to the onsen itself. Depending on your walking speed, it took me about 20min. A Square is located opposite K Village and it's right at the end after the car parking area."

It's super relaxing, extremely clean and wonderfully decorated. Being able to smoke, drink and eat a bit of a snack outside in between baths or massage sessions is a delight. The only downside is that you get eaten alive by mosquitos when outside. I recommend they put coils around, but still 5 stars."

My wife heard from a Japanese friend about this place, so we gave it a try. We did not regret that. I lived in Japan for many years, and my wife is Japanese, so we know onsens very well. This place did not disappoint. The service is great. They have staff that speak English and Japanese and the front desk is very organized and quick. I recommend getting the package deal for a bath and a massage. It is a pretty good value. You go soak in the different baths for about 1-2 hours. Then head up to a Massage room for 1 hour. Afterwards, you are floating on Cloud 9. You can even order a draft beer between sessions and you can pay when you check out. Amazing. I have been there twice already and I planning on returning soon."

You have a variety of 6 different onsens to choose from and there's even a Happy Hour promotion. Staff were all very friendly and the place was clean and well maintained. We took the signature package which includes a body scrub, aromatherapy massage & thai herbal compress. We paid about THB2,200 for the treatment. Affordable experience in Bangkok. Will consider coming back again. Only downside is they provide a one way shuttle from the onsen to the BTS station. You'll need to make your own way by cab to the onsen itself as it's quite a long walk from the nearest BTS station."

            "review": "EXCELLENT!! Do NOT miss it!. As travelers to Japan and connoisseurs of Japanese culture we were thrilled to find an onsen in Thailand ( where we live! ) The concept of having a place like this to unwind and relax is one of the delights of living in Japan and we applaud the owners/ developers in their efforts to establish this in Bangkok. We have been to Yunomori Onsen three times within the past two weeks and intend to make it a regular stop when we are in the city. It is beautifully managed and maintained with friendly and knowledgeable staff. The entry \"lobby\" is a place I could spend all day. Elegantly but simply decorated with comfortable couches and even rocking chairs. In a word: homey. Massage is available of course, at rates higher than many places in Bangkok. . .but I will not write about massage in this review. I only had one and I dont want to base a review on a single experience. This was an oil massage and I will note it is awkward not to be able to return to the onsen area after an oil massage but I understand that it is difficult to remove all the oil from one's skin in one bathing and it \"pollutes\" the baths. Onsen need to be super clean of course. You can return to your locker in the onsen area to change. At 450 baht for entrance fee ( 250 for seniors) it is a real bargain! You can spend the day either in the various onsen baths, hot and cold, \"Jacuzzi\" sauna, teak tubs, steam room etc. Having visited many onsen in Japan, I would not describe it as small but rather as average compared to the ones we frequented in Osaka and Kyoto. Even with 40-50 men in there it never felt crowded. You get a yukata ( robe) to wear out to the little cafe where the food and beverage offerings were varied and the choices we made satisfying. The key number charging system makes it easy to order what you want and then pay as you leave. . There is also a relaxing room where you can take a nap.The only thing we missed was an actual outdoor area like we have seen in Japan where you can see the sky & the stars at night. The \"outdoor\" area here has a roof over it. . but of course it is in the middle of Bangkok and \"outdoor\" may just not be possible. All in all an experience not to be missed. . .especially if you have not been to Japan and experienced this incredibly civilized ( the Romans had the same idea) part of Japanese culture."

While waiting for my turn for massage - 2 hours, I went into the onsen. However after my massage, i was informed that I was not allowed to use the onsen bath again. But I was allowed to do so last time in July? How ridiculous? There was a restaurant in the area, but selling limited foods and some of them were of order."

It's more of a modern onsen, with different types of baths you can get in and out of. But one thing's the same and that's bathing in the nuddy - gender separated, in case you're wondering. The decor looked good, facilities were pretty clean, and staff were very helpful, showing me how to use the facilities on learning it was my first visit. It's not tiny, but not a large place either. During my visit on a week night, there were maybe 20 guys there without getting too crowded. I do imagine if it gets a bigger crowd, you'll need to be comfortable with the inevitable skin contact.There's a cafe in the building, along with a garden where you can have Asahi beer dressed in the yutaka they provide. A good way to end the experience after a nice, relaxing soak. Didn't have time to try the massage unfortunately. Maybe next time."

I concur - could not have been a better way to end a short trip to bangkok!Reservations and queries were promptly answered to. We visited on the last day after 2 days of shopping and walking around. After checking in, a staff promptly ushered us to get changed into slippers and into the onsen where I spent a good half hr. Could have been longer but we were a bit pressed for time. It was just so relaxing with the hot spring, cold spring and steam room! You can enjoy walking ard the spa with a yukata!The therapist was professional, attentive and her massage techniques were excellent. Did a 1 hr massage followed by 1/2 hr herbal press which is a MUST TRY if you have sore shoulders and back. Instant relief!The entire package costs me 1000 baht which is a pretty good deal and comparable to the other places you get around town.The atmosphere in the spa was calm and peaceful and very clean. After a spa, one can also relax by the cafe or the japanese restaurant. They serve excellent ginger tea there for 60 baht!It can be a bit difficult to get to this spa from Phrom POng station - I would advice you to cab it there all the way! Be sure to give some allowance for bad traffic! Taxis are also scarce around the area. However, iwth their excellent service, a girl went out to the main area to grab us a cab and they even called our hotel to inform them of late check out as we were running slightly late!Loved the experience so much - they;ve got themselves a loyal customer!"

I had a 4 hour treatment at a day spa when I landed in Bangkok and found it somewhat lacking. The treatment itself was good, but the ambience was a little empty. Not to mention that I think I deserve better than those 300 baht massages in cramped, creepy establishments with very little privacy where your nothing more than a lump of flesh to be poked and prodded. So, I arrived at the reception in Yunomori already impressed by the very quiet, peaceful, Zen-like atmosphere and top-quality customer service. I recommend that you book your Onsen and treatment before you get there as bookings fill up fast in the evenings. The staff take care of you from the moment you walk in. You're given a locker key for your belongings and taken to a room where you take off your shoes and are given slippers. You're then directed to your treatment room (if you choose to have one). Afterwards, you're shown to the Onsen (a guide on how to use it is in the reception and change room so you won't miss a beat).The Onsen and locker room areas are kept clean, quiet and tranquil. The patrons also keep to the spa etiquette and remain quiet and well-behaved. No loud, annoying tourists here. The facilities in the women's change rooms are thoughtful. They provide a high powered hair dryer, lotions, shampoo, conditioner and other toiletries for you to freshen yourself up. I don't know what it was in that water, but this place made me the most relaxed than I've ever been. Value for money is quite excellent. I paid 1190 baht for a 90 minute aromatherapy massage and Onsen. They have an array of packages or a la carte treatments. I'll definitely be returning on an almost daily basis during my future trips to Bangkok.The cafe serves great bites and drinks. The garden and outdoor area was fabulous.

We arrived at noon and the lobby was a bit noisy - a lack of serenity, which is something we appreciate in spa. But not a big flaw. Staff could not be friendlier. Love it. The core topic: the massage. The two masseurs performed well. We were asked of the details: which parts of our bodies should be focused, the intensity of the massage, a choice of 3 oils to choose from. We were later led to the private room on the 2nd level. The room appears to be spotlessly clean. Appreciated. Then, I saw the nice surprise on the wall ----- please see the attached pic here and test your eyesight. I do not have a cockroach-phobia. I am not complaining. Very unexpected to find a small companion during our massage. But ... it's Japanese-standard cleanliness, right?I think the Jap owner may die of shame. Ha ha ha ..."

An average place that is not too easy to find (our cab driver had to make many rounds in the area before he found it despite the instructions from our hotel and the full address of the spa). It is a huge place, very clean and polite service. But I think it lacks ambience. For example, I do not see any plant/ floral arrangement nor hear any music. It was just awfully quiet with only mutters and whispers from the people at the spa.The onsen was ok, they had 1 jacuzzi pool and 3 hot tubs of varying temperatures. The massage room was clean and basic. But my masseur was very good. We opted for a 90 min massage and 30 min herbal compress. She was consistent throughout and very skillful. I feel rested and relaxed after the session.That said, the treatment was quite expensive considering that it is Bangkok. We paid 1,800 THB. each. But if u get a good masseur that it's worth the price tag. May revisit again."

Everything about this place is luxurious and although it may not be considered \"cheap\" for Thai standards, as an Australian I would never be able to experience this kind of pampering at home so I am really glad I spoiled myself a little here. You begin by choosing what you would like off the menu (I went the whole hog and got the scrub, massage and herbal compress) I was directed to the spa room to wash, receive my locker and kimono gown and to spend some time in the mineral pools. All of the facilities were of a fantastic standard and I felt like a roman princess. My therapist was divine and although English was hard for her she was welcoming and friendly and very professional. During the treatment I thought I almost could take any more pleasure, it was so enjoyable. Once finished there is an area where you can prepare yourself for the outside world again, with hairdryers, mirrors, hair ties etc. Such a delicious experience."

I am a spa junkie esp in bkk where choices are abundant and prices insanely affordable. Tried almost everything at yunomori. the entire ambience, d\u00e9cor, mood, cleanliness, services were top notch. Not much of an onsen person but gave it a try just to immerse myself with the full experience. Most impt thing would be hygiene and cleanliness as most authentic onsen requires one to go in in full monty glory and yunomori managed to keep it clean with cleaners constantly wiping away water on wet floor. that was a plus. cute kimonos were handled out to wear as you lounge around the spa before your massage. the space looks huge, yet, easy enough to navigate and familiarize yourself. Did a 3 hours aroma massage with herbal compress. therapists were courteous and skills were good except that I asked for \"firm\" which supposed to be the strongest comparing to \":medium\" and \"soft\" but it felt like medium to me. No problem on that as I kinda pitied the masseur who have to knead me for 3 straight hours. The Japanese restaurant within the spa was excellent. Very fresh tasting and the yakitori dishes were comparable to those I had in japan. overall, it was a gem and I went there with friends twice within 2 days. Highly recommend if you want to restore some peace and looking for a quiet place to unwind and untie those knots. we all did. AWESOME."

The one nearest to the bathing area is the least hot and should be the first pool you hop into to get yourself warmed up.

There is a mini garden area where the sauna rooms and another warm pool is located.We booked a massage so entry to the onsen was at a discounted rate. I did the thai massage while my friend did the aromatherapy massage. The massage was done in a nice and clean massage room and the standard is quite good.

The last trip it was my mission to find the place and go. I committed by making a reservation on the internet. To walk from the BTS is about 30 minutes. Best option, depending on the time of day, is a taxi. The facility is located near K Village. I opted for the ONSEN and a 90 minute oil massage on the three occasions I went. The checking in process was efficient. They take your shoes, provide you will slippers and then guide you to the Onsen. Robes of all sizes are available, I am on the larger end of the spectrum. Instructions are very clear, if this is your first time do not hesitate to ask them questions or read the documentation. In the female side you are offered some netting for modesty, this was unlike the experiences I have had in Japan so I appreciated this additional touch. The change rooms were adequate and have drinking water for hydration. Shampoo, conditioner and body wash are provided as well. Then there are six steps of the ONSEN that you can partake of. It was great. Plunging from the hot into the cold water was wonderful. If you have a massage booked after the ONSEN they will come and remind you that your appointment is soon. My 90 minute massage was heaven after the baths. I felt every knot was worked on and I walked out feeling like I was walking on air. And when you consider the price, it is worth every single dollar. I believe I paid B1200 for the two. There are many other options, with foot massage, no oil etc. They also have a beauty therapist on hand, restaurant, caf\u00e9 etc. If it was not so out of the way of where I stay, I would go there daily."

Grandma didn't go into the spa area, just a foot massage, but my cousin and I had a fun time in the spa. They do try to take care of the non Japanese customers, providing us with disposable bras and undies to wear (normally people get naked), and posting instructions on what to do, how to wear the yukata, etc. I love soaking myself in the little wooden barrel in the outside area. Earlier reviews of this place mentioned a pool with tom yum spices and coconut in it but I didn't see it, to my disappointment. Even if you don't use the spa, I'd highly recommend coming to this place just for a massage. At 350 Baht a hour, it's an excellent value. Not to mention that the masseurs are top notch. They know how to work out the knots without pushing too hard. It's not always the harder the better when it comes to massage and sadly not all masseurs know that. These guys did an excellent job. Also, while we were late for the appointment (we thought they would come into the spa area to call us) they did not cut back our time. All the staff is very friendly and courteous, the place is very clean and tranquil. I just wish this place is not half the world the away from me!"

I tend to go late in the evenings when there is a smaller crowd, that way I can enjoy all the \"pools\", the cold,hot,soda and bubbling jacuzzi. Like me, many just use the dry sauna and ump into the really cold bath, then repeat. You will leave refreshed, clean and completely relaxed. Definitely helps me get a good night sleep too!.

We traveled to Bangkok often and it's been difficult to find a good masseuse lately and one who doesn't insist on a tip. I'm all fine with giving tips but it's such a put off when they openly ask for it. The whole place looks like a Japanese traditional onsen with wooden structure. Nice and clean.

I met a guy earlier that day at lunch who was super cool and talked to me about this place that was down the street from my hotel. I was in Bangkok in Jan 2014 during the protests, and this night was a particularly bad one where it was ill-advised to go to places like Silom and Lumpini. So I stuck around Sukhumvit. My friend texted me and told me to arrive at 8pm at the Onsen. First, it's NOT where Google Maps says it is. It's in a larger shopping center to the south of the intersection marked on Google Maps. But once I found it, the results were both hilarious and relaxing. I felt like the Accidental Tourist, entering and paying and yet still having no idea what to do/where to go/customs to follow. Eventually I ended up in the men's locker room (good thing), where nakedness was simply a state of being. Being an American from the relatively uptight Northeast, it was a bit unnerving; but what is travel supposed to do but take you out of your comfort zone? I shirked my robes and proceeded to the actual bath-house, where I must admit - it was incredibly relaxing. The different pools and steam rooms really do help soak the stress away; and the social aspect (which, admittedly, is still a bit weird when everyone's \"hanging\" out), was enjoyable too. I'd totally do it again, but probably only in Asia where there are less hangups about naked bodies. I could totally see doing this in Japan (where I've never been), but not so much in Washington, DC (where I currently live). But if you have an empty night - or need a chill night - in Bangkok, certainly check this place out."

At first, I was worried about being completely nude but after a few minutes, you remember what it was like not to care about being nude in front of others. I feel very safe when at the Onsen. You will see many Japanese business men and some with children. I didn't realize how normal it was. It renews my faith in humanity. You can tell the Japanese guys because they like to chat and they are very comfortable in their bodies of all shapes and sizes. If you don't have six pack abs, you won't be alone. For the experience, the price is worth every Satang. You can take a break in the shaded common area where you can drink an Asahi beer, read the papers provided, have a coffee or snack, smoke, or call your friend and tell them to join you next time.

This review is based on 4 visits to the Men's Onsen.Visits were between 14:00 and 18:00 using only the Onsen related facilities, I did not have a massage or treatment but may do so going forward.It is notable that Yunomori Onsen is getting popular, almost too crowded, particularly after 17:00.Almost Great...why?.... (See wish list at the end pls)Well I watched as the project was built and had (and still have) great expectations.It is very nice, very clean and the best facility of its kind in the city today, as far as I can tell.I am a big fan of Japanese design, Onsen, as well as steam and sauna culture. I have visited many Onsen in Japan and Taiwan as well as many hot springs in Thailand and Asia and am a regular at the better local \u2018hamams\u2019 in Bangkok, the local equivalent of Yunomori Onsen at about \u00bd the price...The reception is busy, but efficient as I only wanted to use the Onsen.I paid under 500 THB, was issued a locker key and shown on to the 'check-in\u2019 shoe/slipper area, an experience that is clumsy and awkward, but not too bad.On entry to the locker and wet areas, one is given 1 large and 1 small towel (more on this later) and a yukata, you also check your slippers here\u2026they are not used in the locker and wet areas. From here onward, there were only Phillipino staff.The locker area is well designed, finished, appointed, staffed (more later) and ventilated with abundant natural light. It is a bit crowded when busy.NOTE: They have begun spraying \u2018air freshener\u2019 in the locker room AND on the towels in the locker. I think this cheapens the entire experience big time.You remove your clothes and enter the sit-down-shower/wet area with the Small Towel Only.Yup, for those shy folks to note, it is a small towel, too small to wrap around even the thinnest waist to conceal the smallest of equipment.You enter the \u2018wet\u2019 area featuring traditional Japanese \u2018sit down\u2019 shower area, the various Onsen pools, steam, and outdoor sauna area.One is supposed to shower, and be properly clean before entering a bath, steam or sauna, so this is the first thing you should do\u2026The wet area has high ceilings, natural light and generally well designed facilities although there is little room to move around when it is busy.(Note- It is a pity that the interior contractor never fixed the finishing details like the paint, few places with blue PVC pipe etc....I hope you get to that Management)) There is an open air, covered and enclosed garden with Sauna, terrazzo onsen and 2 one-man teak soaking tubs and about 5 plastic garden chairs (ugh yuck).Here is the biggest let down...there is no place to sit, relax and cool down/sweat...such an important part of a good Onsen/Sauna experience but...... ...something that owners and designers always omit, ....for what ever reason...The Onsen claims to use trucked-in spring water in addition to the 'engineered' water in one particular bath.However, I have never seen a water truck and presume there is a filtration process and water quality test?? Smelled chlorine last time i was there...There is a water jet bath with about 8 seats, a long hot still pool for up to 15, the engineered soda bath for about 8 and a small cold dip bath in the indoor area as well as the steam room and a standing shower.The steam is well designed with a glass wall, hone finished terrazzo benches and hot. Overall good, but incorporation of thai herbs in the Steam would be a great plus.The engineered bath is interesting and feels effervescent, the cold dip pool was nicely cold and the others were well designed with good seats and hot.Outdoor area is nice with light, plants and moving water. The sauna was hot, spacious but smelled of air freshener, yuck, thus i didnt use it for long -The outdoor onsen was very nice and the one man teak buckets were pleasant.My Wish List-Get rid of the air freshener! (from the locker/towels and sauna)- Cool Down Relaxation Area with generous seating - ie more garden area please!- Expand or control numbers of people in the wet area- Provide drinking water inside the wet areas, current single location is really bad!-Use Thai Herbs in the Steam and Eucalyptus in the Sauna - - Open another location in my neighborhood-and...not to be called 'sir' so oftenConclusion -I will be back and hope at least the air freshener thisng has ceased.Compared to say, Silom Sauna on Soi 22, (THB 180, similar facilities, not as clean, free herb drinks, fruit and deserts), Yumomori is still worth it if it dosent get too crowded or w/ too many 'cruiser' types,,,ugh, pls go to babalyon"

We had the whole day to kill in Bangkok and this is THE best way to do it without spending too much."

(by the way it's just located behind A Square after the carpark area)arrived at a very quaint and tranquil looking building, almost reminiscent of rural japan if u blink an eye and not notice the tall buildings behind.booked the aromatherapy for 2hrs at 1100baht (very very reasonable given the ambience of the place) skill of masseur was very good, targeting pressure points and problem areas (you fill out a questionnaire before commencing the session highlighting to the masseur the areas you want focused on and areas u prefer to be left alone) after paying for the session you're immediately whisked away to the 2nd level where the private therapy rooms are located, you're given time to take a quick rinse and the therapy session will begin immediately. (the 2hrs is not inclusive of your shower which some other massage joints do, so you get the gist? :)I drifted off to sleep many times during the session because it was simply relaxing and good! the pressure points I wanted focused on were attended to by a professional.the session ended with a hot compress which was very uplifting.I didn't get to try the onsen as I didn't set aside time for that but I guess I'm gonna visit it again for sure and will definitely try the onsen. overall a very very good experience at this place and I have nothing else to add but do your tired back and aching shoulders a favor and visit it! :D"

The \"system\" is consistent - you walk in butt naked, shower and dip in. you will also see both hot/ steam sauna within its premises. Interestingly, it seems to be rather crowded even during week day office hours. one highlight, it comes with optional massage services at an additional cost to its entrance fee. Admittedly, the layout seems pleasantly calming (designed by Japanese). Overall it did reminds me of Japan - perhaps, its time I should revisit Japan."

The place is spacious and has hot bath of various temperature and a cold one. There is a cafe, jap beer (asahi) draft and massage. Price wise is decent. Many food/pub options nearby. Now for cons, the location is no way convenient. The spa claims to have shuttle service every half hour back and prat pong bts, but when we asked for a trip back to bts, they said \"driver\". So no driver today or no driver ever, I cannot be sure. Be prepared for traffic jam to and from the place as the roads are narrow and only one lane each way. We had better luck walking there (30minutes) than in a cab as the traffic was jam packed. As for the hot bath, it's is separated between male and female. So couple going there can forget about soaking in hot bath together. Chances are you will be soaking with other males/stranger naked. Yes, naked, as in the authentic Japanese style. They only allow you to enter the hot bath with only a handkerchief sized towel to cover up or wash with. Hence, it is good to hang out with your buds or girlfriend. massage is forgettable and food wise, go for other places, there are tons of options nearby."

They have some great specials going on now, and I got a massage included with my Onsen. It was one of the best massages I\u2019ve gotten in Thailand, although this may be because I was already relaxed from sitting in hot baths before.

The massage was too weak and I have to tell her 3 times to make it harder. She was like not that happy about it. Slowly when back to the weaker state and I give up telling her. To make matter worse she pressed on my knee joint quite a few times. Lastly the leg rest is all cracked which really make one uncomfortable when your leg is on it.Well the only good thing and the reason it's not one star is the recepition is friendly and the place is pretty clean. The recepition did apologize for it and that's it. Maybe it's just my luck for getting the wrong person.My advice, don't expect much from the place and if you really want a massage here ask for someone stronger or just let them know beforehand what kind of pressure you look for.

The venue is 5 mins walk from a BTS stop and you enter through a very discreet private passage and up some stairs. The decor is sophisticated, in shades of grey and you can choose to have music playing if you want. As well as enjoying a very relaxing and therapeutic massage, you can know that you are contributing to the care of the blind, who are dependent on such support, there being no other care for them in Thailand.

I can only describe the next 60 minutes as pleasure and pain. We did ask for a firm massage as we had aches and pains from travelling around Malaysia and Thailand. Upon writing this review a good few hours have past and we are both feeling less tense, more relaxed and definitely with less aches and pains than we did prior to the massage. It cost 450 baht each for 60 minutes and is worth every penny. We also tipped our massage therapists as they did a good job.

Once upon a time, I was wandering around the streets of Phnom Penh, by myself, when I started talking to a local gentleman, in the central market. He asked me what I was looking for, and I said a massage (not that kind of massage, silly!). He very exuberantly recommended blind massage, which was a brand new concept to me. Sadly, I didn't have time to indulge while in Cambodia. Upon returning to Bangkok, however, a quick google search informed me that I should go to Perception Blind Massage, and check this out! Getting there was fun - a mix of metro exploration, followed by wandering through some residential areas of Bangkok. Cool! Upon arrival, I ascended the stairs, and was greeted by inspirational passages like \"The eyes are useless, when the mind is blind.\" I love this place already. I naturally didn't have an appointment, and was told it would be about an hour and a half wait, and if I was interested, I could come back, or wait downstairs, in the cafe. The cafe was lovely. The coffee drinks were absolutely amazing, the people were friendly, and there was wi-fi. No problem! When it was my time, I went upstairs and met with my masseuse and went to my massage bed. The massage was fantastic. Parts were a bit different from any massage I'd had before, but everything was professional and of the highest quality. I felt well looked after, well massaged, and well relaxed by the time I left. I have a great appreciation for my experience at Perception. I would recommend this place to anyone traveling to Bangkok, who loves massage (and if you love massage, Thailand is the place to go)!"

Being regular patrons to massage and foot massage for most of our adult life, my husband and I had always wanted to try a blind masseuse. We were both aware that with lack of sight, a good blind masseuse would be able to be in tune with muscles in a way that a seeing person cannot. We always said we would enjoy this experience, but really had never had the opportunity to try until our recent trip to Bangkok because a qualified blind masseuse is not easy to find. We had a great experience and would recommend Perception to anyone seeking a similar experience. Not only did we have a thorough, extensive, complete, detailed two hour Thai style massage for two hours (for only $700 each) by staff that is fully trained and certified to be providing such services, we had a great experience inside the facility. Perception is clean, professional, welcoming and comfortable. Perception has a good website to answer any questions I had prior to arrival and they were also quick to follow up when I booked our appointments a week in advance over e-mail. Do book in advance, for although walk-ins would be welcomed, I am thinking available spots to a walk in might be limited. When you arrive, you will be welcomed in a small reception area and then escorted to your area/massage bed and provided house slippers. You select soft, medium or firm massage levels and indicate any problem areas on a client form. This information is then shared to blind or sight impaired masseuse assigned to you via the \"seeing\" receptionist.For Thai massage, you will be provided a tasteful pair of fine linen loose pants and a shirt that you will wear during your massage. On a side note, I like that this professional, clean establishment is a professional, honest career for a masseuse that happens to be blind. This place is full of good karma!"

Nothing short of amazing. I've been to many massage parlors all over Asia (and many different types -5 star hotels to little alley places) & one of the things that separated this place was before the massage we got a write up/bio of our masseuses & their blindness - related history & general personal interests & total experience level.

Great atmosphere but the masseuse I had was ill & if your profession involves working in close proximity to people, when ill they should be given time off to recover & also so as not to pass it on to who ever is getting a massage from them. I asked for 'Medium' pressure & was in pain while legs were being worked on (I hate to think what hard pressure would have been!). The lovely receptionist came to check one time if pressure was ok & unfortunately I said yes it's fine as didn't want to upset the masseause & thought I'd be able to bare it as it had to be nearly time to move into back. Had a minor limp for a couple of minutes after massage had finished (felt like cramp) but that went after had walked a couple of blocks. Had high hopes but wouldn't go back based on experience I had, high score given for ambiance & idea but not the actual massage unfortunately. Sorry, have to be honest."

We had the appointment set at 12pm. While we were on the BTS, the receptionist called to inform us that, there will be a 20 minutes delay due to some unforeseen circumstances, which was not an issue at all.(B) Getting ThereWe stayed at Eastin Grand Hotel Sathorn, just one BTS station away from Surasak - Chong Nonsi. Follow exit 3 & look for Standard Chartered Building. Once you are approaching the building, look for Soi 8. It's quite easy to spot Dexter Cafe. Perception Blind Massage is located on the 2nd floor. Take the narrow staircase, you will see the inspiring wording that worth a few photographs.(C) EnvironmentThe receptionist was very kind, pleasant & spoke perfect English. The air-conditioning was cool & such a saviour in the afternoon. The restroom was clean & well-maintained. While we enjoyed the drinks, we filled the questionnaire on what we wanted for the Thai Massage. We opted for a private room, which has 2 beds at the extra cost 100 baht. The room was equipped with air-conditioning as well. (D) 2 Hour Thai MassageThere were clean shirt & trouser provided. We get a massuer & masseuse. Both of them were professional & very polite. We requested deep tissue massage & their exceptional technique delivered perfectly with their strong hands. The massage was covered in such a great detail. It was the best massage that we ever get. They had some kind of alarm which buzz 2-3 times during massage, which might serve as time interval. But that's really not something to complaint about. Our phones getting a lot more buzzing from the disastrous-incoming-messages-flood!(E) ConclusionComing to this place is not for you to show the sympathy about how unfortunate they are for being partially/fully vision-impaired. In fact, it is for you to do yourself a favor to get a real pampering. I was hoping I could squeeze some time for a 2nd massage, which I didn't. But, I believe such a great place will be in business for a long time & it's just the matter if I could get an appointment the next time."

The massage was excellent and healing...my masseur zeroed in on my lower back pain and melted the pain with his well trained touch.

The massage was just what we needed to start off our vacation! We would say it is combines aspects of a sports massage and deep tissue/pressure point massage. Honestly, it spoiled us for any other type of massage. Our masseuses were incredible and able to seek out our trouble areas. We are active/athletic and have issues with tight muscles/joints as a result. Our therapists were able to work away a lot of these issues in just one session! The price is very reasonable.

Thai massage uses pressure points, so it is not just like a rubdown. Having a blind practitioner was a unique experience, and the setting was quiet and peaceful. Upon registration, you are asked about problem areas and what needs special attention. I chose medium level of pressure. I will include photos of the location and entrance since others have had difficulty finding it. It seemed easy to find and only a block from a skytrain station, Soi 8. Maybe 100 meters from Sathorn road north, upstairs in the same building as Dexter's."

The response to our enquiries and booking confirmation were informative and fast.Directions to the place were given and that really facilitated our smooth cab journey there during the late afternoon peak hours.The office was at the second floor. We were warmly welcomed and asked to complete a simple 1-page survey on details like physical conditions and to highlight on areas that require specific attention by the masseuse. Upon choosing the masseuse, we we're led to level 3 where the massage began on time as scheduled.The masseuse did a very thorough job according to the level of pressure we had indicated on the survey. They we're meticulous and gave the body massage in sequence, part by part and at times with repeated actions on the focused areas.We, inclusive of our teenage children agreed that it was a worthwhile and rejuvenating trip to Perception Blind Massage even it is situated at Sathorn. We felt great and body aches left us literally after the good rubbing till now. Highly recommend to all who are looking for a beneficial traditional massage in Bangkok!

We stayed at Metropolitan Hotel in Sathorn road so it was within walking distance. The only problem was there was no visible signage from afar - The parlour is actually on the 1st floor of the shophouse and the ground floor is a cafe/bar called Dexter (very visible sign from the main road). As for the parlour itself - it projects a calm and hip feeling. The masseurs are visually impaired so don't be surprised if you sometimes have a second person in the room with you to assist them in passing the oil or herbal balls. I chose the 90 mins thai massage, focusing on the shoulder blades and lower back. My masseuse did a fantastic job although I had to ask her to put a little less pressure. All in all, I enjoyed my first blind massage. Recommended for those looking for a different experience "

Upon visiting my husband and I were given a drink,asked to fill out a form about our preferences, and given information about our massage therapist. We changed into the Thai fisherman pants and a top and then our massage therapists were led in and began their work. It was a really cool experience and felt great after sightseeing in the heat the past few days. Afterwards we were given tea and a thank you in braille and able to sit until we were ready to go. I like what this business is offering. We did make an appointment (via email) before visiting."

It is located near Chong Nonsi station and just above Dexter Bar and Cafe which is also a great place. Warm welcome by the English speaking receptionist, she served me some water and handed me a one page background sheet about the blind therapist who was going to do my massage. The massage area is very nicely arranged, peaceful and comfortable. The massage was excellent, covered the whole body in 1 hour and left me feeling totally relaxed. Afterwards the receptionist offered me tea. I would definitely go again. Very affordable price, great massage and service."

She really managed to help ease all my sore spots and paid attention to my problem areas. They have interesting massage oil options as well. The receptionist spoke good English, and they very graciously allowed us to delay our appointment as we were running late. The location is a little obscure, on a small dusty road opposite an empty plot of land. Upon arrival, we got some water and a form on our problem areas or areas to avoid. I also appreciated that they let you take a quick shower before the massage, as we were tired and sweaty after walking over. Since it's a blind massage just be prepared for things like arranging the towel on your own when you turn over and having the masseuse occasionally stop to listen to the recording which directs them on your problem areas. Overall was a great experience!"

My sis masseur was not to standard. She kept on pinching her whole body instead of using various techniques. We did not experience the usual Thai massage where they stretched your body here & there, cracking some joints. Was disappointed especially it was highly ranked in trip advisor."

We didn't really know what to expect but felt strongly about supporting the therapists in their unique career in the spa industry. So we agreed to give it a try. We were greeted very warmly at the reception by a blind therapist who then also performed the massage for us. The treatment room was perfectly scentenced and very comfortable to enjoy the massage. We had a really relaxing massage and were very impressed with the quality of the treatment. There is certainly some magic to the special touch of massage by a blind person and the experience left some lasting memories to both of us. We will certainly go back and recommend it everyone."

Great, friendly and accomodating receptionist but the massage itself was not what I was expecting. I didn't experience that heightened sense of touch I was hoping to experience. I'm actually quite disapppointed. The room felt chilly. I asked the receptionist to turn it down and she did but even then, it was still too cold for me as the AC was right there facing the bed, blowing directly at you. The massage was just so-so. In the midst of the massage, the alarm clock kept on going off with this robotic voice 'low battery, please recharge' in English and in a few other languages. It went on for a while every 30 seconds or so and I was waiting for the massage therapist to do something about it, like calling in the receptionist in to fix it. She didn't. Since she didn't speak English, right after the alarm went off, I would make comments and say 'Off please' and she just laughed it off. This happens like 2 or 3 times. I was like 'Are you serious?!' I had enough and got up and called the receptionist myself. Receptionist turned it off right away and she was apologetic but the experience was already ruined for me. The lady gave me 100 THB discount at the end. And I appreciate her making the effort in pleasing her customer. Thus the 2 star review.I'm sticking with Healthland."

The atmosphere of the place is great, with meaningful decorations, massage room even with candle lights. Started with very good impression when the receptionist handed us a form to fill in with graphics to indicate if there are specific parts of the body that we would like to be taken care of. My mum's back was hurting a lot, the receptionist who speaks English well told the therapist to focus on my mum's back and it was helpful. I had a Thai massage and it was great, really authentic Thai massage, I can feel that the therapist really knew what he was doing. Felt so refreshed after the massage. My mum also felt better in her back after her aromatic oil massage. Definitely recommend. Plan to come again next time in Bangkok.

The location is very easy off Chong Nonsi BTS and the service was so refreshing!It was amazing to see the team work such respectable jobs and love what they do. Because the therapists are either partially or fully blind they seem to know where all your knots and places to concentrate on. I've had Thai Massages for many years and this has topped my list.

The warm and friendly receptionist speaks English well, and the professionalism is evident in the clean and contemporary surrounds, taking of your medical history and introduction to your therapist. The all important massage is tailored to suit your own requirements (mine was medium with attention to shoulders), and this is the first massage I have ever had where the therapist listens and then actually attends to your specific issues. The massage is as firm or gentle as you want & very comprehensive. My therapist gleaned that I spoke a little Thai, so we had a great little conversation as she went about the massage with her coaching me along with some of the words that I missed, lol. I could not lie down due to sinus congestion, so she was happy for me to sit up and do the massage kneeling on the bed behind me - very accommodating. Highly recommended!"

But it was one of the best massage I've had, especially for my office syndrome. Blind massager can feel and touch better. The overall experience was totally relaxing. I'll definitely come again."

I had many (also Thai) massages before and this was the worst I ever had.I stopped after a good hour with still 30 mins to go, because my massagist just didn't know what he was doing, almost fell asleep during the job and did not concentrate on my upper back as I had requested.I got almost one hour of leg thumb pressing and gently feet touching, before he even started on other parts.- the receptionist just said sorry and offered me 100 THB discount. A farce.I'm feeling not good to say this, but both guys moved around quite freely after the massage (before the massage they gave us the impression of being heavily visually impaired)I'm sorry and I don't know how to say this, but I went out with the feeling of being betrayed in multiple ways.The offer of coming back the next day or so, would have been nice. Still, my wife was very happy with her massage. So it was only half a disaster."

But the plus side is that you can book and then continue touring the beautiful Wat Pho as it is inside the complex. We chose the 30 min traditional full body Thai massage. This is no magic to your ailments but does a good job of getting you relaxed after a long holiday. The beds are not private, and you are kind of crammed between 2-3 other beds. Although this doesn't restrict you from getting a great massage. The only thing missing is the ambiance of a spa. The masseuse kept talking during the massage which was distracting.

We went to visit the Wat Pho (The temple of the Reclining Buddha) late in the day, so around 5.15 pm, we decided to get a massage. It was a bit difficult to find the Massage school, but it's all the way in the back inside the grounds of the temple. At that time, the wait was about 20 min. I think the last booking is at 6pm. My husband and I went as a couple, so we did the massage next to each other. We had the massage with the oil (the oil smells like Tiger balm, really good), and it cost ~600 BTH. This is a bargain if you live in the Western world, but it might be pricey compared to other Thai massage places outside. My husband had massages in Chiang Mai, Ko Samui, and at this massage school, and he said that it was far the best massage he got. It was deep massage, and well worth the money. My masseuse was a lady instructor at the school who has been massaging for 30 years and she gave me a deep massage, I felt amazing afterwards. My muscles were a bit sore next day, but in a good way. So, after reading other reviews, I think it depends on who you get. We were lucky to get masseurs that were experienced. I would definitely give it a try if I were there at the end of the day. The place was communal, but clean and the wait was not too long."

It cost 420 bhat (\u00a310) for an hour so compared to uk prices youre getting a bargain but compared to the street prices you may think they are expensive but its worth paying for a proffesional Will visit next time i am in Bangkok for sure!"

It was my place for exercise, especially when the temperature used to get a little cooler. You'll want to check if there are any events happening at the park. For instance, a lot can happen over Thailand's public holidays, and the park can take on a real festival atmosphere. The park also includes a number of standard events like Music in the Park that are worth looking out for. There's nothing nicer than spending an evening in lawn chairs listening to classical music, jazz or Thai music around the park venue. Generally speaking, Lumpini is a park like Central Park in New York. It is fully crafted and maintained. All the water features include fountains to oxygenate the water for the fish, birds and animals that inhabit the park. Keep a look out for the many large monitor lizards as well as birds, which flock to Lumpini Park as one of Bangkok's few locations that has a concentration of trees. Lumpini is also famous as a location for outdoor activities. There are free-to-enter exercise groups around the park, mostly after 5pm. Bangkok's fitness folk are always there jogging the track or taking advantage of the outdoor gym equipment. And of course at times of tension, Lumpini has also played host to protest groups on various sides of Thailand's political divides. In those cases, you may wish to steer clear. Suffice it to say though that there hasn't been any large-scale political demonstrations in Lumpini for a few years now."

I suggested we do something cultural while fulfilling our massage mission which could be done with a visit to Wat Pho. I remember coming here a decade ago and thinking it was well worth the lack of privacy and paying a bit more because of its ultra touristy location. This time was no different. We were one of the first to arrive and we kept our son busy with his iPad while my husband got a foot massage and I got a body one. My only regret was not going for a 1 or 1+ hour massage as this was hands down the best massage we got this visit."

I found the receptionists to be a little gruff, but all other staff were wonderful. I opted for a 1 hour Thai massage, no oil, soft pressure. I have read some adverse reviews here about the professionalism or experience of the masseur/masseuse, but I found my masseuse to be very good. And, you have to remember that these are students and you are getting a very good massage for at least 50% off the price on the street. There is also no privacy, but you are getting a massage with your clothes on so that is not a problem. So, with expectations set not to high, head into this with the idea that you are helping a student, saving money, and you're getting a good massage in an awesome environment and are experiencing something that most of your friends will never experience. I loved it. Besides, as I say, after touring the wonderful temples and buildings of Wat Pho the break from the heat is much appreciated. Make sure to put a visit to this school on your list."

You get a decent thai massage and for the last couple minutes they use a bag (which you can buy from the front desk if you want) that is moist and warm and rub it all over. Lots of lemon grass in it so you end up with a resin that dries on your skin, so make sure you have water to rinse off, but you'll smell great.I would stop by during your temple visits to get a relaxing time from the heat and crowds.

They give you a robe to change into and there is only one tiny 'changing room' made of curtains. The massage itself was very good and very different from the oily ayurvedic massages that I was used to at home.

We arrived at 10am and walked in with no line (vs the first day when we stopped in during the afternoon and the waiting area was packed). Definitely go early, 10am seemed perfect, but 11am might work too. Pricing was around US$15/hour. We each had a 1 hour foot massage and 1 hour total body massage. It was an amazing 2 hours. You are given lose knee length pants to change into when you arrive. You don\u2019t change your shirt. The massage is conducted clothed. I was a little nervous because friends of mine had said that Thai massages were painful, but not mine. Maybe they were just being gentle since we were western, but no pain at all. They gently twisted, pulled, stretched, and massaged just perfectly. I felt like a boneless chicken when I was done (in the best way possible). Getting the massage at Wat Pho was also part of the experience. I was able to look out the window during the massage at the beautiful ornate temples which capped off this excellent Thai experience perfectly. I would highly recommend this to a friend (in fact, I might move to Thailand just to get a massage here every week)."

The massage area is airconditioned. They have a queue system which seems chaotic but it still works. The staff is well trained and discreet. This was one of the best massages we had in Thailand though I wish it had been quieter. Great way to unwind and ease the fatigue after walking around the various temples and palaces in Bangkok."

It was as though she shaved 10 years of aging off my body. I have no idea what the name of my masseuse was. But if you are looking for the best Thai massage of your life, do go here!"

Upon reaching thr saw a small crowd waiting at the entrance apparently waiting to be served. Fortunately I don't hv to wait too long for my turn. The price is more expensive as compared to downtown cntrs. The much acclaimed treatment by most reviewers at the school I find it very mediocre.

You will be in incredible hands and feel blissfully rejuvenated after the experience. And although there can often be a wait (30 minutes to 1 hour), it's easy to kill time in a beautiful temple."

Historically, Thai massage was practiced at temples and one of Thailand's oldest massage universities is at the Wat Pho temple. The tradition and symbolism combined with the excellent technique made us glad we did not miss this treasure. It is located at the Wat Pho temple, so after visiting the reclining Buddha we had about a 20 minute wait after putting our names on the list for a 1 hour massage. It was a rigorous workover including stretching, pending and pressure points performed very professionally over your street clothes. It is a tranquil location, you will feel awesome afterward and it cost about $10 US! Tipping is not necessary but I felt guilty getting such a great massage for $10, so even a 25% tip did not seem like enough. A visit to Bangkok would not be complete without a massage at the Wat Pho Thai Massage School. You will be glad you took the time to experience the tradition at this location and probably want to go back again the next day!"

We each had a 60 minute full body massage. It was my first massage ever and I was worried about it being painful, but I told my masseuse \"first time\" and had no pain at all. It was very relaxing and rejuvenating. My husband had a different but equally positive experience. He has big muscles so I think his masseuse thought he was tough and pushed really hard with his whole body weight. He says it still was a great massage and he felt great afterward, but it wasn't relaxing. Do this massage. It's inexpensive and authentic."

You are massaged in an open room (many mattresses alongside each other), but this you will forget very quickly once the massage begins.

We also paid the entrance fee to get into the temple to reach the massage rooms.

Thai massage is very different from a Swedish massage. I ordered the foot massage and the body massage since it was really cheap. Thai massage is a lot of deep pressure with their thumbs, elbows and knees, for a second I thought we were wrestling on the mat. Overall, I felt like a wet noodle after I was worked over. I have really bad plantar fascia and the student was able to kneed out all the kinks in my hamstrings and calves. I can honestly say my foot pain was gone for several days. It is priced very cheap compared to receiving a massage at a resort. I definitely recommend coming here for a cheap and professional Thai massage."

As my main intention is to visit the mssg sch i spent only a few mins to tour the temple site before heading the school to hv a mssg. Whilst thr, thrs a small crowd waiting but I nd nt waited long whn they ask me to pay up. I pd TB260 for a 30min thai trad mssg. I shd say a bit more expensive thn hvg a mssg around downtown bkk tht cost only tb200 for 60min mssg. Its ok if the money goes to the school fund.They brought me to a hall whr they hv rows n rows of mssg bed n its thr tht i hd my mssg. While hvg the mssg the therapist was busy talking with the one beside me so thrs a lack of concentration when he performed the mssg. The mssg is nt as good as I expected. I can get a better mssg in Silom or the best thai traditional mssg tht i hv hd so far in \"yunomri onsen\" spa in sukhumvit.But however its a good experienced."

My masseuse massaged me from my body to my feet and then to my head without cleaning her hands after massaging my feet. That felt nasty to me and influenced how I felt about the whole massage.

My friend absolutely LOVED it (though she has more massage experience so she's probably used to it), but for me the pain made me a bit tense. Another important thing is the ambience. It's all in one room with about 30 people being massaged at the same time, so there's little to no privacy and it can be a bit loud (not a din, but when you're in a room with that many people, and people are going in and out, it's far from quiet).Overall, good for the experience of an authentic Thai massage, but wasn't superb."

My husband and I were in adjoining \"beds\" with a stranger to his other side. The massage was very relaxing and the massuse were deft in following their traditional methods. It is a bit similar to a deep tissue massage, but more aggressive and the massuse will use their feet, knees, and elbows to \"really get in there.\""

During my one hour massage, the masseur managed to find every tense point in my back and work systematically through them, in a way that was effective but not painful, and I felt great afterwards.Be aware that Thai massage works with pressure points, and is nothing like the gentle massage strokes that are more common in the West. It's absolutely worth trying, but also worth choosing well because a less expert back massage can make you feel worse than when you started. This establishment is a great choice for quality, convenience (you're likely to be visiting the temple anyway) and very reasonably priced."

When my number was called, I was taken into the hall next door full of clean, wide yellow beds, with a lovely medicinal scent. There was a safe place at the end of the bed for my ruck-sack, so no need to worry about belongings. This was the massage I've been looking for all my life! No messy oils, no getting half-naked, no rainforest music, no awkward conversations with the masseuse... on the contrary, you keep all your clothes on and are kneaded like dough by very firm hands that know EXACTLY what they're doing. The practitioners are terrifically strong (particularly their thumbs!), and the only sound in the room is the occasional gentle chatter between them as they get on with their routine. I had anticipated aching a little after visiting, but not at all. I felt transformed - rested, relaxed and fantastic, wishing I had had an hour instead of 30 minutes! As I left I was given a cold drink of water and a straw. If I lived in Bangkok I'd visit here frequently, and I'll definitely be looking for Thai massage places at home now that I've tried it."

All treatments are provided inside a large Sala (Buddhist pavillion) with bright red ceiling - but without any private rooms. There are just a few treatments to choose from, but all of them are authentic Wat Pho traditional massage with certified therapists. You will be given ticket number in case there are a lot of clients (I usually waited around ten minutes). My one hour foot massage costs 420.00 baht which is so reasonable. Try not to compare this place to the ambience you might get from a normal spa though. But, do cherish the therapeutic and relaxing experience that you'll get from this amazing Thais Wisdom. Don't miss it!!!"

My husband who never had a massage before even agreed to do it because it was affordable. We didn't make a reservation before hand and we waited just about 5 minutes to get in. The place was air conditioned and quiet. There are many other people in the room with you but they all want to relax just like you. I can't tell you how good my body felt after an hour long massage. Afterwards we didn't want to do much because we were both so relaxed. Definitely stop by this place if you have the chance."

It was a professionally run operation that is clean. The staff was also friendly and made our son and friend feel welcome and comfortable while my husband and I were treated to a massage.This is not your average, strip down, grease up, rub down that you see in the US. You are fully clothed. In fact I was given loose trousers to wear to protect my modesty while wearing a skirt. The therapist use deep pressure at vet specific pressure point. The best way I can describe it was pleasurable tension. They will go deeper or softer on request and seemed to respond to me without verbal communication. It is slightly uncomfortable for a moment, and when that pressure point is released it is incredible. If you have ever had ART for a sports injury it is a similar feeling. My husband and I had side by side massages and the two therapists were working almost in unison, moving along the body in a very specific and focused pattern. Both of us wished that we had allowed time for a full hour and I would have lived the opportunity for a foot massage, too.I enjoy an American massage, but this was far more refreshing. My husband generally doesn't like to be touched and only went along with the massage because I pulled, \"You came all this way and you may never have the chance to do this again.\"card on him. Even my grumpy, keep your grubby paws off of me husband enjoyed the experience."

After an amazing visit to pay respect to and be totally overwhelmed by the tantalising Reclining Buddha what could be more called for than an authentic Thai massage. Just a few minutes walk from the pavilion housing the Reclining Buddha you'll find the two other buildings where you can experience either a full body massage or just a foot massage. Along the way you'll notice several stone sculptures of figures representing various postures of Thai massage. These figures represent the teaching of Thai massage. Of the many massages that I experienced in Thailand, I would say that this is one of the best places to experience expert hands that are focused on solely massage. And the price is unbeatable. You may choose a half-hour or full hour session depending on your time (and budget). There can be a wait, usually not too long, so you might want to check in when you first enter the temple complex.Once again, expert hands and very affordable!"

For ladies wearing skirts, they have fisherman's pants for you to wear to cover up. Slightly more expensive than massage parlours on the street, but quality is great.Of course the question has always been, why would visitors get charged for visiting a temple.My take - just give it a shot, and if it is nothing special / you don't connect with it, then at least you wouldn't question \"what if\" :) Entrance fee is 100Baht, and you get a bottle of drinking water."

Just follow the signs inside Wat Pho and these will lead you to the building. We appreciated the air-conditioned massage pavilion, the orderly numbering system and the friendly staff. we decided to get a 1-hr Thai Body massage (420 baht) and a 30 min Foot massage (280 baht). Separate numbers were given for these services. We waited around 30 mins for our turn, which was no hardship since we were able to secure seats inside the pavilion, which was fully air-conditioned. When we were called for the body massage, they noted that we were also in line for the foot massage so they just instructed the masseuse to combine them, which was better and more efficient. There are around 10-14 beds available for the body massage and around 5 chairs for the foot massage. No, you do not have to be in your underwear for the body massage (which is a good thing because privacy is nonexistent). They just asked us to change our pants into a generic, one-size-fits-all loose trousers and led us to the beds. And proceeded to give us one of the best massages ever. EVER. when the 1 hour was done, we were seriously contemplating extending our time! they then led us to comfortable arm chairs, gave us sweetened water to drink and then got on with our foot massage. Wow. If feet can smile, ours would be grinning. It was just what we needed after a long day of walking. My masseuse even gave me blanket to use when she noted that i was shivering (yes, it was that cool inside - welcome break from Bangkok's humidity). Still, all good things must come to an end. We changed back into our street clothes, put our shoes back on and gave our masseuses big tips :)So, to anyone looking for a great Thai massage - this is the place to go. There is usually a long queue, and you will be told that it's a 40 minute wait. Please know that it is worth the wait and it usually doesn't take 40 minutes. I will definitely make it a point to come back!"

The Thai Massage here seemed like regular massages except they cracked my fingers and toes.. weird. The masseurs didn't seem very professional, they were taking calls and talking to each other a lot. But it's a nice escape from the heat when you've been walking around all day. Nothing special I would say. I paid 420 baht for 60 mins."

I would say plan for a day trip, start off with Wat Pho, get an hour massage (This way you can beat the crowd and it is not too hot) followed by short river cruise, Amulet market and if time is still left add in China town. Don't need a tour guide for this, you can get away with some basic Thai words. All of these attractions are with in walking distance. If you are familiar, you can ask people around. Thais are very friendly and likes to help foreigners. Beware of Pickpockets (which can be non-thai people). There are also some scammers around, but if you already plan your trip ahead of time, should be a really great day in Bangkok"

I would recommend minimally the 1 hour package....lie down and enjoy the massage..do be prepare for some spells of pain when vital points are pressed and knead...but after the massage, you will feel rejuvenated and refreshed.

I just felt that it was quite similar to what I have received at other massage centres in BKK and I was expecting for more. Furthermore, the location is rather far from the city, and you will have hard time looking for taxi drivers willing to on their meter due to the heavy jam during weekends. Pricing wise was still decent, approximately 420 baht for an hour (about the same as the massage centres in shopping malls). Due to the overwhelming number of customers, you may need to wait up till an hour for your turn. So during this time, you may take a walkabout in Wat Pho."

The massage is pricier than I expected - I got a 1/2 hr foot massage and 1/2 hr Thai massage for 540 baht (plus the 100 baht entrance fee to the Wat) - but it was wonderful. I received 2 foot massages and 3 Thai massages while in Thailand, and this was definitely my favorite foot massage and second favorite massage. Definitely worth a visit, though go early in the morning before they get booked up."

The deep tissue and pulling of limps is not for everyone. They work with the muscle to work out stress or pains. It does hurt so if you cannot handle a bit of pain or have a medical condition it is not for you.After the massage you are sore but you feel loose. The stress of the day is lifted. The next day you will feel amazing.Only problem is communication. English is not spoken to much or well. So if you wanted to ask them to stop or work on a certain area it can be tough.If you are part of a group, you can arrange with the local guide to have the massage in your hotel room. Of course the guide will have to let hotel security know.Overall it is so worth it and will do it again. Remember to tip!"

Had a Thai-style and foot press at the Wat in the morning, then a back and shoulder press, later in the evening at their school in Sukhumvit Soi 39.Its dearer at the Wat but you can't beat the atmosphere - nothing compares to being massaged within the compound of a magnificent temple. The massage itself was not bad.The massage at the school in town was more private as they have rooms and hence more restive in that sense. Cheaper and more comfortable. Your choice really - atmosphere or privacy. Both will leave you feeling really relaxed after. (But mind that it you're not used to oriental foot massages, it can be painful)"

The air con was not as cool as I would have liked it to be when I was learning Thai massage. I also found the teaching area to be a bit crowded but still reasonable.

The massage started abruptly. No questions asked about contraindications, or areas to focus on. After about 5 minutes the pressure was too much for me, and I told her it was too hard. She said yes it is deep, relax. I thought maybe it was lost in translation, so I asked a couple other ways, to lighten the pressure, less hard, but each time she just told me to \"relax\". I am a massage therapist, and I could feel my muscles tighten up all around where she was working. Completely the opposite of what I wanted!

After a short wait I was greeted by my -male- masseuse (they don't care too much about this unless you state it I think). The massage is done fully clothed and if you're wearing a skirt like I did, you'll get pants to cover up.The beds on which massages were performed were a little worn out, and it was busy in the room - don't expect any privacy.The massage itself was fascinating; for me it was very painful, but boy they do know to crack you in places you never thought it was possible! It's not suitable for those who want to relax, but if you've been walking around with an aching body and happen to find yourself at Wat Pho...consider it."

It's definately something different from all the other massages. My experience here is that the staff is well trained and very dedicated to do their work, whether you go for the foot massage, the 'regular' one or the herbal one. If you want to avoid waiting times, try to be there around closing time 4.30-5.00 pm or early in the morning (8.30-10.00)."

Probably the best straight forward massage I have ever had and would suggest it to anyone... Couldn't think of a better way to relax after sightseeing in the Wat Pho area...

OK, all reviews here are raving about the massage, so it's probably me who is getting this wrong, but I did not get as good a feeling as I had in sexy massages, something was missing...Just kidding!Just kidding, of course but, I am serious about not being totally convinced, maybe I was just unlucky but the young guy who massaged me (very professional) seemed at times to go through the motions.Lots of details were not taken care of, not a lot of pressure sometimes, I wasn't asked whether I had any pain points, I got a quick drink as I was walking out.The place was crammed with tourists, so it was not quiet, I felt it was a bit overrated.Certainly the location is great, right within the compound. Price was higher than elsewhere (520Baht for 1hr herbal). You get there rather sweaty and have no chance to recover, or was a bit, straight into the hands of the masseur..When I left I wasn't feeling that kind of relaxation feeling that I had after other massages.Would I go back? Yes, because it's so cheap I certainly would do it, but given a choice I'd rather to it in an airconditioned environment, with soft zen music, rather than screaming tourists, in a place where I am given a vest, some privacy and the ability to wash up before the massage, and ideally with an older masseur or masseuse, who is more likely to know what she is doing... sorry to go against the majority view here..."

My first of three trips to Thailand dates back to 2001 shortly after the 9/11 tragedy.I was one of a small number of Americans in Thailand as the continued terrorist threat loomed large. I stayed at a modest hotel called Vienthai in Bangkok. The location was ideal and I found myself walking everywhere. Shortly after midnight I found myself at a temple straining in the near pitch blackness of the night to see what turned out to be kids playing basketball. There must have been a school on the grounds with a basketball court because the sounds of pivoting sneakers and the dribbling of a ball were unmistakable, I now realized I had walked perhaps 12 hours or so since arriving at 4:30am the previous morning .The following morning I was beset with foot strain, remnants of travel fatigue and the shock of 9/11 wore on me.When asking the hotel concierge of sorts how I might spend the day considering my weary state, he suggested I take a Tuk-Tuk (three wheeled open air taxi) to Wat Phra Kao and Wat Pho temples. He explained of their tranquil surroundings being good for me and suggested I allow myself to experience a Healing Traditional Thai massage. What a great suggestion he made as that was my first foot massage experience. How many times I wish I could rewind the clock and find a Thai massage practitioner following many long hikes in the Sierra Nevadas of Northern California. I knew nothing of reflexology, pressure points, deep tissue work (therapeutic massage). Up until this point my healers were Orthopedic surgeons, chiropractors and traditional western M.D.\u2019s., massage and deep tissue therapy were completely foreign to me.My speedy recovery, renewed energy and unfailing feet for the remainder of my 3 week Thailand adventure I owe a debt of thanks to the youthful Thai massage practitioner who with great humility and respect treated me. On my 2nd and 3rd travel adventures to Thailand I never failed to seek out Thai masseuses/therapists especially those specializing in deep tissue work and feet massage. They were often found at the local day spa or the hotel. I went as often as time would allow given the active travel itinerary. It was becoming very apparent that massages were not a once in a lifetime luxury as they may be perceived here in the US , but rather a necessity for our maintaining optimum health. Now a decade later I find myself fortunate to have found an exceptional Therapeutic Thai massage therapist in Sedona, Arizona where I reside. The place is called Sedona Royal Thai Massage. Her total focus, attention and skill set have allowed me the greatest relief / recovery from both the myriad of sports related injuries I have suffered along with the spine, back, and neck repercussions from 4 serious car accidents in the Us spanning three plus decades. I never cease to be amazed that her work can erase the damage caused so years ago."

There was always at least 1 teacher per 4 students. Their english isn't brilliant for the most part, but it doesn't matter as what you're learning is very practical and tactile. When english was needed, there was always an english speaking teacher availalble. It is hard work, as you give massage about half the time you're there at least and that's 4hrs a day. One hour for lunch and then another 4 hours in the afternoon. The canteen is excellent, 40THB and everyone is also very friendly. You get rice, vegetables, meat, dessert,...I was sad to leave at the end of the course, and will return for part 2. Definitely worth attending, but only if you are genuinely interested in giving thai massage. Otherwise, like some people on my course, you will get bored very quickly."

            "review": "screen your teacher before enrollment. In January 2007 I traveled to Bangkok and enrolled in Wat Pho's massage school. Their website and all travel books stated the tuition was 7000BHT. When I arrived it had jumped to 8500BHT. They refused to honor the advertised price. I enrolled anyway. 30 hours of massage lesson - not bad (US$280) though huge by Thai standars. My instructor showed up 40 minutes late the first day, and then spent another 40 minutes talking about himself and his teaching history, but worst, I was told my class would be taught in English, but it was split 1/2 Thai, 1/2 English. So half the time was spent translating back and forth from one to the other. Questions were never translated unless I requested. I asked for a new class. I was told when I returned the next day I would have one (one day out of 5 lost). Next I was given a teacher that took cell phone calls, invited friends in from outside the class to work on them while he should have been teaching us, and finally, when I was giving this instructor a massage he fell asleep! On the last day, he noticed I was having pain in my lower back. He offered to correct it, and yanked on me in a way that actually slipped a disk in my back. I have had 4 chiropractic sessions since returning to the US and it is still not healed. Finally, at my final test, I was quite embarassed because the reviewer kept correcting me and told me I should know these simple steps (I didnt becasue my teacher never told me). I filed a complaint with the dean, but he was so nervous he escorted me out of his office and gave me to a student for a free massage. For a slipped disk?I do know however, that the teacher next to me was excellent and actually advised me as much as my own. So, pick and choose wisely. Its my honest belief they got in guidebooks, are making alot of money, and living off past reviews. Their big price jump and unwillingness to act on my behalf tells me loud and clear it is more about money than student learning at this point. I would look elsewhere or at least get in writing absolutely everything before you start. Perhaps observe your teacher teaching prior if possible. Mine was a 45+ yr old man with a large face mole. Do pass on him."

The massage school is very popular and you may have to wait 20-30mins, depending on the time of day. The students have amazing energy - massaging like crazy all day. It's not a private experience, and is rather energetic, completely different to a Swedish massage, for example, but not as painful as some remedial massages I have had. They make your body do things you didn't think possible - the most memorable point for me was definitely hearing every vertabra crack one by one! Afterwards you are rewarded with a cold drink. Apart from the standard Thai massage, foot massages are also available."

I have had reasonably good massages there, however it is just a matter of chance that you are allocated to an experienced masseuse or not. Of late, the place has become too commercial, catering to group of tourists from Asia, who are herded by tour operators. The waiting period is long and the procedure for booking is cumbersome. If you are waiting in the lobby, you have to be lucky to be served some water by the scores of staff who are wandering around without much purpose. Overall the place gives you an impression that you are not welcome or rather the onus is on you to get the superlative service....My last visit was the worst experience ever in Thailand. The masseuse was a lady in 50's, quiet healthy that she couldn't sit properly on the floor beside the mattress for doing the massage. She was disinterested from the beginning and was doing a very soft massage, rather was using her knees to just push instead of a proper Thai massage. She started telling that business had been poor in the current situation, hinting towards good tips. After 10minutes she started doing the massage with single hand and kept on scratching her shoulder with her other hand. Then she opened some sachet and poured the contents to her mouth and started chewing. After about 45 minutes she seemed tired and asked me if she can watch television while massaging. At this point, I requested her to stop the massage and said that I would leave. On the way back, I conveyed my displeasure as a complaint to one of the ladies in the uniform at the reception. The response was a 'sorry' and she wrote my name on a pocket book. When one is willing to pay more than the usual rates in Bangkok for a clean space and a massage from an expert, why take a chance at a tourist trap !"

When my name was called, I walked downstairs and was accompanied by my massage therapist, she was around 40-50 years old I think. She took my shoes & gave me new slippers. We went inside the elevator, and was brought up to a private room with a sliding door. I was told to change clothes & then she started the massage. I had 2-hour Thai massage that time. The therapist was really good and experienced. My bones were cracking but in a good way haha. She always ask me if the pressure was okay. I changed clothes after the massage, then she told me to tip her. I was satisfied so I gave her 100ThB. Then we went to the elevator again and went downstairs. She then gave me a tea to drink & returned my shoes."

Apparently he is there to push customers to commit to something, even if it means offering misleading information, then changing the topic of discussion to choosing one of two options he provides. He only wanted to talk about two different massages with two different wait times for just those two massages, \"25 minutes or one hour wait.\" We told him we wanted deep tissue. Then we further explained we wanted more pressure. We choose his recommended massage with a 25 minute wait; it was at most reflexology, very light touch; I'm still knotted up . His English speaking ability is good, why not use this skill to actually consult, not lie and push? He was just as pushy on day one. He's not there to help you select what's good for you. We felt like he's there to keep the lines moving."

I've had quite a few Thai massages in my day and I know they tend to follow a specific pattern. I also layed flat through most of the massage and wasn't really twisted or put into any unsual positions to get those knots out.Further, I noticed that the massage started at 6pm by my phone and finished at 8pm by the clock in my room. By when I got changed and got escorted back downstairs - it was only 7.45pm by my watch - meaning I lost at least 20 minutes of massage time. The ladies are also very expectant of tips - she kept looking at me until I handed some notes to her and she then proceeded to count them - with no decorum. Further, one lady I shared a lift with proceeded to squeeze her spots using the lift mirror - disgusting. They should really learn about customer service."

However, one can be assured of the cleanliness, reliability and quality of the massage here. Do remember to call in or get your hotel staff to call in to book a slot before heading down, as it can get very busy and walk-ins may not be guaranteed a slot. There are many rooms and multiple storeys available. You can request for a twin room if going with your partner or just have 2 of you. A regular thai massage is about 500 bhat for 2 hours. Other options such as aroma therapy or facial or herbal body spa are available but much more expensive. Most people opt for thai massage (full body) or foot massage here. Getting here is easy, best way to get here would be by taxi/uber from your hotel, or you can also walk from Asoke station, about 5-10 min walk."

            "review": "Good atmosphere but massage can be a bit painful. We visited Health Land in Asok after reading good reviews online. We opted for the foot massage (1h) which cost 350 THB each. We did not book in advance and just turned up in the late afternoon and only had to wait 10mins. The reason behind the short wait is because its a pretty big place with many masseuses employed there. You might need to book in advance for body massage. We were led to a darkened and quiet room which gave off a relaxing vibe. We all had a good experience on the whole, but two of us found the massage a little more painful, I guess it depends on the masseuse. I told my masseuse to go a bit more soft and she replied \"soft soft\" and after this the experience was much better, with a good amount of firmness and only a little pain. The foot massage included feet, hands, arms and shoulders. They do crack your fingers and toes but it wasn't painful. They do put a lot of pressure on the shoulders which I found painful so I asked her to go a bit softer. Overall it was a relaxing experience and they gave us tea afterwards. The only bad thing was that the masseuse asked quite assertively for tips afterwards."

You can experience very good massages practically everywhere in Thailand but most of the time it is, as we say in our idiom, \"You and your luck! \". My first concern in massage parlours is cleanliness, followed equally by professionalism and honesty. In addition to offering a very decent and spotless environment and being very reasonable when it comes to tariffs (unlike silly priced so-called \"luxury\" spas) , appointments are always respected (never was the victim of any mistake in the past ten years), masseuses (as a man, I prefer ladies for thai massage) are considerate, gentle and accomodating: I agree that they are not all up to the same professional standard and the management should really be more selective. Very difficult if not impossible to secure the same masseuse for a next session (why is it so?). But, unless you are living in Thailand and have your next door parlour with a particular practitioner you are used to and who knows exactly how to deal with your specific requirement (if any) Healthland (Asok, Ekamai, Sathorn etc... and elsewhere in the country) is your safest and best bet. If (like me) you are a regular visitor to Thailand and prefer the original 2-hours thai massage, best in the world, I advise you to buy the 10 coupons booklet (valid one year) which offers a sensible reduction on the normal fare."

After 8 years coming to this place, unfortunately it was my last time here. I tried to explain to the lady that Thai massage it is not supposed to be rubbing, she was supposed to do acupressure. She did not understand or did not want to change. She was using the elbow in areas which was not supposed to. All my friends kept telling me since long time that this brunch is the worst and it does not care about the customers, but i did not want to listen.

So I show her the receipt then go back to the waiting area. Nothing happens so I go to reception again and they start discussing something, our appointment was somehow put down for 7pm at which point I said I clearly stated 7.30 over the phone then she says we can take the more expensive Thai massage. I was expecting some kind of courtesy discount for their absolute mess of a service but got none so we just got the refund and left. Terrible."

This outlet takes the fact that they are reputable for massage services n they can compromise of service timeliness. Sorry to say that time is money to everyone.

Now, having said that, yesterday I finally had the chance to visit a well known massage institution here in Bangkok; Health Land Health Spa. Head and shoulders (pun intended) above the \"average\" spa experience here. You pay a premium for this, but well worth it. I had the aromatherapy body massage at 950 baht ( $27) for 90 minutes. Though it was more than 3 times what I usually pay, but it was 3 times a better spa experience. Well worth. I think they pick the best of the best massage therapists in Thailand for their staff. If you ever happen to be in Bangkok for one reason or another, you must stop here for a complete relaxing experience. Check the web site for all services and prices.

The lady who worked on me did about an hour on my feet, another half hour on my legs, and then another half hour on my neck, shoulders, arms, and scalp. The only reason I wouldn't rate this place 5 stars is that the room you're taken to for foot massages doesn't have the nicest ambience, but this is a minor point. Overall I'd highly recommend it."

The young masseuse did not manage to get my kinks out of the spots that I wanted and I could feel alot of elbows rather than kneading.For $550 baht for a 2 hr thai massage, I find it reasonable. The place is clean and the ac is cold in the massage room. Recommended to make an appointment before going down as it can get really busy and the wait could be long.

For the past 3 years, the quality of massage and service has been from bad to very bad to absolutely terrible! Each time I came over the past 3 years, I kept thinking maybe I got a bad masseur. But after 3 years of bad experiences, it pretty much confirms the extremely bad value for money we get from this place. The Thai massage my husband and I got last night was totally lousy. I finished the 2-hour massage with a bad stiff neck. During the 2 hours, the masseur was definitely not giving me a Thai massage and I believe she has no idea what she was doing. Nothing she did resembled any Thai massage. Zero technique applied, just random use of elbows and rubbing here and there. And each time she thinks I fell asleep, she will actually stop massaging and was just chatting away with her colleague. When my husband fell asleep, his masseur actually left the room during the 2-hour massage (in the middle of the massage) and let him sleep while she disappeared for a good 10 mins. What a rip-off! We thought \"Ok, maybe the Thai massage is bad so let's try the foot massage.\" Well, today's foot massage was even worse. It felt like they spent an hour slowly applying oil on my legs and feet. I would not call it a massage at all. A total waste of time and money.We bought the vouchers 8 mths ago and decided to burn the value of the last two vouchers cause it is a waste of time to come back to Health Land ever again. Used to be good many years ago but now a tourist trap. That's why you won't see any Thais coming in here now. Not to mention the reception people are really rude!Pay a little more and try other spas in Bangkok. You will definitely get better value for your money. This place is a rip-off for unsuspecting tourist who just don't know better."

The lobby is FULL of people waiting to for their names to be called. We waited for about 20mins (we were quoted 30 mins wait) before our names were called over the PA system. I Guess to make it more efficient, that's the best way. But it kills the spa mood cos I felt like I'm in an airport. We were then brought to change our footwear and brought up to our room where we changed out into the attired given. The Therapists came and started massaging. It did bother me in the beginning cos they were talking between themselves but I fell asleep soon after. I did notice the sliding door was not fully closed throughout the massage so I do hear the movements along the corridor. I had the traditional Thai massage and Hot compress treatment. While the massage was good, the Hot compress treatment differs from the one I tried in Indonesia. The therapist did pound the compress on my body at first, after which she rubbed it against my skin like a scrub. I'm not sure if that's the way to do it but whatever. "

This was the my 1st time at Healthland (Asoke) & I would like to share a very terrible & horrified experience I had when I booked (in advance) for a 1.5hours aroma massage on Sat 23 Apr at 5pm. I had to wait for another 30mins before I was being led to a room to begin my massage. Once I started my massage (facedown), I felt clawing & scratching on my back & down my legs. My heart went ok, this would be 1 of the poor massages that I had experienced before (in other places) so I might as well take a nap & get done with. But it did not end there, I felt something warm & wet sprinkling down my back, legs & body thru-out the massage even though the lady had both hands on my body the entire time. I felt uncomfortable & would lift my head to see what was going on, but everytime I lifted my head up, the therapist would stop thus I was unable to catch anything. I suspected that she spitted at me because I could smell saliva on me but I gave her the benefit of doubt.I was getting terrified & I wanted to see what she was really doing to me so I started to compare as she did my right leg first then to my left. That's when I stopped the whole massage & send her away & also got her to send someone from the front desk or manager up to my room. I wrapped myself with a towel & did not shower as I wanted to show the evidence (not much aroma oil on my body & scratches, because if there's more oil than saliva maybe the scratches on my back will be minimal) to someone in charge. 1 guest relation in charge came up & I told her what had happened, then she went & got another guest relation (Joy) together with the masseur into the room. I explained the whole situation to them & they told me they would refund me the baht$950 which I had paid. I was very upset because its not about the $$, because my back had scratch marks (raw) & saliva which meant I might get any diseases from the masseur. But they explained that there was no complaint from other customers about her & she had 4 years of experience & if she did not know how to do proper massage, she would not have passed the test. I told them maybe the masseur was feeling very stressed or had any mental health issues that we were not aware of or other unknown reasons. (No disputes or unkind remarks exchanged between me & the masseur prior) The masseur even showed us her short fingernails & told me she could not have made the scratches on my body & maybe she's suffering from cold & cough thus her fluids dripped onto my body (if that's the case, she was too near for comfort) but what I felt was not normal sneezing or coughing but her blowing her saliva onto my body the entire massage which I had with her.The guest relations brought up some medication for my scratches (alcohol) after I took a shower & they apologised & refunded me. Now that I am back in Singapore, I called up my doc as I am very scared that the masseur might pass any diseases to me & was informed that an accurate medical report can only be done 2-3 months. I have 2 kids & expressing my breastmilk too because of this incident which there was not any disputes or misunderstandings prior the massage session now I am unable to provide my breastmilk to my child, I am avoiding close contacts with my family members as I am not sure of anything yet. I pray hard that the masseur did not borne any ill intentions to me, both myself & her will be ok. To summarize my experience with Health Land Asoke on 23 Apr'16 :Service : poor & not very helpful guest relation (especially Joy because of her attitude, not sure if its because of the language barrier) Price : Not worthMassage skills : TerribleExperience : Horrified"

YES, the place can have a little bit of the \u201cfastfood chain\u201d feelings but rest assured that as soon as your therapist has taken you to the massage room, all is very relaxed, clean and the massage are very well and professionally performed.Only downside might be the fact the most of the therapist don\u2019t look very open and happy at first sight. Most of them a little distant as well. Majority does not speak English very well.After a few massage we were asked if we would not like to have a specific therapist. We both mentioned one for the next appointment and this seemed arranged. But upon arrival we both we advised the therapist was not there!!!! This was kind of odd and disappointing. What\u2019s the use of asking and booking a specific therapist if, at the requested time and date, they are not available?"

The lady was very thorough & I felt great and ready for the day ahead. 2 nice cups of tea aswell after each session. I went at 9.30am and there were only a few of us there.

It was a one-hour therapeutic massage for 350 baht. The therapist used mostly Thai massage techniques, and I was very happy with the experience. She was very focused in her work, and she applied just the right amount of pressure. The next day I came back for a two-hour Thai massage. The massage therapist was horrible -- gruff, abrupt, kept mumbling things to me in broken English and when I would respond in English she would tell me that she doesn't speak English. Why then did she keep mumbling in English the whole time? The experience was not relaxing. I felt as if she did not know what she was doing or did not care. In fact, it was clear within the first few minutes I was not going to like it. I should have walked back to the front desk to demand a different therapist, but I didn't. That is my regret. At 550 baht (~$15), it's not about the money but the time/opportunity cost. I could have had a much better massage in half the time (in fact I did the previous day).Healthland is the fast food version of a massage parlor. They literally serve dozens of customers at a time, so they have dozens of therapists, who clearly have varying degrees of interest and work quality. Because of the uneven quality I can't recommend Healthland."

My first massage was average, maybe it was the end of the day and the masseuse was tired. For my second massage, I was close to crying as the masseuse knitted out the stubborn knots in my shoulder and back. I believe she got out my decade old knots. It hurt but I felt lighter for several days after.I was not overtly asked to tip, but I think tipping is expected. And really,for the price you pay for a private room and the massage, it is not much to ask.The Asoke branch is easily located. Alight at Asoke BTS station. Look for directions to the Terminal 21 shopping mall. Walk alongside left of the mall, cross a small lane and you will find Health Land which occupies an entire building,"

After I finish foot massage, I did Thai massage with an old auntie and it's really worth! 550 for 2 hrs. I feel relax until fell asleep. People will think Thai massage will be pain, but it's not! Just only some part they've to bend your back only and it's not too pain. However, Thai massage is a must to try coz after finish I feel more relax than foot massage. After you finish massage they'll for you (to tip) at the left side. Normal rate for TIP massager is 40-100 baht. If you give 20 baht or never tip, they'll look at you with angry face."

Half of us did aromatherapy body massage while my dad did 2hr Thai body massage and my mom and youngest sister did foot massage. The massage was really good as I'm someone who really enjoys Swedish, Balinese style massage. For those who like deep tissue massage, please give this a miss as you will think the masseuse lacks strength but that's how the style works. I absolutely enjoyed the 90min massage.What happened after, made the experience extremely unpleasant. At the end of the massage, the masseuse said, \"tip tip, 100 baht\". And before she walked out of the room, again she said \"tip, tip 100 baht\". Firstly, I think tips should not be made mandatory and I think it is almost rude to demand for a certain amount of tip. As I walked out, again she said \"tip, tip 100 baht.\". I was ready to give a 40-60 baht tip but to have her constantly demand for a 100 baht tip made me extremely unwilling to give her any tip at all. At the start of the massage, my masseuse asked me if it was my first time at Health Land Spa and perhaps this was why she thought I could be taken advantage of.At this point, I was pretty turned off but as it's my first time there I thought perhaps that's standard practice so I decided to check with my sister. I was all changed and walking towards my sis when I saw her passing her masseuse tip only to have her masseuse say \"no good\" to her tip (claiming that it is insufficient) and insisted that she needs to give 100 baht. Now, that is just plain rude. Who rejects a tip? I told my sister not to give any tip, and for me to clarify with the Guest Relations Manager. If they say that tipping of 100 baht is mandatory, I will be more than happy to give 100 baht. In a place where massage costs 190 baht onwards, I think it is very unbecoming of their staff to demand for a tip of 100 baht. I spoke to two Guest Relations Managers who assured me that this was not standard practice and they were very apologetic. They also highlighted that they will speak to their staff. All in all, good massage but due to the way it ended, it left a very distasteful feeling for me. Word of precaution: If your masseuse demands for a 100 baht tip, know that you have the prerogative to give a tip of any amount you deem fit."

You may need to book in advance as even though i was able to be seen straight away on the first 2 days i showed up at my leisure, they were fully booked (accept for a 8pm) on the 3rd day when i was trying to make a booking time on day 2. I couldn't make that time and so went to \"The Touch\" instead which is another excellent place close by with the same prices for traditional massages.Healthlands has some pretty hefty prices for the packages though the treatments are a bargain.There are plenty of good places doing traditional massages at 300B for 1hour, 550B for 2 hours though i haven't seen a place which offers such good value for the Therapeutic massage which is 350B for the hour. I had a 1 hour session the first day and then went back for a 2 hour session the next. I found it to be most like a physio session and so a fantastic place to go to if you have a bad back or other body aches.I was worried the woman would get too tired for the 2 hour session but she never came close to slowing down. I just told them the area's of my body i would like them to focus on and they got to work. As most physio sessions in Australia are only 30 minutes, having someone work on your pain points for 1-2 hours gives you a much better outcome. If you don't care about having your feet, legs, hands arms and head massaged, but want your back rejuvenated, the Therapeutic massage is the one to get and this is the place to get it!Thanks Healthland"

This time I tried Abhyang Ayurvedic massage, a lady with No. 333 was just extraordinary and the whole experience was simply great. I would highly recommend to everyone to visit Health Land whenever you are in Bangkok."

Having visited Bangkok for three days in early December it was well worth a visit to Health Land in Asoke, wherein I had a traditional Thai, massage for two hours at 500 Baht it was money well spent. I would definitely visit Health Land and recommend it for its 5 star service offered throughout your visit with exceptionally professional staff and the massages are first class, a highlight of my time in not only Bangkok but also Thailand"

As soon as the massage was finished, the masseuse told us \"give us tip ah..\". I planned to give them some tip anyway, but for them to ask for it upfront actually raised our eyebrows. So after changing our cloth, we gave THB 50 each, only to be surprised that they asked for THB 100 tip each. All 4 of us (separately) got the same request. This part really ruined the overall experience. And apparently I saw many other reviews that share similar concern."

From the very first step in the door, you'll get the idea. Health Land is a large chain operation that houses outlets in several places in Bangkok, as well as Pattaya. It shows. While the facility is very neat and clean, it's also very impersonal. I felt like I was on an assembly line. We each had a two hour traditional massage (500 baht). The massage therapists were decent, but we've had much better. Payment is made in advance, which is a little unusual. Tipping is not only expected, it's demanded, which is amazingly unusual. All in all, it's not an experience we'll be repeating. Bangkok has plenty of \"mom and pop\" massages places that give much more attentive service at the same or lower prices. Go to those instead of the Wal Mart of Thai massage.By the way, if the locals come here, they must come by way of tourist shuttles, because we saw a lot in the parking area."

You can easily check their website for their menu and locations nearest to you. I feel like it's 10 Times better than the walk in places on the street. If you want serious massage do check out this school. I've heard that the Asoke location can get rather crowded, but since I'm in a hotel a only 2 blocks away I have concierge make me a reservation as soon as I wake. Usually only 2 or 3 hours in advance. 2 hour Thai massage was only 500 baht and it was GREAT, so I went back the next week and discovered a girl that I wanted to keep so I took her #349 (Thai names are hard to remember but hers is Narin. The 2nd time I went I could barely make it there my back hurt so bad. I was in serious pain and stiffness. The Thai massage is a regular routine but this girl Narin #349 addressed the problem I was having and then got back to the routine of course. I really appreciated that, because I was in such bad shape that she really had to work hard, and that she did. I tipped her well and asked for her the following week. She was happy to see me again. This time I chose the Thail HERBAL massage ( 800 baht ) which was one hour of massage and then one hour of hot herbal sachet stuffed with Thai herbs and steamed in a crock pot steamer, being carefully rubbed all over my aching joints and muscles. I wasn't expecting it to be \"all that\" and my skin is very sensitive to hot rocks so I was a bit afraid of to much heat, but IT WAS GREAT, and again SHE WAS GREAT. I really needed it as this week my legs were in bad shape. I will be doing it again next week. The place is very clean, very zen, pleasant and professional. The Thai herbs smell strong as soon as you get to that floor, but I'm very used to that smell as I use herbs frequently. I \"loved\" it. It's not a stinky smell just very earthy. They have about 8 floors I think and enough students to handle a daily flow of traffic. They also have a shop where they sell lotions, soaps, spa goods, etc. I was so happy I found this place and was about to try a different massage girl but as long as I go to this location I will stay faithful to Narin. She walked on my back and other parts of my body using her entire body weight to work stamp out my knots. And she was not a small Thai girl but at least 140 lbs. I can't wait to go again next Wednesday."

When I arrived on a Saturday it was busy but not too much so. A friendly lady helped me choose a 90 minute Ayurveda massage for 1500 Baht (by far the most expensive massage I had so far in South east Asia) from a menu on a board. Only afterwards when checking out reviews on TripAdvisor I found out that there are other massages that are cheaper (950 Baht for a 90 minute oil massage). When I inquired after my (very average) massage and found a leaflet showing the other massages they told me they are not available right now. An obvious lie, the lady saying that actually looked uncomfortable having to say that. I think that's so poor and really sad. I can't believe the place is so busy. If you still want to go I would recommend checking out their menu and prices online beforehand and insist on the chosen option. Then you can have a nice experience - the place looks nice enough, very large, clean with nice rooms. Just don't expect your masseuse to speak any english and to be treated with respect as a foreigner and not an ATM."

I shall start on the good points first. Looking at others' reviews, we were pretty lucky as we managed to book for a slot an hour before our appointment. Even though it seems like they lost our booking details, they still managed to slot us in and probably there were not many guests that day, we didn't wait long for our turn. The air con does make some noises now and then but not really bother me. Upon hearing me sniffing, 1 masseuse adjusted the air con temp and another took tissue for me, which impressed me. It was a small action but they could have just ignored me. The massage was indeed less than 2 hours, but maybe about 1 hr 50 mins? To me, I'm okay about it. However, the massage was a disappointment. Of all massages I have gone before, this has to be the worst in my opinion. It may not necessarily be a bad massage, but it was painful. I think our masseuses had either too much strength or they are testing our tolerance level. Even after I told my masseuse it was painful at one point, I'm not sure if she understood me because all she said was \"too hard\" -.- Even so, she still used a lot strength. She kept mentioning to me that my thigh is too hard, my shoulders are \"too hard\". But the way she mentioned wasn't just like commenting or what because she mentioned like at least 5 times!? Pretty annoyed at this point. And it sounded more like a complaint to me. So if you exercise often, and have stiff shoulders, don't come here and risk getting this masseuse. And she used so much strength that I left with painful calves. Not even funny The massage was not relaxing at all.We have concluded that it is most likely our first and last trip to Health Land. I have gone to smaller places with cheaper prices and left much more satisfied than here. Health Land is too over rated."

I had a 2 hour Thai massage but it was definitely not a \"Thai massage\" most of the time the lady was kneading with her hands and fingers, absolutely nothing to do with some authentic Thai massage that I experienced before. It was more like a friend who watched some massage tutorial on YouTube and gave me a massage which I would appreciate but definitely not professional. My mum had a aromatic oil massage and she had a better experience. So I guess it's by luck whether you get a good therapist or not."

Arrive on time, head to counter to pay, the female manager with the help of the cashier presents me with a bill of 1500 baht. Having been to Ekkamai Healthland before (which I think is a great place by the way and ran very professionally) I recognize the price for an oil massage is 950 baht, NOT 1500. I ask the staff about this and they explain the extra charge is for an expensive specific type of oil I ordered while booking the massage - I NEVER DID SUCH THING. They, specifically the young-ish lady manager standing on front of the reception greeting guests, tried to blatantly scam me 550 baht hoping I was a tourist who wouldnt notice the difference in the price. No apologies, no discounts offered to make up for their error - absolutely abysmal customer service. BEWARE!I was extremely unhappy at this point but figured Ill just get a massage since Im already here. After that, unfortunately Healthland Asoke keeps disappointing. After waiting 20 minutes, a staff comes and says \"10 minutes more, we are having some problems\"- never specified what kind of problems. My turn is finally called after 50 minutes (!!!) of waiting - I have never seen this in any of the high-end spas in Bangkok before. An absolute disgrace for customer service I would not recommend for anyone.Also, the rooms were built of granite or another material that made them extremely uncomfortably cold. I was freezing after taking a shower, NOT a nice experience. At the front desk there was an Asian lady in the counter complaining loudly how she had spent an hour waiting in a towel - apparently her therapist never arrived and nobody ever came to inform her about it! Seems like I wasnt the only one having issues with their terrible service.Absolute disgrace to customer service, stay away."

The treatment room was somewhat worn our, gaps in the wooden laminate floor, the massage bed was oily. The masseuse was a little rough, for example threw and pulled the towel instead of gently laying it on and lifting it from the body; both masseuse were talking between themselves and did not bother to whisper, the aircon was very noisy and blowing strong wind, but was switched off upon request. Towards the end, when we were the last guests, the masseuse opened the door and left it open while we were still having our massage. Since the music had stopped (probably centrally controlled), we could hear the cleaners chatting and the lift door opening and closing.The massage itself was OK-ish, nothing special.We had much better massages in BKK and would not come back."

For the price I paid, I expected much better masseurs, better trained as well to alleviate my back pain, although I have to admit the surroundings and ambience were very nice.I would not recommend this place to anyone unless they are the picky kind that wants a clean, luxurious spa-like experience. Even so, you could probably get the same treatment at your own hotel spa without having to travel out.I had much better massages for THB200 at the many shops that can be found all around Bangkok, if you are not fussy about the ambience and the iffy chairs and cushions.

I made my reservation 2 days in advance for a thai massage / 2 hours (me and my boyfriend) and it was confirmed for 7:30pm.From the outside, the venue is quite imponent and once you enter inside the ambiance matches a spa environment (it was a weekday though). We paid in advance and we had to wait in the main room until our names got called. Then, two ladies escorted us to another floor where our massage room was. It was clean and we had to put on their massage clothes. We only started the massage at 8:00pm and throughout its duration the two ladies didn't stop chitchatting (luckily it was in thai, unknown language for us, otherwise we would have hate it!). For our surprise the massage was finished by 9:30pm! Hence, at the end, the masseusses (or should I say \"random and clueless old ladies lacking experience\"?) begged for tipping - especifically asking for 100thb and not giving us the chance to judge and offer what we thought was correct based on the service. We actually ended up not having any change (only 500 and 100thb) and the ladies started complaining and got mad! We had to apologize for not having any change - ridiculous! Never in my life I experienced something like this, especially working in tourism / hospitality as well for years.When the ladies escorted us on the way to the main room, they completely changed their attitude with us, by being rude. I specifically asked to speak to the manager to let them know about the inccident (the fact that we paid for a 2 hours massage and got 1h30 each, not even mentioning the rest - tips, attitude, professionalism, etc). The spa guest relations came and apologize, referring that the staff would be punished for that and that they were sorry again. I told them that I didn't want the staff to be punished but instead to be compensated in some way with either a price discount or even more time for free (yes, I gave them the chance to come back!). Their only answer was that they would accept my reservation for a foot massage next time since they normally don't accept them. Incredible - thank you so much for the kindness - not! We just left angry and in the next day, as a test, I called them to check if they had time to process and if they were going to compensated us in any way. Not surprisingly, they had no clue of the process, no one answer properly and they just said again \"sorry mam, sorry mam\".Actually, I tried to write this review asap in order to share my bad experience, avoiding that others step into this place! On a side note, I tried other massage places in the area and they were all good /more authentic and slightly cheaper."

Since most customers are foreign, the staff didn\u2019t realise I was Thai and, when I pulled a 100-baht bill out of my pocket in the lift, joked about getting the \u201cred-coloured bank.\u201d Similarly I heard from one Japanese client that his masseuse complaint after giving her 50 baht. Yet, given its convenient urban locations, Health Land\u2019s treatments and packages still offer good value for money. For example, 120-min Thai massage costs only 500 baht (free for SCB First credit card holders). If you prefer the peace and quiet, try to visit on weekday morning. On Saturday/Sunday the atmosphere is as hectic as public hospitals\u2019. Even if you've made a reservation, you may be kept waiting for up to 20 minutes.

They both were run of the mill, off the street older ladies with no actual idea of what they were doing except rubbing your feet, lower legs and knee area. It was done in a huge room with 30+ reclining chairs and most were full, thus very noisy. We also had a customer who was sleeping and snoring so loudly it was disturbing. I think he had sleep apnea. After 45 minutes of rubbing and no pressure points touched in our feet, they both left and we sat for 3-5 minutes wondering what was going on and if the massage was over. When they returned, the foot reflexology became an arm and shoulder shove, moving into a seated on a stool shoulder massage(digging elbows into our necks and backs) and in no way relaxing... My BF said, he was happy the torture was over in the end... We are both seasoned travelers and have had many massages through out the world, I have even gone through a Thai massage course and this might have been the worst massage we have experienced.

I would definitely recommend booking an appointment as this place gets pretty pack, normal wait time would be between 1-2 hours. I would also opt out of the facial unless you face is dry or sunburn like mines, as their facial is more geared toward applying products toward your face."

Though you can easily walk in at any time and get a treatment without speaking Thai as the staff seemed to have some level of English and the spa menu is in EnglishWe opted for the 2 hour Thai massage for 500 Baht. Absolutely divine! You are given a set of clothes - fishermans pants and top to wear for the massage (no oil is used - just pressure/massage). The two hours flew by and before we knew it were done. Highly recommend to anyone travelling to Bangkok."

Healthland Asoke is about 5 mins walk from Asoke BTS Station if you walk on the small lane between Westin and Terminal 21. Easy access to BTS makes it popular and busy even on weekdays. Went on Monday afternoon and it was crowded but not cramped as they have a large waiting area at the reception. Tried both the traditional massage and Ayurvedic treatments. A 1-hour therapeutic massage costs THB 350. The massage is firm and pressure is good. This is one of the better Thai massage I had in Bangkok, I would go back again for the traditional thai massage. However, the Shirodara (Indian Head Massage) which costs THB 2,000 is a waste of time and money. The head massage was just mediocre and the warm oil dripping on the forehead is not exactly soothing. Would give this a miss.Didn't have any issue with masseur harrasing me for tips as both masseurs left me alone after serving tea. Would recommend Healthland if you are looking for quality massage at a reasonable price in a clean environment."

After we ended our massage n the staff were standing there to wait for tips. To us, tips are given at our willingness. But they standing there n asking us to give them the tip & still unhappy with the tips amount we have. Most terrible is when my hb n mother were completed the treatment at the same time, my hb did not have small notes n gave a 100baht note to share among 2 & then walk out. The most unpleasant feeling is they still chase out n asking extra 1 more tips n said that we must give 1 more tips because they are 2 people. We are really dissapointed with their massage quality n also tips demanding attitude. They provided poor massage service n quality n asking more tips. No doubt the massage price at this centre is cheaper than lot of huge massage centre. But with this kind of quality n demanding tips staff, I rather choose to pay more to go other massage centre."

You are largely paying for the very clean surrounds, linen & little extra touches. The massage was good (my fourth & my last). I have tried this place a few times as I keep hearing good reviews. I would add that the air conditioner was dripping on me for most of the massage, which was unhygienic & annoying.At the end of my massage ( twin room with my wife) I thanked the staff & was about to give a small tip, as I always do, they both said TIP TIP TIP, you give Tip! And put their hands out. I felt this was confronting and rude. I tipped anyway 50THB each, not a big tip but still not bad since I had already paid $1900THB for us to have a massage, they both gave me a disgusted look & said \" MORE TIP\" I felt humiliated & like they thought I was ungrateful, my wife was embarrassed & we both left immediately.

She stood there with a super black face and after for like less than 1 minute wait she called up to me to call my husband with a very rude gesture and black face. I called my husband and when he came out the therapist then speaks to the other therapist in thai and they both continued on.The massage was ok depending on your luck. The lady that i've got managed to cure my long term back pain and thats it.(If not for her i would rate the spa as 1) My husband's therapist just did a so so job with a lot of shortcuts. We ended up earlier than 2 hours as they take in the waiting time (if they delay the start time do check as they follow strictly to your appt time no matter what time you start). The worst of all is that both me and my husband felt terrible pain and ache soon after the massage as they never massaged the lower back . It literally felt like the whole massage and ache went to that area? I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there if possible.

That should have been the red flag to leave immediately but this was within walking distance from my hotel and I really wanted a foot massage since they had no openings for a thai massage and could take me immediately without an appt.I went to the front desk (literally looked like a hotel reception desk with all these women in suits behind the counter) and asked for a foot massage. I was told it would be a 30 minute wait. She hands me a receipt and tells me to go pay the cashier (I can't stand places that make you pay before the services are even rendered but given the amount of people coming in and out, I could see why they want pre-payment). I wait in their noisy lobby (high ceilings, poor acoustics, lots of people = loud, loud, loud). Wait for my name to get called and if you don't hear it, don't worry, they'll announce your name over the LOUDSPEAKER. Really? The only place I've heard your name or number being called over the loudspeaker is at a fast food restaurant.I proceed to follow the lady to the foot massage room which is essentially a huge room (about 60 chairs) filled with leather loungers. Given the amount of people in the room getting foot massages, it wasn't so loud but the most distracting was the noise coming from the hallways as you heard people getting shuffled/herded like cattle to their treatments by their therapists.The massage itself was good and for the price 300THB it was a good deal, however, a random place on the street would probably been quieter and cheaper.As others mentioned, the staff linger around you as you're sipping the tea they give you, waiting for a tip.Given the number of massage places in Bangkok, skip this location (not sure if all the Health Land's are like this) and find a place that is truly a spa and not a factory."

Here's my verdict:Divana Massage is amazing if you are seeking for a relaxing ambiance. I got the couple Siamese massage with my girlfriend and was truly amazed with their service. We were greeted with Thai herbal tea and was asked how we liked our massage; soft or medium. We chose medium. We were directed to our own private room to change. The room is clean and has a great decor. The music was relaxing and our masseuses were polite and accommodating.Now on to the massage, the massage was *drum roll* okay. I felt that was it softer than expected. It could be because I'm a guy so I didn't feel much pressure. After the massage, Divana treated us with mango and sticky rice.Now onto health land. I tried to book an appointment with health land over the phone and can agree with past tripadvisor's reviews, they're a bit rude and rushy. I decided to give them a try anyway. My girlfriend and I made an appointment but were late due to the sheer madness that is called bangkok traffic. Upon checking in, they told us that our appointments were no longer valid because we were 20 minutes late. They asked us to wait along with several other people for an hour. We both chose the Thai massage and were directed to our own room.How was it? It was long, amazing and painful. If you can take the pain and are looking to get rid of all of your knots, health land is it! In addition, it's only 500 baht for two hours !Health Land:Cleanliness: 8/10Customer service: 6/10Ambiance: 6/10Thai massage: 9/10Pain: 8/10Price: super affordable DivanaCleanliness: 9/10Customer service: 9/10Ambiance: 9/10Thai massage: 6/10Pain: 2/10Price: upscaleOverall, I liked health land a lot more. If you don't mind not having all of the bells and whistles but can take the pain and want all of your knots removed, health land is it. In contrast, if you are seeking for exceptional service and have never had a Thai massage before, Divana is the place to go since Thai massages could be quite painful. "

The only reason why I would be back would be the price. I paid THB$500 for a 2hr traditional Thai massage. It is strongly recommended that you call to make a reservation beforehand as there are a lot of walk-in customers. There are many branches across Bangkok and this is the only one that is near a BTS station. The nearest station is BTS Asok. From there it is about 300m or 10mins walk behind Terminal 21 mall. The spa centre is a sprawling 8-storey building with a huge reception. Like one commented, the welcome staff service is cold and unfriendly. I was quizzed whether I had made a booking and upon confirmation immediately requested that I make payment. We were asked to wait at the lobby and they will announce your turn over the PA system, after which your masseur would change your footwear and lead you to the lift.As it is a traditional Thai massage we were asked to changed into robes but sadly there were no changing rooms available for the ladies which I find the amenities wanting. The masseurs were skilled but they started chatting and laughing throughout the entire 2hrs which I found irritating as it meant the experience wasn't tranquil or serene. Pockets of silence was punctured by the sound of the air-conditioning which would be better if they and played some soothing music on the speakers instead. As with some massage centres, my biggest gripe is the absence of a head-hole when I'm lying face down. This causes me to turn my head to the side and inherently causes my neck to be strained, thus further ruining the supposedly relaxing experience of a massage. All in all I would try out other massage places and would only pop by if I happen to pass by a Health Land centre instead of actively seeking out one."

Booked a traditional thai massage at Asoke branch and the masseuse's face was as dark as the night skies outside and her strength is average at best. I know it's work as usual for them but come on...this is the service sector and creating positive impressions (by smiling) are important. Two days later I called to make a reservation and despite repeating the thai massage I wanted, the tone of the lady who answered the phone was downright rude \"what you want what you want? You want massage but what type you want?\" When she finally got it she replied \"don't have place don't have...no more. You cannot massage today.\" No apologies nothing...not even a goodbye when the call ended. Their business have grown over the years but unfortunately their service went the other way. It happens to companies that got too big and take their customers for granted - Healthland is a good example. Try the smaller chains and you may be pleasantly surprised."

It's relatively cheap compared to many other massage places out there. Health Land at Asoke looks very established and organised. We booked our 7pm slot in the morning. Make sure you call and make booking in advance and never walk in to avoid disappointment. Arriving at Health Land 15 minutes before the appointment, there were already a lot of people sitting in the spacious lobby waiting for their massages. We paid at the counter, then waited for the receptionist to call our name. Two massage ladies came to pick us up from the lobby and brought us to the room. Although it's a 2 hour session, we started at 7.15pm (taking lift, changing clothes), and ended at 9pm promptly. During the massage, the lady did occasionally go out for toilet break and wash her hands before massaging my head. So they didn't give me the full 2 hour services. However, massage was good, and I fell asleep half way, got woken up by the television light which was turned on by the massage lady."

My friend and I had a very disappointing experience after booking a 2-hr Thai massage. The premises were nice-looking but the service left a lot to be desired. Our joint 6.30 rub down didn't end up starting until 6.45 (me) and 6.50 (my friend). The quality of my massage was OK, but not great - I got the sense she couldn't be bothered - and my friend's masseuse pretty much ignored him throughout (no mean feat during this kind of one-on-one interaction)!An hour or so in, both masseuses took an impromptu 5-10 minute break. After the next phase of the treatment - a head massage - we were being goodbyed to at 8.25.We reported our lost 25/30 mins to the reception staff and the de-relaxation began: the woman in charge made us wait 20 mins while our complaint was disputed in front of us and the masseuses shot us dirty looks. Eventually - finally! - a heated discussion in the lobby won us the right proportion of our 1000THB back.Realxing? No! Every other massage we've had in Thailand has been better - even in the cheaper places - and thankfully came without all the hassle attached. Maybe you'll be luckier than we were, but I'd probably advise anyone to avoid the risk and try elsewhere."

            "review": "Rude staff. I live in Bangkok and Healthland (Asok) has been my go-to place for massages for the past year, but recently, I've started to notice that the service there is not that great. I usually book appointments first thing in the morning because it leaves the rest of the day to do something else. I've never been late for an appointment, but the check-in takes forever. That wouldn't be a problem because I like to relax before a massage, but I've noticed that the masseuse considers the \"waiting\" time as \"massage\" time and I get cheated out of 20, sometimes 30 minutes of massage. For example, if you book a two-hour massage starting at 9am, and you don't actually hit the massage mat until 9:30 because of the check-in delay, they WILL end the massage at 11am, so you are essentially missing out on 30 minutes worth of massage time. Last week, I took my mom to Healthland as a treat. In our case, we booked a Thai massage first thing in the morning when the place opened at 9am. Every time I book a massage, the receptionist who receives my call warns me that I MUST be on time, which is why I am never late. We arrived around 8:45am and the place was open, but only one person (the only one who can speak English fluently) was shuffling around at the reception area getting the place ready. This has been the case during all my visits and I\u2019ve noticed that the lady gets upset when you approach her too early. This time, she was already taking care of someone, so I got in line to claim my reservation. The lady was nice this time and when two other ladies showed up behind the counter, she told me to pay for the service upfront. So I went up to one of them to try to pay and was told curtly that I had to wait\u2026..but the lady just said that I had to pay\u2026..I\u2019ve also noticed that masseuses and other receptionists were showing up to work after 9:00, thus delaying the check-in process even more. By the time we were directed upstairs to the massage area, it was already 9:17. I told my mother to hurry up and change because every minute counts. My mom, who doesn\u2019t know the Thai custom of non-confrontation, went up to one of the masseuses and told her that it was already 20 past the hour. The masseuse took offense and started to yell at my mother: \u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s 20 past the hour?!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you think I can read the clock?!\u201d \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m going to do?!!\u201d I was pretty shocked that she reacted that way considering that the Thais are very unassuming people. Perhaps my mother shouldn\u2019t have said anything, but the bottom line is that we are the customers and that attitude was uncalled for. The masseuse took the blanket and instead of covering my mom up with it, she dropped it on her. She then proceeded to complain about us in Thai to the other masseuse. The next two hours were spent uncomfortably and we didn\u2019t enjoy our massage. We did get the full two-hour massage this time, thanks to my mother. Hindsight, I probably should have requested a different masseuse for my mother. Healthland churns customers like water and they don\u2019t stop to think about how they are treating us. At the end of the massage, the masseuses usually have their hands out for tips which I think is very presumptuous. I\u2019m starting to think that I need to find another spa that treats customers with respect."

We enjoyed the Thai massage, but the foot massage was the very bad experiences for both me and my wife.The foot massage staff did a very poor job in massaging my wife's feet and we called in the manager, Mr. Zee, for a replacement, but was not given a replacement after 20 minutes waiting. We ended up with the same person after 20 minutes waiting for the replacement. The masseur came back again did a lousy job and did it for only another 20 minutes which brought the total time in less than 40 minutes. My wife waited 20 minutes and finished at the same time when the one did for me finished. Also both of them never do the typical 15 minutes final stretching & massage hand, shoulder after the foot massage. They basically just announce it finished after the foot massage.We asked the Manager and he confirmed that they were supposedly to do the massage of the hand, shoulder, head for 15 minutes after they did the foot massage. THEY DID NOT.I asked for the refund of the foot massage since we were not satisfied with the services, but Mr. Zee claimed the register had been closed. Again, we were disappointed with the manager's incapability of taking care of the situation."

Usually i wouldn't care, but that day i had a tight timeline, so it set a frustrated mood for the massage.They also make you pay BEFORE the massage, which i think is a little odd as it doesn't afford the opportunity to judge the tip based on the actual quality of the massage.

The masseuses are so attentive and the massages so good that we ended up tipping well.So, why only 4-stars?

HOWEVER, we had started to have Thai massages and we've been very happy with these, and will continue going here but probably only for Thai massages. They only have one option for a Thai massage and its for two hours. One wears Thai pyjamas ( no oil), and is massaged and stretched on a mattress placed on the floor. There are private rooms for singles and double rooms for couples. The double rooms do engender some talking between the therapists which is a distraction. Its generally not a lot, but even a total or five minutes spread over two hours can disturb the peace and quiet. A Thai massage costs 500 Baht, which is about $17 for the two hours. They sell books of ten for 4000 Baht. A foot massage ( one hour) is 300 Baht. Bottom line. We would rate them 2 stars for foot massage and 4.5 stars for Thal massage."

At 10am, we were told there is no more rooms for 2 person for aromatherapy massage so my husband and i ended up in separate rooms as i refuse to give in to those over 2 hour massages while my husband opted for 150min back massage. Quality is average and very much bad dependent on the masseur (as in no quality control). It is very much based on luck. Would not recommend if you are used to having decent massages."

So after searching and looking for a decent one we found this near our place. At the entrance it seems like a luxury one, but they have different massage that will fit also for your budget. We had their traditional thai massage for 2hrs paying only 500BHT. We enjoy it and also their place such a relaxing environment and a hot green tea after the massage is a plus!"

Now of course you can always find cheaper massages in Thailand, of which they on occasion can be decent as well but the variability is often high so it can be crapshoot on what you actually get.This joint however, recommended by our hotel staff, hit the spot for us. We did the 90' thai oil massage and were not displeased. I have probably had 100+ thai massages and would say this one ranked in top 4 or 5 for quality of massage and relaxation factor.The not quite there was i thought price was a bit high and the front desk could have been more hospitable upon arrival. I would definitely consider returning if i was ever in area again."

I tried to go two or three times during the summer and the fall without a reservation, and I was always told that it was fully booked for the Thai massage, so I needed to pick up a much more expensive package. Of course, I didn't, as the price were unacceptable by a Thai standard.Then yesterday, as I was with a friend, we decided to make a reservation for today. We were told that the reservation would be cancelled if we arrived 10 minutes late. We arrived 6 minutes late, but the girl at the reception told us that our reservation had already been cancelled. We showed her our phones, where the clock showed that we were 6 minute late (actually, one more minute has passed during queuing and the conversation with the reception). With her finger she pointed at a clock they keep at the reservation, and she told us that their clock shows that we were already 10 minute late. We picked up the very clock that she pointed at, and it showed exactly the same time of our phones, meaning that not even by their clock we were late.She wouldn't listen to any reason and she called her manager who only kept saying \" you don't have to be irritated, and your booking has been canceled because probably another clock shows that you are 10 minute late\".Then another top manager appeared and offered us to \"revive\" our booking, but we were so angry by that behavior that we refused and left.I've been spending most of my time in Thailand since the 90s, I have been living in Bangkok for more than one year now and previously I lived in Chiang Mai; I never experienced such a horrible service in any other place in the country (and I'm not talking only of massage places).You can get a good massage at the same or a better price in many other places around, so I don't think you need to go to this place just to be cheated by their inept reception staff."

Gone are the great food and the traditional Thai massages.From the outside Health Land looks like a retro mansion and inside it\u2019s a little like Grand Central Station. The moment I walked in, it was far from a tranquil environment. Though well decorated, I felt like I was in a factory production line. Until you get to your treatment room, you\u2019re just a number (or rather name). They\u2019ll call your name (through a microphone) and you\u2019ll be escorted from the waiting room to an area with benches where you\u2019ll exchange your shoes for slippers and greet your therapist. Then you\u2019ll be led to the elevator and on to your room. I felt like I was going for a ride in a theme park.The staff at the reception desk may not be the friendliest welcome team around but once you get are enjoying your Thai massage you will soon forget about this.The massage was amazing! I\u2019ve been to other places where they just hurt you. The masseur here uses her hands, arms, elbows, knees and feet apply firm, rhythmic pressure to various parts of the body along with the masseuese taking a casual stroll up and down the length of the back. My lower back got more attention as I\u2019d requested and the pain significantly reduced. She is a true Thai massage master. She\u2019s strong and has big thick arms and hands. She was built for giving massages. Thank GOD for her.The price is really worth what you get!!!!

To be honest, I've only had one bad massage here out of ten, but the lady who mentioned they need quality control is correc,t as there are bad practices here in terms of shortened massage time compared to advertised and late starting for bookings. You have to be gently firm with the managers before you go for the massage if you are called late and more often than not they will tell the masseuse to extend time. On the upside, the quality& consistency here really is better. Yes, at local shops you get more time and it can be cheaper (or even more expensive at the boutique salons), but these ladies are well trained in anatomy and physiology whilst many of the street salons make it up as they go along. Bsd training and practice is more likely to cripple you than anything. Yes, you can strike lucky on the street, but equally you can come out wrecked.. So, some quick words of advice to the traveller:1. if possible use a referral from another traveller to a specific masseuse who has a good rep whether in health land, or anywhere else, 2. If you find a good masseuse who suits you stick with them (you can request specific masseuse in HL too.3. NEVER go with an acutely bad back as if something has changed recently, this is your back telling you something is wrong and Thai massage can make it worse.Go to a physio, chiro or osteopath and get a proper fix.Mild discomfort is ok with Thai massage however and long term muscle spasm, such as old sporting injuries can really gain good sustained relief. 4. If you do have a long a long term problem, go no more frequently than every 48 hours to allow recovery and if you are prepared to do 3, or more sessions it will just get better and better. Finally, tip the ladies folks, especially if they have done a good job. This goes a long way towards their income and the quality of your future massages. Remember, they earn only 130 Bhat from each 2 hour massage, so tips make the difference from subsistence living. 50 baht will do, but 100 is better and they will remember......."

We did try to make a appointment the night before but it was fully booked. So a tip for the readers here is to book early lest disappointment.Nevertheless, we decided to try our luck anyway since we are in the vincinity to shop at Terminal 21. To go Healthland, walk along Sukhumvit 19 road (which is the road between Terminal 21 and Westin Grande Sukhumvit Bangkok) and turn right at the first major cross-junction. It took us about roughly 15mins of walk.Indeed, it was a wise choice to try our luck by going there. We were lucky enough to be given 2 slots of 2hrs thai massage for each person almost immediately as apparently there was a no-show.Generally, my wife and I liked the massage. Price was reasonable in our opinions. Clean place overall. Masseurs made a bit of small talk at the beginning and end of the massage. The whole building was pretty huge with 7 levels I think, and the open carpark in front of Healthland was quite big as well.As we were done and left Healthland, it rained heavily. Luckily we have a small umbrella in our sling bag. However, it was not enough as by the time we walked back to the Asok BTS station, we were both rather drenched. Sukhumvit 19 road is rather low lying and it floods at some parts of the road. So if you are planning a visit there, it never hurts to play safe by arming yourself with a brolly.On the whole, I and my wife are happy with this experience and would recommend readers over here to pay it a visit for a massage at least once or twice during your Bangkok stay."

This is important so you don't get a neckache after the session. Some cheaper places don't offer such beds. Aircon can be adjusted.The skill was so so. She used strength and was attentive when I asked her to press my neck more. But one requires experience to know how and where to press and not merely using strength. If you just want strength and not fussy with skill, I guess it's alright. I'm too pampered by my skilful massue back home. And in Bangkok, I've had better at good and cheaper places. So I won't go again. Not recommended unless you think paying for ambience is important."

I was strongly recommended by a friend to not leave Bangkok without a visit to this place for the 2 hour Traditional Thai Massage @ 500 Baht. And I did just that on the day I was flying back and am so glad for it. The place was conveniently located from our hotel, Novotel on Ploenchet Road - just two stops away by the BTS Sky Train right from the front of our hotel. Walk into Soi 19 and take the first right turn into Soi 21 and you find this huge building on your left. Walking into the large reception area, there was a sense of quiet tranquility and a very efficient staff there ensured that within 5 mins I was escorted by this tiny Thai lady to a room on the 7th floor. It helped that I had made a prior appointment or else the wait may be more. The whole ambience was quiet, peaceful, with muted lights.I was a bit sceptical and worried initially as there was a language problem. I didn't understand Thai and she had very limited knowledge of English and I was worried about her triggering off some pains as I have some back and shoulder issues. I didn't know how to explain her my concerns. Somehow with gestures etc I communicated with her and we kept laughing at our communicating styles but she ended up giving me the best massage of my life. She applied just the right pressure and knew instinctively where all I was hurting and worked away on my muscles. By the end of it I felt like a completely new person - my pains had reduced considerably and I literally skipped out of that place. I just wish I had visited earlier, I would have probably included it as a daily regime for 3 days of my stay in Bangkok. I did end up tipping the masseuse additionally for the wonderful massage she gave. It does take a lot of physical effort on their part.The session ended with a refreshing herbal tea that added to the whole experience.Definitely a must do for any future trips to Bangkok."

Little did I know how badly the visit would turn out. Went to the counter, asked for a one and half hour massage. Paid up, went into the room and had a shower. Masseuse came in after a while. Started the massage. Not too bad, but nothing to shout about by Thailand's standards. Strange thing was that the masseuse stood up and told me that she was done after 50min. I looked at the clock - there was at least still a good half hour to go. Since she'd already gone out, I got dressed and went to the counter to ask if I had ordered the one hour massage by mistake.Counter receptionist told me that no, I'd ordered the one and half hour massage. They also insisted that the time began from when I took a shower. That was ridiculous - it barely lasted 5 min. They then ignored me when I asked to speak to the manager. As it was, all of them started ignoring me and pretended to be busy. I then asked to see the time slips and took out my receipt to show other customers. That's when they got panicky and asked the bouncers to escort me out. Worst rip-off experience ever."

The massage was not very good. Small local places are much better, and my back hurts worse than it did before I had a massage! Half way through the massage, she left the room for 15 minutes, and finally came back to finish at 7:20! All in all, the massage was about an hour and 15 minutes, and after reading other people's reviews, I see that they are INTENTIONALLY giving less than what you pay for. Not like your complaints have much credibility with them as you have to pay before your massage."

The range of service was wide and I like how you don't have to share a room if you are a couple/foursome. Not sure what happens if you are alone. Only tried the thai massage (2 hours but they finished in 1 hr 45 mins) and thai massage with hot compress. My masseuse complied to my requests so I am happy. I'd gone to luxury day spas + walk in \"cheap\" shops but by far this is the best compromise in terms of value and service.

I recommend purchasing 10-coupon booklet for a private room (4000 THB/10 times). If you just want to relax, Traditional Thai massage for 2 hours should do, just advise the therapist how you like your massage. They understand basic English terms ( stronger, softer...) But those who experience severe neck, shoulder and back pain like me, i highly recommend Ayurveda Massage. The therapist is well trained and qualified so really know what she is doing. after 2-3 hours of this massage, i feel so light and very relaxed. You can use the coupon for this type of massage as well. Advance booking for this place is highly recommended so you won't have to go thru the long boring wait.

I walked there from the Sofitel in less than fifteen minutes. This review reflects a total of two massages I've had at Health Land Asoke over the past year. Overall, for an efficient, clean, and decent massage in concert with location (I like staying in Sukumvit), Health Land is a solid option.  For 500baht/2 hr Thai massage you get an organized, clean, up to date large facility. On both occasions the organization of the place has left me impressed. So much that one could say its even a bit sterile and cold. Payment is upfront as you enter. The surroundings are pleasant and modern so if there is waiting involved, your senses won't be irritated. After they call you (or your party by name) its up/down some elevators to stop off to collect sandals. The massage room set up is rather basic. The tv set in the room seemed well out of place though. Change in the gown in the massage room and its go time. I can't really rate the massage other than to say you have to try a Thai massage at least once. The female masseuses (there were two of us in our party) barely spoke english. But with some universal signals we were underway. This review isn't about THai massage, but needless to say there are some moments of dire pain and some moments I found myself easily nodding off to sleep.  At the conclusion of the massage, I felt it was in a bit of bad taste for my masseuse to remind me she needed a tip. Of course, I was going to tip, and I do want to pause and think about things through a cultural prism. So here goes, Health Land could do their workers and clients a favor and better communicate about how tipping should be addressed. Clearly, these hard workers deserve something for their effort, but going about it in a professional and consistent manner would be nicer.  Post-massage is another magic elevator ride to a room where shoes are collected and a sweet tea is served. As you've already paid to enter, this ends the Health Land experience. From a cash burn perspective, the value is fantastic. Health Land is professional and organized, maybe a bit too much so. There is an assembly line feel to it all, but having made that assessment, I've only done Thai massage there so I don't what lies behind other doors but literally and metaphorically. Enjoy the experience and do have your hotel concierge book the appointment on your behalf. It's just easier since this is not a 5 Star Hotel spa and the level of english is naturally going to vary a bit....."

They pretty much said I was lying because the tag given to the masseuse said 5:30! I said there was no way because we had paid and had to sit and wait for our services and we had arrived at 5:30! Anyway truly disappointed as I had high expectations and I couldn't believe the mgr pretty much insinuated that I was a liar. Plus they were all avoiding me and were all talking about me in Thai before she actually came by to talk to me!

We were looking for one with no funny business...a traditional 2 hour thai massage. Health Land delivered. Check in process is professional. The pant-suit clad woman who runs the front desk has a bit of an attitude, but she runs a tight ship. She'll roll her eyes at you if you have questions, but that's not a deal breaker. Pricing is incredibly reasonable. While it might be a little higher ($12 instead of $10) than some of the other places on the street, you're paying for things like air conditioning, cleanliness, etc. Wait times are pretty accurate. Rarely have I been asked to wait longer than 10 minutes there. Clothes provided were clean and freshly washed. Bed linens appeared to be, as well. Masseuse was professionally attired. English isn't their strong suit usually, but you can communicate clearly when you need to. While the quality of the massage there can vary from \"good\" to \"amazing,\" I've never had a \"bad\" one. I had one woman put an undue amount of pressure on my spine (not my erectors, but the vertebrae) which was painful. I said \"Mai!\" showed her where to avoid with my finger and a head shake, and she complied. If you're looking for a shorter, more targeted option, go for a 1 hour therapeutic massage. They'll work on whatever muscle group is troubling you."

I made a complaint to the reception but was told there was nothing they can do as I remorsefully went through the whole session. My lesson is, after 10 mins of your massage and you feel the standards is bad, ask for a replacement immediately. Being nice will just get you a frustrating and painful massage experience.Not the best in town to go for. Go only it is really near where you stay, otherwise save the trouble."

This time our hotel booked the Aromatherapy Massage in advance for us but when we arrived at Health Land, we were again told that it was not available and were recommended a more expensive package. We tried our luck with another staff and she said ok. Unfortunately, the 1st staff intervened in Thai language and then the other staff changed her words and said the Aromatherapy Massage was not available. We refused to take any other packages. When we complained to the hotel staff who booked the massage for us, he called Health Land and they insisted that our booking was for Thai Massage and not Aromatherapy Massage!Although the massage at Healthland was not bad, we are completely put off by their lack of integrity and doubt that we would go there again.

At the reception you have to choose your service and pay for the same, there is usallay a 10 - 20 minute waiting specially during weekends and the staff tells you at the time of choosing the treatment. The front office wasnot very helpful if you have queries as they were far too busy attending to all customers but there is some literature in English that gives you the brief of the treatment. The treatment is done in professional, hygenic, soothing rooms. It is great value for money if you compare it with a hotel spa but the advantage in hotels is that you can ask for some massages by the pool or in the comfort of you room. While I had a great experience on two ocassions, I reckon the quality of masseuse can perhaps make or break your experience. It is a normal practice to tip 50 t0 100 baht depending on the treatment time and your expertise of the masseuse."

The place looked very nice & modern with beautiful ambient lighting. When I walked in, I immediately saw some menu boards but it didn't look like the menu I saw on the website or a normal massage menu. Most of the stuff there were in a foreign language & didn't sound Thai. So I went up to the counter & told them I wanted a massage. The same menu were on the counter - nothing else. The woman asked me if I wanted an oil massage and I did wanted an aromatherapy massage, so I said yes, and she pointed to the menu board & recommended a 90-min massage (some foreign name that started with an A). I paid THB 1,200 for it. On hindsight, I should've asked if they had an aromatherapy massage & insisted on it. The treatment room was also nicely lit, but the bed still felt slightly oily, which felt icky. The music was also rather strange - slow classical music with low crashing waves (Schumann isn't exactly relaxing for me) and then instrumental jazz. I like the fact that the room has a small shower cubicle so I could immediately wash the icky oil off. My masseuse was very courteous, but perhaps not very skilled. It was a shallow massage, using a synthetic-smelling oil. She also wanted to mix the oil with some spices and put it on my head but I declined. Afterwards she told me the massage I had was an Indian/Ayurvedic massage. I still tipped her because I felt it wasn't her fault that I didn't enjoy that particular type of massage. I would not recommend Health Land to anyone. Even the little (non-sleazy) parlors on Soi 11 were more satisfying & more honest than this."

The thai therapeutic massage is not for the faint- hearted as the intent is to really get into the muscles & joints so practice your deep breathing before signing up for this one. For a relaxing treat try the body scrub & aromatherapy massage. 2.5 hours of pampering for a little over $50.00 AUD, what a bargain! Yes, the staff are hoping for a tip but really guys- surely they deserve a little something extra given the average incomes that they earn.

The reception staff was courteous. My masseuse was very professional. She asked if I how hard I wanted the massage and on what areas I wanted her to concentrate. Let me give one piece of advice. Hard means hard. I told her I wanted the massage to be between medium and hard, and she complied. At times, it was a bit too much pressure. Nevertheless, I left feeling refreshed, and the next day I felt even better. The massage was the equivalent of US$20. It was worth every penny, and I would do it again."

It's a big establishment and lots of rooms. Getting an appointment wasn't tough. However, expect not a very friendly treatment at the counter.. But the price they charge and given that its a clean massage place, it's ok to bear it for 2 mins!"

We walked in and was straightface greeted by a tall dramatic looking hostess. After quickly browsing their offerings we politely asked \"excuse me...\" yet noone was interested. After 8 mins a very old abrupt hostess led us to the male cashier and said \"what do u want\". We booked in for pressure points massage and reflexology which she indicated were available immediatley but aromatherapy has to be waited on. Funny how we paid and hung around akwardly for a further 16mins before someone called on a tannoy to escort us to a therapist room. Massage was standard. Nothing negative to say. But the reception is enough to anger anyone! Stick to Let's Relax for better service, similar pricing, and positive energy staff!!!"

I hardly write reviews, but this experience motivated me, I almost write this as a warning.What others have said is true - the place is enormous, you are just being put through a massage mill. The most noticeable receptionist is already mentioned (tall, mohawked) and seems almost consciously impolite, which of course doesn't help first impressions. Note if you are late for your appointment they cancel it immediately and then some other poor sod waiting on standby grabs your spot. We had the aromatherapy massage. It always depends who you get but our masseuses were both poor-mediocre, imprecise, inconsistent, bored. It was one of the least enjoyable massages I have had... it's definitely not a place we'll return to. We have a lot of experience with Thai massages having had many long stays in Bangkok. This was in every aspect a disappointing experience, and the worst for bad attitude and low skill. We did not feel very refreshed afterward, we were just glad to leave.When I was lying facedown on the massage table, I saw a cockroach crawl past on the floor. Bugs are common in Bangkok of course, but this did not improve the \"ambience\". The place is generally poorly lit and dark - dark walls, dark brown bathrooms, dark floors. It gives a feeling this hides the dirt ...We know people who make Bangkok their home, and we only discovered later that we chose badly when we walked into this spa. This is a place for local Thai who can handle rough Thai massage better perhaps, and for (mainly Asian) tourists who don't know any better place."

The place is flooded with guests who hanged around waiting for a slot or cancellation. I made a booking via phonecall a week prior to my arrival.Healthland Asoke is a 10 minutes walk from ASOKE BTS. For us, we took the easiest way - a cab from Pratnum. It has a luxurious and zen layout throughout the whole building and looked very classy. The front counter staff was a bit unfriendly perhaps due to the number of guests hoovering her counter. I told them i had an prior appointment and asked to sit down and wait. Shortly they called out my name via a speaker (haha).I was brought to the waiting lounge for my slippers. The place was huge. My treatment room was on 8th floor and there are almost 20 rooms on each floor. Our therapists are very skillful. The private rooms are clean and nicely appointed. They didn't talk much but ok to me. Dont expect to sleep during the treatment as they were practically cranking your bones every single minute but i felt so refreshed after the whole treatment. I wish i have time for another session.Baht $500 for a 2 hours treatment totally worth it. Highly recommended! Will come again."

But you spend a total of a few minutes max talking to her, so who cares? It's about the massage.I've had back and hip pain for about four years now. I've seen probably two dozen doctors (including the top orthopods in the area), physical therapists, massage therapists, and even chiropractors and acupuncturists in that time in an attempt to get to the root of the problem and fix it. Outside of the temporary relief granted by a cortisone shot, nothing has even put a dent in the pain.I was wrapping up a three week trip in Thailand where I had been to massage shops nearly every day. Sometimes I'd get a Thai massage, sometimes an oil massage, and plenty of them were great. But again, none of them ever relieved the pain for more than a couple of hours. So, on my way back out of the country, I booked an appointment at Healthland Asoke for their back pain relief package, which was about 2.5 hours long and cost a little over 2,000 baht. That's a bit more expensive than your standard massage shop, but they offered up a few more services and it's still not all that much (most hour massages here in the states will cost you more than that). Plus the private rooms here are very nice and well-appointed.The masseuse didn't speak much English, but she's Thai, so that's on me and not her. But she was pleasant enough. The massage itself was very nice and thorough. I had never experienced a hot herbal compress before, but I enjoyed it. The masseuse left the room after the massage and allowed me to shower in the room's private shower, which was very nice as I had herbal residue all over me. I still couldn't get it all off in one shot. She escorted me back upstairs, gave me a tea, and seemed genuinely appreciative of her tip.But in the end, the five star rating is due to the fact that this massage alone, unlike the hordes of specialists I've seen in the last four years, cured my hip pain 100%. The back pain is still there, but I can't discount the importance of no longer hobbling along or being unable to participate in in sports due to a bum hip. It's only been a month, but even a month of relief is more than I've ever seen before and well worth the five stars and 2,000 (or so) baht."

Massage ladies always hanging around for your tip and grumble openly in front of you if they think you give them too little. foot massage very cheap but the ladies are also doing it halfheartedly.Conclusion: This place isn't the top recommended place in TripAdvisor. people who usually willing to go either had a good experience before or after the cheap price.

Fine, as we did not have reservation in advance, we were fine to settle with Hot Oil Massage which was obviously more expensive than aromatherapy massage. I guess this is their front desk strategy in getting more revenue. During my last visit in February, i was told the same thing. I do not mind paying more if service rendered was good quality like my last visit.I had the worst experience visiting Health Land Spa in Asoke this time. I had the worst and unprofessional therapist. When asked for more pressure as she was merely touching my back, she simply elbowed on my back with her whole weight on me.Instead of strokes, she scratched my back with her nails!!!I was very disspointed with the worst therapist!!!

I suppose it depends on who you get since Health Land is so big, with so many masseuse. I like the location of this HL. It is only couple of blocks from Asoke BTS. HL reception area is large, plenty of waiting areas, clean and fairly quiet. I walke-in, rather than pre-booked, at around 11:30 am. There were several customers prior to me, so the waiting was roughly 45 min. My husband was hesitant, but I wanted to wait in order to try out at this location since my usual massage location (since 1998) is now out of business. Note: while I was waiting, I noticed there were as many Thai customers (young and old) as foreign customers. At about 45 minutes, my name was called. I followed a young lady (about 30-40s) to the massage room on the 7th floor. The room had 2 mats, but I was the only customer in the room. The room was cleanly furnished, including runner on mat & orchid on pillow. There was a TV in room but it not turned on. Room temperature was comfortable. Mat was firm but not too firm. The room and surrounding hallway was very quiet, in general, except for one time when what sounded like a group of customers being led to their rooms. My masseuse was very good, slowly worked over my body. Some of my mussle groups were brought to my attention, I did not even know I had. My 2-hour session was exactly 115 minutes from the time I laid down on the mat until I sat up, getting ready to get dressed. I noticed the time, as I noticed my masseuse was looking at the clock (in the room) when she asked my to lie down on my back. As far as costs, the cost for Thai massage is very comparable to other locations (400-500 Bt, even at Wat Po it would cost more if admission fees takken into account).All in all, I had very good Thai massage. I cannot say for other services. I definitely will be back for another Thai massage session in 2 days time."

            "review": "Not worth the money. My mother and I went to this spa on the 8th of March thinking that it would be a great experience as it is quite big and always seems to be busy. We booked our appointment for a facial and aromatherapy massage for 8pm - to which we were told to be on time, however they made us wait 15 minutes before being led in to take off our shoes. The massage beds are incredibly uncomfortable and the 'aromatherapy' massage we both received was absolutely horrible. There was no pressure at all so it felt quite uncomfortable to be gently rubbed up and down. I have had many aromatherapy massages before (including in Bangkok) and they have all been great. Then the facial - which made me feel incredibly claustrophobic. The lady was constantly rubbing around my nostrils (sounds funny I know) but the cream was getting in my nose and I couldn't breathe then when I tried to breathe through my mouth cream somehow miraculously got in there too!The other thing that was disappointing was the fact that we had paid for a 90 minute massage and 60 minutes facial. We walked out fully dressed at 10:30! They didn't have smiles on their faces and they were just waiting there for a tip - to which they began b****ing when they didn't get one.My advice would be to go down the road to Sukhumvit Soy 19 to Lotus massage (close to a 7eleven) they are cheaper and much better value for money! They girls always have smiles on their faces and I always walk out feeling better - not worse - than when I walked in."

(Heard so much about this place so decided that we should try it for ourselves!)We were amazed by the size of this spa. It resembled a hotel! 8 storeys high with a big reception lobby! I thought the spa was within a hotel but I was wrong! It's a 8 storey building dedicated to spa!!We didn't make any reservations but got a slot nonetheless. There were probably about 50 people waiting in the reception area.. Waiting for their names to be called and for the therapist to lead them to the rooms. I felt very 'industrialized' and didn't feel very pampered (as I normally would when I visit other spas).we waited for about 15 mins and our names were finally called. We were brought to the 7th floor and both my wife and myself were led to different rooms.. No couple room apparently. The room was nice and clean. there was nice music piped in as well. Once inside i was asked to take a shower. About 15 mins later, the therapist returned to the room and started the massage. The massage, was really averaged at best. It felt as if the therapist was going thru motion.. She was probably tired having done many others before me and so wasn't putting a lot of strength into the massage as well. My wife later commented the same for her therapist. Within an hour, the massage ended! We later realized that the 1.5hrs included waiting time and showering time!!! For the price we paid, 850baht each, we felt we could have done better in the many other spa centers available around BkK. We have been to some nice smaller spas that charged 400 baht for one full hr massage and came out feeling more rejuvenated then this!Will I return to Health land? Probably never.. I think it's been way over rated and will explore some other smaller but more personal spa centers in future."

I booked a couples aroma message for my wife and I. We were taken to a nice room (clean, nicely lit, perfect temperature, classical music playing), with dual showers in the room. The massages were very nice - more relaxing than the traditional thai massage, exactly what we needed. They are very respective of your privacy, only uncovering one body part at a time, so we felt very comfortable. After the massage we were given some flavourful tea. It was a very good deal, getting an entire private room and 2 massages for under 2000 baht. We just moved to Bangkok and will return again."

As with any spa, it all depends on the massage person you get, doesn't matter if it is high end or on the street. I was at Health Land Asoke yesterday with a friend. We both got massages, mine was one of the best I've had, theirs was one of the worst they had ever had. I was the lucky one. When I find a good therapist, I always find out their name and go back and see them specifically. So of course I booked another 2 hour massage for today as yesterday's therapist was so good.Got to my appointment and was informed they did not have my reservation and the therapist was not working today. I confirmed with reception 3 times yesterday as I don't trust.The worse part is the receptionist I talked to today just kept coming up with excuses for their mistake without taking blame for their error and saying sorry. They simply don't understand what a reservation is and how to deal with a problem.If they would right away have said sorry for our mistake and tried to make some effort that would have been acceptable.Giving continuous lame excuses is not the answer to please customers and get return business..."

They told me to come at 12 noon. I arrived at 11:59am. It took them a while to find my booking and by the time they billed me, it was 12:07pm (see photo). I was then asked to take a seat whilst the therapist is called. She arrived about 10 minutes later, at which point they called my name on the loudspeaker. She told me to follow her to the back of the reception area whee she took my shoes and gave me a pair of in-house slippers to put on. We waited for the lift that brought us up to one of the many floors, stopping once for another customer to get off. When we arrived at my massage room, I asked to use the toilet and was directed to the toilets at the left of the far end of the corridor. When I got back to the room, the therapist asked me to take a shower before the massage. After the shower, I finally lay on the bed. Around 30 minutes had passed since payment of the bill to now. It was around 12:30pm. I would have thought that my 2 hour massage starts starts now, but I was wrong. The massage finished at 2pm. When I checked with the therapist, she insisted that we started at 12:05pm! She said she finished 5 mins earlier to give me time to get dressed!!! This was the time on the clock in the room when I had finished getting dressed (see picture). I decided to take the matter to the reception. There, they admitted that there was something wrong with the timing, but that they would not refund me the balance. They asked me to come back again and they would give me 15 minutes extra to compensate. They also said that the clock starts to tick from the time I arrive - therefore the compensation of 15 mins and not 30 mins if I come back for another treatment! Not their fault if they were late to find me booking, late to bill me, made me wait for the therapist to arrive, etc. I said that I was leaving the next day and could not come back. Even if I came back, I would want a different therapist as this one had not impressed me. They said that both was not possible. I don't know if this is how massage places operate in Bangkok, especially big, popular ones, but I am quite disappointed with how unprofessional they are, very surprising given how big and well-known they are with many branches across the city."

Would not recommend Foot Reflexology, even though it is fairly reasonably priced at 280 Baht per hour. They don't actually work on your foot very hard, it is more of a leg massage, plus a little bit of arms and shoulders. We found Traditional Thai Massage at 450 Baht for 2 hours still the best deal. The masseuses were competent, and they had a feeling for the needs of your body. Also tried the Abhyanga-Shirodara-Package, which was really excellent, but at 2600 Baht for 2.5 hrs is not the best value for money Bangkok has to offer. Paid 2600 in advance, made an appointment, went there the next day only to find out that they could not do it and had to reschedule. Two days later it finally worked. Also went there on 12/31 for a Thai Massage, when they sent us right home, because they would only accept customers with a valid appointment. Conclusion: the quality is good, but you need patience."

The masseuse respected my requests for a gentler massage around my neck. When I got back to my hotel I was so relaxed and restful I missed dinner and slept through the entire night.Second massage 2 days later was the complete opposite. The masseuse treated me like I was a peace of meat. She was rough, aggressive and uncaring. I couldn't wait to finish. I ended up with a sore neck for 3 days. In both cases they were Thai massages. A Thai massage should be given with compassion, joy and love. From my experience it was a hit or miss in this factory like setting."

Appointments are hard to come by and after getting a time slot the previous evening, i called again a couple of hrs before my scheduled time just to re-confirm the appt. I did not want to go all the way down only to find they cocked it up. Reservation staff was gruff and curt over the line and told me that the appt was still on for 7pm and i am supposed to arrive 10 mins before the timing. If i'm late, booking will be cancelled. Before i could reply ok, the phone was put down. Great Start!Took a taxi down. The building facade and lobby was way nicer than i expected it to be. Kudos on that. Once inside, i was once again treated to the same curt and gruff service by the front counter staff. Took my name and quickly told me to pay 900 baht for 2 pax Thai massage. No issues on the price. After that, was pointed to the couches and told to wait. As i am waiting, the lobby is full of customers. Customers are both arriving and leaving. Your name is then announced over a PA system when your masseuses are ready. You can imagine the noise since i already mentioned that theres so many customers. I am then ushered to a holding area, given slippers to change into and then made to follow masseuses to wait for 2 lifts to bring us up to our room. As we wait for the lifts, there are 4 other couples standing around us. Once lift arrives, we are then ushered into it and packed as many of us as the lift can take. At this stage, images of cattle herding springs right to mind.Rooms are clean and the actual massage was ok. Nothing mind-blowing but ok. That being said, masseuses are genuinely nice and caring.Overall experience was negative enough for me to not want to go back. Bottom line is that despite the physical place being really nice looking, i came to a massage spa to relax. If you have gruff and curt front line staff coupled with loud PA system announcements before i start my massages, then the massages better be fantastic enough to calm me down and make me want to go through all that again in a return visit. The problem is that the massages are extremely ordinary. You will find a similar standard at 90% of the mid range massage outlets in Bangkok. Which begs the question: Do i need to put myself through all this service rubbish? Verdict: Health Land Spa - Victim of its own success? Most definitely!"

The final touche of a hot tea after the massage has also been compromised with luke warm normal tea on uncomfortable benches.That said, you would still need to make a reservation as they are always full, more so if you want a couple or family of 4 (max) room. Our family had so much fun massaging together in the same room.Btw, I learnt from the masseurs that they are paid 50-80 Baht per massage (depending on the type and duration of the massage). They can only take a maximum of 6 sessions because they would be so tired after that. So please remember to tip them generously if you are happy with their services."

And the little back/neck rub at the end was just plain painful. A factory feel to this place. About 30 La-Z-Boys arrayed in a big hall. Kinda weird. I heard the dude across the room snoring."

Two friends recommended it this time and browsing through their website, we were intrigued. On our first attempt on a Saturday night, they were booked solid so we made reservations for the next evening. From the outside, it is impressive. Inside, it is busy. No tranquil atmosphere. If there was any spa music playing, it was drowned out by the loud voices of customers (mostly tourists) hanging around the main lobby. I chose the 2-hour Traditional Thai Massage and my companions had the 90-minute Oil Massage. Without much pomp and circumstance, we were ushered up in an elevator to the 8/F, into a clean room. My massage was exceptional and I was unkinked, as I hoped to be. My companions were also raving about their treatments. For the price, we were satisfied customers. This is a great place to get a good massage but not the right place if you are looking for pampering and tranquility."

The lobby was nice and impressive. Unfortunately, we had to wait 25 minutes to be seen even though we had reservations.This was our first time getting a Thai Massage and we didn't know what to expect. Yeah, I couldn't help but laugh when my 60 year old therapist contorted my body. She also choked me a few times, lol.I didn't like how our therapists watched tv DURING the massage. I mean, I know 2 hours is a long time, but damn. This wasn't a relaxing visit by any means, but I must say, we did feel great the next day.Overall, just an OK average experience. I can't complain much since the 2 hour Thai massage was only 450 baht per person."

Only thing I didn't like was the freezing temperatures in the massive foot reflexology hall and the place being over-booked (we had to sit around for half an hour to get an available slot for our foot reflex). For some reason, the facial prices here are pretty ridiculous ($1500-$3000 baht). Stick to the awesome value for money foot massages here (which includes a short back and shoulder massage at the end of the session)"

I asked if I could make a booking for the evening but they told me they dont except bookings for the evening which I found a bit strange. I was going to try and book for another day but after checking my schedule the receptionist started chatting with another group and seemed to just ignore me and even though there were lots of reception people around, none of them asked me if I needed help.

For the treatment you are given clothes to change into and then while lying in a thin mattress in the flood you are stretched, pulled, pressed and kneaded for the next two hours. It is quite the experience for someone who had never had Thai massage before. You are given a small cup with a refreshing drink after its all done. Very nice. In my experience the massage wasn't do much relaxing and such during the actual treatment but definitely felt revived and energized after.

But it is always recommended to make a reservation during peak hours. Traffic could be hectic around this area. Easy way to get there (without being stuck in traffic) is to take either the BTS or MRT to Asoke station. Then, walk to the Soi (small street) behind Terminal 21. It's only a 5-minute walk if that. Their prices are pretty inexpensive compared to what you get. Next time I want to try a body scrub & aromatherapy massage combo!"

The ladies who carried out our aroma oil massage were efficient and polite, and the technique they applied was fairly good and even. We were also quite impressed with the set-up of the couple's room - large and comfortable; air-conditioned without being too cold; the shower area was also large enough for two persons to use, without having to wait for each other. Overall, it was a positive experience, and not bad for a first-time Health Land customer. However, our experience at the Sathorn branch the very next day left a lot to be desired (you can look up my review for that outlet). Based on other reviews here, it seems that the quality of massage at Health Land is a bit hit and miss, and based a lot on which masseuse you're assigned, so adjust your expectations accordingly. As such, I would only recommend that you try this chain out if you happen to be near an outlet and have some time to kill."

When my legs are killing me I go to the Health Land Asoke, just 10-15 mins by foot from the Terminal 21 and Asoke BTS. Luckily foot massage does not require the prior booking. Upon arrival I am always nicely greeted by the supervisor who fills out the order slip, accepts the payment and kindly asks me to take a seat in the lobby. Usually it takes 5 mins for my name to be called out, but in case if there is a queue, then the supervisor will advise the approximately waiting time. The foot massage costs 250 Bahts (~6 EUR or 8 USD) and lasts 60 mins.When my name is called out I meet my masseur, usually a lady, but I have seen also men working there. She greets me with a bow and escorts to the basement to change my shoes for comfortable slippers and my skirt to cotton pants. The massage room is big enough to accommodate quite many clients. In Health Land the massage room is thoughtfully designed to turn the open space massage experience into the discrete and private care. The lamps produce a very warm soft light. The shadowy interior, the luxurious chair and the calm, relaxing music helps to breathe easily and take the most of time-out. Before massage the masseur washes my feet, and then she helps me to get more comfortable in the chair. My arms and body covered by towels for even better, deeper relaxation. The masseur uses essential oil and begins to massage from the feet up to the knees, and upper legs. She gently and strongly presses the points, she rubs my legs to better the blood circulation, she heavenly massage each and every toe of my foot. The sensational feelings I experience are very intense and relaxing. At the end the masseur massages my arms, hands, back, shoulders and head. The treatment ends with a cup of deliciously brewed chrysanthemum tea. After 60 mins of such a wonderful care I feel great, my feet are barely touching the ground because I am flying. My mind, body and soul are rejuvenated. My husband and sons say that I even look 10 years younger. This is a fantastic value for money \u2013 for 250 Bahts I get rid of tension, fatigue, pain, aches and swollenness. Before leaving I tip the masseur (between 40-60 Bahts), because thanks to her little, strong and magical hands my tired feet get the relaxing treat."

The massage has most of the times been okay, however, there are so many different masseuses working there, that the quality of the massage depends strongly on the masseuse you get each time. So once you've got a good one, try to ask for her number or name, then you can book her next time you go there.The large number of masseuses is only a reflection of the size of the spa. The buildings are huge with several floors. But because it's so huge, you don't really get the relaxed, private, zen feeling. To me it feels actually more like being in a hospital then a spa. Upon arrival you have to chose the therapy you want and there is not always staff to explain the different items on the menu. No problem if you are a local and come there many times, but for first time visitors a bit frustrating. Usually they give you a flyer and you have to choose from that.After choosing and paying, you have to wait until a masseuse is available. This usually takes 10-20minutes. There is a large waiting room with sofa's and some magazines and water.Once in the room, it gets a bit more zen, with nice, clean rooms. Nothing fancy design-wise, just typical spa room with a shower.I usually take either aroma therapy or Thai massage. Price for 1h30 aroma therapy is 850THB. The price for 2hrs Thai massage is 450THB.If you just want a quick massage, without the feeling zen and relaxing atmosphere, Health Land is ok at a reasonable value for money.However, for a real total, relaxing spa experience, there are better alternatives, which not make you feel like a number and with a much more personal approach."

It was huge, it was packed and people were just being processed like on a plant production line without much care. Our room was nice and clean but very noisy. Our masseuses just below average. I would not recommend this place."

I went to the one at sukhumvit soi 31 by taxi, it's a little bit deep into the lane if you are not sure about the location pls call the receptionist and let them tell the driver. Usually a free shuttle bus is available between BTS phrongphrom station and oasis, make sure you book it on the phone with the receptionist forehead and if they can't arrange you the shuttle bus then they will pay for the taxi fee( just between phrongphrom station and oasis)."

Unfortunately the girl was not attentive at all, she didn't bring any pain relief, she didnt pay attention to the places I asked during massage (( she stepped by her knee or ankle on my ear(!), she draw out some hair (!) - it was one of the worst experiences of massage in my life. Be attentive what specialist will make massage for you."

I had a special 4.5 hour package last year as a gift from my friend - I know this was expensive and I really appreciated the generosity and the thought of being pampered for half a day.Although the location is good, relaxing and tranquil, I was surprised that they do not offer Male Therapists. For such an expensive and \"professional\" spa, they only have female.The lady was very sweet and she did do a good job. But I just do not like to be touched by a lady as I feel uncomfortable - this is not sexist or sexual, its just a personal preference to have a male therapist.I was really surprised that my friend got me ANOTHER package as a gift - being one year later, I was hoping they had got some male therapists. On their websites FAQ it even says \"Do you have male therapists\" as one of the FAQ's, so as a frequent request one would assume that this company would invest in a male therapist to float between the two locations in Bangkok - But no, they have ONE male therapist in Phuket only?!With 1,000's of massage spa's on Bangkok alone that 99% offer a male therapist, its very disappointing that this place cannot do the same, however its not a problem as I will go to a competitor that can cater for my request instead."

I can say it is money worth as it includes couple of things, steam, bath, 4 hands massage, scrub, body wrab and facial.What goes wrong is the 4 hands massage, the pressure is different between the left and right side, it will keep your brain busy thinking that's a bad choice taking the 4 hands massage.One slight matter is the room or the products didn't carry spa smell, a medium helps to relax. When you take a deep breath, you can only get a normal air smell.Oversall it is a so so experience, I didnt have the urge for my next visit."

I don't have a lot of experience with spas - the odd massage or facial every other year or so - so decided to treat myself to the 4 hour paradise of oasis package while taking a long weekend in bangkok. So glad I did! It was amazing from the lemongrass steam to the cucumber infused facial at the end. Property was serene and room was simple but clean and and inviting. I left feeling refreshed and pampered and would highly recommend to anyone. Cost was totally reasonable - especially if you are used to prices in the west."

This is not our first time to The Oasis Spa in Bangkok, and it certainly will not be our last. The atmosphere is beautiful, calm and relaxing. From the moment you arrive, you know that this is not just a run of the mill experience. Firstly, you are presented with chilled hand towels to refresh yourself, followed by a lovely cup of chilled tea, served in beautiful china cups. Then, you fill out a very detailed health form, so that the therapists can treat you accordingly. The receptionist spoke very good english and, as we had already filled out the forms with specific information; for instance, my husband has arthritis in his hands and so he requested that \"his hands not be touched\"; she did not forget and she never touched his hands. We then changed into the packaged intimates and went onto the massage tables, which were covered in clean, white, cotton linens, as well as some orchid blossoms. Both of our masseuses, understood and spoke some english, and regularly asked if the pressure was ok for us. After our massages, we took showers (we chose to shower together, as the shower in the double massage room is extremely large and had dual controls and shower heads). There is a wardrobe to store your clothes and bags during your treatment, and another lockable safe to store your valuables.We then filled out our assessment of our treatment and enjoyed another cup of tea, this time, hot tea, and again, served in beautiful china cups.You would be hard pressed to find a better and more luxurious spa treatment, not just in Bangkok, but virtually anywhere in the world....indulge yourself - you deserve it!"

Of all the massages I had in Bangkok, I would say this one was just okay. For instance, every other masseuse knew about my back pain without me having to say anything, and they concentrated on that area. However, my masseuse didn't seem aware and kept asking, \"which area?\" It was okay, just different from the other places. All in all, I got a great two-hour spa service for 2K Baht (expensive spa prices), but I enjoyed myself greatly and I would go back if I have the chance."

I told to the masseuse more than 2 times, but she just said \"sorry\" to me and the oil was still hot. After all I felt like I'm almost burned, so stopped the massage, and got out of the room. The staff says \"Few customers reacted like you. Originally this massage uses warm oil. Your skin is sensetive.\" Oasis spa keep saying their massage hasn't any problem!

The entire experience was top notch beginning as soon as we walked in the door. Everything smelled fresh and wonderful, we were given cool towels and delicious beverages while we filled out the very thorough paperwork. We had a couples room which was elegant and clean, it was upstairs and we walked through a lovely courtyard to get there. Our entire treatment lasted around 3 hours and was the most relaxing experience and everything was very professional. This seems to be a very popular spa, there even appeared to be a celebrity of someone of royalty there that day, or perhaps a photo shoot of some sort as there were what looked to be security and cameras all around. The spa was an excellent choice and I would certainly recommend it and go back myself."

I had the hot oil head massage and a full body massage. Two hours of complete relaxation and pampering. The attention to detail in the spa is astounding. The outdoor shower amongst green foliage continues to tantalize the sense. Delicious essence of shower gel and shampoo. There's a little box with all the simple grooming amenities you would need which I just loved...and your masseuse brings you a hair dryer. Fabulous!!!!!"

A friend came with me full of anticipation for a beautiful and deeply relaxing afternoon. We booked the longest massage on the menu - five hours. We felt tired, jet lagged and very much in need of a peaceful time. At the beginning all was as I remembered and as it should be - forms filled and lovely tea presented... but I felt things went pear-shaped the moment we were shown to our room. Coming in from the heat outside we were instructed to get in to the steam room and stay there for 30 minutes - then followed a complicated series of procedures including a scrub, a wrap, five showers in chilly water and a bath. This sounds fine but we were left for long periods of time and every procedure felt it was being conducted in a perfunctory and half-hearted way. When we were told to get into the bath the women said they'd be back in 30 min... having been already left for various periods of time and feeling waterlogged, I said 'that's too long' as 10min in the bath would be quite sufficient. But we weren't the ones calling the shots. At the end of that period of 30 min we were told to have another shower - crazy. Finally, three hours after we'd arrived, the massage began and aspects of it were good but there were several unexplained absences from the room and pauses and I felt the masseuse couldn't really be bothered with what she was doing which is a terrible thing to feel when one is paying $757NZD for two. As nothing was prepared prior to our entrance to the room, there seemed to be constant laundering and running of taps right behind my head. We both sensed our masseuses watching the clock waiting until they could leave and get on with their day. Something weird happened to my foot during the massage and I found I could hardly put any weight on it when I stepped down from the massage table. It was excruciating. No attention was paid to my discomfort. We paid, left and felt bewildered."

This lovely spa hits all the right notes as to image: beautiful garden, very clean, well decorated rooms, friendly staff. The website is stellar. The location is good. The other Tripadvisor reviews are very convincing. Where it is massively disappointing- and I say that only because you can get exceptional massages in Bangkok for a fraction of the price- is in the actual SPA treatments, which should really be the star of the show. I had the Lanna experience and had a mediocre scrub, a less than average massage and a poor facial. Not once was I asked what skin type I have or what aromatherapy oils I prefer. However, I was reminded about 5 or 6 times that I must change treatment rooms because I presume one of the steam rooms was out of order and there were other people wanting the same treatment. Maybe I just got the trainee, but it does jar. The polyester satin robes I would lose, very fast. An honest opinion? I would say save your money, go and have an out of this world massage at Wat Po. Then again, if you adore open air showers, rituals, prettily arranged towels and free fruit skewers, this is the place for you."

You can easily get cheaper massages at the numerous storefronts everywhere in Bangkok, but if you want a true spa experience, I highly recommend this place."

I had a Thai Massage and coffee body scrub and both were fabulously relaxing. The spa staff are very kind and professional, paying great attention to detail. Upon arrival, I was greeted with some lovely ginger tea and the same after my treatments concluded. The spa has such a nice relaxing atmosphere, my only regret is that I didn't stay longer! Will definitely be back next my next time in Bangkok."

Took a taxi to go there but the driver was suffering to find a right location though I provided an address. Perhaps you'd better to ask the spa about their pick-up service. In my case I used it to return to my hotel in Sukhumbit area and it was free. Not sure how far they cover, though. Regarding massage I was satisfied with both the skill of the therapist and the environment of the room. All required facilities were rightly prepared in the room and everything was clean. You can enjoy 20% discount if you book online for the morning time massage. Check their website."

I particularly enjoyed the changes in the aromas used throughout the massage as it added to sensory enjoyment. The outside grounds are beautiful and the rooms are very 'spa like' and comfortable. The only reason that I did not rate it 5 stars is because several of the spa's buildings lost power while I was there and they could not process my credit card for payment. They drove me to an ATM so that I could withdraw money to pay (which I did not mind at all) but they did not offer to reimburse me for the very high ATM fee that I incurred. If I could rate the spa a 4.5, I would!"

Only thing a bit odd was that the toilet had no door! The body scrub and wrap was well timed and very soothing. Really appreciated the break halfway through with tea and fruits. Massage and facial was also really relaxing. Our therapists were attentive and we left feeling blissful.Must also say that the service at Oasis Spa is fantastic, the pick up from BTS station was really efficient. When their driver got stuck in traffic they arranged a taxi for us after our treatment which we didn't expect at all. Will definitely visit again next time I'm in Bangkok!"

I really like clean above all~The Oasis Four Hands Massage is absolutely such an experience to take in from the welcome at the door till you get to the room the anticipation builds up. I was a bit shocked at first then relieved because I thought there wasn't any shower from I stood till I realize OMG it was a full outdoor rain shower. Then I thought to myself why was the bath towel so far away inside the air-conditioned room till I noticed the towel was actually right there at eye level next to the rain shower. Just 1 BIG Thing the Shower Gel has some gold specks in every pump soooo cool!~Once I lie down and they started to lay their hands on from end to end the coordination ....I cannot help feeling these folks really got their technique together ...simply an amazing massage. Now if they get an 8 hands I'll take that x2~My next one Aromatherapy Hot Oil Massage just ain't no comparison, it was tres fantstique but after the 4 hands setup, there is no way anything comparesI only wished I'd arranged for a half day instead of just 2 hours!8 STARS"

Both of us faces are pretty sensitive, so we got more time spend in scrub and oil massage instead of face pampering.The massage room was traditional and clean, quite atmosphere with meditation music and has got private outdoor shower space. The out door shower space was too hot. We were in sweat after shower. For me massage was very satisfied, but my sister said her massager didn't put any pressure, just rub with oil for whole hours. She tried to ask more pressure, but the massager didn't speak English.Overall, not good value of money.

However, if you're after an experience, this place should be on your list. I've been to Bangkok several times before and gone to other establishments in this price range, but none of them provided the same caliber of experience.It's important to note that there are two Bangkok locations. The one I visited had a quiet but sophisticated garden atmosphere. The d\u00e9cor had a simple elegance to it that I quite liked, and the private treatment rooms were very comfortable. With individual entries situated around the garden, it feels like a private caba\u00f1a. Perhaps this is what makes it feel so exclusive. At the back of my treatment room was an area with a shower, sauna, and toilet; this space was walled off but not fully roofed in so you could have the pleasure of showering under the sun while maintaining privacy. Their treatment products are from the KIN line and seemed just fine. I booked a Hair Spa Package treatment, and I have to say that my hair felt a lot better afterward (and I've been giving it far too much sun in the last couple of weeks). The head massage that came with this treatment was superb -- I caught myself falling asleep multiple times, but the body scrub and full body massage included in the package were also wonderful. I should note that at the time I made my booking Oasis had a deal running with a 20% discount for booking via their website -- I don't know if that's a regular thing or a current special. Also note that a service charge is included in the bill. Free pick up from and drop off to Phrom Phong BTS station via van is available. Every member of the staff from the shuttle driver to reception to the masseuse were delightful, warm and welcoming but very professional.When I visit Bangkok, I try to squeeze in as many massages as possible, though most of these are at much smaller places where the treatments tend to be in the 200 - 400 baht range. However, I always make time for one special package at a place where I really feel pampered. I've had lovely experiences at different places around the city, but it's hard to imagine going anywhere else now when I'm looking for something extra with my treatments."

We really wanted to try different things but we were also afraid a very traditional Thai massage would hurt a lot. So we have chosen Oasis Spa because it offers a package called Lanna Style which includes a mix of Thai massage, herbal compress and aromatherapy oil massage, basically, a bit of everything.Upon arrival, we immediately checked with the staff if the Thai massage in the package would be very strong, and were assured that it would just be enough to warm our body up. The welcoming tea was hot and soothing, with a hint of ginger as I remembered. The interior looks gorgeous, feels like a classy spa parlour (yes to us the environment and cleanliness count). We had a very quiet room for ourselves. Beneath the holes of the massage beds (where our heads were resting) there were 2 pots of water with lovely floating flowers. Incense or oil were burnt and a calming melody was being played throughout our session, together with the warm and skilled hands of the masseurs both my husband and I were sent to heaven.I also love the attention to little details here and there, such as clean and dry towels kept being replaced everything after we took showers. The pots of flowers beneath the beds (as mentioned), etc. Both our masseurs were very attentive. I took one star off because the outdoor toilet and bathtub aren't very clean or well maintained. They are charming as they are outdoor but this may cause them much quicker wear and tear. There are cracks in the bathtub and the toilet seat was yellowish. Again I think this may be because of the weather.When we were being rubbed like 2 pieces of happy bread dough we felt like we were floating in the air, between the border of consciousness and unconsciousness. This surreal feeling continued even after we left the spa. We slept really well that night. Would recommend this to my friend and other travellers."

My wife and I booked a three and a half hour couples package at their Sukhumvit 31 premises. Even though we were early for our appointment, we were made welcome at reception. We were offered tea and, later, fruit, while the details of our package were explained to us. When our room was ready, we were escorted there and introduced to Navee and New, our masseuses. The treatment was all that it was described, and more: the Body Scrub, the Aromatherapy Hot Oil Massage, the Thai Herbal Hot Compress Massage and the Thai Facial left us relaxed and rejuvenated. The treatment was conducted in a serene and respectful manner, with each masseuse making sure that both my wife and I were comfortable and relaxed. There was no feeling that we being rushed and, in fact, time seemed to stand still. We were surprised, and sorry, when it ended. The whole experience was very worthwhile. When it was over, we were offered transportation back to our hotel and there was no objection to our request to take us to a nearby Thai Restaurant instead. We were treated to wonderful customer service by all the staff at Oasis Spa. We have no hesitation in recommending Oasis Spa and we will certainly return."

I came here with & through the introduction and arrangement of my colleagues, when I got there it was like, wow...the building/decorations/atmosphere is fantastic, so soothing and serene. We arranged a pick up just outside of a BTS station and was brought inside, we were surprised to find a staff who could speak Mandarin(our native language-so we immediately felt more at ease) , as we stepped inside there's a relaxing smell (message oil and incense I suppose)The people there were kind, service was great and it was quiet all around, I felt very calm and secluded. We chose a 2 hour programme with Thai herbs (hot on the skin but comfortable!) Most of my colleagues fell asleep and I just barely managed to stay awake during the programme, the smell and everything was just perfect!Only that I'm personally more sensitive, I feel that some touches were a bit sore/too hard for me, but I thought it probably would be more effective that way so I went with it all the way. I suggest people who don't like it that hard/don't message often, can tell them to go softer when messaging -actually they give you a form to fill out before they start, one of the questions being \"how would you like your message, soft, normal or extra hard\"- and I chose normal. I will recommend a person sensitive to touch like me, to choose the \"soft\".They're a bit different from what I had in Cambodia but quite similar. Compared to what I experienced elsewhere, the level of the message, I would say first class (so says my colleague), but the message itself might not necessarily the best I had, what really took the cake was the atmosphere and the setting(the hot Thai herbs too- I really LOVED that) This place is not a message house with lost of people lying in a row so just the atmosphere was way better.And I really like this tea they gave you before and after your message. One was sweet and cool and the other hot and warming. I actually wished that I could stay there the whole day and relax when I finished the programme. They also sell their message products there, which looked really nice and tempting, but I don't really know how to use it if I bought it home, and things like those are usually not cheap(by experience), so I didn't even check the price. But people who are interested should really stop and take a look if you're not in a hurry to leave! (Some of my colleagues bought things, and one of them who was interested but didn't buy-forgot why, maybe coz we were leaving- and was quite regretful afterwards) Really recommend it."

The spa tucked deep in the the street, so it's nice and quiet. We had arranged the pick up at Prom Prong station and the driver was there waiting. We booked a couple spa package, four hours of \"Paradise of Oasis\" and that was a wonderful and relaxing experience. Booked it on line for the morning session and got a 30% discount.

One of my visitors wanted to try 4-hand massage and this is one of the only few places offering it. We booked online (although I live here) and settled with the early bird promotion at 30% discount having our massages at 10 am in the morning. The service from the reception to our masseurs has been very good. The facility looked spaceous and it is tranquil although it is located on Sukhumvit 31. My gf and I shared a couple's room and it was nicely decorated in Thai style. My masseurs doing the 4-hand were in sync with each other from movement to pressure applied through the body. Incredible. This was better than the one I had a year ago at another spa. The 2 hr. massage also included a hair treatment and foot massage. The foot massage was good. The hair spa was enjoyable but I did not enjoy having my hair and scalp wet wrapped in a towel for 2 hours. The hair spa also included a 15 min or so facial. The least enjoyable part was the after massage shower. The massage was outdoor (and so is the toilet), and the sink and mirror and hair dryer etc are all located outdoor by the shower. It is very inconvenient because it is impossible for two of us to get ready at the same time. So I had to shower first, then wait for my gf to shower, changed back to my street clothes indoor, then go outside to dry my hair. They should have had the vanity set inside the room. There is no mirror inside the room. What if it rains? It is very dangerous havineg a hair dry on top of the sink. They did not provide us with any face cream etc and our face felt so dry after the facial. The lack of personal touch in the arrangement really threw us off. I think if they can improve this set up, they can help retain more customers!"

There are tons and tons of massage places in Bangkok just off the street for $10 but this is a unique experience where you will spend more than that for such a unique experience such as this. I did the \"King of Oasis\" treatment (2 hours) mainly tailored for men for strong muscle massage, hot compresses/oil along muscles. I am always amazed at the professional trained Thai women being so small that they are so very strong and powerful. I am 220 lbs at 6\"2' and after 20 minutes of massaging my wife, I get tired. These Thai women must have the Energizer Bunny for a relative because they are just as strong and powerful as when they start as 2 min before the 2 hours is up.I'm not a pansy or \"metro sexual\" guy at all and my job is very physical and testosterone filled but in all the materials that they use for the building and rooms and how the grounds are kept really sets the mood for the place. I wish I had a beach house somewhere in the world exactly like this place. I am amazed at how each room has been set up right down to the quality of the linens. You are guided to your private room and the masseuse waits quietly outside the door. There is an in room bathroom for you to quickly tidy up and shower down (this is Thailand with 300% humidity, people sweat even walking to this place :) You ready yourself on the table and call her in. The Thai women are fantastic in knowing every muscle and how to work it gently to the most relaxed state. When ever I go to Bangkok, I schedule my flight in 1 day early and book my 2 hour appt. via the internet. Reception speaks 5 languages. I think next time I will book for when I arrive and when I leave a week later. It is far too long between visits and I deserve this. This place is true class."

The grounds and service in this place are stellar but the massage was a joke. It was like I paid someone to rub oil on me for 2 hours. I did not feel massaged at the end of the stay. When I complained at the end of the session the person told me I had chosen the wrong massage! Clearly the person I was assigned to was brand new and inexperienced. Not what I was expecting. When I pay top dollar I want someone fully trained and experienced. I would stick with the cheaper massages. At least you are only out 10 bucks if it is not good."

I was introduced to this spa by an online spa review \"magazine\" of Bangkok as Oasis Spa came highly recommended (it's won the tourism board award it seems). True enough, it was a pleasant experience and this is as good as any city spa can get. It was an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Bangkok. Absolutely beautiful grounds. And it's popular with the local rich as well who drove in with their beemers and mercedes. Always a good sign. It was one of those splurge trips. As there're a few of us, and since I was paying, I did try to negotiate for a better deal. And you should too. Got to speak to the manager beforehand, and I was offered a 15% discount off the package price. Else, the reception will offer the customary 500baht discount , regardless of the service you chose and we were having one of the most expensive 4hr spa packages!.I chose the Lanna Explorer which included their King of Oasis signature massage done in the privacy of an exclusive room with an attached open-air shower and bath. The masseuse was attentive and skilled. Had I not been doing Thai massage regularly back home, i would have been totally wowed by the massage skills, but since I'm used to this kind of massage, there're certain parts where it could have been better, while other parts were good. It finished with a refreshing honey/cucumber facial and a head massage. Would I come back again? Maybe for the 1.5hr massage instead of the spa package. But then I am very tempted to try other spas as well, just to compare."

It was very relaxing and therapeutic. The spa has a very relaxing ambience. Everything about my experience is rated excellent, from online reservation, reception, and the massage itself. It was one of the highlights of my trip.I will definitely recommend the spa to everyone going to Bangkok and will visit again if I have the opportunity to go to Bangkok once again."

            "review": "Amazing spa in this amazing city. My wife and I visited the Dahra Spa on Sukhumvit for the second time in a year for a series of four two hour massages. It was even better the second time around. From the moment you step inside there is a wonderful serenity from the chaotic but brilliant city outside. The massage rooms themselves are in fantastic condition with each one having its own private shower,and washbasin, dimmable lighting, serene music and a lovely private large room rather than being crammed in together. The best thing of all though is the quality of the staff. whilst you choose the style of massage you want, it is brilliant that the therapists without prompting will vary the massage to suit the individual, and work on any areas that they identify need to be worked on. each of our four massages were slightly different as a result, which inexperienced therapists you find in many of the Bangkok spa's are not skilled enough to do.so good were the therapists that Katty who looked after my wife in in her wordlwide top three, and Ya who looked after me is in my top two!The one thing that you may need to know is how to get there if you are not staying close by. We stayed a few miles away but used the skytrain to get there which is super easy. If you are coming from the direction of Siam (the main shopping area) on the skytrain, just go to the Assok station and exit to be on the opposite side of the road from Terminal 21, (the superb shopping mall adjoining this station). Then walk in the same direction as the train was travelling for about 250m, and you will find the Dahra spa.It might sound a bit complicated, but this spa has not got all the rave reviews for nothing, and it really is easy to find. already planning our next trip back it is so good!!"

Tea was served and we were asked to change into the slippers provided. Shortly after, we were led upstairs to the rooms. The room was really clean, nice, spacious yet cozy with a shower inside. I really enjoyed my green tea scrub, honey milk wrap and green tea facial. it was supposed to be a 3 hour 45 mins session but it lasted about 4.5 hours. the massage was good and very comfortable, it wasn't too painful nor too soft. My face also feels smoother (and whiter) after the facial! Would definitely recommend this place and I would definitely be back."

When we went there, we waited for awhile as some of their Massage Therapists were ill and they are short of manpower. But time wasn't wasted as they introduced and explained to us the types of treatment which enable us to understand and choose the correct type of treatment we wanted. We went for their Deluxe Spa Treatment and Herbal Massage. It was a brand new experience and it was fantastic. The massage was good, hard, Therapists were friendly and professional, environment was quiet and relaxing. During my stay, I also visited Healthland. In my opinion, i prefer Dahra over Healthland. Both the massage was fantastic but Healthland is very crowded which seems rushing. whereas Dahra, the place is not crowded which allow me to really enjoy the massage. Best of all if you book online with Dahra, you can enjoy the massage at a discounted rate! Definitely will visit Dahra again in my next trip. If you are staying in Dahra, do consider it. They have2 branch, 1 at Silom another at Sukhumvit. For more information you can visit their website."

If you reserve via online, you save at least 20% off their rates.My wife had the head, neck and shoulders massage, plus the mani/pedi. I selected a package which included a body scrub and wrap plus aromatherapy massage, which had a 50% discount at the time. Amazing!!The staff were professional and the place leaves you with a sense of calm as soon as you enter. Very clean and well appointed. We were so glad we chose to treat ourselves here!"

We were greeted with a warm welcome and the enchanting smells of the various salts/oils used (presumably) in their aroma treatments. We waited for our therapists at a grand dining table. Our massage began with a footwash before we lay down on our massage beds upstairs. It was exquisite! My therapist traced kinks and chronic sore spots on my back down to my toes and worked them out in my shoulders and neck. My partner's treatment was also customised for his various ailments/ At one point my therapist was working out knots with on her toes and guiding my body into full body stretches. Working out the knots can be a bit painful but my therapist was receptive to my pain threshold. This is a new location for a reputable spa and I urge anyone in the area to go for a visit."

The facilities are better than many of the spas I've seen in the UK and the treatment was incredible value for money. If you book the package online before the end of Feb 2016, you can get it for 50% off! Apparently the Sukhumvit branch is the slightly newer of the two so head there."

Reservation was hassle-free, was 30mins early for the appointment, however everything was arrange nicely, did not have to wait for the time of reservation. The staffs are excellent in terms of skills and service, do not talk to each other during massage. Mine even went to ask the customer next door to silent his phone as it was constantly ringing loudly. The price is mid range, however you get a first class service and totally worth the time travelling there."

The smell, the cleanliness, the decor was enough for me to be relaxed from the moment I walked in. Considering the spa is on a very busy road I heard nothing in the room. The spa room was simple but extremely clean and well kept. The booked a deluxe spa treatment for 2 100b. The massage was on the lighter side as most aromatherapy ones are but the therapists hands and skills were very much stand out to me. Very well looked after and I will go back probably in the next week! Easy to find as well, but if you want to save some money book online as they fantastic online promotions. Khopkunka :)"

As this was our first massage we did not have any idea what kind of massage will relax our mind and body.As we had limited time they suggested to have Aromatherapy.We can choose the oil for our massage.The most what i liked is they offer different kind of rooms including couple room.Whole spa is very clam and pleasant.The massage is for 1 hour and it was very relaxing and mind blowing.If I ever visit Bangkok i would definitely visit DAHRA again...worth the visit."

You will come out looking refreshed and glowing!The location was perfect, as it was opposite our hotel, but its very close to 2 MRT stops including Ashok, which makes it a perfect central location. There are many shops, restaurants and bars located next to the Spa. Choose this spa, if you looking for a professional, quality service with value for money. Would return again."

Bangkok,like so many places in Thailand has so many places to have a massage it is difficult to know where to go, or who to trust to avoid disappointment. My wife and I were looking for a clean, modern spa which offers privacy and also properly qualified staff who know what they are doing!We had a recommendation to use the Dahra from one of the leading guided tour operators in Bangkok, and the Dahra ticked all the boxes. It is easily found in a good location on the Sukhumvit Road near the holiday inn, and is only 100m from a skytrain stop (Asok), and is also easily walkable from Terminal 21 shopping mall which my wife loved!The Spa itself is new, so in great condition with air con and good quality massage tables in private rooms for comfort. However, the best thing about it is the quality of the staff. We visited twice for 2 hour massages and these were exceptional, delivered by qualified therapists Taeng and Katty. We have been fortunate to enjoy great massages in many places in the world, and these two masseurs are now in our top five! We would go back in an instant next time we are in Bangkok.This is not for those wanting a cheap massage, because it is not aiming at those clients. However, neither is it hugely expensive by Bangkok standards, coming in competitively against the hotel spa's, whilst beating them on the quality of the staff and the great environment and experience that it provides.Thanks Taeng and Katty for the professional experience you provide, and for anyone like us who is bamboozled by the choice of spa's available, be sure you will love the Dhara!"

What touched me really was, i found out that she helps by hiring the native tribe from Myanmar for job.they live in mountains with not much opportunity for income. So giving this girls some extra tip is really helpful for them. Eventhough the masseurs from Myanmar cannot speak Thai or English, they give you a warm smile, and Yuko was there to assist, and Yuko can speak the tribe dialect! Really amazing. I am really happy for my fellow Japanese doung great in foreign country. After our massage, Yuko invited us for her own prepared snacks and fruits! And even gave us Her handmade products as souvenir for free!! And also, she will give you tips on where to go and what to see in Bangkok. She can also guide and go with you if you want to feel like a local only for an extra massage more! No tour guide fee! I will definitely come back here next time. And recommend to everybody."

I live in Tokyo and was surprised to see a Japanese person running a massage shop in the middle of Bangkok, so I went for a visit.Yuko is an awesome person to talk to, really funny and very kind. She also gave me the best Mango I've ever eaten in my entire life!! Spa Yuko is worth going JUST for the Mango!!The massage was also very good, although not quite as good as the Spa I had been the day before, but that spa is supposedly the best or 2nd best spa in Bangkok, so that was to be expected. Yuki more than makes up for it with hospitality and delicious Mango though. As I said, it's worth going just for the delicious Mango!!"

Location is about 5~6minutes walk from MRT Phra Ram 9(MRT) \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e21 9(\u0e23\u0e16\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e43\u0e15\u0e49\u0e14\u0e34\u0e19) station. MRT and BTS is very convenient to transfer. How to get there is from Phra Ram 9, walk towards the bridge and turn right at the signal along the Hotel Grand Mecure Fortune, and you will see SevenEleven, turn right at the corner. You will see very lively street with restrants, shops and markets. Spa Yuko is on that street, you will find it soon.Be careful about the taxi, many taxi drivers say that they cannnot find the place or they know nicer massage shop, and try to take you to other place. Because they want get the commission from those shops. The location is about behind Hotel Grand Mercure Fortune, and near Seven Eleven. Yuko, a Japanese lady/Manager is very kind lady, please enjoy the massage and her warm hospitality."

We both got the same treatment from how they washed your feet to folding the towel to dry them. We also requested specialized areas so that added a bonus of customization.

I requested in advance for a couples room which was awesome. Had a bathtub, shower and toilet in that room. The room aroma was very relaxing but the only one thing is the music was quite loud at one point. My masseur was super professional and I had some amazing stretches. Then afterwards it was followed by the foot massage . We could just lay down in bed without moving to have the foot massage. The only suggestion is maybe the massage lady could have informed me that she was going to use a stick ish to stimulate the circulation of my feet. It was a bit itchy for some spots. I guess it was a typical foot massage in Thailand. Overall with the price I paid for it did indeed meet my expectation. Probably we would be charged double the price in HK. Keep up the good work!"

Apparently, the massage standard varies among different masseuses.Moreover, the decoration or the room facilities are a bit dated. my husband and my son's treatment room even has stains on the linen. My room, though small with a bit dated decor, is good enough for me.The other thing that adversely affects the overall ambience is construction site just opposite to the spa. However, it's beyond factor the control of the spa. Hope that the building will be finished soon.Despite the above, we still found the experience pleasant. The massage oil is exceptional and the fragrance on my body after treatment lasted for over 5 hours, which makes Divana stand out from the other spas of similar setting and level.The Receptionist is great and accommodating. They can prolong the treatment time at a charge (other than the time shown in the program menu) so that my family of 3, though choosing 3 different treatments, could start and end at the same time.Divana is definitely a safe choice if you are clueless about what to choose among the large no. of spas and massage parlours in Bangkok."

It was so extremely relaxing that the time flew by, probably because I dozed off almost immediately when the massage started.Afterwards the ladies will wait outside while you compose yourself and come out of the massage zone and then they escort you downstairs for a fruit snack and lemongrass drink.What I like about this spa is the atmosphere - half of a good massage is the ambiance and the zen feeling of being in a spa as well as the scents and the aromas floating around.Then also the attention to detail and customer satisfaction and convenience is something to experience and behold. I have been to countless spas and massage places in Bangkok - but this one is definitely my all time favorite because everything that happens and takes place here is done with the customer in mind and to make sure that they have the best and most relaxing experience as possible.Highly recommended!"

Started with a foot soak and the skill of the therapist was great she concentrated on the areas requested. To finish up you are given pineapple, banana and some tea that is also nicely presented. Surroundings were very relaxing. The massage is on the more expensive side for Thailand but you could not get the same service in Australia for this price. Had a small issue at the end as they wanted my signature for credit card despite the receipt clearly indicating this was not required. Perhaps local policy for their site but not needed for them to receive payment and made me a bit suspicious when they kept pushing especially when their is no place in the receipt designated for a signature."

The room's spacious environment with a view of nature outside was what i liked most.Things to improve:1. I hope therapist can keep the customer informed of what she is going to do next.2. Add some background music. 3. Therapists should not leave the room for longer than 5 minutes during the spa.4. Allow the customers to choose their preferred massage oil and body scrub. I have never been asked about that.5. Steaming time and bathing time should be limited to not more than 15 min each. I guess most customers just want more massage time. 6. The bed had better have a hole for people lying face down to breathe. Either my neck or my chin was feeling uncomfortable when i lied face down.7. The stones for massage might be a little too hot. I am not sure if it is the hotter the better?"

I did a walk in on a Friday afternoon without any reservation and luckily one guest did not turn up so I managed to try the Spa Sensational treatment. Dont try this as the spa is always fully booked, please make a reservation if you do not wish to be disappointed. The 130min treatment included a thorough foot soak, a mixed berry scrub and an eculyptus aromatherapy massage. The scrub was very nice smelling, I felt like I was some toast and had berry jam all over me. After a shower in this lovely wooden tub my skin felt very smooth. I believed I fell asleep during the massage, Sung the therapist was strong but not painful. Ended with a lovely snack of pineapple and banana served with their post treatment tea. I love the spa which is part of an old Thai house. Very atmospheric with a pretty garden."

The staff at all times were courteous. My husband and I had the couples room and what I really appreciated, that while giving us the treatments, there was no talking to each other.The music was soft and soothing, enough to make you fall asleep.We were served with fruit and a drink after the massage.I purchased some of there products while there.When we go back to Bangkok, I will make a point of going back for another massage or two."

After our massage we were served lemongrass tea and fresh mango with coconut sticky rice.This place really is a peaceful oasis set back from bustling Sukhumvit Rd. We went at night and the garden outside was beautiful. It was just what we needed after a long flight and first day of sightseeing in Bangkok.I went with a friend but I would highly recommend Divina for couples or for a day of solo pampering.

On arrival we were greeted and each given a cold towel and chilled lemongrass tea, which was refreshing after wandering down Sukhumvit Road in the Bangkok heat (though the spa is a short walk from the Asok sky train station). When the room is ready you're introduced to your masseurs who present you with the clothes to change into (they are like huge pyjamas) - there is also a safe in the room to store your belongings. The Thai massage begins with a foot soak which felt wonderful, and which I think also lulled me into a false sense of calm before the massage commenced! They do ask you prior to the massage what level of pressure you like (soft, medium, strong) and if there was any area you wanted them to concentrate on. I opted for medium, which 95% of the time felt good - my masseur really knew how to work my muscles. The facial afterwards was a great way to follow up the massage, and the scents of the products used were really pleasant. I was so relaxed during this that I fell asleep for a while - I think the ambiance of the room, the music playing and the sound of the thunderstorm outside all helped! Once your session is complete you're led out to the main reception area where they give you a small snack of mango and sweet sticky rice. We weren't too keen to rush outside as the rain storm was in full swing but decided to \"make a run for it\" - one of the staff led us outside, giving us one of their umbrellas to walk back through the garden to the street - we got outside and asked if we needed to it back - she replied \"I give to you\". Such good service and a really great way to end our time there."

Here's my verdict:Divana Massage is amazing if you are seeking for a relaxing ambiance. I got the couple Siamese massage with my girlfriend and was truly amazed with their service. We were greeted with Thai herbal tea and was asked how we liked our massage; soft or medium. We chose medium. We were directed to our own private room to change. The room is clean and has a great decor. The music was relaxing and our masseuses were polite and accommodating.Now on to the massage, the massage was *drum roll* okay. I felt that was it softer than expected. It could be because I'm a guy so I didn't feel much pressure. After the massage, Divana treated us with mango and sticky rice.Now onto health land. I tried to book an appointment with health land over the phone and can agree with past tripadvisor's reviews, they're a bit rude and rushy. I decided to give them a try anyway. My girlfriend and I made an appointment but were late due to the sheer madness that is called bangkok traffic. Upon checking in, they told us that our appointments were no longer valid because we were 20 minutes late. They asked us to wait along with several other people for an hour. We both chose the Thai massage and were directed to our own room.How was it? It was long, amazing and painful. If you can take the pain and are looking to get rid of all of your knots, health land is it! In addition, it's only 500 baht for two hours !Health Land:Cleanliness: 8/10Customer service: 6/10Ambiance: 6/10Thai massage: 9/10Pain: 8/10Price: super affordable DivanaCleanliness: 9/10Customer service: 9/10Ambiance: 9/10Thai massage: 6/10Pain: 2/10Price: upscaleOverall, I liked health land a lot more. If you don't mind not having all of the bells and whistles but can take the pain and want all of your knots removed, health land is it. In contrast, if you are seeking for exceptional service and have never had a Thai massage before, Divana is the place to go since Thai massages could be quite painful. "

It was just beautiful and peaceful and very soon the friendly associate came out to greet us and serve wif fresh and tasteful tea and assisted us to chose the oil for the coming treatment. Their service is warm and professional and later we were led to a couple room which is so comfy and the real good spa specialist did their best to provide the extraordinary service to make me feel purified and totally relaxed. it took 2 and a half hours for the treatment and the process was just so detailed and enjoyable that i could not wait to have another trip to Bangkok just for experiencing all of it again.Also the product of Divana is quite famous and good IMO so you could enjoy some discount with it if your package reaches certain amount. Also they have promotion from time to time so just visit their website and print out the promotion page like what i did and enjoy the promoted price or discount on the treatment. It is recommended to book in advance as it is quite full for the spa but me and my boyfriend really love it for its graceful environment, professional service and convenient location."

We booked a different spa everyday of our trip to Bangkok and this spa landed somewhere in the middle of the spas we visited. The grounds and atmosphere are lovely at first glance, but there were random Thai workmen sitting in the garden doing nothing during our wait for the massage which made a strange impression. The bathrooms and facilities could be better maintained at second glance and the room we were in had constant construction noise from outside so they kept turning up the volume of the music in our treatment room which was very annoying! Our 2 ladies who gave us the treatments never smiled and it gave me also a weird feeling that they hated their jobs. The treatments themselves were good, but there is a very limited choice on the menu and for the price, comparing to the experiences we had elsewhere, I would not return in the future."

The exotic atmosphere was very beautiful and attractive. The receptionists and therapist never disappointed me just like the other branch. It's really worth paying money for their quality. Will definitely go back there for the Signature Treatment someday soon!"

Upon arrival, I was served a chilled drink before being brought to one of the private rooms. I had a combination of body scrub, steam bath, oil massage, etc. What I enjoyed the most was the massage - strong enough to my liking! After the spa, I was served a piece of mango. However, I realised that my spa entitled me to a meal, but I didn't get any due to the kitchen wasn't functioning, To make it up, Divana gave me one of their body creams - a good momento, and allows me to continue part of the Divana experience at home."

When you enter the elegant reception area you are greeted with a chilled refreshment towel and offered the extensive Spa menue. Once you have chosen the treatment you require you are asked about the strength of the massage, any medical conditions you may have, any body parts to avoid, and so on. I mostly chose the aromatherapy massage. You have the choice of 4 different kind of oils. Once you are in the massage room and have changed into the underwear provided, your therapist starts with washing your feet, followed by one and a half hours of pure bliss. The first time I enjoyed this massage, I was not sure whether 100 minutes of massage was not too long lying still and so on. When the masseuse announced that she was finished, I only thought please don`t stop. After you are dressed again, you are offerd a refreshment and some fresh fruit.The price of the treatments are not exactly cheap, but you get what you pay for. In my opinion, it is worth every single Baht.P.S. To avoid dissapointment make an reservation."

The spa is close to the Asok BTS station (actually closer than I expected from the map) and easy to find. The garden is a beautiful entry to the small reception area and the welcoming cold towel is great after the muggy Bangkok climate. The receptionist helped us pick out a package (Spa Sensational for 2650 THB per person) and showed us four choices for the body scrub and four choices for the massage oil. We also filled out a small sheet detailing which areas of the body we wanted the masseuse to focus on and which areas we wanted her to avoid during the massage, how hard we wanted the massage to be, etc.We did wait a bit but that was because we were early so our treatment started exactly on time. The treatment room was very nice and well laid out with a seating area for the foot soak, two beds, two urn-like baths (which we didn't use for our program), and a shower, a toilet (both behind glass doors). Outside the window was a water feature and the whole atmosphere was extremely relaxing and luxurious. The treatments were great, unhurried, thorough, professional, discreet. And the therapists followed our focus/avoid directions well. I enjoyed both the scrub and the massage very much. My only complaint (and this is small) is that the shower in the couples treatment room only allows for one person to shower at time, so it delays things a bit. And the silicone probably needs to be redone. But we never felt like we were being rushed. The spa products in the bathroom are quite nice (we didn't purchase any).Fruit and tea were served while our bill was being prepared. Overall we felt like this was a good value. Spas at high-end hotels in Bangkok easily charge double or triple for the same experience and while it may not be the cheapest option in the city, it's not too bad for a once-in-a vacation spa day. Or maybe twice (I think I want to go back later this week) . :-)"

Once we used the bath they would charge as milk bath which price is 800B and now they have already given us discount to 400B. I'd be happy to pay that if I noticed that in advanced but there's no notice in the room or from the staff and we insisted not paying 400B for a bath with water only.

This is the land of the spa. If you are one of those establishments claiming to be high-end then everything has to be on-song, all the time.

I am not going to pass judgement but I will say that my long awaited visit to this establishment was a disappointing experience and even when I (against all my instincts) tried to advise management that the service received was well below expectations all I received was the comforting knowledge that the therapist would be told I was 'not happy'.

There's no doubt that the environment is excellent, and you'd feel relaxed once stepping into the garden and the house of it, yet once I entered the room, the impression was completely altered. Before we arrived, we've reserved a couple room to have the treatment, once we stepped into the room, the receptionist told us the duration of the treatment, and emphasized that once he stepped out the room, they would start counting the time. Well, maybe it's normal as he just simply stated things clear, but as a customer, I felt a bit odd as he seemed pushing us to go on more quickly. The air conditioner was pretty cold, and right on the top of our beds, I was frozen. The skill of massaging of the therapists was ok, yet it can't compensate the hard feeling. They made me have a shower with my partner under one shower, with them outside a semi transparent door witnessing. It's so awkward and making us embarrassed. I guess they should have left the room when we were having a shower instead of standing outside the bathroom to see the naked us. And after finishing the shower, we laid on the bed to continue the massage, at the same time, one of the therapists went washing the shower room. That's so weird as the receptionist counted the time so tightly and precisely, then why they used our treatment time to do cleansing jobs?Once finishing the treatment, we went back to the reception, and it's 15 mins to go before they closed. I asked them for the price list of those spa products. They showed me with a bad manner, so I asked if I could still buy something or they were going to close. Since then, they ignored the questions I raised about the products, especially the senior one. Sigh I paid for relaxing, yet they made me feel bad and irrespective.Truly the products are nice and the environment is good, however, I won't be back to any of the branch, and would suggest my friends not to go."

Very nice environment and nice mango sticky rice after massage.However, massage we had was so so, especially the foot massage. It's not as good as those cheaper massage. We lay down instead of sat on a comfy chair for foot massage. They used some kind of stone to sweep on yr foot. Cannot feel the tension at all. For body, we did not feel have the enjoyable experience as we do normally."

Professional therapist with good care of me and I came out really refreshed and feeling great. Good deal of privacy and room decor matches with the spa tier, and air-con noise was minimal. Welcome tea could be less sweet but I'm ok with that and the mango sticky rice after the spa would delight a lot of people as well."

            "review": "Just average. We went for the 5 hours spa package and ended up somewhat disappointed with the experience. The facility itself was nicely decorated and staffs are friendly. However the treatment itself and and skill of the massuists were nothing but average. They were constantly hushing us to make sure we were ahead of schedule, \"you have 15 minutes shower\" \"10 minutes ma'am\", we did not feel relaxed. The actual massage time was quite short, and the massuists burnt us several times with hot stones. However the fruits, tea, and light meals they served were very nice. Nice ambiance too. So to sum it up, if you want a good, authentic, recovering massage treatment, go somewhere else where they have real professional massuists. If you just want a nicely decorated place with nice ambience and music, you can give this one a try."

But this time I was really disappointed.Location: 4.5/5It is about 5 to 10 mins' walk from the Asok BTS station, and is quite easy to find. Just keep walking with Terminal 21 on your left and turn left when you see the \"glass house\". Can also do shopping before and/or after spa at Terminal 21, a new shopping mall right next to the BTS station.Ambience: 5/5The moment you walk in, you're in another world. It makes you relax instantly. They give you a tasty welcome drink, which is very soothing especially after the walk from the BTS station, and every person that walks in is attended to by the receptionists without delay. Inside, there are aromatic candles all around and there are even flowers inside the sink! And they use their own products too, which is great.Massage: 2.5/5This is where it all went downhill. I chose the 3-hour Spa Elegance package, a total of 3550 baht + tax, and it was totally not worth the price that I paid for. I'm not sure if it was the masseuse or the package itself, but it was definitely not a pleasant experience.My package consisted of:1. A foot scrub that lasted about 5 minutes which was done halfheartedly. The masseuse flopped my feet around.2. A herbal steam that lasted way more than its prescribed 15 minutes. The temperature was 37 degrees Celsius and it felt hot and uncomfortable.3. A body scrub that was not bad. In fact, their olive oil scrub was good.4. An aromatherapy massage that was way too forceful. I chose \"medium pressure\" when the receptionist asked me, but first thing the masseuse did was to kneel on my back. (Yes, she climbed onto the bed and put the weight of her whole body onto my back.) And her hands were stiff and rigid and it felt like she was just slamming pressure into my body. I had to tell her repeatedly that it was \"too strong\" and \"softer please\", but it still felt uncomfortable.5. A rose petal bath that lasted for more than half an hour. I think it was dirty because I later developed rashes and spots over both of my lower legs and my upper arms that night.Overall I was quite disappointed and will not return (at least not to this branch) next time."

Will definitely be back to try their 4hr spa.Only con is that after the scrub, the therapist was doing preparing the massage bed for our next procedure. And the bath area is only separated by a translucent curtain. Will appreciate if the curtain is non seen thru so that will not make our shower awkward. Also we discover that there is a 20% discount if we printed a coupon on their website. We ask them to help us print but hey are not willing. Not too bad in the end we still get 10% off but got to pay in cash only."

The location with all these fabulous reviews is over an hour from our hotel, but there is another location for Divana and it is in Silom district and only two blocks for our hotel. At two p.m. we walked over there to inquire about a reservation for that afternoon. From the moment we entered the door, we felt welcomed as an old friend. The facility is immaculate, the service incredibly attentive and accommodating. We were served a beverage while we reviewed the list of services and told to return at five p.m. for our side by side 100 minutes Thai massage. The massage we each received was excellent. While we settled the bill, we were served a bowl of fresh fruit and lemongrass tea. The cost was $50 each and worth every penny. I hope to return on our next visit to Bangkok."

The area is well known for its Night life but it is little known for the many luxurious day spas located within walking distance in area. During my stay, I visited 5 day spas, Hapa Sap, Urbean Retreat, MySpa, Lavana, and Divana. I\u2019ve chosen Half day or Full Day package (3 to 5 hours). All the spas offered more or less similar treatment and all of them were excellent. However, I would place Divana above the others for its ambient. Divana have created a paradise in the middle of busy Bangkok. Once you step into Divana door, it feels like you stepped in paradise. The first thing I encountered is a lovely garden where I was welcomed by a smiling receptionist that led to the reception area. The reception area is full of tranquility and great smell with comfortable seating. I was offered cold welcome drink and refreshing towel. After selecting treatment package and answering few questions, I was led to my treatment room which was located at the end of magnificent corrode. The treatment room is well decorated, very relaxing and Zen. It had shower, toilet, double beds and double path tubs overlooking bond with water falling from vertical garden creating a truly calming atmosphere. I was offered desert and cold drink half way through the treatment. After finishing my treatment, I was moved to comfortable room and offered organic meal, desert, cold drink and herbal tea. All the spas I visited offered wonderful spa treatments. However, Divana went further and created truly relaxing ambient."

            "review": "Wanted to Love It. Each time I come to Bangkok - I hope and pray that I can find somewhere that I love as much as the transformative experiences that I have have at the hotel that I stay at - the Conrad (at a lower price). Each time, however, I have come away disappointed - and often needing to be \"fixed\" by a massage back at the Conrad. Sadly, this was no exception. I will also preface my review by saying - have you ever wanted to end a massage early? Just get up and leave ... If you know the feeling - then you will be able to relate to my review.I really wanted to love my massage experience here ... But was honestly underwhelmed. The spa itself was about a ten minute walk from BTS. Not overwhelming - or necessarily difficult to find - but simply not an ideal preamble to a luxurious spa experience. I would not recommend that a lady walk out from this spa alone at night time ... By the way. If you go solo (or even in a small group) arrange to be picked up by a taxi on your way home.Even know the spa is down a somewhat gritty alley downtown, the grounds are lush and lovely ... And somewhat reminiscent of visiting the Jim Thompson complex (somewhat). When I arrived at the spa, however, the attendants seemed flustered and a bit unorganized (and not just with me - kind of in general). Its not that the staff wasnt welcoming - but they just dont seem to have the level of training that some spas ensure in their staff. You don't feel the immediate calming scerenity. The two treatments that I thought I had booked on their web were somehow not booked correctly - so they had to scramble to get me a room - or so it seemed. I waited about 20 minutes beyond my reservation for the room. Not a big deal by itself. Make sure that if you want multiple services that you either call directly. The waiting room itself was at times cramped and jostled as customers came and went. The treatment rooms were nice - however and mine had a lovely view. Again thugh, compared to the spa suites at the Conrad - sorry. Tough comparison. The most important thing is always the skill and technique of the masseuse herself. Although pleasant enough in manner (and she was very nice) - her true massage techniques were simply below what I would have expected for a spa of this caliber (and WAY below the Conrad). I am not unfamiliar with Thai massage - by the way - as my regular masseuse in LA is Thai - but there were points in the massage where i simply had to tell the masseuse to stop - because her elbows in my back felt like knives. I also opted for the stone massage there (which i usually love) and at times - the stones were literally scalding. I have to admit - once more - i was kind of dumbfounded that this could even happen at spa ... It just seemed so \"Spa 101\". I was actally kind of stunned. As with many reviews on the Trip Advisor site - the level of competency of the masseuse can vary - and probably can make or break the experience. The best spas - however - seem to draw consistency from their technicians - which can be a huge differentiator when you open your pocketbook to make a spa decision. When they give you your bill, the do give you a lovely dragon fruit snack and hot tea - very nice touch! They also present you with a slip for feedback - which is a conscientious thing to do. Sadly, I lay here this morning with an aching back - and once more can't wait to book an appointment to \"fix\" My ouch-ies. Lesson learned. Sometimes when you only have a short period of time - stick with the tried and true. In the end - it really would have been less expensive. Sorry Divana ... I won't be back."

This is also a well situated spa \u2013 not far from Asoke off of Sukumvit. The facilities were quite nice and as always \u2013 the staff were very welcoming. I loved the welcome drink and snack (mango!). I did a massage and facial. Therapist was excellent. MY ONLY BIG complaint was that the initial treatment room was over a loud demolition/construction site. So the first part of the treatment was NOT at all relaxing or spa-like. I finally asked to be moved rooms and the staff were great about handling the situation. If you go to this spa- insist on a room in the back away from the street/construction sight - mention this when you making your reservation, when you confirm and once again when you arrive! I will definitely consider Divana for the next trip- but will be sure to remember to make sure that I have a different room."

After we made our decision, they came and asked us which oils we wanted and where we wanted more focus on and where to avoid. Then when our room was ready, they brought us in to change and had us sit down in chairs in the room. In front of us was a bowl of water with flower petals in it. The ladies then came in and put our feet in the bowls and did a slight scrub/massage to them before we climbed into the beds for the massage. And the massage....it was WONDERFUL! The girl noticed how tense I was on my left upper back and she worked hard on it! It felt incredible! My husband very much enjoyed his as well!After the massage, they left the room so we could shower, change, and get ready.

You definitely get way more for you money. My only reservation is that the massage skill of the spa technicians are not spectacular .... probably average. If you want REAL massages (i.e. if you have some real back problems you need fixing) you'll need to go to some other more massage specialized places like Health Land. But for scrubs & wraps & facials Divana is great! They also have a little spa food restaurant attached but I've yet to eat there. And in recent years Divana has opened up 2 other day spa locations around central BKK as well. (See their website)"

From the moment you step inside Infinity Spa, magic happens! Very elegant, modern, spacious but intimate place make you feel comfortable and relaxed. Many small details and meditation music make you feel like you're on another planet. I need to say a BIG thank you to Spa Concierge team- Gigi, Richard and Sunisa for being so professional, approachable and hospitable. They explained to me every detail about their massage's treatments. I choose Relax-atheraphy for 2 hours. The lady who made my day was definitely therapist Kat! She was high professional, discreet, warm and gentle to me. Since I have back pain, she was very careful so I did not feel afraid 'in her hands'. I would highly recommend this place as a one of those places that you want to come back again and again. I am just very sorry I don't have more days in Bangkok to try all treatments they have. It is like a 'private oasis of peace'. This world is very fast, people don't have time to actually live. So, take a moment and spoiled yourself in Infinity Spa! I will repeat it for sure."

Additionally the interior is very stylish and modern, quite difference from other spas where they would have a more traditional Thai interior, this makes Infinity stand out.

We were led upstairs where our feet were washed and then up three flights of stairs to the capsule. The treatment was all elbows and finger tips. At the end of it, I felt like I needed a massage. Not good. Perhaps we should have stuck with the relaxation massage but figured their signature would be good. Very disappointed especially after the trip advisor reviews were so complimentary."

I was looking forward to it all week while I was sweating it out and running my body ragged trying to absorb as much of the city as possible, and it did not disappoint. I booked online, which seems to be a reliable process. I arrived half an hour early but did not have to wait; they immediately served me with a welcome drink and discussed with me which scrub / oils I preferred. I booked a mani/pedi spa which took place simultaneously; about an hour in total. Both ladies were highly professional and I was struck by the cleanliness of everything - the floors, the curtains all the towels and equipment that was used. I nearly fell asleep during the manicure, after which I was served mango sticky rice and tea. I then had the body scrub and massage, which was the best I have ever had. The masseuse, Sara, was highly intuitive and once again everything was clean and professional. I highly recommend the body scrub, particularly if walking in off the hot sticky street, because then after showering you are clean and ready for your massage. I chose the detox (lemongrass) oil and the lovely scent of it really added to the experience. I did my best to stay awake to really get the most out of it, but I did fall asleep at one point - despite the firm pressure I asked for. Sara really eased the tension out of a couple of painful places (who knew the inside of the shin could hurt that much) but what really cinched it for me was when, after mussing up my hair during the head massage, she had been me sit up and combed and braided it for me, which was somehow incredibly touching and made me feel special and cared for, not just as a client receiving a service. Some people I travelled with were surprised to find out how much I spent, as the novelty of an incredibly cheap massage in Thailand was what they were after; however as something I do so rarely I really wanted the best possible experience, and it was still a fraction of the cost the same service would be in Australia. I spent four hours at Infinity Spa and didn't want to leave. If I am ever back in Bangkok I will definitely return. Recommendation: if walking there, bring a fresh change of clothes, as you won't want to put your sweaty things back on after being so clean and having the lovely oil on your skin, which dries cleanly on without having to be removed."

Not leaving you in your own to flick through a book with pictures off the internet but in a book. My Battery in my Phn we dead and they were happy to charge it for me while I went for my treatment .They make their body scrubs in house and have amazing body oils I chose lemongrass and grapefruit.

For an almost 10 hours layover at Bangkok I wanted to treat myself to a spa instead of running around the city and so I researched for one that suits my taste and so I've chosen Infinity Spa. First, I emailed for a few questions and right away I received a response complete with directions from the airport and which train to take. I highly appreciate that as I easily found the spa.When I arrived, I was welcomed by lovely receptionists, very warm and friendly. A few minutes of briefing and getting to know what customers want during the course of the treatment is a great way to start together with a welcome drink. One main reason why I chose Infinity Spa because of its modern tranquil design, if I want to see wood carvings and golden buddhas I'd visit the temple instead. The treatment room is very clean, comfortable, simple yet tastefully designed.The focus is on the treatments they offer and products used. I chose a 90-minute relax-atherapy massage with the detox oil and a green tea body scrub. The therapist, Tanya, is absolutely amazing! As I am very used to massages, I asked for specific pressures on different parts of my body, and she nailed it during the entire 90-minute massage. She is very experienced and well trained and very polite. I enjoyed every minute of my 2 hours treatment at Infinity Spa.After the treatment, I was served with lovely hot tea and local delicacy. The lovely ladies at the reception suggested a very nice Thai restaurant for my dinner and even went out to show me the direction. This place is simply amazing - service, treatment and comfort. Dont look elsewhere, this is the Spa you need to try and I will book my next holiday to Bangkok just so I can get my treatment at Infinity Spa and try the 3 hour package. Big thanks to the team who put this spa together. It was a wonderful experience."

We had issues with our Uber driver finding the location so they not only ensured our appointment was kept, at the conclusion they had a driver waiting for us and personally escorted us to the vehicle. We will be telling everyone how absolutely amazing this business is!"

I was really able to relax, let go all my thoughts and reached the state of nirvana. Once I got home I slept like a baby, what didnt happen for very long time. Last time, I tried the infinity detox package and I loved it as well. I was afraid that I will be bored as it takes 3hours, however I enjoyed it sooo much. The staff is very professional, they even remember my name, I love their oils and small complimentary gestures like mango sticky rice after the massage. Thanks to infinity spa I found the place, where I can find my inner peace again. Keep up good work ka:)"

From the minute we walked in the door we were treated like royalty. My husbands therapist, Lucky, was so strong and my husband enjoyed every minute of his firm massage. My therapist, Thanya, was small but so strong! Both therapists were excellent and I would highly recommend either. The treatments were both luxurious and relaxing and everything you would want and expect from a spa such as this. Absolutely amazing. "

Usually did not comment as the spa experience was not totally enjoyable even visiting the best spas listed in Tripadvisor. This time, the experience at Infinity Spa was amazing and really deserves the good comment.The spa is spotlessly clean, partly due to the white interior decoration. We tried the signature Infinity Aroma massage + body scrub. Just as its description in website, a perfect combination of Thai massage and Aromatherapy. Stronger massage than other spa - strong on your tired body but does not hurt. Don't trust some spa owners that Thai massage is painful. Experienced therapists should feel your body. Your muscles would respond to their actions and the therapists would know the pressure applied is too strong or good for you. The only not so good comment is that the treatment room is small. The body scrub we picked is too fine for men.Truly enjoyable spa experience."

I am a big fan of massage and undoubtedly a frequent traveller to Bangkok because of this. Since I only stayed for 4D3N this time I carefully picked 3 Spa to go with my wife and Infinity was the first one I visited, after surfing into TA website before the trip (as this one was almost on the top of the list with quite reasonable price). My first impression of Infinity Spa was really good - nice, clean and relaxing environment, friendly staffs, warm greetings, caring service......until I get into the major bit of my visit, the massage. I online booked the \"Infinity Thai\" package (2 hours massage plus herbal ball) well in advance and were assigned 2 young therapists, where we totally disappointed about the treatment that we received. The therapists were very inexperienced and frankly speaking totally not up to general standard. They seemed not really know the basic massage techniques. As usual, I was communicated clearly with the receptionist before my treatment that I preferred focus on shoulder and waist and avoid left ankle which I got slightly sprained lately. She also checked the form that I filled out and double confirmed my request verbally. However these requests seemed to be totally ignored afterwards. The therapist has spent quite some time kneading on my back (here and there without any strategy) but not much on my shoulder and waist. Besides she gave pressure to my sore ankle as usual until I told her to stop. When applying herbal ball she seemed not aware she needed to keep on moving without stopping at any particular area of my skin because of the heat. However she missed to do that and I needed to tell her when I felt overheat. Afterwards I also checked with my wife about her treatment and she has similar comments with her therapist.Honestly I have been to many spas in Bangkok and but talking about treatment this was really a bad experience. Luckily I got very good massages on the following days in other spa which doesn't spoil my birthday trip."

Although I was a little late, after I called them they moved the treatment in time, which was not necessary but they did. After talking to the taxi driver he was able to drop me on the spot. And yes I like the multi story spa. Nice details on the building and clever functioning of lot of things. I did the Detoxifying package - 3 hours and all was perfect. They took the time to explain all choices of different products and run true the whole package in detail. Very good therapist and she understood firm-hard massage. All was a nice experience. When in Bangkok I will be back for sure. Can recommend to everybody. Thanks for the birthday cake very attentive. I think this is my first excellent 5 stars on TA!!!"

You are also started with a foot wash and rub before all treatments and given slippers to wear around inside. As we were leaving we had called an Uber to pick us up and Richard the manager quickly rushed over and offered to call the driver as the drivers frequently miss the turn in to the spa.

Modern, simplistic and clean, very easy on the eyes, you can see they have put a lot of time & thought into every little detail..to the furniture,the lighting, to the music. Tip top.My two friends and myself had all chosen the same 60 minute head,neck and back massage and the only issue was...it wasn't long enough! Very relaxing massage, oils were good, not like those synthetic oils you are given where you feel like you need to shower straight away. They use quality products here. We all thought the masseuses knew exactly what they were doing, the 60minutes whizzed by and then at the end, they served us more refreshments...lovely scented hot towels, hot tea, and even mango sticky rice.

The massage was a bit of a let down as I was expecting better as lady in the coffee shop down the road(I love coffee I think it was called) highly recommended it. She usually has 5 hours massage there. I guess for this place to be tops you really need more qualified massuers with good customer service and checking if they need to press harder and try to connect to clients in some way. It felt like the girl that massages lacked a bit of skills in both massage and communication. (not the language she could speak English but you know that buzz feeling just was not there.. Especially paying double or tripple than most of other cheap places around bkk. I was really expecting a ripper massage.So far the best one I had was some place close to mbk I think her name was Ailine. Even though place was a bit dogy and girl asked if I wanted special ( I was not interested) massage was superb. But the experience was still positive overall.

We each had a two hour massage with both aroma and Thai massage elements. Book in advance via email and schedule the day after your flight! The spa always has promotions. Very clean and professional. Stayed at the Peninsula Hotel and it was a 10 minute walk after crossing river via boat. I highly recommend!"

This is more expensive than your average massage in BKK but compared to HK this is not expensive at all. Would recommend checking out their website to see what services they offer and book in advance. Arrived there and was immediately asked about our massage preferences and they tailored the massage to our needs. I chose the relax therapy massage 90 minutes. I did not regret my choice at all, Cherry was absolutely fabulous she was so good that I fell asleep (usually I don't), she was very gentle and I thoroughly enjoyed the massage. Would DEFINITELY recommend this, there was also tea served before and after the spa, after you come out of the spa you will feel very relaxed.

The spa manager benji is super friendly and makes you feel very much at home. One of my friends is allergic to nuts and they promptly went and bought coconut oil so she didn't ,it's out (they use almond oil). It's such great value for money and the spa is spotless, great modern decor with great products (all smell divine!). The staff are so lovely, friendly and professional.

From the minute you walk through the door you forget the hustle bustle of this great city and take some me-time! You are seated and offered a cool drink while reviewing the menu of services with the receptionist. After you make your massage selection, you choose 1 of 4 scented oils that suits your fancy, then you are lead up the steps to the foot washing station, and then further up another flight of stairs to the private massage rooms. You can take a quick shower (right in the massage room) before beginning (highly recommend this), then you lie down for 1-2 hours of bliss. Your masseuse will ask how \"firm\" you want the pressure of her magic hands, and although I don't usually like a FIRM hand, this one was needed for some really tight leg muscles that she managed to release! Everything from the spotlessly clean facilities to the crisp clean linens on the tables, to the bowl of fresh flowers under the massage table which you look into through the donut for your face, to the finishing touch of a sticky rice and mango treat with warm tea is just five star. We visited twice on this trip - the second time as our grand finale massage the last day of our trip, and this first class spa did not disappoint!"

Me & friends really enjoyed this spa & I would recommend it to anyone visiting bangkok. It more luxury than the thousands of massage places u see on every corner of street but very well worth it.

And the staff were professional and nice. It was a real relief from all the spa storefronts you see when walking around and not even that much more expensive.

We booked and extra two friends last minute and infinity Spa were more than accommodating. Our journey to Infinity didn't start so well with two taxis taking us to 2 wrong places. However, we disembarked and tried another taxi who called infinity, infinity explained how to get there and we were at our destination in no time. We had last minute changes to our bookings and infinity changed our treatments on the spot. We were greeted with essential oil test, cold water and towels. The basic pedicure was anything but basic. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It is a step by step process, my advice is to go with it. After the foot soak/wash we were taken up to another level where we settled in for an hour of pampering with free wifi. Afterwards we enjoyed tea, hot towel and mango sticky rice. While this is not the cheapest spa place it far exceeds any service I have experienced in my last 4 visits to Bangkok. You will not find a more clean and ambient space. My friend enjoyed a head, back, shoulder massage by Om and thoroughly enjoyed it. Joy and Sunia had great customer service skills. After our lost taxi ride Joy even went as far as standing on the main road to make sure our taxi and tuk tuk knew where they were going. Now that is service!!! Thank you so much ladies.

Luckily, one of therapist who saw me finding the space and she was very helpful to help me sort this out.I cant remember the name of massage I chose but there were 3 different types combined e.g. Thai + Aromatherapy ending with Herbal Compress. Overall experience is just average. Pedicure menicure service is just OK.

When you enter, you are greeted by extremely friendly staff. The whole place is designed in a very modern and minimalistic way I personally liked a lot. I was told it was created by design students. I booked a 2 hours signature massage, which is basically a blend of Thai and oil massage. First of all the therapist started out kind of soft and I was afraid it would become some kind of wellness massage - which wouldn't have been what I needed as I suffered from extreme muscular tension. But then I told her to go much firmer, which she immediately did. In the end it turned out to be one of the best massages I had during my time in Thailand. Design, service level and massage technique were all fabulous - which is why I would go back anytime."

After massaging, we'd plan to go another place to have dinner but not sure where it is, the reception personnel help us to have a phone call to the restaurant, and lead us outside to show the direction we should ahead, how nice they are. Thanks for those kindly people, we'd really enjoy for the whole treatment."

The furniture and decorations are highlights, in Tiffany blue colour! The infinite aroma package is a must try which is a mix of Thai massage and soft oil massage. You can add scrub as option. The massage oil used is easy to absorb on skin and you will feel the great condition whole day long but not feel oily. I will recommend both the \"relax\" oil and \"energise\" oil, which the aroma is very refreshing. The good thing is this place is easy to make reservation while the quality is as good as the others. Best part is that it is not as crowded and filled up by tourists. Most visitors are Korean and I was told by the staffs, it was because the Korean bloggers highly recommend this place."

I was there recently with a friend and we had the express mani & pedi together with a foot reflexology session. We requested for firm pressure with the foot massage but didn't feel it was firm enough. We made several attempts to inform the therapists to increase the pressure but nothing happened. I had to let it go after a few more futile attempts! When we had our mani & pedi sessions, we noticed the nail clippers, cuticle trimmers and other tools did not come in sterilised bags. Neither were they sprayed with disinfectant before use. I could only assume it was already disinfected prior to our session. Unfortunately, I noticed they used the same set of tools which were unwashed and not properly sterilised nor disinfected on the next customer after me. Same goes for their soaking basins for both hand and foot wash. The used soaking water was just emptied out and wiped down with the same towel that was used to wipe dry my hand or foot previously before it was stored away for its next use. Least to say, I was appalled and unimpressed by this very unhygienic practice! There have been a lot of complaints lately in the media of customers getting fungal infection on their nails from visiting nail salons particularly in Bangkok that do not conform to strict hygiene practices. It would be unfortunate for Infinity Spa to suffer further negative feedback because of an oversight on this."

Although there are many other maybe cheaper massage possibilities around in Bangkok, you should really go to infinity spa!The moment you go in there, you Will suddenly forget the hectic of Bangkok and the other million spa's.Infinity spa is Very professional and the atmosphere is very relaxed and zen. Besides that, i liked the personal approach Very much. They ask (and remember!!) your name and you can always ask for different levels: soft medium or strong.I had the head shoulder Back massage and a foot leg massage which i both really recommend!!"

It was awesome! I had a foot massage, their special Infinity massage (thai massage with aromatic oils), a pedicure and manicure.I had several Thai massages before. This was the best I ever had. Also the Manicure and pedicure are excellent. The service of the staff is great. The spa itselve is very clean, modern designed and with a great relaxing atmosphere. The owner is western and very kind and friendly. There is really nothing negative to say and will definetly come back. Love it."

I had a 2 hour Infinity Aroma massage which is their signature treatment. It was the perfect mix of relaxation and Thai massage. I had just arrived in Bangkok earlier that day after an overnight flight so this was the perfect jet lag fix. The massage room itself had a dedicated bathroom area and was very quiet. The whole spa was spotless and inviting. I loved the hidden foot baths in the floor. Five star spa with an excellent focus on service. I got stuck in traffic trying to get to my appointment and my taxi driver dropped us a little down the road so I had some trouble finding it and I know now not trust the locals for directions! I emailed the Spa to say I was lost/running late and they called me on my mobile and guided me to the right street and even came out to find me. Benji was an incredible host and so helpful with tips and advice about Bangkok even getting his local staff to teach us how to say thank you and hello. The tea at the end was delicious too. I'm sad I ran out of time to get another massage but thank you so much! I'll be back in October!"

Was looking for more of a spa type of experience after 2 weeks of inexpensive, traditional thai massages, and saw that Infinity Spa was highly rated and within 10-15 min from my hotel. We were close to partaking at the Elemis Spa at our hotel (st.regis), but found it difficult to pay the high prices after being in Thailand for so long.Infinity is the perfect in-between of high-end luxury spa and the lower priced spas (good ones) that area all over the place in every major thai city. I had the 120 min infinity aroma treatment with the lemongrass & pink grapefruit oil and my wife had a 60min luxury mani and 60 min luxury pedi (at the same time). The massage was the first massage I've had in thailand that didn't poke, prod and bent me around too much, but also massaged my sore muscles (probably from too many massages?) and was extremely relaxing. The hot thai compress at the end was a great finish to the treatment. My wife said her treatment was also great, with up to 3 people treating her at some moments (someone took a picture of her as she seemed like a \"VIP\")!The service is also great, with the owner and people up front being super friendly and attentive. We were starving before our treatment and they recommended a solid Turkish place next door and told us to take our time and pushed back our treatment!I HIGHLY recommend dropping in if you're in Bangkok and need a nice, RELAXING massage, as this was the best of the 7 massages I've had in the past 11 days!"

However, what sets Infinity Spa apart from the others is the immaculate service and quality of treatments from the moment you enter until the moment you leave. The owner Benji greeted me by name as I had made a reservation. That is certainly how all staff at Infinity Spa go above and beyond what is expected to impress and welcome their guests. Benji proceeded to explain the treatments and recommend what I should indulge in based on my needs and the amount of time I had as I had dinner plans and needed to be back in my hotel by a set time. Benji offered me a glass of water with naturally flavoured ingredients to refresh me and proceeded to identify the types of treatment best suits me. I definitely wanted to have a massage, a facial as well as a manicure and a pedicure. I bought the signature massage called \"the Infinity Aroma\", a rejuvenating, moisture based facial called the \"Revive Hydra\" and had an express manicure and pedicure as I was in a hurry. The therapists were warm, friendly, polited, professional and highly trained. The treatments were just sublime and having travelled extensively around the world and in the Asian region, I have experienced many types of spas but nothing comes close to Infinity Spa. This is one place you want to go to complete any trip to Bangkok"

From Google map, it was within walking distance from my hotel in Silom. Well, it would have been had I not gotten lost, gravely misled by the reliable GPS app in my phone which never failed me in other countries. Perhaps the GPS for Bangkok wasn't quite updated because it kept leading me towards a wrong direction. I had to reschedule my appointment several times because I kept missing the time due to being lost. The person I spoke with over the phone, Benji, was kind, very patient and empathised with my situation in being lost. There was no point in me getting a cab because it was really within walking distance, just that I kept turning into the wrong lane.By the time I finally found it, Benji was outside the spa looking out for me. My goodness, now that's what I call excellent customer service! His patience and continued guidance with directions made me persevered because had I been speaking with someone whose English wasn't so fluent, I would have abandoned the plan.Turns out Benji is the owner of the spa and the map was indeed faulty because his spa was newly opened and he had been trying to get the relevant authorities to update the map location correctly. So my advice is, get a cab unless you're very familiar with the address.Not only was the service top notch, I was welcomed with a nice cold towel and refreshing drink to cool down after having walked miles for hours.I was introduced to my masseur and then taken up to my massage suite after a brief feet wash. Being a regular spa goer, I must say that my expectations are high but the entire experience surpassed my expectations. Not just the service, the interior, layout and the hygiene, but also the quality of the massage technique and products used. I will definitely visit again every time I visit Bangkok!"

Beautiful decoration, spotlessly clean, ultra polite and discreet staff.After arriving you are seated and given a refreshing towel, delicious tea and are shown what treatments are available. You choose the treatment and you are given a choice of three homemade oils, relax, calm or refreshing.Once you have chosen your treatment and oil you are taken up to the massage suite, which includes a lovely shower and toilet for your personal use. The masseur is introduced to you and the type of massage is discussed and she enquires whether you have any injuries etc. This the start of 90 minutes of pure relaxation, just wonderful. Throughout the massage the masseur checks if everything is ok. She also checks whether you would like the massage to be stronger or softer. The lighting, temperature, music and atmosphere inside the massage suite is wonderful, so perfect. Once the massage is finished you are escorted downstairs and given a special tea to finish off a fantastic experience.I strongly recommend everyone, whether you are young or old to visit Infinity, you will not be disappointed. One of the best recommendations any business can get is that you will return. I WILL definitely return to experience different treatments and to relax and recharge my mind and body.I wish Benji and all his team the best of luck and thank you for an unforgettable experience. "

The staff are incredibly kind and well trained and the design is an unique, refreshing change from the typical Thai spa. Highly recommended"

We've been in the Far East (Bangkok, Myanmar, Laos) for 10 weeks now and had many, many massages but this was the best by far! A little more expensive than others in the area but well worth every baht! It's very clean and comfortable, the staff are very professional and the attention to detail is amazing. I couldn't recommend it more highly!"

From the moment we arrived to the time we left was a truly wonderful experience. We were warmly welcomed by Benji and as soon as the doors closed behind us we left the hustle and bustle behind and stepped into beautiful tranquility. We chose the 90 minute foot reflexology treatment, which was incredible. The therapists were attentive to our needs and very skilled, the chairs we lounged on very comfortable, the atmosphere calm and quite. I loved the attention to detail that Infinity offers, which makes you the client feel that much more cared for. It's the small things that count and it is clear to see that the owner has put a lot of thought and heart into this place. It is beautiful, immaculate and offers excellence at a very affordable price.Thank you Benji and team"

The towels that were used were cold and I prefer warmer towels to rinse off the products. Much time was spent washing off various face products. I also did not like the feel of the seaweed mask since gauze is placed on top of the face first and then hardens which I found unpleasant. Given that the price is the same as in Toronto I expected more."

Luckily I saw the sign on the sidewalk directing us to Infinity. I appreciated the modern branding and resonated with the environment right away. Benji came out and introduced himself, then proceeded to explain the treatments and prices. As another reviewer said, we ended up feeling like long lost friends. The massage was wonderful and my pedicure still looks good after two weeks on tour. We felt like VIPs from the start to finish, and the quality if service and products is very high. Why go elsewhere? The interior is white, turquoise, and very modern. You know it is clean because the white floors and walls are shiny and without blemish. So refreshing and tranquil. Be aware there are stairs to the treatment rooms."

I'm lucky enough i've been to Bangkok many times, and have had the privilege of having spa treatments in salons and hotels around the world. I'm only saying this because I want to highlight how good my experience was at Infinity. I took a chance by trying this new spa, as i stay in the area often and have always had a good experience on my regular spa, but a small sign intrigued me. From the moment I walked in i felt like i was in a boutique hotel spa, and was worried i was about to pay hotel prices! Not so, the prices were comparable to other spas in the are which are older and tired looking now i've been to Infinity. The service (as common in Bangkok) is impeccable and english is not a problem which really helps especially as I had a broken toe and my therapist Tarn didn't dare go near it for me :). the place is so clean, the decor is modern but not cold or stark and still has an asian feel, it's nice to have that lovely tiffany blue which is surprisingly relaxing. I would suggest taking a shower either before or after as it's lovely and luxurious. The massage itself, was great, no need to ask for more or less pressure, and felt professional from the start, i have to admit i nodded off a couple of times it was so relaxing, The facial (Detox) was different to what I've had before and lovely also with the added 30min massage focused on limbs which was excellent after the initial massage as they were loose so it was an extra benefit. I saw a 'crew' special I asked about it and it's for air crew so if you are, then you will get a discount there! Also unlike ALL the spa's in asia, the therapist offers after treatment amenities, says thank you and leaves, not waiting around for a tip, I asked and there are dedicated envelopes with their names on for this which was something i had never encountered! All in all, it's worth either the trip down to silom for a visit or worth a change from the usual if you are often in the area, just try and I can promise you won't go anywhere else! Thanks Infinity"

The reception area is very pleasing for the eye, and as the rest of the building you can smell a nice fragrance in the air. Stepping into the reception area already made us come to peace. The receptionist was very helpful in our choice of package. She rec recommended us packages that suited our needs and was very professional about it, it was obvious that our well been was more important and that she did not try to push the most expensive package. The massage was wonderful and really made us feel much better."

She still needed to measure the pressure points with her fingers.I didn't think it was a bad massage though... Until I went back to my hotel and discovered red bumps all over my shoulder, neck and back. I has a severe allergic reaction from the cream/ massage oil.

The spa looks nice and clean, not too much decoration. Minimalistic while maintaining faithful to ancient Thai design. Clever way of decoration. The massage was very good,before the massage the therapist asked us if there were particular areas where we were in pain or wanted some extra attention given to it. Shows she was really wanted us to be relaxed and enjoy it to the fullest."

Amazing treatments, warm welcoming staff, lovely therapists and a nice clean spa. The only downfall was the temperature of the treatment room during the first two hours of our four hour package it was so cold from the air con to a point we did not enjoy the body scrub or foot treatment due to being freezing the actual treatment carried out was excellent however we understood the hot weather conditions outside does not make the therapists job easy. We asked them to turn the air con down during the second two hours meaning we both felt way more relaxed the herbal compress massage was absolutely amazing both myself and my friend fell asleep. The two therapists were very friendly however did talk to each other from time to time during our treatment in Thai which was slightly off putting, therapists should not speak to each other during a treatment . We were offered tea on arrival, snacks and tea during our treatment and tea after our treatments. Lovely touch, Would definitely recommend to friends and family great value for money and lovely staff / treatments."

We felt welcomed and they were ready for us. I had the one hour thai yoga massage and one hour herbal ball massage. My husband had the one hour aromatherpy and foot massage. My husband was having knee issues and his masseuse was very knowledgable and did an excellent job. I did a little research on thai yoga massage and was quite excited to try this new experience. I have been practicing yoga for 10 years and i am quite flexible and strong. However, i was disappointed, it was just a regular massage with me lying down, using mostly her forearm and pinpoint technique. The herbal ball massage, i didn't care for either. It was a heated herbs wrapped in a ball and she just moved it on your body. Perhaps, that is what this massage calls for, but it did nothing for me. So at the end this was a mixed experience. As for pricing, we thought the pricing was extremely low when we made our reservation prior to our trip, upon arrival, there's so many many massage places even cheaper. Although, i don't think the ambience was as zen and peaceful. At the end, when it was time to pay, there was another woman there. She was not friendly at all and just asked for payment, which was 200 baht above the price quoted. No big deal, we tipped the ladies and left. I can't help but feel I was cheated out of the opportunity to a thai yoga experience."

It's a awful, sinking feeling when after much anticipation and not long in to the massage you realize this is not good! Hot stone massage- terrible! Swedish - she had no idea! and to massage against venous flow - really bad! Foot massage - pathetic.Sorry I didn't get the name of my girl."

We got some ice water upon arrival and picked our massage oils. We had taken the luxury package with the four hands massage. We started off with the foot massage, which was great. The body scrub was a little uncomfortable as it was cold and wet on the bed, and the bathroom was so small only 1 person could take a bath at one time so someone else had to wait, all crusty with bits of scrub and freezing. However after that, we got a quick break with hot tea and some delicious biscuits, which was a nice touch. The Thai hot compress was just so-so. The four hands massage is a bit of a hit or miss, depending on your masseuse. I didn't enjoy mine as they weren't in sync, speed wise or pressure wise, but my friend enjoyed hers tremendously. Overall was a relaxing experience and pretty good value for money - just wish my massage had been better!"

A great escape from chaotic Bangkok. I booked my service thru their website. The service was prompt and very good. Staffs were friendly. I chose elite package which I highly recommended for 90 minute massage including body scrub and swedish deep tissue massage. The masseuse know what she is doing. She gave me the best massage of my life. I tried several places but nowhere like this place. Highly recommended this place if you are visiting bangkok."

This place was recommended to me by a friend because of their foot massages, so I gave it a try.I was able to put in a reservation through their Facebook page the day of which was really slick, and the place was relatively easy to find and only 15min walk from my hotel! I noticed on their facebook page that package 3 was the most requested, so I went for that one. It was 2 hours and 45 minutes, which was a nice amount of time.They do take credit cards for all massages over 500 baht, mine was a visa. Overall, the message was really good, the masseuse asked me about the pain and everything, and it really seemed like she cared about doing a good job. If I had to be picky, I would say her time management was a bit off, as she seemed to take longer on one part, then seemed to rush through the end. But the overall effect was still wonderful.Facilities-wise, the place is very nice and tranquil. Probably not as polished around the edges as the hotel spa, but much nicer than many of the houses I lived in during college, and it didn't bother me at all."

The website state it closes at 930 but they state on their door that the last appointment is at 9pm. The provide lockers to keep your valuables while u donyour massage. We did aromatherapy massage for 90min (B900). They had 5 choices of oil to pick from: lavender, mint, lemongrass, relaxing and energising. I tried the relaxing one which smelt like lavender and lemongrass mixed. Before the massage started we were asked to take a shower first. The treatment room was very simple: 2 hard mattresses on the floor. Rather than having the face donut, there was a pillow and towel to prop up your face and chest to let you breathe. The masseuse were good and professional, the strokes were on the hard side, similar to Thai massage but less of the cracking and body twisting. I think you can also shower after the massage but we were asked to shower when we get back to our hotel as it was late already. Overall still a very good experience and I will visit again in future."

I got the traditional thai massage (without knowing what it was) and the guy who worked on me was incredibly professional while twisting my muscles into shapes I didn't know they could go into! I would certainly recommend people getting a Thai Massage if they haven't before as it really does loosen up the muscles and joints and doesn't leave you feeling sore or lethargic.Great experience all around!"

We did not get to wash our feet before massage. Poor treatment for staff when management did not care about hygene standards. Imagine if u are the staff massaging some smelly feets. We did another massage at Diora which was around the same price but the quality of service was so much better. The staff was wearing mask. Shower, drinks and dessert were complementary.

I was looking for a real professional place, not some seedy tourist trap, so previous TripAdvisor reviews proved extremely helpful, as always. I also was very nervous, as this was the first time I got any kind of massage.So first of all, this place is a little hard to find, it is in an alley off the main street. Look for the bigger Naj (restaurant) sign on the corner, on the opposite side of the street from the BNH hospital; the green Ruen-Nuad sign is below it.You walk into a little waiting area, with a receptionist's desk right in front of you. They have a menu of services; I was going to ask for a 1-hour massage, but the receptionist convinced me to go for at least an hour and a half - very good advice! I wish I had gone for even 2 hours! (The time goes by very quickly.) She also asked whether I wanted a male or female masseuse; I didn't really care, so I just said I wanted someone good. After less than a couple of minutes' wait in the waiting room to the left of the reception, a young man summoned me to go to the treatment area to the right of the reception. He showed me to a small room with a mattress, gave me a robe to change into, and left me for a minute to change. (The room has a roll-up bamboo curtain instead of a door (or indeed the fourth wall) for privacy.) He also showed me the bathroom, which I recommend using before the session, because part of the massage includes abdomen pressure which could be uncomfortable if full. He came back a couple of minutes later, and told me to lay face up on the mattress. He started by wiping my feet with a wet and then a dry towel, and proceeded with the massage, which went all the way from my toes to the top of my head. Then he had me turn over onto my stomach, and repeated massaging the whole body from the other side. It was an amazing experience. He used his hands, elbows and even knees to get at knots and stress points I did not even know I had! His manner was exceedingly calm and polite, and he worked very hard. All the while, soft music was playing in the background. Altogether, I was very relaxed even though initially I was nervous about the whole experience.As other reviewers noted, this is not the place for candles and decorations and scents etc.; they focus on massage, and they do it very very well. It is impossible to describe in words how rejuvenated I felt in every part of my body. I wanted to go back the very next day, and probably every day thereafter, but unfortunately my schedule did not allow it. For everyone who is trepidatious about getting a massage, if it's professional massage that you want, this is the right place. The price, for a 1.5-hour session, was 500 baht - an excellent value!"

Perfect for me a guy that was a runner/ jogger most of his life and did she loosen my foot up; thanks You need to look down the alley across from the hospital and restaurant with same name looks out of business.If I had more days I would go back for full Thai massage.

Having looked on Trip Advisor, Ruen-Nuad was close to where we were staying and priced reasonably so we decided it was worth a try. I called in the morning and obtained an appointment for a 2 hour massage priced at 350 tbh per hour, total 1400 for both of us. It isn't a luxury spa resort but it is simple, pleasant and calming. We were greeted with a smile and given sandals to wear and shown a locker to put our belongings. We were taken upstairs where our feet were washed and dried by 2 smiling Thai ladies, both very professional but with limited English. Then we were shown to a large room with divided partitions for individual treatments and were given rooms adjacent. There was a mattress on the floor and a blind was pulled down for privacy and we were given large cotton pyjamas to wear. My partner's lady had a good sense of humour and told him to lie down, then covered him with a blanket and said, \"Goodnight!\" The Thai massage was very thorough, no muscle was left unturned! It was painful in parts initially, but when the areas were revisited it felt deeply satisfying. It was 'good' pain! The Thai ladies were strong and powerful, manipulating, pulling, pushing with every part of their bodies and understood every muscle. They also included head & deep shoulder massage at the end and stretched us out. It was an excellent experience and I can highly recommend it. This is authentic Thai massage, not aromatherapy gentle massage! If you want to benefit from this type of firm massage you won't be disappointed! Many thanks from a happy pain-free couple!"

There it is hard to get a real traditional thai massage, cause the young ladies do not have long experience, the right technique and also not the strength in theire fingers.so i searched the internet and found recommendations for the ruen-nuad massage studio. i found it without problems in the convent road at the opposite ot the hospital.i had to pay upfront 500 baht for 90 minutes of traditional thai massage. a usual price for a good massage. the lady was indeed older and definitly a pro. she found the spots where i had muscle ache from exercising and worked on it really deep and hard. of course this is no fondeling around and also not only close to the edge of pain. it is sometimes painful and it has to be when you have muscle aches. she did the whole body (without touching my dick) and also kept an eye on me lying comfortable on the massage bed so i can relax good. i would say this is definitly on the top-three list of all the massages that i had if not the best. it was strong but very good. so if you are staying at silom and don't need happy ending but a real massage this is the place to go. i definitly will go there again."

They have only two massage chairs which are fairly small compared to other places in Bangkok. So the seating itself wasn't very comfortable to start with. They also had a portable AC/fan which didn't provide enough cooling. The massage itself was more painful than relaxing. The masseuse didn't speak very good English but even with my sign language and face expression of pain - the message didn't get through.

And never forget to make a reservation before you come, since its business is booming. The free wifi connection there is poor. Just forget about ur cell phone, and enjoy a good relax. Never do massage when you are full, rather do it starve. BTW, there are a lot of good resranrants nearby, such as Banana Leafs, Bua\u2026you can have a good bite after a good massage.

We were the first customers at10am. Staff who saw us did not bother to smile at us. when one of the managers attended to us, her service is more profound and friendly than the lady we met the previous two days. i also requested a masseuse with strong hands but was utterly disappointed. i had a lady assigned to me while a male masseuse for my partner. the male masseuse is well built but according to my partner, the masseuse strength was that of a young kid even though partner requested stronger rubs. i was not impressed with my masseuse either. i guess in thailand, they are recognized for their thai massage and not foot, so let's just choose what they are good in. one very common behavior of all masseuse is that they will wait for you to finish collecting your stuff from the locker and as they ushered you out of the door, they were hoping to receive a tip from you. Would i return? perhaps and it would be a gamble of luck to be assigned a good masseuse. and this time, i would ask for her name. alternatively, there is always a Healthland to rely on."

However I had few tight spots in my shoulder and neck, so I was really looking forward to have it taken cared, so uncomfortably went ahead. My wife got a masseuse for her oil massage.

I had no idea he took 90 minutes as I did not keep track of time, but realized it when he only spend 10 minutes on my shoulders and told me the times up. What a disappointment, I went back to my hotel and got another 1-hour head and shoulder massage. On the other hand my wife said it was one of the best massages she got in her life. She was extremely satisfied with her masseuse and still talks about it. You take your own risk and go there, because it's a hit or miss. I sensed a bit of arrogance at the front desk, may be it is because now that they have been featured on CNN Travel ect. Also there were lot of return customers, may be they just give special treatment for those, and give us, the new customers, second class treatment. I don't know, whatever it is, I would not go back there, instead stay in the hotel and go back to the masseuse at my hotel, which is convenient and delivers what they advertise for my money."

I have had both a foot massage and a traditional thai massage, and would recommend either. The thai massage is in a small room with a mattress on the floor and the foot massage is in a shared room with multiple chairs, so it definitely is no frills, but the therapists are great. As mentioned in other reviews, not all of them speak English, but I have not had a problem communicating my preferred strength of massage. I will definitely return on my next trip to Bangkok.It can be a bit hard to find. it is located back from the street across from the BNH hospital."

No fancy stuff here, but the real deal at very good rates. We normally opt for the traditional Thai massage or the foot massage. As most of the therapists are not very fluent in English, it is best to explain your preferences (soft, medium or hard pressure, focus on back or shoulders, no twisting etc...) to the staff at the reception."

Around 800 baht for 60 minutes, which I found to be one of the least expensive places. Although I have had only a few massages in my life, I believe it to be of high quality.

This is not the place to go if you are after a pampering massage with great smelling oil and the soft sound of music or water. But if you are looking for a solid fuss-free traditional massage, then this is most definitely the place to go. The masseurs have great hands, and they have an uncanny way to know where are your sore muscles even without you having to tell them. I have sensitive calfs, and in the past have experienced cramps in the hands of many less experienced masseurs. At Ruen-Naud, the masseurs held my calfs firm and proceeded with firm strong strokes at my calfs ..... no cramps, and my calfs felt so relaxed thereafter. We have a heavenly 1.5 hrs oil massage.Most definitely will visit again in my next Bangkok trip, this time for 2 hours :)"

The masseur are very skillfull and knows how to work the arms and hands in the right pressure to our muscles. We tried for the 1 hour Thai Massage for 350 B and regret why we did not taking the 1.5 hour or the Spa package instead. The place was very basic, as in wooden floor and matress lying on the floor, but the sheet was clean and tidy. No specific aromatherapy, music and ambience for relaxation as you would expect in high rated spa, but the simplicity just catched my attention. The bathroom is clean and again very basic. We were given a clothes in humongous size during the massage. After the massage we were given a special herb but unfortunately below our standards (as we come from the country of very strong and delicious herbal drinks- Java). The receptionist were very straightforward in making us select the package without having to explain each packet. Probably language barrier."

The lady who massaged me used adequate strength, and avoid the crackling on my back.3 of us felt so relaxed after the 1.5 hours session. We went on the day after, and had other therapists working on us. I told the lady in simple english, about the fall i had on my back. She then used Tiger Balm to massage on me.

You pay first and then choose the oil you want; there was Energising, Lavender, Mint, Relaxing but we went for Lemongrass. You lock your belongings away and then are shown to your room which is clean and basic. A mattress on the floor, basic bathroom attached with a shower and toilet + shampoo and body wash. Shower first, the 1.5 hours of deep tissue body massage. Brilliant. Then they get you a cup of herbal tea and start the head massage and final back massage for the remaining 30 mins. After a full 2 hour massage you can shower again (I quite liked the lemongrass oil on me for a bit longer) then it is all over. I tipped around 15-20% as I was that pleased. TIP: you will be pretty much naked for this massage save a few towels placed over you. If you are uncomfortable at all, you should request a male or female masseur as you see fit. I wouldn't recommend keeping any underwear on though as they pull, stretch and knead the full length of your back to your buttocks. Also be sure to request a couples room if you want it done with a partner as they won't book this as standard. Afterwards you will feel relaxed and we were tender but still wanted to have one 48 hour later before we left. Great."

I booked over the phone for 2-hrs of Thai Massage after checking the review on the TA because my usual massage place, Health Land is fully booked for the whole day. I noticed some of the negative review but think it was worth a try and expecting not much can go wrong for a simple Thai massage.I booked for 5pm appointment and notified them that I would be coming late and re-booked for 515pm instead. All went well, and I arrived at 515 pm. It was 3 guests in front of me and I must wait, around 10 mins, not a big deal. As it was very hot outside and after a long walk, I decied to take shower first, They informed that Thai Massage not include shower and it will be 20 baht extra. I didn't mind to pay and took 10 mins of shower. So basically the massage was started at 535 pm.The session itself wasn't so bad, but around 7 pm, the masseuse was keep looking at the small clock and looks confused. She informed me that my massage should already finish by 635pm!! I was so suprise as I booked for 2-hrs massage. I explained to her but she didn't speak english well so she showed me the small note/receipt from the reception showing that I started at 1635 (435pm) and should finish at 1835 (635pm) !!!I asked her to check with the reception again and advising her that i came at 515pm and the actual time should be 535 pm instead of 435 pm. So she went to see the reception and been advised that the person already change shift and gone home. But it seems she has everything settled and start massage again. Around 715pm, she stopped the massage and said already finish. Now I was becoming really upset and again explaining to her that I started at 535 pm , so I should be entitled for at least another 20 mins, not including the amount she must left me to check with the reception.She seemed didn't understand what I was saying so I was asking the manager came to see me. She left me in the room for around 5 mins. Honestly I didn't feel a mood for a relaxing massage anymore, Everything just left me in a very bad mood and experience. So I changed my cloth and ready to went out. I went down to the reception/cashier and found 2 new ladies attending the desk. They were saying that my reservation was for 515 pm and that was why the massage stop at 715 pm. I explained to her again that it was a mistake and the actual massage was started at 535 pm and the time on the small note was supposed to be 1735 instead of 1635.I asked for my 1 hour of money back so they returned me 100 baht. (2 hrs session cost 600 baht and 1.5 hrs cost 500 baht).I left the facility upset and not refreshed! This place is definitely not worth any single penny. Health Land is much much better and even cheaper than this.Please save your money and do find some better option in Bangkok. There are so many much more over there."

I was about 45 mins into a 90 min massage when the woman from the front desk/reception burst into my private room telling my masseur he had a booking and dragged him away (note that they take the fee upfront so I agree, he had a booking, ME!!) There was no communication with me. She'd brought a replacement masseur who looked a bit confused and dumbfounded. I tried to give it a go for 10 mins but the whole relaxing vibe had been destroyed by the intrusion, the style was different, he didn't know what had been done or not done etc so I excused myself and left. I've never had such an unprofessional experience at a spa in my travels. If the small, friendly local place is no longer small and friendly then you might as well go to a Healthland or similar - larger, but more professional than that. If you expect your private room to be private and your massage to be uninterrupted give some other place a go."

There were no pillow cases on the pillows (i needed to ask for 2 towels to cover - the 1st one being dirty) and the beds did not seem very clean either. I found it very hard to relax due to it feeling dirty. The massage man i had was good but seemed to be in a bad mood and it was all over within 45 min or so (i had requested a 1 hour massage). The other issue i had was there was some construction noise next door which didn't assist in relaxing.

The woman at the front desk was friendly and helpful. I chose the 1 1/2 hour traditional Thai massage instead of the two-hour because I wasn't sure how much I would like it. My therapist, Pom, was amazing. She told me she had 24 years of experience and it was one of the best massages I've ever had. Her English was basic but we were able to communicate well; she was very sensitive to my needs and checked frequently to make sure everything was OK. She really worked out the knots in my body, which sometimes hurt, but I like a really strong, intense massage.I booked with Pom again a second time for two hours a couple of days later. This was at 10am on a Monday and I was the only client there for most of that time, so if you want a very quiet, peaceful experience, first thing in the morning on a weekday would be a good time to come. I was still a bit sore from the previous massage two days before and she added Tiger Balm and oil to the massage and backed off the intensity a bit on the sore spots to make me more comfortable.Pom told me she does not recommend the one-hour traditional Thai massage since it is too rushed, so if you are starting out, you could try the 1 1/2 hour massage to see if you like it. If you know you don't like an intense massage, the oil massage may be a better way to go."

I always ask for a 'great' masseur and till now, haven't been disppointed (I've been there about a dozen times). This time in particular, I went with a lingering pain in my left arm and neck. It'd been bothering me for about two weeks and I was pretty eager to sort it out. I booked in for 2 hours and got ready for some heavy duty massaging. LIttle did I know the masseuse would start off gently then start to press on parts of my shoulder, back, neck and leg that became painful. She explained that they were all related and that she'd have to slowly work it all out. Slowly but surely, after some pretty accurate acupressuring (if that's a word), I emerged feeling lighter and taller than when I went in. I was told that my arm was just a small portion of the tense muscle that resulted from months, maybe years of poor computer-front posture. Ruen Nuad will be a quarterly outing even though I live in another country. I recommend everyone do at least 90 minutes because 60 minuters don't let you get into the crook of the problem and you have to wrap up. Also ask for a rolled up towel under your ankles when you're facing down otherwise your legs get a bit painful after a while. Drink the tea at the end - it's good and good for you."

It was 500 bhat, that's about $17 USD!!!How can you beat that??They start with a Footwash and then they have you get dressed in some scrub type clothing. They take you to private curtained off areas with nice music playing and a fan going to keep you nice and cool. Halfway through they bring you a cup of tea which was very good And start on your back. I also work on your scalp and face.I like the fact that it was very peaceful and masseuse did not talk a lot,in less it was see if everything was okay.I highly recommend this place it is awesome for the price, even if it costed more.It's very easy to get to on the skytrain and MRT. Sala Daemg stop not Silom.We use the trip adviser app to help locate it using GPS it took us to a place about a block before the massage studio. But close enough enjoy!"

You think Bangkok and massage and all sorts of things come to mind ....they here is Ruen Nuadon Convent Road easily accessible from Silom Road close to Sathorn. Every taxi motor cycle tuk tuk guy knows Convent Rd. Equally easy walk from Silom Station at BTS about 3 minutes.This place is fabulous ... Not overly obvious by the curt mannerisms of the women at the front door who you pay first. Whatever you want they do well, and I have been here probably 20 times including today and of all the places in this city this is my fave for massage or body scrubs etc.Not cheap but heck we are talking joke money ...2 hr Thai massage for $20. Sure u can fund for less but the masseuses here whether male or female really know their stuff. I walked in today sore and tired and left feeling great. The masseuses really try to make sure that they work out what ails and I am yet to have anything but the best of experiences. And I sometimes want to hate it after the brusque manners at entrance but within minutes all is forgiven. I only have one remaining comment .... TIP WELL. Wages suck in BKK and the tips are what makes the difference as otherwise it all goes to management. Next door is Sense of Nails and whatever I said about Ruen Nuad applies equally to Sense of Nails."

Do you want to avoid a glitzy setting, inflated prices, or a potential happy-ending solicitation? This is the spot.It's on Convent Road, which is easy to get to, a 7 minute walk from Sala Daeng BTS station. The setting is a pleasant Asian building with communal spaces for massage (mattresses separated by drapes) as well as private rooms.Definitely opt for a 45 minute body scrub (600 Baht, $20 US), followed by a 2 hour Thai massage (600 Baht, $20 US). This three hour, $40 experience will leave your skin silky smooth and your muscles fully well stretched. All you stress will float away. Come in the late afternoon so as to escape the summer downpours. When you leave, you will be feeling amazing, your body will be limber and your will taste even more delicious than it normally would.Most of the massage therapists here are top notch, but not all. Make sure you tell the front desk ladies that you are in need of a quality therapist! My favorite is Ken. If you do not like the massage style or intensity, be sure to speak up. I have gotten a dozen massages here, and only one was less than fully satisfying.Skip the foot massage option, it's not as good as Chinese foot massage. The Thai massage and body scrubs are amazing. The chrysanthemum tea post massage is heavenly. Booking ahead is recommended but when I don't, I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes."

If there were \"Good\" between \"Very Good\" and \"Adverage\", I would choose Good instead, but anyway, this is my review:I went there twice the first 2 days of my holiday in Bangkok. Totally based on the reviews on guide books and some photos. We were glad to see the house after a little walk from the BTS station (not too far though). As you know it's a wooden house, nothing spectacular nor tacky. As for the massage, I had oil massage twice, the first time was by a younger masseur who was ok, not bad, but it was more like he did his job and back to the staff room relaxing. The 2nd time was done by another guy, he did a better job, he seemed to be more experienced and paid more attention.By the way, there's a juice bar at the stuido, can have a little smoothie or tea, but the smoothies are totally limited of what they have in the freezer, don't rely on the menu. Oh, and the mid-age lady (with mid length straight hair) who made the drinks for us (wonder if she was one of the owners), she wasn't friendly at all, seemed a bit up-tight. I had to constantly smile at her to finally get a smile back. The thing I like about Ruen-Nuad is that they're more laid back and causal, but then if you're looking for posh and perfect looking places, it shouldn't be your choice. In terms of the quality of the massage, I guess it could be varied, so, better remember the name of the goods ones!"

I thought I did enough research before deciding to head to Ruen Nuad for a massage, reading as many reviews and \"best massage in bangkok\" recommendations as I could. As a guy who enjoys legit massages (not that there's anything wrong with those who enjoy happy endings), I was a bit weary of the vibe I got from the countless massage studios you pass on the streets of Bangkok, and it seemed that 80%+ of the massage places also offer \"additional services\". I ended up choosing Ruen Nuad because it was conveniently located near my hotel (Le Meridien on Surawong).I did NOT enjoy the experience. Upon entering, I was met with by two Thai women at a reception desk. I did not have a reservation, and they immediately said it was not a problem. They quickly summoned a masseuse from behind a curtain, and I signed up to do a 2hr oil massage. She escorted me upstairs to a room and asked if I needed to shower. Sure, a quick rinse to clean the Bangkok sweat off would be a good idea, I thought. It literally look me 2min to rinse but the girl was nowhere to be found for another 10min.Once we got started, I was immediately disappointed that I didn't request a man. In the US, I tend to ask for male masseuses because they were stronger, though I've had a handful of excellent female masseuses as well. I could barely feel her working on my back, despite making two requests for her to use more strength. We had some small talk over the course of the massage, which I could done without. At one point I asked her how long she had to train before becoming a masseuse, and she replied \"2wks for the oil massage, and maybe 3-4wks for the Thai massage.\" This confirmed that I was literally in the hands of an expert!While the massage itself was lackluster, I've always considered a bad massage better than no massage, so I decided against saying anything further. There could be worse things than having someone rub oil on you for two hours. But towards the end of the massage, what really annoyed me was the fact that we ended about 15min early. It seemed that the massage time started as soon as I was escorted and asked if I needed to shower, including the time she was MIA for 10min!! While I still didn't say anything (why bother, if I'm not going back again), I decided against tipping her and smiled politely as I left, thanking her for her service. Originally, I was planning to go back the next day for a Thai massage, but instead decided to head to another place called Thann Sanctuary. (Considerably higher priced, but worth the cost and I didn't get cheated there.)"

Not entirely visible from the street. There's no prominent sign to indicate the entrance of the studio. I went with my gut and walked straight towards the old-looking house at the end of the lane. The lady at the desk was busy talking on the phone. She wasn't exactly rude but she's not very friendly either. Tersely, she asked if I want male or female and pointed me towards an area with lockers saying, \"You can put your things in the locker if you want.\". All these happened without her moving from her comfortable seat.I was led up by my therapist who spoke monosyllables sparingly. I figured that I needed to disrobe and shower. The room was spacious (it's a massage room for couples) and no hangers or hooks in sight to hang my clothes. The massage itself was kinda mixed. Sometimes, it felt good. At other times, it felt painful and uncomfortable. Most of the time, I didn't felt relaxed at all. It was quite a relief for me when the massage ended. The only positive thing that I can remember from this experience was the sound of falling water (it was raining). After the massage, I collected my belongings and have a look around the spa. Apparently, they sell some aromatherapy oils but the bottles looked dusty and sad. The lady I met earlier was replaced by another lady who doesn't looked very friendly. She made no move to ask about my massage or enquire if I wish to purchase the oils. In the end, I left the house and finally heard the lady speak, \"Thank you for coming.\". Would I return for more? Most probably not. I know of one or two massage places that offer a better holistic experience. Frankly, I was disappointed especially after hearing so much good things about Ruen Nuad from my friends through word of mouth."

The building is nice and more traditional which is why I chose it. So many of the spa's in town look very sterile- this is not one of them. The rest of my family were downstairs. I told the receptionist to have the masseuses go easy on my 3 teens ( I have had several real thai massages, which sometimes is not for the faint of heart). They all 3 complained (and still do to this day...) that they were barely touched during their massage after my request. My husband had a shared room with my daughter. Her stories about his massage are pretty funny... (he had a traditional thai massage) which according to her involved lots of grunting/contortion on his part). He liked his massage, but will be visiting the upstairs rooms next time. Next time we are there with the family, I will recommend the full treatment and let them fend for themselves. :)"

He wore heavy rings and a watch during the massage, didn't seem to be a real massage therapist or else was a complete newbie, and crossed the line more than a couple of times.

I came back from BKK last Sunday.tried several places & must say Ruen Nuad was a mindblowing experience.Both hubby and I were fantasizing over how we can be at RN in our sleep-no joke!it was that gd.We went on a rainy day,walking in from Saladaeng BTS to 42 convent Rd. we walked like what seemed forever and thought\"Did we walk in the right direction\" but bingo..we saw the beautiful Henri Matisse lime green logo and knew we were there.Ruen Nuad was tucked behind a rather posh restaurant.it had a rather charming entrance that's at once unpretentious and inviting.The owner we met was part of a female duo who is at once no nonsense yet warm and systematic on her approach.we were immediately put at ease when we felt her profound knowledge of massage.we had opted for the 850 baht in house specialty oil massage. We were given a choice of oils to choose(i chose energizing,my hubby relaxing- both of which had subtle notes of aromatherapy infused) i loved the oils-They smell and feel just right when glided on. Not rancid and with enough of an aromatherapy punch.(I digress:at Healthland wattana branch,I couldn't even choose my oils even when it's stated I can choose from lavender,ylang ylang and an anti cellulite bkend as stated from the brochure. They replied curtly\"we already choose lavender for you\" - wow so much for democracy*and service*- mayb I went at 10.30 and there were closing at 12 but still?! Then don't print that in the brochure if you dont intend to let your customers make choices.Digression aside, Ruen Nuad's masseurs really hit the right spots literally.They pummel,knead and coax ur achy muscles into sheer submission. at the risk of sounding overly sensual, we have never felt a massage so sublime. From the oils to the therapists' dextrous handwork-the unyielding muscles finally succumb to the slow and steady crescendo that the therapists orchestrate. We were heady from such pleasant detoxification yet thoroughly relaxed,falling into a deep slumber,only to be awoken gently when the massage was over. The therapist didn't just mindlessly probe and press. They effortlessly located the right achy spots,never once pressing on bones, releasing only achy areas that were built up with lactic acid.never has been a massage so spot on- we were amazed and awed beyond words.One thing though: since we turned up w/o bookings,the room upstairs was probably occupied and so we had the older room downstairs-We could hear the creaky wooden floors when people walked upstairs. So for those not attuned to said rustic quirks, book in advance for the room upstairs.We wished we could hv remembered our therapists' names.We already plan to head back to Ruen Nuad next year and encounter sheer bliss again."

This establishment has several positive reviews,Tripadviser,Nancy Chandler maps etc;and it was on the strength of these that I decided to go there even though it involved a 40 minute trek across town.I went there on 3rd April in the evening to suss it out,and booked for the following morning at 11.15.While there I asked to see the facilities as I wanted some privacy and not the All-in-a row type place which can exist.They reluctantly let me go upstairs and I crept about so as not to disturb anyone having viewed what appeared to be small cell-like room with curtains at the entrance.The place is an old Thai house and this I feel is half of its initial attraction.The next day I paid for a one hour Thai massage at 350TB(an oil massge is 700TB),altho the Reception tried to persuade me to have a 2 hour one(dread the thought!!)and was shown upstairs where my feet were washed and I was shown into a bare cubicle that had a thin mat on the floor,a wooden box(to put your handbag on??) and a hook on the wall to hang your clothes.There was also the usual cotton top and pants to change into.The lady that did the massage had no idea and in my opinion no formal training in Thai massage.She squeezed and pushed parts of me in no particular order and one side of the body being treated differently from the rest.She also jabbed her elbow into the base of my spine which was painful(I had already told the Receptionist I had a lower back problem)After we were half way through and when I realised it was not going to improve I asked her to stop.While getting dressed I saw that there had been another staff member sitting crossed legged on the floor outside the cubicle as if she was monitoring the session.I went down stairs and complained to the Receptionist and she spoke to the masseuse.I don't know what was said,but they refunded the fee in full.I have had Thai massages before,have also trained in Nuad Bo-rarn Thai massge myself,and am a complementary practioner,so I do know when a treatment is correctly(and safely) administered.Was I unlucky,definitely!But staff have to be trained and monitored and you can't let loose inexperienced staff treat paying customers as guinea pigs.Having an interesting(but basic) premises is just not enough.The massages I have had at Wat po were fine.Also the ones in \"Massage in Garden\" Rumbutri Street in the Banglampoo area of Bangkok.This year the oil massage was only 280TB,the tables are raised and have face holes,there are towelling robes,shower facilities and the massage takes place in opaque \"tents\" situted in a green garden.Very good value and I had a girl who did a good but gentle massage."

If you're walking from Silom you'll pass a hospital on the left hand side - the Ruen Nuad is on the right and tucked back off the road behind what looked like a pretty classy restaurant.Prices were really reasonable and the studio was clean.

The prices aren't dirt cheap but they are very reasonable for the services provided (traditional Thai massage is 350 baht for an hour). Each massage room is separated by a bamboo curtain and the massage therapists are professional - you don't need to worry about getting a surprise ending (you never know in this city). After your massage, you can enjoy a fresh fruit drink at the juice bar. The whole experience is wonderful."

During the float , I can totally relax my muscle, doing medication. I don't have any problem floating just my belly felt a bit cold. After the float ,I feel my aching neck pain was better and the fingers didn't wrinkle after 45 min soaking in water. It was relaxing and great experience, it costs 1950B per session.

I had a warm welcome throughout the entire experience, I was offered delicious hot teas and crumptious snack (I now regret buying a bag!!).

Last week I went to Theta State Float Center which is near the Rama IV end of Sukhumvit Soi 24 in the same building as Carl's Jr. The staff was very nice, explained everything and then got me right into a room (the pods were booked). After a quick shower I climbed into the warm water and turned off the light. I never did fully fall asleep but did enjoy the relaxing hour in complete darkness, complete silence (aside from the tinnitus ringing in my ears) and the 'weightlessness' of floating in the salty water. After about twenty minutes I made use of the neck pillow so my big head would be a bit more inline with the rest of my body. You pretty much float in the middle of the tank and just relax. It's not as easy to relax as you think. I was sitting there thinking,\"Man! Am I always this tensed up?\" I've gotta say, it was such an unusual sensation having no other sensations that I don't think I got the full benefit of it and will be going back again soon. From what I've heard and read after some sessions you can get into the tank and get right into the relaxation mode. We'll see how the next visit goes. If you've never done it, I'd recommend trying it at least once, if only to say that you've done it. You don't need to bring anything, just show up and float au natural."

Although I had read about floating and get good idea before I go , but experiencing it in real is different. Their staff is very nice and friendly, the place decorations and lightening give you relaxing feeling even before floating. After taking shower you get in the floating tank and adjust yourself laying on the water surface, after few minutes you will be in another world. It is something like meditation , you feel as if you are laying on the air, very relaxed, your mind is clear, don't want this state of relaxation to end. My only mistake is that I booked for one hour floating but I think it should be at least 90 minutes. For sure i'll be back to the center more than once when I visit Bangkok again."

Getting out you feel so relaxed and clear headed.The float center is a good 15 minute walk from the Phrong Phong station.

Theta State Float Center offered a very professional, yet relaxed and nonchalant experience of floating. They provide everything you need to feel at home and everything is really clean and smells good. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the owners are usually around and more than willing to chat about your experience or just about life in general. They are also very flexible and offer a wide range of different packages, which bring the cost of floating down significantly if you would like to be a member and go more regularly, which I highly recommend to take full advantage of all the health benefits. Overall, I have gone 4 times and plan to get a monthly membership soon. The facilities, the staff, the price and the over all experience were all excellent in my opinion."

As the top 2 spas are floating centers and my husband doesn't like traditional massage, I decided to give it a try.The location is not so convenient as we took BTS and we needed to walk for 15 mins. As BTS is nothing cheap anyway, I would suggest to take cab instead. The receptionist explained to us clearly what to expect so we were quite at ease. We did have a bit worry that we might have claustrophobia of being \"trapped\" in the tank, but since we were the one to decide whether or not to close the tank, we were totally fine. I never expected myself could really relax while floating on water, but surprisingly I fell asleep!! By the time I woke up the waking music was already on (don't know for how long) so I had to rush to have shower and dry hair. As I have long hair, I didn't know how much time I have to dry hair so it gave me some stress. :p will be great if they could inform me how my much time I have to finish off. In sum, it was an interesting and fantastic experience as we had never tried floating before. In terms of pricing, you just can't compare it with other normal body massages; after all they are totally different. I've seen other travellers commenting on how relaxing their bodies are after floating, but honestly I didn't really feel much. :) maybe I was not so tired to start with"

            "review": "Waste of money, unless you believe in the science of floating. This floating center's target group are tourists who are looking for new experiences (my impression). I was one of those tourists. The website is exceptionally well made and I was immediately convinced that this is something I have to try out (have never been floating before). I had really high expectations which were unfortunately not met. Before you go there ask yourself if you really want to spend so much money for an experience which is not much different or more relaxing than lying on your bed.Unless you are a spiritual person you most likely will find the experience of floating rather boring. I was lying there and was bored to death. Unless you sleep in there (cheaper to sleep on your 5 star hotel bed) time will pass super slow. A lot of people actually write that they sleep in there and felt super refreshed afterwards. Well that's the consequence of sleeping, but not necessarily of floating. The staff is all really friendly and cool. No complaints here. Everything very clean and organized. You can tell that it's run by western managers/owners with very good business sense. Kudos to you! This experience left unfortunately quite a bad after taste for me. I cannot stop thinking that I got tricked by a very good business concept focusing on making money. If you believe in floating please go ahead and book with Theta. They will not disappoint you. However if you just look for new things to do in Bangkok then I can promise you that you might have much more fun and relaxing time spending this huge some of money (for Thailand standard) on countless other possible amusements in Bangkok."

The experience is extremely relaxing and is a little different every time. When I go into it worn-out or sleep deprived, I'll fall into super relaxing sleep in the room and emerge totally refreshed. Other times I find my mind free to wander: I've been able to revisit memories in stunning detail, or visualize plans and ideas with incredible clarity. Sometimes the experience is dreamlike and transcendent. It's beautiful every time and has becoming an important element of my weekly routine -- a fantastic wind-down after a long day, but also a great way to unlock creativity before sitting down to a session of writing or other work. A lot of my best ideas hit me during floats; it's even better than the shower! I really can't recommend it enough. Go into it with an open mind and no expectations. Try a little meditation in there. It's an experience like no other. And the staff are super sweet and helpful, and full of useful tips and tweaks: use the neck pillow or don't, play relaxing music at the beginning or don't, etc. They made my first time an easy and natural experience, and since have been present and perceptive, ready to chat if I want to process thoughts from the float, or to leave me to chill out by myself if I just want to sit and think over a cup of tea afterwards. It's a mellow, welcoming, delightful place. Definitely worth a try if you've never floated!"

Got to Avenue Mall, and Theta State Float Center is really nice! They take the time to explain the process, provide you tea, shows you around the floating room etc.The floating room has the dressing and shower room all for yourself. The place was sooo clean!! Since it was my first time- I really had to learn to quiet my mind :) the relaxing music during the beggining and ending in the float pod was so relaxing but after the music I felt it's too quiet. The team explained it's normal when new with the floating experience. I felt very relax after and all that salt really gave me a wonderful good night sleep.I can't wait to continue floating pods back in california. I'm so glad I had my first experience in Thetat State it was a cool, relaxing visit! :)"

Once I started floating in the warm, buoyant water it took my mind some time to adjust, but it was extremely comfortable and the hour went by very quickly.

I just finished my first float and I don't often think to write reviews right away, but this one certainly warranted it.From years of playing competitive sports and mountain biking, I've developed the \"back of a 70-year-old\" (I'm 30 now). I found this out after an MRI from my doctor, not just me saying so. I had a really tough workout yesterday and could feel the painful spasms in my back flaring up all morning. The usual Thai massage does nothing for my back and on occasion makes it worse. Luckily, someone recommended this to me so I thought I'd give it a shot.Within ten minutes of floating, I could feel my spine relaxing and I suddenly heard and felt an audible pop (more like a thud) in my back. Almost like a chiropractic adjustment lol. Within another 20 minutes, my back had completely relaxed. I'm sitting here writing this now and I can't get over how loose my back feels. it's incredible. Before the float just bending down to tie my shoes was difficult now it feels great.The entire experience was really great. Annile the owner, was super nice to talk to and the entire place has a great vibe.With this, you certainly get out what you put in. It was a super weird sensation just floating with no light, no sound, and only your thoughts. But it's like you can finally stop being distracted and put some real thought into what you need to think about. At times I would completely zone out and meditate then other times I would be thinking incredibly hard about random things.After it was said and done it was like I needed a minute to gather my thoughts and shift back into reality.I highly recommended it. Go in with an open mind and just shut the world off for an hour. And if you have back pain... even better!"

My girlfriend and I visited Theta state for our first float and could not be happier with the experience. When you first step through the door, you'll meet Matt a super warm guy from Thailand who gives you blue tea and talks to you about the experience. Everything is well explained and very easy. The session is completely private so theres a couple of things you have to have to remember as you won't be disturbed once your session starts (unless you call for assistance).1. Start with a Quick 5 min shower 2. Dry your face3. Cover up any cuts with vaseline (provided). The high salt content can sting if you have any cuts or if the water gets in your eyes. For this reason it's recommended that you don't shave for at least a few hours beforehand.4. Put ear plugs in (optional)5. Turn off the room lights6. Get into the pod and close it.7. When the float starts music will play for 5 mins to help you get accustomed to the setting.8. Once you feel comfortable turn off the light in the pod9. Enjoy the wonders of sensory deprivation and being off the grid10. Once the float session is about to conclude the music will play again for 5 mins11. Once the music stops carefully step out of the pod and take a shower. Be careful to get your bearings when you step because the salt will make your whole body pretty slippery.The whole session including tea was about 1 hour and 45 mins. The staff are extremely helpful and Matt does a great job at guiding you through the process if you've never floated before. All the staff are also avid floaters themselves. We also had the chance to meet the owner Annile who started the center. Annile has a great passion and enthusiasm for floating and you can tell a lot of thought has gone into creating a \"set and setting\" that is just right. The center has a very warm friendly feel with a chilled out vibe thats perfect for floating. The facilities are modern and well placed making getting in and out of the pod, showering and drying yourself off easy and comfortable.All in all a very nicely put together float spot and experience with great people behind the business. highly recommend!"

After, what I imagine was, 15 or so minutes figuring out how to float comfortably I felt completely relaxed, almost weightless, and got into a euphoric trance, completely focused on my breathing and the weightless feeling of my body, until the end of the session. I can only hope to one day be able to achieve this same level of meditative focus during my sessions at home.The facilities are very modern and comfortable, and the staff were very kind and welcoming. I felt like they really wanted me to have a good experience.I went with my friend, an experienced floater, and my girlfriend, another first timer like myself. She fell asleep almost instantly (lol, but pretty standard for her) but also spoke positively about the experience.The best part though was the feeling of stepping back outside into the sun after the float, feeling completely relaxed, happy, and energized. It is kind of hard to describe... it felt like my mind was more open to everything around me and I could appreciate everyday things that otherwise wouldn't have entered my thought process."

Me and my girl friends wanted to try something different but still relaxing and pampering so we chose Theta State Float Center for a first float experience after reading the reviews here. The staff were welcoming and knowledgeable in preparing us for the float. The environment was relaxing and the actual float takes a bit of getting used to at first but it's really a great way to really switch off from the world. Skin and hair feels great after the float too! A real plus was that they have 2 floatrooms and 2 float pods so that up to 4 people can book their float at the same time."

For the first timers out there, just go for it, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

I floated for the first time in a float room today and loved it, the extra space was really nice. The centre is lovely an clean and everything you could need for a perfect float is provided there for you. Would definitely float here again!"

The layout of the reception is incredibly welcoming, this of course includes the decor, the delicious tea, the soothing music and no less the extremely friendly and knowledgable recpetionist - who was able to explain with ease and professionalism the floating experience.The floating itself was surreal and surpassed any of my pre-determined expectations. It is difficult to explain the floating experience, other than to say that it was like pressing pause on life, alebit for one hour. You could feel yourself unwinding from the daily stresses that exist both in the body and the mind. I often draw comparsions between similair things when I go to a new restaurant or maybe read a new book for example, however there is no other experience that I have had that I can compare to this one. The only word that I can think of, with the help of an online dictionary, to describe the floating is phantasmagorical.The only downside is that I have to go to Bangkok to be able to float again."

Not sure if that's what's supposed to happen but I liked it. Fingers crossed floating pods will make their way to Yangon shortly.Ps. I'd also recommend purchasing a bottle of Siam Botanical body rub. It's provided in the changing room, so it's possible to try before you buy."

We went to Theta State Float Center for our very first floating experience, and did not regret trying it.We received plenty of information by email right after confirming our booking already, including some videos that showed what the experience would be like. I'm a bit of an over-planner so this was great for me, knowing what to expect.The team was very friendly as we got there and took plenty of time to explain to us how everything worked and making sure we were comfortable. The floating experience itself was great! We chose the pods as we felt that was the more \"authentic\" floating experience. I generally have a hard time relaxing and shutting of my mind but felt that floating on water actually helped. I enjoyed feeling the warm water around me and even moving around a bit from one side to the other in slow motion - it felt like floating in space.Afterwards, we sat in the lounge on one of their sofas and had some tea and a complimentary energy snack, which was a great way to settle back into the real world after our hour of floating.I highly recommend this place, especially if you've never tried floating before. They really do provide everything you need (loved their shampoo!) and make sure you're comfortable and enjoying your time there. It was a great introduction to floating and next time we're in Bangkok, I'd like to go again!"

And I didn't regret, it was truly a great experience. For me as a high energy person it was a great way to slow down and relax. The session was going for on hour and after 15 minutes of me thinking that I was relaxed I felt that my body started to melt and deeply surrendering into relaxation. I was in the state between being awake and asleep. The non gravity effect of high salt content in the water made me feel if I'm floating in space.After session I was so relaxed that had to take a nap in the middle of the day even though it's not my regular thing, and that night I also went to bed early. I felt fresh and new next day, well rested and energized:)Definitely recommend to everyone to at list try it , and if you feel excessive stress in your body several sessions will make a huge difference in your well being.The centre itself is already a beautiful experience, friendly and caring staff is adorable. They will take a great care of you and make you feel safe and comfortable."

As this is my first time I chose the room as the space is a bit larger when you float. Soft music was played for the first 15 minutes of the float to help you relax. After that, for me my mind just start drifting. It was amazing how the whole one hour went by, I were in a stage between fully asleep and consciousness. I felt so peaceful after the float and I felt like I have almost drifted to the edge of the universe, lol. I chose the 60 mins package, should had opted for the 90 mins instead.

I loved my first session so much (it was such a brilliant & romantic gift - thanks to my inspired husband!) we went ahead and booked another 4 sessions on the spot. Theta State is so chilled, it has two waiting areas, there is a fab exchange between folk as you are getting ready, and each room is totally private, soundproofed, well kitted out, everything you need. Just bring yourself! And get ready to unwind! Since my first experience here, I've been sharing with friends and family, and highly recommend to everyone wanting to enhance creativity, decrease stress, and curious to see just how far the body can learn to relax. Spread the word! Those in the know...float!Jessica Pelham"

I so appreciated the warmth I recieved upon arrival and the time that Annile and staff took to throughly explain things to me. Thank you guys! The float itself was highly rejuvenating and afterwards I felt calm and content. This is an experience that is hard to put into words, but one that I feel all must try. The experience of feeling fully boyant floating in the water was simply blissful. Please give it a try for yourself and you'll see what I mean. I went for 60 minutes, but next time I will certainly go for 90 minutes so that I can fully absorb the benefits of being in the \"theta-state\" of mind. Thanks again, A+ experience!"

Having said that, I must say I really enjoyed the experience from the very first visit. Shutting down your senses for an hour lets you enter a very deep relaxed state that is very hard to achieve in your normal environment. For me, getting into this state got easier the more I practiced.If you're into meditation, this kind of setting lets you get into a deep meditative state very easily, much faster than you can do in your normal environment. Even if you're not into meditation, you'll certainly feel it's benefits. You leave the pod/room perfectly relaxed, like you've just had a great massage. Careful, you may have a hard time falling asleep after!The equipment is top-notch, making it probably some of the best-value floats out there. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable, making sure you're fully prepared for your float. You'll be served tea and a small granola snack, which is absolutely delicious.If you live in Bangkok, make floating your habit with some of their packages to get an ever better deal than the standard price (as cheap as $35 per float). If you're just visiting Bangkok while traveling, do yourself a favor, skip the shopping malls and tourist traps, and treat yourself to an experience you won't forget."

There is a reasonable chance that i have floated more hours over the past 15 years than everyone else who's left a review so far put together, and after a number of visits here, I can say that Theta State hits the important notes right. Their tanks are high-quality, clean and well-maintained, and all the facilities - from the two lounges (pre-float and post-float), to the private rooms with closet, mirrored dressing area and shower, to the silicone christmas tree earplugs, inside-tank towel and neck pillow (for those who haven't learnt to relax into the sometimes-uncomfortable tension-releases yet) - demonstrate a level of attention to detail that can make all the difference in such a minimal environment. This is a great place for new and experienced floaters alike, and its central location makes it an easy visit for travellers who want to take a short skytrain trip to get off the beaten path.Some points worth pointing out:- If you have a bit of extra time to spare before your float, use it to acquaint yourself with the books and artwork on display in the lounges, as they are there for a reason.- The tank temperatures are adjustable to one decimal place ('C), and if you know your individual preference and tell the staff in advance, they can pre-set it for you. Otherwise, just stick with the default temp.- Use the earplugs not just to keep the salt out of your ears but to block out outside noise and tune in to your body's natural sounds and tones, so that they synchronise with your bodily vibrations, which may also start getting louder as everything else fades away. If the internal sounds and the sensations synch up before you tune out completely, you can start going out-of-body or into wake-induced lucid dreams, which may or may not be what you're looking for.- Go in with more curiosity than expectation, or at least as much."

The name of the staff who attended to us in emails & in person when we visited was Joy. Friendly & professional. Cosy environment. The procedures & rules stated in the website are all fully applicable. Before the floatation therapy, we had to bathe. I was so impressed by the rich lavender smell of the shower gel & shampoo that I bought them after the session. Its stated in the website on discounts for first-timers like us, and we requested for it when it was initially not offered to us.A crux was as such I was uncomfortable lying on my back in the salt water for a long period & realised it's important to have some special form of support for my strained neck. The cushion provided didn't really work. More importantly, I was unable to relax in complete darkness due to a creepy psychological feeling. I started to panic when the salt water got into my eye, which irritated my eye, and I couldn't locate the switch or towel! I almost slipped due to the wet floor & this was when I was still desperately trying to locate the switch. Managed to find it eventually & decided to end the session early. My friend found the session okay though so I guess it doesn't work for everyone. Its another good learning experience about myself."

Into the first 20 minutes, my thoughts went randomly on mundane issues until the music stopped, I then went into the dreamlike state. I found many \"ah-hah\" moments about myself, about my health, about happiest moments of my life - moments I had forgotten, kept locked away, that even my RAM was unable to find until this reflective hour. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants their subconscious raised to awareness. I emerged an hour later a happier soul - now what could be better than that?

            "review": "\"Incredible Meditation\". They say the quickest way to change your behaviour is to change your surroundings, and if you have EVER wanted to try any form of meditation... well, this damn thing is going to force you to meditate, whether you like it or not. But this is more than just meditation. This is akin to an out-of-body experience, if your mind is open and you've had some practice calming yourself through traditional forms of meditation.First things first - Mat (?) at the front desk was extremely helpful. He gave me a 20% discount because the music didn't work (I know, I thought he was crazy too, but I wasn't going to argue). He calmly explained the music signals when the meditation is about to begin, and when it's about to end, but my meditation would start and stop with a sound of a pump. He explained everything in thorough detail - the science, the way the meditation calms your brain and brings feelings of happiness, the way the salt makes you float - everything I had read beforehand was repeated as per verbatim. It was comforting to know I was in the hands of someone who cared about the experience.One thing to note: I was prepared for this float. I listened to podcasts on people floating and I do meditation on a regular basis, so I have some idea on how to calm my mind through breathing exercises.When Mat brought me into the capsule room, he told me the normal brouhaha (take a shower, don't put your face in the capsule water or the salt will irritate your eyes like hell, there's fresh water to wipe your face in case this happens). He left me alone, I stripped naked, showered, put in some earplugs and commenced the float.The beginning of the float was bizarre, to say the least. My mind was simply deprived of every sense except for the feeling of the water against my skin. It didn't really know what to do. After about 10 minutes, I noticed pain in various parts of my body, and most noticeably around my neck area. It was quite intense, but not in an unendurable way. More like a - \"hey this part of your body needs to heal, and we're going to do this now\" kind of way. Throughout this part, I simply did my breathing exercises.About halfway through, something started happening in my field of vision. Green and white misty swirls started to cloud my vision. It was strange, the best way I can describe it is that it looked very much like music visualization software you would get from itunes of windows media player. The minute I tried to focus on it, the swirls went away. I started focusing on my breathing again, and the colours came back. It was incredible, and I truly forgot everything at this moment. I was just... in the moment.When the float was over. I stood up and at this point salt water entered my eyes. How did it feel? Think of a squirrel clawing his way into your eyes, thinking your pupils were chestnuts. I ran to the shower and rinsed off. I spoke to the owner's girlfriend, who was very kind and said that my float is a rare one - where the experience is more than just simple meditation. An experience like my own tends to happen after 2 or 3 floats for most people. Mat confirmed this as well. They took a photo of me (with my permission) and gave me some amazing blue tea. I wish I stayed in BKK longer to experience theta float again. They have an increasingly popular service, but more importantly, they care about their clients and truly value float meditation as something that can enrich your life.And that neck pain? Yeah that went away."

The water is full of Epsom salts so you float without touching the bottom even though the water is only about 10 - 12 inches deep. There is soft music playing, it only plays for the first few minutes or so. You can keep the lights on if you want; it's all totally up to your own comfort level. When you are alone with no intruding stimuli, you will start to have thoughts that might surprise you. I ended up thinking of a book I'd like to write. It was a little bizarre.

We got there 30 minutes early and were allowed to sit down and use the wifi, which was very nice of them. When our time came about, everything was kindly explained and the service was nice, which makes me feel bad about the two stars.When the experience began, we were in seperate rooms and had to take off all of our clothes and put them in a closet. No lock of any kind. I trusted the staff and didn't say anything, but it did make me a bit nervous and, since I was there to relax, it wasn't a good start. They should give you a key to the closet and somewhere to hang it in the room, just to help put your mind at ease. Anyways, I sucked up my apprehension, took a shower and got into my salt bath room. I followed all the directions and lay down and tried to relax. The thing is, I'm a very light sleeper and noises distract me. They advertised the room as sound proof, but it wasn't. I kept hearing a faint thumping, like that of someone opening and shutting a door or pipes making noises in the wall. It bugged me so much that I actually sat up and opened the door to my room to check if anyone was looking through my stuff in the outer room. No one was, but the noises persisted. After opening the door, I ended up getting salt water in my eyes, not too enjoyable. I followed their directions and sprayed the fresh water and used the clean towel. When I hung it back up, it must have hung into the salt water, for when I used it again it didn't help much. Still determined to try and enjoy my experience, I blocked out the slight pain left in my eyes from the salt water and lay back down. I kept the door to the small room closed, for the staff had said it might get cold if I opened it. I soon found that the air was very dry and that it was a bit hard to breath because of this. When i cracked the door, it felt better, but I shut it because the staff recommneded against it. My wife kept hers open and enjoyed the fresher air. I wish I had done the same.Overall, I found floating on salt water to be interesting, but didn't enjoy my experience. When I told the staff about the noise, she defended the place saying it was in an old building and that when they built the place the ceiling between the first and second floor wasn't so good. I have no idea if others have mentioned similar things, but it seemed like at least one other had. The rooms shouldn't be advertised as sound proof. Maybe the pods are."

For those who do not know what to expect, 60mins may feel like forever in a confined space.

I've been interesting in floating (sensory deprivation) for a few years but I never got around to trying it until a recent trip to Bangkok. A friend I have that lives in Bangkok referred me to Theta State Float Centre. The staff was friendly and knowledgable and prepared me how to optimize the experience. The centre was clean, well kept, and had a welcoming vibe. I recommend the float room as its more spacious than the pod. The float starts with some relaxing music as you adjust to the feeling and then its complete silence. The are no distractions from your senses so you can completely disconnect from whatever stresses you have. I walked out with that feeling when you trying something really interesting for the first time and very relaxed. I was told the second float is even better and I will be back to float again before I leave Bangkok!"

They also take a Polaroid (if you allow them to) to add to their wall! Also a nice touch! We floated in two of the rooms, but next time I'll try the pods. They also had everything you need to leave straight from there to see the sites! (Hairdryer, gel, brushes, even contact solution). I could not recommend this place more!

Tea is served before and after the float, and there's a living room to sit back and relax for as long as you want. Inside the room you will find everything that you need, including new earplugs, clean towels, vaseline to cover cuts from the salt water, the dressing table. The float itself was very relaxing, as I drifted into sleep and woke up refreshed from the noises of the world. Needless to say, I slept peacefully during those nights that I floated. I am a regular now; I float regularly at this center. Highly recommended!!"

Even if it doesn't end up being your \"thing\" I believe everyone should try it at least once. My friend and I were 30 minutes late for our appointment even though we left plenty of time (Bangkok taxis / out of town visitors not a good mix for directions) The people at the Float Center were so accommodating. I was afraid we were going to miss our appointment but they made us feel relaxed and welcome regardless of our tardiness.Floating was a great way to decompress mentally and physically. The benefits of the epsom salt on your body are endless. I stay pretty physically active with yoga and other cross training methods and the salt baths are great for your recovery. The husband and wife owners are clearly passionate and well-versed in all of these benefits and are very excited to share their knowledge. It's so refreshing to see this passion in business owners. The experience and the customer service are what sold me on stopping in here again the next time I'm in Bangkok.The owner couple even chatted me up about my next stop in Chiang Mai and places I should go off the beaten path.

The overall reviews here speaks for itself (of course minus the once in a blue moon demanding and unreasonable customer as expected). Neil, Joy, and the team have really done a fantastic job to create a great floating experience from start to finish. They actually care about your experience, and it's all in the details. Each and every tank here is kept in immaculate clean condition, the rooms are well prepped, and the customer experience is top notch from start to finish. I love floating here so much that it is my favorite gift to purchase for visiting friends from out of town! If you've never floated before or even if you've some experience, I highly recommend Theta State to everyone!"

For the first time visitor, you might feel a little strange, don't know what to do. Here's a little tip, do not forget to wear the ear plug, it can help you to reach the calmness easily, no water will tickle your ears. The first fifteen minutes without your mobile might be a torture time, but believe me, you'll be ok without it for an hour. Just relax and let yourself float freely. Close your eyes and either meditate or you can just take a nap. There will be music playing 5 mins when the session starts and again before the session ends. So don't worry, you'll be waking up freshly in time. I had experienced a lighter body after a session of floating, the tired muscle got an hour break and it felt relax after the float.For those who are afraid of the narrow space, i would recommend the room type, high ceiling will make u feel more relax. For those who are afraid of the dark, you can keep the dim light on and you'll be just fine.Overall experience is great, facilities is well located, nice and friendly staffs. Love it here!!!"

The staff explained to us in very detail what to expect and how to enjoy.We had to shower before step in the pod, once I stepped in and whole body lied flat, immediately floated up , followed music to relax and enjoy the unique feeling. For the first 5 mins my shoulder a bit tense but after for awhile , all the feeling , stress and even time all gone . I just could feel I surrounded by warm water in all dark environment ( you can turn light on or off) , totally isolated to the world outside which is very different with any other spa , it really help your mind relax. Unlike normal spa, there's no people to massage you, you don't feel anything of your muscles but just relax . It's pretty similar with sleep on a water bed, just you can't sleep side way and feel absolutely isolated. My husband shared his experience with me which is very different. He first 10 mins kept bouncing two sides as he is big, once he made any movement in water then the current pushed him to other side, took him some time to use to but soon could enjoy. After 1 hour section, I actually felt not long enough as you easily lost time track inside, I felt my whole body pretty light. I usually experience my muscle pain after over pressure during massage but not this time. It's a easy and special way to let whole body muscle relax and rest for 1 hour. I will do it again next time ."

So off I went reading about it and found out the many apparent benefits it gives to the mind, body and probably spiritually too. And I finally had the chance to experience it on my most recent trip to Bangkok. The centre is located a 10-min walk from Phrom Phong BTS station in Sukhumvit area. On arrival, I was greeted by the staff and had to fill up a questionnaire. Mac explained briefly about floating, in a calm and patient manner. I also had the chance to talk to the owner, Annile Alexander, who shared his own experience in floating. He put me at ease with his sharings. I was glad to know that I'll be floating in clean water at the very least. Oh, and the place was clean, calming and tranquil. The pre-float experience was definitely good. Mac ushered me to my room and after explaining the dos and don'ts I was left to do what I came for. I am somewhat aquaphobic and initially I struggled to relax and just float. I also made sure I could easily push open the door to the chamber, locate the water spray and small towel just in case I really needed them. So after testing that everything was working fine I finally shut the door and floated. I probably didn't get the \"meditational\" benefits but my stiff shoulders and knee aches were gone, enabling me to enjoy in good spirit, the rest of my one-week learning journey in Bangkok. I definitely recommend everyone to try this at least once. I am already planning my next float, and I want the \"Pod\" the next round. Thank you."

Due to my fear of claustrophobia, I chose to go into the floating room, as opposed to to the floating capsule. I was impressed by the fact that the water is recycled three times between patrons and sanitized by ultra violet light -- a very clean environment! All floaters are expected to shower and shampoo their hair before they enter the water. A neck pillow was available for those who require extra neck support and a yummy healthy treat was served, along with a cup of hot tea at the end of the session. I loved the opportunity of being able to get away from it all and caught myself drifting off into a deep sleep several times! The session began with new age music and ended with more of the same. I felt totally relaxed and ready to face the outside world once the session had come to an end...just wish it could have gone on for longer!A clean private room was provided, equipped with a vanity, blow dryer, ear plugs, towel, natural shampoo, conditioner, liquid soap and body lotion.

Only when I really just let go of my fears and my expectations and was able to get to a peaceful (dare I say blissful) state of just being cool with what is. Through this is a gateway to creating connection to whatever imagery/vision has relevance for the individual floater. At least that was my experience. For anyone interested in meditation made simple, try floating. Also the experience lasts far beyond the tank, you carry this relaxed attitude out of the pod with you and the streets of Bangkok seem a little less crazy than before, energy and spirits are lifted high, even work is a pleasure. Yes. Really! Oh and I love the little granola balls and blue (lilac) tea they give you its a lovely little bonus treat at the end."

The owners and the staff are incredibly warm and accommodating and the center itself is very quiet and peaceful.After floating for one hour, I felt surprisingly refreshed and rebalanced. I think beyond just the meditative effects, which are great for restoring your mental energy, the benefit of floating is in the water, which is loaded with minerals and set at a temperature in tune with your body's homeostasis. Much like the Dead Sea, floating can actually promote your skin's natural water balance and replenish your body's energy cycle, so not only is it relaxing but also rejuvenating. My first visit was so amazing that it convinced me to start floating as part of a healthy routine for my mind and my body. Now I recommend this place to all of my friends and even bought my boyfriend a package for a birthday present!"

At the very least, you're going to get an hour or so of respite from the grinding human condition by suspending your body and ridding yourself of the torment of gravity - that, alone, is worth it. But, if you give yourself a couple floats (or, maybe you're lucky and it happens during the first one), you'll start to reap the innumerable benefits to your mental health as you drift into a transcendental state where your body fades away and your stream of consciousness flows into the nether. Oh, and the staff? Top-notch hospitality and very, very well-informed. Like that big shoe company says: Just do it."

I was looking into Sensory Deprivation before Theta State was established and was thrilled when a close friend mentioned there was a floatation centre in Bangkok's Prime location, Sukhumvit 24. As a meditation practitioner, floating was something I had been highly curious about. I have floated 5 times now and the experience of floating gets better each time. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for deep relaxation of mind and body. The staff at Theta are friendly and personable. The Lounge area for before and after the float is a great place to chill, read and recollect your thoughts. They provide you with complimentary tea and a healthy snack is available if you're hungry.All in all... a wonderful, one of a kind experience with a great value for money!"

The reception was just great and they made us feel very comfortable and easy. We chose separate options. The pod and the floating room and it was both very comfortable and private.The benefits were just phenomenal. From a physical to mental , spiritual and emotionally and can only rate this place 100 percent awesome. I used the pod for 90 mins and my wife the room for 60 mins and they Co ordinated our time so well that it didn't even feel like we had to wait for each other.I could possibly go on and on about this place but it is the place where you will have your own unique experiences but nothing short of at least having an experience that you will remember for the rest of your life. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly and the environment is just so calm and serene .They also have a snack after your session that I had to get me a pack of.A must do again and the balance this brought into our lives, after just one session or float are just beyond words.keep it up guys and I think I want to own a centre like this in South Africa"

A float center is an island where the mind can withdraw from the business it goes through during the day, and body and skin massaged by the warm saline solution. My feeling is that salts highly contribute in the benefit.So it is great place to soothe one's body and recharge battery. The staff of theta state is available for all needs or quizzing regarding the experience and delicious flower tea is given at the end of the session for our transition time from their womb back to the world of our outer senses .For best experience avoid to load your stomach before your visit and plan quiet time to give some momentum to the weightlessness you will experience then."

Personal attention is given to describe expectations in detail and answer questions on your first visit. Even when busy, clients do not feel rushed or invisible.Every amenity is considered from the welcome tea when you arrive, to the organic body soap and shampoo, and a relaxation area with another warm tea and small energy snack upon completion of the float. The float itself is where the magic happens. Or not. At an absolute minimum (and this is a HUGE benefit in itself), your body will receive the healing benefits of floating in epsom salt, which eases muscle tension and stress. After 10 minutes floating, I was able to experience a complete absence of pain after living with chronic pain for over 8 months. This was an absolute delight and a relief and an emotional release.Being alone with yourself, in the quiet and the dark, floating in what feels like suspended animation can be a balm or an irritant based on all the factors that make up your life. I experienced a wide range of thoughts and feelings while floating. I could label some as \"good\" and some as \"bad\" but really they are neither. I was at peace and then I was agitated. I was calm and then I was emotional. I felt nothingness and then emptiness and then Oneness and then I was irritated. It has taken a couple of days to find words for my experience and, honestly, they are still incomplete. BUT, I've already booked my next float.My best recommendation is to approach your first float, and every float thereafter, without expectation on how it \"should\" or \"will\" be and allow yourself to be surprised by whatever transpires. Rather than force a particular goal, simply be in a state of open curiosity and then settle into it and label it as \"just what you needed\" in this moment.The staff is professional, supportive, kind and courteous in every way."

Seeing that kind of passion makes a huge difference, especially in making you feel comfortable when its your first time floating.I sat down with the owner who did a bit of a needs analysis with me to gauge what i was hoping to achieve, and ensured i was fully comfortable with the process. The float itself was a completely profound experience! i did a 90 minute session, however i completely lost touch with the concepts of space and time! after settling in, i felt myself sitting in a state of awareness, witnessing my mind and body react to having my senses deprived. All that i can say, is that if youre reading this, and youre into topics and concepts such as consciousness, the universe, psychedelics.. you know where im heading with it.. THIS IS A MUST! Take this review as a sign to do it!

While floating, I expected the baby to be very active, but was pleasantly surprised. Since there was no pressure from any side, the baby didn't feel the need to kick or roll around. It was the best rest I've had in several months. I would recommend floating to anyone, pregnant or not, for a time of physical and mental renewal.

But then I told my friend about it, and she came in expecting a sort of brain shutdown and instead had a bit of a trippy experience.

Theta state has great staff and are run by a Thai and American couple that put a lot of effort in making their place upscale, inviting, and of course awesome to float in. They have specials where you buy 2 floats and get a third for free or you can just buy single floats if you're not in Bangkok that long. If you've never tried floating you probably can't find a better place for your first time than Theta State."

Since my wife and I have never done a float before, we thought it would be a novel idea to give it a try.It takes about 10-15mins walk from the Phrom Phong BTS. So remember to cater in some time for that so you can arrive at the center on time. On arrival, we were treated with a cup of herbal tea to calm ourselves down while the friendly staff explains to us what is float and what to expect. We were also shown a video of the whole process so we know what to do when we are in the room by ourselves.For the whole experience, you really do not need to bring anything along, except for your wallet of course. If not, how are you going to take BTS to the place. ;) Once in the pod room, you will be by yourself in full privacy. You must take a shower with their all natural shower gel and shampoo provided before stepping into the pod. It does have an aromatherapeutic effect. After the shower, I put on my ear plugs, off the room lights and start to float in the pod. The staff mentioned the it is impossible to drown in the pod due to the density of the epsom-salted water. So it gives me the confidence to just relax and let the water carry me. The staff mentioned this gives a zero-gravity experience like in space and the body muscle will be in a relaxed, natural position. While in this neutral position, I can feel some ache in the shoulder area. I guess my prolonged slouch in my chair staring at the computer might have contributed to the new \"unnatural\" position that my shoulder is not used to. So I guess I need to make effort to improve my sitting posture from now on.In the pod, you are all by yourself. You can either let all your thoughts go or you can reflect on things that is bugging you with no disturbance from your emails, text and whatsapp disrupting your thoughts. Your will know the session is going to end soon with music. At the end, the pod will announce your session has ended to cue you it is time to step out of the pod, You can shower again to get rid of the salt and use the hair gel and comb provided in the drawers.The float experience is a painless way of relaxation compared to a traditional massage. So I think you might like to give it a go at least to decide if float is for you. Finally, there are big shopping complex at Phrom Phong BTS. We spent half a day there shopping after the float. And we did not feel the soreness we typically felt at the end of the day after the long shopping walk. So the float helps. :)"

Just listen to your own breathing and still your mind. Your thoughts will come like an avalanche and just let them come and know them for what they are \u2014 little squirts of brain activity that don't mean much.One more tip: if you're squeamish about putting your head underwater, buy wax earplugs.

Even so, I was nervous going in, and worried I wouldn't have this intense transformative experience I was expecting.However, the experience was unlike anything I imagined and left me feeling better in ways that I still can't put into words. All I can say is, I was suffering extreme depression in the months leading up to it, as well as a major creative block, and after one hour in the tank (which flew by) it was as if a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I was able to look with clarity at all the negative thinking that had been pulling me down, and see that it was false and unnecessary. I felt so much more balanced emotionally, and okay with everything. And along with that came a flood of new ideas and surge of creativity.I felt like it was a system reboot for my brain. The best part was that this feeling lasted a whole week. Of course after a while the \"high\" leveled out, but the truth of the insights I had from the experience has stayed with me. I plan to go back semi-regularly and would recommend it to anyone. It's worth every baht."

It was one the most relaxing experience that I have ever had. It was a great way to mentally and physically relax. I would highly recommend this place if you would like to get the ultimate relaxation experience. The Center is clean, soothing, calm. The staff is really inviting and caring.

Have been a bit busy and worn out lately, so any excuse to relax sounded like a good idea to me!We booked in and were welcomed warmly by the super friendly owners on the day and offered tea and an overview on what to expect. Decided to go for the room instead of the capsule to avoid claustrophobia, in hindsight was a good idea. The whole process is well managed, the rooms are cleaned and have an air of a posh spa. The experience itself is interesting - bit disconcerting at first and takes a while to get comfortable, but eventually you reach the relaxing bit. I didn't drift off, but my mind definitely wandered and i felt very relaxed (apart from one or two slightly claustrophobic moments). Amazing to float so easily, it's even hard to push your hands below the surface. At the end my skin was all slimy (I guess form the salts) and I felt really energised, rather than sleepy. Was offered tea and healthy fruit balls and had a good chat with one of the owners, a lovely guy. A really worthwhile experience, will be back for sure."

For this trip, we decided to try something different from traditional spa session. We Choose Theta State Float Center. It was a wonder and new experience for us. The staff will explain clearly what to expect and the benefit of this session. We went there during lunch time and entitle for 25% discount. Choose 90 min session using the pod. first 20 min is to get used to the dark and very quiet situation. after you had get used, your mind will be come so relax like you are in meditation form. you may get disoriented if you awake from your sleep but keep calm. After 90 min, i feel my body relaxed and stress free. it like i had done 1 hour of yoga and full body stretching. traditional massage satisfaction are subjective as depend on your masseur. This float can give you exact satisfaction each time if it suit you."

I thought the dark, enclosed space would make me uncomfortable, but not at all. When the music came on to tell me that the session was over, it seemed like only minutes had passed. And the sensation of the water on my skin was unlike anything I've ever known. I really enjoyed my \"Float Pod\" and my friend enjoyed her \"Float Room\" too. She chose the room over the pod because she is a little claustrophobic and the room is a slightly larger space with a higher ceiling. She has chronic back pain and said she had no pain while floating. I slept really well that night and the next morning I noticed that my skin felt surprisingly soft as well. I guess that is the result of the salt water? We tried the 60 minute session and I think I would like to try a 90 minute session next time."

You may find answers to questions that have been prying you, resolve issues, find inspiration...the possibilities are endless in the float tank. My husband & I have done two 60-minute sessions in the pods and a 90-minute session in the rooms last night. The pros:Experience - beyond meditation, a must-try journey into your inner worldStaff - Annile, Joy and Matt are so friendly and welcoming. They embody the spirit of what goes on at a float center by being open, welcoming, genuine. Location - centrally located, easy to access from public transport or by car (parking is free)The con - I can't go every day! I'm 9 months' pregnant and floated for what may be the last time before baby arrives. It was a different experience from the first 2 times, but still enjoyable. Every time I've reached a pure, meditative space that is unlike anything I've felt during sitting meditation."

I have done about 10 floating sessions at the Theta State Float Center and after my 5th session I was convinced I had to get the 20 floats package.It is hard to explain the experience of floating in pitch dark room with absolutely no sound. Some people go into a meditative state. I have not reached that level yet but every time I come out of the floating chamber I feel extremely relaxed and very happy. Like a weight has been lifted off. Even if I fall asleep for 15 or 20 minutes in there, I feel like I have slept for hours. I guess the sleep quality I get in there is just much higher than what I normally get.Theta State is very casual and extremely inviting. Everyone there is so friendly - the staff as well as the other customers. The waiting room is a great area to just chill, have a chat, and have some tea before or after the float.I have the added bonus that Theta State is right next to my house so I go there as often as I can. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to release anxiety and stress, relax, or just simply get some real rest."

The water is the same temp as your body, the music at the beginning and end of the float helps to calm/relax as you start and end your float. The rooms are clean, and the shower has great shampoo/conditioner/shower gel (all natural, and smells great) for you to wash off with afterwards and a nice body lotion too. I'm a little claustrophobic so I choose the float room and it was perfect! The light could be left on (a faint blue light) or turned off and I alternated between complete darkness and the faint blue light. Before and afterwards, a warm cup of tea is provided and a nice relaxing lounge area lets you reflect on the experience and chat with others, for as long as you want. Its cozy, relaxing, and helps ease you back into the outside world. I will definitely come back!"

Sleep is better and yoga feels more joyful. I highly recommend 2 or 3 sessions to get the hang of it. The first try is fun, the second is a lesson in letting go, and by the third try, the body is conditioned to melt like hot butter as soon as you hit the water.

For those of you that have meditated before it's a similar sense of relaxation, but it's amplified by the fact that you are floating in a zero gravity environment. I'll definitely do it again in the future. I live in Yangon and I really wish there was a center here because it's something that I would do on the regular. An experience not to be missed!"

It's one of those rare places where you feel like they've thought of everything, which makes it an ideal place for people who are new to floating. The first time I went, I received a thorough and helpful introduction to the float experience from the friendly staff. That made for an enjoyable float even as a first-timer. I've since been back to float more than ten times, and you always get something new out of it and feel calmer and more centered for several days afterwards. I like the nice little touches like top shelf local organic shower gels and shampoos, and a complimentary healthy snack and tea afterwards. Really just an exceptional place for enjoying the unique experience that is floating in an isolation tank."

Joy the host welcomed me with a nice and genuine smile and gave me a nice introduction to the whole concept. I felt well informed before starting my first floating experience. I loved the delicious tea which was served before the session. I had a one hour session which passed by so fast because I have fallen in trance-like mode. The calming and relaxing music which is played the first ten minutes helps a lot. I felt like in different world. Lost in my thoughts and fully relaxed.After I left the room i felt really recovered and like I would have woken up from a long dream. Annile was waiting in the relaxing room with a big smile and asking me about my first experience which was really nice. The whole environment gives you the feeling that you are sitting with friends at home in your living room. He gave me some interesting facts about the whole process when you are floating and what is happening in your body. I had a wonderful time and felt recharged, ready to get back to my busy life. Thank you very much for that great experience and I will be definitely back!"

Having had no knowledge of floatation tanks before I arrived the owner was extremely knowledgeable and showed a genuine love for the experience that he wanted to share with others. Fully explained the process and what to expect from the experience I opted for the 90 minute session, which turned out to be ideal for me as I really started to feel the benefits towards the latter end of the session. Totally relaxing, i am totally sold on the experience. There is a breakout room that you can relax in afterward and the owner was more than happy to sit with me and discuss how i found it once the session was over. I will be going back the next time I am in Bangkok. Really couldnt reccomend this experience enough"

First time I floated I used the POD and last night I tried the Float Room. I think I personally like the POD as you can stretch out more. However, it does not matter what you choose the feeling after floating is the same... all your cares go away, your body feels so light and when you leave the place its like you are walking on air. I have floated before at various places around the world but this is definitely the nicest. The staff and owners are lovely, they really make you feel at home. Nothing is too much trouble, the place is impeccably clean and has everything you need. If you have never tried this sensation then I would highly recommend it. Go with an open mind and just relax into it. The benefits are enormous."

However having rather exhausted the wats and palaces of Bangkok and in need of somewhere to escape the heat my bf and I went to Theta. And we were very glad we did, neither of us are particularly into meditating or new - agey stuff and but the sensory deprivation was awesome. The whole session is lovely, Aneil one of the owners talked us through the proces over a complimentary cup of tea, you enter into your private room, and have a shower (with some lovely toiletries) and enter into the pod. It takes a while to adjust and it is a very very strange but I experienced awesome sensations and a dream like state. At the end you shower again and go to the lovely chill out room, have another free tea and a snack and discuss your experience. Never thought I'd get as much out of it as I did but I loved it. Go support a new business guys!"

The service is personal and excellent with a pre float briefing and tour. The rooms with pods are perfect containing high quality Siam Botanical products to use. The pods are excellent, spacious, including light music on entry and exit, nice lighting and UV cleaning system. I have been twice, second time was better and I cannot wait for 3rd session. The pod allows you to go into a deep relaxation without the distraction of light, noise, smell and sound. It could be an exploration into inner space, a well needed rest or part of healing as it contains much needed magnesium in the salts. Great as part of a detox or cleanse. I have recommended to all my friends to try it :) Enjoy Natalie"

After the 1 hour float session my muscles felt very relaxed and I felt energized. The epsom salts in the water is really good for helping muscles recover from soreness. As an athlete I do a lot of creative visualization and intuition exercises to prepare for competitions and improve my abilities.

After sipping some (really good) tea and learning all about the benefits of floating, I stepped into what looked like a suspended animation pod from a cool sci-fi movie. Within 5 minutes, I was hooked. It really felt like I was experiencing the absence of all things, including stress. It's hard to explain but to put it simply, I was the most relaxed I have ever been.

Afterward we were so relaxed, we drank tea and sat in the lobby and played guitars and sang. It was a lovely way to relax after running around Bangkok.."

            "review": "Floating in silent darkness. Yesterday, my girlfriend and I visited the Theta State float center on Sukhumvit Soi 24, next to the Davis Hotel. We knew what is was about, but neither of us had ever tried it. Entering, we were greeted by smiling staff and the surroundings were clean and comfortable. They have two types of environments to float in, a pod or a room. The room is bigger, but they are the same price and many prefer the pods. I tried the pod and my girlfriend tried the room. The pod was like an egg, filled with water loaded with epsom salts. I have used epsom salts when injured before, and the idea of soaking for an hour was a great one, promising recovery from stress and injuries. With all lights off and the water heavily salted, my body was very bouyant, and I felt I could relax comlpletely. Ear plugs kept both sounds and water out. People who have done it a few times say their brain can shut down, for complete relaxation, but probably due to the novelty of the experience, I kept thinking the whole time. Coming out, after a nice shower, I felt completely relaxed as I sipped on some tea with honey and talked to the owner and another customer. For those of you wishing for a novel experience and enjoy spas or meditation, I can recommend trying this. Just make sure not to get any of that salted water in your eyes, na. :-)"

Since then really wanted to try it, and now this amazing experience is averrable in down town bangkok on soi 24, just a short walk from the BTS stations.I came after a long day at work feeling tired and worn out. I didn't have too many expectations on arrival. I was made to feel welcome and comfortable by the professional staff. The float lab by itself is very well presented, and with it\u00b4s coziness that brings you in the right state of mind before you enter the of your choice. float pod or float room. I enjoyed the tank experience, it really relaxed me and I am leaving now with a clear head and well \"just totally relaxed\", yet energized as well. Beside that I also feel the benefits from the zero gravity experience, as my back and upper spine got a great \"therapeutic relief treatment\" been in that unique zero gravity environment. Over all enjoyed my experience. And recommend this establishment to anyone."

Adding Floating to my wellness regimen could not have been a better idea.As an athlete, the physical benefits of the magnesium rich water trump any epsom salt treatment out there.As a meditation practitioner, I have not found another state that allows me to access the depths of my mind more easily than floating weightless in the quiet, still, darkness of a float tank or chamber.Nothing helps me clear my mind, allowing profound thoughts and ideas to enter them, more easily.In addition, the space - and the people who hold it for you - are amazing. Annile and Matt are very knowledgeable about floating, and are also very friendly and great for a chat before or after your float. Speaking of which, the atmosphere is perfect for unwinding before your float, and reflecting afterwards. They have dedicated space for both with some of the best tea I've ever tasted on tap, free of charge, as well as the best little healthy snacks I've come across for a very nominal fee.If you've never floated, this is the place to take the dive. You won't regret it."

I can honestly say the whole experience was great - from the friendly welcome, to the pre chill out honey tea, and then the float itself was everything and more than what I expected. You can really feel yourself entering a deep state of relaxation, combined with your muscles unwinding from daily stresses. It feels great for your mind and body.There's so many reasons I would recommend this to people. It's a unique experience in itself but you can really feel the numerous benefits it gives your body. To top it off the staff were great and it really added to the whole experience!"

Having a float center in the middle of Bangkok (Sukhumvit 24 - right next to Davis hotel) is just fantastic!The place is cozy and well planned - with an initial reception area where a cup of herbal tea and introduction (for newbees) take place. There are 4 state-of-the-art float pods/tanks with soothing medation music, lights Etc. I quickly switched all that of to truly get into the \"theta state\" where magic happens mentally and physically.Besides the obvious mental/meditational and rest benefits - I find a float fantastic for recuperation from sports injuries, office back pain, posture and many other benefits.My first float was a great experience - but the following have been even better - so trying at least 2-3 times is recommended.Highly recommended for all!"

It's a fact that meditation yields serious health benefits, but I personally just don't have the patience or ability to successfully meditate. But throw me in Theta State's float chambers, and I'm there! It's as if I experienced a weekend meditation retreat on a serene mountaintop--all after just one hour in the heart of Bangkok! I leave completely de-stressed, energized, and just feel great for about 3 days later. If health and wellness are important to you, do NOT miss Theta State!"

My visit to Theta State Float Center would be my first floating experience...but certainly not my last.After a warm greeting at reception I was treated to a hot cup of tea while the procedure was explained to me in detail, eradicating any confusion or fear, particularly for those nervous in water. The center has the interior of a spa, which for me, makes a huge difference. It separates Theta State from the hundreds of Thai massage parlours that are available and portrays itself, and delivers, as the next level of relaxation.During my float I fell into a trance like state which allowed me to have the most fantastic dreams. Floating through space, conversations with deceased grandparents and an unexplainable sense of happiness were among my favourite. I woke up with a huge smile on my face, feeling like I'd slept for days and a feeling of pure delight at my new discovery.I cannot wait to return!"

My float was not only relaxing, but it was energizing and completely killed my jet lag too! What a great way to start your holiday in Thailand! "

When we float, we are met with an opportunity to observe ourselves, as we withdraw from the world of external experiences to draw our awareness within. The way we respond to our experience, through this hour-long journey home to ourselves, helps us become aware of what needs changing in our life. Learning more about ourselves - our habitual responses and thought patterns - is necessary if we wish to continue evolving as humans. We all wish to continue evolving as humans and this is why floating is helpful."

It was my second time floating ever and this experience was much better than my first (in which I didn't really \"get\" floating and found it boring.) First of all, the facilities at Theta are slick. They've clearly put a lot of time into interior design and over all atmosphere upon arriving. You feel like you've entered into super galactic relaxation spa of the future. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and passionate about what they do. They are there to serve you tea, answer any questions you have, or just leave you the hell alone if that's what you're feeling. The float tanks are rad. They have amazing round white pods (that make you feel like an alien hatching from an egg) and rooms with high ceilings (which are great if you're claustrophobic.) Of the two I recommend the rooms. There are LED lights in all tanks that you turn off yourself to begin your float. If you use the room you'll experience a fun effect where you can see your silhouette against the light on the ceiling. I could have played around in there like that all day.My first float at theta was great for fighting jet lag. I also felt myself \u201cletting go\u201d in a way that I couldn\u2019t seem to my first time floating back home. I enjoyed my experience here so much that I did it again when I came back around at the very end of my trip. The night before I had very little sleep and a long exhausting bus ride. The float was a perfect opportunity to reflect on the past six weeks. When I got out I felt relaxed and rejuvenated, like I had gotten a full nights rest. If you\u2019re traveling through Thailand, I highly recommend sandwiching your experience with Theta state like I did."
