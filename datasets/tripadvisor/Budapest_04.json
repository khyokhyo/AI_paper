By having each side of Budapest on a separate tour I learned much more than the average free tours offer. I had all of my questions answered and I learned fun facts outside of the typical details usually offered."

Our travel agent booked a private 4 hour tour with Adam for us and another couple. He met us at our hotel in the Castle District. Adam shared his amazing knowledge of his city and country through walking and riding the trams. He even booked a private wine tasting with a friend in the caverns underlying the city. So much fun!Adam grew up in this city rich in history as did his parents. So he was able to share very personal stories that we would have not known but for him.We arrived a few days early for our Viking river cruise up the Danube. Make sure you do that as it was well worth our time to spend the time with Adam!Judy and Dean Fraser"

The tour guide, Andrea, was courteous and very knowledgeable. The tour was truly tailored to our wishes and had enough flexibility in it for on-the-spot changes as well. Over the course of two days we got a nice overall impression of Budapest with truly local, insider information. The tailored guided tour also took us off the beaten path to see not just the main touristic sights but the \"real\" Budapest as well, just like we wanted. Andreas dedication to her job and especially her personal touch were much appreciated."

He was able to easily interpret our interest level and packed a wallop of information in a half day tour. One of the best parts of the tour....he asked if we would join him for lunch at a local \"cafeteria\" on the Pest side. What a thrill to be able to eat genuine Budapest food and eat with the locals.Ann & Bob"

I was especially excited that he told me more about my famous family name, Szilagyi and he directed us to a church and square of that name. He even recited a poem about Erzsebet Szilagyi, the mother of King Matthias in whose church I got to sing with my choir. I am a full-time wheelchair user, so traveling can be difficult, but Adam knew exactly where to take us for the best views \u2013 and even knew the best wheelchair friendly rest room location (very important!) I highly recommend him as a tour guide whether you have a disability or not. Susan Szilagyi Borsky October 2016"

Imagine you are going for the first time and alone to Budapest and you find that one of your very good friends was born there and is willing to go with you and show you the sights, sounds and something of the culture of the place, then that is pretty much the the experience that you will get with Andrea Kevei. Her English is very good, her background knowledge is excellent, she asks what sort of things you think you would like to see/do, and sets up a programme to discuss and agree with you. However, she remains very flexible about arrangements throughout the time she is with you."

As a native of Budapest, Adam did more than show us the sights and recite the history of Budapest. Using his family history and his own personal experiences growing up in Budapest, we were afforded a look at the last century's history in this historic city through the eyes of a family that was very much involved. Over two days we were immersed in a culture both similar and different than our own and developed a deep appreciation for the Hungarian culture and people. We consider Adam's tour one of the best experiences we have had in our travels abroad."

I thoroughly enjoyed the walk about in this stunning city but to arrive on their national holiday was a 10* bonus. It couldn't have been better and the city relished in hosting over a million visitors:-) Thank you Adam for your invaluable insight on a terrific day for your country!!!!Eva hosted the Buda part of the walking tour & she delivered it with pride & passion. The views from Fisherman's Bastion & St Matthias Church were incredible. Eva even showed us where she attended school :-) Both guides were so friendly and professional and I would absolutely recommend them to anyone travelling to Budapest or indeed availing of the Budapest Card."

Because of his wide range of knowledge, he went to great lengths to understand exactly what we were interested in seeing and doing. And given we'd spent the day before with a different guide, that removed the obvious tour sites. Originally we were seeking a comprehensive tour with focus on Austro-Hungarian history and Art Nouveau. He delivered! We saw interesting and off the path sites. Adam delightfully shared a couple of stories of how his family experienced the transition from Communism to Capitalism, to life today in Budapest. Very, very interesting.

They say time flies when you are having fun and this was most certainly true of our walking tours in Buda and Pest with tour guide Viki. We were a large geography group of 36 students and when we heard the pest tour was 2 and half hours of walking it seemed a bit daunting for our first activity of the trip. But Viki was incredibly enthusiastic and told us so many great things that it did not seem long at all before we were back at the Deak Ferenc Ter! She was clearly knowledgable and friendly as well as very eager to answer questions, her manner and skill made us excited for the tour Buda which we went on the next day and it was once again Viki who guided us around. This tour was a little shorter but included the great opportunity to see the changing of the guard at the Palace! Viki once again did an excellent job and her amusing yet informative tone in perfect English was wonderful! The whole group gave positive feedback about the tours, so this is vouching for 36 happy students from England! We would highly recommend! The fact it was free with the Budapest Cards was fantastic also, the cards are worth their money, especially when you get two fantastic tours for free included!"

On day 1, Zsofi took us on the tour of outer Budapest on a half-day walking tour. It was a very informative tour, we really saw the sights very well. Not only did we get a great history and culture lesson, but she was a good resource in answering our questions about the city and country and offering suggestions for activities. Very warm and friendly person.On day 2, Adam took us on a tour of the inner part of the city and the colorful Jewish Quarter. Adam has great warmth, a great self-deprecating sense of humor, and a wry wit. The history, particularly from WWII and the Communist period, was fascinating. In addition, his personal and familial connections to many events added unique perspectives to history. He had great suggestions for night life, further touring, etc. Truly an exceptional guide and someone we could be friends with. (No one \"suggested\" a gratuity but we were happy to give one to each guide for good work!)I highly recommend their services!"

We saw much more, including more stops at behind the scenes places, and even stopped for a beer at a wonderful ruin bar.

If you want to learn EVERYTHING (and I mean everything!), there is to know about Budapest by a soft spoken, easy going young man, then Adam is definitely the person to contact (or his company-(behindbudapest@gmail). It was refreshing to see a young person who was so proud of his city and so eager to share his extensive knowledge about the place where he was born and lived his whole life. Adam was like a walking encyclopedia (it seemed like there was virtually nothing he didn't know), and he imparted this knowledge in a friendly, funny & interactive way. He also kept the attention of my children, which sometimes can be hard to do :) Also, Adam shared much personal history with us which made the tour that much more interesting. Even after the 4 hours was over, Adam highlighted for us what to do, where to go, as well as gave us recommendations for places to eat. Our tour with Adam was definitely the highlight of our visit to Budapest!Randi"

He even took great effort in assisting us purchase tickets for the Parliament building by recruiting the some local store keepers (and their laptops).We started in, Szentendre, a charming little town on the banks of the Danube with lots of crafts and a museum containing more impressive sculptures made of Marzipan then you possibly could imagine. Then we moved on to the River Bend itself from an elevated view near the fort (which we opted to not enter). After a small history lesson, we grabbed lunch on the side of Danube. This restaurant served the most delicious grilled Trout! After some well deserved rest, sipping beer and watching a tributary flow just below us from our lunch table, it was on to our next stop. Off the beaten path, Andras shared a hidden spot with us that took us right to the river's edge. It included a short walk through the woods which was enjoyable as well. Finally we made it to a restored mansion for a strawberry wine and homemade dessert tasting. The mansion's owner was a charismatic, jovial guy who was also a friend of Andras. We quickly felt like part of their crew as we hiked up the back yard to the \"tree house\", sharing stories and learning about the walnut trees. We concluded with the wine and dessert tasting and a tour of the house, It was 7:30pm by the time we made it back to our hotel, pleasantly exhausted from the great tour!"

We shared lunch together and I left the day wishing I could spend more time in Budapest. This was my best day of our 12 day European tour ... to Bal\u00e1zs -- thank you thank you thank you! You are so kind + patient and my family loved spending the day with you!!"

We attracted a lot of attention from locals and tourists. Come to find out, these communist cars are quite a collectors item in Hungary. Bal\u00e1zs was an amazing guide with a lot of knowledge. We saw some of the major sites, but he also took us to some \"hidden gems\". Then we went to his parents house for a typical Hungarian meal. Warning: go hungry! His mother is an amazing cook and the food just keeps coming. You don't want to miss a thing! The next day, Bal\u00e1zs to us to Lake Balaton and a winery. It was beautiful! It was great to experience both the city and the countryside. And- enjoy wonderful wines with excellent food.Our experience with My Personal Budapest was excellent. I would highly recommend their \"tours\" (experience)!"

We travel to learn about how connected we all really are. How history changes us all in different ways but ultimately still connected just in a different path of the same branch, from the very same story... In the end, we travel to find ourselves, it's really the story of our lives unfolding. So do all the touristy things for a day or two, then go find My Personal Budapest Tours and get the real story if you care and are hungry for more than just an impersonal tour.We did the Hungarian Soul Tour with Andras and the half day wine tour with Balazs. They were both incredible and we loved every minute of their passion and love for their country. We were struck by how passionate, and soulful the Hungarian people are. It took our breath away even more than the beauty of Budapest and it's top 5 of the most beautiful cities I've ever had the privilege to visit. The only other country we have really experienced that kind of passion is probably Ireland. The Hungarians really have soul. They are a breath of fresh air. We don't normally say for sure that we will go back to a country in the near future, but Hungary is an exception, it draws you back, it stays with you.What I love about Andras and his team, is that they spell out exactly what to expect in their tours, they are organized and professional but still free spirited. I won't explain the tours we did because you can find everything you need on the website. It was incredible. Indescribable beauty, great company, insightful real in-depth conversations, wonderful new friends, fantastic food and wine. What more can you ask for in life? Thank you Balazs, thank you Andras and please tell your mom and dad that we loved their warmth and hospitality. I shall be attempting to make that dish soon that your mom made us. I'm armed with her paprika... We will be back, God willing and when we do, we'll be connected to My Personal Budapest Tours again..."

A little background: The Trabant is a one of the communist cars that was poorly designed, poorly engineered and assembled, yet still had a 10-year waiting list due to soviet \u201cefficiency\u201d. It would be hard to overstate what a P.O.S. this car is. My lawn tractor makes more power than the Trabant\u2019s 2-stroke motor and my college kid's handmade club race car is more refined. The body panels, hood and roof are all made from Soviet plastic and I can\u2019t imagine a worse production car. That said, I absolutely LOVED cruising around Budapest in the Trabant!Budapest is an interesting mix of old-world style and modern touches with remnants of Nazi and communist rule. We trundled through the city in the Trabant with almost rock-star status. The Trabants were such a symbol of all that was wrong with communism that when the Soviet Union collapsed in 89 the Trabants were relegated to the scrap heap of history. A few young, enterprising Hungarians have taken to saving the Trabant and really have made them better than when they were new. All of the attention we got was from locals who were amazed to see such fine examples of the cars on the road. We got to see a lot of the highlight of Budapest, some local hangouts and even a home cooked meal. The slow speed and excellent view from the Trabant allowed for great stories and beautiful pictures. The best part of the experience was the love our guide, Balazs had for Hungary, Trabants and visitors. A great experience!"

He is professional and points out interesting facts and places that we could visit on our own, beyond the usual tourist spots. The tour started off with a overview of the history of Hungary which provided context and an insight into the Hungarian psyche. This was done in a cafe that was a throwback to the 1960s, in a very relaxed atmosphere. The city tour was fairly quick, we spent time at the Gellert Spa ( for just a quick look), the citadel, the great market hall, freedom square and 3 interesting cafes to check out on another day. Although we took sometime at each place taking photos, Andras was patient with us and with my mom who walked at a slower pace. Then off to Andras' parents house for a delicious home cooked Hungarian lunch. This was really the highlight of the tour for me. His parents' hospitality really made us feel welcomed in their home. Such a lovely couple! We were also treated to a private performance of gypsy / Hungarian music which was enjoyable. My mom and I didn't join the walking tour after that but I heard from my husband and son, who did, that Andras took them to some interesting places that most tourists don't get to see or won't know about.All in, I liked the fact that it was a private tour, done at our own pace. Highly recommended for an informative and friendly introduction to Budapest and Hungary."

Andr\u00e1s was a great guide and led us through a number of experiences unlike any other tour we've ever been on -- a discussion of Hungarian history in a quirky cafe, a Hungarian lunch with his family, and even a private concert. The more conventional sightseeing portion of the tour was also well-done, with a separate driver dropping us off at a number of sights throughout the city and picking us up to move to the next sight when we were done. The small group size (ours was 4, maximum of 8) was great in keeping a very personal feel to the tour.We just got home from a five-city European vacation, and the Hungarian Soul tour was definitely my favorite tour of the trip.

This was our 2nd time returning to Budapest and it was our honeymoon, so it had to be a special experience filled with the best people. We had utilized My Personal Budapest for the Trabant tour in October 2015, so when it came time to plan the honeymoon, September 2016 trip, I reached out to the company again, to see if we could hire a driver for our 9 days in Budapest. Attila responded to me very quickly and gave us a very fair price. Each day, he was prompt and showed up a few minutes early to pick us up at our apartment by Parliament. It's a small detail, but I appreciated that his car was always clean and smelled good (I'm a real estate agent, so this is one of those small details that really made it nice!). Since my hubbie and I had already seen a lot of Budapest's historical sights, we turned this more into an eating and shopping tour. Attila was very accommodating and happily took us to any store/mall/outlet mall we wanted to go to. He even set up what we jokingly called the \"Rich Man's Pub Crawl\" for us one night and drove us to the Merkur, The Ritz Carlton, The Aria SkyTop Bar and The Four Seasons where we enjoyed cocktails and light snacks at each of them.... A lot of fun for a night!!! ...not to mention, getting to experience the amazing Hungarian red wines!!!On the day we visited the House of Terror Museum, there were important dignitaries that caused the museum's opening to be delayed. Attila quickly came up with a 'Plan B\" to help us find something else to do, while we waited and then, when we returned, he personally walked us to the door to ensure that we were able to get entrance with no issues. He is just a class act that truly cares...Our last day together, there was a lot of cloudy skies and rain, so we turned that day into a photo shooting day. Attila took us to all the beautiful places and took our photos with our camera and iPhones, in front of the special places. This amazing act of kindness allowed us to have a lot of photos with BOTH of us in them and not just choppy looking selfies. I highly recommend this as an idea for any tourist that is traveling with their loved one(s).... It is so worth the money and you will LOVE having beautiful photos of both of you in front of the amazing architecture that is beautiful Budapest!We are planning our return visit already for May 2017... Attila and My Personal Budapest Tours will definitely be on our radar... Just can't say enough, how truly special he made our honeymoon.... Like a fairy tale... Thank you, Attila!!!! Much Love from Florida,Angie & Kirk"

I was researching various tours in Budapest that met my needs (single woman who has zero knowledge and experience with Hungary), and I happened to come across MyPersonalBudapest via a quick Google search. They seemed to offer everything that I was looking for my trip, and so I contacted the company via email a few months beforehand. I received a reply back fairly quickly from Attila Kiss, and we worked together to come up with a plan and prices for my week in Budapest. Attila not only answered my questions that I had about the tours promptly and thoroughly, but he was also a wonderful guide when it came time for my trip in this beautiful city.Attila was always on time and very accommodating. I initially inquired about tours for single individuals, but eventually one of my relatives decided to join in on the trip and Attila worked out the budget to include and accommodate her as well. We had an amazing time with him! He was very knowledgeable about the city and locations, and whatever he didn't know he did his best to find out for us. He showed us 'secret' places that most tourists miss out on while in Hungary, and he was always hilarious! Attila the Pungarian, is a fit name for this funny tour guide! He was also very gracious and helped me to learn some Hungarian while I was there. Pro tip, a little bit of the language goes a long way!It was a little awkward at first as I had booked Attila for 5 whole days...something that apparently most people don't do, but he made it so fun and amazing that it felt like I was with a friend the whole time. Time flew by during the long car rides to the outer cities, and we never ran out of things to talk about from a range of topics including the long history of Budapest and Hungary to A.I. and Pokemon Go. Attila always did his best to keep us entertained and informed during the tours. We ended up splitting 3 days to explore Budapest as I had specific requests to see certain places and to space out the tours so that we wouldn't be too overwhelmed with the schedule. We also booked the Szentendre, Danube Bend, wine tasting, and Lake Balaton tours...Basically almost everything that the company had to offer, but it was so worth it and everything was personalized to what you want to see and do! Honestly if you have the time and money, spend more time in Budapest and Hungary! I thought it was well worth the money and planning. I felt like I got to really learn about the culture and history of Budapest and Hungary with Attila. From my initial contact with the company to actually meeting Attila in person, everything was handled very professionally and smoothly. He really went out of his way to fulfill my requests for the tours, and I am super impressed with how 'personal' MyPersonalBudapest really is! I will never forget my time in Budapest thanks to Attila, and I would definitely recommend others to contact MyPersonalBudapest if they're looking for a guide in Budapest! I hope to come back again sometime in the future! Thanks again for such an unforgettable trip!"

My wife and I were looking for a personal tour of beautiful Budapest that took in a few major areas but also included a locals view of this wonderful city. We were only available on Thursday and wanted an afternoon tour. Andras hooked us up with his colleague Balazs who offered a unique 4 hour opportunity to see the city from a Communist-era auto called a Trabant. Small but spotless and comfortable (only 2-door) the Trabant drew stares and salutes from the natives and we easily negotiated some narrow streets and found parking where little existed. In addition to the standard tourist narration of major sites, Balazs also imparted to us insight into what it felt like to grow up in a city bursting out following the withdrawal of communism. We also loved seeing the beautiful residential areas, vibrant but off the beaten path. You must be open to a non-typical tourist experience to appreciate the tour, as well as be willing to exit the car at several stops. If you're looking for something different from the large group bus tours THIS is the experience you will remember."

Our favourite parts of the tour were: (1) our lovely and passionate tour guide, Bal\u00e1zs, (2) being driven around in his beautiful vintage car, and (3) the visits to the towns just outside of Budapest. It was a great breather to get away from the city and to see a side of Budapest that we would have otherwise not have gotten a chance to explore without this tour. Bal\u00e1zs was extremely warm and welcoming, and had great knowledge and love for this city. We got to take beautiful pictures of the Danube bend from scenic spot, tried delicious local coffee and cakes, got a brief tour around an artistic town, and even got to step into the grounds of Slovakia. An addition that my family selected to this tour was the strawberry wine tasting. Although the strawberry wines were very unique and were indeed interesting to try, we felt that the inclusion of this was at the expense of the exploration of the small towns. As the tour that I've chosen was a mere one-day tour, it would have sufficed without the supplementary activities (such as: motor boat tours, ceramic workshops, wine tasting, etc.). Although highly interesting, I would personally only recommend these activities to those who are doing a longer tour (spanning a few days), or to those who have a particular interest in them, purely due to the lack of time. Overall, I still highly recommend this tour to anyone and feel that it is suitable for all as they are very flexible and open to tailoring it to your needs and interests."

A short drive from old Buda, Andras took us through to the enchanting countryside north of the country - the charming, artsy Szentendre (with shopping stops if you wish to do so), Esztergom (first capital with its castle ruins), the Szentendre island, all the towns along the way to the famous Danube Bend. Andras showed us the best viewpoints, local stops, and a \"secret spot\" ;). We had lunch at this AWESOME local seafood restaurant. Best grilled trout EVER- so fresh!, but I think my ultimate favorite portion of the tour was when we were introduced to his friend (he showed around his mansion), we also met his sweet mom, who embraced us guests like family. We enjoyed the strawberry wine tastings (I probably had 4 glasses haha) and home-made dessert to top it all off! On our return to Pest, we chanced upon a farmer selling raspberries and garlic along the road..even though we are already way over our schedule, Andras stopped, we got to say hello to the locals and try out fresh raspberries- YUM!

Some of my favourite parts of the tour include:- A great meal in the house of a Roma family where we tasted the local cuisine and learned more about their traditions and culture. - An insightful bus tour that took us to the most interesting sights of the city including some hidden gems. - the knowledge and great stories about the city and the country provided by our guide and the historian that taught us about the Hungarian history.- Free ticket for the parliament tour! worth the visit. Ideal for both solo and small group travellers that want to do more than just enjoy the sights of the beautiful city, but also want to learn what is behind them and how the city evolved and shaped. Especially interesting for people with little time that want to make the most of a one or two day visit! The guides also give you great tips of where to go after the tour is over. Thank you to our guide Andr\u00e1s for a great and insightful visit!"

First, our guide Bal\u00e1zs, what a great guy, knowledgeable, enthusiastic and a very nice chap to boot!Second, the car, a super example of a Trabant, what else for a Budapest tour. This car was clean and fun, lovingly restored and modified by Bal\u00e1zs himself!Don't expect air-con or the hieght of luxury - the whole point of this tour is that it is in a Trabant, so whingers beware!Thirdly, some off the beaten spots with local knowledge thrown in.The only thing we would have changed was the cafe WE chose to stop at, Bal\u00e1zs offered two, a sixties retro place, which was great by the way and if this is your bag, go for it. On reflection we would have chosen the Art Nouveau cafe.Our trip to Budapest was only for three days, not enough in our opinion as there is so much to see and do!That said we are going to go back, before we do we will be contacting Bal\u00e1zs to organise another bespoke tour.Thanks Bal\u00e1zs see you soonSteve and Gaynor"

We did the Danube Bend tour and Attila was both knowledgeable and flexible, We went to Szentendre, a small town with an array of small shops selling local artist pottery and trinkets. Don't miss the miniature museum. We then proceeded to a local \"off the beaten path\" spot. A local beach spot along the Danube river. Our last stop was Hungary's largest Catholic Church. First we crossed a bridge to Slovakia for a vantage point and then back to Hungary for a visit inside. Attila engaged with us, was entertaining and very knowledgable. He shared information about Budapest as well, which was not part of our tour. High recommend."

We toured sights on both sides of the river and ended the tour with an understanding of the city and saw a number of \"hidden\" sights, including a wonderfully decorative roof on the government building that is only visible from the roof of a hotel nearby, and funky bar and open air market buried in the narrow streets of Pest. The tour lasted most of the day and involved enough walking to recommend comfortable shoes and clothes (Budapest can get quiet warm). And definitely bring a camera. The architecture is unique and well worth photographing, and the guide will insure that get all the photo ops that you might want. The tour was tailored to my request provided in advance when booking the tour and we got everything I wanted to see and photograph. Compared to some other private tours I've booked in Eurpoe, I found My Personal Budapest to be of excellent quality and very reasonably priced."

You start off in a cafe to hear about history for over an hour. One drink included. Then we got into a very hot van and rode around to see sights that Hungarian people don't like. We saw one monument that they liked. Then we got into the hot van, windows up with an AC that was terrible drove for over 30 minutes to eat lunch at 2 or 3:00. Needless to say we were starving. Loved the couple who had us in their home and food was great. We just wish it would have been closer. Then we drove over 30 minutes back to listen to a gypsy band. We felt uncomfortable in the small room with just a band playing. I will tell you that the idea & people are 5 star but the actual tour was a 1 star. The reviews they have online was not for this actual tour. I just want to state again we did like the people not the actual tour. Also there was only one hidden treasure a bookstore cafe that we ended our tour in. I do give George & Gizzy who had us in their home 10 stars."

Yes, you feel the Soul of Hungary starting with the warm welcome of the guide, the humor and knowledge of the 'historian', the love of the home cooked meal and the passion of the Roma concert. The tour is probably more for someone who has seen the tourist highlights already but wants to get closer to the people. It is a very personal tour and the guide Andreas, was a pleasure to spend the day with. Lots of laughs, a few tears and many hugs. I traveled with my husband, 2 sons, ages 35 and 29 and a daughter-in-law. We all thought the tour was amazing."

For various reasons on my side, I had to communicate with Andras multiple times by phone and by e-mail and he was always responsive. Andras picked us up at our apartment right on time and as he drove us to Szentendre, he talked about Budapest and its history, the areas we were passing through and the history of Szentendre. We had a great time with Laszlo and Gabriella during our private ceramics lesson. They were so welcoming. We were also able to purchase some of Gabriella's beautiful ceramic items to take home. Next, we went into Szentendre proper, but while Andras showed us the usual tourist shops, we spent minimal time there, instead going off on side streets, eating traditional Hungarian langos, a fried flatbread. After a visit to the Baroque-Rococo Greek-Orthodox Blagovestenska church and the amazing Marzipan museum, we were off to Visegrad for amazing views of the Danube Bend. Andras also took us to visit his 'secret' spot which unfortunately was a little flooded, but still beautiful. One of the highlights of the afternoon was visiting a trout restaurant A Pisztrangos in Visegrad, a restaurant for locals, serving only trout. Delicious! We each ate every last bit of our fish. We went up near an old castle for some more amazing Danube views and then Andras dropped us off to catch the ferry back to Budapest. We were treated to more beautiful views of the countryside from the water as we traveled home after a wonderful day. Thanks you, Andras, too, for recommending the Budapest Bistro. We had a great dinner there."

Not so on this tour! I paid using PayPal, it was easy. This tour started understandably at the beginning...by reviewing the City's history and events over coffee/tea at the \"Communist Caf\u00e9\" a qwerty and unique place with 1950's radios, TVs, and other in the windows, all over the Caf\u00e9 was fun memorabilia. After the history we discussed what we wanted to see and by air conditioned mini bus visited the Market, Gell\u00e9rt Spa, and Chain Bridge. We made 4 stops and a highlight was the magnificent architecture of Hotel Gell\u00e9rt and its Spa, and the views from on top of Buda. I should mention that although there is a plan you have a vote.We admired the amazing view of the city from the Citadel and got off for a short walk on Liberty Square and also in the City Park. Photo opportunities were everywhere we went.The next thing we did was a big surprise and the four of us really enjoyed it...we had a lovely Hungarian lunch in the home of a Hungarian family, which means we met with friendly and progressive Hungarians in their own home as well as enjoyed traditional Hungarian cooking in a relaxed atmosphere. The food was amazing and none of us needed dinner that night! On our drive back to downtown Budapest after lunch we enjoyed some heart-warming melodies from Liszt and another Hungarian composers. It was a private concert!We visited some places that have been left out of guidebooks as well.This is a ~8 hour tour, some walking, some bus, we got a tour of the city and afterwards we were prepared to venture out on our own. Don't worry if you are on a cruise to Budapest, this tour will not duplicate your tour.I would call this tour relaxing though. I never felt rushed. That is rare among tours in Budapest. This is the best tour in Budapest, look no further."

Andras's parents were very gracious, and the food was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed it, and it gave us an insight into Hungarian daily life. Another highlight was a private concert by five Roma musicians performing Hungarian music. They were accomplished musicians, and we were moved by the soulful sounds of their music. We made a stop at a retro communist cafe and had a interesting slide presentation with commentary by a student of Hungarian history. Other more conventional tour stops included the Gellert Baths, the Citadel, the Opera House, a secluded city park square, among others. Andras was very knowledgeable, and his English is excellent. At no time did we feel rushed during the tour. It was very relaxing and interesting, and utilized both van transportation and some walking. Best tour we had in Budapest!"

All we had to do was let Andr\u00e1s know what we had already seen and he formulated a tour just for us. It started out having a conversation with an expert on Hungary's history at a unique coffee house. He took us places that we would have never seen as they were not the usual \"tourist\" attractions. We had a wonderful dinner with his parents in thier home. They really went all out to set a beautiful table and the food was scrumptious. Then we all (parents included) went to a concert just for us by a group of gypsy musicians and it was entertaining and educational. One of the musicians gave us a history of gypsy music and it was so interesting. They were great. I didn't mention that we also received free tickets to the Parliament from Andr\u00e1s and visited it the day before. Wow, what a building! We had a tour guide who spoke English very well and gave us an amazing amount of information. Don't miss touring the inside of the Parliament building. I would recommend this My Personal Budapest because it didn't feel like 10,000 facts and/or dates spewed out by a guide that had a memorized a script. My mind tends to \"turn off\" when people talk that way. It was an 8 hour tour I believe and well worth the money."

When I tried to book on his site, he had different offerings at the time and I chose a personal tour but I see he has since changed his website and no longer offers what I originally wanted which was the Trabant tour around the city. He convinced me to take this tour instead and now realize why. We first went to a coffee shop for an hour long history lesson. After 30 minutes, we had enough. His guide was very nervous and the whole thing was way too long to be indoors on such a beautiful day. We rode around the city on a bus and then went to his house for lunch. The food was okay. This was the only highlight. The 2 hour music concert, again indoors, was nice but way too long. If this was outside we could perhaps have tolerated it better. Sadly, we are not fans of classical music. Overall I would recommend this if you don't mind sitting for long periods and have a greater appreciation for classical music."

This was an all day tour that took us to Szentendre, Visegrad, and Esztergom and also a winery in Eyek. It was a full day but we never felt rushed and we really enjoyed the scenery while driving to the destinations. While in Esztergom, we had lunch at a great local restaurant. Balazs was a fantastic guide and gave us a wonderful history of Hungary. It was my husband's and our friend's first tour in Hungary, I have been before but found out far more information from Balazs than I did a few years ago. Balazs also stropped at a local bakery for some yummy bread and desserts. It was great! The highlight was the winery. I can't begin to explain how happy i was I added this on. It was a beautiful vineyard and the staff was wonderful and the cheese plate was out of this world. The wine was to die for! It was simply one of the best tours I've ever been on and I have been on many. They also have the cutest dog on the property but sadly, I have forgotten his name but he is the most adorable French Bulldog that loved to play. We all just loved Balazs and felt like we walked away with a new friend. So grateful to him for making this such a memorable day for us. I highly recommended getting out of the city if you have the opportunity and take this tour!"

My mom and I took the Soul of Hungary tour with Andr\u00e1s and his company My Personal Budapest. I have lived and played in Europe since 2001, I have been on numerous tours in numerous countries and by far, the Soul of Hungary tour has been the very best. It was a small, intimate tour with just two other people, both of whom, I am sure enjoyed the tour as much as we did. Andr\u00e1s made us feel as though we weren\u2019t just tourists, but long-lost family, getting reacquainted with our homeland. We met in the Astoria district and took an informative walk to a beautiful park, the Karolyi Kert (where Andr\u00e1s grew up and played!), and then onto an amazing caf\u00e9, called the T\u00e1skar\u00e1di\u00f3 Eszpressz\u00f3 B\u00e1r and Bisztr\u00f3. Here we watched a presentation given by a wonderful speaker whose name I have, unfortunately, forgotten, but it gave all of us a wonderful overview of the amazing history of Hungary and Budapest. After this refreshing break, we boarded a van and headed out to the major sites. Although we didn\u2019t stay long at each of the sites, our morning was filled with history and words\u2026 Words that gave us an insight to how Hungarians see themselves and what they think the world thinks of them. After the morning tour, we headed to Andr\u00e1s\u2019 parents\u2019 home for a lovely four course luncheon. We were warmly greeted by his parents and had an aperitif to get our gustatory juices flowing. (Andr\u00e1s was kind enough to send me a repertoire of his friends Hungarian recipes, many of which I have been chomping at the bit to try!) The reception and hospitality that his parents gave felt like a warm hug, I certainly could not have asked for more. I feel fortunate to have experienced their loving home!After luncheon, we headed back into the Budapest proper to the Jewish Community Center behind the famous Opera House on Andrassy ut. Once there we were treated to the most amazing and spectacular Romany Gypsy Music concert. For me, this was the most marvelous and best part of the tour. Yes, eating with Andr\u00e1s\u2019 family was beyond my expectations and visiting all the famous sites and learning about the colorful history of Hungary was far beyond fabulous, but the music portion of the day completely took me by surprise and moved me to tears. I was so touched by this particular experience that I forgot to buy the CD! Andr\u00e1s, if you read this, I need a CD by those artists!!The Soul of Hungary tour is, without a doubt, singularly, the very best tour of any European/African/Asian tour I have ever been on. So much so that I will be returning to Budapest with my husband and son and will be taking another tour with Andr\u00e1s!"

I did some canvassing on private tours and My Personal Budapest had the best rates so a few days before, I booked the tour with them. It is a 5 hour car tour flexible to your interests and needs. I was traveling with my mother who is a PWD and my sister. Balazs, our tour guide was awesome, he usually does the tour with a Trabant but upon telling them my mother's condition, he was considerate to borrow his parents car with a large legroom that was more comfortable. Balazs was a gracious host eagerly sharing the city's rich history, architecture, cool spots and markets. Next time around I will book the Trabant or walking tour. I recommend this tour for those with special needs or want to go at their own pace."

But Andras did not disappoint with the back up plan. He was completely flexible and drove me around on a private tour of all the major sites and some of the lesser known ones, including some great cafes and the Hospital in the Rock museum. Andras is very passionate about his city and loves to share his vast knowledge of both modern and contemporary history. Had a great day!"

Our tour guide Balazs was very personable and also very knowledgeable, not only about Budapest but also about the history and culture of Hungary and its stand in current world events. He was very happy to tailor and adapt the tour, and as we had been to the Christmas market the night before we were able to shorten our time there and add time elsewhere. The cultural center was informative and fun as we made our own traditional Christmas decoration, we walked the chain bridge, saw parliament, made our own chimney cakes at the Christmas stall, had a private organ performance in a church, visited a retro cafe, walked the Jewish quarter, and all the time Balazs kept us well informed and engaged with information, answering our many questions about Budapest. It was a fantastic introduction on our first day in this beautiful city.We used public transport which was covered in the tour cost, and helped us get a feel for the system. We were so impressed with our guide Balazs that we booked a second tour a few days later in his restored trabant car."

We elected to do a day trip combination tour of 'Christmas Tour and Hidden Gems' on foot. This was my request and not one specific tour. Having seen so many Christmas markets already we did not wish to be too immersed in the Christmas hype. Our guide was Balazs. Initially I was worried as we did not have a tour with the owner Andras. Within seconds I realised there was nothing to worry about. Balazs was absolutely WONDERFUL! He responded to all our requests on the day, was incredibly attentive and patient and absolutely to be recommended. We enjoyed a visit to a Hungarian small museum/craft/place where I think many school groups visit. The Christmas tradition was explained by a local girl with Balazs translating. We even made traditional Christmas decorations and certainly laughed a lot. Of course this is not for everyone, but we really enjoyed it. We also had a private organ recital in a tiny church-just for us. We were able to talk with the organist about his role etc. This was really informative and beautiful. The day also included many other highlights- local cafes unknown to most tourists, the Jewish Qtr etc. Balazs was so incredibly knowledgeable about his country and he shared a lot with us. My recommendation is to email many questions and really find out what your tour involves as these guys are very helpful and do everything they can to make your special trip totally worthwhile. Actually we loved it so much and thought Balazs was so good, that we also did a half day Trabant tour with Balazs on our last day in Hungary. We drove out to Szentendre in his fully restored unique (to us) car, and enjoyed a relaxed visit at our own pace before heading to the International airport to go home. We would all definitely recommend My Personal Budapest and Balazs. THANK YOU!"

My husband Neal and I were visiting Vienna over the holidays and we decided to do a side trip to Budapest, making a roundtrip via train in one day. For our time in Budapest we selected the Trabant tour, which was both informative and fun. Our guide, Bal\u00e1zs, was very personable. It was great getting a view of Budapest from someone who is fluent in English, knowledgable of its history, and personally connected to its destiny. Going via Trabant was quirky--it is a small, very basic antique car--but this added to the fun. It was actually very cool that Bal\u00e1zs owns the car and maintains it. As a result of the tour we not only got a great overview of the city, we also made a resolution to revisit Budapest in the future and spend more time there."

I also asked my guide, Attila, to make his focus on what I needed to know to begin to understand Hungary, which is not an easy job for a country with a long and sometimes painful history, and he did that very well.I thought that the mix of driving by and looking at some places and getting out and walking around or going in others briefly was a good balance, and I knew a lot more when we finished than I did when we started. And I am motivated to find a good history of Europe and learn more.I was impressed with the flexibility the company offers when I saw their web site, and with Attila as we organized the day. In additional to concentrating on Hungarian history as I requested, he recommended a nice little restaurant for me to visit for lunch at the end of the tour, he suggested that since I seemed to be interested in history that I might want to spend the rest of the afternoon at the Terror House, and he took me to the train station to pick up an advance purchase train ticket from a vending machine that I thought might give me trouble because the directions would be in Hungarian only.If I were in Budapest again, I would definitely take another of their tours and I would ask for Attila."

We had booked 8 hours (two tours) with the company to run consecutively on our first day in Budapest.(highlights of the city and hidden gems) Unfortunately our flight to Budapest got cancelled and we reached Budapest only in the latter half of the proposed day. We texted Attila to let him know and he was kind enough to agree to just half day tour starting 2 pm when we would reach hotel. Firstly, this tour is not cheap in any way and to our utter surprise, we were charged for full 8 hours and not half. I am not sure which culture and norms presumes you have to pay full price for a half job but it sure does not where I come from. There is a name for it and its called \"dishonesty\". And it doesn't end there. When I asked what to pay at the end of the tour, I was told a figure 10 Euros higher than the agreed upon price (the company has no prices on its website and all prices are agreed upon by personal emails with client, at least it was with me) and then told, since we didnt do the whole 8 hours, we are being given a discount of 10 Euros. This really took the cake. We did not want to get into any arguments (which we totally could have) and paid the full price which really stung for less than half the tour delivered. Now for the actual tour:I dont know what the original plan for our tour was but as it stood, I believe a lot could have been achieved in around 4 hours but it was mostly driving to stuff and seeing it from outside in a very very rushed manner. If I wanted that flavour, then I would have booked a Viator/coach/group tour. The reason one books a private/personal tour is so that the pace can be casual and more personal but we felt like we had to rush everywhere while seeing each thing for 5 secs. 4 hours is less than what we hoped for too, but it was still a lot if it was well planned. Personally, there could have been less NUMBER of sites in a good pace than running around ticking things off a list- probably because the plan was to charge for full 8 hours and that would make a better argument.I am not sure if what do do with us for 4 hours was at all planned, we rushed around a lot and when I requested a coffee stop I almost regretted it because we spent around 15 mins looking for a coffee shop (yes!!) that had suitable parking. Arentt these the sort of things you assume your \"private and personal\" tour would entail? Our guide was Attila and he was a nice enough person and we had good conversation with him, this review is not a personal vindication against him (seems many other people liked him from other reviews) but rather a statement of facts from our actual experience which for which we paid very steeply and were quite disappointed. We booked another private tour in Budapest the next day and thankfully it was wonderful so I would recommend considering other companies rather than this one when booking your Budapest tour, else you can be out of a lot of money with no real value."

This is the real advantage of the tour, you have a local guide who can taylor the tour to your needs. Bal\u00e1zs is a genuine enthusiast with an encyclopaedic knowledge of Trabants. He also knows how to drive one, and treated us to some amazing videos of him driving one of his collection on two wheels! After the tour of Budapest we drove into the countryside to a local wine producing region. Here we were given a tour of the cellar from our brilliant and knowledgeable host. The wine tasting was brilliant, with some excellent sauvignon, chardonnay and local varieties. This was followed by an equally wonderful lunch before being driven back to our hotel.I couldn't recommend this company enough, they have the knowledge and skill to provide a brilliant, bespoke tour. The Trabants are great fun and a practical way to see this beautiful city. If you're a petrol-head it's a must. The wine tour complements the Trabant tour well and both the food and wine were better than I expected."

The first was the presentation by a young PhD student on the history of Hungary in a Communist-era cafe. It was well-paced and used multimedia presentations to good effect. Following that we did some sightseeing that was tailored specifically for us based on what we had already seen. The second was a meal with a local Hungarian family. We enjoyed traditional food and Christmas cakes. The other was a private concert for our group by an ensemble of 5 Hungarian Gypsy musicians, who were excellent.

Next we boarded a small bus for a driving tour that included many stops that were not included in the Viking itinerary I previosuly provided Andras - some timely planning and customizing! We drove out of the city for lunch at his parent's house and were served a wonderful meal, along with some real conversation with his parents. Next we drove to a local meeting facility and were treated to a great performance of \"gypsy\" music by a group of professional musicians that are talented enough to perform anywhere. We ended with a visit to a \"ruins\" bar and a walk back to our hotel - a full day to be sure.My main complaint was the time we spent on the bus. If this tour included less \"bus time\", I would give it 5 stars for sure. Also, I would recommend you keep your group to 6 or 8.

We started the day in a coffee shop and had an interesting and informative talk from a local historian which really helped us to understand the history of Hungary. We then toured the city in a comfortable mini bus and visited the main sites of interest. We then went to the home of Andras parents for a home lunch. They made us very welcome and we had a delicious home cooked meal.We then went to a concert hall and has a private concert which was surreal. Amazingly talented ensemble. We ended the day in a ruined pub in the old Jewish quarter. Overall a full day with lots of wonderful experiences."

We visited several of the most important sites in Budapest, as well as some of the hidden gems, that we would never have known about otherwise.

With no power steering and frequent re-starts, Attila made it look easy driving around the city.

There is so much history in Budapest, it's impossible to get bored hearing about their rich past.

We can all find the highlights ourselves via the internet but what makes travel truly memorable is a window into the culture, its people and the history that shapes its society. Our first day was spent in memorable little Trabant cars, a throwback to East German engineering. This would merely be silly except for the fact of the loving attention given these classic \"peoples' cars of communism\" by young Balasz. These cars generate so much local goodwill and nostalgia, Balasz is so knowledgeable about them, and we got the added bonus of his Dad as additional driver and window into local society. They provided lovely guidance into out-of-the-way corners of local woods, street foods and Estergom's beautiful cathedral and overlook. That was great fun! Andras then showed us his own Budapest. We got the \"Soul\" of his city first with a concise exposition of Hungarian history and then a peek into some more contemporary events like the failed revolution against the Russians. We also got a taste of quirky Art Nouveau architecture and things like an old casino now housing a very modern cafe. Top of the list, though, was the intimate meal with Andras' parents! That will NOT happen on the big bus tours, obviously. A real family, a real traditional meal, real local plum brandy! What's not to like? This is a five star experience delivered by five star guides. Really worth EVERY forint we spent. Thanks A LOT, Andras, we loved every minute and thirsted for more!Mariette, Stephen, Lynnette and Han"

The city itself, along the Danube is just wonderful. It is worthy of the time and effort to visit this city, one of the greatest ones in Europe. We have been to Paris, Madrid, Lisbon, Rome, Lucerne, Vienna, Venice, Malaga, Granada and Milan among others. It ranks right up there with the best. However, for us the highlight was to be able to photograph it at night. In looking for a tour that would accomplish this I corresponded with a guy named Balazs for some time and he assured me that he would do everything possible to make the tour exactly what we wanted. My partner is quite good at night time photography. Originally I had planned for us to just spend one day in Budapest, coming by boat from Vienna. But he had read, and rightly so that Budapest is the most beautiful city in Europe to photograph at night. So Balazs, our guide picked us up in his Trabant, an East German car. He is very proud of his unusual automobile, which incidentally he restored himself. Anyway, I get side tracked. He met us at the Iberostar Hotel at 7pm (He was actually a little early) and the first stop was Vajdahunyad Castle and Hosoktere or as we would say \"Heroes Square\". He thought it important that we see this important landmark, even though it wasn\u2019t yet quite dark. From there we ventured to the Parliament Building, among the most beautiful found anywhere, up to the Matyas Church, to another hill to capture the whole of the cityscape and finally to St. Stephen\u2019s Basilica. Along the way he pointed out the Opera House, the Secret Police Museum, the Chain Bridge, etc. He loves his country and gave us an interesting perspective on the changes that have taken place since the fall of communism in his country. He is an enterprising young man with big dreams, a wonderful personality and a love for his country and city. This tour was truly the highlight of our time in Budapest, but it was not the only highlight as we enjoyed the people, the food, the spa and the monuments, especially the Shoe Monument along the river very much. We didn\u2019t know much about Budapest before going except that it was very beautiful. It is that, but it is so much more. We enjoyed our time there very much and would encourage others to journey to see it as well! If you do though, make sure you hook up a tour with Balazs at My Personal Budapest Tours!!!!"

Balazs was our host/driver and was very knowledgeable about the city and surrounding areas. Touring the city in the old Trabant made for a unique and fun experience. Balazs easily adjusted our tour plans the morning of pickup to exclude places we had toured earlier in the week. This flexibility made the most of our time to tour other cool places. The Hungarian lunch option was absolutely amazing! We met Balazs' parents Janos and Maria who welcomed us to their home and served us an excellent meal with great beverages. We shared a lot of laughs with them. We thought the lunch experience would be too awkward but after meeting the parents it was totally relaxing and one of the better parts of the day. Janos even treated us to a sip of some fine Hungarian fruit liquor - very nice! As a bonus, Balazs drove us back to the city in a different vintage car, an old 50's Opel. What a blast! Balazs is a truly talented and personable young man who has great love and passion for old automobiles (even fixing them!). I give the tour experience an A+++.

The first day was in a vintage communist car called a Trabant and it was great driving around the city while attracting the attention of many locals who remember having those cars. The tour to all the city attractions was very informative, personalized, and Balazs was terrific. He is extremely knowledgeable, professional and caters to whatever you would like to see---in other words, he is very flexible and tries to make every tour a little bit different by gearing it to what his clients tastes are. The city tour was followed by lunch at his home with his lovely mother doing the cooking. It was fantastic!!! His mother is a great cook---several different types of h'ors d'ouevres accompanied by wine, beer and some Hungarian liquor was how lunch was started. This was followed by a most delicious tomato soup and baked chicken with potatoes and vegetables. The meal ended with a layer cake that looked wonderful but I was too full at that point to continue eating. After lunch, we resumed our tour with the hidden gems of Budapest which included some ruin bars, interesting neighborhoods and a bit of shopping. This tour was well paced and very enjoyable. I would highly recommend it. Day two with Balazs was out into the countryside in another vintage car to the Danube Bend and the town of Szentendre. Beautiful scenery and the artists' town of Szentendre is very interesting and full of charm. He then brought us back to our hotel to drop off packages (from shopping we had done) and dropped us off at the wine festival near the Palace (which was incredible with over 200 vintners). He didn't have to do this as the tour had concluded but he is just such a kind, wonderful person who wants all his clients to enjoy the most they can in his wonderful city. Balazs has a lot of passion for both his city and his business. I don't think you could ever go wrong hiring him as a guide in Budapest.

We particularly like the ruin bar (and there was the freak market going in that day when we visited), Jewish ghetto wall, and the morning coffee break at the local cake shop, tasting some beautiful traditional Jewish cakes.He has also taken us to some secret hidden spots like the cafe inside the book shop and the roof top bar with 360 city view. Before he left us for the day, he also helped us plan and showed us many other places to visit on the map. We have enjoyed the few hours we spent with Balazs L.The next day we were supposed to do the Danube Bend with Andras. He emailed us a few days earlier saying the weather forecast might be bad so he suggested to stay in Budapest. After a few emails, we decided to push our tour a few days later. I think it's the best decision we have made. The three towns Szentendre, Esztergom and Visagrad are beautiful in their own ways. The most enjoyable would have to be the ceramic workshop with Gabriella. She is friendly, personable and really patience with us making a mess of the clay. We did not want to leave her workshop.But the most special has to be Andras' secret spot. We promised him not to mention as it won't be a secret anymore.

After admiring the tiny two-stroke engine and a hot wired air-conditioner that would make any hacker proud, we drive off to see the sights.Balazs and Peter\u2019s tour takes us through all the right neighborhoods, with stops for photos and walks and excursions at all the right places: the Chain Bridge, Castle Hill, the Matthias Church, the Fisherman\u2019s Bastion, the zoo. Along the way, we notice how Peter\u2019s Trabant delights everyone we drive past, from locals (who still feel a nostalgia for the cars) to tourists (who have never seen anything quite like it). Peter\u2019s car makes everybody smile \u2014 including us. At lunch, Peter drops us off in the Jewish Quarter, but Balazs stays with us, taking us to a Sunday market in Budapest\u2019s best-known ruin bar, a tasty lunch at Karavan (a block of food stalls), a stroll by the Tree of Life at the Dohany Street Synagogue, a walk through Heroes\u2019 Square, a visit to a controversial monument (with a magical fountain), a photo op outside Parliament, and a tour through St. Stephen\u2019s Basilica. It\u2019s a fact: Balazs makes every minute of our day better. He\u2019s smart. He\u2019s flexible. He has a dry sense of humor. He\u2019s easy to be with, so you feel less like you\u2019re on a tour and more like you\u2019re just hanging out with a local friend. He knows Budapest in the way only locals can know it.Could we see all these sights on our own? Of course. But we couldn\u2019t see them as efficiently as we see them with Balazs, who gets us from A to B as smoothly as possible. He also gave us tips on how to organize our next day \u2014 confirming my choice of the Rudas Baths as the best way to Budapest\u2019s bath culture and reserving a scenic sunset cruise on the Danube for us.Balazs also has a gift for mixing conversation with quick, natural little stories about the history of each place. Instead of lecturing, he brings up significant dates and important facts in a relaxed and casual way. He also shares his personal history: his memories of the Communist period, his family\u2019s life in Budapest, and what it\u2019s like to live in Budapest every day with his wife and two kids.So we see Budapest \u2014 and we also see Balazs\u2019 Budapest, through his eyes. And that\u2019s something you can\u2019t get from any crowded river cruise bus tour or any guide book. Put this personalized tour first on your list of things to do, and you\u2019ll feel right at home in Budapest for the rest of your trip."

Our group of six people took two all day tours with Andras(Andy) from My Personal Budapest..Both days we were picked up at 9:00AM, one we walked or took public transportation, the other in a van. First day we combined the Hidden Treasures and the Culinary Tours. We really enjoyed walking through this beautiful city, seeing the beautiful architecture and learning history about the different neighborhoods, something you would not see on the typical bus tours. During our walk we stopped at a coffee house. For lunch we stopped at a restaurant where Andy ordered six different dishes that all of us were able to share. After more touring we stopped at another restaurant for dessert of many delicious tasting strudel dishes. The next day we took the van on the Danube Bend Tour. Our first stop was the beautiful town of Szentendre were we walked and saw this quaint little town, saw several different sights including the church and Miniature museum, and again stopped for a quick drink and food in a coffee house. Because the rain prevented us from Andy's Plan A, we switched to Plan B and went to Esztergom to visit the cathedral after we had lunch. Prior to our visit inside the church we went over the border into Slavakia for a panoramic view of the basilica. Since Andy is a native of Budapest his knowledge of the city and countryside was so informative, that we learned quite a bit. He is friendly and personable and we all felt \"at home\" with him. Thank you for an experience we all enjoyed and will remember."

Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Budapest."

Balazs was very informative and is obviously very proud of his wonderful city. We had chatted about the education system and compared it with our daughter's and Balazs even took us past his old school and pointed it out - helping to really make her part of the day and involved.If you are at all nervous about the home lunch then don't be. You don't feel like an intruder but are welcomed as friends. The welcome from Balazs' parents is so very warm, the food fantastic and taking a drive out of the centre of the city is really interesting. They had even kindly prepared a child-friendly back up meal in case the more traditional food wasn't so appealing to our daughter.After Budapest we were visiting other parts of Hungary and Balazs gave us hints and tips on places to go.I cannot recommend these tours highly enough and they will be the first recommendation that I make to anyone I know that is planning a visit to Budapest."

Next time we come here (and we'll definitely be back) calling up Andras will be the first thing we do. I sent an email inquiry about the tours we were interested in, and the time we had remaining for our stay. He replied saying that as we had already visited a lot of the nearby sights that are a must for any visitor, he suggested that we take the Hidden Gems tour for one of our excursions.Andras promptly met us a the scheduled time, and off we went on our walking tour. We walked, and used the tram and subway to visit many interesting and intriguing sites: a beautiful secluded park; a cafe decorated with actual furnishings from the Communist period; another elegant and ornate cafe that served as a hangout and meet up spot for writers and poets years ago; a hotel's rooftop terrace with SPECTACULAR 360 degree views of the city; Liberty Square where you can find an American President strolling up to meet you; an art nouveau building with intriguing decor inside and out; a little known spot with the last surviving portion of the wall around what was the Jewish Ghetto from WW2; and a final stop at one of the famed 'ruin pubs'. Our second day, to a winery in nearby Etyek, was equally fun. Andras picked us up in his car for a 30 minute drive outside the city. We were met by the owner of a family run vineyard in the countryside. It was a perfect day, sunny and picturesque. Inside a contemporary tasting room, we gazed out at the vines, while sampling 5 wines and enjoying cold lunch platters of meats, cheeses, tomatoes and bread. The owner shared how his winery started, the joys and challenges of the business, showed us his wine press, and cellar where barrels of wine were aging. All along the way to these various sites, Andras provided a wealth of information and fun facts. As your tour progresses (and it won't take long), you'll feel more and more like you're with a friend, not just a guide. Andras has a very easy going personality, and a great sense of humor. His knowledge of Hungarian history is evident as he describes the sights, and relates the various political events and circumstances in his commentary. One thing you will definitely be aware of is his pride in, and love for, his city. Let him share that with you, you will be pleased."

As we were picked up at our hotel the fun started straight away. 3 Trabants waited for us, and so many people stopped and took pictures. The cars are just excellent, we were having so much fun, laughing and taking pictures of each other and The highlights of Budapest. We were the attraction and people were taken more pictures of us (the cars) than we were taking of the attractions. Highly recommended."

Since there were 5 of us his father was with him to drive one of the two Trabants. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable about the history of Hungary. We started at Heroes Square with a lecture about monument and points of interest surrounding the area. From monuments to churches to coffee houses we were thoroughly delighted. We enjoyed driving through the city in the cars, with people taking our picture and waving as we went by. After touring both Pest and Buda we were off for lunch at a \"locals\" home. We were warmly greeted by the couple at their home and made to feel as if we were eating at our own home. The table was beautifully set and the food was magnificent - as was the wine! Thanks so much for a fun day and great overview of Budapest!"

Attila told us stories of different times in the history of Budapest and Hungary, that no one has told us before. We ended near our hotel at a beautiful care for coffee and more tales of Budapest.

It was so interesting to hear the personal stories of life in Budapest throughout the years and learn the history of the country.

When he informed us just before the event that Balasz would be our guide for the day, we were somewhat disappointed. But it all turned out to be the best tour we ever had on our extensive travels! Balasz is an exceptional tourguide: young, enthusiastic, energetic, intellegent, knows his city and country very well, has a delightful sense of humour, has very well informed and balanced opnions about anything and everything (including his Trabants!). We forgot something in his beautifully restored 1965 Volvo, and this created the opportunity to meet with Balasz and his family again. Not only did we spent a most informative and enjoyable day with Balasz in countyside, but also created special fond memories by meeting and spending time with his family.We highly recommend without any reservation to book a tour with Balasz - you will be guaranteed to experience bountifull joy, laughter and having lots of fun whilst taking in the magnificent sights that Budapest has to offer.We are already planning our return trip next year. Our trip to Budapest and the surrounding countryside, and especially meeting Balasz, was a life enriching experience."

The \"Hidden Treasures of Budapest\" walking tour guided by Andras more than met our expectations and was one of the best tours we have ever been on! Andras is charming, well spoken, agreeable, patient, and very passionate and knowledgeable about Hungary and its culture. In 4+ well-paced hours he showed us Karolyi Garden and Palace, said to be the prettiest small park in the city; the lovely baroque University Church ; two beautiful historic cafes (Central, and Alexandra Book Store); the infamous Ghetto wall from the Nazi era; a fabulous panoramic view of all of Budapest from a private roof top; the amusing Szimba Kert ruin pub; and Freedom Square with its architecturally interesting Stock Exchange and Hungarian National Bank buildings, and Soviet Monument ( with a life-sized statue of Ronald Regan pointedly added recently, nearby!) As a finale, Andras invited us to his parents house outside of the city where his delightful mother and father treated us to a full gourmet dinner! Clearly, the \"Hidden Treasures\" tour was a highlight of our Budapest visit and we enthusiastically recommend it."

My sister can post her own review, but I don't think I'd be out of line by saying that our day with Andras, the owner of My Personal Budapest, may have been the highlight of the entire trip.We spent the entire day with Andras. In the morning, Andras met us and we went on a highlight tour of the city in a Trabant driven by another guide's father (Balazs' father). We were able to get a good overview of the city, and it helped us plan our remaining time in Budapest by getting the truth about what attractions were worth our time and money. We were able to take items out of our later days' itinerary because we covered it in the first tour. Andras also answered every question we had about life in Budapest (the education, healthcare and political systems). The Trabant was eye-catching - it was fun to see other tourists take pictures of the little car. And we were able to see the engine and learn about how it ran, which was fun for me as a novice car enthusiast.Highlights of the morning tour were the Great Market Hall, in which Andras recommended certain sausages and baked goods, the view from the Citidel, a quick look at the Gellart Baths and Opera House, and a coffee break at the Alexandra Book Cafe (you must visit this! We went back again for the excellent coffee, food and the ambiance in the room!).Then we went to Andras' parents house for lunch. What a lovely meal! His parents are wonderful hosts and very kind and considerate. My sister was hit very hard by allergies on the day of the tour. She was miserable and a little embarrassed by her coughing and streaming eyes. Andras' parents couldn't have been more kind - they made her take calcium right there at the table, and sent her home with more calcium and other recommendations to help her survive the allergy/asthma attack. Our meal started with a liquor. Then we had juice and appetizers. We sat down to a meal of vegetable soup with fresh veggies. We then had beef in a game sauce over pasta. This was served with a bottle of white wine from Hungary. This wonderful meal was followed up with cake for dessert. This was our favorite cake by far in Hungary - we tried the other two cakes Andras recommended later in our trip, but the cake served by his mother was our favorite. I had coffee, and all the water we could drink. We talked about our itinerary, with Andras translating. It was just a really special part of our trip, and probably our best meal in Hungary!The afternoon was spent doing the Hidden Treasures Tour, which was wonderful. Andras took into account what we had seen on our first day, and was able to add in a stop to a wine store to recommend certain wines and liquors, and we did go back and used his advice for both the wine store and foods we had to try. We saw a ruin pub, and an art deco cafe (buy a dessert to go - we were so full from lunch that we didn't and we regretted not taking some cake home for later). We saw the last remaining bit of the old Jewish Ghetto wall. Andras showed us how to use the tram, which we used for the remaining part of our visit. I can't even describe properly what a great day we had, or capture the experience in words. It was a wonderful day, and if we had more time in the city, I would have scheduled another tour, such as the music tour and wine tour. Andras is currently developing a new tour, regarding the Hungarian Soul, which we would do when we return to Budapest. Although prices are quoted in Euros, it's done simply as a reference point for tourists. Payment can be made in Forints. For reference, my sister and I are age 44 and 46 respectively. I'm a severe introvert and do not typically seek out such a highly personal tour as meeting strangers is not in my comfort zone. But this was an amazing experience and I cannot stress how glad I was to have done it. And I think the price is more than fair for the experience, and think it's actually low in price for what you get. This was an all day tour, after all, complete with the best meal you'll get in Budapest! Andras' love for his city and his willingness to talk openly about all aspects of life in Hungary, and his personal connection with his guests makes this a must-do for anyone visiting Budapest. DO NOT PASS UP THIS OPPORTUNITY! You won't regret it!"

We talked about everything - from studying in Budapest, to dating (We learnt that Trabants are chick magnets) and his father was very humorous and accommodating as well.Although the cars are vintage, they are extremely well maintained and restored by Balazs and at no time did we feel unsafe or uncomfortable in the car.Thank you to Balazs, dad and three cars for hosting us so well.

Our tour guide Andras was a Budapest-born local who knew the city inside and out. The hidden treasures tour not only showed us a ton of \"off the beaten path\" locales but also contained a lot of very interesting history. The highlights of the walking portion were definitely the last surviving piece of the Jewish ghettos (in a gated community!), a ruin pub, and going to the historic coffee houses. The second part of a tour was a lunch at a Hungarian family's house. Here we had a wonderful lunch prepared by our hosts complete with wine and dessert! It was excellent and gave you a great taste of Hungarian home-cooking.We also went on the Danube bend tour with Andras. We visited three towns along the river where we could sample local cuisine and arts, walk through historic streets and churches, and pop into Slovakia for a picture! This day-tour was a lot of fun and had us in the scenic countryside of Hungary. The tour started with visiting a local ceramicist where she gave a demonstration and allowed us to work the wheel to make a bowl if we wished. It was really cool because it was a manual machine rather than an electric one. We also saw the largest church in Hungary and learned a lot about the history of the countryside as well. Each town has a unique history and it was great to learn about how the people lived in that region. The views of the Danube were breathtaking as well. We also were able to visit some mini-museums in the last town.We really recommend each of these tours to anyone visiting the country. It's a great opportunity to see and learn about Hungary from a local!"

Our guide was Balasz (not Gulash), a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable youg man with an extensive knowledge of the city and even more of Trabants and (communist) oldtimers. Balasz tailored the trip so we didn't revisit the places we'd seen on foot the previous day. Being driven around in a Trabant the size of a big cookie tin through the bustle of Budapest was a real hoot. Balasz is an excellent driver (visit his Facebook page and be surprised...!) and he knows the little cars inside out, we never felt unsafe. He gave us some interesting and good stories at various sites. We then had lunch at his parent's place - they are both very friendly people and his mother had cooked up a nice and traditional meal. For the afternoon, we switched cars to a very pretty Opel Rekord from the 50ies (I think), restored by Balasz himself and even more of an eyecatcher. It was a beautiful sunny day and we enjoyed every minute, visiting a few places off the beaten path. Balasz then dropped us off at a place of our choice. We heartily recommend the trip for Balasz' knowledge of the city, and if you are even a little interested in old cars, you'll come out of the trip as a Trabant-expert."

Balazs is an engaging young man with a wonderful knowledge of Budapest, its history and the most interesting places to see and go. The highlight was driving in his 1966 Trabant, an East German era car which drew smiles and waves everywhere we went and it's much more comfortable than it first appears. This was a great way to get an introduction to both the Buda and Pest sides of the river in a short amount of time. Highly recommended!"

            "review": "Very Personal Tour with Wonderful Guides. I took a family trip with my parents, husband and two adult siblings in late April 2015. Based on good Tripadvisor reviews, I decided to book the Trabant (3 hours) and Danube Bend (8+ hours) tours with My Personal Budapest. The tour company was very accommodating, explaining that our group would have to be split into two cars (the vintage cars in which we would be travelling understandably cannot hold many people) and that a radio connecting both cars would ensure that everyone would be able to hear the guide. In most cases, you would be picked up at your door but because we stayed in such a central area with a busy, narrow road and no parking in front of the building, our guide, Bal\u00e1zs parked very close to where we stayed and we walked about 2-3 minutes to the waiting cars. This wasn't a problem at all, as it was ridiculously close, the weather was glorious and the walk took us by St Stephen's Basilica, which was just behind our accommodation.Bal\u00e1zs acted as our guide on both tours and his sheer enthusiasm and attentiveness was commendable. Bal\u00e1zs knowledge of the history and streets of Budapest (and the surrounding countryside) was impressive and he took pains to accommodate our little group's disparate interests and personalities. Whilst my siblings and I are easily accommodated, my mum has a bad hip and cannot walk far; my dad is abrupt and accentric, with a tendency to wander off on his own; and my husband has a short attention span. Bal\u00e1zs periodically checked to see if my mum was okay when we were walking around and kept tabs on everyone to ensure that no one got lost (people wandering off on their own, lagging behind to window shop or visiting restrooms). The tours were mainly memorable because we had a more personal, tailored introduction to the historic city. Bal\u00e1zs shared some local anecdotes and jokes, told us how locals live, explained Hungarian politics, showed us the neighbourhoods surrounding Budapest and gave us a thorough yet concise run-down of Hungarian/Budapest's history. We also travelled around in beautifully restored and maintained vintage cars - a Trabant and Opel. These drew admiration from many pedestrians and drivers alike and added a different dimension to our experience. It was also clear that Bal\u00e1zs was married to his cars! :)Although we were mainly driven around during the tours, we also had stops at scenic spots and places of interest, allowing us to take photos and have a closer look at various monuments/buildings/areas. It was perfect for mum especially.Bal\u00e1zs' dad acted as the second driver and also chipped in with little snippets of information about Budapest etc from time to time. He was a real gem, making hilarious statements and observations as we went along. Case in point - when we pointed out the Liberty Statue and asked about it, he noted that it was the \"world's biggest bottle opener\". So, not a fan of it, then. He was also a real old-school gentleman, as he made a point of helping all the ladies in and out of the cars and holding the door open for us (my husband would get out of the car and skip off like a lamb in spring, happily oblivious to anyone struggling with bags and heels behind him).Specific comments on the two different tours are as follows:1) Trabant Tour- At 3 hours, it's gives a brief overview of all the main sights and is perfect as a quick way to see the city, if you only have a couple of days. - I felt that it was a little too short to cover much in a fairly spread-out city with so many sights, like Budapest. As we had 5 days, I would've booked a longer city overview tour if it were an available option. I understand from Bal\u00e1zs that the company is considering the provision of a full day tour of the city, which I feel would be a better option.- Please note that you will not be entering the museums and cathedrals on this tour, so plan to do this on a different day, after you get the lay of the land from this tour. When we visited St Stephen's Basilica, we paid 200 Forints each to enter the church. We tried to see the mummified hand of King Stephen but it was housed in such a dark corner and the hand is so small that we couldn't see anything. You'll have to pay another 200 Forints to light up the reliquary for 2 minutes. Although this isn't much, we disagreed with the principle of it and just waited 1 minute for someone else to pay the fee (at which point, the group of tourists hanging around the reliquary started furiously snapping away on their cameras - no flash photography, of course).2) Danube Bend Tour- Simply amazing views. Highly recommended. Very relaxed trip for people who want to see very charming little towns with interesting architecture and the beautiful outdoors.- We got to visit Slovakia (very briefly) on this tour and to take some amazing photos. We also visited the largest cathedral in Hungary (Esztergom Basilica) - another breath-taking building; we were spoiled for choice!- There were sufficient water and restroom stops on both tours, so we never felt uncomfortable for a minute.- Lunch is not included on this tour but Bal\u00e1zs suggested that we could all have lunch together at a little cafe in Szentendre (a must-see), to try langos, a popular Hungarian fast food. It's a fluffy, deep-fried bread with optional toppings of sour cream and/or cheese and garlic spread. Langos is surprisingly light and not too greasy, my entire family enjoyed it. It was simply delicious, cheap and very filling!**Note: Although prices are quoted in Euros, this is just done as an easier reference point for tourists. Payment should be made in Forints.**Note: The vintage cars are a fantastic way to travel but you should know that they are 2-door and small, so it may not be as easy for senior citizens or bigger-sized people to get/fit into them. My family and I are small South-East Asians and my husband is 6 ft 2 inch, of a regular build. My husband was comfortable, sitting in the front passenger seat while my dad and I sat behind. There was just enough space for us, with our various bags and professional cameras. The experience of riding in these cars is incomparable though!Overall, I would recommend My Personal Budapest and Bal\u00e1zs (and his dad!) in a heartbeat. We got to know Bal\u00e1zs and his dad personally, while enjoying the sights and sounds of Budapest and the countryside. For us, it was the personal touch and human connection that made this entire trip memorable. We will definitely call on My Personal Budapest for future guided tours in Budapest."

Therefore a big part of the scheduled tour was already seen by us. Andras was quick to do a little revision of our tour and provided an excellent and interesting tour. I believe he included some the hidden treasures tour in our tour which was an added plus. His knowledge and love for Budapest is definitely reflected by his tour. You definitely get one of the city's best tour guides. We were really happy and enjoyed the tour immensely. The car, Trabant, it was fun and kind of exciting looking at all the people snapping pictures etc. but just be prepared for a very cramped ride. I enjoyed riding in the car and all of the gawkers were fun to watch but cramped. So just be prepared for this. Some have said it to be comfortable, I would not say that just fun and exciting. Budapest is a lovely city and Andras shared his knowledge. Fun day."

We could not have had a better or more rewarding time. Bal\u00e1zs is an engaging young man with an encyclopedic knowledge of Budapest and Hungary. His family is friendly and gracious, and his mother is an excellent cook. If you are looking for a traditional private tour in a luxury sedan or van, then the Trabant tour is not for you. If you want to learn about Budapest and have a lot of fun doing so, then the Trabant tour is just the thing. Our tour with Bal\u00e1zs was both very informative and very entertaining."

            "review": "Three great experiences.. Recently we had the pleasure of enjoying three tours with My Personal Budapest. Trabant tour: Our guide, Bal\u00e1zs, met us our first morning in Budapest in his Trabant for the Trabant tour. After getting an overview of the Trabant we headed out for a tour of the city including the Buda and Pest side. This was a great tour that allows you to get an idea how the city is laid out and what areas you may want to revisit. You also have several photo opportunities of the major sights. One of the best parts is observing the smiles on people's faces when they see the Trabant. Bal\u00e1zs is an energetic guide that provided us with a brief history of Budapest, a very helpful lesson on the Hungarian language, and other interesting facts throughout our journey. He also provided us with helpful restaurant recommendations at the conclusion of our tour. By the end of the tour we concur with his statement that you start off as guide and guest and end as friends.Szentendre and Hungarian lunch:On another day Atilla picked us up at our hotel for a tour to Szentendre and then to Andr\u00e1s\u2019 parents for a Hungarian lunch. Szentendre is a quaint town where we visited the marzipan museum, learned to make pottery which was a nice change of pace for us, and a unique artist\u2019s gallery featuring the smallest pieces of art we\u2019ve ever seen (Atilla was very excited to show us this gallery). We also had time to pop into a few stores to shop. Atilla graciously translated for us as we talked and chatted with shop owners.We then continued to Gizi and George's house (Andr\u00e1s\u2019 parents) where we were warmly greeted. Gizi fixed a delicious lunch for us, which we enjoyed over great conversation of food, family, pictures and travels. Throughout our lunch we felt like we had known them forever. I truly recommend joining them in their home if possible.Overall we were pleased with My Personal Budapest and recommend them. The set tours are a great way to get started. They are adaptable to requests and likes also. For instance, Bal\u00e1zs asked if we liked coffee to which the answer was yes, so he took us to one of his favorite coffee shops, since the Grand Market was closed that day. Communication was reliable with Andr\u00e1s while planning our tours. He was helpful in assisting with our requests."

The day began with a Trabant Tour of the the historical and cultural sites in Buda and Pest. We then had an amazing home cooked meal at Balazs' home in the countryside with Balazs' mother and father. And, we finished the day with the Hidden Gems tour. This tour was the highlight of our wonderful trip to Germany, Austria and Hungary. Balazs is an energetic and engaging young man, and his knowledge of Hungarian history and culture are absolutely amazing. His morning Trabant tour was the perfect introduction to the city, and his hidden gems tour in the afternoon was marvelous. We wandered through the back alleys of Pest, seeing some amazing sites, including the remnants of the wall the Nazis built to create the jewish ghetto and an introduction to the Hungarian Parliament. We paused for coffee and pastries at a quaint little coffee house off the beaten path. By the end of the day, we felt like Balazs was a member of the family. I would be remiss, however, if I did not say that the highlight of the day was the amazing meal his mother and father prepared for us in their lovely home. Mrs. Ackermann's hungarian cooking was as good as my grandmother's, and Mr. and Mrs. Ackermann made us feel so very welcome and comfortable in their home. I am so pleased we had a chance to meet and spend time with them. For those who may be apprehensive about visiting the Ackermanns in their home, throw off your inhibition. You will not regret it. I can't say enough positive things about this tour."

On our way there he told us about a lot of Hungarian history and once there he introduced us to our very lovely hosts at the winery. We enjoyed the day and our time with Attila. The next day we went with Balazs and his dad in their Trabants. Which are really fun retro cars. Besides the cars being fun we went on a 3 hr tour of the city. Balazs was so informative. We stopped at a number of places so that we could take pictures and enjoy the scenery. It was a really great way to learn about the city. Highly recommend this tour company on a trip to Budapest!"

Bal\u00e1zs gave us a warm welcome and explained all about his love for Trabant cars and Budapest before we set off in to the city. The car is great fun, and gets lots of admiring looks and smiles from people in the streets. It's pretty small, although I am 6' 2\" and I managed to last our 3 hour tour without too much discomfort.Bal\u00e1zs was full of interesting information and facts. He also gave us an insight into young peoples thoughts and views in this metropolitan area of Hungary.He took us high up on the Buda side to watch the sun go down and see all the lights come on either side of the Danube and along the bridges. His tours are very flexible, just let him know what you would like to do and he will arrange it for you. Highly recommended, we enjoyed every minute.

Having never been to Hungary before the ensueing commentary about it's history was interesting and welcoming. Following the car tour we carried on to his parents home for lunch. This was a touch of genuine Hungarian hospitality which included home cooked Hungarian fayre and very enjoyable company, thank you.The afternoon took in a walking tour of Pest visiting places we would have just walked past! Like the Ruin Bar ( we visited this again the next day!), again with a full commentary of the area and its history. The walk to the Jewish Quarter was very humbling and to hear the full of history of what happened was very thought inspiring. This tour gave us a brief insight into Budapest and enabled us to use the remaining time we had there to explore places recommended to us by Andras.A well planned and organised tour which we recommend.Thank you Andras!"

My two adult sons and I were visiting for three days, and I wanted a guide who would both take us to the city's \"hidden treasures\" -- the smaller places that aren't on the standard tourism maps -- and point out places and activities that would be fun for two recent college graduates on vacation. Andras gave us exactly what we wanted. Budapest has a slew of amazing cafes, and he took us to a great sampling -- the retro '60s, hipster TaskaRadio; the historic Central, and the magnificent cafe atop a bookstore that feels like a cathedral. We got a great look at some of the city's most distinctive buildings, including an exclusive rooftop view from the President Hotel; walked through the Jewish quarter; at lunch at the Central Market Hall, and visited the city's first and possibly best \"ruin bar\" -- the edgy, grafitti-covered Szimpla. We went back to Szimpla at night -- unforgettable.Andras gave us great pointers to the must-see tourist sites, Castle Hill, the Citadella, and gave us a rundown on the city's main swimming/bathing spas. He gave us great insight about culture, history and politics, and what it's really like to like in Budapest today. The tour was great fun in itself, but Andras also made it easy for us to get the most out of our other two days in Budapest. As a result, we had a wonderful time the entire trip. You can only scratch the surface in three days If we go back, I will most certainly take one of Andras' other tours."

They not only took us to interesting places (like the castle in Visegr\u00e1d), but they gave us the opportunity to ask lots of questions about Hungarians, their history, and their unusual language. Attila did lots of translating for me because he knew I was trying to pick up some new words, and he joked around with my son and kept the tour from being dull. It was a relief to not have to figure out where to go, first of all, and then how to get there. We'd been in Budapest last year and had already visited several of the typical tourist destinations.

I thought the price of the tour was very fair. All correspondences with Andr\u00e1s before and after we clear, quick and personable.

I'm a big guy, 6'4\" and even though it was a challenge getting in and out of the tiny cars once I was in I was comfortable.Bal\u00e1zs was an awesome guide and a fun guy who loves his city and took us to the spots we needed to see and then he dropped the real knowledge on us.The dude is a stunt driver who is well known for his ability to drive those Trabants around on 2 wheels, the videos are crazy, his stories are entertaining.Don't hesitate to take this tour, you have the opportunity to enjoy a great city quickly but make sure your guide keeps all 4 tires on the ground while you are in the car."

His knowledge of the city was top notch and having lunch and drinks with his parents was definitely the highlight of the day. His mother cooked one of the best lunches I've ever had, that soup she made.... Wow!! Over all this is a great way to see such a beautiful city, learn about Hungary, and get to know a great Hungarian family. This was my first private tour and from here on out I'll never do a group tour again! Thank you again Bal\u00e1zs and My Personal Budapest!!"

We spent a total of 11 days in Budapest and having the time with these tours made our trip rich in experiences that we will not forget. I appreciate how knowledgeable these guys were! Both my kids came away with great memories and both want to come back to Budapest.

Exceptional, Andras and Balazs are exceptionally good guides,- the Trabants, the places we went to, conversations about history and cultures, good choices for places to eat .... it was all top quality. Bal\u00e1zs and his father drove us to a variety of sites in the Trabants. Traveling around in the Trabants was remarkable. The cars are beautifully maintained and quite comfortable, though small which is part of the historical experience. However, driving in the small, two cylinder cars gave me an appreciation for the life in Hungary during the years of Soviet control, as contrasted to my life in the US during the same period of time. The Trabant tour, part of which was going to the park of Soviet statues and monuments, was a lifetime memory. Bal\u00e1zs and his father were so friendly, very polite, and the conversations spanned a thousands years from the begining of Hungarian history to the present. We loved the Trabants and Balazs. I would recommend this as a great part of our trip. We also toured Budapest on foot with Andr\u00e1s. Budapest is a beautiful city, and Andras took us to unique sites, historical coffee shops, and unique cultural experiences which we would never have experienced without him as our guide. That was all on foot. Then, we took a day with Andras and toured out into the country side to eat great traditional Hungarian food, take back street tours of little towns, see historical sites, and share time with artist friends of Andras, and again have a day full of great, friendly, conversations about history, culture, and just laughter and good times.  I am so thankful to have Andras, and Balazs as our guides. I will remember them and their parents kindness for decades."

Unless you have a car, public transport touring is slow and whilst the metro is easy, it doesn't go everywhere. Andr\u00e1s was our guide and it was his parents who hosted us lunch. We took a half day car tour followed by Hungarian lunch, then a \"hidden treasures\" half-day tour the following day. His knowledge reflects his love for this city and wandering with Andr\u00e1s around back streets, caf\u00e9 haunts, Turkish baths and quiet gardens added to our experience of how local Hungarians relax. Of course the car tour allowed us to see sentinel attractions, including the castle and the markets. Some were seen driving past, others we walked past, and major sights, we toured through. Other museums (e.g. National Gallery, Hospital in the Rock and House of Terror), Andr\u00e1s encouraged us to go by ourselves due to time constraints, which we did later. It was an excellent way to experience Budapest in 2 days and we enjoyed the hospitality of his family at the lunch. His mother cooks traditional dishes very well and whilst Andr\u00e1s' English is excellent, we enjoyed conversing with his folks who were surprisingly interested in live outside Hungary and were happy to share their insights into life in Hungary in the past and today. Unlike bus tours, or hop-on-hop-off touring, this private tour offers insight and a personal experience. Highly recommended."

On our European 16 day multi-country journey we had only one whirlwind day to spend in Budapest, so we contacted Andras to show us his city. My only regret is that we didn't spend two or three days touring with him. He showed us ALL the major sights of Budapest, gave us a great history lesson and explained the culture of his people while driving us around the city in his car. I don't know how he fit so much into such a short period of time. He picked us up from the train station at 10:00 a.m. and dropped us off directly at our train station at around 5:00 p.m. I can't believe we were able to see so much and do so much in only 7 hours! He is fluent in English so language was no problem at all. If you are ever in Budapest, the absolute BEST thing you could do is retain the services of Andras as your personal guide to explore this wonderful city. It was definitely the highlight of our entire trip. If I ever return to Budapest (and I surely hope I do) I will be sending Andras an e-mail to arrange for his wonderful guidance."

We had such a difficult time choosing between the tours Andras described on his website so we picked 4 of them to fill our 2 full days in Buda and Pest. First, we did the driving tour of the city sights in the Trabant car. That was an amazing way to see the cities and feel like you were part of its history. Next, we did a walking tour of the hidden gems and saw parts of the city that most visitors to the city couldn't find on their own. Absolutely, lovely. The next day, we visited two potters' workshop in a nearby city called Szentendere, where we had the opportunity to use the potters wheel and make a bowl! Way cool! Due to rain, we adjusted our plans and did some fabulous shopping in Szentendere where Andras was able to direct us to the best merchants for what we were looking for. A trip to the miniature museum was also a great find where we saw the smallest bottle of coke and other objects of art that can only be seen through a microscope. Andras was professional, informative, sensitive, and very personable and we thoroughly enjoyed these 3 tours with him. The last tour was so special and made us feel as if we truly felt like a native there. Andras' parents, who are warm, charming people, welcomed us into their home and shared a traditional, delicious home-made meal with us. That really made our trip complete. We highly recommend you have Andras show you his cities for a truly unforgettable experience."

Andras and his parents were helpful in showing me on a map the town where my ancestors came from, Nyiregyhaza. What a thrill to see my maiden name in print. I highly recommend My Personal Budapest Tours. It was a day I will always remember."

They turned up promptly at 9am as they said they would and although the Tribants were a little cosy they certainly drew a lot of attention and were a fantastic way to see Budapest. As there were 6 of us we had two cars and a walkie talkie was set up between the two cars so we could hear the commentary from the front car. Nothing was too much trouble and they completely catered for us all - he was still asking us at 7pm if there was anywhere else we wanted to go! Definitely good value for money. Borash was very knowledgeable and his enthusiasm and passion for his home country was infectious. We had a fabulous lunch and they even got us a bottle of champagne as they knew we were there celebrating a birthday. Nothing was too much trouble and we all agreed that it was the best day of the trip. Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to see the sights of Budapest without having to endure huge tour groups and want to do something a bit different"

My friend and I spent 3 brief days in Budapest during a recent visit to Europe and Attila, Biloj and Andras were instrumental in making it our time in their city one of our highlights. We spent half a day riding around in a Trabant catching the major sites along with having an animated discussion about cars, Communism and daily life in this beautiful city. The afternoon was spent in Etyek having a leisurely lunch and touring a family-owned wine seller and enjoying a small wine-tasting. Overall, it introduced us to the diversity of wine regions and wine-tasting in Hungary as well as a brief slice of history. I wholeheartedly recommend this company during your next trip to Budapest."

We asked for the Hidden Treasures tour which for us included three different districts of Budapest all done by using the Metro, the street cars and trams! He handled all of the tickets/admissions for us so we didn't have to do anything. It was great to see things off the beaten path.We especially liked the view from the top of the President's Hotel!

We got some fantastic pictures and tour guide information helped bring the history to life providing a greater appreciation of the sites visited.

But to us, he will always be known as Bal\u00e1zs. The man who taught himself to ride on two wheels on a Trabant. Yes, he\u2019s a self taught stunt driver folks. Then it was off to the hungarian family lunch which tasted fantastic and was matched by the hospitality. I had two portions of everything and couldn\u2019t get the seat belt to fit when I returned to the Trabant, lol. Secret tours was last and held in store a couple of wee hidden gems.

For several months we had been in ongoing email contact with Andras and had booked two tours back to back -- the walking tour and the lunch in a private home (his parents' home). So we were a little concerned when he wrote that a family wedding would take him away from the city when we were there -- and also mean no lunch at his parents' home since they too were attending the wedding. Of course, we understood completely that family comes first. In any case, there was no need to worry. His colleague Attila took over our walking tour and he was an outstanding guide -- low-key but very knowledgable and with a good sense of humor. We loved going to places that we never would have found on our own, or even with the average tour guide. Several were open only to this tour operation; e.g., a rooftop with spectacular views and a private palace owned and lived in for centuries by the family of Hungary's first president.I had been to Budapest several times before but this was the first visit for the other three family members in our group. For all four of us, it was a very special experience. We highly recommend this tour group for a unique look at a remarkable city -- whether you are a first-time visitor or here after repeated stays.After the tour, we treated Atilla to lunch at Diszno (Pig Bistro), a restaurant recommended to him by Andras, and it was excellent (see separate review).

We chose the three-hour city tour of Budapest, followed by lunch at Andras' charming parents' house, and ended with an out-of-town winery tour. It was clear we should have planned to stay a few days more in Budapest. It is a charming city and Andras' love of his home city made us appreciate it all the more. Knowledgeable about Budapest and Hungary, Andras' presentation was entertaining and kept us chuckling at his sense of humor. We saw so much more than we would have ever found on our own. The Hungarian lunch Andras' mother fixed was delicious! She identified it as stuffed cabbage but I would have characterized it as a soup with shredded cabbage, wonderfully seasoned broth, and lamb-pork meatballs that melted in your mouth. The strawberry-whipped cream-cake for dessert finished off a terrific authentic Hungarian meal, making us feel more like company than tourists.The family winery we toured was about an hour-and-a-half drive out of Budapest. As the miles of rolled by, we were delighted by the countryside. Valerie, the wine-maker, told the story of how the family bought the land and began their winery after the Communists left. After educating us on what it takes to make a good wine, she gave us samples of five different wines to taste. We sat on the winery patio, sipping excellent wine, eating locally-made cheeses and other treats, while gazing at the rolling hills of grape-vines. As enchanting as Italian vineyards or Sonoma in the U.S., this is a place not to be missed.When we think of Budapest, it is this wonderful day that comes to mind. Do yourself a favor and book Andras' (or his colleagues) for a unique experience you can't get anywhere else!"

For the lunch, Andras's mother cooked a big meal and served it to us in her home. The food was really good and she made extra for me since I'm a vegetarian. It was much more interesting to be a guest in a real family's home than to go to a typical restaurant. The Danube Bend tour was also great - we visited an old castle which you could walk through and see amazing views of the Danube. We liked the other parts of the tour too but these were our favorites. I would recommend My Personal Budapest to anyone visiting the area."

We requested a combo of hidden treasures and culinary delight which lasted about 6 hours. Our guide Bal\u00e1zs was great to point out the historic places and also give us a real feeling for the present times. From a secret rooftop helipad view, to a coffee at an Art Nouveau bar, we really got a feel for the city which could not have been possible on our own. And the food was delightful! Really reccomend to use them on your visit to Budapest, you will not be disappointed! It was really nice to have one price for the tour/travel passes/food."

Balazs was our guide, and he knew a lot about the history of the city. Nine hours is a long time to spend with a complete stranger, but he made the time go by really quick. We saw a lot, and he adjusted some stops to accommodate our needs. We saw so much, that we see no need to do our other planned tours. The lunch at his parents house was wonderful. The appetizers and meal was good.... But the Apple Struedel for dessert was absolutely wonderful.... It could be served in any 5 star restaurant. Balazs and his family were very welcoming, and very enjoyable to be with.... Book this tour... You will not be disappointed"

The tour featured a number of places we never would have found on our own, including a rooftop view of a wonderful Art Nouveau ceramic tile roof in a nearby building, a visit to a \"ruins pub\" (where everything is decorated with recycled items), and a look inside one of the palaces in the city. We did most of it on foot, which gave us a chance to see lots of side streets and learn unexpected facts about the city."

We lucked out big time with Andras from My Personal Budapest. On day one we did a tour in [2] old Trabants that were in mint condition. The drivers were a father and son duo that made us feel right at home. Touring Budapest in these unique classic cars made the tour that much more exciting. Andras was well versed in Hungarian history and did an excellent job of keeping the tour on a level that was interesting not only for my wife and I, but also for my 23 year old son and 21 year old daughter. One stop on the tour was to the Marketplace where we tasted some excellent Palinka and strudel. Day two we did a walking tour to see some off the beaten path spots that you would not find on your own. For lunch, Andras took us to a friends home for a home cooked Hungarian meal. Upon entering his friend's apartment, we were immediately made to feel like family. I can not stop raving about the delicious meal that we ate. My kids are picky eaters and they both loved it. At lunch, our host had offered us home made Palinka that was out of this world.What more can I say, Andras is the real deal and will and will make you feel right at home in Budapest!"

Booked a few months before our visit with Andras and had expected to have 2 trabants as some need a driver and guide and there were 3 of us and no way would 5 of you fit in a Trabant! When we were met at our hotel bang on 9 oclock I was delighted to find we had only the one, and what a fab little car it was. Balasz (pronounced bollarge), a 24 year old expert in these cars who has rebuilt several of these old vehicles proudly showed us the one he was driving that day, talked about how it works and showed us the engine and explained how he had done it up. He was so enthusiastic and engaging, lovely start to our day. We had booked 2 tours, the general tour of Budapest for the morning and the hidden gems. After a busy day I dont think we left anything out - he took us everywhere - spas, old buildings, ruin pubs, fantastic lunch cafe with good local food, castle area, parliament area, Jewish area, all the bridges. The whole time telling us about these places and their history. Highlight for me though was to go onto the roof of an hotel and see the view of the city from their helipad. You would not find that on most tours! Such a unique way to see the city, I would thoroughly recommend this to anyone. High praise for Balasz, his great little car and his unending energy and enthusiasm."

Andras replied via email within 2 hours and we were able to set up a day long tour of Budapest. Balasz arrived at our hotel right on schedule in his expertly maintained Trabant. We set off on a morning tour to see the highlights of Buda and Pest. Balasz is an amazing tour guide with a fun and witty sense of humor and expert knowledge about his beautiful city/country. His English language skills are impeccable! He shared a tremendous amount of information during our tour and even took us for coffee at one of his favorite cafes. We had booked the winery tour for the afternoon. The vineyard was about 30 minutes outside the city and traveling through the beautiful Hungarian countryside in the Trabant was definitely a real treat! We were greeted at the winery by the owners and made to feel right at home as we sampled wines from the vineyard and a enjoyed a wonderful spread of tapas prepared for us. It was a wonderful way to be introduced to the beautiful city of Budapest and I highly recommend My Personal Budapest Tours!"

In April 2014 I and my companion-both retired educators-had an open day from our river cruise trip and booked a full day with Andras (mypersonalbudapest). If you want to relive your days of riding in a vw bug, the Trubant tour is just the thing. Ackerman is the owner and driver and a very engaging young man. We then had lunch at Andras's parents' home. They are delightful and gracious people and Andras Mom is a terrfic cook. We spent the afternoon on a walking tour with Andras showing us the Hidden Treasures of Budapest. If you want to go off the beaten path, experience the real Budapest and stay off the \"touristy\" sites, Andras is your man. You will find yourself on a helipad atop a hotel;viewing the remains of the ghetto wall from WWII, in coffee houses with Art Deco museums in their basement. He is well informed, organized, loves his Budapest and wants visitors to learn about its history. Without a doubt our day with Andras and Ackerman was the highlight of our two week Viking River Cruise."

We took the Hidden Treasures tour with Balasz, in his Opel, and it truly was amazing. Balasz is a very personable young man, who displays incredible knowledge and love for his country (and cars). He showed us truly amazing gems that we never, never would have found on our own, which made Budapest and her people come alive for us. Hands down favorite for me though was the lunch with Andrasz's parents, who are the loveliest and most gracious hosts. The food was amazing and Balasz was perfect as the translator. We exchanged many stories about our families, children and cultures. We met as strangers but left as friends. Please, please, please give yourself a gift and take this tour as an opportunity to learn more about a country and her people than you will ever learn from a museum. Scott and Liz from Boston."

Forget the pre-packaged bus tours and phone Apps, the personal tour we had with Balazs was extraordinary. It started outside our hotel where the Trabant was parked next to a Maserati and a BMW, yet it was the little Trabant that received all the attention from the passing crowds and with good reason. The car was immaculately maintained and very clean on the inside and riding through the streets of Budapest in this was an experience in itself. Balazs took us to some of the lesser known sights of Budapest and apologized that he couldn't show us anymore because we were scheduled to fly home that same day. If we had known we would have been doing it a day earlier. Our guide's English was excellent and his demeanor was so chirpy it made you feel secure and happy at all times. His access to some of the areas of the city was incredible and we got vistas that were unparalleled. A better photographer would have had a field day. We took as many photos as we could. The knowledge of the city was superb and he was able to answer every question. In conclusion I would wholly recommenced this experience and would love to see this kind of service replicated across other cities."

We are fairly experienced travelers and don't usually take a formal tour, however, we knew very little about Budapest and decided to hire Andr\u00e1s for our first day in the city. We are REALLY glad we did!Everything about the day was perfect! Andr\u00e1s took us on a tour of the hidden sites in Budapest and pointed out many other interesting spots along the way. This allowed us to return to what interested us in the following days. He then took us to lunch at his parents' house. His mother prepared an amazing Hungarian meal and we really enjoyed their warm hospitality. Finally he took us to the Etyak wine region where we toured the Hernyak Winery and sampled their wines which included another amazing plate of local cheeses and cured meats. The quality of the wines were a nice surprise! We are frequent visitors to the Napa & Sonoma regions and enjoy finding and drinking small batch premium quality wines. We did not expect to find such amazing wine in Hungary and now we wish we could find these wines in our part of the world. It seems that Hungary keeps most of it to themselves.We highly recommend starting your first trip to Budapest with a tour from Andr\u00e1s and even if it is not your first time he still has much to offer. If we get the opportunity to return to Budapest we would hire him again and challenge him to provide another unique tour experience."

Extremely knowledgeable about the history of the country and city, he was modest to a fault and taught us the facts in a way that we are still recounting to friends back home. Although we tended to ask a lot of questions and going off at various tangents, not only about the tour but about Hungarian life in general, he kept the talking and walking flowing very well. Three hours passed like three minutes and we would have loved to have spent more time with him, but as we couldn't, he gladly pointed out further areas of interest on our map and recommended some other things to do. One of which is to try to get lost in Budapest, a recommendation we accepted as we stumbled across some wonderful children's craft festival in the castle district and the lovely Olympic park by the Parliament. I would thoroughly recommend this tour company for a genuine, quality and personal experience."

He then took us to a small family owned winery a short car ride outside of Budapest (Hernyak Winery). If you like wine I absolutely recommend this part of the trip, as a wine lover who has traveled to numerous wineries in California, Spain and Argentina I never expected Hungarian wine to be this good. The wine tasting included with a plate of wonderful locally made cheeses and meats. Andras also gave us a number of other great recommendations that kept us busy for the rest of our time in Budapest.

I'm not really one generally for looking inside car engines but I even found that interesting!Balazs told us and showed us how he had 'pimped' AOX to include a unique sun roof, horn and easily lifting front seat to enable minimal effort in getting into the back seat ! The subsequent tour was funny and fascinating! We learnt a great deal and despite our Brummie/Midlands accents, I think Balazs learnt a little from us too! His English was better than a lot of English people I know!! Balazs also tailored the tour for us after we advised him that we wanted to incorporate an element of the 'Hidden Budapest' tour. He took us to a wonderful coffee house which we would never have found otherwise! When we eventually arrived at the Hungarian home for the traditional meal which formed the 2nd part of our booked tours, we had only just over an hour to sample the delights and hospitality here. This was entirely our fault and I think on reflection we should have asked for a an earlier hotel pick up ! We loved the food and the experience however, and the airport drop-off afterwards was an excellent value-for-money extra which was very much appreciated and much more fun than a mini-bus or taxi transfer !!Our thanks go to Balazs, to Andras and to Andras's parents for making the day so memorable!! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend MyPersonalBudapest to others, and I do hope the trip to Budapest wasn't my last, as I'd love to try some of the other tours they offer."

We loved riding around in the Trabant antique car. We highly recommend Andras."

First we met our tour guide Balazs at our hotel and he introduced us to his fabulous Trabant retro style car which we would be travelling in for the first part of the tour! Such a cool funny looking car, felt like we had been transported back in time ! He gave us the lowdown on the history of this car and also that he restores them in his spare time.so nice to see his passion and pride for something that he loves to do and also that he could make a living from it!We went to the five main attractions, he parked up, we walked around took pictures and spoke about the landmarks. After he took us to a beautiful cafe for coffee with antiques adorning the walls and ceiling! That was pretty cool.Would never have found otherwise. Then it was on to our second tour of the day where we met with another tour advisor Attlia, as we were being taken to a charming little arty town north of Budapest called Szentendre! We were thought how to make pottery first, then we walked the cobble lock streets of this gorgeous town admiring the old churches and houses while Attila spoke about its history. He then took us to a marzipan museum! This was the business! Later he took us to an authentic Hungarian restaurant where we ate smokin hot goulash! We barely came up for air..! Another jazzy looking interior. After all that it was time to drive back to Budapest and get ready for our dinner boat cruise on the Danube! A four course meal with live music so relaxing and perfect to finish our busy day. Although we were still full from the goulash so we practically rolled off the boat on our bellies lol Big Thanks to Balazs and Attila for the wonderful day on our private tour! You made our trip :) Love love love Budapest! Hope to return in summer time next!"

The Christmas market in Budapest was in full swing and we loved walking and touring the city landmarks and attractions on our own but we did spend one very enjoyable afternoon with Balazs from \"My Personal Budapest\". It was our favorite time as Balazs took us to many behind the scenes places that tourists do not frequent. Our tour included both walking and public transportation to get from place to place so except for the fact that my husband carried a camera and we kept looking up at the buildings we felt like we were blending into the culture. We started out on a helopad with a 360 view of both Buda and Pest and a view of a gorgeous tile roof that could not be seen from the street. We covered numerous sites including the last remaining portion of the Jewish Ghetto wall from WWII and a unique ruin pub. Balazs was knowledgeable, personable and was a pleasure to have as a tour guide. I highly recommend this tour company and especially this tour for a unique experience to anyone visiting Budapest."

Balazs is also a very personable young man who had our comfort in mind and recommended places to eat and drink. His English is excellent too.

It has the perfect combination of beatiful location, impressive buildings and plenty of attractions and cozy restaurants to enjoy a perfect weekend. But the best choice was to meet Andr\u00e1s, who, during a full day, showed his beloved city with true passion, excellent knowledge and very good sense of humour. We really felt like being guided by a friend . We took the combination of Trabant Tour ( great fun in the smallest car you can imagine), Hidden Treasures ( you could never find the atractions he shows) and Home Lunch ( great food at the home of his lovely parents). It was a wonderful experience, can only reccommend this tour and we will for sure trust Andr\u00e1s in a future visit to Hungary.For Spanish visitors, Andr\u00e1s does not speak Spanish, but his English is perfect and very easy to understand, even if you are not fluent in the language."

Andr\u00e1s picked us up at our hotel, we were five minutes early downstairs, but he was waiting for us. He gave us an overview of our day and then we were off. A lovely breakfast in a spot we never would have found on our own, with fresh coffee, then we were off for many hidden gems, a huge lunch, a river cruise, and the best strudel I've ever had. Throughout the day he suggested other things we could do on our own as well. All of this was included in the low price of the tour. He was FANTASTIC with our boys ages 14 and 11 and involved them throughout the day. When we come back we will definitely book another tour with Andr\u00e1s."

He was a very gracious host. In addition, the people with whom he set up our wine tasting were completely delightful - that afternoon was definitely one of the highlights of our trip.I thought his price was very fair, and while he accepts only cash payment, he can take euro or forint - which made things a little easier for those of us carrying more than one type of currency.I would wholeheartedly recommend him and absolutely would use him again if I'm lucky enough to return to Budapest."

The early fog cleared for us to enjoy coffee on the lakeside and lunch in Tihany. Andras is an exceptionally pleasant guide and was comfortable to answer any questions. For us, this gave us great insight into the past, current and future situations faced by Hungary. We could read a history book about Balaton Fured, but our enduring memory is imagining the happy reunification of German families there who had been tragically torn apart by the communist regime (Hungary was the only country that East Germans could travel to during the cold war). If we are able to travel to Europe again, Hungary would be top of our list to revisit. Thanks Andras!"

Our afternoon was a walking tour of hidden treasures of the city such as a \"ruin bar\", a trip on the Undergroud and some wonderful coffee salons. Andr\u00e1s took us to some excellent restaurants serving delicious local cuisine, and he recommended numerous places to visit on our own the next day. Two days later we met again to take the Danube Bend tour which was so much more! We enjoyed a visit with a lovely ceramics teacher and tried our hand at making a pot.

Unless they have wisely booked MyPersonalBudapest.  I had added and changed some requests prior to my trip, as i wanted to see the Great Synagogue ,which would be closed for a holiday the following day. Attila swung by theJewish quarter and even though I was not able to see the inside of the synagogue, he gave me a glimpse, something my tour did not deliver. We shared lunch at a wonderful art nouveau cafe, explored Alexandra book store's three levels and secrets, and at my request even stopped at a great shoe store whose brand is hard to find in US.  When I return to beautiful Budapest, I will call on MyPersonalBudapest again to efficiently discover more. Thank you so much for the memories!"

Even before we were out of the city limits of Budapest Attila pointed out Roman ruins, slowing down long enough for me to quickly snap a picture. At each stop along our route Attila not only showed us points of interest, but also told us the history of the place. The last stop of day was at a family owned winery. This was icing on the cake! The meat and cheese platter was a perfect end to the tour accompanied by the best white wine I have ever had.

Never having been to the city, and with only two days to spend, we wanted to maximize our time and see/do as much as possible. After reading the reviews for MyPersonalBudapest on TripAdvisor, we decided to book a full day out - the Trabant tour, the home lunch, and the Hidden Treasures tour.Balazs picked us up from our hotel in the Trabant, which was very convenient and great fun! We spent the morning exploring the \"main\" sights of Budapest. We peppered Balazs with a LOT of questions about the history of Budapest, past and present, and were very impressed with how knowledgeable he was! Not only was he knowledgable, but he was also very personable. We really enjoyed hearing about Budapest from a local's perspective, discussing the differences between our cultures, and generally just having a laugh!! It was a gorgeous day out, so Balazs was able to put the top down on his Trabant. This was really fun!We then headed out for the home lunch. The hosts were fabulous, welcoming us into their homes and sharing some DELICIOUS Hungarian food with us. We got to meet others who were on Attila's tour, and had a delicious lunch full of laughs with our tour guides and hosts. We really enjoyed this, and could barely get fit back in the Trabant after lunch because we were so full! We thought that the homemade lunch was a great break between the morning and afternoon tours, and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, the delicious meal, and the great company. In the afternoon, we continued on with the Hidden Treasures tour. We went to a variety of sights, relaxed with a coffee in a really neat coffee shop with Communist-era decor, took in some great views, and had a really nice afternoon. Overall, Balazs was a fantastic tour guide. We felt that the tour was well worth the money spent, and commented many times throughout the day how grateful we were not to be on a generic bus tour with 60 other people crowding to hear the guide talk. The personal touches were absolutely fantastic, and we really felt that we came away with a much stronger sense of Budapest, it's people, and it's history.Thanks for a very memorable tour!"

He showed us the \"hidden treasures\" of the city, where typical tour groups may not get to visit. Because of such, it made it that much more memorable. We enjoyed having Attila as our guide. He showed us cafes, museums, bookstore, art gallery, and more. It was raining the morning we had his tour, and we had to miss one stop where one could see the beautiful rooftop of a former bank. To our surprise, as soon as we got back to our hotel, he was already on his way to bring us some refund money because we missed that place. We appreciate his honesty. He also said he had a transit day pass for our family when we first met in the morning. But we already had our pass, and forgot to ask him for his so we could use it the next day."

Andras spoke intelligently with information about Budapest I thought he would not know. I also had a great deal of fun talking with Balazs about his pride and joy, the Trabants, and also about 60s and 70s muscle cars of which he was surprisingly knowledgeable given his young years. I also did the culinary tour and enjoyed Andas' selections of delicious meals and snacks. His hidden treasures tour was also very worthwile, and because of my time limitations we weaved that tour into the others for an entremely enjoyable and informative tour. I highly recommend this tour. DO IT!"

This quirky little car was an attraction itself! Andras showed us the highlights of Buda and Pest, but most impressive was his historical knowledge and deep appreciation of Hungarian culture. I felt as though we not only had a guide, but someone who truly loved his city and heritage. The tour ended with a delightful in-home lunch with Agi, who prepared a lovely traditional meal. The second day, we took the Danube Bend tour with Attila. The visit to the three villages was a perfect counterpart to the tour of Budapest. Atilla was also very well versed in Hungarian history and added so much to each site, castle, ruin and church we visited. I think any of the tours offered by My Personal Budapest would make your visit to Budapest even more special."

However, if you can only do 2 days, I would highly recommend combining these two days as we did for a perfect Budapest experience. Andras, and his trusty driver, Bolesz, in his vintage (and immaculate Trabant), took us all over Budapest to see the major sights the first morning. WIth the open top of the car we were able to enjoy the beautiful buildings all around us. For lunch we had booked his special \"lunch with the locals\" and that couldn't have been better! Excellent food and a nice chance to relax with local Hungarians. (However, if you are a cook, Agnes has her own tour that would take you to the market to shop, then you return to her apartment to cook the food...next time!) We returned to our hotel anticipating the next day's trip to the countryside...what a fantastic day it was! As usual, Andras had booked perfect weather for us. We drove to their large lake, Lake Balaton, which is a beautiful blue with assorted resort villages dotting it all over. However, he took us to what must have been the most beautiful town to sit for a coffee next to a marina, then walked along the shore, saw their famous Cardiac Hospital, and then continued on to the peninsula village of Tihany where I could have spent quite a few hours. We saw the Benedictine Abbey, bits of the village, and then continued on to the Istvandy winery which was the perfect end to the day. Andras had arranged our lunch and wine tasting which was wonderful in every way...we didn't want to go home! Andras was the best, most personable, private guide we have ever used. His knowledge of history, architecture, music, etc. and where to take you to allow you to feel the heartbeat of Hungary is superb. If you can have two days with him, do the city tours (whatever ones you want) but make sure to visit the countryside for a day, too. The two days combined gave us a great appreciation for this country."

I had wanted a food tour, but no need to schedule it, there was so much good food included in the tour that I never expected, that it really was a two day food tour in addition to everything else. We did a two day tour. The first day we saw some important sites in Budapest, including the Szechenyi Baths, Chain Bridge, Buda Castle, Citadel, and more. Later we had lunch in Andras' family home. This is an experience you can't get anywhere else. Not only was his family lovely and gracious, but the food was very enjoyable and plentiful. From there we went to a lovely winery where we were fed again. The winemakers were a husband and wife team, their presentation was personal and informative. I will never forget that experience as well. The second day we saw off-the-beaten-trail sites in Budapest: good views, hidden ceiling paintings, the Ruin bar (another highlight, we had the bar to ourselves and the whole place is full of hidden works of art and other ingenious things), and more. Later we walked around ourselves and realized how close all these things are together, but without a guide it would take a lot more time to see so much. In fact, most of the highly rated things on Trip Advisor seemed to have been on our tour. The day started at a fascinating local market with a beautiful meat and cheese plate but we didn't expect it so we'd already eaten breakfast. My husband had a coffee he described as the best he'd had in his life. We also had lunch at a restaurant Pesti Diszno, which turns out to be a restaurant written about in the New York Times with excellent Trip Advisor reviews, we tried three soups (my husband and I shared two) and three main dishes, all very tasty and typically Hungarian. We then had delicious warm pastries at First Strudel House. All of these snacks, admissions, and transportation were included in our tour, which I didn't expect.My only hesitation for giving five stars is that Andras, who is pictured, was not our guide. He is the A list and I didn't realize we wouldn't have him. We had Attilla, who was thoughtful and attentive, he just lacked the gift of gab that you would expect a tour guide to have. Several times I felt that he didn't seem to have enough information to impart and that it was more a string of facts rather than story telling. Several times I felt the conversation got too involved in our jobs and finances, subjects I found especially uncomfortable because of our respective countries' financial disparities. We did really like Attila, and we certainly learned a lot about Hungarian life from him, I just think there's some room for improvement.I highly recommend using My Personal Budapest, though I think the company's name and promo photo may be misleading. This was an unforgettable tour."

We took this tour during one of the hottest days of the year in Budapest (101F) - and still enjoyed it very much. So, yes, that's how good it is.We combined the main sights + culinary tour since it did not make sense in my opinion to try to squeeze the main sights tour between breakfast and late lunch. I strongly recommend you do that since everything flows better. We had breakfast at a local market and already started talking about Budapest history, recent events, etc. Then we went for the main sights tour. Everything was covered and questions answered without rush, at a very relaxed pace.One small improvement suggestion for larger groups. We were in two Trabants (cars) and used a radio to communicate between stops. But the radios used are not very clear and the group in the second car sometimes would not properly understand the guide's observations. Therefore clearer radios or some other solution would be better for larger groups.All in all highly recommended."

This was entirely above-and-beyond our basic requirements, and showed that he is very willing to go the extra mile for clients. The Trabant was a great attraction, and our driver was a charming man. Despite being rather tall people, we all fitted in easily enough. The personalised piano concert was the highlight for my partner.

The two days that we spent with Attila from MyPersonalBudapest were among the best days of our trip. I began by emailing Andras to create itineraries for two days. Initially, I wanted to tour Budapest on Sunday and do the Danube River Bend Tour on Monday. Andras suggested that we switch our tours around as many places such as the Great Market in Budapest are closed on Sunday and we'd miss out. After several emails, our days were set.On the first day, Attila met us at the apartment which we were renting. He was prompt and arrived in his personal car which was clean and well maintained. At first we thought Attila was a bit reserved and quiet, but we were quite wrong (in a good way!) He spoke perfect English and had a great sense of humor, offering us terrific insights into the way of life of Hungarians. Attila taught us a great deal of history filled with anecdotes along the way. Clearly, he has a great love and pride of his native Hungary.We took off to do the Danube River Bend tour and Attila was kind enough to search for an ATM for us on the way, even standing nearby and watching as we used the machine. Our first stop was Szentendre. We arrived early in the morning, just as everything was opening, with few tourists around. Attila asked what kind of art we enjoyed (as this is an artist's town) and took us to the shops that reflected our interests. We enjoyed the winding, narrow roads and Attila's explanation of why they were built that way. (I'll let him explain that to you.) The shops were lovely and Attila was patient as both my husband and I took a multitude of photos and browsed to see if there were items which we wanted to buy. We went into a beautiful old Serbian Orthodox church and Atttila explained the customs and history, while giving us tips on Hungarian pronunciation! We then went into the Szabo Marzipan Museum, which was quite interesting! (All tickets were included in the price that Andras had set.) From there we went on to the town of Visegrad, where we saw a castle and breathtaking views of the Danube and the river valley. Next, we traveled to Esztergom, where we visited a stunning cathedral. Below the castle was a restaurant where we ate a delicious French lunch (as it was Bastille Day). (Lunch was at our own expense, which had been explained previously.) As it was Sunday, there was a mass in the cathedral and Attila told us that we must hear the organ play, but he was not certain when it would begin. As we walked outside, admiring the view, Attila repeatedly checked inside for us to see when the organ playing would begin. He ushered us in right on time and it was indeed splendid. I'll also add that Attila was quite helpful in showing my husband and I spots to take the best photos from. It was an informative, relaxing day that we just loved, and we would recommend this the Danube Bend tour highly. We almost took a bus tour and are so glad that we did not. Oh, and we even drove into Slovakia to see the view of Hungary from there! Very cool!On the next day, Monday, Attila met us again at 9AM and brought us around the corner to where Balazs had his Trabant parked. What a lovely young man and what a fun car! He actually made the top into a convertible by himself. Balazs gave us a great explanation about the history of the car model and my husband had fun looking at the engine with him and comparing it to the Volkswagen Bugs that he had long ago.The morning was spent with Balazs driving and Attila guiding. The banter between them made the ride even more fun. We saw great sights (you can read about them in the previous reviews - I had read all 180 of them before booking this tour, which Attila found hard to believe, but it was true!) and once again, Attila was a wealth of information and so pleasant to be with. We never felt rushed at all.We went back to Attila's car, said goodbye to Balazs, and then hopped back into Attila's car for a drive to the countryside to have lunch with Andras's parents. They were lovely, welcoming us with Palinka and appetizers, and then serving a delicous lunch of vegetable soup, Lecso (stew) and roasted chicken, followed by raspberry cake.We headed back to Budapest, dropped off the car, and took public transportation to see the Hidden Treasures of Budapest, including a ruin bar which I requested that Attila take us to. I'll add that I had mentioned in my email to Andras that I was a bit concerned about too much walking due to a foot injury, and Attila offered to drive us for the afternoon tour to lessen the walking that we'd have to do. Fortunately, that was not necessary, but Attila's kindness and concern were evident. The Hidden Treasures tour was fun (we were a bit tired by then but we did enjoy it) and we saw places that we never would have found on our own. Andras clearly has good connections, even enabling Attila to get us into a famous mansion on a day that it was formally closed!By the time we were dropped off at our apartment at day's end, we felt like we had made a good friend and were sorry to say goodbye after our two days! I'd highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting the delightful city of Budapest. Best regards to Attila, and I do hope you find what you are looking for. ;)"

I was a little worried at first when I read all of the great reviews of andaras and then found out we would have a different guide because he was busy. Fears were unfounded as BalazsI was exceptional. Great knowledge, inquisitive, fun, caring, warm and friendly. I love taking personal tours because you can have great conversations about the region, culture, history and of course, restaurant and other recommendations. These guys are great. The trabant tour was so fun and the sights memorable."

Only a few moments after meeting Andras in out hotel, we felt comfortable in his company and eager to embark on a custom-designed tour of the Danube bend, complete with a wine-tasting in the afternoon. The people you meet on this tour - including, of course, Andras - are what makes the day so memorable. We will never forget shaping our first clay bowl under the expert guidance and encouragement of Gabrielle. Smiling, vibrant Gabrielle. Every moment spent with Andras - strolling through the cobbled streets of Szetendre, gazing at the flooded Danube from a scenic overlook, or simply driving from place to place - was filled with open, intense, and sometimes even philosophical conversation. In itself, a rarity in these days of superficiality. Yet again, during the wine-tasting, the encounter with Valerie was so genuine. Filled with admiration for what she and her husband had created in less than 20 years following their escape from Serbia, we felt moved by her tale. Another person along our way whom we will always remember. I mustn't omit the mention of the delicious cold plate we were served, the good wines we tasted and the exclusive hilly location of their vineyards. It was a day - and three very special people - to remember!"

Honestly, Andras has given me such a fresh view of Budapest...My husband and I were in Budapest for less than 2 days in May. We had arranged 3 tours together with Andras: Trabant tour in the morning, Hungarian lunch in a Hungarian home, and The hidden treasures of Budapest. The total cost was 220 euros. I initially thought it was a little pricy, but trust me, at the end of the day, I felt it was totally worth it!The tour with personal, had a very nice pace, and was tailored to our interest. The Trabant tour was fun and took us to a lot of places that would have taken too long to get to by foot. I particulary loved the lunch because it was intimate and really gave me a sense of how locals live their lives. Not to mention that the lunch was so yummy because it was made by a lovely professional chef! The afternoon walk tour was relaxing. Andras took us to a lot of local places that tourist would have never discovered. Additionally, we were able to ride the subway and the bus, and take a little break here and there in the market or charming cafteria.What more can I say? If you ever consider a tour in Budapest, this is it! You won't find anything better than this. Perphaps I will go back for another tour with my family some day..."

That\u2019s what Andras Novak specializes in, and he delivers it faster than Domino\u2019s. A true child of the city, Andras took us to the nooks and crannies we would have otherwise missed: the park and palace of the Karolyis, an old aristocratic family \u2026 an art nouveau caf\u00e9 that looks like it walked straight out of a Klimt painting \u2026 the Central Caf\u00e9 coffee shop where the poets and writers and firebrands of a world long vanished frequented, sipping strong coffee and tossing strong opinions \u2026 the Alexandra Bookstore which would be what you\u2019d get if the Taj Mahal gave birth to a Barnes & Noble (where we also had a chance to tour a little-seen part of its art gallery) \u2026 the Jewish quarter \u2026 and Szimpla Kert, a \u201cruin pub,\u201dwhose interior decorator must have been a wrecking ball and a stick of dynamite. There you can drink in a bathtub or an East German Trabant, the car that made a Yugo look like a Rolls Royce. But all of this would have been pictures without meaning if it wasn\u2019t for Andras\u2019 encyclopedic knowledge and his passion for history. Walking with Andras is like being served a pastry in one of the city\u2019s many patisseries\u2013a treat, as full of history as much as flavor."

Andr\u00e1s realized we had quite a few things planned and offered getting us tickets for the river cruise so we wouldn't have to worry about that. He planned a great 3h-tour, which perfectly fit in our schedule so we were able to catch the ship right on time. Coming down to the lobby of our hotel, Bal\u00e1zs - a true Trabant enthusiast - already expected us and first held a quick history lesson about Trabant cars. The tour took us to the most important sights of Budapest with Bal\u00e1zs pointing out a few hidden treasures we would need to check out later during our trip. Throughout the tour we were frequently asked if there was anything else we wanted to see but we laid our full trust into Bal\u00e1zs' experience as a guide and we weren't disappointed. The Trabant-Tour was absolutely fantastic and it was definitely a highlight during our stay in Budapest. On a side note: Bal\u00e1zs is an extraordinary driver and very passionate about his Trabant. You will enjoy listening to him and the stunts he's performing with his car! :)One remark: If you know what sights or special locations you want to visit, you might as well tell them in advance. I am sure they will set up an individual trip for you."

The afternoon ended with a visit to a small winery overlooking the lake. Breathtaking! The food at the winery is outstanding, the best meal we had during our entire trip. The wines were wonderful and the view is unbeatable. Overall a picturesque and relaxing afternoon. If you have the time, definitely add this to your itinerary.

One thing that I have found to be consistent with the tours we have taken (my partner researches these on Tripadvisor , among other sites) is that each guide-the good ones-bring a little of themselves to the picture. They cannot help it-they are in this business because of their own curiosity, their love of history and their city or country and their desire to share that with others. That being said, we have been very lucky to get the guides we have. Andras is polite, deferential, really, really smart and knowledgeable. He is interested in what you want to know, and guides his tours that way, answering questions thoughtfully and thoroughly. He met us at our hotel mid morning and came back with us when the tour was over. Since this was a tour for two people, there was time to stop for something to eat or to go to the bathroom. It's a city tour, so shoes for walking in the city are good to wear.The tour we took is aptly named \"Hidden Treasures.\" Andras grew up in Budapest, in Pest, and so he is familiar with many places known only to locals. We would never have found many of these places on our own, and in fact, had never even heard of some of them. The Karolyi Gardens and Palace, the first stop on the tour, was a perfect example. A beautiful park, part of the former estate of the Karolyi family, it is easily passed by as its entrance is small and unprepossessing. Once through the small gated entry, it's lovely. Andras took us through the estate and the history of the place and the family beautifully.His love for the city, and for these places in particular was evident. The Central Bookstore and Alexandra bookstore are on the tour as well as the statue of Ronald Reagan - right across from the Soviet monument! And there's a wreck of a building turned into a hopping night spot, kosher bakeries and one of the most hidden highlights on the tour was the Post Office!Had we not taken this tour we would have walked past some of the most beautiful and interesting sights in Budapest, never knowing of their existence! It was well worth the morning. We had a wonderful time."

It turned out to be Balazs, our Trabant driver, showing the car to local workers and explaining how it works. My husband was immediately in heaven, as he has quite a love for old cars. Attila, our guide, arrived and we were off for our adventurous Trabant tour. Both Attila and Balazs were very knowledgeable and entertaining and great to spend the morning with. They showed us various sights throughout the city and explained the history and politics behind it all. So many beautiful things to see-Heroes Square, the baths, Parliament, Chain Bridge, Buda, Fisherman's Bastion,Matthias Church,the Liberation Monument, not to mention the magnificent views from the Buda side. As the homemade hungarian lunch was not available on the day of our tour, after the Trabant tour, Balazs dropped us off at Trofea for a buffet lunch which featured many Hungarian specialties. Attila explained the various dishes to us and we were able to sample many foods. After lunch, we began the The Hidden Treasures tour, beginning in the Jewish Ghetto. We walked, rode on streetcars, and traveled on the subway and saw all forms of architecture, parks, a palace, restaurants with interesting decor, the view from the rooftop of a hotel, went shopping, and had a great overall view of Budapest along with the wonderful companionship of Attila. The entire day was a great adventure and the tours are highly recommended."

Our guide for the day picked us up in the Trabant outside the hotel as arranged and introduced us to our vehicle for the day. I'm around 6'3, my friend is 6'2 and other pal not too far off 6'. It was a bit awkward for the three of us getting in and out of the Trabi, but it was relatively roomy (I've been far more squashed up on some airlines!). Our guide (Bal\u00e1zs) was brilliant, even though we had already explored the city on foot, he was able to tell us so much history about the buildings and statues and the country. We visited all the most noteable places, had plenty of stops to walk around, and of course, lots of time bombing around the city in the Trabi.Bal\u00e1zs was able to answer any questions we had, and took us to one or two of the more hidden gems of the city, away from the usual tourist treck. The driving was very safe - from a very skilled driver, if you are lucky enough to have Bal\u00e1zs as your driver, make sure you check out his youtube videos of Trabant driving skills! Is this really the best rated trip in Budapest? It's the only way to see Budapest!!Thank you very much :)"

My mother, sister and I booked the Trabant tour and family lunch with Andras (at short notice) and had the most amazing day out ever. My mother (in her seventies) was a little alarmed when she first saw the two Trabants that were arranged for us (somehow I imagined we would all be travelling in one - silly me!), but after a few explanations from Andras and his colleagues, she felt completely at ease. We packed a great deal of sight-seeing into the morning tour and Andras even amended it slightly to avoid some stair climbing, which my mother didn't feel able to manage. All the while we had a running commentary of all things Hungarian, from history to politics to cuisine. We stopped off at a lovely, Art Nouveau cafe in the center of town and ended up at Andras' parents' house for a delicious Hungarian lunch. Even though his mother didn't speak any English and his father's English was limited, we had a marvellous time and loved the feeling of getting to know some real Hungarian people. We also had a quick shot of traditional plum brandy, which just about shut down my nervous system. An acquired taste for sure!Spurred on by the success of our first tour, we ordered another tour later in the week to Szentendere and Viesgrad and this time our tour guide was Atila. This was another fabulous day out. Atila is a font of knowledge on all manner of things and we enjoyed getting to know him and chatting through the day. He was a joy to be with and nothing was too much trouble for him, as he tried to work out which area would have the best view and where the clouds might be. We even saw some storks on their nest (first time for me). I felt very sorry when the day was over and we had to say goodbye. If you are in any doubt about what to do in Budapest, look no further than Andras and his team. What a bunch of fantastic young professionals. We will certainly use them again on our next trip to Budapest."

We met two other ladies on vacation who also spoke English. Andras mother and father did not speak much english but they were very kind and genuine and his mother was kind enough to cook me a whole separate meal simply because I am vegetarian. By doing the lunch we got to see an area just outside the city we would have never gone to by ourselves. Andras was very accommodating with my grandmothers needs and even adjusted the price of our tour when she opted out of some things even though we had booked them in advance. He clearly trusts his customers alot. It was very refreshing to speak to a Hungarian tour guide who knew so much about his country and also a hunger to learn about me and my country. Attila took us to Szentendre and even though it was snowing all day we had a good time with him because he told great stories and made us laugh. He too seemed eager to engage in conversation and not just spit facts at us. We saw a wild boar! We went to Lake Balaton and Istvandy winery, both of which were beautiful even in the snow. Daniel, who greeted us at the winery, was warm and inviting. He was very casual and funny. We had an absolutely amazing meal (again I was specially treated with a wonderful risotto dish because of my vegetarianism) cooked by his girlfriend Czilla. Their guesthouse was in a pretty rural town and was absolutely luxurious. I only wish we could have stayed there a few more days! I will never forget our tour with mypersonalbudapest and I know my grandmother feels the same.

We were picked up by Balazs and Andras at our hotel and were driven to interesting locations in the city, that we knew very little about. Budapest has so many hidden corners and even for someone who speaks Hungarian and lived there for years (many years ago) it is very hard to keep up with all the happenings, new places and old / hidden treasures.We wholeheartedly can recommend this fun tour to anyone - even to locals! - who prefer to get true insider knowledge by excellent local guides, who love what they do. What we appreciated the most was really the mix of the places we visited that were off the beaten path and of course the sweet Trabant, that Balazs (owner of a Trabant collection) has proudly showed to us - the highlight was to have a look at the engine area... very special indeed! :)"

            "review": "\"Loved every minute!\". My 18-year-old daughter and I decided to take a side trip to Budapest during a recent stay in Austria, and with only 30 hours in the city, we wanted to really maximize our time. Andr\u00e1s did a fantastic job customizing our day, which included touring around in a Trabant in the morning, lunching at his parents' house, and spending the afternoon visiting a winery in the countryside outside of the city. He was very professional and prompt in his e-mail communications prior to our arrival, suggesting that we might prefer the winery visit when he learned we are students of wine. We loved riding in the very cool Trabant and found Bal\u00e1zs, the owner/driver, really delightful company. It was a treat to be able to get out and walk around at our various stops in Buda and Pest and not have to worry about parking! We got kind of attached to that little car and were sad to see it drive off when that part of our tour was over. Lunch with Andr\u00e1s's mom and dad was not only really delicious, but the experience satisfied that part of us that loves to get past being tourists and see how people really live. They were so sweet and welcoming! We left feeling we had made new friends despite the language barrier (Andr\u00e1s was great at translating for us - it was never awkward). We could tell his parents genuinely enjoy meeting and feeding Andr\u00e1s's guests. Our trip out to Etyek to visit the Herny\u00e1k winery was of particular interest to us, as we got to see the Hungarian countryside and taste Hungarian wines with the winemaker. The meat and cheese plate we were served there was a tasty ending to our day. As Andr\u00e1s drove us back to Budapest to the train station, we asked him to help with our Hungarian wine pronunciation. Now that's a video! Andr\u00e1s is a warm, open, flexible, knowledgeable, interested and interesting guide with a fun sense of humor - a super companion for the day. We were very well taken care of, and will definitely tour with him again the next time we are able to get to Budapest!"

He was very communicative over email when we were arranging the date of our excursion and what we wanted to do. The tour is really as advertised, customized and personalized. We started the day off with the Hidden Treasures tour. Got to see part of the old ghetto wall, an old aristocratic home and even walked around on the buda side. Some of the hidden treasures were unfortunately not available to us because of the weather but Andr\u00e1s did a great job of improvising.Then we stopped for lunch with his lovely parents! His mom made the BEST hungarian goulash as one of our courses! So glad she made it for us as I would have left Budapest without having tasted the best goulash in town! His dad is super sweet! Overall I have to say having lunch with them was one of my favourite experiences on the tour. We then went to a small winery a few minutes out side of the city and met a really lovely family and tasted many good wines. Again, it was a very small winery but the quality of the wine was really quite good! And because they are so small something you would not have access to outside of Budapest. Really it would have been a missed experienced had we not added the wine package to the tour. Overall the day was well spent getting to know Budapest like a local! Also loved getting a little bit outside of the city and seeing one of the smaller towns where the winery was. Thank you so much to Andras! You honestly made our trip. Thank you for accommodating us on a Sunday as well! We will definitely come to see you again when we are back in your lovely country!"

Saw My Personal Budapest recommended on tripadvisor and decided to book the trabant tour for our very first morning. My partner and I spent a good three and a half hours with Andr\u00e1s (guide) and Bal\u00e1zs (driver) touring around Budapest and seeing the main sights - not to mention getting some stunning photos! It is a superb way to see the city - not only is it different (the trabant cars are really something!) but it also serves as a great introduction; the rest of your trip becomes much easier to plan. You know where everything is, and you know what you want to go back to. I could not recommend this activity highly enough - Andr\u00e1s and Bal\u00e1zs are lovely (their passion for their city and country knows no bounds, and the sheer extent of their knowledge is just incredible); it's very reasonably priced; and it's definitely something to remember and talk about for years to come. The MyPersonalBudapest website is very user-friendly, Andr\u00e1s responds to any and all requests quickly and efficiently, and they pick you up from your hotel and drop you in a place of your choosing. If you pick one 'tour' to embark upon in Budapest, make it this one. We will definitely use them when we go again and would recommend them to anybody and everybody. Thank you Andr\u00e1s and Bal\u00e1zs for showing us your wonderful city - we'll be back! Helen and Dan."

Despite snow arriving on the day of our planned tour he contacted us at the hotel in good time to suggest some re-arrangements due to the conditions. This did not adversely affect our day, which was very informative, entertaining and done at a good pace with many good stop off points. As part of the tour we did his \"hidden Budapest\" and he was able to take us to places we would probably not have found on our own. We also took advantage of his somewhat unique experience of lunch at his family home and a chance to meet his parents which was a delight and something we will long remember. You can book tours with Andras with confidence of a professional service from a very knowledgable young man who understands and speaks English very well. Keep up the good work Andras and thank you.Ray and Janet"

We really felt like we were seeing the true Budapest as we had breakfast and lunch in wonderful local restaurants. We strolled large avenues and then little alleys, seeing parts of Budapest that I bet are not seen by other tourists . Andras took care of everything including the meals, desserts and daylong Metro passes.Both Bal\u00e1zs and Andras love their city, show it off beautifully.Too bad each city doesn't have an Andras!!"

He picked us up from our rented apartment and whisked us away to the Castle. We had never been to Budapest before and this was a fantastic introduction. Andras' tour was full of interesting and personal stories that highlighted the rich history of Budapest. He was extremely knowledgeable about the city and its history. We were able to pick out the attractions we wanted to return to and really planned our entire visit based on what we saw on the tour. Andras went out of his way to ensure that we saw as much as we wanted and really got a feel for the city. Riding in the trabants was an unexpected treasure. It was such a unique experience and I loved the quizzical and excited stares from onlookers. I really felt like we were a part of the city riding around town in the small cars. My favorite part of the tour was the hidden treasures Andras brought us to. Beautiful panoramic views and coffee house gems are just a few of the unknown attractions Andras showed us. We were fortunate enough to be able to have lunch with Andras' parents. I cannot fully describe what a wonderful experience this was. His parents graciously welcomed us into their home and cooked us a huge and delicious traditional Hungarian meal. It was hands down the best meal we had in Budapest. The language barrier was forgotten as we toasted together and told each other about ourselves, with Andras translating of course. This is an absolute must for anyone visiting Budapest! We are frequent travelers to Europe and have never been on such a great tour before. Andras really personalizes the tour and makes this foreign city feel like a home away from home. I highly recommend Andras' tour and would go on it again!"

Viking booked us into the Budapest Hilton near the Castle, and Atilla picked us up at 9am for the morning Trabant tour. After seeing many sights we finished the tour at noon, and had lunch at a \"all you can eat/drink\" buffet restaurant. It was excellent with great food! Then it was off on the Hidden Treasures tour.

The first full day, we did the Trabant tour, with Janos driving, and saw many beautiful places we could never have gotten to on our own. Then, we went to Andras' parents' home for a delicious home-cooked meal. I wish I could stay with his mom for a while and learn how to cook the way she does! The day was capped off with a private recital in the apartment of Adam Filegi. My husband and I are both musicians, and really appreciated the opportunity for such an intimate performance. Mr. Filegi is very friendly and an excellent pianist.It is very rare in any city to have the opportunity to visit people in their homes, and we got two visits in one day. On another day, we did the hidden treasures of Budapest, with many places we had never heard of, even with all of the pre-trip reading we did. Especially moving was the little piece of the wall of the Jewish Ghetto. Then, we went into the wine country for a private tasting. It was such a treat to be in the countryside on an autumn day and look out at the vineyards, then head inside the Hernyak Winery for some delicious wine and light snacks. The family who run the winery were friendly, and we learned a lot about how wine is produced. I know a lot of people think they can find everything on the internet, and that private guides are beyond their budget, but I would argue that every forint we spent was worth it. Budapest is a very large city, and it takes a personal guide to figure out the logistics and organize tours to make perfect days like the 2 days we spent with Andras. He is very popular, so if you are interested, you should contact him as soon as you know your dates."

Many stops along the way to take advantage of the picture opportunities. Attila has a very keen sense of good photographs...he has an artistic flair and helped us capture true Budapest. We met Gisela and George who prepared a fantastic Hungarian lunch for us in their home. They made us feel like we were family. Very warm people! Lots of laughs! We then returned to the city and began our walking tour. There are many hidden treasures within Budapest that we would never had seen without our very knowledgable guide. If you are coming to this beautiful city do yourself a favour and look up My Personal Budapest. You will not be disappointed."

            "review": "The best way to visit Budapest in two days. Andras provides the perfect way to see Budapest and the Danube Bend in two days. For the first day, we took the Trabant tour of the city. The Trabant is a Soviet era car that was manufactured in East Germany. It is very rare in Budapest today, and wherever we went, we felt like rock stars with people flocking around the little cars and taking photos. Andras rode in one of the two cars and communicated with the other via radio as we toured many of the important sites of this beautiful city, the Paris of the East. The two men who drove the cars were great also. One of them does trick driving shows in his car and will be glad to share the YouTube videos he has made. The day concluded wonderfully at the house of Andras's parents where we enjoyed a delicious traditional Hungarian meal prepared by his parents in their home; like Andras they are very gracious and personable, and we learned so much about life in Hungary today and in the past. In a short time we feel that we made friends for life.On the second day, Andras drove us to three towns on the Danube bend north of Budapest: Esztergom, Visegrad and Szentendre . These towns contain much of the history, culture and beauty of Hungary. We took the one-hour boat ride back to the city from Szentendre.Andras is a wonderful young man and through his eyes and guidance you will learn first hand about his city and its life. His tour is very deserving of its number one rating on Trip Advisor."

We booked Andras on our last day in Budapest, we thought we've seen most sights, and we wanted to go light and perhaps some off the beaten tracks away from tourists. This day became our most memorable day, Andras' tour is not a tour, it is an experience, and a truly unique one. Andras took time to find out where we've visited, so we would not visit the same place. Bringing us to the backlanes of Jewish Quarters, toured a historic bathhouse, enjoyed the best coffee at a grand cafe that was once a casino, rounding off this perfectly paced tour with a home cooked lunch that beat the best of Budapest restaurants. Any friends/readers thinking of Budapest in a day, you won't be disappointed."

My family of 5 just got back from a holiday in Budapest. We all had such a wonderful time. Since we were traveling with elderly parents and my 4-yr old son, we especially requested him to make sure we don't do too much walking so he drove us around in a private van and made sure our special requests were met. He was so nice and we appreciate his warm hospitality. I highly recommend his tour! "

Andras was our personal guide around one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Our day started with the Trabant tour. While waiting for Andras, Boulash (sic) the driver and loving owner of the Trabant explained the intricacies of the 2 stroke engine from the past. In this communist relic we visited all the normal tourist spots. Andras is passionate about his city and has every right to be so. We were able to discuss some historical facts and this seemed to impress Andras and the more he engaged on each and every subject.The second part of the tour was a Hungarian lunch at the home of his parents. This was a highlight of our tour. A lovely couple and in true Hungarian style made us most welcome.In the afternoon we visited sights that the normal tourist would never see. These I will not explain as it would spoil the surprise for those who subsequently take this tour.We took these tours on our first day in Budapest and during the next three days visited attactions pointed out by Andras. MypersonalBudapest tours are great value for money. We are returning to Budapest, probably next year and will again use Andras."

This would be something to do on your first or second day, as you'll then know where you want to visit again on your own.After lunch we headed off, this time in Atilla's car for a visit to an historic town about an hour out of Budapest. It was great to see a part of Hungary other than just the capital city.The fellows who own this business have an obvious love for their country and love showing it off to tourists. You won't go wrong if you get them to show you around."

Everytime we were back in the car he was deep in discussion with the very pleasant English speaking driver about \"Car things\". Andras found a lovely street cafe for lunch and in the afternoon we did the \"Places left out of Guidebooks\" tour. We really enjoyed this tour which was a combination of walking and riding on the subway. Andras was both knowledgable and passionate about Budapest and its history. His contacts allowed us into places you would never find on your own. I recommend buying a 24 hour subway pass as we used ours sailing the next day on the Danube River. It was a very pleasant way to spend several hours."

His parents are lovely and the food was absolutely fabulous. The wine was great too. After lunch - we drove back to the city and did a 3 hour walking tour of hidden treasures. Even though it was almost 100 degrees outside - we still had a great time talking and walking throughout the city. We took the subway twice - and so that was neat.

Szentendre also on the Danube is a charming artisan village with an interesting history and a meditteranean feel.

            "review": "Fun Trabis, Full Tummies. We don't normally like organized tours, but I was drawn in by the lunch idea and my husband was interested in riding in a Trabant. So, we decided to do this tour which included 3 hours of riding around beautiful Budapest in a Communist-era Trabant, then a home-cooked lunch in a Hungarian home. The whole thing was awesome and well worth it! My husband and I joined with a group of six ladies for the tour. We had three Trabants in all, each with a driver. Our tour guide, Andr\u00e1s, rode in one Trabant and communicated via walkie talkie with the other two during our tour. Couldn't have asked for a better guide! He was knowledgeable, professional, organized, personal, and fun. He speaks excellent English and German, so no worries there. We were driven to most of the highlights of Budapest, and we got out and walked around with Andr\u00e1s at most of the points of interest. There was ample time and opportunity for picture taking. After the tour, we were driven to Andr\u00e1s' parents' house for lunch. They were the sweetest and most hospitable people. The food was homemade by Andr\u00e1s' mother while Andr\u00e1s' and his father entertained us. First we had a toast with our choice of Unicum and/or Palinka (two must-try spirits of Hungary) along with appetizers of salami and pepper on bread. Then we stuffed ourselves with homemade goulash because (1) it was delicious and (2) we thought that was the only main course. Imagine our surprise when Andr\u00e1s' mother brought out a second dish of pasta with bacon and ricotta chesse! Trust me, it tasted much better than it sounds. We were already full, but the pasta dish proved to be equally delicious and irresistible, so we made room. Then there was dessert! Hungarian pancakes, similar to French cr\u00eapes, filled with walnuts and chocolate. After so much interesting sightseeing, great food, and enjoyable conversation with both Andr\u00e1s, his parents, and our fellow tourists, all we could manage for the afternoon was a nap! My husband and I both highly recommend Andr\u00e1s and MyPersonalBudapest, even for those of you who, like us, do not normally consider group tours. It was a perfect complement to our own personal exploration of Budapest."

We hired Andras to escort us to the Lake Balaton region on Saturday, May 12,2012. The region was a true gem. We arrived in time to see all the sailboats celebrate the beginning of the sailing season. We were taken to the peninsula of the Lake where Andras escorted us to a local winery. It was very evident that Andras had a unique relationship with the family that owned the property. We were treated like family. We were exposed to a cornucopia of local sausages and fresh vegetables for lunch. Our group was given a sampling of 5 wines made at the winery. The wines were exceptional. The winery went out of their way to accommodate the one vegetarian in our group with a delicious cheese platter and home made potato pancakes. This dining experience was the highlight of our trip. We spent 4 hours eating, drinking, laughing and enjoying the beautiful vistas afforded us at the winery. Andras treated us like we were members of his own family. Upon returning to Budapest Andras went out of his way to make our stay even more enjoyable. We were taken to a local ice cream shop where we purchased some of the local treats. Andras found out that even though we had been in Budapest for a few days we had not been to the Citadel... the highest point in Budapest where one can see the vastness of Budapest. The Citadel stop was not part of our tour but Andras felt it was important for us to experience this amazing panoramic view of the city. What was to be a 8 hour tour turned out to be a 9+ hour tour. All of us agreed that this tour was truly a highlight of our trip to Budapest and would not hesitate to recommend Andras as a tour guide for any of his wonderful tour excursions in Budapest."

I've travelled extensively and have been on many tours and this is NOT your typical drive by the highlights and bore them with the facts kind of tour. This tour gives you a personalized experience seeing both the popular sites and hidden treasures of Budapest.Andras is a very knowledgeable, personable and professional guide who made us feel comfortable immedately. He tailored the tour for us and we saw everything from Buda to the markets,the baths and those hidden cafes...just to mention a few of our stops. We enjoyed Andras' engaging style and I'll share just a little hint here: the answer to every question about Budapest is ...1896 (the year of their millenium celebration).We continued the tour by travelling about fifteen minutes to his parents' home where we were put at ease by their warm and gracious welcome. My compliments go to Andras' mother who prepared a traditional Hungarian meal that was absolutely exceptional.Thank you Andras for a wonderful and very memorable day in Budapest."

We spent the whole day with Andras which included two tours and a delicious traditional Hungarian lunch. I was quite nervous before hand, especially having lunch in someone's house, as I thought it may be awkward but it was the complete opposite. We were made to feel very welcome, we had a great time and the food was wonderful especially the Chicken Paprika which awas my favourite, however Agnes' mums homemade pickles were a very close second they were delicious . The two tours we had with Andras were briliant. We were taken in two Traband cars to the main tourist sites on both sides of the river - Andras was lovely he spoke great english and gave us a fantastic tour. I was in the second car which had radio contact while on the road but our Driver Janos also spoke english very well and was very entertaining too. Budapest is truley breathtaking. After lunch we went on the hidden treasures tour, this was a walking tour which along with many other amazing things included a visit to a Palace which was stunning and my favourite part of the tour. Andras hired a guide to take us through some of the rooms which were amazing to see. Great value and the best way to see the sites. They day past so quick. I would advise anyone going to Budapest to see the sites this way it was a great experience. Thanks Andras and friends. Debby"

I was travelling with two friends and we were initially a bit apprehensive. Our apprehension was totally put to rest when we met Andras. He is a very charming guide with very good English and a manner that put us at ease. It felt like having a tour with a friend. He is a very knowledgeable individual and we saw many sites that we would not have found on our own. We started by being taken around Budapest in two trabant cars driven by father and son Balazs and Janos, the cars attracted quite a lot of attention which was very amusing for us. We then went to the home of Agnes where she prepared a traditional Hungarian lunch, initially we were unsure about this but the meal was lovely and had even prepared a vegetarian option for me,again we were immediately put at ease by Andras and Agnes and we had a nice and relaxing lunch. Andras then took us on the metro to visit many more sites with the hidden treasures tours, they were certainly treasures as they were things that you would not have found on your own,the market,ghetto wall, ruin pub and many more.These tours are a must and definitely value for money. I can't wait to visit again with my family next year and I will definitely be organising one or two of the many tours that \"mypersonalbudapest\" tours offer. Thank you again Andras for a truly wonderful Budapest experience."

Honestly we were a little \"local guide tired out\". However, we booked Andras for his Country Side Tour of the Danube Bend and Etyek wine tasting on May 15, and had a great time. We visited the charming little towns of Szentendre, Visegrad, and Esztrogom, had a fanastic lunch in underground the restaurant operated by the church in Esztrogom. Andras combined a great mix of the present, historical, and local flavor for a great day. We finished the day with a wine tasting in Etyek with a cold plate dinner of Hungarian delights. It was the best tour we had during our 3 weeks in Europe. We would certainly recommend to anyone spending time in Budapest to book a tour with Andras Novak."

Andras customized the tour for us so that it covered some of the tourist highlights of Budapest along with some of the city's hidden treasures, followed by lunch at his parents' home.Andras was very knowledgeable and we immediately felt at ease with him. He provided great information on all the sites we visited and even modified the tour as we went in order to better accommodate our wishes.While the whole day was wonderful, the absolute highlight was having lunch with Andras and his parents. Being of Hungarian descent, we loved the food and the company. Andras' mother cooked a meal that was just like what my grandmother used to cook, and I know my mother enjoyed the Hungarian conversation (do not let this deter you though - Andras also speaks perfect English). We truly felt as though we were among family and were sad to have to leave! This isn't like the cookie-cutter bus tours that you see all over Budapest. This tour was personalized and even better than we had imagined it would be. We highly recommend that you book a tour with Andras if you are interested in seeing the real Budapest.Thank you Andras and family for a wonderful and memorable day."

The entire trip was outstanding but - the highlight of the entire two weeks was the day we spent with Andras in Budapest. We could not have asked for a more pleasant and knowledgeable guide. Andras customized a tour for nine of us which was full of information and attractions from 9 am to 10 pm. Had we been smart, we would have booked a second day with him although the information he provided us with on the first day did enable us to navigate well on our own the second day. The lunch served by Andras' mother was the best food we had throughout our trip and the hospitality of Andras' father could not have been more welcoming. The evening tour and dinner at a winery outside of Budapest provided another wonderful meal and the opportunity to see some of the countryside outside of Budapest. I have been reaping the benefits of travelers by reading through Trip Advisor information for years (I found Andras through Trip Advisor) and never thought I had any thing excellent enough to fully recommend. So, for my first post on Trip Advisor, if you are going to Budapest, be sure to include Andras Novak in your plans. www.mypersonalbudapest.com Ellen Stephen, Greer, SC: Ken Baerwalde, Ft. Mill, SC"

            "review": "The Best Tour You Could Ever Wish For. My wife and I booked a tour with Andras. We couldn't have asked for a better tour and had a fanstatic time. Andras was a man of faith, intregity, and professionalism and had a vast and deep knowledge of Budapest, ranging from the 100's to 1,000's years of history, to the Nazi's, to the Communist, and then onto more modern times. Andras met us at our hotel right on time and arranged for a trubant (sp?) to take us around. If you're like me, you may not know what a trubant is, well, it's a east German car. It's very tiny and was a blast driving around Budapest in to see all the major sights. Andras' driver was excellent and knew how to manuver around the city in such a way where we were never delayed and it was truly door to door service. He would drop us off at a site and when we were done, he would be waiting for us, so we didn't waste any time waiting around. We spent the entire morning driving to all the main attractions on the Pest side and then onto the Bud side of Budapest. The architure and vibe of the city is magnificent. We really only had one full day to see Budapest and it is quite spread out, and Andras took us places where we would have never been able to see on our own (from a time perspective, as well as just not knowing where certain things were). Some of the highlights of the tour included the Opera House, Parilment, City Park (where the thermal baths are a unique experience in and of themselves), we drove by mansion after mansion on the Andrassy Bouvlvard, visted a very grand, quaint, and charming coffee house, the Bud side castle or palace, the beautiful cathederal, Fisherman's Banstion & the Citadell (where the view of Pest was breathtaking). We couldn't have had a better time. That was only the morning part of our tour. Around 1PM Andras took us to his parents house for lunch. His parents were warm, loving and simply delightful and made you feel right at home. The lunch was excellent. We started off with a Tarragon Chicken soup with dumplings (we each had at least 2 - 3 bowls of it because it was so good), baked chicken and roasted duck with a nice sauce, paprika potates that were out of this world, and purple cabbage. It was authentic and wonderful lunch. Then it was out to the garden for some homemade apple strudel. Everything was top notch and we just fell in love with his whole family. Then it was off for the treasure hunt. I hadn't really thought about what it entailed, but when we left his parents house he they gave us a questionaire and Andras drove us back to Bud and had us go out and expolre the city on our own for severl hours and meet back up with him at the coffee shop we went to in the morning. The treasure hunt took us through Bud and Pest and we learned more and more about this beautiful city. We ended up on the bus, trams, and the metro. By the end of the treasure hunt we felt like we really knew our way around city and really got to experience it. After we met up with Andras at the coffeeshop and talked about our adventures, he then took us to a Ruin Bar (because I wasn't really sure what one was, but had read a bit about them in some tour books or on-line). We'll it was a great way to end the day because it was one of the most eclectic and unique bars I have ever been to in my life. It had a lot of art and fun stuff througout the place. It is hard to explain so you'll just need book a tour with Andras and experince it for yourself. Our day with Andras was probably one of the most enjoyable days of our vacation and believe me we went to some pretty amazing places througout Poland, Hungary and the Czek Republic. If you're going to Budapest make sure you book a tour with Andras because he'll make sure you have the best time of your life!! It was simply amazing!!! Doug Hope & MariluzArlington, Texas"

These were two full days but what fun!The Trabants were a hit wherever we went, the lunch with Andras' parents was wonderful and his parents made us feel like family. The piano concert by Mr. Fellegi was moving and unbelievable as he played his Steinway piano.The second day was equally wonderful - we saw Hidden Treasures that our son didn't even know existed and the Danube Bend tour was great and a wonderful opportunity to see the countryside.I can not say enough good things about Andras and My Personal Budapest.

Since we joined the segway tour already, which covered the inner pest area, we then asked Andras to arrange for us to see Buda areas instead. During the morning, we went to castle hill, margit island, galert hotel and spa, fisherman's bastion, and mathias church, also saw the budapest palace on the way up the hill. Then we had lunch at Andras parent's place (his mom cooks delicious hungrarian cuisines!), it was our friends birthday, so we asked if andras could arrange for a cake and we will pay him, however, he said it was free of charge, and a gift from them to us! How lovely. Then after that we opted for the 10 hidden places to visit which are not mentioned in the guide books. Overall the experience was good, especially the lunch, the BUDA visit in the morning was a bit rush as we wanted to see a lot in a short hour, Id say skip margit island. And visit PEST area with Andras would be a better option rather than doing the 10 hidden places. Some places we visited was a bit draggy, however we loved the cafes visit, very unique indeed. And the tour guide who was with us (Attila, a friend of andras) was very good, he dropped us at the shoes of danube and waited for us as requested (he worked over time!) - this place is a must visit, especially towards the evening when lights are lit up - breathtaking!

We were in the city from Philadelphia to visit our children who are living in Budapest for the next two years. From the beginning, we could tell how knowledgeable Andras was.

We took every advantage of the tour, including a wonderful \"authentic\" Hungarian lunch with Andras and his family. We were made to feel as if we were old friends - terrific food and interesting conversation, with Andres serving as guide/son/translator, shifting roles as required. After lunch, it was back in the car to resume the tour. The afternoon provided us with a rich experience, as the weather improved enough for us to take full advantage of all the major sites in the city - including some that were hidden from the regular tourist stops. at the end of the day, we were returned to the home of our children, much richer and wiser in the ways and culture of the city."

My only regret was that we missed having lunch at the home of Andras parents. We had already booked a tour through our cruise line, our mistake...we had already learned so much more from Andras...and we missed a great meal. Don't make the same mistake we did....do all of your Budapest tours with Andras. The price is reasonable, the service is outstanding and you get so much more for your time and money. Not only will you see and do things with Andras that you will never get from a tour bus, he also sees to your comfort and safety. A street vendor was being too pushy to buy their wares and Andras stepped right in and told them in a firm but polite manner to back away. The climbing on and off of a tour bus got old quickly, Andras with a private car and door to door service is the only way to go. In the end, we felt we had more of a feeling for Budapest than another 8 days filled with cruise line tours in 3 more countries. The difference was because of Andras. He really is the best."

We booked two half day tours. Day one, we were taken to see the local sights and the \"hidden treasures\" of Budapest. This was all great. But day two was what really stuck with us. Andras met us early and took us to Szentendre, a beautiful artisan village on the Danube Bend. We visited a ceramic shop in the home of a local family. This was no ordinary tourist stop. The couple there were warm and inviting, and after a brief demonstration on the pottery wheel, they gave us an opportunity to try it for ourselves. It certainly wasn't as easy as it looked and I soon found myself making a mess of things! But after some more encouragement and patience on their part, we were each able to produce a somewhat acceptable ceramic dish. Great fun and some good laughs. After this we took a stroll through the village, with Andras giving us a brief history of the area and also stopping at the local Christmas food carts to explain the foods available and the traditions behind each. Interesting stuff.The highlight of our day (actually our trip) was stopping at the home of Andras' parents for a traditional Hungarian lunch. Again, this was no ordinary tourist stop. Andras' parents graciously invited us into their home (on New Year's Eve, no less) with a warm greeting to go along with a few glasses of palinka. Think of it as a Hungarian grappa....burns going down but warms you all over! After this, we settled in for our lunch. My wife and I loved the restaurants in Budapest, but this was BY FAR the best meal we had during our stay, made all the more pleasurable by the warmth and kindness of Andras and his parents. We were told that it is different each time, so the only thing you need to know is that it was all delicious!After lunch and a great dessert, we said goodbye to his parents, and Andras returned us to our hotel, where we promptly cancelled our NYE dinner reservation as there was little chance we could even think of eating for the rest of the day! Also, a half day tour turned out to be from around 9am until after 3pm, making this an excellent value as well. Most places, this would constitute a full day. Excellent, excellent experience, and not to be missed if you find yourself in Budapest.Andras, thank you for providing a truly memorable experience and give our warmest regards to your parents. \"Boldog uj evet!!!\""

We had a wonderful day. Unfortunately the weather did not cooperate as we had hoped (it limited our views) but it was still incredible.Andras is full of information. He speaks english very well and was thorough and easy to understand. He covered a lot of ground with us during the course of the day. Our favorite moment being when he took us to his parents home for a home cooked hungarian lunch.his parents welcomed us with open arms and served us on of our favorite meals of the trip. his mother doted over us to make sure we ate enough. With a 20 & 22 year old sons who came with us she wanted to make sure they got 'enough'. :0) She is a fabulous cook and we had such a wonderful time.The afternoon was filled with a walking tour and we covered a lot of ground. I cannot think of a better way to get a 'feel' for the city than to hire a local guide. I highly suggest Andras."

Last weekend we had a Budapest tour with MyPersonalBudapest.We have arranged a Trabant tour (pritty funny staff), a home made lunch (the food was very good and the family is very nice and full of hospitality), and a hidden treasures of Budapest tour (we realy saw that you will never see usually) with our guide Andras.His tour and the time together helped us to understand more about the Hungarian culture, the local life of the city and the connection between past and present day in Hungary.His tour was more an educational city, and cultural tour flavoured with a personalized character than \"just\" a sightseeing tour in \"group under umbrella\".As we were searching for personalized tours and experiences with longer-lasting travel memories, his tour proved to be a right choice.If this is the case for you too, we fully recommend for you to contact him!"

Andras' friend provides the car and acts as driver. His enthusiasm for his car was evident and it is such a quirky car that it even attracted the attention of locals!After getting a bit orientated with the morning tour we then headed to Andras' parents for lunch. We were greeted so warmly and really treated as special guests. They are such a charming and delightful couple - it was an honour and a pleasure to visit their home. And then there was the food, wine and palinka! Andras' mother is a wonderful cook - we enjoyed lunch immensely. In the afternoon we did the city discovery tour which had us on and off public transport and in and out of local cafes and shops seeking help from locals with our 'tasks'. This was a great way to experience their friendliness and willingness to help the 'tourists'!In the evening Andras saw us onto an evening cruise along the Danube - so beautiful at night!The next day Andras took us to Szentendre where we met the loveliest couple who gave us the opportunity to try our hand on the pottery wheel. It was heaps of fun and afterwards we had a stroll through the gorgeous village. After this it was back to Andras' parents house for lunch again - an absolute highlight and it was with real fondness we said good-bye to them.Our last few hours with Andras were spent at a family run winery outside of Budapest. Our very engaging hostess explained about winemaking in Hungary and what they are working to achieve with their winemaking. We tasted a delicious selection of wines and had another beautiful meal here. Andras was a great guide. He was very knowledgable but delivered information about the history and life in Budapest in a relaxed and conversational way. It was really like touring around with a friend of a friend. He made life easy for us. He met us at our hotel each day. He was considerate and flexible about our itinerary. I think anyone who wants to experience more than just the main sights of Budapest and get a real feel for life in Budapest should organise a tour with My Personal Budapest."

The free walking trips are a great way to see the main tourist attractions of central Budapest but Andras provides a very economical way to see and experience life in Hungary away from the city centre. My wife and I are retired folk from Australia and we were on our first visit to Europe. We hired Andras for one and a half days and we had the most amazing time. On day one we drove to a small town outside of Budapest called Szentendre where we experienced a hands on pottery workshop before wandering around this pretty town renowned for its art and craft production. We then drove to his parents home for a wonderful traditional Hungarian lunch - his Mum and Dad were great company and the food was excellent. The day concluded with a visit to a winery where we were provided with a very informative tour of the property and feted with numerous wines to taste along with some sumptuous food. Day two was a half day walk around parts of Budapest to visit places that are not listed in the tour books or covered by the walking tours. We finished with lunch at a very traditional Hungarian cafe that most visitors would not find.Andras is a great guide and will formulate an itinerary to meet your wishes. He is extremely friendly, very knowledgeable and reliable. An absolute must if you want firsthand experience of Hungarian life."

He gave us a brief but concise history of Hungary, and brought us into the life of a hungarian by sharing well-chosen stories about the people and country. His unique tours show you a beautiful glimpse of Hungary you would never see or know otherwise. Andr\u00e1s is highly qualified in his line of work- he took me and my boyfriend through Szentendre, the Danube bend, Visegr\u00e1d, Esztergom and even Slovakia. Each city had its own charm and had particular attractions to see. All the cities shared a picturesque setting, welcoming a more relaxing pace from the hustle and bustle of Budapest. La piece de resistance of the day was the wine tour in Etyek. We were taken to a private estate of a family run vineyard. The family was very welcoming and friendly. They explained everything from how they produced the wine, to shipping it out to restaurants- all while making sure our wine glasses were never empty. This particular vineyard had a Michelin star restaurant buying their wine, so you can imagine the high quality of wine. After a tour of the wine cellar we were brought up to the kitchen which was cozy and elegantly decorated with vintage Hungarian decor. Sitting by the fireplace with a glass of fine wine in hand, enjoying tasty salami's, cheeses and homemade bread was an experience which will forever stay in our memories. Thank you kindly to Andr\u00e1s for his carefully chosen tours of a hidden, understated Hungary."

            "review": "A memorable day in Budapest. I recently travelled to Budapest with a group of friends and family members and considered hiring a local private guide. After experiencing some difficulties finding a reliable guide, I found MyperonalBudapest and its guide, Andras, through Trip Advisor. My mission was to make an effort and organize this day in Budapest so that the group members would have fond memories for many years to come. I wanted to immerse in the Hungarian culture as much as possible in the time available. Following a number of emails we worked out an itinerary to suit everybody in our group. I requested Andras to take us through parts of Budapest by foot and/or public transportation to better interact with the locals. Andras embraced this idea and furthermore, he suggested that he combines it with a point-to-point drive in 4 Trabants in their original condition. Our morning started at 8:00. Andras, very punctual, meeting us at the hotel, and using the public transportation took us to the private studio of Mr. Adam Fellegi, a famous Hungarian pianist. I had previously requested Mr. Fellegi, via MyperonalBudapest, to take us through Franz Liszt\u2019s artistic life with relevant fragments of his creations from his early years through his mature period as a composer. Mr. Fellegi, who is a charming individual, surprised us with having an opera singer, Mr. Jekl Laszlo join us in his studio to further emphasize Liszt\u2019s contribution to opera. Toward the end of our engagement, Mr. Fellegi played at our request a number of pieces, including Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in Blue, without any previous preparation. The experience we had was great, to listen to an internationally renowned pianist, in his own studio, playing anything we would ask. After the Liszt musical lesson we boarded an air conditioned van and were taken to a typical Hungarian home where we were served a traditional, Hungarian lunch. While in the van, we were given a brief Hungarian history starting from the original settlers in the Pannonia Valley all the way through the Austro-Hungarian Empire, communist era, and the latest political changes. The lunch was delicious, home made pastries, the traditional palinka, home made gulyas and local wine to match the food. The desert was a delicious cake and fresh fruits. One of our group members had her birthday on that day, and was pleasantly surprised by having been served a birthday cake along with the Happy Birthday sang in Hungarian.Following the lunch we returned to the city center and started our Trabant experience. For the following 3.5 hours, we were shown the highlights of Budapest: architectural marvels, cultural edifices, a beautiful caf\u00e9, and the way of life on a typical weekday in Budapest. The car is a hallmark of the communist era. I thought it was a great idea to go back in time and see the communist Budapest in a typical communist era means of transportation. The car drivers were all very friendly and knowledgeable of their cars. The experience turned out to be another highlight of the day.The Trabant journey ended at the Danube Palace Theatre where the young members of our group, engaged into a traditional folk dance class hosted by two professional dancers. It must have been one of the most enjoyable activities of the day, both for those directly involved in the dance class as well as those observing the dancers. After 1.5 hours of hopping, jumping, and beating boots, we attended a show performed by professional dancers; a live illustration of historical and modern times Hungarian folk dances, choreographed by the same couple that taught our younger members. At around 10:30 pm we finalized the day on a night cruise on the Danube with dinner.  Andras was a exceptional tour guide. He organized the various meetings with the people involved in the various activities, purchased our public transportation tickets, arranged for food, purchased the show tickets, the boat tickets, took care of ALL organizational details. There were no glitches; everything went smoothly. We did work out all the details prior to our meeting via emails. Andras definitely knows how to manage a day, and as such, all activities planned did happen. Overall we had a great day and really enjoyed our time in Budapest. Andras representing MyperonalBudapest was not only a great guide, but his knowledge and organization skills truly made the difference. I, and everyone in the group, highly recommend him."

The day started with an exciting tour in a Trabant, drawing a lot of attention from other tourists and being photographed by several others. We found the tour to be most helpful to get an understanding of and to experience life in Budapest, giving us time to revisit some of the sites on the other days. This was followed by an excellent and tasty lunch and then for me personallly the highlight: a visit to a winery at Etyek, about 25 km from the city. We were hosted and introduced to the winery's wines by the owner's wife at the most beautiful setting. All this was made possible by Andras, with an excellent knowledge and easy going nature, which led to a wonderful experience of Budapest.

Encouraged by a great experience in Sarajevo and Belgrade with an outstanding guide Zlatan Ilic http://alturl.com/ce4yi we decided a personal guide was a must if we were to see anything of the Hungarian capital. When we first made contact with Andras we listed our 'must sees' as well a run down on what we both like to do when we visit a new city. He promptly came back to us with a tailor-made itinerary, this started with a decidedly-different city tour with us being whisked off through the narrow lanes of Budapest in a communist-era Trabant. With his colleague Balazs at the wheel we spluttered back and forth across the river Danube stopping at one breathtaking sight after another. Three hours later Andras drove us to his parent's house in the suburbs where we enjoyed a delicious, traditional Hungarian lunch prepared by his mother. Mrs Novak, now a successful businesswoman, gave us a first-hand account of her country's transition from Communist rule. Chatting to her gave us an insight not normally enjoyed by tourists. Part of Andras's 'unique selling point' is that his tours are a little 'quirkier' than the others. That afternoon proved the point: we could barely take in all he showed us. Starting with an Art Nouveau cafe and museum we moved on to the city's Jewish Quarter (great for photography) stopping to enjoy the traditional Flodni cake at Rachel's Bakery. The next stop gave us a chance to catch our breath in the famous Ruin Pub, now a standard bearer for underground culture. As he walked us back through Budapest's 8th district to our hotel we were struck by his stockpile of anecdotes as every building, monument and business seemed to inspire yet another one. A truly remarkable day! We would recommend Andras to any traveller who wants to experience Budapest!Robert Mullan Liz Russell www.robertmullan.com"

Andras was a fantastic guide and he explained aspects of Budapest's history that show the knowledge and love he has for the city. I really enjoyed hearing about the history of the city and the devastation but also the perseverance of Budapest. I also never realized how affected the Jewish community in Budapest was hit during the persecution and was moved by the synagogue area. I also thoroughly enjoyed the winery. It was so beautiful to be able to see the crowded city and then in a short drive to also see the countryside that was just incredibly beautiful. My favorite part of this tour though was getting to spend time with local people from the Trabant drivers, to lunch with Andras's mom, to the owner of the vineyard. We had a very short time in Budapest but I left feeling like we had a very complete trip and I learned a lot about the city and had too much fun doing it!"

Seeing the architecture and historical sights of Budapest was wonderful, but being immersed into Hungarian culture is what made Andras's tour truly unique. Initially, we were supposed to do a wine tasting but the wine makers had to cancel. Andras knew how much we were looking forward to it, so he arranged with the wine makers to do a tasting before our flight. It was not the most convenient time for Andras but he made arrangements to make sure we were able to make our flight on time. It was a great way to end our trip (again, superb hospitality) and we were so grateful to have such a great tour guide. I had no idea what to expect from Budapest, but it totally exceeded my expectations- in large part because of Andras. He made our holiday an absolutely outstanding one."

We loved the Trabant tour.. just know that the car is VERY small. But it was such a different experience and it was soo fun to watch peoples reactions when we were driving around. Lunch at Mom and Pop's house was the highlight. AMAZING! They were so nice too.. we wanted them to adopt us. They really made us feel at home. I feel lucky to have had such a unique experience. I will no doubt recommend this tour to anyone who visits Budapest. Thank you so much Andras and sorry for waiting so long to post the review.. We had the greatest time! H+K"

My husband, daughter and I have just come back from an amazing trip to Austria, Slovakia and Hungary and I have to say, our day with Andras was one of the highlights. We are very interested in history and in seeing things from a local perspective and Andras more than fulfilled our expectations which were high based on the feedback given here by others. The Trabant tour was very fun, and as others have expressed, we felt like we were the tourist attractin at times! Lunch with Andras' parents is a must do. We were taken into their home as guests and felt like we had made new friends. Hopefully they will contact us if they ever make it to Norway :) The tour to Szentendre was very nice and Andras never made us feel stressed although we aren't the quickest of tourists...taking about 500 pictures! I highly recommend this trip...you will never forget it!"

This was our second visit to Budapest, so we opted for \"10 hidden treasures - things not found in guide books\" which were varied and fun, particularly with Andras to chat with on the way. The Art Nouveau cafe was interesting, the Central Europesn Jewish cake was good, the fountains were fun, the pub in a ruined building was zany and the remnants of the ghetto wall very moving. Andras parents were great hosts for lunch, and it is always good to get out of a city centre and see what it is really like yo live there. With the help of the Hungarian / English and English / Hungarian parts of the dictionary, we all found we could talk about anything, and felt like we had made new friends. Perhaps when you visit, Andras's mother will be trying out the Scottish gingerbread recipe we have since sent her. The next morning we had the pleasure of visiting Mr Fellegi for a concert of Liszt, Bartok, Chopin and Bach all played with not only skill but Hungarian fervour. My daughter is a pianist and post-graduate music student, so we had arranged this as a treat for her, but all three of us enjoyed it very much. It was actually rather sad parting with Andras. like others, we felt we had made a new friend. The cost of the tour was not unreasonable for what was provided. Andras is knowledgable, well organised, flexible and very good company. his tours are well worth a go."

This experience did not disappoint. Andras Novak is an enterprising entrepreneur with a personal touch, and he has named his business well. After customizing my tour via his website, he contacted me to make certain that my selections were going to meet my needs. We modified my first selection, and as a result, the second half of my day was spent at a beautiful family run vineyard about 45 minutes out of Budapest. My work colleague and I did his \"best of\" tour, and it was perfectly fine for an overview of the city. We saw all the top sites, and it gave us enough to know which places to visit on our own. Budapest is spread out, and it would be difficult to walk all the sites, so Andras's driving us around was the way to go. We were treated to lunch my his most delightful parents, and with an excellent menu, the conversation was very pleasing. His mother is a wonderful cook, and we teased her that she is becoming world famous on TripAdvisor! His father was a gracious host, and the warmth of their home made our visit unique. I have never been invited into someone's home as part of the tour, and I certainly enjoyed. After a leisurely and delicious lunch, we headed to the country for a great wine tasting. Glasses were filled with Sauvignon Blanc, Cuvee, and Pinot Noir, and we got some great lessons on the local varietals. I came home with two bottles, too! All in all, I recommend MY PERSONAL BUDAPEST for the traveler who wants to learn enough of the city without doing the standard tour guide stuff, and for someone who wants a personal, local connection. I was glad I stayed the extra day before returning home to the US after by business meeting."

I explained that we had children and their ages, 6 and 11. I explained what I was looking for in a tour. He was very fast at returning my email and had sent some ideas for me to look over. After review, I sent my choices to him. Everything was scheduled and a price was agreed.The day of the tour he met us at our hotel on time and was very excited to meet us and show us his country. We started out on the Trabant tour. The lttle cars were so cute. My children just loved them. The tour took us all over from the Gellert Hill, Castle District, Around Parliament and Central Pest. There were many stops for sight seeing and photos. When we would stop and get out of the Trabant cars everyone would be looking, because the cars are so neat. My husband said, he felt like he was part of a tour. It was really cool.After the Trabant tour we headed for Andras home for lunch. We were greeted by his parents upon arrival. They were so kind and made all of us feel welcome. The luch was wounderful. We had chicken soup, Hungarian chicken paprikas, home made noodles and Hungarian cake. Everyone one had seconds it was so good. After coffee on the patio we departed to our next adventure.We were on our way to a ceramic workshop near Szentendre. Laszlo and Gabriella the owner of the shop showed us around and then the kids got involved in making bowls. They both did such a great job. A thank you to them for the gift that they share. We then drove to the little town of Szentendre. After arriving and walking around we purchased our memories and headed back to Budapest after walking along the Danube. Such beauty in this part of the world.We had a little time available before our river boat tour. My family and Andras found a nice spot near the dock to sit and rest. Andras helped my husband chose a nice glass of red wine for him and a white for me. We talked about everything we had just experienced and thanked him for showing us Budapest. We will be returning in the fall and doing the wine tour without the kids. :} Thank you, see you soon Andras!!!"

Although he talked English because of some other British clients we could ask questions in German. His knowledge of both languages is marvellous (much better than my English). We learnt a lot about Hungarian history and he showed us the most beautiful and interesting buildings and explained the different architectural styles. We also had a look at some romantic places. After this tour next day there was time to visit our favorite places again and spend some more time in locations of our special interest.We (4 Germans) booked an excursion to the \u201eDanube Knee\u201c. Andr\u00e1s showed us the small artisan town Szentendre and the biggest cathedral of Hungary in Esztergom, where the first king of Hungary was crowned. We could feel that Andr\u00e1s is proud of his country and he loves it with all its changeful history. One high-light was a wine tasting in a small vineyard in Etyek. Our host showed us their cellar and explained a lot of wine-making. They offered a little delicious snack and of course several different wines. The taste was great. We enjoyed the day with a really good and engaged guide Andr\u00e1s. Thank you for a beautiful trip in your home country.Claudia and J\u00fcrgen"

            "review": "Fantastic experience!. Words can not begin to describe our feelings after such two great days spent visiting and experimenting Budapest and the Hungarian country side, in such a friendly way. Let us try to describe our 2 days tour:\u2028\u2028We (my husband and I) started the first day visit with a Trabant tour. Andras was waiting for us in our hotel, and our first impression was that he is very reliable, professional and well educated tourist guide. The young gentlemen who was providing the Trabant was very enthusiastic about his car, and we could see that he was taking much care and pride in maintaining the antique in good shape. We went to the castle and Andras explained us lots of interesting facts about the Hungarian history. After they took us to a tour around the city, and a stop in a very nice caf\u00e9 which is an Art nouveau furniture museum at the same time. As an industrial designer, I found this visit quite interesting, to see all these different kinds of rare furniture.\u2028\u2028Then, Andras took us to his parent\u2019s home, which was a lovely home located in a residential neighborhood. I found it nice to see how it looks like outside the city center. Andras\u2019s parents made everything to make us feel like at home, and let me tell you how much we have eaten as if we were kings! I wish I could have seen Andras\u2019s Mom cooking, so that to learn some of her secrets!\u2028\u2028After, Andras and his father brought us to Szentendre, where we visited the lovely village. Afterwards began some moments that I will never be able to forget! We went to a ceramic workshop in Szentendre and met with some very friendly people (Gabriella and Laszlo), who were patient enough to teach us the basics of pottery making; my husband and I both had the opportunity to try a ceramic piece of art each. It was such a sensual and technical experience! We had so much fun trying to do our ceramic piece! It is a pitty that we live so far away from Hungary as we both felt that we could become good friends with them!\u2028\u2028We ended our day with a private piano concert, in a famous pianist\u2019s appartment, Mr. Fellegi. This was, in my opinion, a MAGIC moment, something I will still remember when I will be an old lady (!) It is hard to explain the feeling of being \u00abinside\u00bb the music and not only listening to the classical music on a CD or the radio. Mr. Fellegi really made us feel comfortable and we were in the right atmosphere to enjoy the piano concert.\u2028\u2028The second day was even more unforgettable: Andras and his father took us to the city of Eztergom, we had the opportunity to cross the Danube to see Slovakia, and we also visit Hungary\u2019s largest church, which is on top of a hill with a beautiful view on the Danube and Slovakia. We also had lunch in a great restaurant (here my husband will recommend the Transylvania soup that is incredibly tasteful and delicious!)\u2028\u2028We visited the country side and we ended our day in a vineyard. I believe this was my husband\u2019s favorite part! The lady, Vali Herny\u00e1k took the time to explain us about her familly\u2019s winery business and made us taste many different wines (all very - very nice!) We could see how much love she puts in her art and we very much appreciated the time she spent with us. We also had a plate of local home-made cold cuts and cheese (again, incredibly delicious with the last wine we have tasted). Again, and sorry for repeating myself! we felt that we could have become good friends with this lovely lady and husband as we share the same vision of work and life.\u2028\u2028Everyone we have met with Andras were friendly and warm in a genuine way. We feel that we have some friends now in Hungary and almost a familly there!\u2028\u2028Not only that, but we were never rushed through the events and location, giving ample time to enjoy the activities in a tailored fashion. Also Andras was very organised and everything run smoothly during the 2 days.\u2028\u2028Needless to say at this point that we highly recommand the personnal tour provided by Andras and let us tell you that it is worth every penny invested.\u2028\u2028Regards from Canada,\u2028\u2028Caroline and Fran\u00e7oys\u2028\u2028P.S. We read an other comment on this site that we can barely understand! The car that was supplied to do the tour was a Corolla in very good condition, and pretty recent. Why would some members of TripAdvisor use this site to put down in an exagerated way some facts? Opinions are opinions but facts should be based on reality, so that Trip Advisor can continue to be a reliable tool."

            "review": "This is a tour well above and beyond expectations!. As a frequent solo traveler, I have often found standard group tours to be impersonal and uniform. Admittedly, I am a tour guide and that sometimes makes it hard to concentrate on the tour & not the tour guide\u2019s technique. After reading previous reviews, MyPersonalBudapest seemed to exactly fit my needs and wants. I contacted Andras and arranged for a personal two-day tour, including airport transfers.My two day tour went by quickly... almost too quickly. Looking back, I realize that I never felt that I was on an actual tour. It was, as if, a trusted friend had invited me to visit Budapest, then proceeded to show off its greatest attributes. Andras provides a warm and gracious welcome to Budapest\u2019s best charms... the food, history, architecture and most importantly the local hospitality. On the first tour day, I was greeted by Balazs, a Trabant owner/driver. The driving tour was wonderful with Andras giving details on what we saw, explaining the history of where we were, plus we stopped several times for better views and history focus. Balazs is a very sweet, friendly man who kindly (and humbly) answered all my Trabant questions, allowing me to check out the engine, and even told me about his weekend stunt driving activities. Yes, I am somewhat fascinated by older cars.Afterwards, Andras & I visited Szentendre where local ceramic artists introduced me to molding clay into functional art. I never imagined that I would actually touch the clay, not to mention make something! It was hard work, but a really fulfilling experience. I may have to sign up for classes in the future. The first day ended with the local pub night, which was a lot of fun. We were joined by a few of Andras\u2019 friends, which only made the experience more authentic. What\u2019s drinking at the pub without a few friends? We visited three distinctly different (non-touristy) pubs & I never felt out of place or even noticed... excellent. The second day began walking around the city, as Andras pointed out hidden treasures not mentioned in guide books. I particularly liked this part of the tour; because I\u2019m pretty sure I would not have found these places. After lunch we visited Etyek, spending time at a family run winery. Instead of listening to a lecture or presentation, there was a conversation explaining what they do and what they hope to do. I was introduced to how the family produces their wine, the different ages of their vines, the makeup of the region\u2019s soil & their future foray into brandy making. I left Etyek much more knowledgeable about the Hungarian wine making process, with a great bottle of wine and a full stomach. On both days, lunch was a meal brilliantly cooked by Andras\u2019 mother. Andras\u2019 parents are a welcoming, funny and engaging couple. Upon entering the house, I was greeted with hugs & plum palinka (yum). The excellent food was served at the family dining table surrounded by family photos and books. Afterwards, coffee was enjoyed out on the terrace while soaking up the sun\u2019s rays. On the second day, Andras\u2019 mother could not be there, but she thoughtfully prepared the meal before leaving for the day. Andras\u2019 father was wonderful as he presented & served his wife\u2019s efforts. Just imagine visiting an aunt & uncle that you haven\u2019t seen in a long time, and being welcomed with home cooking and good conversation.Because I opted for a personal tour, Andras offered to include or substitute places/activities, depending on my preference. I declined as I was perfectly happy with the agreed upon tour. I would not have changed a detail of this unique Budapest tour, except maybe to add another day. MyPersonalBudapest provided me with fabulous memories, well above and beyond my expectations. I can easily recommend taking this tour & I whole-heartedly encourage other Budapest visitors to sign up for this one-of-a-kind experience. Andras is the perfect host to introduce the wonders of Budapest."

Budapest has been on my 'travel wish list' for years, and for this reason, I wanted this trip to be perfect ... and it was! A couple of weeks before our arrival, I had a long E-Mail exchange with Andr\u00e1s regarding the preparation of the trip - we finally choose a quite rich program : Day 1: We started with a city tour was very interesting and gave us a first overview of Budapest and the places to see. The 'Hungarian' lunch was delicious and it was very interesting to visit a genuine Hungarian home (OK, the trip was a bit long, but finally worth it). Finally, a treasure hunt made us raise our heads and notice funny details we would never have discovered alone \u2026Day 2We started at 9 with an Art-D\u00e9co tour in two vintage cars (a Citro\u00ebn Traction from 1954 as well as a Rolls Royce Silver Spur) - this was just gorgeous, and we discovered numerous partly incredible treasures - with very competent guides (we had almost a ratio of 1:1 between guides and tourists ;-). We then had lunch in what Andr\u00e1s called the \"best pancake bar in town\" - this was not extraordinary, but correct. In the afternoon, we enjoyed a relaxing tour on the Danube and then headed to the climax of the stay: a private concert given by a famous Hungarian pianist at his home. This was gorgeous, especially for me as an amateur pianist - and we were so pleased that we invited the pianist to play for our friends when he will next come to Switzerland - which will be in two months. If you are looking for a way to \"deep dive\" into the Hungarian Culture and the architectural, cultural and social heritage of Budapest, then I can recommend Andr\u00e1s without any reserve. Although some of the reviewers find that the trip is expensive, I do not share this position - we came back with tons of beautiful images and interesting information - and this is something money finally can't buy! Thanks Andr\u00e1s, we really enjoyed our discovery of Budapest!"

You start off with a great view of the city, get to see all the famous historical sites, and learn a ton of information from a native Budapester. The best part is.. for lunch you actually go to his parents house and get a home cooked meal! That alone makes it worth it, you can't get something unique like this unless you have family there or know someone. In the afternoon, you play an Amazing Race style game where you run around Budapest gathering information about different landmarks and hopping on busses and metros in the process. It forces you to interact with the locals while learning cool stuff, and the competition is also a lot of fun. Nothing like seeing your friends running in the distance towards the bus you caught in the nick of time. The day ends with a night cruise, which gives a whole different perspective on the city. I wish they would do this kind of thing in more cities.."

Having never visited Budapest, or Hungary for that matter, my partner and I knew little of it apart from what we had read but many websites focussed on the city's obvious USP's (unique selling points) like the cave system and the spas and less so on the wonderful hospitality and the sights and sounds of the contrasting areas of Buda and Pest. Many websites also concentrated on restaurant reviews, however we found a gem that most people never know about, unless they had contacted you. Our second stop on our tour, if you recall, after visiting the beautiful riverside town of Szentendre was for a genuine home cooked family meal. At that point I knew we'd booked something truly special that a large tour operator could only wish to replicate, and fail. Not only was the food delicious but the hospitality was amazing and we left feeling very full!All of the travel was taken care of which was fantastic and we were given plenty of opportunities to explore the town for ourselves. you found the right balance between being a tour guide and letting ourselves wander. You also organised our cruise of the Danube and took us to a fun ceramic making session where Alexandra and I still argue about who made the best plate. For the record, it was me! If that wasn't enough we also had time to squeeze in a visit to a family vineyard where after sampling lots of wine we were able to sit, eat and reflect on a great four days in your country.So, to us, the people are what made Budapest the great holiday it was and we would like to thank you Andras. Best wishes to your family also. I thoroughly recommend you and mypersonalbudapest to anyone who's looking to do something different on their vacation and have completely unique stories to tell when you come home. Please feel free to use my comments on your own website and I wish you the best of luck for the future - until we return for more.Kind regardsKarl & Alexandra"

I have requested a specially tailored itinerary to our needs and wishes months before our trip and Andras was the only local guide that rendered very detailed advises and assistance in all ways to make sure that our trip is an enjoyable one not restricted only in budapest but other leg of our europe trip as well.

Andras was also very knowledgeable and passionate about spreading the Hungarian culture, history and way of life, and it was extremely enriching and truly eye-opening as we learnt about Budapest and Hungary from him. It was really an unforgetable experience to have lunch at his house, where we had the rare chance to taste true Hungarian cuisine and to interact with his parents to get to know the true Hungarian way of life! Not forgetting his mother, a true warrior, during the snow war with all the kids. They really enjoyed it!

Reliable, helpful and very implicated we had been taken in charge after he perfectly understood our expectations. I am not complicated and so looking only after pure and authentic local ambience at reasonable but affordable price that can save us time and disillusions. Andras managed on a 2 day notice to understand how different my expectations are. We asked for more city aspects than only the main general attractions and to have a tour in a way we can get the flavour of the past years including underground, gastronomy, ethnical, cultural and night life. Andras managed in 24 hours with 2 Trabants and a magnificent timing to bring us in places you can not even imagine. And the most appreciable was the lunch that his mother prepared in their house. Thank you to all his family and friends that supports him to organise the poetic way of looking at Budapest. We recommend to everybody interested to see through Hungarian eyes this third capital on the Danube.Maryse and GeorgeBelgium"

We were looking for a tour to familiarize ourselves with Budapest and its sites but wanted to feel we were visiting family who was showing us around. Andras delivered just that. We contact him prior to arrival to arrange the Trabant sightseeing tour with the lunch at a Hungarian Home. The Trabants are very unique. People could not help look at us in these little weightless cars. They drove through very narrow streets even backroads we are sure the tour buses can't. The drivers who own the Trabants actually collect them and race them on 2 wheels! Amazing. The tour was at a great pace and reduced quite a bit of the walking which waas great for us. My friend Marta had just broken her foot and removed the cast right before the trip so she was concerned she would not be able to see everything or keep up walking but Andras kept the pace and the cars really made it all work. Make sure to share with Andras as much as possible about your interests so he can make additional suggestions for a truly unique experience. The Lunch was amazing and felt like we were part of the family. We kept comparing the Bean Goulash Soup we had at the home but none was better! As we toured with Andras, we shared about our love for wine and our interest to visit a local winery. He was so good to immediately check into it and he made arrangements with Hernyak Winery. I was left speechless once we arrived and tasted the wines. They are all handmade and the winemakers are so personable and friendly. We ate in the vineyard and remember the sun going down and the dining table getting dark just lit by the light of the fireplace... we could have been there exchanging stories for hours! Simply priceless folks."

However, Andras crafted a full day. 3-hour Trabant tour of the city, a marvelous meal at his parents' home and an amazing private concert of Hungarian composers by a concert artist in the pianist's own home. The music was the perfect end to a delightful day, and the meal and the music certainly put us in touch with a more personal view of Hungary and Budapest. The Trabant ride was spectacular (and tight!) for those with an interest in historic cars...driven by true Trabant lovers and collectors. The day was indeed expensive, but the personal nature of the tour AND the private concert made it worth every penny."

We contacted Andras after arriving in Budapest and he very willingly arranged, on very short notice, a personal tour of the highlights of this wonderful city. He went out of his way to show us things of interest that we would have found difficult to visit ourselves without a car. He has a very obvious passion for his work and for the city and country within which he lives. Our visit to the beautiful artists' village of Szentendre was wonderful, but my personal favorite was having fish, chips and local beer at an outdoor restaurant sitting right next to the Danube. This was obviously the real Budapest, and not a place that tourists would ever know to visit."

The history is a given in broad strokes, but the details that matter to me are in the interchange of questions about culture, people, and issues of today. Facts cannot be easily forgotten, but to me the most memorable and endearing way to know Hungary is to take a trip with Andrej. Lunch with his parents is a true highlight. They too are warm, sincere, and genuine. The food is homely. It is a personal and unique experience. The 'treasure hunt' of the second half of the tour is an independent interactive questionaire. The 'treasure' is in walking a city, learning the facts, and meeting the people. Great idea. This the reward of an experience that will leave an unforgettable memory in our hearts and mind."

We had such a great time and were jealous of the couple who also was on the tour with us who had signed up for the cooking class and were shopping for some of the ingredients. so when we went back to Budapest this summer we signed up for the cooking class. Andrew was our guide and cooking instructor and it was as great as we had hoped. Before you arrive you can choose from several appetizers, entrees and desserts. We debated over a few and settled on a sour cream soup, chicken with pasta and floating island bourbon vanilla custard dessert. Mostly we wanted things that would show us something new and that we might actually be able to make again at home. I would say we chose well! For the pasta we learned how to make the noodles over boiling water, something we had never done before but can be easily done at home. Also, the floating island custard was maybe not something we would make every day but it is great to have an impressive dessert if I need one and just making the custard (and freezing it into popsicles) was a great post-trip summer treat. Andrew is a fantastic host and teacher and they send the recipes and instructions again after your lesson! Loved the whole thing, will do a different menu next time we are in Budapest!"

I know a handful of Hungarian recipes, but this seemed like the perfect opportunity to expand upon that and learn some more traditional recipes. I have to say, this was the highlight of a month long trek through Europe (which included 7 other cities and numerous TripAdvisor activities). We had booked this activity before leaving on our trip, and I\u2019m incredibly glad we did it. Agnes was a breeze to communicate with, and her responses were always quick, and before we knew it we were meeting Andrew at the Market Place at 9! Definitely do not eat breakfast if you opt for the market tour. While on a food tour in Berlin, our guide had told us we absolutely must do a food tour in Budapest \u2013 which this basically is if you opt to take the market tour. We sampled so many fine foods and treats it was essentially the same as a food tour \u2013 so, you pretty much get two activities done in one. Perfect! Andrew was simply the best host. He was entertaining, knowledgeable, and hilarious. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Not only did we leave there with some hands on knowledge on how to make cabbage rolls and soup, but Andrew was able to teach me a few tricks on how to improve my culinary technique \u2013 and I\u2019ve been cooking for 10 years. This is an absolute must if you\u2019re coming to Budapest. I highly recommend this class. It\u2019s definitely beginner friendly (my husband had no difficulty helping out) and there are even some things for seasoned cooks as myself to learn. You pretty much end up eating the whole day so you won\u2019t have to eat anything for breakfast, lunch, or supper. Definitely a 5 star activity."

We went on a family trip to Budapest - ages from 77 to 14 years - and I wanted to plan a variety of experiences to keep everybody happy and engaged.Booking the market and cooking experience with Agnes and Andrew was definitely the perfect choice. Seeing granddad chop onions alongside his grandchildren while grandma and I sipped homemade Palinka was a perfect way to spend the day. It was not easy to agree on the menu but we settled for ragout soup, chicken paprikash with noodles and for pudding pancakes with a delicious cottage cheese filling. Agnes made us feel very much at home in her Budapest appartment and Andrew patiently showed us useful tips and tricks which will enhance all our cooking.The market tour was great as well and early enough to beat the rush of the tourists.If you want to give your feet a rest from sightseeing and your brains from all the historical facts - this is a great choice to experience this beautiful city from a different perspective. A winner for all age groups!"

We joined Agnes, our chef, for a tour of the market (trying, unsuccessfully, to limit our snacking along the way), then departed with her to her lovely kitchen. Aprons for all, a sip of local palinka, and the instruction and cooking begins! Agnes is a delight - as was her beautiful young family, whom we met at the end of the day - and her instruction on Hungarian cuisine is clear, pragmatic and insight-giving. And our class-prepared meal, delicious! Definitely a highlight of our trip."

The market tour gave us a chance to sample a variety of different foods and to shop for the ingredients we used in the cookery class. The cookery class itself was good. The instruction was good, and we enjoyed it. This course is on the more expensive end of cookery courses we have done, and takes place in a home environment. Our only criticism would be it was a bit expensive for what it was."

I had already made a quick visit to the market for lunch from one of the food stalls a couple of days earlier, but we ate our way through several different items that I would not have ordered because they were unfamiliar, and I liked all of them. It was also interesting to tour the market (one of my favorite things to do when traveling anyway) and have unfamiliar items identified for me.The cooking class was excellent. Andrew steered me toward recipes he thought I could reproduce with ingredients available in the US. We made sausage and potato soup (my favorite of the three), stuffed cabbage rolls, and poppyseed bread pudding. The class involved a good mix of observing and doing, and then the recipes were emailed to me afterwards.I think this day was the best one of my trip."

            "review": "Making A famous Bean Soup in Budapest. We had a wonderful culinary Hungary Home Cooking experience in Budapest with Andrew. Agnes, the business owner, was traveling so our chef instructor was Andrew. He is a professional sous chef and has worked extensively in the US so he speaks perfect English, understands how Americans usually approach cooking and life in general, and is a patient guy with a passion for good food. It was especially fun to learn that he had managed a restaurant kitchen and club in New Jersey, near where our son lives now. What a small world.A quick summary of my recommendations, in case you don't want to read all the details that follow:- Talk to Agnes about your menu beforehand, to make sure you get the kind of experience you want. Gulas soup and chicken paprikash are not your only options.- Come seriously hungry as the day is filled with more good food than most human beings can eat. Skip breakfast before coming to the market.- Take a camera to capture what the food looks like at various stages and consider taking some notes as well, as there are some critical details in handling some things that are hard to get from a recipe. The details are important.- Come in a small group - 2 or 3 people maybe. They can handle larger groups but that kitchen was perfectly sized for 2 or 3 and more might be crowded.Details:The day began with a meeting at the main city market just off the Danube on the Pest side. We shopped for the ingredients for the meal and Andrew gave us a tour of the snack opportunities in the market for breakfast. It was really a huge amount of food and we couldn't eat all of it, so skip breakfast on the morning of your market visit. In fact, consider fasting for about 2 days before the day, just to give yourself enough appetite for everything you will encounter to eat. :)The teaching kitchen itself is in an apartment well up on the Buda side but the taxi ride was pretty quick (By Budapest standards - traffic is never light). We got there just in time for some tea and a shot of homemade Palinka (How you say \"moonshine\" in Hungarian, but actually what the French would call an eau de vie - fruit brandy.) It was good and warming and then we started cooking.We had already been living in Hungary for 3 months so we asked to learn more complex dishes beyond gyulas soup and chicken paprikash. If you are not sure about what you want to cook, I suggest chatting with Agnes first as there are a number of choices. We wanted some dishes that we had tried to cook ourselves already but were sure we did not get right. That proved correct as what we cooked with Andrew was much better than anything we had managed on our own. The difference seemed to be in both the selection of ingredients and in some specific techniques in cooking.There was plenty of hands on experience and good wine to drink as we went along. Hungarian food is tremendously wine friendly so enjoy it with a glass of something good. Cooking Hungarian food is also wine friendly so have two glasses.When you are finished, at about 3 PM, you will need to get down the hill and back to wherever you are staying in Budapest. They can certainly help you get a taxi or offer some ideas on public transport . There is a metro stop about 15 minutes walk down hill (Under construction at the moment but still operating) or you can walk a little more down to the Danube and have other choices. After that meal, a walk might feel good (it did to us).For dinner that evening, plan a light salad."

After emailing Agnes, I received a prompt response and we set the class in motion. Agnes met me and two friends at the designated meeting spot for a tour of the market and to purchase our supplies for the class. As a special treat, she provided MANY taste treats along the way while shopping. (pay attention when she says have a light breakfast!) At the end of our market excursion, she called a cab and we were promptly whisked away to the Buda side of town for an adventure in culinary excellence. One of the really nice things about her class is that you get to choose the menu in advance, so you know it's something you are interested in and will most probably like. You will prepare and enjoy a 3 course meal that is fun, reasonably easy and delectable. My friends and I chose Bean and Sausage Soup, Stuffed Peppers and Poppyseed bread pudding. All of which were delicious and we can't wait to make ourselves, now that we've returned to the States. Agnes, THANK YOU for being so kind, welcoming and a chef extraordinaire!"

The tour through the market was educational and delicious. I would probably have never tried the dishes that she got 'samples' from the various food vendors. The samples would probably feed 3 or 4 people but we had to save room for our meal that we were going to cook together. Her home is very welcoming and perfect for the event. She is very attentive to the different cooking skill levels and if you need a bit of coaxing there is palinka! I would recommend that if you only have time for one event in Budapest, then spending the day with Agnes is what it should be."

A short taxi ride to Anges' apartment is also a treat as you get to spend some time in Buda that is not part of the tourist area. You'll get a true sense of how the locals live. Unlike the more regimented cooking classes where you are one of 20 or more, this class is small and you never feel intimidated. Thank you Andrew for a memorable day!

Andrew was very instructive and entertaining. My boys learned so much from him!

It was a dreadfully hot day and we were all drenched with sweat but the food was delicious, every part of the tour was worth the cost and I feel like we get to take a piece of Hungary home. Yes of course you can visit a market on your own, but it is nice to have a grand tour and tips from someone friendly and in the know. You can look up recipes on the internet or visit a restaurant but Andrew is a qualified sous chef and he is so helpful and so friendly. The day flew by and it will definitely be a highlight of Budapest for us both. Thanks heaps to both Agnes and Andrew! Ps - the crepes option for mains is absolutely delicious, give it a go!"

She went above and beyond altering our menu to satisfy my vegetarian diet but allowing my husband to enjoy meat dishes too. It was very interesting to visit a local apartment, immerse in the culture and spend a day shopping and cooking, just beware of getting very full!! We would definately do this again, and recommend this tour to any visitors to Budapest!"

We had a short time in Budapest, but read so many wonderful things about the cooking class wee decided it was a \"must do.\" We were not disappointed. Agi and Andrew took us on a wonderful tour of the market and introduced us to many of the items we would be using in the dishes. We noshed on items from the upstairs food vendors and shopped for groceries to complete our meals. This was wonderful because it gave us an opportunity to discuss items that could be substituted for ingredients not available for us at home. Once back at the apartment the fun began. Agi and Andrew were patient in their teaching allowing us to be fully hands on. We talked, laughed, cooked and then enjoyed a fabulous lunch together. Eat light before you meet at the market. If we have the opportunity to return to Budapest we will definitely take another class."

I was born in Budapest but never learned the fine art of cooking Hungarian foods. It was the best morning I have spent, I was instructed with clarity and much humour. English was spoken if required. I learned a lot and enjoyed the fruits of my labour. The food was delicious. Agi even sent me off with a bag of homemade paprika which I now use to impress my friends with my culinary skills. I would definitely go back...if you want the real home cooking experience do not miss this. Thank you Agi and Andrew."

I have just returned from an amazing European trip with my hubby and our best friends and during our time in beautiful Budapest we booked a cooking class with Agi, as I have a small home-based food business in Australia (Canefields Kitchen) and wanted to learn how to cook some Hungarian food from the experts. Agi was on holiday so my friend Ros and I enjoyed a fabulous cooking experience with Agi's co-cook Andrew. It was a wonderful morning and we learnt so much about Hungarian food, culture and lifestyle. The class was held at Agi's apartment, that was easy to get to by the Metro, and was homely and comfortable to work in. The food was simple and delicious and we loved the commentary of Andrew who was a delightful young man with lots of interesting facts and information to share. The food was fun to cook and was very tasty. We also experienced the traditional drink Palinka and some very nice Hungarian wine.Thanks Andrew! we loved the whole experience. Deb & Ros"

My boyfriend and I were traveling to Budapest and were looking for some unique things to do that would give us a little more insight into the culture. the BF is more of a cook than I am and he found this cooking class/tour here on trip advisor. I must admit, I was not thrilled at the prospect since I am a terrible cook so we opted for the tour only. We showed up at the market, which is beautiful and were greeted by Agnes and Andrew. Another traveling couple who were doing the cooking portion also joined and I can honestly say that by about 10 minutes in, I fully regretted that we had not also signed up for the cooking. However, even just the tour was fantastic. Others on here say not to eat beforehand- listen to them!! You will be stuffed full of delicious food by the end of the tour. They took us through all levels of the building, buying foods and explaining them to us while we tasted them (A&A take care of the purchasing, all you have to do is choose when they give you options). My mind swims with the delicious, new things we tried. Agnes even had brought some homemade palinka. It is a bit silly, but I like to try alcohol in different countries that is less available in the US (e.g. Baijiu in China, becherovka in czech republic...) and palinka was on my list, alas my research had also said that most locals know someone who makes it and drink that rather than mass produced stuff. So I was delighted that we got a chance to try something I would have had no other option for as a tourist who knows no one in Hungary (it was quite good!). The food that you taste ranges from salty to sweet, extremely heavy to, well, less heavy but it is always good. My favorite had to be the chocolate cream cheese treat from the dairy part, my bf does not even like sweets but insisted we go back the next day and get some more. There is also a little tourist shopping area on the third floor. Agnes helped me figure out where to find a little clip-on leather coin purse that a friend who had been in budapest a few years before specifically asked me to bring her. Agnes and Andrew also gave us some tips on what to look for in some items when buying them for souvenirs. Other highlights of the market tour included seeing the mushroom sorting station that any local can bring in when they find mushrooms (the workers at the station take out all the poisonous ones, has a large area of models so you can see how to identify them), all of Agnes and Andrew's anecdotes about foods preparation of food, etc. and just getting to tag along as they selected the ingredients for the other couple's chosen meal. We even learned how to identify the different types of paprika and paprika peppers as well as how we might use any given animal part in a meal. Its one of those experiences that really sticks with you. We walked away full, happy with our delightful hosts, excited to venture into the city's restaurants and use our knowledge and overall just happy to have broadened what we know about the world in an interesting way. Next time I'm in budapest, I would do it again, but this time I would do the cooking too."

Arranging the class was painless and Agi was always happy to answer any questions. The directions to the class location were accurate and easy to follow. Agi and Andrew were great teachers and had us happily cooking and tasting throughout the morning. We made goulash soup with noodles, chicken paprikash with dumplings and apple cake. All of which turned out great and tasted awesome. Agi emailed the recipes to us after the class, and told us where to buy the paprika she used so we could replicate the dishes at home. Both Agi and Andrew are very personable and made us both feel very welcome. We continued to tour Europe for 3 more weeks and still my son says this cooking class was a highlight of our trip.

For additional cost she will take you on a tour of the Central Market, but we felt this local market was actually more realistic since it's where she shops every day.She explained everything that we were seeing and even treated us to a langos, which is the Hungarian fry bread with sour cream and cheese on top. She also bought us a couple of packets of ground caraway to take home since it's a big ingredient in Hungarian cooking and hard to find in the US. Once back at her flat, she, along with her helper, Andrew, involved us in all the steps and preparation of cooking our meal. She suggested that instead of the Gundel pancake that we had selected to cook, that we make a cottage cheese pancake (Palacsinta) as it was much more normal Hungarian fare. (The Gundel pancake being a specialty of one of the restaurants in Budapest, but not something that is cooked at home in Hungary.) We made Goulash soup, cabbage rolls stuffed with pork, and the pancakes. Agi was very good at making sure that we understood how things were supposed to look and taste as we were preparing them. We would occasionally stop between preparations and have Pahlinka shots and wine while she explained about other aspects of Hungarian cooking that we were not covering in what we were cooking. She and Andrew also shared a good bit about their life in Hungary. Well worth the money and we also took home leftovers and warmed them up for dinner at our B&B. Really cute to have her 2 year old watch us while we cooked. This class was definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Central Europe."

But not to worry Agi met with us on Sunday and she had already done the necessary shopping for our dish choices. Both her and her husband met us that morning in their flat, we had a nice meet and greet, then he had to leave for errands. That's when the cooking began. Agi is VERY well organized. We did all of the chopping and dicing while she explained about the ingredients and history behind the.dishes. She knew about the wines she paired and showed us where they grew. She had suggestion about touring the wine regions and a tour guide lead. We did everything to prepare the 3 dished we choose and by lunch time it was time to enjoy the fruits of our labor.

You will leave with a full tummy and that sense of achievement of having made delicious food for yourself.We made bean soup, followed by stuffed cabbage and for dessert enjoyed making cottage cheese dumplings.It was all pretty easy to make, and Agi broke it down into easy stages. With a shot or two of homemade Palinka (plum brandy), the day passed quickly and we both had a great time."

We learned and sampled the best of Hungary. Wow! The best quote of our family after the day: \" I feel like I understand the country of Hungary more than I would have ever hoped and meeting this family and cooking will be hard to top. \" All six of us agree, If---when---we go back...we will do it again in a Heartbeat. \""

We are both \"foodies,\" so the idea of learning something about the local cuisine by making it appealed. I had done the same thing with my wife in Istanbul several years ago, and in Italy with my whole family a decade back. Every time, it's been a joy, and this was no exception. Agi's a great teacher, but let's you do the real cooking, which takes place in her own apartment on the Buda side of the river. We spent four hours creating bean soup with smoked ham, crepes stuffed with minced chicken and poppy seed bread pudding (but she has a broad menu you can pick three from, so you even get to choose what interests you most!). We chopped and stirred and sipped wine, and learned about the community and history and a nation in transition from a native. There's always more buildings to look at, but if you want to visit a country, it's more than buildings, and I can't recommend anything more than this experience. Wonderful!"

Anybody can tour a museum or a church, but buying food with a personal guide at a giant open market and then taking it back to her apartment and using those ingredients to create an authentic Hungarian meal is a truly unique experience. Agnes was a good instructor - she explained what we were to do, showed us how to do it (e.g. cut the carrots this size) and then let us go at it. It was not only fun, but informative. We learned three new Hungarian dishes and how to make them. Amazingly, Agnes did not use any written recipes - she had it all in her head - skillfully timing the preparation as we moved from making the soup, to cooking the chicken, then preparing and baking the sponge cake, then back to preparing the palacintas and assembling the dessert cake. What satisfaction to sit down to a delicious 3 course meal you have just created! We also met her family: her husband, her little boy and her mom. It was one of our best experiences in Hungary - and there were many, considering the short time we spent there. Thanks, Agnes!"

Agi and her husband were such gracious hosts that we really felt at home. We even got to meet their darling son! We have done a competitor's class in another city, and altho it was good, Agi's class was so much more personal and rewarding. She sent us the recipes (she even got her father's recipe for sauerkraut for us!) and we will soon try them at home. If you enjoy cooking, or just eating, this is not to be missed.

Agnes was so very kind arranging the class; I knew when we met at the Central Market I was in for a fun learning experience! Touring the Central Market was educational and Agnes answered all our questions. We tasted traditional Hungarian foods, got to see their produce, meats, cheeses with all kinds of explanations to know how foods are prepared, consumed, etc. She was kind and allowed my friends to join with us, answering all of our many, many questions!The highlight, of course, was joining Agnes, her husband and son in their home. Agnes was so organized for our class. Starting the class with appetizers and Palinka, of course, we enjoyed Hungarian wine while we prepared our Ragout soup, Chicken Paprikash, traditional Nokedli noodles, which was sooo fun to prepare, a cucumber salad, and apple pie. Agnes also knew my friend, who loves poppy seeds, wanted to taste her poppy seed dessert. Agnes made sure she had ingredients so we could prepare this recipe, also, and bring home a sample for my friend! We took leftovers home for our friend to sample! Agnes left us with a gift of the Nokedli tool so we can prepare the noodles just like she taught us! I can't say enough about this opportunity and experience. I teach cooking classes, myself, at home, and this was amazing to be on the other side of the class. I learned so much, and mostly, was grateful to Agnes and her famiy for opening their home to us!

Agi took us for a snack and talked us through the different street foods and showed us some of the traditional crafts as well. The we headed down to the food, talking us through the ingredients as preparing a few samples too. Then you go back to her lovely apartment on the Buda side (which I think we would miss altogether otherwise). We chose potato and sausage soup, stuffed cabbage and the poppy seed bread pudding.

Got straight to cooking and learnt new onion chopping skills, as well as how useful a pressure cooker can be! We had an amazing time and the food was incredible - we felt so proud to think that food that delicious was simple and easy to make! This is no group class, it is a personal, private session where you basically have a decadent 3 course meal with a local in their home. Aggi was incredibly generous, introducing wines and local spirits, cakes and canapes, so that by the time lunch rolled around we'd already been nibbling and drinking the past few hours! She was incredibly generous sharing stories of what it's like to live her country. Three hours flew by incredibly quickly and my partner and I felt it made a huge difference to our trip to Budapest - we would easily rank it on par with our visit to the Szechenyi spa in terms of \"must do\" in the city!"

Agi lives in a residential area which is not packed with tourists and you get a better sense of the local lifestyle.My husband and I did the cooking class together. He does not cook at home but enjoyed learning about Hungarian cuisine.

So - - don't be afraid to take your non-cooking spouse with you !While the website does a good job of explaining the experience - - the actual experience exceeds expectations in every way. The food is yummy. Agi is fun and her english is easy to understand. The hands on prepartion keeps everyone engaged. Wine with lunch made the meal seem like a party ! Our lunch conversation gave us a sense of what living in Budapest is like. When we returned home, Agi sent the recipes by e-mail and we're ready to try our luck back home !The hardest part for us was deciding in advance which recipes to prepare. We ended up preparing goulash soup, chicken paprikash with nokedli dumplings and somloi galuska for desert. These were perfect choices - - however - - after tasting stuffed cabbage at several Christmas Market stalls we wish we had tired preparing stuffed cabbage as well - - no problem - - Agi sent us the recipe !If we return to Budapest we'll cook with Agi again. Thank you Agi for a special day !!"

Agnes was pleasant and welcoming of our questions about herself, her family, and Hungarian customs and cultures.I enjoyed the simplistic nature of the cooking portion of our day. It was casual, yet attainable. The atmosphere is in their home, so being able to use utensils, pots, and pans that are more commonly familiar allowed us to feel more comfortable in the actual creation of our Hungarian menu. The fact that this experience does not happen in a professional kitchen or resaurant leaves you feeling more confident that these dishes can be made by even the most incompetent of cooks. You leave feeling like you can actually make these dishes in your own home.By the end of the day, the experience left me feeling that I was not a client, but had just finished having lunch with friends. I actually had to remind myself to not help with the dishes! ;)As a tourist, it is difficult to have this kind of experience at any price.

Agnes was waiting for us at the Market, and took us around explaining all the ingredients and asking some of the stall holder all the ridiculously detailed questions I was posing. Finally, our food purchased, and the differences between parsnip and parsley root having been well discussed, we took a taxi back to her house - very near the wonderful Auguszt Cukr\u00e1zda.After some nibbles and a glass of delicious Palinka, we settled down to cook. After an hour and a half, our wives joined us for a meal when we ate with pleasure. The girls - Agnes was joined by Maggie - helped us in some of the basic preparation, like the boring jobs of peeling the onions or washing up, were great fun to be with, knowledgable and friendly. After lunch, we left, well content with having re-planted our roots in hungarian food."

We really enjoyed learning about the Hungarian cuisine and cooking with Agnes who is very professional and friendly.on our arrival we were offered beautiful hors d'ouvres (sliced bread with salami and also with goose lard, scallions and sprinkled with paprika), then we tasted a homemade palinka (a local aperitif, very strong!) and Agnes showed us a book and explained to us a bit about the Hungarian food ethos.The class was very hands-on, we decided to learn goulash soup, chicken paprikash and apple cake. It was very nice to cook in her well-equipped kitchen. Loved the grater she used to make the fresh dumplings and she was very nice to give me one of which I already used back home!We truly enjoyed eating each dish prepared by us on a beautifully set table with Hungarian china. Agnes was very kind in sharing some tips of local restaurants and she sent us an e-mail with the recipes a few days after our class. This was def the best dining experience we had in Budapest!"

She then showed me around the markets explaining different foods/meats. She also gave me things to try along the way, salami, chocolate and strudel (the chocolate bar was amazing, i actually stocked up before i left the Hungary as they were so yummy, i wish they were in Australia!!) Then we went back to her place. Istvan was there waiting with some yummy appetisers and palinka (yum!) for us. I am not a very experienced cook, so Agnes was happy to help and show me how to cut onions and peel the potatos etc. I did this class on my own, and i was a bit nervous before i got there but both Agnes and Istvan made me feel more then welcome, just like we were old friends. I had a wonderful time and the food we cooked was amazing. I have cooked the chicken paprikash a few times since and it tastes fantastic, the real test is in a few weeks when i cook for my hungarian grandma.... im sure it will be up to her standards. The left over food Agnes packed for me to take back to the hotel for my parents, it was so kind of her and they loved it. Also before i got to Budapest, Agnes kept in contact with me and also sent me some handy tips for being in Budapest. I am so thankful for this day spent with Istvan and Agnes. I would highly recommend this experience and when i go back to Budapest i will definatly be going back to learn to cook another meal."

My mum & I contacted Agnes and were impressed with her prompt reply and her answers to all our questions. We chose the bean soup, chicken paprika and Soml\u00f3i galuska. Absolutely no regrets there, everything was amazing.We caught the metro out to Agnes's place. It was a simple trip from the city centre, only took about 10 minutes. The trains were efficient, clean, and came regularly. It was easy to find our way from the train station - the McDonalds was a good landmark to reassure us that we were walking in the right direction.Agnes greeted us, and we immediately felt at home. We had lots of fun preparing the dishes. There was lots to do, and we both learnt new skills. I felt like no time was wasted - Agnes planned the class very well so we always had something to do, while another part of the meal was in the oven, for example. I had a lot of fun making the noodle dumplings, and Mum was impressed with the secrets of making the sponges for the Soml\u00f3i galuska.We finished the class with a relaxed lunch, eating all our wonderful food. Each of the three courses was delicious. We shared a bottle of wine, and between main course and dessert Agnes showed us a Hungarian cookery book, and chatted with us about Hungarian culture.I would absolutely recommend this class to visitors to Budapest. We were so glad we did it, and it added another dimension to our European trip - something a little different to the usual bus tours and castle visits."

Thankfully, she was able to accommodate me and the day started at Budapest's main market (not to be missed either). We toured the market, sampling a few delicious items as we wandered. My mouth waters every time I think of the savory strudel I sampled.Agnes helped me to find some good paprika that is now in my kitchen waiting to find its way into my next cooking adventure. The cooking class was, without a doubt, one of the best I have ever taken (and I've taken a few). Agnes is a wonderful cook, very personable, and a patient instructor. Now, I can't wait to try the tarragon soup and chicken paprika in my own kitchen. Thank you Agnes, for a day that I'll always remember fondly."

Our mothers are Hungarian and we were excited to experience the culinary arts of our heritage. From the minute we met Agnus outside the Grand market, we knew we were in for a wonderful time. Agnus took her time with us in the market explaining and showing all the different booths and vendors it had to offer. After all of our purchases were made, including a beautiful embroidered blouse for me, a cab ride to her apartment was next.We entered a warm and gracious home setting and easily felt as if we had know each other for a long time as we sat down for some appetizers and palinka. We met her husband and young son and her cooking partner Maggie. Our aprons were put on and the cooking began. I can't go on enough about how wonderful this experience was for us. Not only did we learn many new techniques for food preparation but learned about life in Hungary. We shared our lives and family background as well and found many common threads. The food was awesome as well.This was the highlight of our trip to Budapest and we highly recommend it to everyone."

This was the portion of the trip I was most looking forward to. Being Hungarian, I was anxious to learn more about the cuisine - more than we had learned while dining in local restaurants. Being that my brother and I really like to cook, I thought it was a great way to spend time with my brother. Walking into Agnes and Istvan's home felt like walking into a home we had visited forever. They not only treated us like guests in their home, but also like family by offering breakfast \"appetizers,\" wine and brandy while making our meal. They shared a bit of the history of their own families, the history of how they decided to start teaching cooking classes and finally, the history of Hungary. In fact, the book they referred to was a book that my brother had debated buying - I'm sure he will after this trip.The level of cooking was spot on. While I am comfortable in the kitchen, there were plenty of new things I learned during the class, especially patience! Everything we cooked during our time together was amazing. In fact, as I'm writing this, I'm cooking the Chicken Paprikash and dumplings we made that amazing day together.I highly recommend this to anyone who loves food and Hungary!"

Agnes and Istvan took the time to explain the proper way to prepare the items and stepped in briefly if we weren\u2019t quite doing it correctly. None of the ingredients had been prepped ahead of time. I enjoyed this since the would not be when I recreated the meal at home. All the while they explained the history and culture of the Hungarian people, including their own families and also the small talk happened very naturally.A few hours into it our partners showed up and the atmosphere remained very relaxing and enjoyable. The food turned out just as I had hoped.I would definitely advise anyone that would like to experience true Hungarian cooking to take the class. It made my last day in Budapest very memorable."

This itself gave the experience a real and personal feel. They had laid out a few canap\u00e9s for us and very kindly offered us a taste of some home brewed palinka. After a brief chat over some local white wine, we were ready to get our hands dirty. I am vegetarian and the menu was planned and agreed accordingly. Both Agnes and Istvan provided clear instructions on what to do and liberally educated us on the culinary traditions in Hungary. While cooking, we weren\u2019t spoon fed but weren\u2019t left on our own as well. The quality of our cooking was very much like \u2018home food\u2019, rather than some fancy concoction of a Michelin restaurant, which is what we expected and desired. And as a parting gesture, the thoughtful couple gave us small gifts to make sure we practiced at home what we had learnt there!!! The whole experience was very personal and relaxing. Almost akin to cooking a Sunday brunch with friends over wine and chatter! I have done cooking classes elsewhere, but nothing as warm and personal as this. I would wholly recommend this class to anyone interested in taking a breather from the usual touristy things in Budapest and gaining some insight into the real Hungarian life."

I was able to write a lot on this as I liked it so much.. the short version is first with more details below that for those who are interested!I am by no means rich, and I did think a lot before booking the course as \u20ac99 is more than I would usually spend. Once I had the experience though I can only stress that actually this price is cheap for the value you get. I got a 90 minute solo guided tour, a taxi through a non-tourist part of town that I wouldn't normally see for about 15 minutes, then I was invited warmly into a Hungarian home, had lunch, offered various Hungarian wines, water and homemade palinka.. lots of different knowledge of Hungarian culture, food and cookery, including a highlight for me which was learning how to make pasta very easily from scratch (flour, water, egg, salt + about ten mins from start to finish!) plus the tool to make the Nokedli pasta at home... Really the whole experience was amazing value when you consider all that and I wholeheartedly recommend it. For me this experience gave me more knowledge on Budapest/Hungary than the rest of the 8 days I spent there put together so if there is one thing you should do whilst visiting this amazing city it is this! Long Version:I chose the \u20ac99 option which included a market tour and then learning how to cook the three course meal of my choice. I attended the class alone and I was a little nervous before meeting Agnes of what to expect - I need not have worried as Agnes was very careful to make sure I was enjoying myself and I really had a great time but also learned a lot too. The day began at 10am at the Grand Central Market, Agnes who is a Hungarian girl in her early thirties was easily recognisable waiting outside the market with two wicker baskets. After introductions she took me on a very interesting tour of the market, interspersing natural conversation with entertaining facts. She was a great guide and it taught me so much more than going around the market myself with a guide book would have done. An hour or so later (time flew so it might have been longer) we took a taxi across the Danube into the hills of Buda where Agnes lives. She has a lovely modern apartment and after settling into the clean apron and slippers provided we proceeded to make a lunch of the traditional welcome snack of goose fat on bread (surprisingly very delicious), followed by yogurt we had bought in the market (some of the best yogurt I have ever tasted as it was freshly made). Agnes also offered me a glass of Hungarian wine and showed me the different wine regions in Hungary on a map when she could see I was interested. This felt like just chatting with a friend but afterwards I realised she had taught me a lot about Hungarian wine! Now we had our energy back we moved on to the cooking, I saw someone had complained in their review below how they had to prepare everything with Agnes (no idea why that would trouble you as that is surely the point of a cookery class but nevermind!)... for me this was the beauty of it and something I found refreshing about Agnes' cooking. Everything we made from scratch, so I knew exactly what was in it. If I didn't like something I could leave it out. During the preparation Agnes made sure I was comfortable and offered me soft drink/wine which is my way of cooking so that was good too!After everything was prepared we had a well deserved sit down whilst we ate the dinner and chatted some more. Again Agnes opened my eyes to Hungarian life in these informal conversations in a way no guide book or tour normally would. The meal had turned out delicious and I felt a sense of achievement and like I had learned a lot about cookery, despite me being a fairly decent cook. As there was food left after our meal Agnes put the Somloi Galushka trifle type cake into a container for me to take back to the hotel and share with my husband later so that was very nice.Agnes also made sure I knew how to get back to my hotel and gave me a map with directions marked on it which worked great. Her apartment is very close to one of the big tram stops and this was my first experience of the tram system so it was good to have a reason to use what was a very efficient tram network. I should also mention that I left my sunglasses on the dinner table and Agnes was kind enough to run after me down the road to return them. After the course Agnes emailed me the written recipes with plenty of instruction and reminders on how to do things. I have since made the Paprika chicken which turned out great but I was most excited to make the pasta again to make sure it wasn't a fluke as it seemed so easy there.. but no it worked great with the tool Agnes gave me and my husband was very impressed ;)All in all this is a first rate experience that anyone with an interest in food/eating/Hungary would enjoy!"

After meeting Agnes at the Central Market, we had a nice time walking around, buying things for our cooking class. When we were finished, we caught a cab to her apartment.Once there, we enjoyed some appetizers and Palinka before starting the cooking! It was a lot of fun, cooking traditional Hungarian dishes - and for us, a wonderful introduction to cooking with Paprika.Time seemed to fly as we chopped, stirred, whipped and fried our way through our menu. Lots of fun! (Ishtan? was the perfect \"sous\" chef - helping out where needed and washing up all the dishes! Agnes is a lucky lady - to have a hubby who can cook and clean!!!) Meanwhile, the cooking and conversation flowed - and we really did feel like friends by the time we left.I'd highly recommend this class - as it really is home cooking - and cooking we look forward to doing when we get back home! We can't wait to show off our new Hungarian cooking skills to our family and friends!"

Beginning with the Central Market Hall where we picked fresh everything (Fruit, meat, vegetables). Homemade Polinka, great food, better stories and a noodle maker. My wife's Grandfather immigrated to the US in 1900 and this was her first trip to Hungary. So many great discussions about traditions, superstitions and culture. So many special touches... including Agnes went off menu to make breakfast dish... eggs and noodles. I have been to Budapest 8 times and I am recommending Agnes to everyone I talk with."

The ingredients were of very average quality while we noticed the better quality in the market wasn't expensive at all.Wine at disposal was a last glass of an open bottle and a very average ros\u00e9. For 100 euro per person you don't chop and chip but find ingredients already prepared.The cooking experience of Agnes is very basic, a bit due to her age, and a bit due to lack of passion for cooking. Agnes though felt our disappointment and proposed to refund us. So we decided to pay 50euro per person and got the rest promptly back.Tell the truth we decided to participate reading the comments on tripadvisor........and beingso expensive we thought it was a high level : to discover it is definitively on a beginners level.Absolutely nothing negative to comment on Agnes : kind and willingly to please and assistand help us to buy the right hungarian sausage. Level and fare should be adapted to the real value, this just cannot be the most expensivething to do in such a lovely city !"

If you want to have a chance to cook typical Hungarian food and meet a wonderful Hungarian couple in their home, consider taking a class with Le Cordon Bleu trained Agnes Barath and Istvan Laposi. Our husbands were as eager to learn some new cooking skills as my friend and I were. Our biggest accomplishment was learning how to flip crepes just like a professional and to make 2 layers of sponge cake in one pan. Each of the 3 courses was paired with a local wine (which appealed to our husbands). There was a lot of talk, & laughing as we prepared our meal. Agnes and Istvan provided instructions and information about their culture and foods while we all participated in the preparation of the 3 dishes. This was the highlight of our trip to Budapest, an experience we will not easily forget.Christy and Linda"

            "review": "Really terrific way to enjoy Hungarian cooking. We just took a Hungarian cooking class today with Agnes, and it was a fantastic experience that I highly recommend to anyone who likes to cook and/or eat!Upon making your reservation, Agnes will offer you a choice of one starter, one entree and a dessert. Check out the selection on her website. Agnes lives in a cozy apartment on the Buda side of town, an easy walk from several tram lines and the Red Line subway station. She had some nice appetizers waiting for us when we arrived, and we sat down to chat for a little bit before we started cooking.What's great about the class is that you are active participants in all phases of the cooking - from prepping the ingredients to cooking the actual meal. Agnes herself has taken some culinary classes and learned how to make Hungarian food from her mother. Her husband, Istvan, is also an avid chef. He wasn't around for our class, though.We really enjoyed the time we spent with Agnes, because it was like learning from a friend. While we were waiting for the food to cook, we had a chance to chat and ask questions about Hungarian life and even got to know Agnes better. She's only been giving these classes since May, but she is so professional and prepared that it seems like she's been doing it for years.We learned a lot of techniques for preparing the food, including tips on when and how to add ingredients so they don't end up lumpy. The food proved to be quite delicious, and Agnes even offered us wine and bread to accompany the meal. She also gave us a shot of homemade palinka - warning, this stuff is potent!All in all, we had a very enjoyable experience, and we'd recommend this to anyone who'd like to learn a little about Hungarian cooking and culture, in a very intimate and hospitable environment."

Next time we are in Budapest, we will definitely go back to make more authentic Hungarian dishes."

            "review": "On a Scale of 1 to 10 ... this is an Eleven! Excellent!!!. We just returned home to Italy from a seven-day visit to Budapest and looking back on this experience, our cooking class with Agnes (\u201cAgi\u201d) was without doubt the highlight of our trip. Not to be missed! Don\u2019t get me wrong, Budapest is a fabulously beautiful city with so many incredible sights to see \u2026 but our day with Agi provided a personal glimpse of life in Budapest that was so touching and heartfelt, it will remain in our memory for the rest of our lives.We first contacted Agi two weeks before our trip to Budapest, based on the excellent reviews here on tripadvisor.com. We initially had no intention of taking a cooking class in Budapest \u2026 but then, why not? She responded promptly to our emails, our date was scheduled, and our main concern \u2026 we are two vegetarians \u2026 was accommodated to everyone\u2019s satisfaction providing us with several menu choices.We elected to take the Market Tour + Cooking Class, which offered the opportunity to tour the huge Budapest indoor market. Agi arrived at the market entrance right on time at 10 AM with two cloth-lined woven baskets to help tote away our provisions. Agi is a very beautiful, bright and energetic young woman (late 20\u2019s/early 30\u2019s), with a warm engaging smile and speaks fluent English. Wives need not worry: Agi is an exceptionally pretty \u201cgirl-next-door\u201d type \u2026 and not a young \u201cva-va-va-boom\u201d Zsa Zsa Gabor. \u263a But thank goodness she's also not the matronly schoolteacher type. \u263a She has a natural and easy manner that makes you feel instantly comfortable and we became good friends quite quickly. Her fianc\u00e9 Istavan was working during the day of our cooking class and so unfortunately we were not able to meet him. But we asked Agi to pass on our message to him that he is a very lucky man to have her in his life! We hope he reads this! \u263aOur vegetarian menu was set as follows: Appetizer \u2013 Cold Fruit Soup, Main Course - Mushroom Paprikosh with Nokedli Dumplings, Dessert - Cheese Dumplings with Sour Cream. After showing us the upper floor of the market hall which is loaded with fine handicrafts, we wandered through the huge produce section on the main floor. What a feast for the eyes! Be sure to bring your camera! Agi knew exactly where to go for each type of produce and it was apparent from her discussions with the local merchants that she has a good rapport with everyone. And I respected her when she moved on from any vendor who wouldn\u2019t let her choose the produce herself. Agi was very receptive to our questions and specific needs. I mentioned to her that in Italy it is impossible to find pickles and she took us to a shop with a wide choice so now my \u201cpickle craving\u201d is fully satisfied. Agi has studied culinary arts extensively and is very well informed. Her approach is to always prepare a meal from scratch \u2026 no processed foods here! \u2026 which is always healthier and tastier.Once all our provisions were purchased, Agi called a taxi and we were whisked away to her apartment on the Buda side of the Danube. Her kitchen is very functional with room for active participation. It is important to point out that Agi\u2019s cooking classes are arranged FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE GROUP ONLY, be it just one, two \u2026 or six people. You are never mixed together with strangers in a larger class setting. This makes for a more personal class, tailored to your needs. It also gives you more opportunity for active participation in preparing the meal. We were soon chopping and dicing and whisking and saut\u00e9ing \u2026 and enjoying every minute of it! For us, one of the highlights of the class was the preparation of the Nokedli Dumplings, which I highly recommend. Using a special grater with wide openings, the fresh pasta (made from flour, water and egg) is grated into boiling water using a special trowel. Tossed together with the fresh mushroom sauce (seasoned with onion, pepper, tomato and sweet paprika) it makes a very impressive meal. Living in Italy, where pasta is king, I must admit that the dumplings prepared in Agi\u2019s class were fabulous! We can\u2019t wait to prepare this dish for our friends in Florence! The other dishes prepared for our meal were also extremely tasty. Beginning with a cold fruit soup (perfect for a hot summer day!) and ending with cheese dumplings seasoned with lemon and topped with sour cream (yummy!). Agi guided us toward what was (for us) a perfect meal.The table was set and then our chance to have lunch to sample our Hungarian creations from Agi\u2019s kitchen. Everything exceeded our expectations. Throughout the meal there was a constant flow of stimulating conversation. Agi is such a kind and gracious host that we were soon discussing a wide range of topics as good friends. She was also available to answer our questions on specific aspects of life in Budapest, and even called her parents to ask suggestions for names of pre-WWII singers (one of my passions) so we could purchase a Hungarian CD.Our visit with Agi ended by 3 PM \u2026 much too soon. It was amazing how quickly the time flew by! True to her word, Agi later sent us the recipes for the meal we had cooked together, freeing us from taking notes during the meal preparation. Agi fully deserves all the praise she has received from other reviewers here on this site. On a scale of 1 to 10, this experience was an Eleven!l! Excellent!!! We heartedly recommend Agi\u2019s Culinary Hungarian Home Cooking Class + Market Tour for visitors coming to Budapest!!! \u263a"

The idea of learning to cook some of the most beloved foods of my family's heritage was really appealing to me. Even more interesting, though, was the opportunity to spend an evening in a Hungarian family home while learning.Agnes and Istvan did not disappoint! From the first timely e-mail responses to our evening together, our family was SO happy with the experience! The warm welcome and easy hospitality we received were delightful - they seemed to anticipate our every need and paced the evening so nicely. Watching our teen-age sons smile and laugh together as they chopped vegetables, made dumplings, and tossed crepes almost brought me to tears! And the food and drink were by far the best we enjoyed during our 4 days in Budapest.We arrived as guests and students, but left 4 hours later feeling like friends who had shared a slice of life and amazing plates of food together. Set aside an evening of your visit to Budapest to spend with Agnes and Istvan - we are SO glad we did!"

I found Agnes through trip advisor about 3 weeks before arriving in Budapest via river cruise and am so glad my girlfriend and I spent it with her. We traded e-mails back and forth a few times discussing timelines and availability, activity options, menu and finally meeting time/place. It was all so easy and not stressful at all (I can't say the same for her-she was booked entirely for the week when we eventually met up and must have been harried with my questions!). After meeting in the Great Market she showed us the shops and stands selling the various fare to tourists and locals alike. We picked up the items needed for our menu and were off to her kitchen! A very well appointed and organized kitchen; she had our menu ready in her head and easily dolled out the tasks to me and my girlfriend. She paused a few times to ask if we wanted to have things measured out or as she knows them: visually, by texture, consistency, and smell. We received the recipes and some pictures she took afterward via e-mail anyway and am glad I didn't see a single index card the whole time! The conversation and wine flowed easily at a comfortable pace...soon enough (though still 4.5 hours later!) We were enjoying soup, then dinner (we chose the chicken paprikas \u2013 Paprik\u00e1s csirke) then desert (the floating island-delicious, easy and someone's favorite!) The entire experience was relaxing, informative and fun. A fantastic way to get away from the usually boring and traditional tourist activities, to see a culture as it is presently but enjoy recipes as they are passed on from generation to generation."

My family's recent trip to Budapest, Hungary was so sweetly enriched by our visit with Agnes and Istvan. They are warm, kind, hospitable, and generous peoople who welcomed our family of five with open arms. Prior to our trip, we learned about Agnes & Istvan through tripadvisor website, and we were very much interested. We sent an email to Agnes, and within a day we received a reply with all the answers to our questions. On our designated day/time, we met Agnes in front of the Central Market. Agnes gave us a tour of the market and we were able to experience in firsthand a small glimpse into the life in Budapest. It was informative and interesting to see/smell the local flavors - from ever present paprikas to variety of sausages, organic vegetables to homemade cheeses, local crafts to fine porcelain china, ... We also shopped for the ingredients for our cooking at the market.After the market tour, Agnes took my family in a taxi to her home where Istvan was waiting for us. For the next three hours or so, Agnes and Istvan were wonderful hosts/teachers. They were very patient with my children, explaning and demonstating step by step how to prepare vegetables to how to flip a perfect pancake. We really did ALL the cooking ourselves! We had a wonderful soup, a main chicken dish, and a dessert pancake - all very authentic Hungarian dishes. The entire meal was very delicious and satisfying. But the best part of it all was that we all laughed alot.... It was so much fun! - cooking, talking, chopping, stirring - Sharing a meal together with strangers (now friends) from the other side of the world...All three of my children (ages 17, 15, & 12) LOVED the experience! And my husband and I very much enjoyed our time together with our new friends in Hungary. Thank you, Agnes & Istvan, for your wonderful hospitality!!!

It felt less like a class and more like friends cooking together and chatting about our different cultures \u2013 curiosity on both sides. For desert we made amazing cottage-cheese-lemon-breaded-dumplings, which were fantastic. Istvan joined us for lunch and we all enjoyed a tasty meal, wine, and good company. Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t stay as long as we would have loved to since we had a guided tour to catch, but before we left, Agnes dished up our leftovers so we could enjoy round two of deliciousness later that evening on the banks of the Danube.

It is not only a wonderful introduction to the cuisine and culture, but also a great way to connect with a local. The Central Market where we bought the ingredients was the initial introduction to the food. You can do this on your own (we went back another day and had some terrific langos that\u2019s sold on the upper level) but having someone who knows where things are and what to look for is a great help. The class was relaxed and well arranged, with plenty of time to cook, drink wine and palinka, talk, interact and take pictures. Agnes is a charming hostess. Afterwards we all sat down and ate the authentic Hungarian dishes we made. The delicious food gave us a great feeling of accomplishment!Agnes and her friend Maggie were very willing to discuss all manner of things of life in Budapest. This type of interaction is something that a typical traveler does not have, and gives you an insight into the country and the people. The day after we came home we tried the recipes; of course they didn\u2019t come out as well as the first time, but with practice we know they will improve. Overall, a memorable experience that we highly recommend."

First we were off to the local market to buy the groceries for the cooking lesson from local producers and then we headed for her apartment and the cooking experience.The cooking lesson was very well prepared, with easy to follow recepies, good tools. During the class we had time for cooking, tasting wines and learning about Hugarian cooking, culture and life in general. Agnes and Istvan were both very friendly and helpful and easy going. Do take the opportunity to ask Agnes and Istvan about anything you would like to know about cooking, Budapest and life in Hungary. All in all the cooking lesson was an amazing experience and a very memorable occassion and I'd warmly recommend it to people who like cooking, but also to people who would like to get under the skin of Budapest."

We were unsure what to expect from the Labyrinth, and while entering the chill cave I hoped for something more than what we actually found. The opera costumes on old mannequins were nice with the opera music on background and few fans moving the curtains, but after few of the scenes it got really boring. Almost all of the rooms in the cave had some rocks or pieces of old buildings in them. If one is really keen on history these might be of interest, for us they were just boring peaces of stone. The dracula exhibition was mostly posters on walls about Dracula, few of the rooms were full of mist and well illuminated and had really spooky feeling in them. I enjoyed those rooms.Best part of the cave was the completely dark path one could go through. We took each others hands and slowly walked through the path feeling the walls and occasionally searching a helping rope from the wall. The experience was partly ruined by other tourists, who walked the completely black cave with lamps on. Also there were EXIT-signs, which were illuminated by the lamps for a long period of time giving away the correct way to go too easily.We were confused about the cave after we left. There didn't seem to be any connection between the separate parts and overall it was too expensive for what it was worth."

But if you took me to the opera i'm sure i would appreciate the art form. This however was not the opera, this was mannequins dressed as if they were in an Opera while music blared over speakers. The most creepiest thing may be the fact that they were in what looked like jail cells. Was this to protect the mannequins from visitors of the other way round? If you've ever seen an episode of Doctor Who or a scary movie you will understand what I mean when I say 'Don't Blink!'. I took pictures so I could try and explain this to people afterwards but my fear of looking back at the pictures at a later date and discovering the mannequins have disappeared from them and are now haunting my house was too great and I only got in about two pictures before making a break for it. There were sections of the labyrinth that were pitch black, this was interesting as it took quite a while to get though, this wasn't helped by the Well situated about halfway through that took out a large chunk of everyone's shins. After about 20 minutes we left the night of the living mannequins and came across the Dracula exhibit. This was probably even odder as they filled the caves so much with fog that we couldn't actually read any of the text on the walls about his life without the torch i had on my car keys. One thinks the operator of the Fog machine was having an argument with management as there was such a heavy fog we couldn't see where we were going or what we were looking at. They lead you to believe Dracula was either buried here or somewhere similar. Doing our own research after the fact we now know that he wasn't buried in a cave at all. I wouldn't be surprised if one of the exhibits descriptions explained about how he opened for Beyonce in 2008 and sung with David Hasselhoff at the Berlin Wall. Where as you may think I would not recommend visiting this \"attraction\", I do! We have never laughed more, screamed at each other in the dark or talked about a day more than this weird afternoon in a cave."

My girlfriend and I went there after 6.30pm to do the lamp light tour, which sounded like quite a fun and unique element. I don't know if them having turned off all the lights led to us not finding any of the exhibits, but we wandered around for half an hour through empty rooms looking at mannequins dressed in old opera props (still have no idea why) and looking at lumps of stone with different stonemasonry techniques on them - still no idea where they were from or why they were there. It's annoying to know that the recent history of the labyrinths - i.e as a shelter in WWII are barely even mentioned, let alone promoted or explained. Basically, in summary, if you want to waste 2500 Florint and an hour of your life this place is ideal. There are significantly better things to do in Budapest - don't bother with this."

The Labyrinth was purely entertainment as a self guided walk though caves with various exhibits including one that featured Verdi's opera A Masked Ball with recorded music (always great in caves, right?) and \"wax substitute\" figures of the characters; another that covered the history of the real Count Dracula (not a vampire, but was supposedly at one point kept prisoner in these caves); and another one that allowed you to walk some distance in full darkness using only a thin string along the wall to find your way (a sign at the entrance encourages you to meditate on what it is like to experience absence of light but unfortunately this experience was somewhat ruined for us by several groups of millennials who either failed to read or ignored the sign and passed through using their cell phone flashlights to break the darkness!). The Hospital in the Rock exhibit provided a nice historical tour on the use of the caves as a medical facility during WWII, during the 1956 uprising, and later as a potential command center in the event of a nuclear war."

No mandatory tour guide rushing you along so you can really enjoy exploring the darkness, viewing the various sections dedicated to eras in which the tunnels were utilized. TIP!!!! Bring along any kind of a small penlight! Or make sure your phone is well charged to provide a light. We spend a full hour and a half exploring all the chambers and tunnels which are still very original! Dripping water everywhere, with some small puddles and lots of darkness. Do this in the middle of the hot day and you'll love the escape into the cool underground chambers. You can walk down the long staircase and look around a little bit with out even having to pay until you actually get into the tunnel system. If your not sure at least make this quick trip down the stair to see if your interested. This is the Buda side activity I'm going to be telling all my friends they need to do!"

Don't go in alone.Anyone who goes in the maze may get goosebumps. It's true.When the maze of darkness is finished you walk many steps and it gets misty..and mistier...and mistier....and then so misty you can't hardly see a thing! Then when you past that part you'll come to a room where there are all these things about Dracula and how his wife died and stuff and then you come to this room with there are there heads on a stone wall and you may get creeped out at that point because the next room has blood under three rotted nails- I'll not tell you why because i don't want to spoil it all. When you finally come to the end you may feel like you want to go in it again but will it feel like it did on the first time you went round?

The dark cave tunnels are probably the most fun bit as you can't see a thing and spend a while trying to work out which way to go. Not good for people who are scared of the dark or of small spaces!There are random waxwork figures in parts of which there was no explanation of why they were there. There are a few plaques to read about Dracula and the labyrinth.It is slightly cold in there so consider wearing a extra layer! Also I wouldn't go wearing sandals or any nice pair of shoes you may own as it is very wet and clay-like in most parts. Just a warning!It would be much better if they made it more interactive and maybe had some live actors in certain parts!

People either seem to love or hate the Labyrinth - and I think the cause is that as an attraction, it is hard to classify.First off, many websites will say it is closed. This is not true any more, it was very much open when I was there. Most days it is open from 10AM-9PM and for an adult, the price is 2500 Ft. though some hotels will give cards for a discount. I went at 6PM and was given a lantern to explore with - the whole labyrinth has little to no lighting of its own, and with the generally low number of entrants, makes the whole place very atmospheric. Inside is a mish-mash of themes and information, from Budapest's history (particularly about King Matthias), to waxwork dioramas of famous operas, examples of masonry and stoneworking, pictures of famous caves around the world..... and most famously, stories about Vlad the Impaler's (Dracula's) relationship with Budapest.The whole cave system is somewhat spooky, with two (optional) sections being particularly tense - the completely black maze of darkness and the foggy Dracula's crypt. If you've played Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll have a vague idea of what to imagine. It's not a horror maze however, so there are no jump scares.For what it's worth, I enjoyed the experience. It's relatively short (~45 mins) but memorable. Don't expect a museum, a historical site or a ghost ride, but a little bit of all three and appreciate it for what it is: unique."

It is promoted as Dracula's prison but actually has a dark and intriguing history. The labyrinth of tunnels has been in existence and used by man/hominids for nearly 300 000 years and was of course used in WW2.In medieval times it was a prison for the infamous Vlad the Impaler from Transylvania. The Dracula connection of the Labyrinth is therefore historical derivation from which the vampire legend is borrowed.The Labyrinth is just 2 minute walk from St Mathias Church and costs 2500 Florints.It takes about 30 minutes to walk through the tunnel which is about 30m deep and is accessed from a steep staircase. The tunnel itself has sufficient light, is flat and a close study of the map shows it is easy to find your way around (if you ignore the little alcoves). There are displays of Verdi's the Masked Ball close to the main entrance and I have been told that some performances take place in these tunnels.The first of two eerie sections is an unlit 'maze'. It was so dark I could not see my feet but with the help of my wife's phone we walked through it and I did not bump my head on the ceiling (Some sections are slightly under 6 feet high)The second exciting section was filled with smoke from dry ice and led to 'Dracula's tomb'. The music here was that of a church organ with a suitable crescendo as we approached the tomb. I would strongly advise that you do not visit this part of the tunnels, or indeed the whole Labyrinth, alone."

The maze of darkness section is quite amusing as you walk through an unlit section of the caves following a rope attached to the wall, but slightly dangerous due to the pitch black and damp, sticky conditions. It is, as the name would suggest, a labyrinth and the worst thing is the lack of provision for those who might panic in the corridors and want to get out - there are no members of staff inside and we only saw one map during our visit. Every corner looks the same and with no emergency exits you really do have to keep going until you happen to see the way out. Definitely not recommended for sensitive children or the claustrophobic."

The attraction includes the \"Medival Stonework\", \"the Masked Ball of the Black Count\" (wax dolls from an opera), \"Dracula's Chamber\", \"Marvellous Caves\" (introduction of other caves all over the world by panels) & \"Ghost Labyrinth\" but we couldn't find the Ghost bids.For the Dracula's Chamber, I expected many more wax dolls would be there to demonstrate his brutal history but what they had were basically explanation panels (the panels themselves were interesting but we wanted more of thrills.)To be fair, the labyrinth itself is a natural creature not artificial and it was where the Dracula was imprisoned so it is a historically important place, but the place could have been better on the whole.Cannot be really recommended."

Although there were several parts of the caves that were a little on the kitschy side - wax figures playing 18th Century music (which I didn't really understand the purpose of) - the Dracula portions of the caves were really spooky.

One card per person.This is near the fisherman's bastion hidden away. You walk down several deep steps into the start of the chamber, no signage thus far, you can walk around this chamber for free before you have to pay entry fee.The labyrinth is a large circle that takes about 40 mins to get around if you read every plaque. It's cool/damp throughout with some areas having mild fog.It's strange at points as there's wax dummies reenacting parties or daily life with opera music in the background but no explanation as to why they were there. Did they party in the caves? Who knows.Later on, you'll start reading about Dracula and I think his grave is in one of the chambers, again, it's unclear and strange. Throughout is random pieces of rock of which I assume are old artefacts found in the cave. Eg, a windowsill. In one section you can experience what it was like in 'no electricity' times and walk through a dark maze. It's pitch black but they have a rope (wet hosepipe) attached to the wall to guide you. There's a lot of low ceilings, dim lighting and uneven and wet flooring in here with little warning. At some points, there was fog? Which was difficult to see through or where to safely walk.It's a bizarre experience but its a cave nonetheless and has historical elements, you just need to find them out beforehand.No WiFi (obviously) but toilets available."

Not in the main ones, rather hidden, but there are some signs to show you the way. To get to the caisse you have to go down a lot of steps, from street level to a deep cellar. Make sure you have cash in your vallet, since they do not accept cards. Entry fee is 2500 HUF for adults, but they offer discounts for children, teachers, pensioners, groups and they also accept some coupons (Hop-on-hop-off, Minicard). Guides are not provided, but there are signs, maps and plaques to help you. The place houses several exhibitions, most of them are really only for effect. The inprisonment of Dracula to this very cave is an extremely interesting historic event, however, it is shown as a lame vampire story. The waxworks in costumes are just rottening puppets instead of characters from Verdi's A Masked Ball (no suprise they are rottening, humidity is pretty high there). The Caves of the World exhibition means nothing more but a couple of photos. The Labyrinth of the Darkness where \"you may encounter yourself\" is a simple corridor without lights. The medieval carved stones are interesting but something is missing. There was a room where old movies were shown but without explanatory notes... It was very disappointing for me, but I am a grown-up person with expectations. I wouldn't really recommend this place unless 1. it is heavily raining outside and you are right at the entrance 2. you have to babysit for 10-15 small kids. In this latter case, take the advantage of that the place organizes games where spiders, wizard hats, skulls etc.have to be found among the exhibits. Kids like stuff like this."

Immediately a man came out and rudely ordered me to delete the photo and let him watch me do it. He reacted as if I had lifted something from the desk. I apologised, showed him the photo, then seemingly out of nowhere there was a second man behind me closing me in, offering to \"delete it for (me)\" I had to explain i had already done it for his colleague. I said i hadn't seen a no photos sign, however i noticed one on the way out which had no explanation of the following rule: they said I could obviously take photos inside, but obviously couldn't take one of the ticket desk.

So you go down some stairs and down some more stairs and then down some more, finally you reach the entrance. There is a map of the caves and lots of information about the history of the caves. There is an option to follow through an unlit area of the caves, with a guide rope to see you through, however after a few steps in, just far enough to find the rope, I was too scared to go any further and we used the detour. You aren't obliged to go through the unlit section.We followed the arrows and came to the section with the history of Dracula. This was really interesting but you're then directed through a dead end series of ever decreasing arches with ever decreasing light, with some very tense mood music! I declined and sent my husband on ahead, I'm really not one for scary films and the atmosphere in here is fantastic in that it really draws you in. Once my husband had been to check it all out I followed him down to the end of the tunnel and saw for myself what was on display. Back up to the main tunnel and I was able to laugh and agree that it was indeed good fun.Back on the main tunnel pathway and then you're directed through what seems to be another dead end, the path is descending and the ceiling even more so and suddenly the floor is also wet. Again I didn't want to proceed so waited for my husband to check it out first. He came back and assured me that there was indeed a way through. At this point though, we were the only visitors, there were no more of the odd tableaux to distract us and I really started to feel the oppression of the meters of rock and buildings above us. I forced myself ahead.Almost full circle and there is a display about caves elsewhere in the world, be sure and read the one about South Africa!This was a great experience. I didn't like the mannequins, but the lighting and music deliver great tension in just the right places, it was a bit scary without being terrifying, but good fun. You'll need to put on a brave face if you take children with you though!There are toilets towards the end of the cave route."

You have to persevere through some creepy models dressed in old style clothes in scenes from some sort of opera but then there is a really fun and quite scary DARK MAZE. And at first I assumed this would only be scary for young children but boy it was scary for us adults. You have to find your way in pitch black thorugh parts of the cave and it seems to go on forever. Don't cheat and use a torch also ruins it for those who are already searching through the maze. At points there was a rope on the wall but the best way is to have your arms out ready to stop you walking into things. Once you exit the maze you feel an amazing sense of achievement. Then you get lots of information on the tales of Dracula and see his tomb. And you end with information on caves around the world which I have added to the Bucket list."

We were completely devistated and were unable to get out of bed for the rest of the duration of our trip. Completely ruined Budapest for us."

I gave them a miss, thinking the historical bit would be just round the corner.It never arrived.There is a short area where you are invited to go through in pitch black with just a hand rail to guide you. That was fun. We didn't cheat and went round without turning on phones for a light source.

The connection with the historical Vlad the Impaler intrigued us, so we set off one afternoon to visit. The entrance is accessed by several long, very steep flights of stairs. To my knowledge, this was the only way in and out, making it difficult for small children or those with physical limitations to access.After debating and hesitation, we opted to pay the (rather high) fee and began wandering around. Their was Phantom-esque music playing, and the first few rooms were filled with characters from the Opera which was based on this infamous prison. (The name of the opera escapes me.) That part was a bit cheesy. Further on, things got eerier and quieter, (we were the only visitors at that time), and in one section, you had the option of advancing in total darkness through several rooms, guided only by a hand rail! (We opted to pull out our cellphone flashlights.) It was rather terrifying. Rooms further on were shrouded in (manmade) fog, with creepy music playing and some Dracula type decorations about.All in all, we enjoyed ourselves, and found it to be a bit more scary than anticipated. This makes for a good cold weather/rainy day activity. If you have people easily scared in your group, they may not enjoy it, nor would children, I think. Read up on the history beforehand, if you go. The informative signs were rather limited on the specifics about Vlad the Impaler."

Then some staff appeared and hand over lamps, and hastily tried to go ahead of us and look for the switches of the lights with a torchlight in his hand.

Just about everything you could hope for in one experience.The Labirintus is very old and has been used for everything from storage to shelter to dungeons. The adaptation over time of what was a natural cave system into an interlocking series of rooms and tunnels is fascinating.There is one lengthy winding section that has no lighting and you are encouraged to go through using only a rope tied to one wall as your guide. It's impossible to describe how dark it was being underground with no lighting. This was both terrifying and exhilarating. We talked about it for quite some time afterwards.There is some history here about the real Vlad the Impaler being imprisoned in the caves at one point, and this has been cheesed up with some corny fake heads on sticks, a false tomb and some eerie figures down passage ways.The less said about the mannequin displays the better.An enjoyable way to spend some time if you bring the right attitude along."

It's history as a natural cave formation, prison, military hospital, wine cellar, and harem is perhaps inadequate to pique interest, so the story of Dracula (a 12 year inhabitant of the prison) is used as a primary draw. Further, the initial part of the complex is piped with opera music and many chambers feature costumed figures with 19th century costumes. i never got the explanation for why... One chamber looked to be inhabited by aliens, another by holographic ghosts. Also...why? The story of Dracula takes over (covering myths vs. what is actually known) as he was a long term resident. At last we start to learn more about the history and geology of the complex. It ends with a photographic tour of other noteworthy caves around the world you might want to visit. We had a young child in our party that was scared by the music (pretty haunting in places) and the darkness."

Undergound caves were life savers during wars (WW II comes to mind) and Germans often hid in such subterranean places. And this is a big one.The \"tour\" costs 2000 HUF per person (not a lot at any rate) and it will give the heat weary a nice quiet dark respite from outside and above. So here's the scoop: (1) it is Dracula-themed in places, (2) Verde Opera and lavish costumes on wax figurines occupy many of the \"cells\", and (3) there are 15th century masonry pieces on display. It is dark down here! Some areas are traversed in total darkness, save for the slightly sticky and gummy railing (hello, hand held sanitizer!) and there is a possibility for getting lost. At the end of the tour, you come to find out they do have monitors to check the area. Well, let us all hope they actually watch those.My impression: it is much cooler than upstairs in the sun, it is much darker, it is damp, there is the potential to get lost (as we did, from time to time), and it is a nice afternoon diversion.There won't be any brochures to take home and, as the cashier says, \"everything is printed inside\" and indeed it is. There is enough lighting to read (although dim). At some point in time (in the final analysis), Count Dracula was imprisoned down here and, while imprisoned, his wife commited suicide. I guess someone loved him. To our absolute delight, we did find our way (unaided, thankfully) up and out of the maze. It really is big. Historically, these caves go back a very long ways to pre-civilized times. It was a nice break, read about Vlad and then go see a recreation of the Verde Opera (music included) ad then go see relics of ancient stone cutters tools. Did I mention that this is a major underground cave? Like in stone, dripping, dark walls? Yup. But no creatures scurrying about. The sign says no photos but we did not see that until we exited the maze so I guess my photos are the first you will see? I'll bet not. And did I mention how awfully hot it was up there, outside? Humid up there, too. This refuge was well worth the price just for the relief."

You find some very interesting information about Dracula who groow up here and that part is made a bit scary with smoky bits.The place doesn't have any fire/emergency exit as it is a real dungeon.

After our previous attempt in October 2014 when it was closed indeed, this time we found it open. We walked down the steep and long steps deep under the castle hill and paid the entrance fee of 2000 forint each (approx. 7 Eur). This was my second visit, but still like it and find it amazing, even though some areas were closed off and didn't find the wine fountain.

The \"total darkness\" challenge where you follow a \"rope\" around also has good potential to scare each other.A lot of laughs were had."

By the time we manage to find the exit (not an easy task) there was'nt a single person at the entrance, we were left with the two flame lamps, all alone, and after going up the stairs, we have found a closed door. After we opened the door, to show our selfs the way out, a member of the staff appears from another closed door, insulting us, and after to trying to talk with this large man (I really thought he was joking) the insults just kept on going until he slammed the door in my face.Keep in mind that at this time there were (at least) one couple of tourists inside the \"Labirintus\" maze that we came across a few minutes earlier.Places like this should not exist, they just just give a terrible image of a such a beautiful country as Budapest.I'm more than welling to discuss this experience with someone in charge at \"Labirintus\" (feel free to email me at nqhorta@gmail.com) and not only to try my money back.Avoid at all cost."

It's several rooms- it takes a good few minutes (it felt like 5 min to me, but again, I was scared). It's pitch dark and you follow a rope fixed to the wall. It's away fro the other rooms so it gets very quiet. The rooms had ventilation so you might feel a breez at the back of your neck.

Opera music was playing in the caves, with scenes from operas depicted by mannequins in various locations. I don't really understand why or what relevance this had. There was a large and rather silly section about dracula, in which a smoke machine had been used. Unfortunately with nowhere for the 'smoke' to escape, this made it an unpleasant environment to breathe in.The maze in the dark was quite fun and worth doing. It was also interesting to see stone artefacts around the caves - I would have liked to see more of this and learned about how the caves were used during history. The caves of the world section was also interesting.If you're after a scary experience this is one to do - you can even visit guided by an oil lamp after 6pm.

I have no idea if there is any truth to their claim that Dracula was actually imprisoned there, but the cave complex is fun to walk around in, and its extra fun to imagine that he might have been a prisoner there. The pumped in mist and colored lights adds a little cheese factor, but so be it. A few artifacts are scattered around, along with some nearly pitch black sections (which you can skip if darkness is not your thing).Although there is a long flight of stairs to get down to it (if you are coming from the castle complex) once down the cave itself is stroller friendly, mostly flat with a few low ramps."

That made it extra creepy! You should go when lots of people are there. The highlight is the fact that Vlad the Impaler (Dracula) was kept there for a time. They really spook that area up. It's also cool to just walk through these underground areas. It is located in the Castle Hill area and is something you could do if you are up there. It took me about 20 minutes to see the whole thing.I'm a teacher too and I got a discount ticket. Bring your ID teachers!"

There is the option to go though the cave of darkness but I opted for the lit arrowed pathway! I imagine it is a bit of fun to do it in the dark but I scare far too easily! There is an expedition on Dracula down there which adds to the creepy vibe. English language plaques on the wall give lots of information about Dracula and his imprisonment in the caves. Interesting way to spend an hour."

It had to be the single strangest experience of our entire 2 week trip around Europe. It was a total hodgepodge of things. When you first go down, there are wax figures in fancy outfits and opera music playing. Although there was some signage trying to explain what was happening, it was really unclear what the purpose of having this down there was. Then you go through this \"tunnel of darkness\" where it's pitch black and you hold onto a rope to find your way through. Despite a sign basically saying \"go at your own risk\" and \"you may meet yourself in the darkness, never return, etc,\" there were no scary surprises along the way. There is also some info and legends regarding Dracula (accompanied by creepy music of children going \"lalalalala\" and some heads on stakes). Then there is random architectural and archaeological info (lots of rock like objects). Although the labyrinth rooms and walking through itself is neat, I would have appreciated some more history (i.e. a more informative, less bizarre experience). Overall, very strange but at least we got a lot of laughs out of it!"

Somehow the folks at my hostel recommended it and I thought it was perfect for a rainy afternoon. But the experience was nothing like I had imagined. One, I was actually 50 metres under the city and spent 3.5 out of 4 hours on my fours! Two, I met some fabulous bunch of people who by the end of it had created a weird connection. Listening to your guide is very crucial, and make sure you stick with the group. The caves are not the usual limestone caves and hence very rustic and dusty. While they give you a jumpsuit and helmet to wear, make sure you reach for this one in strong sports shoes. Must do bucket list activity for the adventure seekers!"

Now all of these things are great but it can get a bit repetitive and you might be looking for something to break it up. Well let me introduce to you to caving!! The trip involves a 2-3 hour excursion deep underground where you get to explore the depths of some ridiculously interesting caves. One of their awesome guides will direct you though the winding maze where you will squeeze through body sized gaps or enter large open rooms. It's a lot of fun, it's active and it's a little different. I also met an amazing bunch of people who were in my tour group. My only negative is that they do not provide transport to the site. You have to take 2 buses and then walk 5 mins. I wouldn't have minded paying slightly more to have a mini bus take us up to the site. Anyway if you have a spare half day in Budapest I would 100% recommend this!"

They provide most of the gear you need, but do double check and pack sensibly. Most of the caving is fairly suitable for beginners, but people with claustrophobia should beware because there is one spot where the tunnel is very very narrow and you have to wriggle on your belly for about 20 meters. People with height phobia should also note that right at the start you have to climb down a pretty high ladder"

So that really can happen if you have wide shoulders or hips but not to worry, the guide gave very good verbal instructions and kept us calm and with a little bit of pushing he was free and able to laugh at the absurdess of getting stuck underneath so and so much stone. Please, if you are ever in Budapest, try this experience! You might even want to make a detour for this, it was maybe one of my best travel experiences ever.

Our guide was a nice lady named Edith that met us at the Nyugati station at the bus stop with bus number 26 and 126 (might be a little harder to find if you are not familiar with the area. Its beside the West End mall and beside a carpark) Had to get either a bus day pass or 4 single trip tickets because we had to take a bus to the outlying areas of Buda. You need to get this independently and will likely not be provided by the tour company. Took about 45-60 mins to get to the destination. Coveralls and helmets with lights are provided and are REALLY important, so get one that fits well and works. [For those that don't know, caves are really dark really silent places] Edith was a great guide, constantly counting heads and making jokes with us. We all felt safe with her as she knew the routes well and chose the route that was most suitable for our group. I.e. she picked a route that was exciting and challenging for us but not ones that were too tight and might have caused us to get stuck. It really was a wondrous experience for us caving virgins. Admittedly it was not a spectacular cave like the mammoth cave or the cave with crystals in mexico, but for a new person, this was well suited for us. 2.5 hours of trekking 50m under the ground was awesome. Its cold underground, about 10-14 degrees, but don't wear thick clothes. the exertion and the coveralls are enough to get me sweating even though I was wearing T-shirt and shorts. A warning, the caves are not for the claustrophobic or those that are highly averse to dust or mud, or those with weak ankles. It is dusty in the dry parts of the cave and muddy and slippery in the wet areas, and generally uneven flooring all around. Wear a reasonable pair of shoes with good soles that you are willing to get dirty. I made the mistake of using a dirty worn old pair of sneakers and it felt like i was ice skating on the slippery parts haha. I would definitely recommend this for those that are new to caving and are looking for some excitement in Budapest. :)"

No. If you're a relatively active person, you shouldn't have a problem. If you're scared of tight spaces and of being underground, probably not for you.

I would recommend taking decent shoes, but I managed in trainers. They provide you with a helmet and an overall to wear.

I didn't book this through trip advisor but with the company direct by googling it (saved myself \u00a310pp).I am claustrophobic and I have to admit I nearly cried a few times! However such an AMAZING experience I cannot explain enough! The gaps are very small and tight but I managed it with some guts. Small groups - around 10 people- our tour guide was brilliant! knew so much about the caves and history, was good at giving pointers about how to get through narrow gaps and also had a sense of humour too. I wouldn't advise going if you are hugely overweight as it will be tight for you however depends how daring you are.Not for the weak or non adventurous, also wear decent shoes- preferably walking boots!"

            "review": "Awesome, but not for the feint of heart!. We booked through gotohungary.com, and had the choice between a walking tour of the caves and a \"more active\" tour. We chose the more active tour. Age limit was 55...we are 52, so figured it would be an easy tourist-like experience. Nope - full-on caving. Our guide, Laszlo, was really awesome - took his time explaining about the caves, taking breaks to help us catch our breath and helping when we were having trouble getting through a tight spot. First descending by ladder 15 meters, then several minutes down-sloping meters of pretty easy rock navigation in wide tunnels/caves. I am not claustrophobic per se, but it is a bit unnerving to think about being closed in so far beneath the surface. Then we had some serious squeezing and tight places. At one point my boyfriend felt stuck and had some anxiety but Laszlo was quick to help. When it was all done we felt like we had really accomplished something. One note - they give you a coverall, but if it is muddy (it was) your cuffs and sleeves will get dirty. They didn't have shoes or Wellies, so our shoes were very dirty but cleaned up ok at home. Overall awesome experience, but as I said not for the feint of heart."

They were so helpful in the cave, always making sure you were able to do as much as you wanted, and made it so much fun. We sat around in a cave for a while and our guide had us all turn out lights out so we could experience absolute darkness. She then asked if anyone could sing, and when no one volunteered, she proceeded to sing the most beautiful song in Hungarian, and the acoustics in the cave were breathtaking. Once out, they offered to ring a taxi for us also. Great experience."

Squeezing through impossibly tight spaces and crawling through tiny tunnels - we had a blast.At the beginning of the tour, you are given overalls, which is great, because you can move freely without worrying about your clothes (nonetheless, I wouldn't wear the best clothes, because there is still a chance of them getting slightly dirty). The cave itself is covered in clay, making it safe to crawl and climb everywhere (I have cut my hands pretty badly in other caves...). Also, there are different options for your tour. Depending on the group, the guide can choose a different route tailored perfectly to the individual requirements (done while on the tour), meaning you could repeat the tour several times without taking the same route twice :)Tip: Bring some hand lotion for afterwards, because your hands will need hydration :)"

The first one is a walk through a small section of the cave. The second (the one I did) is a true spelunking experience. It's not easy and you shouldn't expect it to be easy. There is more crawling than walking. You do have to squeeze through some tight spaces. You will probably get a bruise or two from bumping into rocks. However, it is definitely worth it! And, anyone who wants to do it can do it! The only limitations are that you have to be able to handle a couple hours of walking/ crawling. It is an amazing experience! I would highly recommend this caving experience to everyone who wants a little adventure in Budapest!"

I'm pretty small, but I never got stuck or worried about getting stuck. There are some very tight spaces though. Aditte, our guide, was fantastic and very knowledgeable. We had a small group of only 4 so we were able to move through pretty quickly. It was 50 degrees Fahrenheit that day, which is about what it is in the cave, but we got very hot in the suits they give you.

It was actually more strenuous than I anticipated and I'm a very outdoors/fitness type. I could definitely feel it the next day and had a few minor bumps and bruises. It was totally worth it. Some of the passage spaces were quite small, narrow, or tight fitting. Our guide was great and I learned a lot on the tour. So it was educational, endurance testing, unique, and memorable all at the same time....simply spectacular. A few tips: If you are taking public transportation you eventually need to catch the bus at Kolosy Square. In late Sept 2015 there is a road construction project there, so allow a few extra minutes to navigate that area and be aware of the possibilities of some disruptions in the normal flow of traffic. Secondly, they only accept cash. Thirdly, wear shoes with tread. Hiking type boots are best. Finally, you really do need to be in at least decent shape for the 2.5-3 hr. geological tour. There are ample rest periods, but you've got be able to climb, slide, and crawl a fair amount. I don't say that to dissuade anyone, but if you are mostly sedentary the lack of stamina may make the longer tour very challenging for you. With those caveats and suggestions, I'd say do it! You'll be glad you did!"

If you think you will enjoy it then I 100% recommended it. For me it was a once in a lifetime experience and I am very glad I did it. I would say that I was close to my physical limits by the end of the two and a half hours and the next day I ached all over! It was worth it as the experience was fantastic. We were provided all the equipment we needed but we did take our own walking boots and I would recommend using walking boots not trainers. Our guide was funny, experienced, informative and confident with his job, he gave me confidence to believe I can do it. We used a taxi to get to the caves but unfortunately he dropped us off at a different cave site, we did manage to walk from there but were nearly late so if you choose to use a taxi make sure you are at the correct caves before the taxi leaves. Lockers were provided for free and there was a toilet in the changing rooms. There was also a caf\u00e9 to get snacks and well needed drinks.

They explain everything, from the geological history of the cave to the small stories that happened in it! They help you a lot when it gets hard to climb, putting their hand or knee under your feet to help you. They make you feel comfortable, check on you all the time. there is a room that looks like an amphitheater and they take the time to make you feel the space, loosing and reaching your senses.

The tour within the caves has walkways (as long as you don't choose adventurous caving option) this makes it an easy walk with some ladders and steps which can be quite slippy due to the water dripping in the caves, dress quite warm as it can get quite chilly."

The caving starts from a small entrance and a long descend from a long ladder. From there, the underground world is beautiful. Sometimes a bit challenging to go through the narrow passages. But that's part of the fun.The light on your head adds a extra dimension to the experience. I really enjoyed the underground 'church' . If you suffer from claustrophobia, don't go in. It is sometimes very narrow. If you don't suffer from claustrophobia, GO HERE! :)"

Once we got there we had to do a lot of waiting around for a big group of people who were travelling Europe together (this was really annoying as it meant we overran by about an hour and a half and missed out dinner reservation). We got our overalls and headtorches and headed into the caves. Our guide was crazy but brilliant, although I did find it hard to keep up at times. Some of the gaps you have to squeeze through look impossible but somehow you have to get through as there is pretty much no option to turn back. This will be no good for anyone who doesn't like the dark or tight spaces. Be careful taking a phone or camera as you will be crawling on your front and using your hands a lot.

I chose this activity because I thought it would be like Lurray or Carlsbad caverns in the U.S. Only with views of older cities buried under Budapest.  We met a guide near the train station. He boarded a bus with us and we rode to the area of the caves. We were given jumpsuits and helmets to wear and I was told to let them know if mine fit. We crossed the road to the cave entrance, a little graffiti covered door in the rocky side of a hill. In a little chamber we were given instructions on how to crawl and squeeze through small spaces and what order to go in. I was first behind the guide , my husband behind me. Next were a couple in their forties, one with claustrophobia. After them were about 6 caving enthusiasts in their 20's and in very good physical condition.  We followed the guide down a forty foot ladder then proceeded to crawl, slide on our hind ends slither on our bellies and backs and climb up and down very narrow tunnels of rock. In one spot we had to turn our head sideways so the helmet would fit through. There were small room like openings between the tight tunnels where we could rest and the guide told us about the cave. I figured out after a tight 10 foot tunnel that if I hadn't fit in my jumpsuit, (it was their largest size), I wouldn't have been able to go. I'm a woman's US size14.  We squeezed our way through the tunnels for about two hours pulling and pushing with our fingers and feet in places where it was to tight to bend our knees or elbows. My husband pushed me through the tightest and steepest tunnels. We eventually came to a large room where we could walk around. The rest was a 15 min climb up a medium size tunnel back to the 40 ft ladder and out.  I have never been so far off in imagining what an excursion would be like. Caverns and caves are totally different experiences. I was very proud of myself and also shaking from the exercise but not as proud of the claustrophobic man. I wouldn't do it again but I am glad I did it once. My husband loved it."

It's an amazing experience to venture into these caves with expertly trained guides who will occasionally dash past you as if they are spider men and women. The cave is nice and cool but I would still suggest wearing light clothing because the caving suit isn't very breathable. This is also an activity for the athletic and fit. Not only is it strenuous but the holes which you will need to fit through are very tiny. I am overweight and got stuck for a moment, as did people smaller than me.

Booked thru Viator, very convenient meeting place, near giant mall,catching local buses with guides easy and nice way to get to meet other cavers. Caving seems to attract a very interesting, well traveled group. Went with teen daughters 14&18. I was a bit worried that I might not be able to handle the claustrophobia part-- It was close, but the guides are well seasoned. Ours, Lottie, was funny, charming and could recognize a little panic in my eyes- he had me follow after him on the difficult= narrow \"squeeze throughs\", I definitely challenged myself which feels great for a 50+ mom. We had 9 travelers in our group- all fun and interesting (and relatively thin) The guides choose cave trail depending the size of the group's participants. The cave has trails with assorted size opening. Don't worry you won't get stuck! We came prepared with sweat shirts, no need, guide said tee shirts were fine- the exertion warms you up. Sneakers are a must.We stored our belongings (including all jewelry) in lockers and were safe. Carried phone/ camera, glad I did. You are given a hard hat with light and sturdy coveralls, make sure they are not tight as you really need to move in them. Take a little Ibuprofen before you go to bed, we all were a little sore next day-WELL WORTH THE EXPERIENCE!When we left we went to the bus stop on the road, caught bus #65 down the hill to the bus turn around. Across the street you'll find a good pizza, pasta, salad place called VAPIANO, great choice, self service, indoor or patio seating. Right around corner is the street you take back to the Mall."

If you're not someone who is very fit you might find it a little bit difficult, but you'll be pushed out of your comfort zone and the adrenaline rush that you get once you enter the cave keeps you going. Here are some little tips:-the tour starts off with a 10m long ladder down into the cave, which looks pretty scary but you'll be instructed to hold on very tightly.-parts of the cave are very, very slippery. wear shoes with a good grip!-our tour started off quite slow but eventually we were told to speed up at the end, which was quite tiring.-after the tour you'll have the chance to rest in this little cafe close to the changing rooms, so bring some cash to buy some drinks and food!"

In fact they encourage you just to wear like a tshirt and pants under your overall b/c you are working hard in there so you have no problem keeping warm.There is a locker room with lockers but they are not individually locked, they just lock the entire room. So I would recommend not bringing anything of too much value.Definitely not for the faint-hearted but you can do this if you are fit, even if you've never caved before, the guides are very good. I would definitely do it again and the fee is reasonable (7000 HUF which is around 25 EUR). Is a bit of a annoyance getting out there, but it is DEFINITELY worth it. One of my favorite experiences from Budapest! Also, if you will be doing any of the Baths, plan that for the day after this to relax afterwards!"

Its a completely different world inside there. One of the best things to do in Budapest with your group of friends. The guides were fun to be with. I'd say it was a great and a definitely worthwhile experience."

You get completely suited up (thick overall and hard helmet with torches attached) and after a quick briefing you're good to go! We were underground for just over 2 hours but it flew by as we were either on the move or listening to our fab tour guide (Lot-C? Sorry if that's spelt wrong!). You're able to take your phones/cameras down too - there's a pocket on the overall for them - which I recommend because this is an experience you won't want to forget!

Needless to say, if your are uncomfortable in tight spaces this might not be the best attraction.The guide was very good, providing interesting information about the caves during our visit and also squeezing in the occasional joke. The tour lasts for approx. 2,5 hours. When you are at the deepest point you are approx. 55 meters below the ground.You may leave personal belongings in cabinets provided by the tour company, however please note that the cabinets are not locked. I would advise against bringing big / clunky or expensive camera equipment with you on this tour, simply due to the fact that there are quite a few narrow passages where crawling is necessary and you might bump you camera equipment into the rock walls. Smaller cameras and GoPros should be okay.Tip: the overalls you will be wearing are water proof and the fabric doesn't really breathe much. You will be quite warm while walking / crouching / climbing through the caves, hence wearing just a t-shirt and a pair of shorts under your overall is a good recommendation. Also, make sure you book this attraction a few days in advance as the available places quickly fill up."

That was not the case! I had such a blast caving and would 110% do it again!!Caving is more of an exhilarating, thrilling activity. You definitely need to be in some shape to do it, it is definitely a work out. While caving, you're in the caves awhile but you're having so much fun you don't even know where the time has gone. While caving you're sliding head first, backwards, you're on your side, contorting your body to fit in all these tight spaces and to slide under these rocks to get deep into the cave.I have not laughed so much in such a long time. Just seeing the little spaces you're about to go through makes you laugh because you're literally thinking \"how in the world am I about to fit through there?!\" and then seeing people try and fit through them is hysterical!On top of that, it's a great way to meet people! Caving is definitely a team effort and I felt like our group connected so much by the time we had finished. No joke, those were the people I ended up spending the rest of my time in Budapest with. Our guide was great, he was so fun to watch, literally running, jumping and sliding with such ease through all these spaces, it's insane. He was so knowledgable too and gave you great information about the caves.I can't stress enough how much you should do this! You will not regret it one bit."

Cost was 6000 forint (AUD28-30) and totally worth it. You can only pay cash when you are there (no credit card) unless you book via a tour operator (more expensive I think).Takes about 45-60 minutes to get there from central Pest side via bus 9 (change at Kolosy Ter) and bus 65 (or 29 from memory).Our guide Mark was really good and engaging. He involved everyone. Lots of walking, talking after descending a tall metal ladder. Not recommended if you are overweight as plenty of tight spots to navigate. Couple of really tight bits, one on your stomach when you inch under a rock formation where you can't look forward ( my partner bailed on this one and went around) and another fab one the size of a birth canal (she made alas I was too wide in the hips).If you are reasonably fit, enjoy a bit of adventure and are claustrophobic then it's pretty good. My partner was a little apprehensive beforehand but enjoyed it.You are provided with overalls ( dusty) and a helmet. You will sweat a little so a tshirt and comfortable pants and shoes are all that's needed. Plus your shoes will get dirty! Can have a snack or beer afterward.Note that there doesn't appear to be a contact phone number."

Me and my boyfriend signed up for this, not really knowing what was coming for us - we assumed some walking in caves, possibly some crawling at some points - basically something \"everybody\" can do. What actually happened was much cooler; you get a helmet and an overall, and are told that there will be a lot of crawling - still thinking this will be nice 'n easy? As you enter the cave - down a long ladder - you walk a little bit, get some introduction and start crawling, squeezing, pushing - it was awesome! At one point we also tested what it was like if we turn all the headlights off, and how to guide each other - really cool! Even though it was challenging physically, you always feel it will be fine as the guides clearly now VERY well what they are doing (as well as being super entertaining), so there is never an actual safety issue.I would however not recommend this if you are very overweight, or not up for some actual caving - forget about a relaxed walk underground; this is much better in my opinion.PS: for booking: book on their website (just email them and make an appointment), and pay cash when you get there - heard it is cheaper than booking otherwise. PSS: slightly pain in the *** getting there, but well worth it - there are buses that stop nearby."

Our guide (Agi) was brilliant and took us on a tour that lasted about 3 hours although we could have easily spent another 3hrs in the caves. Being a group of guys we obviously chose the hardest route around which was physically challenging but totally worth it if you're up for a challenge. There are some seriously tight spots and some tricky climbs, decent shoes are essential to get yourself round, there were a few guys not fond of tight spaces but everyone made it through. The caves themselves are amazing to look at and Agi pointed out fossils on the way which were great to see. This was easily one of the best experiences we had ever had and for 6000 HUF (about \u00a315) would recommend it to anyone looking for an exciting day out in Budapest."

Our guide was great fun, knowledgeable and very helpful to my partner, who found it a little tougher. Just make sure to wear appropriate shoes and comfortable clothes for under the overalls. Also, just to provide a disclaimer: the tour is quite physically demanding and if you are not keen on tight spaces or getting a bit dusty, then a walking tour may be more suited to you. If, however, you enjoy a bit of adventure then this is an unmissable experience!

One of the must do things in Budapest - where else can you do a thing like this in a capital city?!It's really practical that the meeting point is in the city center because if i had to find this place on my own, i wouldn't know where to start (as you take two buses) - and it's easy to get back (you need 4 bus tickets!). It also helps that the guide (Lotzie - i really hope i spelled it right! He learned all out names) knows what he's doing and you can basicly see just how experianced he is (through words and actions) - it calms you down a great deal (being in a tight space, meters underground, without an exit even if you're not claustrophobic doesn't make you fell at ease). A lot of interesting information and 3 hours of interesting experiances that i haven't seen anywhere else yet (it's not just a walk on the designated path in the cave or a ride with a train). I think i will defenetly be doing this again the next time i visit (i've been to Budapest a couple of times already and am planing to visit again as it's an amazing city) - i really had a blast!You can also see that they take safety seriously, as it isn't exactly a walk in the park (you have to climb, crawl, duck walk, drag yourself..,) and it is a work out. It's not hard core adrenaline, but it's a really great adventure for most people - i'm not a sporty person, but it was really enjoyable - and defenetly worth the money i paid (which is saying a lot since a lot of places have really high admission and not really that much to see/so to make it worth it).Tip: Don't expect to come out clean out of this (it is \"crawling/climbing\" in the dirt) so pick some shoes you wouln't mind getting dirty and long fingernails will chip, belive me.

About 30 people were on our tour at the beginning, but we broke into groups of ten. I think the tour company should have more frequent tours but cap the number of participants in order to speed up the process. I would be easier to pick up ten people in a van than have 30 people take the bus.

You will have to squeeze through gaps you didnt think were possible, for people that are very claustrophobic it would nt be the best idea but to everyone else i guarantee you will have a blast!"

When we turned up we traveled with about 30 other travelers, mostly backpackers from hostels so if that's where you're staying then I think you'll be fine booking in-country!The only downside with such a large group is that we were waiting around in the cold for our group to get suited and start the tour. However, once we got going - wow! Our guide was fantastic, a real character and made the whole experience fun and not so scary. He was really supportive of those that felt slightly claustrophobic and for those with a more adventurous flair (like me) he was throwing us in with the more difficult route through the caves.Would highly recommend!"

You are going through some extremely tight holes. I do not think an obese person would fit as it was a tight squeeze for me. Basically you're crawling / sliding / climbing through an underground labyrinth for 3 hours. I'm generally not claustrophobic but I got pretty scared a few times. There are multiple places where you could easily slip and fall, and break a limb (or even die), and if something were to happen I don't know how you could make it back up to the surface as there is no easy exit. That said, it was also one of the best experiences I've had. It was terrifying at times but also exhilarating. If you're the adventurous type and like to push to the limits of your comfort zone then you will probably love this. Well worth the money (6000 HUF when I went)."

I was going there expecting something more or less ordinary (having visited caves in Greece). But no, this was completely different and you could tell from the first few meters. It is amazing to see how you can get 100+ meters below earth and see what nature can do. It's definitely off beaten track and has been really enjoyable. If you don't mind getting your hands dirty and searching for something different and exciting, then this is trully something you should do. The guides are excellent and do provide lots of info so that you can understand what is happening there."

The cave is a dry cave and so there is no getting wet, it is about 10 degrees down there so quite comfortable. Sometimes you are squirming through small holes, sometimes shimmying along ledges or just chilling out in caverns, it is all very surreal! Our guide Kata kept offering us the option of taking the hard or easier route and so I would say that this activity is suitable for people of all fitness levels. On the more technical parts Kata was excellent at giving us guidance on how to progress and didn't rush us at all.The cave is really cool, you get to go down to 35m below ground level and Kata was very good at telling us about the formation of the cave and its history.This was such made surreal fun I can't recommend it enough!"

Our guide Kata was helpful, and informative about the caves and rock/clay formation. We stopped to view fossils from when the area was a sea. Kata asked if we would like to cave completely in the dark. We turned all our lights off and in a safe section with no potholes we grabbed onto the foot of the person in front and trusted their advice, while we advised the person behind us of hazards. We were given options regarding side routes and when we ran into another group, deviated away from them. Kata also had a map of the network which she explained to us afterwards. We had a wonderful group who were really helpful, kind and supportive of each other so I was lucky there.Can I say a massive thank you to the reviewer who said \"Bring Knee Pads\" further down? Because of your review I bought cheap rollerblading knee pads before I left Australia and they were the only reason I had minor bruising only on my knees. Trade off: you will be slightly less flexible and knee pads chafe skin, but nicer than getting your knees banged up. You do a lot of crawling on hands and knees. Definitely not for anyone with a knee injury or a shoulder problem. The bus stop is quite easy to work out, have a good read of bus instructions in their briefing email and all is very clear. It is actually quite quick, perhaps 30 mins if timing is right, to get here from Vaci Utca on the metro, H5 overground and the bus."

First time I do this type of things and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Our guide was Frodo and he's really cool and has his own funny ways of navigating in the caves.There's a lot of crawling, both with face forwards and foot forwards (reverse crawling, if you wish), pulling yourself up in tight corners and sliding down.While it is not easy for large people (read tall) since you have to switch from legs backwards to forwards in a tight area, it is very much possible as there was a guy almost 2m tall who could do it.My friends didn't like it as much since it's not something you'd expect: it's very demanding and you need to make some weird moves in order to get into holes and out of them, sometimes even crawl on your sides.Your overalls have two pockets: one inside and one outside. You can take your phone/camera but you have to watch out they won't get cracked when you're hitting the floor for some weird crawling. You are allowed to take photos as well but you risk dirtying your equipment since you don't get gloves and it's pretty damn dirty down there. You absolutely have to bring shoes you don't care about because they will get really dirty and muddy at some point (nothing a little bit of water can't fix, but still..)I really recommend this if you are looking for something different and not afraid to try something new and demanding."

Recommend good and comfortable shoes that are ready to get dirty, and knee guard (not provided in my tour) for more protection. It is very warm with all the climbing, hence you can go with light clothing. Went for 10am tour, and it started promptly. Reservation is required.

He learned our names quickly (there were about 11 of us!) and would tell us to be careful going through certain parts and then swing himself through like a monkey!! Some parts were pretty scary - I would look and think 'no way am I going to fit through there' (one of our guys DID get stuck too - but it was hilarious with him shouting 'LEFT, RIGHT, SHIMMY, SHIMMY!' as he pulled himself out!!) and there are parts where you have to army crawl your way through, which I found great fun! The climbing back up was the hardest, where the rocks are slippy and you have nothing to hold onto. I got a little stuck at one point because I couldn't get to the top, and our guide was immediately there pulling me up. That was the only part where I needed help!Do be careful with your footing, one of our party fell down and landed on his ankle but as long as you watch your step, you'll be fine. Like I said, the guide was super attentive and always tells you if somewhere is slippery or there's a gap in the ground etc.A lot of fun and we had many laughs! Totally 100% recommend. :)"

It was a great experience, worth the money and worth the time. One of us wore hiking boots and the other sneakers, and both worked with equal amount of slipping in spots. Overall great service from Peter who replied to our late night email to Laci (c is pronounced like a t) who was our terrific guide. There were some tight spots, but Laci was great at guiding us through or over. I'm a 43-yr old well-endowed UK 38 and walk/run half marathons, so not super fit or super skinny. So if I can do this, you probably can too. Getting there was a bit of a challenge (we took M2) because the HEV 5 is under construction from Batthyany Ter (Nov 2014) but there is a temp bus to take you to Margit hid then HEV 5 to next stop then 65 bus at Kolosy Ter for 5 stops. Or, you could take the 9 bus to Kolosy Ter and switch to the 65 bus for 5 stops. Definitely heed the reviews about shorts and tee shirts. We are from Florida and not used to cold and we were fine with shorts and tees. We did get a late start due to waiting for a group to arrive, but went the full 2.5 hours. Laci was knowledgeable, helpful, and has a sense of humor. Check out the other reviews and website and if you want an out of the ordinary experience in Budapest, go caving."

It cost around \u00a320 each person which was great value for money.We met the guide, Laci, by Nyugati Station in Pest at half 1 and got 2 buses to the location in Buda. You need to make sure you have 4 single tickets with you for this as this is not included in the price. Myself and my partner decided to get 24 travel cards instead for convenience and also used them the next day etc. Also, you need to make your way back on your own so pay attention to the buses etc.You are provided with overalls and helmets - I advise to wear trainers. There is also room to leave your stuff in lockers and you can take your phones/cameras down underground with you, but don;t take anything that could get damaged! You are underground for around 2 hours and there are a number of routes you can go underground depending on the groups abilities, wants and needs. Our group decided to go through a particularly challenging route as to really give us the full experience. This is not for the faint hearted and isn't a walk in the park. It really does involve you to squeeze through tight gaps and challenges you to climb and slide on all different rocks and terrain etc. You get a massive adrenaline rush and feel like you really achieve something. Laci is great, one of the best tour guides I've ever had, and he makes sure everyone is ok and that everyone works together as a team. It was informative aswell as exciting and I could not recommend this trip any more - give it a go you'll be surprised at what you can achieve!"

Loti (I know I haven't spelt it properly) was a good, patient and informative guide. His knowledge was excellent although some of his jokes were less so! The crawling, climbing and sliding were challenging but definitely not too difficult for novices, helped by being part of a great group of people. I was disappointed when we came to the end, but pleasantly tired and ready for the cake that Loti recommended.If I had to have a criticism it would be that the meeting point was a bit vague, and time keeping was very 'flexible'. ( we were told to meet at 9.30 complete with the required bus tickets, one group arrived at 9.50 and we then had to go with them to get tickets and breakfast....) I would have found it useful to have known in advance that there were changing rooms and lockers rather than travel there and back in caving suitable clothing.That aside, our caving experience was one of the highlights of our trip to Budapest, and I now want to do some more!

They provide you with full body overalls and a helmet with light and then you spend about 3 hours guided through the caves. Climbing involves traveling through brief narrow passages and then regrouping in larger areas of the caves. The temperature is a constant 50 degrees so it is great whether it is hot or cold outside. We traveled in groups of about 10 people and it is great for kids as well (~10+ years). We did not see any stalactites, etc. in our tour, but I believe there are some around, but they are protected so that they are not destroyed by the tourists. This was a nice highlight in our time in Budapest. The caves were easily reached by public bus and the cost was a very reasonable."

We were by far the oldest of our group of 12 at 50+ but what great fun, brought back some way distant memories. Cave is slightly unusual in it's development and hence not full of pretty stalactites and mites but quite sporting with climbs and a few narrow spots and slides. Laci ? our guide had a great if slightly mad sense of humour and got the mixed nationality group working well together. Respect to the big guy who managed amazingly well. Such a change from over-eating and way too much culture in rest of city, if you are at all active give it a go,!"

A fair warning to anyone who is big or broad - I'm quite small, but even I had some trouble fitting through the gaps. There is a lot of crawling, sometimes on your belly, and if you are even a little claustrophobic it's quite spooky moving through tiny gaps (though they are always very brief and you can see the person in front of you). A super adventure and nothing quite like it, definitely for thrill seekers :) I would have given it 5 out of 5 if I wasn't just a little bit scared and relieved to be out at the end!"

Nestled within the Buda hills these beautiful caves offer excitement and mystery for those who choose to venture into the woods and descend the 10 meter ladder to the system's entrance - the chapel. Our guide, Helga, showed us through the complex and winding caves, making sure everyone was safe but giving them the freedom to explore and take their time when climbing, squeezing and admiring. The information Helga provided was engaging, as she managed to answer all questions and explain both geological aspects, as well as the myths and history of the caves. At times it was necessary to crawl, squeeze, and pull your way though crevices and tunnels; which may have made some people uncomfortable, but for me only added to excitement and mystery of the tour. The two and a half hours we spend in the caves were amazing, coming back to the surface felt unnatural and strangely sad. Once above ground I realized the experience had ignited a desire to further explore the world which lay beneath me, and I have since booked to go caving back home in England! I couldn't recommend this tour highly enough, it is very easy to get to by bus from central Budapest, the guides are friendly and knowledgeable, and the caves satisfy the need for adventure which exists within us all. After the caves we returned to Budapest via bus, when departing the 65/65A back to central Buda (where the connection from Pest station is), be sure to visit Istvanffi - a vegan burger bar, with delicious and affordable food (ceasar salad burger with chips - 550 fornits) which is mouthwatering for herbivors and carnivores alike!"

Prepare to challenge and manipulate your body in ways you didn't think possible as you work your way through small crevices and tunnels. The guides however will totally put your mind at ease and are excellent at communicating the best way to get through small spaces. Great that they give you overalls but prepare to wear shoes you won't mind getting dirty. Plan your visit to the thermal baths the day after as you will definitely leave a bit banged up and bruised. Despite the bruised knees I couldn't stop talking about how awesome caving was for the next week.

This time I was for sure not going to miss out, the positive reviews kept mounting which is why I wanted to give it a crack. Our guide Laci was as good as the reviews say, he met us at the train station and guided us to the caves, it might be a bit of jerking around getting the tickets for the two buses but this is how the price is so good. There was about 26 of us with three guides, we were in the third group which was outside the usual pub crawlers and I thank Laci for that. He gave us a full brief at the meeting point so we knew exactly what to expect. They give you overalls and flash light helmets, I wore jogging shorts and a t- shirt under and I was sweating while caving. The overalls are clean and the helmets and lights are quality. We went at the 3.30 pm time, it makes no matter the time as its in the dark anyway. They have lockers so you can lock away your valuables. I took a small video camera and it fixed in the pocket if the coveralls. I would suggest that you arrive in long pants and a sweater or jacket to wear at the end because your shirt in the cave will get sweaty. Laci was very informative and funny, he knew many things about the caves and points out many areas of interest, I suggest you pay attention and you might learn something. The caves are quite challenging if you have never done it, you go at least 50 meters under the ground and its stomach crawling and climbing, Laci takes you on the road which is suitable to your capability. Inside the caves we were at least 2.5 hrs, it's dark and humid but so exciting and untouched. I recommend you get into this your before the masses. I went with my girlfriend and we both loved it. I can't say enough about our guide Laci he really made the trip excellent for everybody."

It was an incredible experience - we were taken down in a group of 8 people with a very friendly guide who was clearly a very experienced caver. Her relaxed and calm attitude throughout the trip made the whole thing all the more enjoyable - some people at the start seemed a bit nervous but after the first few minutes everyone was having a great time. Near the end of our trip we all turned our lights off and she told us a few incredible stories of her passed caving experiences which was great! The darkness down there is profound, it was a truly surreal experience as you never really get to experience total darkness anywhere else!The trip itself was fairly active but everyone coped fine. You need to be able to navigate around rocks and support your body in tight spaces. It's definitely a challenge but this makes the experience all the more rewarding! There are some veryyyy tight crawl spaces that were very daunting at first but everyone made it through and the 'adrenaline high' is great!Since we were stuck down the cave with a group of 6 other travelers we inevitably became great friends with them by the end of the 3 hours! We ended up all going out for drinks afterwards and have since meet up with a couple of them in London! Everyone was friendly and I'd highly recommended this trip for everyone, from solo travelers to couples and larger friend groups."

This adventure was what I was most excited about in my trip to Budapest-but it just didn't work out so well.Here are some FYIs to make your experience better:1. The start time they give you is just a 'guess' at best. We arrived at 10 for our outing and were suppose to start at 10:30 but it was well after 11 before we even got our coveralls on. We had a car service picking us up and it cost a lot to be so late-we didn't get done until almost 2. So know that they run late and times are really just a suggestion.2. When I emailed I asked if I could pay in Euro-they responded \"yes\". However when I got there the guides said no-lucky for us we went downstairs and a man exchanged for us. I understand if they don't want to take Euro but they need to be upfront and honest-we would have been stuck.3. I had forgotten my knee pads (my fault)and asked for some-they acted like they didn't have them, although I could see a tub. Finally our guide (who was really great) said I could have them. You are crawling a lot-so bring knee pads.4. The description of the event doesn't really tell you what it is like-my friend is not active and has never done this type of thing and based on the description I thought she would be OK but it is actually VERY physical and she really struggled at the end. When they say you need to be fit-they mean it. You also have to be comfortable crawling and going through very tight places.5. Shoes-the floor of the cave is clay and quite slippery-you need traction. the site just says don't wear heals or flip flops-what you really need is shoes with good traction to help minimize the possibility of slipping.6. Bring a case for your camera to protect it and also the clay dust will get in everything. They have lockers for you but no locks. All our stuff was OK but I would not bring any valuables to this location. You are sliding on your butt a lot and crawling so anything (phone) in your pockets will take a pounding.7. You start out the adventure descending down a long ladder-FYI. You also climb up it. This is an unique experience and if you are use to do these type of physical adventures you are OK."

We arrived on time for the tour but because of the amount of ppl the changing room space and the equipment we started late. I would recommend wearing old and lose clothing long sleeves shirts as the caves receive little heat and it can be nippy. Also if you have grip gloves or hiking shoes bring them along for two reasons you get very dirty climbing around and some of the surfaces are moist, with the wrong shoes you may find it difficult to get a good grip. Zoli our guide was a treasure. He was encouraging, calm, highly knowledgable and witty. We had so much fun and were astonished at how easy it all was. Make sure you bring cash to pay as there are no machines available on site. Happy caving."

I love walking through caves, but was initially put off when I realised it'd involved squeezing through tiny spaces. My boyfriend seemed very up for it however when I mentioned in conversation so I decided to be brave and just go for it, I am really glad I did!We had Laszlo (or Latsi? I wish I could spell his nickname :D) as our guide. He said he'd been exploring these caves for 19 years, guiding in them for 12, and knew them like the back of his hand. It was very reassuring how confident and cheerful he was, and he kept giving us helpful instructions to help us get through the harder parts of the tour. Anyone who is a bit nervous should know the guides make you feel very safe, He suggested we took the harder route (decided by people's size and abilities) and as my group agreed. This made me a little nervous at first as while I am not big I don't work out at all...but we all kept up just fine! Laszlo also made a real effort to learn all our names and chat with us all which was really nice. I should point out that the more difficult parts of the tour are only 2-3 metres long max, so if you aren't fond of small spaces it's nice to know they don't go on for ages!The caves were really fun to explore, me and my boyfriend both had an awesome time despite my apprehensions and are really glad we did it! My joints ached a bit the next day but that's nothing I can't live with. Thanks to Laszlo and Caving under Budapest for a brilliant experience :)"

I was excited about doing this when my friend and I first signed up, and then really nervous the day of after I'd made the mistake of Googling images from the caves. However, despite my fears, the experience ended up being the highlight of my Central European vacation.Our guide, I wish I could remember his name, was a fantastic little spider-monkey with the way he just leapt, slid, and climbed his way through the caves. I always felt very safe with him and our group. During our 3-hour trek through the caves, we encountered a few other groups, so I know there are several different paths the guides can choose from. I believe they choose their route based on the group they have, so if you have any particular challenges or fears, mention them right away, and the guide can work around them. Our guide said that they've had special tours for children with physical handicaps so if they can do it, anyone in reasonably decent health can too. The guide also said that he once had a 6'2\" American footballer on a tour and he made it through, with some course adjustments from the guide.I did not find the experience too physically taxing, and I would say I'm only in average shape. Perhaps it's because we often stopped for breaks during the trek, either so the rest of the group could catch up, or so the guide could explain the history/geology of the caves. But you will leave with bruises and maybe scrapes on your knees and elbows.I know some people really enjoy being scared or spooked, so I hope what I write next doesn't spoil anything for them. However, as someone who absolutely hates being frightened, I always appreciate a heads up. There were a couple of times on the trek when our guide popped out from nowhere to gently scare us. It was easy to tell it was coming though, because you could hear the shrieks from the group members further ahead in line. There was also a point when we sat in the 'theater' cave and turned off all our lights, which might be scary if you don't like the dark. Lastly, you can bring your camera into the caves with you. There is a pocket in the coveralls. But it will get dusty! Everything gets dusty! it's worth a little dirt and grime for this experience though."

Our tour guide- Frodo as he called himself- was energetic, informative, and altogether a great guide! We had some concerns how physically difficult it would be but it wasn't a problem at all.

He made a real effort to speak to every member of the group and ask them about themselves and was patient and encouraging, particularly with those who found it more challenging. Speaking of which, in my opinion, I didn't find it massively difficult but I'm relatively fit and active (not to mention small which definitely helped!) and absolutely love adventuring and climbing. Even so, I was tired by the end of it and covered in bruises! I can see how others might find it challenging as, obviously, caving involves climbing, crawling and small dark spaces! One member of our group (a middle-aged man) got a bit panicky and wanted to leave not long into the tour as he feared he was going to get stuck but, after lots of encouragement by our patient guide (and all of us having to take a slightly easier route than was initially planned), he carried on and ended up enjoying himself. If you suffer from claustrophobia and/or hate the idea of crawling and climbing about underground then this definitely isn't for you but, otherwise, give it a go!"

            "review": "A review from two 40-yr-olds who took two kids:. This was a day to remember! It is very interesting and our guide spoke excellent English; he was funny, helpful and an all-around good guy. This is a great way to spend a day, and an even better way to do something you'll always remember while visiting Budapest. Now, there are a few things to take into consideration: 1)this is a big draw for the 20-something year-old backpackers--we were the only people there over the age of 30, and certainly the only ones who brought children. Everyone was very nice, but we should have gotten a hint on how challenging this might be just by the age of those in our group. 2)You wear proper equipment (a jumpsuit and hard hat with lamp) but there is no padding, so be prepared for you knees and elbows to be scrapped raw and there will be plenty of bruises! If I were going again, I would take knee pads for sure. If you are older, please be sure you're in good shape--THIS IS HARD WORK! You will climb using just your upper body to pull you through, you will belly crawl through tiny openings, and you wedge yourself between slippery rocks where it's difficult to get footing. I'm a 40-year old who runs four miles several times a week, and I found this very challenging. 3)If you are taking children: make sure they are in good shape and do not scare easily! Again: 40-meter ladder climb, tiny crevices, dark, etc., and everything is single-file, so no hand-holding. I took two boys, ages 14 and 10 (the caving age limit is 10-55 years old), and they had a blast, but it was hard work and I could see where those who are not \"tough\" could easily get scared when they get stuck (and you will get stuck) or just generally have a difficult time of it. So, yes--awesome experience. So glad I did it once. My boys will always remember Budapest for the caving--but please sign up knowing that it is a great deal of work, is very challenging, even for those who are fit, and you will be battered and bruised at the end--but all in good fun!"

The guides are fully trained and organised people into groups (it appears they place people of similar build/athletic ability so that each group has a reasonable amount of difficulty so that no one gets bored or to avoid some obstacles to be too tricky for some but not others). Very safe at all times, although a lot of fun to be had. Just do it."

I had never been caving before but this was a fantastic introduction.

There are some really really small crawl throughs however I think the guides assess the size of the people in the group and take you on routes accordingly. I felt completely safe all the way although wouldn't recommend to anyone who is unsure of small spaces. A lot of people were on their own so it's a good way to meet people if your travelling on your own in Budapest. You are however left to find your way back to the meeting point after the caving involving a few buses but it was fairly straight forward. Make sure you wear suitable footwear that you don't mind getting covered in clay :) you get an overall to cover up your clothes. It was really nice and cool in the caves but not too cold. Overall we had a fantastic time and was definitely worth the price of 5000 ft's each :D"

It was sooooo much fun and you will feel a sense of accomplishment once completed but here are a few things to keep in mind:-you crawl, climb and slide for over two hours-you slide and crawl through some of the tightest holes ever-there is ALOT of dust, you will get dirty-Wear comfortable clothes and shoes with good traction-if you are super tall or of a significantly fuller figure, im not sure how you will get through it, but worth a try.With that said we are SOOOOO happy we did it. I was an AWESOME AWESOME experience. -"

They do not lock individually, but the cabin is locked by the guides.The difficult route is NOT for those that consider themselves unfit or may have health concerns. There are two other routes that may be more suitable.My fiance and I decided to give this a try as our last adventure in Budapest. The meeting point was a little confusing as there were no signs and as the meeting time got close we began to get worried. Eventually we bumped in to other confused people and became a group just standing around until someone with a, \"Budapest Caving\" shirt came up. Other than the initial confusion the trip was great.We had to take a couple of buses to get to the caves so make sure you have a bus pass or tickets handy. Once we were at the site we suited up and walked a short distance to the cave entrance. Our guide spoke broken English and was a bit hard to understand at times but she relayed all important safety information that we needed and at no time did we have any real communication barriers. The cave is NOT for those who are even slightly claustrophobic or afraid of the dark. After a 10m climb down a ladder we walked and crawled a ways before deciding on which trail to take. I suggested the difficult route (from Easy, Medium, and Difficult) and the rest of the group agreed so off we went. And it was difficult. It was not overly physically challenging but it is not for those that are not in shape or may have health problems (the Easy and Medium routes are probably a better bet).Our guide had us climbing up and down, sliding around on our backs, crawling on hands and kness, and the most difficult part: crawling snake like on our bellies with stone cave walls brushing against all sides of us. This intense army-crawling had me able to only squeeze by centimeters at a time in places.Now, I am a physically fit, 25 year old male, 6'6\", 230 lbs. There were a couple of times that I got pretty close to not fitting so be warned, if you are any bigger you may have some troubles. You will build up a heavy sweat even though the cave is 50 degrees F the entire year round. The entire cave floor is covered in clay deposits and makes some parts pretty slippery. Overall, this was a great experience. It is a challenege for those who have never gone caving before and well worth the price and time."

Several of the people we were in the group with mentioned that this was one of the best caving experiences they've been on and they've been through a few. Some things to know - they do provide lockers so you can lock up any items before you go on the trip (we didn't know this and arrived in shorts and a tee even though it was cold out). It does get very warm down there especially with all the wiggling and crawling you do so make sure you dress for that. I had a lot of bruises which was then treated to a nice Turkish bath right after. Our guide was hilarious - at one point he tied my shoe laces together when I was wiggling through a particular small spot. My hips almost got stuck in one of the spots... I'm not sure how bigger people did it. I would definitely recommend this activity to anyone visiting Budapest!"

She was so comfortable and obviously enjoyed the cave so much it put all of us in a great mood, and felt safe the whole time. All told we were a group of 8 in our mid-20's.There were a few parts that were challenging, for the really adventurous. Really tight parts, or a slide.The best part, though, was the \"worm hole,\" a 18m crawl with lamps off. You must absolutely trust the people in front of you to guide you through the path, and pass it to those behind you. After coming out of it, the rest of your fellow cavers turn into great friends!5000HUF per person. Don't pay at the little window inside the cabin, pay the tour guide directly."

I must say, I was a bit scared because I have mild claustrophobia and a great fear of heights, and neither of us has done this before so had no idea what to expect.We met our guide in the city, and he helped us get to the caves with public transport. We were divided into two groups, and being in the second one we had to wait a while for him to get the first one started. Then we got to the changing rooms, paid him (in cash, which you have to) and he handed over the helmet and overalls. Once changed we walked a little bit to the opening of the cave, and went down a high ladder. I can say that now afterwards, that was the scariest part for me! =P There weren't any really high drops, and even the smallest hole was over quickly, so I had no reason to be scared and felt safe the whole time (I was afraid of long tunnels of crawling on your back, and thankfully there were none of that)The guide joked a lot, and helped us to understand how to get through all of the obstacles. It was really dark down there! When we turned off our headlights, it was truly pitch black! Me and my boyfriend both brought gloves, and afterwards we heard some of the group say that this would probably have been a good call for them as well. We both had some bruises and scratches, but it wasn't as tiring as we thought, both being absolutely out-of-shape ;) It took us about 2-3 hours down there, we met the guide in the city a bit before 3:45, and we got out of the caves around 8.After it was all over, I think this was the thing my boyfriend enjoyed the most on our trip, and I can honestly say that I did enjoy it as well (and I agree with the other reviewer here that said it feels like you are a big kid), although it might not have been my favourite ;)"

I have mild claustrophobia, but pushed myself to do this and never felt truly scared. You will spend up to three hours in the caves, and you will get muddy and sweaty. It can be quite hard work.

There were some really narrow bits that I didn't think we could pass through. The theater place was really cool, would be really interesting to come on one of the events that they sometimes do there. I also loved how spontaneous the whole thing was. Our guide, also named Gabor (he was great by the way, really helpful and funny guy) showed us at the end how to get back on the top of the ladder area without using the ladder, and when I attempted after him just for the hell of it, he was really supportive and by the time I realized it, I was up like 5 meters, too late to come down! He showed steps how he'd suggest going further up, but he didn't mind when I tried it in a different way and he was there next to me in case of trouble. Exhilarating! Definitely aiming for the extreme tour next time."

We were able to book onto a trip the next day.It's slightly complicated to travel there but if you meet the guide at the bus station, as instructed, the whole trip goes quite smoothly.They give you the overalls and helmet to go caving. When they recommend that you only need a t-shirt and thin trousers underneath, they are not lying. When you get into the caves and start moving around, you will get VERY warm. It is also advisable to bring/wear shoes that you don't mind getting muddy.The whole caving experience was brilliant. There is a lot of climbing and crawling so you need to have a certain amount of agility.This is certainly an experience not to be missed.

I had never caved before- going into it having few expectations and without having looked at a single picture of the caves (and hearing from equally uniformed people that there were \"cities\" in these caves), the bopping around neath the ground was easily my favorite thing I did in Budapest during the three days I was there. While it might sound unnerving to descend many meters beneath the surface, squeeze through cracks in limestone, and experience total sense deprivation, the care and optimism with which our guide, Laszlo, led us through the \"Big Ring\" route extinguished any sense of fear! We worked as a team. Laszlo was really knowledgable about the geology of the region and enthusiastically responded to all of our questions about the caves and his own experiences caving. Thank you so much to Adventure Caving for opening up this opportunity for even athletically challenged people to explore these incredible landscapes!"

The price was very reasonable and one of the guides met us at a central location in Budapest and took us to the caves in 20mins on the local buses. The tour guides were very knowagable and very funny. The whole experience was really great and a lot of fun. We were exhausted after it but it was definitely worth the trip. Highly recommended!"

We made our reservations at http://caving.hu/. The price was 5,000 HUF, which is about $22 US dollars at the time of this post. The price didn\u2019t include the round-trip public bus ticket that we had to take to the place but it did include a guide, overalls, helmet, and headlamp. Without the guide we would never find our way out.My friend and I had a great time here and the guide was terrific but his jokes weren't too funny. haha.. for a full trip report to the underground caving, check out my blog at http://travelwithyj.wordpress.com/2014/02/07/part-2-budapest-thailand-hong-kong-trip-report-2/"

Now I am a 48 year old bloke who likes a pint and has a bit of a belly. I weigh 17 stone and the guide assured me that I should have no trouble navigating the caves, but the spaces were TIGHT! I got stuck on one of the very fist holes ( Where you have to assume the \"Superman\" position for your reference) There is no way this would be allowed back in the UK. By the time Health & Safety have done a risk assessment they would shut the place down. You crawl through a tiny little hole on your belly into a cavern then you crawl through an even smaller hole into the next cavern. This goes on for 2 hours! I am not claustrophobic but boy was I was glad I was out of there in the end. I kept thinking \"if I get trapped how will they get me out?\" as you are half a mile underground! My son coped well but there again he is only 21 but even he said there was one bit he got stuck and panicked a bit so it was not just me! In the end I was out of breath and dripping in sweat. The caverns themselves are nothing special, just muddy brown rocks and although the guide Lottie pointed out various formations and fossils throughout there is not loads to see, but it was the apprehension of the next gap that I had to squeeze through that spurred me on! So glad I did it but never again! There is a real sense of achievement when I had done it."

I read others reviews about this caving experience before visiting and I was really excited to go, but the trip failed to meet my expectations on every level. First, I arrived on time to the meeting point at 3:45, but we did not get on a bus to head to the caves until 4:30 because the guides were dealing with an upset older gentleman who could not participate without a doctors note. Not their fault, but it got worse.When we got to the cave site, after being literally PACKED onto the city bus, they separated us into 5 groups, because not every group could fit in the changing rooms at one time. They said each group would take about 10 minutes to change into the caving jumpsuit. They were wrong. It took 25-30 minutes. I was in group 5. I waited nearly two hours and finally got into the locker room, only to realize all the lockers were already taken, thus having to cram my stuff into a corner, unprotected. So at 6:45, mind you I've waited three hours already, our group finally enters the cave, only to learn that our guide has only spent 6 months learning English. I learned absolutely nothing about the caves, no matter how simple question I asked. Additionally, due to starting late, we were hustled through every room, and left the caves at 7:45. We were promised about a 2-2.5 hour tour. I only spent an hour in there. Liars.Overall, even if my experience was not a complete failure, I would not recommend the caves. They really aren't too exciting, there's no cool rock formations or crystals, its just all brown rocks. Whoopdy Doo. If you DO choose to do it, just make sure you are in group 1 and that your guide knows English."

We both thought we would be walking around in a cave looking at stalactites and stalagmites. Boy, were we wrong! Firstly, we were with a group of straight out off college kids. Never a good sign. Putting on the overalls and seeing how grubby they were, told me this was going to be a lot more active that we thought.Upon entering the cave, you have to climb down a ladder. Being 5 foot tall, Im scared of most things, so here, I was absolutely petrified. I realised it was too late to turn back so just bit my tongue and proceeded, especially after seeing the absolute joy in my partner's face.You're in there, your'e crawling, sliding, climbing, you have to listen carefully to the guide otherwise if you dont, you'll get stuck in a hole. No ropes, harnesses or carabiners. No such thing as health and safety. Could not fault any part of it. I'm sorry to my group as I moaned a lot. But as I said, upon reflection, I'm really proud of myself for doing it. I only sort of regret is not bringing my phone/camera with me. I was scared of it getting crushed or broken (and rightly so!)It cost 5000 forints (around \u00a315) per person which includes the helmet with headlight and overalls. You have to pay for your own travel to and from the cave. The lockers provided did not lock, but everything was there when we got back. There's a cafe on site with beer and food.It's not for everyone, certainly not for me, but I loved it.I cant remember the name of our guide, but she was awesome and deserves praise."

I just want to make sure you've got the right one.This review is for a tour via www.caving.hu at P\u00e1l-v\u00f6lgyi cave in Buda. We booked through our hotel, other hostels offer bookings as well. The english guided tours are \"late afternoon\" Monday, Wednesday, Friday. it was 5000HUF per person. We met at the Nyugati p\u00e1lyaudvar train station in Pest and took two buses there with a chaperone. Most of the other people were young hostellers, early 20's, only a few 30+. Bus tickets are not included, but we recommend getting a travel pass (transport only, available for one, three, five and seven day tickets, includes metro, trams, buses and ferries). Oddly, all the young people had to buy bus tickets, the older folks didn't. Ha ha. Noobs.Upon arrival we were broken into groups of about 9-10, and went in shifts to change into the gear. You are provided with a helmet with light and jumpsuit. Recommend you wear good hiking/walking shoes that you don't mind getting dirty. Glasses are ok for most parts, and you can fit a compact camera or mobile into the pocket of the jumpsuit. You have to sign a waiver \"for insurance purposes\", but it didn't seem very formal. There is a pub and cafe underneath for afterwards. Remember to pee before you go.The tour is 2.5 - 3 hours, you will return to town around 8-9pm. (We met at the train station at 15:45.) the guides are excellent, speak good English, and are very good At what they do. Ours was hilarious and moved like a spider monkey over rocks. He said he'd been caving for 12 years.The tour is adapted to the skill level of your group. We opted for a slightly more challenging path, but we took it slow with frequent breaks for the less-fit members to recuperate. And your shoes will get dirty.If you like scrambling over rocks and squeezing into tight spaces, you absolutely must do this tour before some stupid tourist sues them and they're forced to put in ropes and stuff. This is not recommended for people who can't climb to the citadel in the city or those who are morbidly obese or ridiculously un-fit. Yes, you can do this if you are over 30, my husband and I managed better than some of the young frat boys in our group. You do this at your own risk, so don't over reach yourself.But OH MY GOD IT WAS SOOOOOO FREAKIN AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

It's a little disorganized though, and the tour starts over 1.5 hours after the meeting time (the guy who met us was a little standoffish, and the lady at the store at the venue was quite rude as well-refused to let us fill our water bottles :/). Small inconveniences, the tour was good enough to make me forget all this!"

Definitely not for the claustrophobic, as you have to wriggle through holes and angle yourself in a certain way to make it through at times. It's totally worth it, though, and a really fun 2 hours. The deepest part of the cave is 50m - we turned off our headlamps and experienced complete silence (anything closer to ground level still echoes sounds of water running, leaves rustling, etc.) and darkness. They provide you with a full suit and a headlamp and helmet, but bring shoes that have traction and that you don't mind getting dusty and muddy. It's cold down there but you'll heat up really quickly - crawling through caves is more of a physical exertion that I thought it would be."

Great value for money too.Our guide was great, clearly very enthusiastic about caving and made the tour fit-for-all and a fun and informative experience. He had very good English too. When we were clearly all ok with the initial route, he upped the difficulty....I thought I might panic going through tight gaps but I felt in safe hands....especially because some of the holes we had to climb through were soooo tight, literally didn't think I would make it through some of them!! It was very challenging and I was totally battered and bruised from the experience, would repeat it in a second though!The caves aren't overly beautiful, but it is a great activity and so much fun. You get really warm when you are down there so just a t-shirt and jeans underneath the overalls they provide was fine.They lock up all your valuables when you are down there and you are able to take a camera with you. They provide overalls and a helmet which are needed! Wear practical footwear! And be prepared for them to get dirty, it's very dusty and because it had been raining was quite slippy and slimy when I went so shoes were stinking when I came out!One down side is the time it takes to get going....our guide was waiting for a team of 40 odd people (they split you into smaller groups at the caves)....we were due to meet at 3:45pm and weren't in our overalls until gone 5pm. There are two buses required to get from the meeting point to the caves too, but the guide comes with you and then you just have to repeat this journey on the way back on your own (which is fine as there will probably be a big group of you).Definitely an activity worth doing....2.5hrs flies by too! I wanted to stay down there....although my aching muscles and bruised body was probably glad I didn't. Ideal activity to do before checking out the Budapest spas the next day!There is also a bar at the location where you can buy alcohol and food after the adventure."

Inside the cave it is pitch dark (you will have a small light on your helmet), initially I felt uncomfortable but after about five minutes I was fine. I am of average sized(height and weight)and in excellent shape so if you are a large person or you are not in some kind of decent shape this will be an extremely challenging experience.

I like the mental challenge (and for me, this was far more a mental challenge than a physical one.) Call me crazy, but in the end I have absolutely no regrets for this Budapest caving experience. So let me run through the important facts:1. Everyone is right- it took hours from the moment we met at the bus stop to actually getting our coveralls on for the cave. While it was incredibly annoying, I forgot all about it once the experience was over.2. As soon as you walk into the cave you climb down a metal ladder. For me, that was the scariest part because that was the official descent into the unknown. There was no turning back...well, one guy did turn back after walking through the first tunnel (which wasn't that small so good thing he did!)3. The holes get smaller and smaller. But it also get's less and less scary...you aren't crawling through them for long periods of time AND you're getting used to the idea that your body can fit into tinier spaces than you ever thought. Plus, it really helped that the guide was cracking jokes and making you feel safe and comfortable throughout the whole journey. The guide definitely made the journey 100x better than it would have been with a crappy guide (like I had during my first experience.)4. The first half of the journey is climbing down into the cave...so naturally you have to climb back up! This was actually scarier for me than the crawling because a) the rocks are slippery and b) I have fear of heights. Nevertheless I managed it, and it really wasn't that bad. Just make sure your shoes have good grip (mine didn't), and if you're truly scared, crawl on your hands and knees....you'll be bruised later but that's no big deal.5. Even if it's 11 degrees down there, it feels HOT from all the climbing and crawling. So wear shorts and a t-shirt that you don't mind sweating profusely in. 6. Make sure you don't have to pee- get it all out while you're waiting to start and really try not to drink any liquids before you go in! Even though you'll be doing a lot of physical activity, you can live without water for a few hours.7. You might be scared, but guess what- most of the people on that tour had no clue what they were getting into either. Everyone was equally as nervous but all came out loving it! If you think you can manage to control your fears and you're looking for a little bit of a thrill...JUST DO IT. I promise you won't regret it! If you have severe claustrophobia though, then obviously skip this!"

Good:Caving is fun and good exerciseUnique way to see the Buda side and then explore natural cavesBadThe tour asked us to meet at a bus stop at 1:45. By 3pm we didn't even have our caving coveralls on. The organization could be much better. Also, make sure that you know how to get back home as after the tour you are left on your own at the site. Also, although the cave is 10o, it is very warm in the coveralls and tight spaces and there is physical work in wiggling through small holes. Dress lightly and with supportive shoes that can get dirty"

Definitely wear shorts and a t-shirt or tank top underneath the overalls they provide, because you get really sweaty with the effort of getting around. If you have hiking boots, bring those, but if not regular tennis shoes will do just fine. I'm not super fit but do walk 20 minutes 3x a day and I was fine. Our guide was wonderful and shared lots of information about the caves and about Budapest in general with us."

Although the website says suitable from 14-55 I would most definitely not recommend anyone who was unfit to attend this as many places are very slippery and there were many tight spaces.If you take a camera inside, make sure it's at least waterproof as it will get very dirty (dust is everywhere and humidity is 100%).Our guide was amazing and answered all the question everyone in the group had. We even had the option to take different routes depending on the preferences of everyone in the group.Note that the meeting place for the tour is actually in the city center and you'll need to pre-book with your accommodation in order to attend."

The guide instilled confidence, he was joking around and was very relaxed which helped the rest of the group feel more relaxed about the whole situation, he paid attention to every member of the group and made the group look out for each other. I know we took the \"hard way\" but I don't know how it relates to the other possible paths in the cave, however there was a few very tight spots but mostly it was followed by big areas to relax in.I got very warm, even though I only wore shorts and a t-shirt under the overall, light clothing recommended. And good shoes! Most of the participants wore simple shoes like Converse, one even wore Crocs(!!) and it works, but better shoes would just make it a bit easier to get a grip in some slippery areas.Over all, a great adventure, and for me a slightly life-changing one as well."

I figured I'd be walking through some dark passages of rocks and caverns... it was a bit more extreme than that. Having a bit of claustrophobia, I don't think I'd have participated if I had known the extent of the tight spaces. Dressed in proper spelunking attire, coveralls and a headlamp, you descend into the caves and begin an hour of crawling, climbing and worming your way through crevices that appear impossibly tight.This activity is physically strenuous and is not conducive to those who are not in decent shape. I say that as a caution for anyone who may think this activity has been exaggerated.Definitely would do it again."

In the end there went almost 20 people and not a single one regrets this choice. When we arrived at caves (You can get there by car or by public transportation) we were divided in two groups ~10 people in each. The tour was around 3 hours and we had to crawl like worms, slide, climb up/down... We turned of lights and sat in darkness and silence. Amazing :) The caves are really amazing - there are really tiny places which are followed by bigger rooms (like Library, Big room, Theater etc.) so You can experience all kinds of situations.Caving was one of the best and most amazing things I have done in Budapest so far. I have to mention that instructor/guide was very knowledgeable and could answer all questions we asked. He very often offered a choice for us - shortest and easiest or longest and hardest way. If You decide to go, the stick with the hardest choices ;) And he was speaking English really good. I was really surprised when he squeezed trough a hole that looked too small for any human being to get trough. In the end even some people of our group did it too. Only problem could be that you have to book this in advance and the tours are not held every day. If You take camera then make sure that You have where to put it and that it isn't too big, because there is a lot crawling trough tight spaces involved. But I suggest everyone who comes to Budapest go on this adventure. You won't regret it.I will definitely return there and go on another trip to the underground lake.Good luck!"

Our tour guide was very professional, told stories from her caving experiences and was funny. The caves are fascinating and scary at the same time. In most places you can walk or crawl, but some of the wholes are so tiny that it seems impossible to get through - but somehow you still manage it. I'm quite tall guy and got stuck twice for a short period of time, but you just have to keep your calm and move your body centimeter by centimeter.Remember a few things: 1) don't take your expensive shoes with you, because they will surely get dirty2) even it is only +10'c down the caves, you will be sweating A LOT and feeling warm. Wear something light under the caving suit.3) take some (disposable/washable) gloves with you, because there is quite lot wet clay And then to the downside: This tour deserves five stars, even I gave only four to it. The only reason I couldn't give full points to this tour was how it was organized. We met the tour guide and other \"cavers\" in the meeting point as expected. Unfortunately it took ridiculously long time get us in the bus: some people didn't have the bus tickets so we had to wait for them and also it took quite long time for the tour guide to check our reservations. The locals probably will hate us, because we used only public buses and basically took 80% of the space in the bus. When we arrived to the caves they separated us to smaller teams (10 people per team) and again there was a long waiting before we got our suits on."

We thought it will be a good change from sight-seeing and eating which is pretty passive if you ask me. This was probably one of our best experiences in Budapest, and in life! We would never have caved our entire lives if we had not chanced upon this.. Our instructor was Lazslo, and he was such a quirky funny guy. There were about 30-40 other youngsters who registered for the session and we were broken down into 4 groups of 8-9. Once we changed into our overalls and helmets we were led into the pitch black cave. The next 3 hours was one big adventure. We squirmed through holes on our backs with our hands outstretched and heads turned sideways, maneuvered through cracks that had only enough space for one arm and one leg.. climbed up steep walls,slided on our butts down uneven terrains and many more! Our instructor was very spontaneous, diving (literally) into holes and introducing us to the caves at every resting stop. It was alittle bit strenuous on the muscles, though we found it to be an excellent workout. The caves were eye opening. This is really a must-do for everyone visiting Budapest! Be prepared to get dirty. You will be mud coated by the time you're out ;) But trust me, with the kind of terrain you will be moving on, dirt will be the last thing on your mind!

I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is legitimately claustrophobic or very unfit, as I am hurting from the exercise and there are some VERY small spaces to fit through, but if you're just a little nervous but curious DO IT. Easily the most unique experience you can have in Hungary, and it's inexpensive all things considered. It's also a great bonding experience for friends and strangers.Helmets, headlamps, and a onesie/overalls that protects your clothes from cave dust and mud are included.Try to bring boots or athletic shoes if you're going to do this, though, I would not have fallen had I not been wearing converse with no bottom traction."

I happened to chance upon the caving brochure in my hostel, watched a YouTube video on someone caving in budapest and I was sold! And it is 5000huf (approx 17 euros) for 3 hours of fun! We made friends with the other ppl in our group and it was really cool! There were 9 of us to one guide and 3 different groups but we didn't bump into the other groups so not to worry about it being too crowded! It is 10 degrees in the cave all year round but I only wore a tshirt and leggings below the overall and halfway through the cave I was perspiring so don't wear too many layers! Would be useful to have shoes with good grip and it might get muddy so dont wear expensive shoes! You get to squeeze through tiny holes, climb up slippery parts and slide down and the different parts of the cave had quirky names like library, chapel and a bar."

We have been in a lot of limestone caves in Ukraine and Austria, but this cave tour was complete different. No really big chambers, stalagmites and stalactites, but lots of narrow passages, small holes, different cave levels and rock formations covered with clay. All tour participants (a maximum of eight per guide) got an overall, helmet and light, and then we were ready for the adventure. The guide we had was both professional and playful at the same time, and really made our exploration the perfect one. It is possible to buy food and refreshments at the caving bar after the tour."

            "review": "3-hr Caving in Palvolgyi Cave - unforgettable highlight of Budapest. This review is for the 2.5-3hr caving tour where it involves, walking, climbing, crawling. It's not the short 1-hr tour. I also reviewed the 1hr tour at Szeml\u0151hegyi cave (check my reviews page). The Szemlohegyi cave was quite enjoyable, but I enjoyed this tour more as it's a lot more fun and unforgettable. Will recommend this tour if you have time to spare (or do both!).Booked a session for husband and myself. We arrived at the site early - went to level 2 where the guides are, and were told nicely by one of them to wait downstairs for our group to arrive. The meeting point was supposed to be somewhere else where we will take a bus to the cave area but we arranged to meet at the cave directly since we were already in the area in the morning. We sat around the lovely outdoor area and had time for some snacks from the cafe and took in the scenery while waiting for the group to arrive. Once the group arrived, we were split into smaller groups of about 8 people, and were taken up to the locker room to keep our belongings and change into overalls. Then it's a short walk to the entrance of the cave system. The actual caving experience was a lot of fun, and an eye opener for us as it was our first caving experience. There will be a lot of climbing, some sliding, crawling, etc. To be honest, I was a little apprehensive as to whether I can survive the caving tour as I do not exercise regularly. The last 5-10 mins were a little tiring as we did a stretch of almost continuous walking/ climbing, but other than that, there will be frequent stops for you to catch your breath throughout the tour so it's actually pretty manageable. If you are in decent health, I think it shouldn't be a problem. Husband and myself are in our early 30s, normal weight range (a little on the high side!), pretty sedentary lifestyle. We only do proper exercises less than 3 times a year, so we're pretty much in 'vegetating' state for most part of the year, and yes, we survived!!! :DThe guide (Lati? - not sure how to spell) is really nice and patient. Our group had 2 females and 5 males and he made the female go first before the males (he will be in front) so he can assist if needed. If you are claustrophobic or scared of the dark, this tour may not be for you. We heard that a girl from the other group bailed out upon entering the cave. We crawled through a couple of seemingly tight openings you'd never think it was possible and it was quite an adventure for first-timers like myself. I've a short video taken during the caving. It's not a terribly exciting video, I just uploaded to share how the environment was like. You can find it here: http://youtu.be/Dz2RWZQK5JEIn summary, we had a fabulous time and I highly recommend this caving tour if you are in Budapest. It was easily the highlight of our Budapest weekend.Tips:1) You don't need to layer on too much as you will perspire. Just a Tshirt or a long-sleeve top will do.2) Long-hair individuals - bring a hair tie / rubberband.3) Bring a new top to change into after the caving. Can also bring small towel / soap as they have a shower room (no one uses it so please email them to ask if you are allowed to use it, I'm not sure if it's only for the staff or open to visitors as well). 4) You may get the occasional sand/ mud stuck in your nails during the caving. They do not have hand soap in the toilets, so if you are a hygiene freak, bring your own hand soap/ hand sanitizer. 5) Bring a compact camera you don't mind dirtying/ damaging. DSLRs definitely not allowed. You have to be prepared to come out with a dusty camera. You will be moving about most of the time, so won't get to use the camera regularly. Can keep the camera at your overall chest pocket.6) Wear proper shoes with good grip (trekking shoes). Most seem to manage fine with track shoes. They will get a little muddy as some areas are a little wet in the cave, however most areas are dry so not to worry.7) Might be good to keep some wet wipes/ tissue handy in your pocket but do not litter!8) Use the washroom in the locker room before caving. The toilet underneath the cave costs 30 euros to use.... just kidding! There're no toilets in the cave! ;P9) Enjoy a glass of beer at the cafe after the caving. You deserve it!10) If you are going on your own, board the bus 65 from Kolosy Ter (there are multiple bus stops there, so leave enough time to get there/ find bus stop, wait for buses). There is a good free bus app on iPhone where it lists the stops. Search for 'Budapest Transport' on the app store and it's called BpMenetrend devloped by iMind Kft."

            "review": "Annoying start- great overall experience!. We did the intense 3 hour 'climbing-crawling adventure' tour. Definitely one of the more interesting things I've done on a vacation. From what I can tell it is also infinitely better than the 1 hour walking tour of he cave. They do need to make it more obvious on the website how demanding this tour is though. Lots of climbing, crawling, slithering, jumping, sliding, guessing and FUN!! Our guide \"Frodo\" and his companion were great.Advice for tourist: bring good shoes with good grip. Buy a one-day public transport ticket in advance. Once in the caves, don't wear more than a t-shirt underneath your overalls because you will be too hot. If you're claustrophobic, are afraid of the dark or are in relatively poor shape: not for you.Advice for organizers: the meeting point was bus stop no. 206 at 3:45pm. If some people show up late or unprepared (i.e. without bus tickets), that's their fault. Don't make the rest of us waste valuable time waiting for them."

The cashier explained that she would lead the tour as her English-speaking guide was unavailable. While she apologized for her English skills, she had no need to do so -- she was very understandable, and shared wonderful insights along the way as the tour was just my family. We enjoyed our conversation as much as we did the lovely sights of the cave. The tour is well-organized with very modern paths and walkways underground, and the lighting is just right. I would imagine on a hot day this would be a very pleasant escape. Very much worth the time to visit!"

We wanted to book a spelunking tour because my husband and I had done one before and the idea interested the other couple with whom we were traveling. We thought it would not happen because the planned English tour did not work with our schedule--it would end at the same time we were supposed to board an overnight train back to Dresden!But the staff was so accommodating and created a special separate English-language tour for the four of us! Wow! We had so much fun with Orsa and Gabor. Orsa met us at the train station and took us with her on the bus to the caves, as we were a little confused on how to get there (not too hard, but you do need to change buses). She then geared up and geared all of us up in full-length suits with helmets and headlamps, then we hiked across the street to enter the cave! It was very different from my first caving experience, which was in South Dakota--there were less rules and regulations but the cave was also not as exciting. (We had some folk tell us it is not worth it because the cave is so \"boring.\" There are not a lot of geological oddities like stalagmite or stalactite, but there are fossils and crystals.)But the fact that they took in to consideration our needs and abilities made the tour totally worth it! Some of our group took a more challenging course while others took a less challenging course after getting a little tired out. There are some tight spaces and the suits sometimes make it hard to squeeze through--I did get stuck at one point until I was able to pull my suit up to release me (though the skinnier folk in our group had no issues). I really loved this down and dirty tour. It was was a lot of fun and I would recommend it to adventuresome people.Wear shoes that can be easily cleaned or that you don't mind getting dirty and, for women, it is helpful to have both a hair tie and a bandana to wrap around your head before putting on the helmet. You could also maybe bring a pair of tight-fitting gardening gloves for some extra grip. Our guides had on snug-fitting rubber boots, which were excellent for traction and dirt. My hiking boot treads filled with mud and became a little slippery at times.If you are someone with claustrophobia, I would not recommend this wild caving tour. Or if you are someone who is averse to some minor risk-taking/getting outside of your comfort zone. Or someone who does not like to be dirty!!"

            "review": "Highlight of our Budapest visit -- a must for adventure. I will start by saying that I did not want to go on this cave tour. I had promised my teenage son that we would go see the caves, but once I read the other reviews and saw some of the photos of people who had been caving I had a major anxiety attack. I literally could not sleep with worry, and woke up every morning wondering how I was going to manage this. (I am not making this up) - on the morning of the tour, I woke up, remembered watching the film \u00ab 127 hours \u00bb and thought to myself - I must remember to pack my swiss army knife in case I get stuck and have to saw a limb off. All to say, that I was quite nervous. However, I also thought to myself \u2013 am I never going to do anything adventurous ever again ? So I decided to do it. We met at the bus stop at the train station. We already had bought a travel ticket for the week (Can recommend this) so we didn't need to buy additional bus tickets. I was immediately relieved that there was a large group booked in -- all from youth hostels. Apparently the cave tour is very well advertised at the hostels. I was even more relieved when I saw a group of 6 young Japanese tourists in unsuitable footwear - I thought, if these guys can do it, so can I!The caves were about 30 minutes away. Our geoligist/guide (Salid) was friendly, and we discussed mountains & caves across the world. On arrival we changed to overalls and helmets. For footwear, we had bought our hiking boots, but most people had bought trainers with them which were fine. I had thought to bring my i-phone to take pictures but our guide discouraged this (dusty & dark, he said). So if you have a small, old, camera then I'd advise taking this. By the time we arrived at the entrance of the caves, I had built this whole experience up in my mind so much that the actual entrance and descent seemed easy. We entered via a man-made tunnel, then descended a 10m iron ladder into the caves-proper. We were in a group of 15 with one guide. The rules were that you checked the person in front and behind of you and passed on any tips to the person behind. The caves had a kind of \"necklace\" structure. i.e. there would be a tightish spot and then almost immediately you would be out in a more open area. I have to say that I didn't feel at all claustrophobic - to my great surprise. More so, I enjoyed each of the physical challenges. We took our time going round and the guide explained the geology of the caves. Every so often we would get to a spot where there was a choice between an easy route, and a tight tunnel. Here, you had the freedom to try something more challenging (my 14 year old son with his zero sense of danger, and 14 year old hips did everything and more of course). So, many of the super-tight spots images that you see online were actually optional (to my great relief). One last tip - we got out of the caves at about 8:30 pm -- I bought along some water and some crackers as my son was quite hungry by then. So, finally, this was the highlight of our trip to Budapest. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would go again. At 46 years I was by far the oldest in our group (average age 25) and the only \u00ab mum \u00bb of course. I would recommend it to anyone who is not seriously claustrophobic , who enjoys a physical challenge."

The weather was beautiful and Thomas asked us if there were any sights we wanted to see. I had a few requests and he also made some great suggestionstuff of sights we didn't know about. Thomas spoke very good English and was quite knowledgeable about the history of the sights we saw. He is a good responsible driver and had good command of the vehicle. I recommend Thomas and this private Tuk Tuk tour."

The trip was a little over 2 hours and we were able to travel through a majority of the city and see most of the key sites. We were provided adequate time to stop and get out at several of the key attractions and the guides were very friendly and knowledgeable. The TukTuk's fit 2 guests and a driver so we arranged for two since we had a party of 3. They are very mobile so they can navigate through the city easily and are open air. I have a much better appreciation for how beautiful Budapest is after this trip. I highly recommend it."

Tuk Tuk Budapest offered the perfect solution. We decided to get one of their tours and add some extra time, which is nice as you'll get to see more, but you also need to make clear exactly how much you are willing to spend as you may end up enjoying Budapest a lot more than you expected. We had a great driver - Daniel - which took us all over. Gave us great details on all the main sites of Budapest and was more than happy to let us enjoy a bit of extra time at the sites and sounds of Budapest. Definitely a great option for those of you who don't have great mobility and need to limit your walking and still want to be able to be close to everything. Adding the extra time really worked for us. But people on a budget (money or time) should stick to the set schedule."

After scouring the internet for ideas I came across Budapest TukTuk. I had the idea to propose to my girlfriend at the top of Gellert HIlls, after surprising her with a TukTuk ride through the city.I was in contact with a lady called Bori - who could not be more supportive and genuinely excited by my idea. She briefed the driver (Mikkey) excellently and he helped keep it all a surprise.We was picked up from a river cruise and taken to Gellert Hills. I requested a bunch of flowers and champagne for after the proposal. Once I had proposed, Mikkey (the driver) came up and gave me the flowers in such a sly way I felt like James Bond. We then returned to the TukTuk where a bottle of champagne was popped and we continued the tour whilst sipping on the bubbly.Bori was a star in all of this. She was excellent with her communication and any query I had was promptly answered. The night went perfectly and a huge part of this must go to Bori for sharing over 30 emails with me really planned everything to the tee.Mikkey the driver was also fantastic and was briefed really well and kept the whole thing a surprise. Thank you to Mikkey, Budapest TukTuk and off course a huge thank you to Bori!Highly recommended and extremely good value for money. Planning on visiting Budapest on our anniversary and will certainty have another tour!"

To me, Tuk Tuk, conjures up memories of fast and exhilarating rides I have done in lots of Asian Countries like Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia etc. Not here in Hungary...Very subdued as they probably have to be. The overall experience for our 100 minute tour was good. We did suggest where we wanted to go (we have been here before), so our Driver, Miki, was accommodating but not knowledgable of questions we had. Suggest the Company needs more drivers who are not only safe when they drive but also know a bit about their cities history and are familiar with tourism facts for those of us who are interested in this sort of thing."

The benefit of riding on it is that you can go through the paths that those big buses by other companies that cannot go through. It is also amazing that the tuktuk driver really know a lot about the city, and they can introduce to you about all the stories behind the roads/architectures, good places to go on your own, recommendations on places for eating, you can even stop and take the pic with the beautiful background while sitting on the tuktuk. Another benefit is that, whenever you have questions, you can ask the tuktuk driver immediately, and I am sure they will be able to answer you, I guess with the interactions with the driver, it more or less made me feel like i have a private tourist guide."

I am not a tourist bus sort of guy, but after climbing all the way up to the Freedom Tower in the heat, we decided we should maybe reconsider walking all of the way to the Fishermen's bastion. We came upon this tuk-tuk service and called the number. Within 20 minutes Miki, our driver and guide was there. He was incredible and took us all around Budapest, even to some \"secret\" spots with spectacular views and no tourists. He was deeply knowledgable about Hungarian history and appropriately proud of his city. I can't recommend this highly enough. It is a great orientation for a city that can be quite a challenge to navigate. We learned a lot and really liked Miki. It's also an incredible deal at 14 euro per person (plus we added a generous tip)."

We were driven around the cityby Thomas, a young local guy, on a typical TukTuk (a sort of motorbike with enough place to accomodate two people in the rear side). He told us about the history of the monument he took us to and we were amazed to get to know so many details in so short time with him. The tour lasted an hour but we were able to visit the Parliament, the main railway station, the Heros Square, the Opera House and some other attractions on this amazing means of transport. I would definitely recommend to choose Budapest TukTuk to discover the city, since the tour is custom-made and you can choose where to go and what to visit. The driver is at your disposal and you will end up in a bar enjoying a refreshing lemonade (incl. in the price) at the end of the tour. Definitely worth the price (19.00\u20ac). Thank you Thomas!"

I was in Budapest with my wife for three days and we want to see all the major attractions, monuments, and popular sights but with a more personalized approach. We didn't want to do the hop on hop off buses because they can get hot with so many people and they are often too slow. I found Budapest Tuk Tuk on tripadvisor and noticed how personal and accommodating they were, read all the wonderful reviews, and immediately made up my mind to book a tour with them. They responded promptly and picked us up at 9am, the exact time they told us they would be at our apartment. They come directly to your address and pick you up, so convenient! Our tour guide/driver, Bertalan, was so gracious and welcoming. He told us tons of facts and historical information about the city and its landmarks and monuments. Bert was extremely funny and a great tour guide. The Tuk Tuk rickshaw had an open back which allowed us to drive through the city with amazing unobstructed views. Due to its small size we were also able to navigate and maneuver through smaller streets and other great locations that were off limits to the big tour busses. In just about 2 and a half hours my wife and I had seen all the big highlights of Budapest, in comfort and style I might add, and we still had the rest of the afternoon to decide which of the places we had visited we wanted to return to in order to spend more time there. I highly recommend this company and want to personally thank Bertalan for making my wife and I feel like rock stars in Budapest. You get way more than your money's worth with this tour and company and I hope to return one day with friends and relatives and take them on a Budapest Tuk Tuk tour. If you are still reading this, book your tour with Budapest Tuk Tuk now, you won't regret it."

As there were 7 of us, I emailed ahead to ask if this would be a problem because it appeared that the tuk tuks only accommodated two people. They responded promptly and advised that although they do accomodate 2, that we could have 3 in one of them. We found this to be ok and didnt feel squashed at all. The trip was brilliant, such fun as we were in convoy. The drivers explained and pointed out different sights and were knowledgeable about their city. We asked if we could stop off for a drink in a bar and they waited patiently for us whilst we did this. This obviously knocked some time off our tour so we didnt see the castle area but that was our choice and we still felt we had seen loads. At the end of the tour, the driver gives you a voucher to validate for a free boat trip on the Danube. This trip was just amazing. We all agreed that this tour was great value for money, especially when taking into account the hour long boat trip, again which is narrated on audio with a free drink too!

They send a driver/guide to your hotel in the TukTuk, a small 3-wheel golf cart-like vehicle but with more power and speed. For about $55 US you get a 2-1/2 hour spin to some major sites while visiting nice neighborhoods in the Buda side and at the City Park. It's private, just you and the guide, no crowds or jostling on and off buses. Our guide was Gabor, who not only spoke good English but gave us the benefit of local history and geographic insights that made Budapest all the more interesting. He dropped us at the Marina since the price included a one hour boat tour which was also excellent and provided great views of both shorelines while being well narrated by a tape. This is a great overview which we followed up by going back later in the day and next day to visit a few sites we wanted to see more of (using a cool scooter we rented from Scooter Budapest, but that's another review)."

It was not long until the weather threatened so he put the top up. There were blankets in the \"buggy\" but unfortunately they were wet from the rain we experienced. He offered to put the sides on to keep the rain out but we said we were OK (my wife used her umbrella at her side to keep the rain off). I was just fine. Paul drove us all around the city on both sides of the Danube and took us places no other hired transportation would be able to take us.Paul would turn and face us and give us all the information we could (and could not) handle about Budapest.

Every beautiful thing, every interesting thing, Adam introduced us to them all! With more time in the city, we could go back and extend time at any of these places, but we won't have time!!! Even with such a short time, we are delighted to say we have truly SEEN Budapest!. The people of Hungary have engaged in vigorous restoration of beautiful buildings and places that were destroyed during World War II, and neglected under the Soviet control. Never have we seen buildings so beautiful in design - - from various eras of architecture -- and so lovingly maintained. Bright clean, scrubbed or freshly painted - - not sure - - but everything with pride and determination, kept in excellent condition and order. A true gem of a city!! And Tuk Tuk Tours takes that pride and determination on up another notch or two, showing you the entire city - - parks, buildings,monuments, lovely tree-lined streets, all with Adam's gentle, intelligent, knowledgeable comments on history and happenings. What a perfect way to invest our time here!!! This little electric pony cart edges in and out of places where any larger vehicle could not beGIN to go!! As we zipped along, we observed bus-loads of people following guides in groups a block long, to see various and whatever. Lots of staring at us, with clear looks on their faces, wondering how we got THAT!!! I tried really HARD to smile without smug!!!! Such a happy trip!!! We're LOVIN' it!!! Our driver/guide Adam was ALL ABOUT what would be interesting and pleasing to us, helping us love Budapest and Hungary. Well, Adam, THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE IT!!!!!

Adam arrived exactly on time at our central Budapest hotel. After brief introductions and presenting him with our pre-arranged voucher we were on our way.Adam gave us a choice of two possible routes to Margaret Island and after suggesting we would like to enjoy his expertise and allowed him to choose the route. Travelling towards the riverfront route Adam asked if we were at all interested in learning more of the history of the area. We were happy we indicated we were as he was full of little kid-bits of information as to the naming of particular features and structures as well as the sometime good fortune / sometime misfortune of the area being in a desirable location and having desired agricultural and economic features that resulted in many armies battling over the region from the time of the Romans onward.Our tour through Margaret Island was delightful under the shade of many large trees. Adam was extremely receptive to our questions and readily able and willing to quickly search out the english name for a number of tree varieties we had questioned him about. He also gave us time to wander slowly through the region surrounding the musical fountain and were able to obtain a number of beautiful pictures of the impressive trees and gardens surrounding the fascinating fountain. On our way back from the island we travelled the river route on the Buda side of the river and took a side trip through some of the castle district and up to Fisherman's Bastion where we had another opportunity to wander and have a look at the spectacular views of the city from there. Having completed that excursion, Adam asked us for our desired drop-off location and as we had other plans for the afternoon he returned us expeditiously to our hotel where we were picked up.All-in-all, this is probably the best experience we have had in our two separate trips to Budapest; due mainly to the pleasant, polite, and knowledgeable nature and attitude of our Guide. Currently I am unable to walk great distances was I am currently awaiting joint replacement. This tour provided a wonderful opportunity to experience a number of features even with my condition - greatly appreciated!Thank you Adam!"

This was not a problem and my driver, Paul, arrived on time at my hotel. We then proceeded to visit all main areas of both Pest and Buda. Paul was a very well informed and articulate young man, and I was able to learn so much about the early and more recent history of Hungary. I appreciated his politeness and care, and he willing to answer all my questions, often adding an extra insight. It was certainly a great way to travel around the very busy tourist spots, especially in Buda where there were dozens of big buses with hundreds of people, and we were able to move at a pace that suited us both. I can certainly recommend Budapest Tuk Tuk to any visitor who is wishing to have a more personalised service and who wishes to avoid the usual large group tours. Thank you for a most memorable day Paul."

Tamas, Peter and Gabor proved knowledgeable and very helpful guides as well as capable drivers.This is an excellent and fun way for an introduction to Budapest. Oh, and the goulash at 21 was ace!"

We felt like he personalized our tour of Budapest just for us.

We had a wonderful time! Our driver, Thomas, was a personable young man who is a proud ambassador for his city! As soon as we entered, he gave us a blanket as it was a cooler spring night, in fact, the first night of tuk tuk season! We gave us a tablet that was connected to a GPS, and we could visually watch where we were headed on a map of Budapest. At interesting sights where the Thomas stopped there was an audio narrative to correspond with the sight. Thomas gave us additional insight into the city through conversation, took us yo the highest point of the city yo overlook the lighted buildings and bridges and fulfilled a request to get a close up of Parliament! He even took our picture in front of it! For a fun, reasonably inexpensive private tour of Budapest, take the tuk tuk city your at night and ask for Thomas."

Had no idea he was new to the team- was a great and courteous driver and answered our questions about life and culture and drove us around in the sunshine. I booked the tour for myself and my parents, both of whom are in their late 60s, and I'm in my early 30s. While I could explore Budapest from dawn to sunset, they don't always have the energy to walk all day and explore big cities by foot, even though they have the interest. The tuktuk seemed like a great way to see it all and it absolutely was. You don't feel stuck and above/separated from everything like in a tour bus and you cover SO much terrain and see so many sights. It's a very personal experience where you can ask questions and engage, stop and wander and experience the city. It really is the ideal way to travel and I know I will be booking this kind of transportation in any city I travel where it is available. The transportation itself is fantastic and Gabor really made the trip that much more enjoyable :) I am so glad we booked this tour!"

It was fantastic, I strongly, strongly, strongly recommend this!There are two reasons for that: One: My wife loved me for it. It was a wonderful trip. Second: The Budapest Tuktuk Team was great! They gave us an absolutely decent offer, communications with Vivien were fantastic and they actually drove out to G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u00f6, which is a bit of a ride and which must have been fun for the driver.Some more details: The tuktuk was there on time, which I didn't know, but my best man took care of the preparation. Because right after church we were greeted by a tuktuk with many red balloons and a smug driver. We hopped on and he had a playlist of french chansons prepared, which was great for the occasion. We took a wonderful tour and had a great time, enjoying the first minutes of being married.We then reached the \u00e9tterem and while my wife and I had our first champagne, the driver stayed another hour or so, so that the children amongst our guests (yes, there were some very old children) could have a chance to take a little tour in the tuktuk.So thanks again, the tuktuk was an important part of our wedding!!!"

The only thing I can say was a mistake was leaving this for my last day instead of it being my first day activity. Our driver Robert was just amazing..I truly can't say enough about him. He met us at our hotel and was even early. We took the We'll Show You Everything tour- about 2.5-3hrs. Robert asked us what we had already seen and he modified the tour as to not take us to places we had already seen. Robert was a wealth of knowledge and an obvious historian and was always willing and able to answer any questions we had. He took us to a special park and explained the history of Buda and Pest. A very special and personal touch. This is such a more personal tour than the hop on hop off bus tours- and very much worth the money spent. I couldn't recommend this enough to anyone visiting the beautiful city of Budapest. We covered in hours what it would have taken days to do on our own- and was shown lesser known areas of the city that many tourists don't see. From start to finish, Robert treated us with respect and kindness and was really engaging in conversation- He LOVES what he does and it shows. Thank you Robert and TukTuk for making our trip to Budapest so very wonderful and exciting. At this time they have 7 Tuk Tuks and many packages available to suit most needs. (tour was in English)"

The tour (\"Budapest pro\") was set to 150 minutes, just enough to get to see the best spots. Balazs was very helpful and entertaining, and you could feel he enjoyed his job.

We really enjoyed the experience of being driven through the city amongst the traffic as it made us feel apart of it, it also helped us to get an awareness of our location and where other places were that we wanted to visit.Once we drove over the bridge into the Castle Hill area we were able to stop at the Citadel for 15 minutes to get out and look around before Alex took us to Fisherman's Bastion etc, Alex told us loads of interesting facts about the beautiful architecture and we finished at the Piknik Pavillion where our wine and lunch awaited us. It was the perfect tour 90 minutes long which then gave us plenty of time after lunch to visit the Royal Palace and to look round the whole area before catching the Funicular train back down to the bridge.Can not recommend this trip enough we loved it !!"

So was a surprise for him. was great to customize our trip. went to see the lights of the city then took us straight to the restaurant where we booked in advance.

Our local, incredibly knowledgable guide introduced us to Budapest TukTuk as a unique and interesting way to travel around the city. We had a fabulous experience and want to share it with TripAdvisor. We were fortunate to have Attila as our driver and he was just excellent. The small TukTuk car was able to navigate the narrow streets and take us to places we otherwise would not have seen. We engaged Budapest TukTuk get around the city in the daytime, and then we engaged them again to give us a guided tour of the city at night, which was just spectacular. Having a personal, knowledgeable guide, an open air ride, and access to places a bus can't get to is a winning formula, and for a price that's affordable. If you are visiting Budapest, TukTuk is the way to go. And ask for Attila. He's a rock star when it comes to giving a guided tour. Five stars!"

I went over & spoke one of the guys who explained it was a new venture that they had started only 2 weeks earlier. Don't worry these aren't your tuk-tuks with hundreds of personalized lights you see in other counties. They have seat belts, side doors & a cover if necessary.Rather than using the hop-on hop-off bus this seemed a much more personal way of seeing the city & really wasn't expensive (47 euros per tuk-tuk for 1\u00bd hours + a free cocktail in the 360 Bar & they even picked us up from our hotel) The beauty of this attraction is that because the tuk-tuks are classified as motorbikes they can get closer to places the buses can't. If you wanted them to stop you can at any time which you certainly couldn't do on a bus. The two drivers were very friendly, knowledgeable with great grasp of our language, (& many others) which helps.If you want to see the city in a more friendly, personal & fun way use these guys."

Agnes is an extraordinary woman who was extremely knowledgeable on the history of Hungary which tied in perfectly with the food we tried as well as the food she talked to us about at the market. We tried a wide array of delicious food which I think was a total of 8 different food items. The first item was a fresh biscuit that was homemade and fantastic. She was really helpful to our needs by asking if we had any dietary restrictions and allowing us to choose from types of chocolates, spritzers, & pastries. She also, called us a cab for our spa appointment as well as recommended some great places & music to check out. Finally, she had sent us a follow up email with her goulash recipe that I am looking forward to trying.

It was all delicious and informative and thoroughly enjoyable. Even on a hot day, but be sure to bring an empty stomach and good walking shoes! The only thing that could have made it slightly better was to have something like to quiet boxes they use for walking tours on cruise ships as sometimes we were all strung along the sidewalk and it was hard to hear if you were near the back and she was talking, though usually we were all together when she did speak."

It was a great way to learn about the history of Budapest while sampling the local cuisine. There is a lot of ground covered, food included, and stories shared about the country and culture. Livia also took us to places we never would have found on our own and she gave us some great recommendations for the rest of our stay in Budapest. This tour is definitely worth it. Make sure you go hungry!"

We started in the Central Market and my only criticism was that we spent too long in the Market. Once we got out on the streets the tour became far more interesting! The mixture of food, history and sightseeing was perfect. A warning- the food is substantial, so have a good breakfast and do not eat until you get on the tour. We started right away with delicious salami and sausage in the Market, then on the other stops we had fish, chocolate, matzo ball soup in the Jewish Quarter, wine, and by the time we got to the goulash and strudel we were stuffed, since we had had a light lunch before starting. Agnes was knowledgable about all things Hungarian and gave us a good deal of recent history as well as insights into the lives of the people. Such an improvement on the usual walking tour filled with ancient history which you can only absorb a small part of. Highly recommend!"

We sampled a number of different wines in different bars (from classy wine bars full of locals, to an iconic ruin pub full of backpackers, and back again), as well as some sweet and savoury local bar snacks. The tour winds through an historic and lively part of the city, and between locations Livia gave a history of the area, and spoke engagingly about Hungary in general, and Budapest in particular. I have often wasted hours trudging round cities looking for the right bar/restaurant, and I only had four nights in Budapest. Going on this tour on my first night gave me an instant short-list of bars to return to, and I was able to familiarise myself with the area for a few hours with a local. This is my second UA trip this year after Istanbul, and my second 5-star review."

Although her choices of \"sights and bites\" were amazing, her vast knowledge and pride in her city made the tour a must experience when visiting this city. Her enthusiasm for all the city offered was contagious. She connected each food sampling to the city's unique history and charm. As we walked from sight to sight (do wear comfortable walking shoes) she pointed out architecture, unique shops, quaint hidden courtyards, the history of different neighborhoods, and told local legends based on the culture represented by both the food we sampled and the highlighted sights we visited. We felt comfortable asking questions and found her perspective and insight when answering them well worth the tour. Food sampling included a variety of salami meats, goulash soups, best chocolates ever, strudel, fish delicacies, and Hungarian wine. No need for lunch prior to tour! She ended by giving us a helpful map with our day's route marked so returning to any restaurants would be easy. Two thumbs up for this tour - especially with Agnes."

The restaurants varied from the relatively basic to the final restaurant which felt like a very high class strudel house where you could see strudel being made. The food sampling was interspersed with talks about Hungarian history set in the context of the various parts of the city the the tour visited. There were 7 people on the tour, which we understood was fairly typical, so plenty of time to ask questions. Possibly not the cheapest thing to do in Budapest but an excellent way to orientate yourself with the city, its food and history."

The food that we got to experience on the tour was phenomenal as well. We started with a walk through Market Hall and sampled a variety of Hungarian salamis. Then we moved on to walk around the area, learning about the history and sampling food from other restaurants. Everything was fantastic, but a real highlight for me was having the motsa soup at a Kosher restaurant. That was a completely new experience for me.

The guides (Livia and Agnes) were fantastic. After each tour I had learned a lot, had had a really good time and felt a little bit more at home in Budapest, as you get to see places you might not find on your own. Would highly recommend this organization to anybody."

We had booked an urban adventure food tour to experience Hungarian food and an insight into their culture. Our guide was Livia who spent the next four hours taking us all around Budapest. This was an unforgettable experience made all the more special by Livia's accounts of Hungarian life and cuisine. Our children, aged 12 and 15 enjoyed this experience as well and listened intently to Livia's stories of life in Budapest. At the end of this tour we all felt like we had a better understanding of the rich life that Budapest has for its people. We also had better knowledge of the history of Hungary and Budapest over the last fifty years. This was a great way to experience a country and city that made the visit all the more special."

My husband and I took the Bites & Sights tour with Livia in October 2013 and we could not recommend it more highly! We did not book a private tour, but it turned out that we were the only ones who had booked. Not only did Livia not cancel, she ended up giving us a private tour with all of the enthusiasm one would think would be reserved for a VIP group. We met at the Central Market and wandered, sipped and nibbled through its various stalls. We then noshed through the Jewish quarter and through some of the rehabilitated districts of the city, stopping at a bunch of cool shops (including a sophisticated chocolate shop) and several fun restaurants along the way (loved this awesome joint called Fish Rooster that had its own backstory). Livia explained how Budapest was still clawing its way back to greatness after the end of the Soviet occupation, as evidenced by the shiny brand new buildings surrounding crumbling, but still stunning, baroque ones. Our favourite stops were the Ruin Bars she took us. I guess it started with an ingenious response by a group of students to the government's call for entrepreneurs to purchase and renovate the city's many derelict grand old buildings. Livia explained that this group of students bought a building, but instead of renovating it, they decided to use the building as a sort of underground student bar and left it as-is in its ruinous state - hence, \"Ruin Bar\". Livia showed us a bunch of these and we loved all of them. It was really fun to roam the city with Livia. I was like visiting a city with your cool, hip local cousin who knew all of the best spots in town. She was energetic and enthusiastic; knowledgeable and informative. Best of all, she was passionate about her city and keen to make sure we appreciated it, which we did. We highly recommend this tour."

We found the history and anecdotes shared as we walked around some lesser known parts of Budapest totally enthralling, add in the food sampling, which overall became a substantial meal, and it is the perfect way to truly explore Budapest. We sampled, soups, fish, salami and strudel to name but a few, all supplied as part of the package. Although circa 3 hours, the time flew by and the walking speed was comfortable. Budapest is not huge and there are no hills on this tour, so do not be concerned if you are not athletic, my wife and I are both in our sixties and found the whole thing delightful. Special thanks to Livia as her passion and knowledge of her city made our holiday really memorable."

I myself learned a tremendous amount about the city and discovered some new places I didn't even know existed - and I consider myself a local at this point! Our guide, Eniko, was warm and enthusiastic from our initial call until the very end of the trip. The tour itself was well planned and it was lovely to eat a little, walk a little, nosh a little, walk a little, etc. The types of foods were extremely varied and it is clear that she really knows a lot about the history of Budapest and enjoyed sharing her knowledge with us. After the tour, Eniko took her own time to chat with us and recommend some activities off the beaten path for the rest of our trip. It was an excellent experience and really enhanced our trip. We were left with a fantastic impression of the city and Eniko truly is an excellent ambassador. I sincerely recommend this tour, it was a wonderful way to spend an afternoon and an excellent introduction to the city and its cuisine."

I'm somewhat hesitant to endorse these two walking tours so wholeheartedly in case it helps spread the word too much and results in the tours losing their very personal qualities - at the heart of their success. For me, anyway...I did both \"Bites and Sights\" (with Andrea) and \"Budapest Explorer\" (with Livia): the former along with one other guest, the second on my own. On both trips, it was like exploring the city with a local friend rather than a guide. Both guides gave so much information with such clear enthusiasm that I definitely gained far more than I would have done from one of the (I suspect) huge \"free walking tours\" on offer in the city - or the \"Hop-on Hop-Off Bus tour.On \"Bites and Sights\" it was a great opportunity not only to sample some of Hungary's specialities - from goulash soup, a Jewish soup, Spreitzer & different salamis to fish dishes, chocolates & freshly based strudels etc. - but also to visit some of Budapest's quirky cafes and restaurants (not to mention a 'ruin pub' and chocolate shop) and see some sights including the Central Market, the synagogue and a Serbian church.On \"Budapest Explorer\" I visited a local's home in one of the flats surrounding a hidden courtyard, an historical bookshop caf\u00e9 as well as better known sights such as St. Stephen's Basilica, Chain Bridge and Heroes Square (via the second oldest metro line in the world). When visiting one of the old four markets of the late 19th century, I had the chance to sample another Hungarian speciality: Langos (a rather big snack!). As with Andrea on my first tour, Livia gave lots of personal anecdotes en route which made for another amazing experience.Cannot recommend both trips highly enough!!"

It was definitely one of the best highlights of our time in Budapest. Not only did we get to try some great food but we learned so much more about the history of Budapest while we were on the tour. I highly recommend the tour and Livia was a wonderful guide!!!"

The tour guide Livia was fun, energetic, and exceptionally knowledgeable. She absolutely went out of her way to not only let us sample the local foods, but to understand why they were a part of Hungarian culture. Her English is remarkably good too, making the information very easy to absorb. She led us away from the major tourist spots and allowed us to sample a bit of 'real' Budapest. Do this tour while you're in Budapest, I cannot speak highly enough of it!"

It turned out to be closer to five and every moment was a pleasure. We made frequent stops at interesting sights, restaurants, and bars. We ate small bits all along the way. Livia was lovely and very knowledgeable. She spoke of the complex history of this city that has seen so much change over it's lifetime. She made it more real with experiences and stories passed to her by her grandparents. The time flew by. I've been fortunate to have taken city tours in other European countries - this was, by far, the best ever. I give Livia and her well planned and executed tour an unqualified endorsement."

What a great way to get your bearings in the beautiful city of Budapest and get a full belly of beautiful food at the same time!! Livia is a fantastic guide and shows you around much of the Pest side of the city on this food-based walking tour. As many other reviewers have mentioned, it takes in different food specialities from the matzos soup in the Jewish quarter to Froccs (Spritzer to you and me but don't mention it to a Hungarian!) on the rooftop bar, to the almost compulsory Goulash and Strudel. What really makes the tour great though is Livia's knowledge and personaliuty; within half an hour of starting the tour we felt like we were simply wandering around a new city with an old friend who was showing us around. Can't recommend highly enough, and if you do this trip early in your stay in Budapest it'll give you a great sense of place and allow you to get your bearings to navigate your own way around once Livia has gone!!"

The Explorer tour took us to places we would not have seen as ordinary tourists....eg. places where SS took over for their own purposes, several different 'ruin' bars, the oldest coffee shop in Budapest! Plus heaps more. As a student of architecture, Livia shared many anecdotes of Budapest and Hungary's history. A tour well worth doing."

I found the ruin bars fascinating and enjoyed a roof top bar and a great view. Loved the introduction to popular Hungarian summer time drink \"Maci Froccs\" Then we went to the Jewish quarter for matza soup. We stopped at the temple graveyard and saw the graves with so many dated1945 the effect of the harsh treatment of the Jewish quarter during World War 2. Then we stopped at a chocolate store to taste hand made chocolate. The last stop was a traditional restaurant for goulash and strudel.

We had booked the cruise with drinks and took the advise to get there early to get good seats at the front of the boat. We were sat down from 6.15 for the 6.30 cruise which actually didn't set off until about 6.45pm. All started well when the staff started at the front of the boat taking orders for drinks. We gave our order and waited for the drinks to be served. To our disappointment the girl brought a big tray of drinks out and started at the front giving out drinks. We were missed out but waited on thinking ours would be on the next tray. The waitress then served another tray of drinks again we were missed out. By this time most people around us had finished their drinks. Therefore I decided to go and ask about our drinks (consequently missing out on the audio tour for that section) when I enquiries about the drinks the member of staff who was filling another tray of drinks snapped at me that we never ordered any drinks. I replied that we did and instead of an apology she told me that she had to serve the other customers and I would have to wait. I was shocked at the abruptness and rudeness in which she spoke to me. In utter shock I walked back to my seat. Another staff member then came and again asked us for our order. The whole situation left us with huge disappointment particularly as we had got there so early and invested our time on the trip. I can also add that this trip is about 18\u20ac each and there are other boats that charge \u20ac9 each. We thought we were paying he extra for the best but obviously not."

The overall presentation was great, and I learned a lot. Plus, the views at night of the major buildings along the Danube can't be beat. The boat I was in had 1 level of seating with 4-5 seats across on each side. Thankfully, it wasn't too crowded, but had it been, I think this would have impacted the ambiance and viewing from the boat. There was another boat with 2 levels and only 2 seats on either side. I would have preferred this, but again, all in all my Legenda experience was lovely. I'm glad I went at night as the views were a bit more dramatic than the daytime. However, I would suggest to put the headphones on right away as once the boat gets moving the presentation starts without any warning from the hosts. I would definitely suggest taking a cruise on Legenda!"

We were seated inside a covered boat (transparent), so it was warm and comfortable inside. We were provide with multi-language audio guide headsets which talked to us about history and stories of all the wonderful sights of Budapest on either side of the Danube river. This was in tandem with a video on screen (there are multiple of these screens and is visible from all seats on the boat). Budapest looks really magnificent in the evening with all the lights and reflections on Danube, and the little history and stories that the tour offers is just the perfect icing on the cake. It is one of the most amazing ways to spend an evening in the \"Pearl of Danube\" with your loved one."

All the better to see the lights of the city at night! [This was a viewing-only tour, you could book for dinner as well but that is earlier in the evening.]We arrived about 15 minutes before the departure time, meaning we were in the front part of the boarding queue to get good seats. The seats on the back of the boat in the open air seem to be the best - no glare on the windows interrupting the view (or the camera lens). The company is thoughtful and provides blankets to borrow to keep you warm if you sit outside. The inside is toasty, so either way you should be comfortable. The staff were nice, accepting our mobile tickets with no problems, and were attentive. The ticket price includes one free drink (alcoholic or soft) including champagne, which added a classy touch.Seeing the city at night was amazing, couldn't fault the views - stunning! You go down the river a ways, come back up and further along, then back down to the mooring point. All in all it took about an hour.There were only a couple of things that dropped a star off the rating for this trip:1) Be prepared for other passengers getting in the way of the view. This is worse if you're sitting on the aisle seat. But if it's the view on the other side that they're obscuring, remember it will be there on the way back and your view at that point should be unobstructed.2) The television on board is very annoying. Like most tour ships they have headphones with information describing, in very flowery language, what you're seeing as you're going along (we found this annoying too but it was at least expected) but this ship also had a large television, partly obscuring the view, showing you pictures...of what is going by past your eyes. Seems daft!Ultimately, would definitely recommend going on this trip to see more of the city, just a couple points knocking it down a star, otherwise it would be 5."

We selected the last daytime tour which was at 18:30, and as a result we were able to watch the sun set during the cruise, as well as see all the lights turned on the buildings after sunset. The evening tours are about $5-$6 more and take a slightly different route. But if you take an earlier daytime cruise, you can get dropped off at Margaret Island and spend 1 1/2 hours in the park setting, and if you have your bathing suit, use the thermal baths. We chose not to take the dinner cruise since we are particular about what we eat, and did not want limited selections. Our hotel recommended this cruise operator, and we were very satisfied. You get one drink, either alcoholic or not, shortly after the boat leaves the dock, and about a half hour later, you get a lemonade, all included in the price. Blankets are available if you feel chilly, but you will have to ask for them. After a 2-week trip covering 3 countries, we chose this cruise as a wonderfully relaxing activity before leaving for home."

The Legenda evening cruise consistent of a nice welcome drink (sparkling wine, wine, beer, soda) with table service. The cruise was an hour and during the cruise they had a movie with information playing on the tv screen in multiple languages (even Dutch, Thai and South Korean available). The cruise lasted for an hour and costed around \u20ac 15,-- including the welcome drink.Tip: we stayed on the top deck which was great. They did have blankets since it was cold. So dress up warmly and go outside on the top deck to enjoy the view from the Danube in the evening."

I understand to do 4 courses of food for the whole boat they need the time, but it did begin to drag on after about 1.5 hours as you take the same loop twice (see each sight 4 times essentially).

We chose a la carte, and everything we had was very delicious - quite amazing since we were expecting microwaved yucky stuff! I liked that every step was organized well - you enter the boat when invited and someone shows you to your table so there is no free-for-all, and all the tables are in a good position to see the shoreline. The staff tries very hard to be friendly and accommodating. All in all a very pleasant evening and well worth the price."

Was probably a 12 x 6 foot space. Had to hang with the smokers, which also sucked. What kind of cruise doesnt have a place to sit or walk on deck outside!?! The crusiee was up the pretty part of danube....they went up and down same section two or three times. It is very beautiful, but i was envious of the other open boats where you could walk around....cannot recommend this at all....pick another line that has a normal boat. And it was 2.5 hours.

We would have partaken of the dinner cruise but she was worried about garlic in the food.Anyway, this really is the best way to view the city and appreciate another aspect to the iconic buildings that stand the test during daylight but at night really highlight the romantic nature of Budapest.We started the tour on the narrow top deck for the best view. There are headphones that describe the sights in many languages but we didn't bother, the view was enough for us and we just marvelled at it, particularly the Parliament building.As the Queen of Summer had recently slipped South, it was a bit chilly up top for Mrs MMMM and so we ventured downstairs once the complimentary drink was served. Though enclosed, you still get an excellent view with the bonus of it being nice and toasty if you tend to be nesh.The crew are friendly and you don't get any sense of them going through the motions with the tourists, they must do the tour several times a day and so it is nice that they were still smiling.The crew member serving our drinks remembered everyone's drink without writing it down. I wish I had a memory like that.This trip really is a must do. It was also gratifying to actually see a river in use, not just the tour boats but river barges too.We will probably do this trip again but in the heart of Winter."

Many of our group did, we were given the choice of a la carte or set menu. We, unlike everyone else, went a la carte. I think that's what made the difference. While they were seated on the fairly crowded lower deck, we were shown up a little spiral staircase to an observation deck with four tables for four couples. A wonderfully romantic setting.We cast off, ordered our food and wine, it all arrived in good time and was beautifully presented. We were captive diners for the three hour cruise so there was no rush. The slowly passing lights of Budapest were all that you would expect. There was a live blues band on board, just two guys, put they were good with a great Brit/American repertoire. They were playing our sorta music and playing it well.I asked the waitress if they did requests, whether they had a selection of songs that they knew that we could look at. She went to find out and, next thing, the singer was stood by our table shaking my hand. I was a pleasantly surprised and asked \"Do you know Black Magic Woman ..... for my wife?\" - \"Of course, of course\" Wow, this was brilliant. I pushed my luck. \"...and Redhouse?\" - \"Yes, certainly.\"The sweet arrived, another bottle of wine please. Good to his word the band played both of my requests during the second half and absolutely nailed them both. The food and service were great, the setting perfect and the band the icing on the cake. Arguably our most romantic meal after over forty years married. Remember to go a la carte. And when we got home and checked our credit card it had all cost us about \u00a330!! Could it get any better?"

We booked six exclusive dinner tickets for the Saturday evening cruise.It was our main event during our ladies' long weekend in Budapest, and it was amazing.The evening started with a glass of champagne, or wine, followed a four course meal. There were lots of different meals chosen, and everyone was happy with their choice and the quality of the food.There was a musician playing quiet jazz music, which allowed us to chat, have fun and enjoy the scenery.All in all, it was a good evening. Highly recommended."

They have what appear to be 3 boats of which one was fitted out for their Dinner cruise (book early for this one as they sellout quick, we missed out on this). We were on the older one of the fleet with limited outside seating. Majority on the upper level was covered but they had an open view to the outside as the glass panels were drawn back. Their other boat for sightseeing had the entire upper level open but I guess it depends on your own personal preference. The electronic guide system is informative and clear. I was impressed with the number of languages available. Embarking and disembarking was well organized. The washroom at the ticket office location was small but very clean. I would recommend Legenda. We went with the recommendation made by the hotel we were staying at the Boscolo Budapest and weren't dissapointed."

The only drawback was the singer, who was off key the entire time, and looked like she'd just broken up with her boyfriend or something -- a pasted-on smile when she remembered it. For what they're charging, can't they get a decent singer?"

Down stairs was looking quite full and I was a bit worried about where we would be seated but to my surprise we were taken upstairs! It was only tables of 2, and very narrow so each table had a window seat! We were given our arrival champagne and ordered food! I advised I needed gluten free and that wasn't an issue! They even supplied gluten free bread with no pre warning which was a really nice surprise!! Overall the food was all good!! Up till the river cruise I hadn't experienced any good service at all in Budapest so didn't have high hopes but no, the waitresses were so attentive, polite and just wanted to do anything they could to help you! The views are just wow! There is nothing more beautiful than Budapest at night!! It is a little expensive at about \u00a355 each for the all inclusive which doesn't include drinks! But the views and overall experience make up for it! If you want something special to remember your Budapest trip you can't miss out on this! Highlight of our trip!"

They provide guiding in dozens of languages, but it is hard to come around the fact that much of the text is less than relevant for foreigners. Often it is not contextualized, therefore it must be hard to understand the true meaning, the historical references.

The boat is very comfortable and was not too crowded, I was able to easily get a seat with a view. The audio guide is informative and is in many languages, and the tour takes you all the way down the Danube and then back up again, one of the highlights being Parliament all lit up.The only downside was some noisy women behind me loudly complaining about how grainy their pictures were but hey ho, life goes on! :')Even if it is a hot days during the day, you will want a jacket or another layer as it was very cold on the water! The staff can give you some very warm and very large blankets on request which were just lovely. Overall I would absolutely recommend Legenda boat tours over any of the cheaper options you might see, it was worth every Forint!"

Other reviewers have said that the food was excellent but unfortunately we did not agree on this evening. I had pork which was very dry and my friend had the steak which was very tough. We enjoyed the dessert though. Wine is priced very reasonably. The cruise itself was fab and especially seeing all the land marks beautifully lit up. The live entertainment (a duo) was very good, heard through the speakers on the top deck, but not at all intrusive. Blankets are provided for the evening chill, which was very welcome. The glass 'cover' can be accessed by staff, either for a couple, or everyone, if it is too cold or raining. We braved it without!

The previous cruise's passengers were still getting off at the same time as our group was trying to get on, which caused confusion and uncertainty. even the young ladies supposedly \"organizing\" the entering and leaving passengers on the gangway seemed uncertain as to when they could start permitting the new passengers on, since some of the previous ones were still milling about in the downstairs part of the boat. Maybe they should leave a bit more time between one cruise and another, or hustle the previous passengers off a little quicker, but they need to work on this. My younger son and I sat in the lower portion of the boat because at first we didn't realize there was an upstairs, but my other son shot upstairs immediately and got a great seat right on the edge of the boat and said it was much better than the seats downstairs.

On a hot evening, the outside top deck was lovely compared to downstairs inside, but people with mobility issues struggled with the tight stairs. The food was good quality. The duck breast with cherries was fabulous. The brownie desert less so but I was full by then anyway. Yes, as other reviews we read before booking pointed out, the boat does circuit a few times up and down the river but who wants to be away from the lights of the city on a dark river? It was romantic and lovely. Recommended"

I made reservations online in 2 minutes, very simple and safe.I chose Legend Cruise Danube, at 21.30 in the night when the sun is down after the Gellert hill. If you have the Budapesta card, you have a 20 % discount of basic price.Route was exactly like the one posted on the official site: from the Margaret Bridge to the Petofi bridge.Therefore you can admire Buda as well Pesta , the historic buildings or new , beautifully lighted .You can listen fascinating commentary plus a film about history of the city, with Audio Guide in 30 languages . You also get a free drink during the ride.Every moment was excellent....Congratulations, highly recommend !"

This is a well organised and well presented operation, from booking, greeting before the cruise, the cruise itself, the professionalism of the staff and the quality of the vessels. As a result, we had a lovely late-afternoon cruise on the Danube.We booked online (which worked well but could be better optimised for mobile) and arrived at the pier 20 minutes later where they, of course, had our booking. We waited to board in a bright, airy and comfortable lounge.The boat was very clean and obviously well maintained. There was an audio commentary you listen to via headsets available at each seat which was informative and well produced, and also means that you can choose to have a quiet, uninterrupted cruise too if that's your thing.The staff served a choose of champagne, beer, wine, etc on the first part of the one hour cruise. Like many others, we chose to be dropped off at Saint Margaret's island which gave the opportunity to explore there (it's very beautiful), to be picked up by a subsequent cruiser for return to the city - with lemonade served on that last section. The staff throughout were friendly, very pleasant and spoke English, Hungarian, German, French, Italian and Japanese. All in all, a great experience."

Commentary in many languages via headphone with easy language selection. Staff professional and friendly, and boats in good order. Informative trip helping you to understand the history of the city of two halves. Beautiful views and great photo opportunities. Think it was around E13 with a small discount for students. We were a bit confused about how to get down to the river side from the walkway at the top, as theres a rail track in between, obvious when you know how, look for the subway style stairs at regular intervals along the pedestrian walkway, and you go down under the track! Oh and you can stop at the Island in the middle and get a later return back, it looks like a holiday island with lots of parks and walks, bike hire etc, I think theres a complex of pools there too, but we didn't as we had a dinner reservation! Looked like it would be fun with younger children."

It was night time and all the lights of the city makes the view magical so i'd recommend doing this at night. There is a headphone for each person and it tells about the architecture of the city, it has many language options so you can probably listen this in your native language. The headphones weren't mobile. This is my only complaint. You can't take them upstairs so feeling the wind and listening about the city is not an option."

The boat first went south, then turned and went north, then turned back.There is an audio tour and monitor that tells you about what you are near to. I don't think I looked at the screen once, but did hear the audio as I was snapping photos.Tips:- book early and online. You'll get emailed a PDF for your tickets- if you want to see the lights, get an early evening cruise that coincides with sunset like we did- take a light jacket; it can be windy and cool- arrive early and sit on top. It'll be easier to see both sides, as it's one seat on each side.- fully charge your camera or phone and take plenty of photos- if a day cruise, take sunscreenThe city and some of these buildings pay a decent electric bill given the impressive lights seen at night.They served a beverage to all (this was a non-dinner cruise) consisting of beer, red or white wine, and/or mineral water.I'd definitely do this again when I'm back in the city. It was a blast, and felt pretty short at 1 hour despite the distance covered"

Most people spoke English, and between that and our limited hungarian, we were off to the races.Also have to add that we had low expectations regarding the wine - we expected, like all other tours where they have a captive audience, that wine would be expensive, and bad. Well, again, Legenda did not disappoint - a very nice rosee was had for a very decent price.We will do this again, and would highly recommend it."

I came aboard, greeted by the staff who were extremely welcoming and checked me in ( I advise pre-booking especially in high season because of the limited spaces and unlike a restaurant you wouldn't get the same movement of bodies being on a boat to free up space!) . Pleasant smiles from all I was shown to a seating area which was comfy and smart.Fairly quickly I was shown to my seat on what looked like a really swish boat. Mirrored ceilings and good decor gave an ambience suited to a relaxed fine dining experience. So far so good. Very quickly I was presented with options for a drink - champagne of course! The menu looked pleasing, I chose a salad to start, soup, steak rare, and a choc cheesecake with fruit sauce. The trip lasted 3 hours which I was surprised at as I thought I may be less. Within the this time we floated up and down the Danube 2.5 times. Budapest I have found to be spectacular, but by night on the river it took my breath away. Each building seems to dress up for the show the parliament building being the most beautiful in my opinion. The Legenda glided up and down smoothly and presented many sightseeing options. I cannot fault the staff, I had a host linked to me and she was excellent. Regularly checked up on me, swiftly took my orders and cleaned up each course. Was watchful for when I needed a refill or something else. Service because you were on a boat and I am guessing meals cooked in segments ( start, main etc) were at times a little slow but the view was distracting. Other than this very small point, I was massively impressed. I was even offered a blanket as I got a little cold! I went for the full package which included drink as starter, trip and 4 courses. This cost 18600 ft. I felt this was worth the cost ten fold.food was excellent well cooked and presented, the venue, experience and service just brill. Highly recommend for a special trip solo, with friends or romantic couples."

With commentary on sights passed for both Buda and Pest, the boat first heads down stream then turns to go upstream until the delightful Margaret Island where there is the option (except for the final non-dining departure) to jump off and explore the island for 90 minutes before resuming the second leg of the tour on the next boat's arrival.The first leg takes around 45 minutes, the return, without commentary, takes just 20 mins back to the centre. A drink is offered on the outward leg (choice of beer, wine, OJ) and lemonade is offered on the return. All the young staff are friendly and polite (and multilingual). Very reasonably priced half day out. The Budapest Card get a 20% discount."

The staff are lovely and speak excellent English. The boat is lovely and clean. The price is very competitive and in my view these boats look the nicest, most modern from what there is on offer, which is why we chose to go with them for the second time. We were not disappointed. The little waiting area before you board is great - nice comfy sofas with free wifi. The wifi on board did not work for me but then again who wants to be surfing the net when there are such beautiful views to be seen! During the trip we got two drinks, one was a choice of wine, beer, soft drink, champagne and on the return leg you get a Legenda lemonade. The toilet facility was nice and clean and so was all the rest of the boat. You have commentary from individual headsets attached to your seats and can choose from a number of languages. It is a good commentary - perhaps a little less than what I would expect if I compare them to say trips in London but nonetheless informative and definitely not too short. I just love finding out all there is about everything so maybe a bit more would have been better.I would whole heartedly recommend this trip (which lasts an hour) and would go as far as saying it is a must for anyone visiting Budapest. The boat was covered with open sides so would also be fine on a wet day."

It could not have been more magical. 2.5 hours on the boat in the evening meant we got to watch the sunset and all the lights coming on at Parliament and the bridges. It had been a very hot day, but the evening was pleasant with breezes. There were plenty of photo opportunities. The music was American jazz and the musicians were very good though I might have preferred Hungarian music, but at least it was not too loud and pleasant. The food was surprisingly delicious and I am a foodie! We went with the preset pricing option and were very glad we did that instead of ala carte. So glad we chose to do this!"

The top level was quickly filled and we grabbed seats below either side is fine as the boat circles the the river, but I would seat to the right side.The audio head sets work just fine and the video they play on board is spoken from the personified voice of the Danube river providing the history of the city. I was awed by the views right from the get go, but be prepared to be wowed by the night time view of the parliament building. I would recommend the night tour by far. The historic buildings lit up at night are majestic. Oh and you get one free beverage. The beer was good too."

Although I am sure the day tour is awesome as well, I definitely recommend doing it at night; everything looked stunningly beautiful!The staff was very friendly and professional. Instructions were given in many languages, not just English, which was probably very helpful to a lot of the passengers.The ticket price includes a drink. I had an excellent glass of champagne, which combined with the breathtaking views from the boat made for an unforgettable memory.Also included in your ticket is an audioguide. I thought the tour had the perfect amount of information; not so much as to be overwhelming, but enought to keep you interested and make you feel like you learned something. It is also narrated by the Danube, which I thought was a neat idea that made it different from other audiotours.Whether you are in Budapest for a day or a week, this is a quick yet beautiful and efficient way to see the main sights in Budapest and I highly recommend it!"

We took the 8.15pm cruise, which was absolutely perfect for watching the sunset over the Danube (at the end of July) and seeing the sights both in daylight and at night. I would definitely recommend the 8.15pm one also because there was enough space for everyone to get good seats and no one had to queue up. The later cruises seemed to be absolutely packed with at least 50 people waiting in line to get decent seats.Gave 4 stars instead of 5 as it was at times difficult to figure out which building the audio narration was about - the TV screens could have been better utilised for this."

There was a live band singing songs and the excursion took about 2.5 hours.The meal served was delicious, 4 courses and the pace was very leisurely so no need to hurry. It is a lovely experience and well worth the price, The upper deck was mainly couples (probably because of the width of the boat being narrower here than downstairs.

The weather was great and the atmosphere on the boat was, because it was a night cruise, romantic. You were able to open the windows and a small area to sit outside completely. It would've been nicer to have a bigger space so that more people could sit outside. What I didn't like was that all the information about the city came from an audio tape and you had to listen to it with earphones. I did the tour with my boyfriend and it would've been nice to talk about the things you see which was a little hard to do while having to listen to the information via earphones. (It kind of killed the romantic atmosphere.) They also played a film about the sights of the city during the tour which was rather distracting and (in my opinion) not needed. All in all the tour offers a nice nighttime tour of the city, but there might be better once as well."

The riverside is stunning (especially at night), and enjoying it with a glass of champagne on a boat is a fun addition to walking among the buildings of Budapest. Unfortunately the experience is marred by the presence of some giant television sets that run some pre-recorded guide/presentation with crummy dialogue. We ended up discarding the headsets and walking upstairs, outside, where an otherwise perfect 360 view of the city around is was interrupted by another one of these television sets mounted directly in the front of the boat - blocking the view ahead and up the river. The trip didn't suffer much from this (you're going to look to the sides most of the time anyway), but how I wish those flat screens were just scrapped so that we could see the city uninterrupted."

My wife and I did two trips with Legenda whist in Budapest last week, one during the day, and that being very good we decided to do another one with the same company at 21:30 when the buildings along the Danube are magnificently illuminated. Having looked along the river at all the companies offering sightseeing boat trips we decided to go with Legenda and we made a great choice. The trips are very well organised, you can pay on the day at the ticket booth next to the boats, they offer complimentary drinks, including a choice of champagne, wine, beer, soft drinks or water. The commentary is provided by recording in various languages, you just choose which you want. The staff on these boats are very courteous and helpful. All in all you'd not be disappointed if you choose to see the river with Legenda. And if you do want to do a trip along the Danube and do it during the day, do it after dark too, the sights are stunning! A really memorable time. N&G L"

Tours depart from dock 7 near the Marriott Hotel and run for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Guides are very professional, efficient, and courteous. Audio tour is given in 30 languages and is quite comprehensive. After leaving the dock, boats travel down just beyond the Liberty Bridge then turn around. Sites along the way include Castle Hill, Matthias Church, Fishermen's Bastion, Parliament, and the Chain Bridge. Boat circles Margaret Island and actually allows those guests who want to get off and visit the island to do so. During the tour you are given 1 glass of wine/champagne/beer/soft drink or mineral water and then later on a glass of lemonade. The drinks were actually served in glasses (vice paper/plastic cups and were very good. Highly recommend this tour to everyone."

I signed up for an evening cruise (not dinner, just the cruise) on the Danube - about $20. I waited until late in the afternoon to commit, so as to be sure the weather would cooperate. Whether or not you are a photography nut, choose a seat on either side of the boat, but definitely the end (water) seat. And if you are a photography nut, be sure your camera has at least 5 times as many photo shots available as you think you will need. I have seen many beautiful cities, but Budapest in the evening wins hands down. I was there in May, and so the cruise for me started while it was still daylight. It was interesting and a pleasant ride. There's an audio guide (included) that identifies and gives background info for many of the buildings and other structures we passed. And then dusk fell. And Budapest turned on its lights. It is indescribable how beautiful are the bridges, the Parliament, the Castle and myriad other buildings along the waterfront. Each time you think you've seen the most beautiful, the next one comes along to top that. And for the $20 you also get a glass of very drinkable wine or beer. Don't miss this!"

A drink on the outbound journey is offered, along with a lemonade offering on the return journey. An english language audio guide, with headphones, is available and suggested to make the journey that much nicer. When you get to dock 7 you are greeted and if you are early for boarding, you can wait in the adjacent lounge. The hostesses for our boat were wonderful. I chose the optional 90 minute stopover on Margaret Island. This worked out very well and I am glad I was able to walk around a bit and explore the island. There is a kiosk right near the dock where you can buy food and drinks. Then in 90 minutes you board the boat for the return trip to your starting point. I had a great time and would not hesitate to take this boat trip again. Cost for this trip was 3,900 HUF."

We waited in the sitting area and then boarded our clean comfy boat. We went upstairs for the air and views but more sheltered seats were available too.

This was the absolute highlight of the trip for me.We set sail at dusk around 19:45 and an hour later it was dark and we got to enjoy seeing all the buildings lit up - which is a truly stunning sight! We had paid a bit more for the exclusive package, which probably works out about the same as the a la carte option once you work the prices out. The staff were extremely friendly and very efficient, even when they accidentally forgot our welcome drink (we arrived late just as the boat left the dock so it was a bit hectic for them), it was quickly brought over when we asked and they were extremely apologetic about it - which was quite unnecessary as it hadn't caused us any problems. The food was really good. I was expecting it to be 'ok' given that you're on a small boat, but actually it really was very tasty. The chocolate brownie dessert is absolutely delicious! And don't worry if the starter seems a bit small because the main course is huge (or it was for me!). If you can and there is space, ask to be seated upstairs. I don't know if we were put here because we had booked the exclusive package? There were fewer tables so we had a clear view on both sides and the roof was completely open, so you can look up at the sky. There is a live band on the lower deck but you can still hear the music and they even thoughtfully put blankets on the backs of the chairs in case it gets chilly - no chance on that in July but the thought was nice."

The trip cost 5500 HUF each which included an hours journey and a free drink (champagne included!!). I loved the journey and after seeing the majority of Budapests sights it was a perfect way to round up the trip to gain a more in depth history of the attractions. It caters for everyone where you can watch a TV whilst listening to an audio tape which spoke in every language.The only downside was trying to take pictures of the views. There are 3 TVs at the front of the boat and the boat isn't open, it's covered with windows. The glare is annoying! And the windows were pretty mucky too! I suppose it'll be helpful in case it's a rainy night.Overall a good trip but I would suggest trying this at the beginning of your trip so you have a good insight into the history of Budapest!!"

During our visit they offerred us a welcome drink (champange, beer or soft drinks, you could choose) also when we were returning they offered us lemonade. At the second day we got the night cruise and the view was just amazing...just loved it. If you cannot afford both tours i defenitly suggest you the dinner tour!!!!"

That was planned as a special dinner for my wife and me as we had 6 year wedding anniversary in that day. We came 20 mins before departure, and got seated in the middle row in the direct sunlight in 30+ C heat. I asked to give us a seat by water, to no avail.The service was slow, bubbly warm and over sweet. The food tasted OK, but I got a terrible case of heartburn the next morning. Normally I don't get heartburn, maybe once a year, so that must have been really bad food.Never again!"

The crew did speak many languages, so it's underdtandable for everyone in the world ( i think ). The tour guide is something like a walkman. You select a language on the device, and there you go. You put on the headphones and you can enjoy a very good structured and good understandable tour in your language. You will get one drink, and one small lamonade too. Like i said, it was a good tour and I would recommend you to do your tour on this boat. ( The tour I did was the normal tour. There are dinner boat tours, too. The boat for the dinner tour looked like the normal one, but i heard that the food is amazing on the dinner tour boat. )"

The tour takes an hour and is well supported by an audio visual program that is informative and allows you to appreciate the sights. A glass of champagne, wine, beer or soft drink is included as part of the sightseeing tour, which we took from 10:15pm. Unfortunately, they aren't too organised in the boarding process, with guests jumping the queue and annoying those that are already in line.Once on board there is no discipline with guests being allowed to hang over the side taking photos, while obscuring your view, or being allowed to stand and take photos, with the same effect. I would not recommend the tour if this would lead to agitation."

First we got all confused on which headsets were the ones we were to use- ones in front or on chair. Evidently it is the ones in front but then the cords are not long enough so you have to lean forward. The headsets also kept changing languages on me. That was annoying. Also you get a drink as part of the trip. They don't tell you that. They take your order at the beginning and pick up your cup at the end. Recommend the night tour to see the buildings lit up! Up top is nice but windy and chilly."

Unfortunately this was completely ruined by Legenda and their staff. Getting onto the boat was easy. We arrived early to get good seats at the front and we did. Everything was smooth until the tour started and we found out that our audio guide did not work. This is not uncommon in a tour and easily fixed so we asked the staff to replace the audio guide. The female staff serving our section, told us she would look into it. 10 minutes on nothing. We ask her again, what is happening, we are missing the audio tour, the main point of taking this tour. She tells us that she does not know anything about these audio guides. Hello? You work in a tour boat and you don't know anything about this? You don't have to know them, just replace them with another. She says she can't. So I ask her who on the boat knows about the guides or is in change and she says the captain knows. So I ask her to tell the captain that the units are not working. She goes away inside. 20 minutes without audio, still nothing. I waive to her again and she is now clearly agitated and trying to avoid me all together. I ask her what's happening and if she told the captain. She says and I quote \"Sorry, there is nothing we can do\". What?? Your are a tour company and you cannot do anything when part of the tour equipment is not working? I would assume, this is a regular common issue and you would just replace a faulty one with a working one and everyone is happy. I demand to speak to the captain now and she says the captain is busy and cannot be disturbed! By this time 30 minutes has already passed and we have missed half of the tour. I could tell by then that the staff of my section was not the only INCOMPETENT Legenda staff but the captain was incompetent as well. Out of the 30 missed already passed, we were sailing completely parallel to another boat for the last 20 minutes. So basically another boat was blocking all our views when we were passing the landmarks. I would assume any normal sane person in charge would speed up or slow down a bit so that they were not parallel to another boat on a sightseeing river cruise, but not this crew, not Legenda Sightseeing Boats. God forbid, if they somehow actually give a good tour. Seriously, you cannot make this up. See attached photo as proof!! I asked the name of the female staff and she told me her name is Babet or Rabet. Did not seem like a real name. Seriously avoid this company. Just to put this in context, this is my FIRST negative review in tripadvisor out of the 20 I have written."

Our concierge from the Klempinski hotel recommended this evening cruise as it was just a short walk from the hotel so we booked it for our last evening in Budapest. We enjoyed the magical lights all along the river all while enjoying a nice dinner. The service was pleasant and prompt. I enjoyed listening to all the announcements in the various languages. We were seated at a table for two but were free to move around as we wanted to take pictures occasionally as we passed the sights. Parliament was spectacular as viewed in the evening with all its lights aglow. It was one of our favorite pictures and memories of our trip. The live music provided was especially enjoyable to provide ambiance to the tour. I enjoyed the venison dish for the first time and found it quite nice and tasty. With the lights dim and candlelight on the tabletops it provided just the right touch to be a wonderfully romantic evening to end our trip."

We started the trip on the mainland (can't remember which side) and we got off at Margaret Island to explore. The boat was pretty much on time when we waited for it on Margaret Island. They served drinks on board (included in the ticket price). The wait staff were friendly (and nice to look at :) )."

I suggest you choose the boat ride time right at sunset because our sunset views were beautiful, and it was the perfect time to get photos both before and after the sunset. Keep in mind that the buildings and bridges all light up at night, which is definitely worth seeing."

Myself and my partner are students and they gave student discount which was a big plus! And they also give a free drink to enjoy during your tour on the river. We wanted to make sure we went when it was dark so we booked the 9pm tour and boy it didn't disappoint! The buildings and bridges all looked fantastic and the boat even includes a guided commentary on headphones if you want to know about the history. Lucky we had a clear dry night and it was fairly warm, although the downstairs of the boat is under cover anyway. The one side is that the Windows were not very clean in order to take clear photos and I had to keep getting up from my seat to find an opening further down the boat. The boat does have indoor and outdoor seating but the outdoor (top of the boat) was too busy by the time we arrived. All in all, a brilliant cruise which we very much enjoyed and would highly recommend it to anyone."

My girlfriend and I went for the 4 course a la carte dinner cruise aboard the Legenda - at around \u00a350 each, it seemed a little expensive but we were keen to see the city at night from the river and had seen some positive reviews of this.We were greeted onto the boat by a really welcoming team and were shown up to the higher deck of the boat which is where they placed most of the couples as it is not big enough for larger tables. We were given a glass of champagne on arrival as promised and we also ordered some extra drinks. The staff were superb all night - so polite and courteous, and nothing was too much trouble for them.Once we had ordered some drinks and took in some of the views from the river, we ordered our food - there is a really good selection of food on the menu - I ordered the selection of Hungarian appetizers to start, followed by a beef and bone marrow broth, duck breast with a cherry sauce, and a chocolate tart to finish. All the food was delicious, and benefited from having a proper kitchen on board - all 4 courses were great restaurant quality. We had a few drinks on board which you have to pay extra for, but they are reasonably priced. The views of Buda Castle and the Parliament building from the river at night are beautiful, and what made this even better was the live music on board. There was only a guitarist and singer but they played some great songs and was just really nice background music to have throughout the trip. Overall, would have to recommend this to anyone visiting Budapest - it was the highlight of our trip and well worth the money we paid."

Legenda Sightseeing Boats was recommended to us by our hotel (Hotel Moments; highly recommended!). They fill up quickly so we couldn't make a same-day reservation. You could either select an a la carte ticket or a 4-course a la carte ticket (better deal in our opinion). We tried making reservations online but it said the Budapest tourism card (forgot the actual name) was required. We simply went to the front desk of our hotel and they fixed things for us! None needed after all. The dock was pretty simple to find. Someone walked us to our table and we were able to put in our orders shortly after. There were a few men playing live music. I had the scallops appetizer (delicious), consomm\u00e9 soup (not nasty but boring), duck breast entree (pretty good), and brownie dessert (ehh). My boyfriend had the same appetizer, same soup, beef steak entree (he seemed to enjoy it but I don't think it was cooked to his preference), and panna cotta dessert (yum). You receive 1 free beverage and you pay for the rest. The boat ride was 2.5 hours long and pretty smooth."

Taking 2hr 30mins approximately, we began in the light and finished in the dark, therefore seeing the Danube and background from both perspectives.

However, this night was absolutely amazing from beginning to end. The staff (thanks Bettina) were exceptional and couldn't do enough to make our night special.

Went on this boat trip at night on the recommendation of our hotels receptionist who, knowing we were all skeptical of the quality of the food, showed us pics on her Facebook of the night before with her boyfriend! So we figured if a local girl enjoyed it then we would go... Us 3 were so glad we did . And so glad we went with Legenda. Firstly the boat is relatively small and we actually got to joke and chat with customers at tables around us ( although there is ample space between tables). There are a lot of wait staff on board and even though they forgot our champagnes ( which then arrived in wine glasses as they had run out of flutes) they delivered 2 extra complimentary champagnes to our table as soon as they realised their tardiness... And complimentary to the other table which were served up in wine goblets! Well the food was superb.. All 4 courses.. And i think Im a bit of a foodie so was pleasantly surprised. Firstly it is the only boat to have its own kitchen on board ( the others have food delivered to the boat by caterers). Scallops in chilli, beef broth, lamb with red currant sauce ( from memory ..?) and panna cotta. You just pay for your drinks .. So we thought $90 was very reasonableThe cruise itself lasts about 2 hrs and is relaxing and filled with photo opportunities. I dont normally do any group tours of any sort and my friends and I were quite impressed. It is very good considering the food is done in a small kitchen. And most people had taken the time to dress up which was nice. Mixed ages ranging from young couples and a group of young men to middle age couples. Im rating this 5 for what it is.. Food on a boat.. At a decent price. Dont expect Heston Blumenthal style food for the price and you wont be disappointed"

There is a audio headset in different languages which keeps you informed as you go and a TV video to watch. The cruise on the Danube at night is truly fantastic and the Parliamentary building absolutely stunning lit up at night, as well as the bridges, monuments and other buildings.

We began with sunset time and then moved into darkness with the fabulous lit up sights of Parliament House, Fiaherman's Bastion and Buda Palace to mention the most stunning.

We were lucky enough to be upstairs \u2013 only 7 two-seater tables in total. Once past the Parliament building a crew member closed the perspex cover to keep out the cold but it did not obscure our viewing.

Naturally, the lighted-up buildings were beautiful at night. The cruise staff members were pleasant and helpful. One woman had made a reservation online but hadn't received a confirmation, and this was not a problem. I highly recommend this cruise company."

The Legenda stands out as the premier for several reasons. First, there is ample courteous staff everywhere. Second, there are plenty of good seats ( I recommend getting there early and trying to nab one of the upper deck outdoor seats). The voice over system supports 30+ languages and while a bit exaggerated, it is informative and interesting. Watching the staff climb the stairs with 20+ drinks on a serving tray was worth the price all by itself. Lastly, do the nighttime tour. The city by the river at night is breathtaking and the view from the river will stay with you for a long time."

We turned to trip advisor for guidance and the ratings for the Legenda dinner cruise are well deserved. Don't be swayed when you walk up and see a small boat amongst giants, stay the course. I suggest taking the evening cruise, approx. 7:45 p.m departure when we went. It gave a nice glimpse of the sunset and great views of a lit up Budapest at night. The food was fantastic, although some may argue a tad pricey but great things come with a cost. The dinner cruise offers a four course meal (app, soup, main,dessert) in a classy little boat with a full glass exterior to afford riders superb views and photo opportunities of the city regardless of seating position. The appetizers were certainly light for a big eater such as myself, but don't fret, glory lies ahead. We had the shrimp and scallops both of which were delicious apps. Then the soup came, given that we can't eat pork, and the marrow used was that of a pig, we ordered the citrus cream soup, which seemed more like a light dessert but was also delicious. Then at last the main course, they gave pretty generous portions on all of the mains at our table, we ordered the duck, trout, steak and risotto as a side. All were great, but the duck reigned supreme in my eyes. Desserts were all solid. There was live music as well, the guitarist played like a champ. The only possible complaint I could have for this cruise is that for those who sit at the tables in the very front near the musicians, the music got a tad loud from time to time making it a little hard to converse.

When it gets dark the buildings and bridges turnes on the light- very beatiful. Had the 4 courses dinner . A glass of champagne first, starters, soup, main course and dessert. This is included in the ticket. Vine and more drinks is extra. Its live music, relaxing setting after a long sightseeing day and the people working at the boat is nice, fast and has good suggestions of vine with the food. The food was of a high restaurant quality. They play live music all along the trip. Had a table at the window with the best view. A little more expencive than some other trips but probably worth it when on holidayBook the tour on the webside before arriving , its popular!"

I am very satisfied by the third course, I chose the duck breast with rosemary in cherry sauce, delicious. The musical accompaniment was very enjoyable. Romantic atmosphere and stunning views.

The audio tour (thru headsets) comes in an amazing amount of languages, and tells you interesting things about the sites you see as well as some history of Budapest and Hungary.

We read other reviews before we went and one criticism had been that the boat went back and forth on the same piece of river but we found it meant we saw things we had missed the first time and as we were eating we didn't want to spend the whole time looking out the window. The entertainment was good but I personally found it was a bit repetitive as we were on the boat for 2 1/2 hours."

The boats of LEGENDA are really well equipped and nice. .....BUT.....The DINNER CRUISE just don't worth it !!As it is really expensive and tasteless!The quality and quantity is really POOR!!So just take the cruise!!"

We didn't want a dinner cruise but this was also an option with this company. It cost \u00a313 each and included full audio tour in ur choice of language and also a drink of choice. The cruise was amazing and a very interesting narration given of the most amazing sights...the palace, Chain bridge, Parliament and history of the joining of Buda and Pest. Tour lasted 1 hour, boat was immaculately clean, comfortable and had lovely attentive staff. Totally recommend this for ur river cruise in Danube."

I booked the dinner cruise at the end. As soon as we stepped on the boat, we were greeted by the lovely smiles of the welcoming and helpful staff. The boarding procedure took a while as the dinner cruise was fully booked. The best thing about this experience was the spectacular night view. Food was not bad either so overall it was a brilliant night."

Boarding process was diabolical with a general free for all and little to no control. We decided to jump off mid cruise and enjoy the walk through the island gardens rather than endure the cruise cruise back. Cabin temp was pretty warm throughout, would suggest opening a window or two."

The building along the Danube are fabulous during the day, but at night you get treated to an even extra special view.The cruise itself was nice, but it felt a bit rushed at times. Food was actually very good and service staff very attentive. We really enjoyed the live music being played by a small 3 piece band.The only criticism would be to allow a little down time, so that picture of the beautiful riverside could be taken."

Proper headphones were the first surprise, so much easy than the things you normally have to stick in your ears. We were offered a drink, a cold beer was great on a hot day. The commentary was very well done. Two commentators one called Buda and one Pest so that it was easier to understand which side of the river was being described. Towards the end we were then offered some very refreshing home made lemonade. A great trip."

We made the reservation online two months ago and upon arrival they seemed unsure about our reservation and the staff excused herself to check again but it's resolved in a minute or two. You can choose the welcome drink (red, white, sparkling wine and beer). We had the sparkling wine which were quite nice. We paid for the four course a la carte dinner package. For starters, my bf had Hungarian cold appetitizers and he said the ham was great. I had the scallop and it was good but nothing surprising. For soup, we had pumpkin soup and the consomm\u00e9 with bone marrow. We both prefer the pumpkin soup more but it doesn't mean the consomm\u00e9 wasn't good, it's just we ain't that into the \"concentrated\" taste soup. For the main, we had the duck breast and the pork tenderloin and they were well cooked and meat were tender and juicy. We ordered a bottle of St Andrea Pinot Noir to go with the main and they just matched perfectly. For dessert, my bf had the panna cotta and he said it was the best wanna cotta he has ever had. I had the brownie but it was average to me since it's rather dry and I'm more into moist type of brownie. But it's just personal preference anyway. The waitress asked if we would like to have tea and coffee to go with our dessert and we said yes. At the end, we paid 8500HUF extra on top of the package (for a bottle of wine and 1 tea, 1 coffee plus service charge).For those who have the Budapest card, you would enjoy almost 20% off the ticket price. But there are no discount on the extra ordered you made on board.For the view, we were seated at the upper deck with the glass roofing. It wasn't perfectly clean but it was acceptable. And if you would like to take photo without glass reflection, you can always go downstairs to the stern through a sliding door. It was quite chilly even in April but it's warm and cozy inside and they offer you blanket if you want.Overall food was good, service was helpful and polite, beautiful view. I couldn't put it to 5 stars just because it is quite pricy (130e for two)."

The food was beautifully presented, the choice is excellent. We were both very impressed. We purchased a bottle of wine on board which was roughly \u00a310, very good value! My husband ordered a birthday candle and during the dessert service the live music singer sang \"happy birthday\" and the waitress presented the amazing pud! A lovely touch. The views along the Danube are fantastic, so much to see, we were able to take photos with no problem. I've read some previous comments and I don't think it necessary to have a running commentary describing the buildings etc., I want to enjoy a lovely meal with moving scenery listening to the serenading music! My suggestion is to read your guide book then you'd know what you are looking at!"

I booked it and paid for it months in advance and asked at the time of booking for a window seat, which we did get. I also mentioned it was his birthday in the booking, and they must have taken note of us this because at the end of the Meal they brought out a birthday dessert and candle and sang happy birthday. As I'd booked this like three months in advance, I'd actually forgotten that I had mentioned his birthday to them so this was a lovely surprise for both of us!!I'm so glad I chose this for his birthday night, it was great. Really romantic and great food! I'm a reasonably fussy eater, but I enjoyed all the food!! The views were spectacular and an experience we won't ever forget!"

We did the evening Legend trip which was 11K ft for 2 people. You can choose to sit on the top deck on plastic chairs (cold at night!) or lower deck on the comfy chairs. There is a free audio-guide which gives a history of Budapest and each landmark that you pass, although sometimes it's not to clear what you're suppose to be looking at. They have a TV screen which also shows a visual to go with the guide. You will receive a free drink onboard (champagne, soft drink or beer) that is brought to you. There is WiFi on board, but the further away you are from the front, the worse it is. You'll be taken as far as the Palace of Arts and back to Margaret Island which takes an hour. It's a nice scenic and quiet tour, but there are much cheaper available that offer food with the price or club music. Have a walk/look down the river before you choose."

We expected that the meal would take approximately 1-1.5 hours, with the remainder of the time spent outside (or looking through open windows), taking photos of the sights and buildings. All while being serenaded by the live band.Unfortunately it was not to be. The meal took the full 2.5 hours and we were finishing the dessert just prior to docking. The soup was nothing special, the main course (veal cheeks and the duck) was delicious, but the dessert was the smallest piece ever served in the history of miniature desserts.We were sat upstairs with 6 other tables, covered completely by plexiglass windows. It was very difficult to take photos, not least because of the reflections of the lights from inside the boat. These stayed on the entire journey. There was nowhere to take photographs outside and no time as we were ordering or eating food.The diners who were sat downstairs presumably enjoyed the live singer. We never saw her, although she sounded reasonable over the loudspeaker. There is no commentary at any time during the cruise.If I had known that it was completely covered over, with lights reflecting off the windows, that we would be sat upstairs with a few others, that we could not see the singers or other diners, that photos could not be taken outside and that the meal would take 2.5 hours I would have simply booked a different cruise that had open air views (there are many available) and eaten onshore before sailing.This cruise was meant to be the highlight of our stay on our last evening. We dearly wanted a special experience, but unfortunately it did not live up to our expectations and we were left disappointed."

We chose to take the cruise with a welcome drink (on the recommendation of our hotel, regrettably) - we didn't want a dinner as we wanted to choose from the many restaurants in the city whilst we were there. Unfortunately, this was a really poor experience. We had to walk through the dinner boat to get to our boat - it was beautifully set up and looked romantic and classy. However, our boat was no better than a bus, with windows so grubby you had to go outside to take pictures (in March, it was cold!). How can you run a sightseeing boat without clean windows? There was also a cheesy information video which meant you kept getting up and down to take pictures, then listen to the video. This could be so much improved if they made it like the dinner boat but with high bar tables. Make it classy and pleasant to be on. Do away with the video. Let people buy extra drinks from the bar if they would like to. Create an atmosphere. Sadly this trip did not meet any of my expectations. I cannot work out who they are trying to appeal to with this - it's not a party boat, nor particularly informative, nor atmospheric. It was just nothing.When it's this bad you may as well walk the river at night to see the sights - the views are just as good. Unless they are going to attempt to make it a special experience this really is a waste of time and money."

We were staying in Budapest over Valentine's Day and thought it would be perfect as our valentines night (long story short they were fully booked so we chose a different day in hindsight we should have booked in advance).We chose the evening candlelit exclusive dinner option. Were told the boat would be leaving at 19:00 so we arrived in plenty of time.When being shown to our seat on the boat we found we were on the top 'deck' with 3 other couples so very intimate and even better view so this was a massive bonus.The boat took a little time to set off but we soon got on our way and our orders were taken straight away. As we had the exclusive dinner we had all 4 course orders taken at one time so we had to chose quickly and all together (luckily we'd already decided what we wanted).The food came out swiftly one meal after another, as we were quite secluded we thought we might have been left and service was poor but boy were we wrong! The food was very gourmet and very very yummy. The views on the boat are from another world, Budapest at night is 100000x more beautiful than during the day.We paid 18,600 forint which works out around \u00a347.00. In this price was a 4 course a la Carte meal and a welcome drink. I thought the portions were going to tiny and pretty but safe to say I was stuffed! I had a glass of wine for my welcome drink, very tasty and very large at that. It was slightly chilly as we were on the top however blankets were supplied and we soon warmed up after dinner.Overall thoroughly impressed and enjoyed our boat cruise.There are other cheaper options on this cruise and also other cruises available to suit everyone. 100% must whilst staying in Budapest."

Aboard the boat the staff were highly trained - proudly multi lingual, attentive servers and very polite. The food was great too. The meal came with a free drink which unlike most free drinks was enormous (my glass of champagne was the size of a large glass of wine). After that the drinks menu was pretty reasonable. They had a great blues/folk band that were perfect for the ambience. I was travelling alone and so having been unable to find anyone in my hostel to join me so was the only one by myself, but this made absolutely no difference and I still enjoyed the evening immensely.

This is a must-do when you're in Budapest, as it's a unique and beautiful way to experience the city: in the evening, when it's all lit up, on a beautiful boat (covered with a glass dome, so it's not cold), with delicious food and wine, and listening to a live band for 2.5 hours. We bought the nicer tickets (which include better seats, a 4-course meal, and a glass of champagne), and those were totally worth it. We got seated right next to the window and in front of the 3-piece band (which happened to be playing really cool bluegrass versions of Rolling Stones, Guns N Roses, etc.). The food was fantastic: with the nicer tickets, you get to choose one of the appetizers, a soup, an entree, and a dessert. The beef tartar and goose liver appetizers were both fantastic, as was the bone broth soup, the duck breast entree, and the brownie dessert. We ordered a bottle of wine, and were very impressed with how good that was too (wine is about 3900-12000 for a bottle). Our server Viki was very friendly and attentive, so we chose to tip on both the pre-purchased food tickets and the wine (and then the band separately) \u2014\u00a0but that's up to you."

We paid 18 euros each for the 1 hour cruise which included a glass of champagne/wine/beer. This which was much needed after our printed ticket flew out of my husband's hand, into the wind and into the Danube literally 5 minutes before the boat was meant to leave just as we were about to board. Luckily the staff were really helpful and it was all sorted as I managed to get the confirmation email up on my phone.All of the staff were really helpful and friendly and the boat was really nice and clean and warm as well. The views out of the windows were great (unlike a boat trip we went on in Amsterdam when the windows were all steamed/misted up). Overall, a most enjoyable informative sightseeing cruise at a good price."

Even in December it was very busy and it became rather uncomfortable in the waiting room. However, the cruise was very rewarding, I did find the commentary a bit confusing and the headphones didn't fit, but I just ignored all that. This is all about the views. Every building, every statue, every bridge is illuminated at night and it feels like something out of this world. And I loved the glass of champagne too."

They were welcoming, attentive without being overbearing, very friendly and the range of languages they spoke was so impressive! I think we paid about \u00a350 for the cruise and a 4 course meal with wine. Honestly this was such a bargain.

The service was very good, not rushed and well spread out over the 2.5 hours of the cruise. We had a bottle of Hungarian sparkling wine and the cost was about \u00a310, so we did not feel as though we were being ripped of.As for the boat, it was clean, warm and with adequate space.

We completed two circuits of the main city length of the river and were able to clearly view all of the wonderfully illuminated buildings. Overall, good value for the money and a great way to spend a pleasant evening - I'm not so sure what the views may be like on a wet evening with all of the glass misted - try and pick good weather."

I expected it to be no different when I took the 9:00 Danube Legend tour with Legenda. However, introducing the night time aspect, with how Budapest is lit up at night, and you get something special Did not pre-book a trip, so wandered along the Danube Promenade looking for a kiosk or something. Near a restaurant called Peppers, I found a set of stairs down to the river where both Legenda and another company (they had a sign, Legenda just had a guy) were selling tickets. Found out it would be a mostly full boat, but they could fit a single.The audio guide comes in quite a few languages and while it has a goofy aspect, it maps out what you are seeing and provides some history about how everything came about. Really enjoyed it. Nice and relaxing. Mostly people stayed in place, instead of hopping all over taking pictures, and it was a beautiful evening weather wise. Enjoyed it enough, that while in Krakow, Wroclaw and Prague I decided to forego river cruises, not expecting them to provide the same level of enjoyment as Budapest."

It's a wonderfully relaxing way to unwind after a full day of sightseeing, and you learn about the city, too. MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

The boat itself is nice, with enclosed first and second levels for more pleasant dining. The river at night is beautiful. Dinner, while nice, was served very slowly, so slowly in fact that we cruised back and forth over the same territory all evening. At one point, we went back to the dock to pick up a couple who were late, and at another point we returned to the dock to allow another couple to leave early. The live music was again pleasant enough, but I would have preferred selections other than American \"oldies\". At one point, I went to the women's restroom. Always a line, no matter where, so I joined two other women in waiting. One stood up against the wall opposite the door, and was unexpectedly and painfully slammed into another wall and the waiting bench when the 3\" thick door to the kitchen slammed into her. There was no slow opening, no warning, just a fast slam as this automated door opened. There was also no safety notice posted saying \"don't lean on this wall\", a real lack of understanding by management that there would actually be people in that position on the boat. When we returned to the dock from the cruise, there were no taxis except for those that were \"off the meter\" and wanted outrageous fares, so one of the hostesses had to call for one. Next time, we'll eat at one of the many restaurants in the area, then go for the one hour river cruise without dinner."

First of all two of the staff were extremely rude on entering the boat.An American lady was shouted at and was within her rights to let the waitress know instantly you do not address people in that way.My partner and I were then seated on a small worthless table where everyone goes outside to smoke.And not in the area where you could see the sights going by.We complained and asked to get a refund and leave.Then there was another small table offered on the upper deck.Half heartedly we mistakenly took this offer up but soon came to regret it.Our waitress was pleasant and courteous enough but once again we were sat where neither of us could actually view the sights going by.But by this time we were already stuck on the boat for 2/12 hours...So the wine and beer were both fine.The food however was awful and we didn't finish either of the courses we ordered.The worst food of our trip.At the end of this god forsaken trip we decided not to pay for the food and just the drinks.Our waitress then changed from being courteous to annoyed as she would have to forfeit the cost from her wages.Which I thought was extremely unfair for her to lose out due to the chef.Nevertheless I refuse to pay for something that is awful.Our advice would be if you want to see the sights by night then go on a shorter cheaper tour and dine in one of the many superior restaurants on land.This is just a tourist trap basically.Avoid!!!"

I don't know why it costs double. I booked online, and when I reached the place, there were other operators who offered same for 9 euros. There are few limited seats to upper open deck. So you need to wait in queue in advance if you want to sit up. Rest of the people have to sit down, which is partially open sideways. The commentary was nice and you have to use headphones if you want to hear it. It runs simultaneously in many languages and there is a button to select yours. You get to see all the beautiful views on Danube banks, the parliament etc."

While in Budapest we decided that a late afternoon river cruise would be fun and our tour host recommended Legenda cruises which are located near the Marriott hotel on the Danube just up from the Parliament building. We arrived a \u00bd hour early to purchase our tickets and relaxed in the shady waiting area which had a very welcoming water cooler that helped out with the 95 F temperature . The two Adult tickets cost $28.84 US and were priced just as all of the other cruise ships that we looked at.Each seat had a headset that had a number of different languages available to listen to the tour. A complimentary drink was offered to include adult beverages and fresh lemonade was served at the end as well.The staff was very professional and the cruise was just what we were looking for.All in all a very pleasant cruise seeing the sights and listening to the detailed tour information while sipping a cold beer."

Go past all the major sites along the Danube and listen to a rather informative audio guide (in many languages) that isn't super-corny and instead, really instructional. They allow you to get off at Margaret Island for 1.5 hours during the earlier tours. Do this, and rent a bike for the hour (only around $5 USD). It's a nice escape from throngs of tourists and has beautiful parks and gardens. Boat ride back took about 20 minutes and they serve you their own sparkling lemonade (which tasted remarkably like ginger ale...) Overall, an easy and enjoyable experience on the Danube!"

Cost \u00a338 each. We arrived shown on to boat by very friendly staff sat at our table in the boat that has glass dome over it so unobstructed views of Budapest at night. Given a welcome drink although the blurb states champagne you can have alternative i had a beer as did wife friends had red wine and shandy. Food was fantastic, Music on trip organist and singer very good mostly 70's and 80's music i like this. You travel on a large oval around Margaret island then past Budapest East and then another shorter route missing island on the water for over 2 and a half hours. Friends that we were with told staff that it was my wife's birthday as i was under threat of death. Out came the sweets the staff put a candle in her sweet the musicians played and sang happy birthday with the rest of the boat joining in and to top it all our party were given a glass of bubbly look at the pics of the sights at night as it was unobstructed as we were on the water difficult to explain but FANTASTIC if in Budapest give it a go.

The also include a Welcome drink in the price, so we each had our first glass of wine included.I had expected this to be a sightseeing cruise where we got fed. Instead, we were presently surprised that the food was really good!! Beautifully presented, tasty and well balanced portion sizes. The wait staff were very professional and efficient, as you need to be on a timed event such as this. (it's 2/1/2 hours)The boat is very comfortable, linen tablecloths, nice lighting and a singer and guitar player provided pleasant dinner music. There is no \"guided tour\" on this cruise. As it was a nice evening, The sides of the boat were open to let the breeze in.The scenery is beautiful! The tour starts before dark, so your first pass of some of the sites is in daylight, but then when the sun goes down, many of the buildings are lit up. The Parliament building is spectacular!I truly enjoyed this outing and would recommend it to anyone."

I caught it on time, but then we noticed the two working the crowd. I was going to scream, but was afraid because the dock is in an isolated place, it was going to be dark when we got back and didn't want them waiting for us. I told three staff members who did absolutely nothing about it. They didn't warn anyone, nothing. That made us suspicious that maybe they would get a cut.

Around 8000HUF each person for your ticket, a free drink of your choice, there was live music, and you pay extra for food. You can choose a 4 course set menu option which costs more, but I'm a fussy eater so preferred to have more option. Food was cooked to perfection, I'm fussy with meat but I was really happy with the steak I ordered-tasted great, dressed nicely, couldn't fault it. We were seated on the top of the boat which gave us an amazing view across the Danube whilst we were eating, and it was very romantic. Took a while for them to come round and order everyone's food, and also to cook it took a while, but we were quite happy to wait as there were a lot of people on board, we were always asked if we needed drinks topping up, and we had the beautiful view of the Danube and all the amazing buildings/sights to see. The parliament building at night all lit up was especially amazing and great to experience . 2 live singers were on the boat which was a nice accompaniment to our meal. A great thing to experience and amazing way to see budapest! The boat leaves at around 8pm so the sun is just setting which is the perfect time, as all the buildings start to be lit up which is beautiful. Please do book yourself onto this! :)"

You line up inside a small waiting area and it continues back up the dock. Once the boat is docked, passengers from a previous cruise get off and you board. Our boat had a complete open top with a middle aisle and one set on each side, about 40 people max up top. We were there early enough to get up top and secure excellent seats with optimum views. The downstairs had and aisle and like 4 seats on each side which would make it tough for easy viewing and photos. Don't think it would have been nearly as good from down there. Our seats up top were perfect. We had outstanding, clear views of everything and it was easy to get great photos from either side of the boat. The audio headsets worked great and they provide perfect narration of the river and what you are seeing. Overall, this was a real nice cruse for the $'s and we'd recommend it. As said, go early to secure the type of view you want and you won't be disappointed."

My friend and I had wanted to do a boat trip in our 3 day visit of Budapest but hadn't booked anything in advance. Our hotel gave us a sheet with recommended boat trips and this was one of them. On the Thursday we were walking along the river and spotted a guy selling tickets for this boat trip. The whole weekend was advertised as 'Red Bull Air Race weekend' but this didn't actually start til the Saturday. We paid there and then and booked onto the 20:15 sunset trip for the following day.On the Friday we turned up at the time stated on our ticket to find people queuing down the gateway and congregating in a large group on the pontoon. We were let onto the boat not long before the stated leaving time, but were dismayed to experience the pushing and shoving of the other tourists in a precarious area - but perhaps that's because we are British and we know how to queue! After a large group were let on to the boat, there was some shoving to try and get through, so in true British style I held my own and didn't let anyone push through.Once on the boat (on which there was obviously plenty of seats and no need for all the bloody shoving) we set ogre down the Danube. The views from.the boat were amazing, especially when we got up to near Margaret Island to turn back round and all the buildings and bridges lit up. Parliament especially is spectacular!The price of the trip comes with a free drink, which did take a while to arrive but was pleasant enough. The commentary provided through the headphones was a bit cringey at times, when voices spoke as though they were a statue etc and some commentary didn't actually relate to anything we were going past.Once we arrived back there was again a rush to get off the boat, and when we did eventually get off, we were greeted by the next group of people all congregated and blocking up the gangway 2 wide, only allow us to disembark in single file.A worthwhile trip, just crowd control could be much better and make for an even better experience - the opportunity to do what you liked whilst waiting to get on the boat was taken advantage of by other tourists!"

You can also learn a lot as they have an audio guide in 30 languages. We took the 5 pm cruise which doesn't include dinner and lasts about 1 hr 15 mins. Ticket prices were very reasonable (about $35 for 3) and include a free drink (beer, wine, champagne, or soft drink) and a free lemonade. Our boat wasn't crowded, but I would still recommend buying tickets at your hotel so you can avoid the ticket line at the dock. The dock is conveniently located in the middle of town on the Pest side. You have the option of spending 1.5 hours on Margaret Island, but we stayed on the boat. We got some amazing photos of the parliament building, Buda Castle, Chain Bridge and many others."

This cruise was outstanding cost around 40 pound per person which includes a 2 hour 30 minute cruise a 4 course meal (starter, soup, main and desert) and a welcome drink with a band playing. The service on board was faultless it was truly a beautiful experience and the food was top quality. It is worth every penny and the sights look stunning lit up on the night. The drinks are cheap as well a bottle of rose wine 3400 huf which is around 8 english pounds which is highly reasonable. Its a perfect evening to dress up and see the sights. I recommend the scallaps for starter and the steak for main it was delicious. Do not hesitate and book this cruise or you will regret it."

We went during the day on a Monday in June (11am cruise) so the tour boat wasn't busy at all and we were guaranteed a seat on the open deck. The boat we were on had mostly indoor seating so if it had been busy the experience may not have been quite as good. There is a small (standing only) open deck at the stern of the boat (where I stood most of the trip) where you can get the best photos. There is at-seat commentary in many languages giving you information on historic buildings/bridges throughout the trip. There's the option to jump off at Margaret Island but we stayed on as the guidebook was light on things to do/see there. The cruise lasts approx 1 hr 30 mins and included two complimentary drinks (alcoholic or soft)."

However the boats do get crowded we were there 40 minutes before the tour and if we were 5 minutes later we would have been almost last onto the boat. If you are taking the tour in summer check the sunset times and take one that spans the sunset as the atmosphere is really nice.The audio guide comes in many languages but is a little confused as the audio goes on about sights that are actually not visibly from the boat and this just confuses you sometimes as they don't really explain what you are passing. I actually took off the headset and just enjoyed the view after a while.The boat tour includes a drink (Soft, Wine or Champagne) and the staff are very friendly. The inside cabins are not so good for photography as the lights inside reflect off the glass windows. If it is warm try and go to the second floor and outside by the back of the boat."

My husband was able to make the reservation and pay on the Legenda website, then he printed the reservation from our hotel's printer and brought it along that night - no problem! Our boat left at 9:00 pm, so we got to the dock at 8:25 and saw people starting to enter the waiting area at the bottom of the ramp. Once the staff worker started taking tickets, everyone in the waiting room was very impatient to push forward and get on the boat first. I guess they were all trying to get the best seats on the boat... We got on the boat and headed to the top deck. There, the seats on both sides of the boat are in groups of 2, so we had no trouble finding two seats together. There was an informational narrative video that played for the entire ride, and you could choose from a variety of different languages. The boat went south down the river past the Liberty Bridge, then turned around and went north to the Margaret Bridge before turning around and returning to the dock. The buildings were it up beautifully and I got a lot of great pictures during the smooth and entertaining ride. A complimentary drink was also part of the package, and the staff workers bring the drinks to you so there's no need to leave your seat. I can't compare this to the dinner cruise or day cruise, since I didn't take those, but I would recommend the night cruise as a great way to see the city, and worth every penny!"

The scenic views of Budapest were amazing of course, but they were distracted by a crowd of drunk youngsters sitting in the back who were very noisy and kids who were running around and chatting non stop with a very loud voice. We could not even hear the commentary with the headphones on! If they charge so much, at least they should have crowd control, or limit the tour to people who are willing to be considerate of others. They can have a quiet cabin, or a special tour that does not offer commentary for people who just want to hang out and talk."

However, the weather was a bit cool with a few random showers so most of our cruise passengers were inside. The boat is equipped with individual headphones (in 30+ languages) so you can listen to the narrative while cruising. Our only main complaint was that about 25% of the headsets did not work and you had to move to a seat with a working set if you wanted to listen to the program.The cruise lasted about 1 hr or so and allowed us to see a number of Budapest landmarks and structures (most were well lit for nighttime viewing) and several bridges over the Danube. Night photos are difficult at best and impossible from inside the enclosed deck (too much glare from the interior lights on the glass), so I had to go outside and shoot pictures from the rear of the boat. That worked pretty well but it sure was windy and damp.Overall, it was a nice end to our city tour and most folks should enjoy the cruise."

We were seated upstairs which has about 10 tables so wasn't really any atmosphere but when the lights came on and it got darker it was probably the best place to be as you got a good view of all the lit up buildings on the Danube. The waitresses took a while to take the drinks order so was sat for quite a while with just the welcome drink. The food came quite quickly and was hot. The starter and soup was ok I had the beef for the main course and it was very tough. The boat went up and down the Danube quite a few times as we were on board for about 2.5 hours and after the first few times you don't even notice. The music wasn't very good the singer was a little out of tune and we were sat right by the speakers upstairs so had to put one of the blankets they supplied over it to turn it down. All in all it was a relatively good night and I would recommend but just don't expect too much"

We decided to have a cruise on the Danube to enjoy it by night (if you have the Budapest Card or if you are a student there is a discounted price): the cruise is nice and explains every palace/structure that faces on the river with videos and an audio guide (you can select your language). During the trip there is an offered drink (Champagne, wine, soft drinks..). Watch out if you decide to get on the upper level there are no protections, so you can take beautiful pictures, but it can get very cold when it's windy!"

It was far better than I had expected as I had been on another one before and it was not that great food wise. This was extremely well organized with table service. The food was really good, with a good menu - not too many things, but for all tastes I would say. The only thing I would suggest to anyone is that you also take a cruise where there is a guided tour as this particular one was basically food and enjoying the view, not learning the history. There was no information given, which did not bother me in the least as the views were spectacular and I had done the basic tour. Super and well done to the staff. Very polite, efficient, well turned out and quick. Very good VFM."

I wanted to do an evening boat trip whist in Budapest and, I confess, I booked this because it was easy and I could book online! (If you walk along the riverfront there are plenty of other companies doing cheaper trips, lesson learnt.)We arrived early and therefore got near the front of the queue to board, this meant we could get a choice of seats upstairs.The audio-comentary is OK - adds a bit of context to what you're seeing and answered a few etsions that had arisen as we were walking around the city. There is also a TV screen which shows an accompanying programme, allowing you to see inside some of the building facades. I didn't watch it at all, so it was easy to ignore! My partner did watch it, said it was good, so horses for courses.The highlight, of course, is the spectacle of the lit-up banks of the Danube sliding past. Its beautiful and seeing it from the boat is a wonderful way to appreciate it. Boat is under cover, with open air sections for those that want them - another plus point.All in all the boat trip was well worth doing, and the complimentary glass of champagne was a nice touch.But a word of warning - whilst the upstairs of the boat was great, I think I would have been a bit disappointed to be sitting downstairs,with the noise of the bar and more people wedged in.So our trip was very good - but if you're going, get there early or go on a quiet day to make sure of getting a decent seat!"

I was dreaming about such a trip, honestly and I have spent there my 30th birthday so I am very excited about the trip and absolutely loved it!

There was a queue to get on the boat but there's no rush as the tables are reserved. The boat is fairly small and is covered in a glass dome, great for seeing the sights. A musician played a variety of well known tunes. Whilst we ate, the boat did a couple of laps up and down the Danube. The views are spectacular, the best being when the boat turns at Margaret Island. The food was really good. The red wine by the glass was pretty average, perhaps we should have got a bottle!There were a couple of younger children on a nearby table. They behaved pretty poorly at times; crawling on the floor, sitting under the table etc. This was a bit annoying, especially for the waiting staff.Highly recommended."

The boat is enclosed in large plexiglass windows, which keeps you warm. However during the whole cruise they show a travelogue on large screen TVs which reflect on the inside of the windows, making it difficult to see outside. Our headphones didn't work and so we had to use the headphones from the empty seats behind us, craning our necks (we didn't move to that seat because we wanted to stay close to the windows). I didn't see them make any note about the bad headphones, so I presume this goes on cruise-after-cruise. Although there are some beautifully lit buildings along the Danube, much of it is not lit - so there is nothing to see from the boat. You can see the lit buildings from the shore. Our cruise also had a noisy bunch of students in the back half of the boat, making it difficult to hear the narration.The boat itself was nice and the staff were pleasant, so maybe it would be worthwhile for a daytime trip - but not at night."

Whilst it wasn't a complete waste of money (it was cheap enough and ticked the boat cruise off the sightseeing list) it was a very poor cruise in terms of information.It was 70 minutes long yet pretty sure the audio only lasted about 25 if you pushed it all together. Every 5 minutes there was a long gap with music - during the last 20 minutes I don't think there was any audio at all. It was a shame as there was so much that wasn't said that we'd already learnt from the guide book - the 'tour' basically just pointed out the ten main sights. Aside from being completely uneducational there were two presenters called Pest and Buda which made the whole thing feel like it was for kids.On the plus side a local tea (not great) was provided along with a free drink including champagne (better than the tea!). Overall very disappointed but pleased we got 25% off - if I'd have paid full price I'd have been tempted to ask for my money back based on the lack of information or 'tour' aspect."

I think we may have been on an extra boat as they were running 5 ships that evening! The one we were on was quite small and therefore felt more intimate, just right for Valentines!Also included in the price was a small bottle of water each and another glass of fizz or red/white wine. There is the option to buy additional drinks should you wish to. We had a bottle of Hungarian sparkling wine, which came in at HUF6750 incl. tip (approx. \u00a317).The buffet was plentiful and of traditional Hungarian type foods. We weren't particularly hungry but enjoyed the selection we had. Not gourmet but very good and tasty. There was a trio of string musicians playing a mixture of gypsy and classical music, very pleasant and not overbearing.The service was ok, our used plates were taken quickly. However, we did have to ask twice for our extra included glass of wine and towards the end they took our water glasses before we had finished.Excellent hostess who resolved any issues quickly, was happy to answer questions re the view (there is no commentary - which you don't really want on a romantic cruise) and came round to ask if anyone needed a taxi booking at the end of the trip. All in all we felt it was good value at EUR77 for the 2 of us."

There were two live musicians who played most of the time with some poor canned music as they rested. The food was MUCH better than I had anticipated and very well cooked and presented. You make an allowance for the food because you think they can't cook as well as in in a restaurant but this was good quality even for a restaurant. The service was done very enthusiastically by a group of young girls who are very cheerful and speak most languages well. The cruise starts at 7pm and after a few minutes they lower the lights and the scene is breath taking! It's true that the boat turns every 20 minutes or so but it does give you many chances to take some great photos. I can't recommend this boat trip enough. 10/10"

This boat cruise we took a few days after being there but we found that if we had taken it first it would have helped us organize how we explored the city. It gives a good background on the two cities, the bridges that Budapest is famous for, and gives you a view of many of the famous bathhouses, memorials and churches. You get a complimentary warm drink which goes good during the cold winter and we also had some local wine which we were not charged for. The prices were reasonable for a family of four I believe around 25 euro or so. Try this first before venturing around the city."

The 3 course dining experience with wine was delicious and the service impeccable. You just could not fault it. The waitresses were kind welcoming and calm- no rushing about which only added to our enjoyment. In fact I have to say that Royal Caribbean - \"Independence of The Seas\" with its distinct brand of lack of fineness which we had recently been subjected to really do need to take a closer look at how one should treat customers! This Legenda experience with a wonderful singer magically accompanies the spectacular views all along the Danube. Absolutely fabulous! Lit up at night it is easy to see why this is a heritage site and probably one of the most romantic places to be!"

The sight of the Danube at night was lovely although you do go up and down the same piece of river several times. Food was fine and wines were palatable. Service was good and the price reasonable. We were in the upstairs section whilst the band, that played modern standards, was beneath us but we probably saw more of the city. A pleasant way to see the city at night from the river and enjoy some reasonable food and wine."

We went on the 20/01/2015 for a river cruise on the boat called the Duna Bella.The staff were kind and friendly from the start to finish and spoke fluent English. We chose where we could sit either on the upper or lower decks which we sat on good seats on the upper deck. We were given a free drink of complimentary tea towards the start of the journey, (which we thought was our free drink) halfway through the journey we were offered a free drink of our own choice.The scenery on the boat cruise was lovely with an entertaining audio guide system which told you about the city, its buildings statues and historical facts. You could also go outside onto the back of the boat to take better picture if you wanted to. The interior of the boat was also good looking with comfy seats for the duration of the boats journey. I learned much from this river cruise and the audio guide which helped me to know and understand Budapest a lot better.A river cruise on the river Danube is a must do whilst visiting Budapest and I would definitely recommend Legenda river cruises to anyone too. I would also go on a river cruise with Legenda next time I am in Hungary as well. :)"

The ticket says to arrive half an hour before, so why leave everyone sat there waiting to be boarded until ten minutes before the cruise starts?2. The boarding process takes too long, more staff are needed to speed it up. 3. The cruise doesn't really go very far, it would be better if it went further, just driving around in circles isn't very interesting. 4. The heating upstairs didn't work on our cruise and the electrics kept failing. We did get some compensation for that, but it was freezing. That really should have been checked before departing. 5. It is sold as a romanatic dinner cruise - why then were there families on board with children running all over the boat behaving badly?Overall the experience was good, the food was nice and the drinks were pricey, but not terrible. The sights we did see were interesting. This is the second time we have done the cruise and will probably look to see if there is anyone else offering something similar next time."

The staff was very nice and kind and we all were very excited about the dinner. It was quite disappointing though all dishes looked nice but the portion was small and the taste is average compared to the price. For much less you can get better food in the city...And the drinks... They did not have tonic water, and the champagne was the cheapest brand.You cannot miss a boat trip on the Danube, the view is wonderful, especially by night. But I would not recommend for any tourists taking a boat trip with Legenda because it is very expensive. (unless is winter time and you don't have any other choice) From Spring to the end of Autumn take the boat service of the general public transportation company (BKK) for the price of a single ticket (2 EUR) and you get 45 minutes boat trip. It's not that fancy like Legenda but for the money you save take a 5* dinner at an excellent restaurant."

We showed up on a weekday evening without advance-purchase tickets, and were able to get right on. We didn\u2019t purchase advance tickets, as the trip can be a waste of money if the weather is bad! We just showed up on a clear, rain-free night. Be sure to arrive early! Because it was a clear night, we opted to sit on the top deck, and had cozy blankets to keep us warm. The top deck is a much better experience, as you have an un-obstructed view of all of the major landmarks in the city.Although the cruise was expensive compared to other Budapest attraction, it still was really nice. I had taken this cruise before, so I knew what to expect. We knew to ask for blankets on the top deck, and we knew that the headphones for the commentary don\u2019t work at every seat. We realized that a glass of champagne, wine, beer, or soda was a free part of the cruise. There are several options for cruises\u2026 daytime cruises, evening cruises, and evening dinner cruises.

It looks like I have more Cons than Pros but it wasn't so bad.Pros:Gorgeous view of illuminated city from different angle.A welcome drink is included.Lots of language choice.20% off with Budapest Card.Cons:In November, I believe that there was no upper deck open unfortunately. I understand because it is freezing but I had to take photos through the window/ceiling glass. It is almost impossible to take perfect photos from inside because there is reflection of dim light of boat and flashlight of other's camera. Staff starts taking orders of drink only when boat starts moving. If sitting rather rear area, you will get your drink most likely in the latter half of the cruise. I got 20% off thanks to Budapest Bard, but it still costs 4,400 HUR. Rather pricey ?Ticket office is almost invisible !!! I went there to buy a ticket in advance but I left without buying because I didn't see what seemed like ticket office but everybody ! Step further. The small ticket office is kinda in the boat, not on the street. I was back there at 1800 again but I was just told that all tickets were sold out for the day. They had an extra cruise starting at 2000 but it was also full. I had to buy a ticket for the next day, which was the only option. There were 2 of night cruise on the next day as well but both cruises were also fully booked. Lucky me, I at least bought the ticket on previous day. It was the beginning of November. Everybody ! Get your tickets beforehand to avoid disappointment.I arrived around 18:05. Half of the boat was already occupied. I still could take a window seat but if you definitely want to take window seats, get there 30 minutes before. There is another cruising company right next to LEGENDA, it seems like they have more frequent cruises (hourly in the evening) only for 1,900HUR. Of course the language selection is not as large as LEGENDA and drink doesn't come with but it costs 2 euro. If LEGENDA is fully booked, you may want to try that one ? It is right next to LEGENDA."

The prices listed on the site are misleading - the price listed for cruise plus a la carte dinner is 8500 HUF, but as we discovered upon arrival - it doesn't actually include the dinner! You need to pay for everything you buy or pay 16900 HUF in advance and have the dinner included. So we just took the night tour and were retrospectively grateful we didn't book the one with the dinner. The cruise didn't take us any further than we reached walking around the city, so it didn't contribute any additional information or sights. Maybe it's better doing it on your first day in Budapest, so you have a general idea about the city and decide where you want to go. So... The city is gorgeous and if you are lucky to have a good weather as we did, the sights are very beautiful and impressive. And you can see all the most important monuments and sites in one hour. The audio guide is quite good and informative, but not always synchronized with the cruise and we weren't sure which building they were talking about. The free drink (we took red wine) was poor. There was no safety or emergency information provided, I suppose you just swim for your life in case of emergency. The headphone sets weren't cleaned or changed between cruises. In our opinion - this is absolutely NOT A MUST SEE, but if you do decide to take this tour, arrive early (we were there half an hour before start) and try to sit upstairs in the open part. It is colder there as the boat goes, but the views are worth it. You can get not a very clean blanket to cover up. And one last thing - it could be a romantic cruise, but once upstairs, you have only one row of chairs on each side so you cannot sit close enough to cuddle or talk."

We used English voice units that were close to being inoperable. And what we did hear was totally distracting. In fact I fell asleep. I think we would have done better to find a boat that offers a river crossing (or so I understand) for about $5. It would probably be more enjoyable and more cost effective."

After reading other TripAdvisor reviews about Legenda Cruise, my wife and I decided to try a dinner cruise with the company to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Booking online was convenient, and you must print your confirmation and present it to the hostess upon arrival. I would recommend that you asked for an UPPER DECK dinner table in that it is more intimate; there are only about five tables; and you get an outstanding view of the lighted buildings that remind me of Disneyland at night. The food was exceptionally tasty, well seasoned, and fresh. Try the pork loin cubes or duck breast. Even the desserts were made with care and a cut above other restaurants. Plus, there was live music provided by a singing duo. Our romantic dinner cruise will always be one of those experiences that include the word \"wow!\" to describe our time in Budapest. By the way, for the best photo shots of the lighted historical buildings and bridges, pick the early dinner cruise (starts at about 7pm).Thank you fellow TripAdvisor reviewers for this wonderful recommendation! :)"

There was lots of cruises to choose from but we went with this one because of the reviews and it did not disappoint, from start to finish it was simply stunning. Excellent price. The staff were all very friendly. Some boats seemed to be going very fast down the river but the legenda was very smooth and slow which is what you need to take in the stunning views. This really is a must do boat cruise when in budapest. Which we had time to have done the dinner cruise as that looked like a real treat. We booked the tickets on their website which was very quick and easy."

Food was very good - we took shrimps (it was quite little portion) and duck breast (that was quite abundant), yammy! Local wine Bock was very nice. The only minus is that the both decks were covered and it was a bit lack of fresh air, so to take good picture (especially of Parliament building) and to get fresh air one shoule have gone to tiny open place at the back of the boat. I still think that it was right to have less expensive ticket as we would not manage 4 course dinner which costed more than 53 Euro per person, drinks not included."

Do you still believe in legends?Well, I hear you: but only if they are not just stories but real too.Here is my legendary experience.Once upon... a month ago, it happened in gorgeous Budapest, Hungary's beautiful capital.The Danubian legend will not fade out of your musical memory, and now here you are.We simply thought that during the heatwave it would be nice just to spend an evening on \"The Blue Danube\" to the accompaniment of some classical tunes. Also, we wanted to take some pictures of the city's impressive architecture. We usually take a taxi crisscrossing the city, but what is better than a boat?Oh yes, the magic lies in the stunning view of both sides! Sometimes we even forgot to click the shutter button as the view in front of us was not a staged theater scene but an eclectic mixture of beautiful architecture and all the reasons visitors love to come to Budapest.No problem, the boat's captain understood that we forgot ourselves in the view, and the boat slowly glided in a zigzag along a long stretch of the Danube, when Buda and Pest's illuminated wonders appeared in the late sunset. This panoramic view engraved itself upon our memories.No talk, no fuss. The silence enhances the magic; the pleasant evening breeze cools you. The dinner is just delicious. No goulash, thank you. Instead, a sophisticated four-course menu to choose from. We of course, wanted the most out of it, and ordered different dishes at each course, and we can confidently state that the dinner matched the enjoyment.While at dinner you will enjoy live music. When we went, the audience were charmed and entertained by a singer who accompanied himself on the clarinet to complete the wonderful atmosphere.Time went by, and we woke up from this relaxing, wonderful dream, wondering whether our busy schedule would allow us a second time. As it didn't, the impression was completely and utterly unique."

Purchasing the tickets and boarding the vessel was a nightmare,Very poor organisation on the wharf itself. It seemed that all of the staff (apart from the lady selling tickets) were actually on the boat, so the wharf was a free for all. We had tour parties believing that they had \"priority\" boarding, who were busy pushing everyone else back. We just waited patiently and ended up getting a good seat anyways. The commentary from the headphones was OK, and the boat did what was required-took us up one side and back the other. What is definetly the highlight is seeing all the buildings and bridges lite up-it would just take you so long to see them all at night, and on foot. This is the redeeming feature of the cruise. The price, at about A$23 dollars, was also expensive, considering how cheap most things are in Budapest. I think the river cruise operators have the market by the throat-if you want to see it all, then you have to pay. Problem is, we wanted to see it, as well as many others by the fact the cruise was full, Add it all up and it is an average excursion."

They gave us the full two and a half hours and we passed the parliament building four times during the cruise, and it was glowing in golden light on the last two passes. Got some spectacular shots.There were three guys in the band, and they kept us entertained all night with some ambient music. Two of the waitresses showed their mastery of 6 languages between them introducing the cruise and then later winding up the night.

For night time cruises, arrive early and move towards embarkation point as soon as possible because as the scheduled trip time approaches, pushing and shoving ensues as people try to board first to get the seats offering the best views and some don't care who they offend by trying to push to the front!

There are no commentary on this cruise, so you can concentrate on eating and enjoying the view. There is a small outside deck on the back of the boat from where you can get better photos than through the windows. You can either prepay for a four course dinner, or pay only the cruise beforehand, in both cases you pick your menu on board. The prepaid menu includes one drink. You can find the menu on the company\u2019s website. I had the following dishes:1. Hungarian cold appetizers2. Cold citrus cream soup with a touch of mint raspberry cream3. Duck breast with rosemary in red wine sauce with sour cherry served with roasted potatoes and carrot4. Brownie topped with chestnut cream on the side with spicy plum ragoutYou would not necessarily expect to find high quality food on a this type of cruise, but this was one of the best dinners that I have had. The portions were large and the waiting staff was efficient and friendly. Budapest is a beautiful city on daylight too, but when the bridges and riverbank buildings are illuminated at night, the view is really breathtaking and a night cruise is the best way to experience it. With this quality of food, I highly recommend this tour!"

There are usually 4 cruise at night. Do book ahead online if you want to take the first night cruise of the evening. It does get full. There is a audio guide included in every seat. However, some of the English ones are not working and with any of these cruises, sometimes it will be difficult to catch the monuments that they are mentioning on the guide because of the cruise position. It is a good introduction to all the monuments along the Danube in Budapest and what lovely scenes at night. It can get cold and windy in the upper deck.For the perfect photo shot (day or night) of the Parliament other than on the Fisherman's Bastion is to take the tram 41-19 on the Buda side to the last station before Metro Batthyany ter.

(The regular sightseeing cruises run at night and are about 45 minute long).Of the 4 courses we had, 3 were very good while the main course was a bit messy and not very good. You get a welcome glass of your choice (it's not Champagne btw, unless it's very poor Champagne, so pick a beer if you want it!). All other drinks are extra.I felt the dinner cruise was half an hour too long; going around for the third time was a bit much and there was a massive gap between the soup and the main course, so time could be saved here. See if you can get a table on the upper deck (if there are just two of you) because you won't have to share it with other couples. Also, the live entertainment won't be \"in your face\".Saying all that, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."

We had champagne to sip while we set off and food was served. I have to admit, I wasn't too keen on my starter, Hungarian plate, but the rest was delicious: Pumpkin Soup, Pork and Barley with Panna Cotta dessert. Every mouthful was a delight. There was pleasant live music in the background and the views were stunning - all for around \u00a345. Worth every penny. We were going to call for a cocktail on the way back to our hotel but we were still full from our delicious meal, we called it a night"

We booked the inclusive package which included a glass of champagne when we boarded and a four course meal. I wasn't sure what the food would be like but it was really very good, and the live music was pleasantly subtle and not too cabaret-like at all.The 'candle' on the table is of course a battery-operated LED but for obvious reasons I think we can let that pass :) Very romantic, a lovely idea for couples or friends alike."

The boat leaves at Dock 7 (very easy to find and not far away from the Elisabeth Bridge). The boat leaves at 7.45 pm and takes you on a 2,5 hr trip. As I booked all included (circa 50 \u20ac pp) we had the choice of every hors d'oeuvre, soup, main course and dessert of the menu. First of all the boat is really nice. It is a real floating restaurant. The service was very friendly. You should not expect it, but this was the best dinner we had in Budapest. (Quality and presentation were absolutely top) While you are eating the scenery outside is marvellous. All main Budapest building are illuminated and you should even say that Budapest is more beautiful at night as in the day. We were really very very satisfied about Leganda cruises."

We took the one hour evening tour (ticket includes a drink) which lasted abut one hour. There's multi-lingual commentary available through headphones, which is reasonable quality. Budapest takes on a special atmosphere in the evenings and this was a lovely and relaxing way to enjoy the view of the stunningly lit buildings and bridges."

We opted for the four course package, and the food was stupendous. He had the duck breast main and I had the veal, we both had the pumpkin soup course and my brownie pudding was apparently a bit nicer than his panna cotta pud. Two and half hours with a man and woman singing and playing a keyboard, nice and in the background. Staff warm and well trained, drinks above the inclusive welcome drink were well priced (\u00a311 for a bottle of sparkling wine). I recommend booking early as we understood the earlier bookings, such as our own, got the window tables, although you were never more than two tables from the window, and there is a small outside viewing deck for after dinner. The buildings were gorgeous all lit up, of course. This is a lovely way to see this fabulous city without the usual super-tourist commentary. Highly recommended!"

The eticket was not in fact the ticket to board, so after getting to the top of the queue we were told we had to go back to the ticket office to exchange our eticket for another ticket. Most confusing as the eticket stated we had to show this to get on board.Anyway, once we got seated and had our glass of bubbly all this seemed a distant memory.The food and wine was fantastic and very reasonably priced. The restaurant was probably a bit too brightly lit and though marketed as a 'candlelight' cruise - there were no candles! The boat itself was nice but fairly basic - nothing like the same cruise in NYC and (especially) Paris, but not as basic as the Prague version.Budapest stunning at night from the river, but we went back and forwards a few times rather than carry on further down the river. Perhaps it was not so scenic, but it would have been good to see it anyway.The entertainment was basic but very good. A quartet singing and playing classic folk-type pop music, like Dylan etc. Not in national costume or cheesy at all, as I had expected.All in all a good well-priced evening with fantastic food, good service (once on board), and beautiful floodlit landmarks along the way. We stayed at the Marriott (see review) and the embarkation point was directly in front of the hotel."

My wife and I chose the a la carte 4 course dinner and were certainly not disappointed with a high class and beautifully presented 4 course meal. (The veal was to die for!) Welcome drink and then pay for your drinks with a very reasonably priced wine selection. Staff were excellent, attentive and polite and this was two and a half hours along the Danube that we will remember fondly. The evening that we went there was a splendid boy / girl duo playing (guitar) and singing which added that final touch- and certainly not obtrusive. Would certainly recommend this trip and will definitely do it again."

My husband and I chose to go on the A la carte candlelit dinner cruise last night, and both of us agree it was one of the best things we've done on this wonderful trip to Budapest. As we had eaten a large meal the previous evening, we did not feel like booking for the four course menu, and were perfectly happy to choose from the menu provided. We decided to share one of the starters, which the chef kindly agreed to put onto two plates for us (not just a spare fork like some others would give you), and a main course each, plus a bottle of wine. We like to eat out, and have to say that the food we had on board was excellent and beautifully presented.The waitresses/hostesses were very pleasant and helpful, and the lone musician who played a saxophone as well as singing made the evening even more enjoyable. But I have to say, the best bit of all was to see Budapest sparkling on the river banks...very spectacular. Our two and a half hours on board just disappeared!Thanks to all at Legenda...we won't forget our cruise on the Danube!"

The boat was completely full by the time it left (late) and included at least one party of schoolchildren and several families with very young babies. Sitting there listening to one of the crew members attempting to make an announcement, while babies screamed and the general chatter drowned out her voice, felt more like sitting in a hospital waiting room than going on a cruise down the Danube.I do realise that babies cannot help crying and that it is unfair to hold Legend responsible for the noise, but there were other issues.Worst of all, in my opinion, is the commentary. It is cheesy and stale and entirely unrelated to what you're looking at through the window, so if you intend to give it your full attention you will be spending the entire cruise looking up at a tv screen. You might as well be anywhere, instead of on a boat on the Danube. Why not employ live guides, with personality, offering shorter but more relevant commentaries on things you are actually sailing past? I gave up listening to the commentary, and after a while I gave up attempting to look out of the window too, because if you are seated in an inner seat it's a bit like being on a bus, looking past other people's heads through slightly fogged windows. The entire boat is enclosed, so no chance of any fresh air, and if it's crowded you are confined to your seat for the whole trip.The boat doesn't take you very far either - I didn't see anything that I hadn't already seen just walking along the banks of the Danube.No doubt it is an entirely different experience if everything falls into place but I wanted to let people know that sometimes it's going to be crowded, noisy and touristy-stale."

Not because of the text: it's interesting but honestly, could anyone remember couple of hours later who was the first king of Hungary? But the view! Just go and book it. For sure after 8pm. Brilliant!"

We had an hour-long cruise at 21.00.Budapest has to be experienced on a cruise the Danube, specifically at night illuminated bridges and buildings at the time. This is despite the Legend on a cruise. The ship was guided in several languages. The only minus was the offered drink, they did`nt taste good. But the most important thing was the view and I would recommend this cruise for all ages."

You are paying top dollar for Legenda versus the other boats down by the river. First the translation equipment did not work on the top deck .... after about 10 minutes they said they could not fix it and go below deck and find a seat and it should work down there..... it did. The other issue is that you can smell the boats exhaust/fuel while downstairs. So I guess if you want to kill some time without walking the boat ride may work, but I can't see how this can be so much better than the others."

We cruised on a Tuesday evening at the beginning of March, and the boat was practically deserted! Although it was quite brisk outside, the boat was warm and cozy inside, as it is an enclosed boat. The staff spoke English very well, and they were friendly and quite pleasant. The trip lasted for approximately one hour.It was fantastic to see the fantastic landmarks of Budapest at night. In addition, headphones were provided so we could listen to a wonderful commentary and watch a video on a TV screen about the sights we were passing. We were also offered a complimentary glass of champagne, wine, beer, soft drink, or mineral water during the cruise. The champagne was special treat! The cruise cost 5500 forints for each person, which came to about $24.00 US/Canadian. I thought this was a bit pricey compared to the deals we were used to finding in Budapest, but it was well worth the money. You can use Master Card and Visa to pay for your ticket at the booth.I would highly recommend this night cruise. Afterwards, I would suggest strolling along the Danube to see all of the sights again from the shoreline."

It was definitely not cheap (around 31000 HUF, or nearly $150 USD), but was worth it for what is most likely a once-in-a-lifetime trip for us.We arrived early after wandering the streets of Budapest, hoping the boat would be open for seating. Luckily for us it was. We were told when making our reservation that sitting by the window was not possible, but there was a large group of people sitting directly across from us, so their seating arrangements made it so we had a table for two right next to the window. The one drink included in the price is a choice of two house wines, juice, Pepsi, etc. if you want another type of wine or refills, you have to pay extra. There is a selection of food that is suitable for nearly every palate. I had a scallop as the first course, followed by pumpkin cream soup, roasted pork tenderloin and panna cotta for dessert. My wife had a shrimp starter, pumpkin soup, duck breast and sponge pudding. Everything we ordered was outstanding, and the servers are simply amazing and work very hard to keep up with the demands of such a large group.After having several drinks, several older couples got up and danced to the live music to everyone's entertainment. Also, the views of Budapest from the river at night are breathtaking. The only drawbacks are the staff has no way of controlling unruly children who ran amok between tables while their parents watched, seemingly amused by their children's bad dinner behavior. Also, the boat is not heated very well, if at all. After a while, the body heat of the approximately 50 people on board fogs up the windows and obscures the otherwise romantic views."

The pumpkin soup was even better. Then, to my pleasant surprise, the duck breast was delicious - perfectly cooked with none of the fattiness you get sometimes with duck. The red wine & sour cherry sauce was a delight. The meal comes with a glass of house wine, which was very good for a house wine. The music was nothing special, but it also wasn't too loud so it was easy to have dinner conversation. We didn't listen to the cruise audio and the constant circling did start to get tedious. But, it was really nice to see the city and the major attractions all lit up and the boat was cozy warm despite frigid temperatures that night.

As one of the most recommended things to do, we took a 2-hour afternoon cruise on the Danube.The Legenda appears to be the most touted cruise line for such excursions so we didn't bother to investigate alternatives. Perhaps the employees take for granted their name recognition and do not care about the quality of service? Not once did we hear from the ship's captain - no 'welcome aboard' or 'thank you for joining us'. Moreover, while the taped commentary is clever (the male voice represents Buda; the female is Pest) it is not synchronized with what passengers are actually seeing. Much of the time we saw landmarks that were belatedly addressed in the commentary after we'd passed those sites. By choosing the 2-hour tour, after an hour on the river, we were taken to Margaret Island by Anna, the Legenda guide who traveled with us on the boat. It is telling to note that she never introduced herself - I had to ask her name at tour's end. Unfortunately, this was a frustrating portion of the tour. Immediately upon arriving on the island, Anna met up with a girlfriend (presumably another Legenda employee because she was dressed in the company uniform) and appeared far more interested in socializing than leading an informative tour.She asked what the participants wanted to see (only 4 of us chose to explore the island with her) and I suggested the Alfr\u00e9d Haj\u00f3s Swimming Pool mentioned during in the commentary. Mr. Haj\u00f3s, Hungary's first Olympic medalist, designed the complex that opened in 1930 and in 2006 it was the site of the European Swimming Championship.Anna quickly replied that it was 'too far' but that my husband and I were more than welcome to walk to it. Clearly, she did not want to accompany us but would have been more than happy to see us wonder off on our own - which we did not.We chose to stay with her - frustrating because she and her friend walked ahead of us chatting and apparently 'forgetting' there were tour participants who were depending upon her for an enjoyable hour walking tour. When we walked past several concrete busts of presumably famous Hungarians, I asked who they were. She curtly replied 'they are writers' and kept on walking, again clearly disinterested and in a hurry. She may have sensed my disdain because shortly thereafter, she stopped and provided us with a short, perfunctory synopsis.Thirty minutes later, Anna told us we were on our own for the duration and to be back at the dock 15 minutes later to catch the return boat for the short ride back to the dock. Again, indicative of a disinterested guide. And once we arrived back at the dock, there were no words from the captain.In short, this was a mediocre tour done is an uncaring manner so if you can find an alternative, I strongly recommend that you do so. While cruising down the Danube is a must, doing so with this company is a must-not if you can find an option."

You will get many useful informations about Hungary and Budapest via headphones on 30 languages. Free WiFi on board and friendly staff will welcome you.My only negative experience was regarding their problem solving regarding my reservation - but wasn't disapponted at the end.

Being vegetarians and not finding any suitable evening meal for us, we chose the free drink cruise. Their pier is at #17 and from Hotel Regnum it takes a couple of short tram trips. We got there early and waited for about 45 minutes. Be warned that the temperature does drop quite a bit often (in May) and it is a good idea to have a jacket. The cruise cost us around $25 per person and takes better than two hours.Our cruise left around 8 p.m. The drinks were nothing to brag about. Our seats were comfortable and the translation headphones worked just fine. Just as the tour starts two young ladies welcome you in several languages. They alternated with the languages and it was funny to see them forget their lines many times! But the tour was wonderful. The boat first travelled along the Buda side and then along the Pest side. With gentle nightfall and all buildings nicely lit it was an evening well spent. It also gave us an opportunity to note the places we would like to come back during the daytime and see in greater detail. Overall it was a very good cruise we would recommend it highly."

The welcome was good, but rapidly we discovered that the translation equipment was not working at all on our 5 seats!!. We asked to get it fixed but this was impossible. We were asked to go on the bottom deck In the middle of the boat where the view was limited and the air pretty warmed: We decided to stay at our seat and just look at the beautiful views with no comments. We were given CD's to watch and listen the comments at home?. Their equipment are pretty old and they do not have anything to fix quickly. Our advice is that: Better you look for a better organized tour!"

The headphones are comfortable and you can actually hear and understand the commentary. The commentary provided good information on sights on both sides of the river. They provided one beverage on the way to Margaret island (water, soft drinks, beer or wine) and then on the way back they provided their \"lemonade\", which was basically sprite with lemon, but very refreshing. Both drinks hit the spot on a hot day. We were able to see more Budapest sights than we had just walking around. Would highly recommend their sightseeing cruise!"

The crew on the boat were very helpful coming around to serve drinks and making sure our headset was set on the right language. We didn't get off at Margaret Island but took the cruise that went around the island.We actually enjoyed the cruise so much that we went back at night to see Budapest lit up.

Kids under 10 are free. It was April 10, a warm sunny day, and we took the 11:00 boat. Initially, I was a bit disappointed that the seating was all inside, under glass, and the only outdoor seats were in the back (none on the top). So we sat in the front with the other 20 or so customers (not busy). Commentary on the headphones was informative and not boring, so we just enjoyed the ride to Margaret Island. From there, you can walk the island with one of the boat's guides, but I opted to do it alone (see my Margaret Island review). As we boarded the boat at 13:00, I couldn't help but think I just paid an extra 1000 HUF for a tour I didn't take. On the return trip, the boat was different, and this one you could ride on top (perfect). Sat up there and got the best pics of the Parliament building. On the ride to Margaret Island we got 3 .3L glasses of apple juice and I got a .3L glass of beer. On the ride back we got 4 smaller glasses of lemonadish stuff (tasty). Boats are an awesome way to get an overview of Budapest, but the price was a bit on the high side. 8600 HUF = 29 euro. Nice boats though, very clean, crew professional."

We told the lady it was for 9 people and she said it wasn't a problem at all. So, we show up around 6:05 and there's a HUGE waiting line. No one to talk to exept the lady who sells tickets. There's chaos and lots of people in front us us are angry. Later we found out why. One of the Duna Legenda employees passes by and we ask him if we can still buy tickets without a reservation and he says of course, when one boat is full there is a second one. Finally it's our turn, we ask for tickets and the lady says no tickets only reserved tickets for the 6:30 tour. Needless to say that all 9 of us left pretty dissapointed and frustrated as everyone is leaving in the morning and there is no more opportunity to take the tour. Once we got home we checked the website and there the information was faulty as well."

Headsets provide the audio describing the architecture and history in a multitude of languages - just select your language, adjust the volume, and you are ready to enjoy. Two drinks are included with the evening cruise - the first being champagne, the second is your choice.

BOAT - Danube LegendDeparture - 2015Package - Drinks only, no foodTime - 1 1/2 hrsWhat a way to finish our Honeymoon!! A boat trip on the Danube...I have to say that this was a fantastic trip out and I would recommend it to anyone coming to Budapest. We departed at 2015 and this seems like the perfect time in July. For the first half of the trip the sun was going down, and at about 2100 the city is transformed as the lights come on.I have truely never seen such a transformation, The lighting on the bridges and buildings has been designed to best show off the city, and WOW!! We took nearly a quarter of all the photos from our 4 day holiday in just 3/4 of an hour! We had not been this far out at this time of night on our trip, choosing to stay closer to our hotel for meals, drinks etc. I could not be more happy we choose to do this, as it was truelyy a brilliant end to our holiday.HOWEVER....If we did it again I'm not sure we would choose to go with Legenda. I have nothing to compare it against, so I don't know if this is representative of the standard in Budapest.From the very start of the trip we did not feel welcome. We turned up, and there was obviously a big tour who were going out on the same trip. Most of them were sat down, so we joined the queue to board the boat. When we got to the front we were very abruptdly told to wait to one side. The tour group were all then allowed to board in front of us. I am assuming we all paid the same price, so I don't understand why this happened.We then boarded the boat which smelt very strongly of diesel and were dissapointed to find it was completely enclosed by plastic, making decent photos a real problem. It was also very hot on a humid night and it would not have been a good experience to sit in here for the entire time. There were also no toilets on board, so could be a problem for some people.It was only when a couple of people across the boat from us started asking questions of the staff did we then realise there was an upstairs, which was uncovered. It was very small, only allowing two seat side by side with a walkway down the middle for the length of about 30 chairs. It would've by no means fitted everyone on. Initially only a small amount of us headed up here, and it was wonderful. No diesel smell, nice open air and perfect photos. I just don't know why we had to push to be allowed up here.The drinks came and were absolutely fine, a glass of sweet sparkling wine followed by choice of beer etc. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. And the commentary, while a little dramatic (\"I am the king of such and such and it is 1874 etc\") it was much better than sitting there silently.I am just very glad we were not in a full to capacity trip as I think the entire experience would've been very uncomfortable. If we also hadn't been able to get upstairs we would've been very upset as we would never have got the great photos I mentioned before, and would've been sat in the stuffy compartment the whole way.The trip was definately worth doing, I'm just not sure if Legenda were the company to do it with.....5* for the experience, but for the company which I am writing I can only give 3*"

Don't let the new looking Legenda boat fool you into paying twice as much, unless it is the drinks that attract you. I personally can go 1 hour w/out needing 2 things to drink.

I booked my ticket online, and i booked for the Margaret Island trip included in the boat trip, it wasn't until i got on the boat and read a pamphlet/map of danube (which i had to go searching the boat for because no one was going to give me one) that i saw the Margaret Island trip was going that day, i had paid extra for it and the staff told me it was my fault because on a page somewhere on the internet it stated that, yet when i went to pay they gave me the option to book it (scam)! Then we sat on the boat, which was glass roofed, it had been snowing and they hadnt cleaned the snow off the glass window so we could see a thing! Included in the ticket price was a cocktail when you go on the boat and then a choice of beer, wine or soft drink to follow. When they came round with the \"cocktail\" the boat had just started pulling out into the river, the drink wasnt a cocktail but a glass of hot tea, not alcoholic in the slightest, so complete false advertising there. As the vile tea was being given out (which was actually pretty cold) the commentary started. The Legenda pride themselves on the fact that their recorded tour guide speaks in 30 different languages. So we picked up our headphones attached to the little devices hooked on the back of seats, and felt ill, the headphones were FILTHY! They were the type you receive on planes but they had been used a million times over rather than being presented to you in a sealed polythene bag as they usually would be. Luckily i had my own headphones with me from my ipod but my partner had to use the mucky ones which we cleaned as best we could with anti-bacterial wet wipes. We plugged our headphones in and selected English but all we got was Hungarian, we tried every channel and still only heard the same Hungarian voices. A few Italian people opposite and in front of us were also looking around very confused, when we tried to ask the male and female members of staff they told us \"IN A MINUTE!\" and ignored us, about 15 minutes went by without us being able to hear anything in English, i was losing my patience and asked her again, she just told us to move to different seats, we did as we were told and then found that the ones we moved to had no sound coming out AT ALL! We moved again and finally got some English, but its not like we could see what we were looking at anyway as the windows were all snowy and steamy. Then came the drinks, my partner had a beer and I, a red wine, it was so bad it was completely undrinkable. One of the recorders then fell off the seat it was attached to and straight into the glass of beer, so in all we had had NO drinks whatsoever!!The glass roof was leaking in many places, and one was right next to me, all over my coat and the next chair!The toilet taps had no running water and the staff weren't exactly helpful!All good reviews should be completely ignored, this is the WORST TRIP EVER!!!"

There are fantastic views of the Parliament, Buda Castle, Chain Bridge and Vizivaros to name a few, and the cruise plods along at a great slow pace for photo oportunities or relaxing with a loved one. Ask for the special Rick Steves discounted price, make a reservation (not required) and enjoy one of Europe's most beautiful riverfront views."

Two drinks, including wine were included in the price. There was audio commentary in many languages available on headphones, The commentary provides some information on the buildings you are seeing along the waterfront. The downside of this trip was the crew, all four of whom spent most of the cruise inside the captain's glassed-in compartment at the front of the boat, laughing and talking loudly. Sometimes the noise was so loud we couldn't hear the audio commentary. Much of the time the captain's back was turned away from the front of the boat while he was chatting and at other times he propped his feet up on the control panel. Very unprofessional in my book! I would pick another company next time."

We also took of those glass front ones - Company Name: Legenda off Pier 7 and Boat Name is Duna Bella (off Pier 7). It was very expensive (4900 HUF) but definitely worth it. There is a cruise at 10pm that has a discount - I think it is 30% so maybe that is an option if you are on a budget, also i think the day ones are cheaper. It was very informative (maybe a little corny) but interesting. There are multiple languages and you get 2 free drinks. The city is lit up and the beauty was overwhelming! The only downfall was that the day trips go around the island, which I think would have been nice."

If people have a problem with tourists, I don't think they should work in the tourist industry. Also, the bus does not stop at all, so you can't get good photos. I was sitting on the right side and most of the sites ended up being on the left. During the water portion, the bus turned around right at the parliament building also making it difficult to get good photos since the building is huge.The tour was over priced. Budapest is really walkable. I would suggest taking advantage of a free walking tour and doing a separate cruise on the Danube for a third of the price."

Booked online to go on this river ride and to start we found it impossible to find we asked a handful of local people including people working cleaning the road and local security men and no one knew where it was until we stopped at the four seasons and asked and he pointed out a man dressed in a costume standing at the taxi rank. No sign anywhere to say where it was, we walked around for 45 mins looking for this. We then waited and waited and waited to be finally told that the trip would not be going a head. No apology we were just told to go back to the office. There were 4 people in the office and only one person dealing with the situation which meant a long queue. When we got to the top we were asked can we come back tomorrow to which we replied no we have other plans tomorrow. We were not asked to come back any other day or when did it suit us. The river ride employee dealing with us told us that we would be refunded with the company we booked it with which was fine but when I asked for some sort of receipt to prove I didn't go because it had been cancelled and I would be guaranteed a full refund I was looked at by that employee and her colleague as if I had ten heads !! I had been let down by this company,no explanation to what actually happened and no apology then when I ask for something to prove I would get my money back because I simply did not trust these people I was looked at like a freak and I did not appreciate the huffing and puffing out of the employee !! I would not recommend anyone to go to this because you are not guaranteed it will go ahead and if it is not safe to proceed with the trip that is perfectly fine, health and safety must always come first with these types of trips. But a customer is paying the money, they should receive an apology at the least of the trip they paid for has been cancelled. the customer service of this company is awful !!"

The ride downstream is also very entertaining, passing under the famous bridges and passing the parliament. The tediousness starts after turning upstream towards the landing again. Sometimes it feels that the (Bus/Boat?) is barely making walking pace and so most of the time of the tour is taken up going upstream passing sights which you have already seen on the trip downstream. It would be a great improvement if they just created another ramp downstream so that you just had to pass the sights one way (or get a bigger engine to go faster, but that is probably not possible)."

The pick up was next to 4 seasons hotel (we stayed at the Sofitel - a stone throw away)- Well recommended for the young and old.

He was delighted that his Grandpa was entertained by the interesting technologies involved (especially on climbing back onto land). He was very proud of both us for answering some of the questions asked by the guide and winning some presents to show his parents. Joseph was thrilled to make the first ever sighting of the big river house for the kings and queens of Budapest, so he carefully ignored his oldies silly babble about boring government buildings. Joseph was a little embarrassed by his grandparents getting excited about the splash into the river. Afterwards, he carefully demonstrated to us the correct (cool) way to behave on guided tours. Definitely no squeals of excitement. Apparently you look away and think about missing your ipad games. Actually, this was a hilarious send up from observation of his friends and teenaged step-brother and step-sister.

We tried it after a suggestion and after I read some very negative reviews, and even among the 5 of us we had different feelings after it, but I think that generally I do recommend it for everyone, it's something unbelievable when the sight seeing bus goes inside the Duna, Danube, and it continues the sight seeing tour from there. So it's basically a sight seeing bus that makes a tour in Budapest with a guide who speaks English, German and Hungarian, but you can choose other languages on the earphone, which has advantages and disadvantages as well, because it's a pity that we can't listen to all of them (or more than one) for the same time, because they all have a different style, the tape has music, but can't react on the actuality, so this is a problem, but I think it was only my problem. It takes one and a half-two hours all together, and it worth to bring cameras, because it's a lots of fun to take pictures from the river, although we can't really see from pictures that we are in the bus in the river.I think that that was the best part of the whole tour, of course, when we entered to the river, but it was also very interesting when we went out of it... I think it definitely worth it, even if it's your first time in Budapest, and even if you want a new kind of sight seeing, or just having fun with kids. Actually it's even very fun to see from outside that a bus is floating on the river - and it's free to see it from outside! :)"

Floating on the river with a bus is fun, though since the vehicle is closed, it is mainly a good idea in bad or cold weather. Otherwise the open boats are clearly a better choice for the Budapest Danube sightseeing.What unfortunately lessens the otherwise great experience:- staff treat passengers with minimum attention;- the guide makes little effort above what is required: e.g. when we had to go on a detour, or during the second half of the trip, she was unable to keep talking;- the guidance told is only about half correct (but that's an unfortunate average figure in Budapest);- The routing is flawed, probably due to a lack of suitable exit ramp down the river. The bus should float down the river, exit there, and take a different route back to base. Instead, it forces its way up the river (only being able to do half speed), then just returns to base without further things to see. Thus basically the second half of the trip is a bit useless and boring, in a confined space.- Frankly, the price is rather high.If the routing were improved (worst case: construct a ramp somewhere further down) and the staff a little more trained and attentive, this could easily be a must-do attraction.Till then, while an interesting experience, but if you can do it, you probably profit more overall from a boat trip and a bus trip separately, especially if the weather is good."

Pretty much the same sights as all of them, though this is a bit less in that department as they save the time for the boat ride, which is the real reason you are there, after all. The water entry was delightfully corny with the music and commentary. Ignore the bad reviews about this part. Again, this is the reason you got on the bus/boats, so stop being a killjoy and enjoy it!. Water entry was a hoot! So bizarre driving a bus into a river. The views from the water were great.

When we saw this hilarious amphibious bus in Budapest, we thought why not? on our last day. So glad we did it. We took the 10 am tour. It was mostly couples with only one child (who was quiet and well behaved- thank God!) we got coffee and snacks at the costa which is right where the bus takes off. We listened to the tour in English ,outlying, and sometimes to the live guide. We learned a lot about Budapest in a really fun way. The bus was cool and comfortable. The fact that it was raining meant we wouldn't have been out walking as much Nd this seemed to be a perfect activity to do in the rain. I will admit, the splash was a little scary. Once we were floating though, the novelty added to the sightseeing experience. Sit on the left if you can!! We took lots of pics, both on land and in the water. People took lots of pics of us too :)We went far past the parliament so not sure what happened on that other reviewers tour?It wasn't cheap, but we found the experience to be well worth it."

She reminded me of listening to a flight attendant go through the safety procedures before a flight. Stick to walking tours where tour guides rely on tips, you can always rely on them to be people who are genuinely passionate and enthusiastic about their cities. The fact that you're inside a bus that's always moving also makes all the landmarks or 'sightseeing' seem less real.Redeeming factors: you do get a great view of the houses of parliament from the river. Some of the tour-guides jokes are so poor and delivered so badly that you get a laugh out of it."

Everybody got a headphone to follow a prerecorded disk which had no intonation at all. You could follow a live guide in german through the same headphone with very bad connection. Even though that part was live, there wasn't a lot of enthousiasme. They didn't point out the buildings, just at your right or at your left, so that it was sometimes hard to know which building it concerned. The trip took actually 1 hour and then an other half hout of traveling back. Half of the people on the bus fell asleep during the tour because it was that boring... Beter taken another tour with a more enthousiastic guide..."

He had no idea that the travel agent had booked this for us, we were both were very surprised and excited when we arrived at the meeting point. We were taken on a tour of Pest to begin with before splashing (literally) into the Danube. It was funny to see everyone staring in disbelief at us from the river banks. The guide was lovely and engaging and knew lots of great facts about the city and its history. We live on a sailing boat and this was a sailing experience neither of us will ever forget.

However, if you switch your headphones to Channel 1 you can hear some slightly confused sounding people reading a script written by the genius travel writer Andr\u00e1s T\u00f6r\u00f6k, author of the brilliant \"Budapest: A Critical Guide\". I laughed when he told me how Freddie Mercury offered to buy the Hungarian Parliament, and cried at his moving description of Queen Elizabeth of Habsburg's love for the Hungarian people. I think the tour guide noticed I was not listening to her but that's okay. T\u00f6r\u00f6k's script is read with rather poor editing and pronunciation but it's still marvelous and worth the price."

She did a little quiz at the end to see if we had been paying attention...I managed to get a question right and got a special wee fridge magnet.

While in Budapest earlier this month I had the pleasure of touring Pest (the vibrant, lowland district on the Danube's left bank, opposite Buda) with RiverRide, a combination bus-boat vehicle that motors down the avenues and plies the waters of the Danube. The tour, lasting somewhat less than two hours, provides an ideal introduction to the city and offers splendid vantage points too numerous to count. Starting near Chain Bridge, the vehicle drove past Pest's major sights, including the Parliament Building, St. Stephen's Basilica, Dohany Street Synagogue, the Opera House and the attractive buildings of Andrassy Avenue (a lovely, tree-lined boulevard styled after Champs Elysees), which leads to the Heroes' Square, with its grand monuments and museums. Along the way we passed 'Book Cafe,' an art nouveauextravaganza which is located above a bookstore (the former Paris Department Store) and which offers a gorgeous backdrop for afternoon coffee or tea. (I went the next day.) When it reached the river north of the city center, our coach plunged into the Danube and headed downstream. Views of the Parliament Building on the Pest side and the Castle and Royal Palace on the Buda side were nothing less than spectacular. Our knowledgeable guide, who spoke both English and German, made the trip back upstream (against the Danube's strong current) go by quickly, dispensing useful information and even quizzing passengers at the end! Just when we felt we were on overload the guide let us enjoy the city for a few minutes in silence. Because the tour ended a bit early (due to light traffic, I believe), we were treatedto a crossing of Chain Bridge before returning to our starting point. All in all, I recommend RiverRide as a convenient, efficient, and highly enjoyable orientation to a fascinating city. Do this first, and you will know what you want to revisit at your leisure."

Usually my wife and I prefer to walk around to see the city, but today we had a nasty weather and didn't feel like getting wet, so we decided to take this tour.The vehicle is a weird combination of a bus and a boat. It rides on wheels on the road like a normal bus, allowing you see the city like any other tour-bus, but then, after 45 minutes or so, it arrives to the Danube, goes into the water and turns into a boat, allowing you to view the city like any other tour-boat. The guide was very nice, and the tour was a real success!"

Overall the trip was fun with a knowledgable and funny tour guide. It's a great way to see the sights of Pest but we were disappointed that the coach did not go to cross the Danube to the Buda side. If you want a complete tour I would recommend another organised event.It was enjoyable when the bus ventured into the river and the sense of occasion was made more enjoyable with the music when entering the Danube. There was some mention of not standing whilst the bus was in the water due to balance issues which is understandable but the co-driver displayed a very aggressive attitude when I slipped to an opposite seat to take a picture of Parliament on the other side. The bus/boat experience exists as a sightseeing enterprise so I was taken aback by the attitude of the member of staff who could have asked me to remain in my seat in a more polite manner. This incident spoiled the event and if I realised you could not swop sides for a better view and to take pictures I would have booked a cruise tour instead, at a much lower price."

It is important to mention that I studied English for 5 years and use it almost everyday. Apart from that the \"fun facts\" that she was mentioning on the ride were not very interesting.

Music by Strauss was played at the same time when there was a big splash when the bus hit the water, it was hilarious. As our bus was sailing on the river we saw all the main attractions from the riverview, which was a wonderful exprience.We have participated in many guide tours and can really say that our tourguide was excellent, she spoke fluent English and German and had a nice sense of humour when she was telling her stories about Budapest and Hungary.

Our friend had organised this trip and we thought we were going on an ordinary city tour and, as the day was really warm, were a bit disappointed he hadn't gone for an open top bus. This proved to be far more interesting and novel! The guide was excellent and clearly fluent and articulate in a number of languages as the commentary is adapted to suit the tourists on each trip. The journey on land took in the key sites of Budapest but the river part of the journey probably gives you a better feel for the city with its two distinct and very different parts. This is not the cheapest way to see Budapest but perfect if you want a good overview at the start of a holiday or city break, plus the novelty of a bus that suddenly goes off road and into the river! I agree with another review that suggests that this might not hold the interest of younger children (the boy in front of us was about 9 and was clearly very bored apart from when we splashed into the Danube and when we emerged back onto land again). Would certainly recommend, if only for the fun of seeing the expressions on people's faces when you go in and out of the water!"

It is fun, educational, informative and a good value. Don\u2019t let the price make you hesitate \u2013 while it may feel pricey it\u2019s an excellent value for the experience.They were very responsive to my email enquiries. Adrienn, the tour guide, is a lovely individual and made the tour very enjoyable. I loved the information she shared. The bus driver was very polite \u2013 I appreciated that he was so courteous to the pedestrians. It\u2019s these little things that make me proud to have engaged their service. The \u201ccaptain\u201d (he drives the bus in the water) was a fun individual as well. Our little toddler loved the \u201csplash\u201d in the water and was thrilled to be in the water.

The guide knows her stuff and the tour is conducted in both English and German which is you have both nationalities on board can make it a little hard to follow but no drama.

It's not for kids, it's a tour of historic Budapest with interesting facts but nothing to engage children, yes the bus floats but that's not enough to keep a kid happy. The moment the bus drives into the Danube is novel, but then it's simply like any other boat on the river, except that it's a bus, passers by wave and look a little puzzled but that's about it. We wanted something that would give us a quick (1hr 45 min) over view of Pest which this did admirably, showing us where things are and what's available, so we thought it was good, and my husband particularly liked the idea it was an amphibious vehicle.

DON\"T WASTE YOU TIME OR MONEY! one positive... the Jaws theme as we entered the water was clever ."

The woman/guide spoke in english/german/hungarian and first the busdriver took us on a tour in the Pest side of the town, than we made a \"splash\" into the water and it was funny :) Than we were going on a tour on river Danube and back. The tour took us ap.1,45 hours and it was worth to go. Recommend it strongly for both people who are coming for a weekend like we did and people who are for longer vaccations too."

We were really looking forward to it as it seemed so cool as idea. The part of bus city tour was ok, showing interesting sights and telling stories about them. Our guide was a fine young lady that tried to scare us a little (in a funny way) before we went into the river. They even played some theme from Odysey I think :)The bus came into the Danube and started sailing but after only few minutes could smell something strange. The bus stopped and they opened bottom to check the engine and it turned out that water in engine is overheated and that we need to leave the bus. Fortunatelly we were still close to river bank so we slid to nearby ship that allowed us to get onboard and go to land.The company Riverride kindly got us taxis that drove us back downtown and offered us another ride next week, but as much as I could see noone excepted. Unfortunately no money refund was offered as the tour was only half delivered.Please don't get discouraged as the expirience is unique, but they should get a message to make better maintenance and not to jepardize tourists that come in good trust."

We wanted to do a river cruise as well as see sightseeing spots away from the Danube, so the idea of combining the two in one tour was a great one! The tour guide was great, good English and good, sometimes very entertaining German was spoken. The driving was very comfortable, and we got to see many of the relevant spots. Unfortunately the Danube had a lot of water that day, therefore the part of the river cruise was extremely short (10 minutes) and not done for sightseeing but only for the sake of going into the river. In my opinion, this should have been mentioned upon purchasing of the tickets or latest when boarding, this way it felt a little like a tourist trap... Anyway, it's a fun tour and you get to see a lot of the city, so it's recommendable!"

The novelty wasn't worth the cost and one can get to know the city in cheaper and more enjoyable ways. My view is maybe more negative because I had already gone on a free walking tour, which was interesting, informative and fun. This wasn't any of the three.It was so boring as the guide droned on and my partner had a hard time keeping awake. She did not present a comprehensive story of the history that anyone was likely to remember when going through the city on water or land. Maybe others will get lucky with a better guide/crew. The presentation of the \"oh so exciting moment\" of going into the water was done in an exceptionally cheesy and half-hearted way. Plus, of course for safety reasons, everything is sealed and air conditioning, which may not be fun in the summer, so no 'fresh' air. It's also rather expensive (approx \u20ac30 per person) and besides the short thrill of going into the water it was no better than a lame bus tour or boat tour.Yes, it's nice to see the sights, but another time I would just take a cruise on a regular boat and enjoy the breeze, do a walking tour or take a tram."

It starts by giving you a good introduction to sights on the Pest side of the city and then continues on the river Danube, giving a wonderful view of the city. This is the first amphibious tourist bus on the Continent and I recommend strongly that you give ti a go at the start of your visit to this beautiful city. - The tourist guide on the bus was very knowledgeable and witty at times. - You find details on www.riverride.hu and you might like to look on YouTube as well, such as http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQIadebptgU&feature=iv&annotation_id=annotation_328107 ."

Couldn't find any reviews before my wife and I went to Budapest but we loved the trip and think this is well worth doing - if a little more money than other excursions. The bus/boat leaves from Roosevelt Square on the Pest side of the river and goes around the main sites in the city. It's one of those journeys that is good to help you get a feel for where you want to go back to. Then you go to a slipway into the river and SPLASH! We were lucky in several ways - firstly it was a calm day at end of January and we only crossed one other boat on the river so no wash. Secondly within 2 days of doing it the river was covered in ice and the trips stopped for safety reasons I imagine.The boat part of the trip takes you down past most of the main buildings on either side and you turn just after going under the link bridge and go back to the slipway to get back on dry land. In all the excursion lasted just under 2 hours.Comments:1) our guide was good but could have had slightly better English (but then she was doing German as well)2) the vehicle sways a little on land but felt fine in the water - probably not the best if you suffer from motion sickness3) try to get the front seats to watch yourself going into the water4) it's a pity the boat part stops short of seeing Gellert hill closer, as implied by the website intro5) you don't go to the Buda side so no views from Castle hill but we knew to go there anyway"

The gentlemen working at Best Way Segway were so professional, caring and wanting to provide my children the best and safest experience. I was very impressed with how they were always concerned for my children's well being. They sent two tour guides with us so that they can keep an eye on both boys. Great job you guys! You have done a terrific job and we wish you all the blessing! Terrific job!!!"

Given the distance between the sights, and the steep hills a Segway is the perfect way to see the Buda side sights. Not sure we would have been able to see everything without the convenience of the Segway. Our guide, David, was wonderful. Rather than rattling off a memorized spiel, our tour felt like having a friend showing us the town. David was very patient, funny and personable. He was very safety conscious, always watching to make sure we were okay. The machines were well maintained. St Matthias church was an unexpected delight; my favorite church in Eatern Europe! We highly recommend doing a Segway tour, particularly with this operator!"

After a good introduction we went throught the city up the castle hill.Great views, not to difficult, not to easy.Time for pictures and as an personal wish, a coffee, were given and after that we went down again and back on another bridge.All in all: best trip this year so far, so strongly recommended!"

I will say they were very nice and tried but we did not learn anything about what we saw besides the name of 3 places. We did Segway in Prague and loved it so thought we would do it here. Waste of money if we wanted to know anything. I did tell them at beginning of tour we could come back later for a guide who spoke English but they said no it's ok. It was not ok."

As a result, we would definitely recommend this activity and Best Way Segway Budapest!"

The two older kids had their own Segway while the 6 year old rode with me.The tour was customized to meet our needs as we wanted to see the castle and a particular memorial. It was about 30 degrees fahrenheit so we had several stops during the tour for coffee and warming-up. All along, Bela and Esther were great hosts and kept the kids entertained.

His information about the city made it really easy for us to get around on our own in the days after that. Not only did he make this a really good day out, but both of the suggestions he made for places to eat were exactly as he said they would be.

In the lead up to our trip, Budapest Underguide were excellent with regards to replying to queries and tailoring a tour to our requirements. However, at the point of service, this excellence was not translated. Although clearly an interesting character, Levente's English was not at the level I would expect for a tour guide and he was not proficient in leading a group. He often began talking about sites whilst people were yet to arrive at the point in question and it was often very difficult to hear what he was saying. Added to this, the company had sent him a different itinerary to the one that I had been sent - I had been promised that a drink and a 'surprise' were included in the package, neither of which were provided. As well as this, I had expressed an interest in more contemporary features of the city - of which none were visited. To be fair to Levente, when it was realised that this mistake had been made, he was very regretful and he worked overtime to help us in doing some shopping at a supermarket. However, the itinerary mix up is such a basic mistake especially considering the price, and although this price was reduced, there is no way that \u20ac20 per head was justified. Having visited Budapest in the past, I would strongly recommend the free walking tour over this service as it offers a more organised and clearer experience of the attractions in the city."

There was live jazz music, lots of local handicrafts (music boxes, Christmas decorations) and lots of food stalls selling sausages, goulash, bratwurst, and on and on. One food item I have never seen anywhere before: chimney cakes. The cake batter/dough is applied to conical cylinders and then cooked over a charcoal fire. Before serving, they are rolled in what looked like a sugar/cinnamon mix and then dropped off the cylinders into a bag. Becuase they batter is scored before baking, the customer can easily pull off strips to nibble on."

I answered the questionnaire and marked art and architecture as my main interests and was appropriately assigned Virag as my guide. As I understood, most of the guides at Underguide have other jobs. Virag, for example, works on art and cultural projects and is much in the know with the contemporary art scene. It was interesting to speak to her on normal every day life in Hungary. Who knew, unless you are up-to-date with world news, that there is so much discontent with the present government. Perhaps she didn't know every fact and date for the buildings and historical sights but who really cares when you can read that yourself in a guide book?"

Before we left home we told them what our interests were and they ensured that we daw those things - several of which wouldn't have been on a traditional tour. We were picked up (on foot) at our hotel and walked through the residential area where our guide grew up and even saw her high school which was interesting. For long distances we hoped on trams or the subway. She took us to the Shoe Memorial along the Danube which was very moving. It's where the Nazis made Jews line up, remove their shoes and then they were shot in the back and fell into the Danube which carried their bodies away. We also went up the hill on the Buda side of the river and saw magnificent views from the Fisherman's Bastion and walked through some charming streets. I could go on and on but the basic thing is that this is a personalized, fun and informative experience that I highly recommend. Just be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes that can cushion your feet on cobblestones."

Our tour guide Eszter Talab\u00e9r was wonderful. She met the group at a local hotel and asked where we were from and made an effort to remember. Throughout the tour she referred to us as Pittsburgh, or Italy etc, which is a neat trick that makes one feel special. From the hotel we walked the chain bridge to the Buda side and saw many exciting sites on that end. We then boarded the metro train back to the Pest side where the tour continued. Mid way through the tour we stopped at a local bar and had a beer (or wine depending on preference). The cost was reasonable and included the drink and train tickets. Eszter is energetic and engaging and has a wealth of information on Budapest. More interactive than the big bus tour. I would highly recommend Eszter. I also recommend to wear comfortable shoes."

We started out at a small deli type store that was so hot we had to wait outside. We then moved to a place where we tried sausage, very tasty, but I was shocked that it was 93 degrees out and eggs are left out on the counter, not refrigerated. Huge health issue there!! Our guide was surprised when we said the US health department would shut you down for that. Then we went to a really cool building that we thought was a train station, but it was a massive food market. We had delicious langos and a Hungarian cabbage dish.

On the form I provided the various aspects of Budapest that I was interested in- art, quirky shopping, Jewish historical sites, etc. I am a solo, female traveler so I figured this one-on-one tour would be a great introduction to the city. My tour guide, Cilla, met me in the lobby of my hotel at our arranged meet-up time. This is great because I had yet to venture out on the public transport. Cilla even brought me some typical Hungarian sweets as a little treat. :) Off we went to the bus to head into the city. We spent over five hours wandering around the city on foot and on all forms of public transit. I got very acquainted with the ins-and-outs of the subway system so I was able to get around easily during the rest of my time in Budapest. Cilla was very knowledgeable and the tour really did seem like I was walking around with a friend! It was so much fun and really opened my eyes to what Budapest has to offer. I also made sure to try many local foods and drinks during our tour. I loved having a \"native\" bring me around and introduce me to so many wonderful foods I never would have known about on my own! I also got a little lesson in Hungarian language- very fun. Budapest Underguide is honestly one of the best aspects of my trip to Europe this summer.When I inevitably return to Hungary with my Mom, I want to do another Underguide tour that offers a different \"theme.\"Thank you Cilla!"

We were looking at activities one week prior and after contacting Underguide, they had sent us a questionnaire asking us about what periods of art we were into, what medias, and other things that we were interested in seeing. We were especially interested a private tour since we were curious to explore more of the \"underground\" art, and learn how Hungarians suffered from artistic expression for the latter half of the 20th, and the exodus of creative minds. I think we had high expectations just from the questionnaire itself. Zsuzsa was supposed to be our guide for the tour and we were pleased to hear that she was into photography. However, she was ill the day of our tour and Orsi was our last minute replacement. I wonder if our schedule was the same or not, but of the galleries that we visited, most of them were closed, or not really worthy to be included on a tour since they had no exhibitions, or they were just pointless. Orsi tried her best and I think that she was very helpful and knowledgeable about Budapest and history in general, but not for the type of tour that we had asked for. It would have been appropriate to have a guide that had more of an art history background, and who made sure that all the galleries that we wanted to attend were actually open. The main reasons I am not rating this tour poor is because we were to a local gallery that was artist owned and operated, with very friendly curators, who were willing to let us browse through books and rooms in the back. They had an amazing collection and I got to see some beautiful pieces that I would not have seen in the local museum. The gallery was called \"Prestige Gallery\" and I strongly urge everyone to check it out if they have the time. Second reason is that were had some delicious expresso as a pick me up at Printa. While we were there, we read about a shoe shop with vintage Hungarian sneakers from the communist era and wanted to buy some shoes, so we made a pit stop over there for a while. It took longer than we thought, but we were still able to get through the tour on time (but only because everything else was closed). I think that this tour in particular could be improved. There were some excellent sites along the way it was very relaxing, and I did learn a few new Hungarian artists. Prestige Gallery was the highlight of the tour for us."

By then end we felt like it was a friend showing us round. If you're only in the city for a short amount of time then booking a tour with Underguides is money very well spent. After the tour you'll have the knowledge and confidence to really visit the city on your own.Simon -Managing director Road, Rail And Sea"

We walked along narrow cobbled streets and explored a side of Budapest not normally discovered. Our tour took in English and American history and Zsusa pointed out places of interest and statues that we would have overlooked. Zsusa also went to great lengths at the end of our tour to make sure our spa tickets were ready for us which we greatly appreciated. We can highly recommend Zsusa and her colleagues to provide anyone with a different insight to this wonderful city."

My brother and I went to Budapest for what was supposed to be a weekend of oblivion and instead of feeling isolated and foreign we ended up blending with the true essence of the city and we owe that to our very dedicated guide Vera S. with whom we discussed a variety of subjects from music to history to architecture while walking the streets of budapest as if we naturally belonged there. Allthat was derilict became beautiful and all that was nameless gained a meaning. Truly recomend. A heart-warming experience for those who loather guides with distorted microphones on top of a double-decker."

The tour is made to your individual requirements so I said that I wanted to see parts of the city where locals would visit, see some unusal sights and sample local food and places to drink. The tour started with a trip of a market then followed some of the religious and university buildings with information on the changing political situation in Hungary and information of how joining Europe had affected the country, we stopped off for food in a quirk cafe and then visited some amazing little bars that I would never have found on my own in the arty bohemian part of the city. We visited the Opera house and chatted about life in the city. It was a real eye opener and something different to do. I don't like people reading from scripts or loads of historical facts so this trip was perfect for me, I'm sure my guide would have been able to provide me a lot more facts but I wanted to hear more fun stories and about the quirky side of the city. For the price it is very good value bearing in mind that the tour takes 4 hours, is carefully planned out and the guide is very experienced and highly trained. The office staff are very quick to respond to queries and requests."

Discover Budapest is worth doing, you learn a lot, you get to see places that would be difficult to get to otherwise, it can make your trip a lot more interesting, you get to see a lot more of the city.If you are on a budget you can chose a guide book and make use of the river ferry passenger boat service, a good option in Budapest. The scheduled service on the Danube is between \u00dajpest and Millenniumi V\u00e1rosk\u00f6zpont with 8 stops North to South: \u00dajpest - Meder utca - \u00c1rp\u00e1d h\u00edd - J\u00e1szai Mari t\u00e9r - Batthy\u00e1ny t\u00e9r - Pet\u0151fi t\u00e9r - Bor\u00e1ros t\u00e9r - Millenniumi V\u00e1rosk\u00f6zpont, my last use of the boat cost me less than \u00a32, so that's what you call a saving and you get to meet ordinary local people which for me is a big plus side of doing as the locals do. Transport links are pretty good here."

Anniko took us through the Grand Market where we ate and drank a wide variety of Hungarian dishes (including Unicum, Langos and Hungarian sausages). We then took a walking tour through town where we stopped in a restaurant for lunch and then a coffee shop for dessert. We wrapped things up at a small wine bar for some tastings of some local wines. All along the way Anniko illustrated the landmarks with great descriptions. She was very personable and fun. I would recommend that if you take this tour you don't eat beforehand (like i did :-)).

Our guide was knowledgeable and pleasant- though she would have been better if she'd been equipped with a mic system. We hopped on the historic M1 line and took it from the Opera to Freedom Square. A walk through the City Park was delightful then back on the Metro to St. Stephen's Square and a strudel stop (included) nearby. A walk over the Chain Bridge and then up the stairs to the Castle was beautiful if a bit strenuous. We walked from the Castle complex to Matyas Church & the Fisherman's Bastion to end the tour (about 4 hours total), never entering a building but talking about them and history all the way. We spent our next three days in town feeling far more comfortable using public transport (a single ticket is good for unlimited rides on buses, trams and the metro for one or more days). We also were better oriented and earmarked places to which we subsequently returned."

We chose Discover Budapest based on the excellent reviews and we were certainly not disappointed. Our tour guide George was absolutely brilliant! He had a great personality and explained everything so well in plenty of detail but also in a way that didn't bore your socks off! Even the part of the tour that he claimed to be the \"boring part\" (as a joke) when we went over to Hero's Square wasn't boring at all it was actually really interesting! He was very knowledgeable also when we enquired about restaurants and Hungarian wines to try. He took his time with everything he showed us, we didn't feel rushed at all and you definitely get the sense that he thoroughly enjoys the work he does, as he showed plenty of enthusiasm. Definitely go on a walking tour with Discover Budapest (especially if it's with George) well worth the money and it's great value for money also. The strudel place they take you to during the tour is so so good!!! YUM!!! Thank you George you were awesome!!!"

Had our reservation yesterday with Discover Budapest, and from the moment we walked in the shop, which just happened to be located right next to the magnificent Grand Opera House, we were treated superbly. My wife and I hired a private guide named Balint. Can't say enough wonderful comments about this young man. Ran us through a short training and safety session to refresh our other Segway experience, very precise and helpful. He quizzed us as to where we had already been in Budapest and tailored our tour to new exciting sites ! Travels down busy Andrassy Ave. , stopping to talk history and architecture, culture and more . On to Heroes Square with detailed and fascinating review of each of 14 Kings and Rulers from Hungarian history. Ask Balint a question , he gave answers and more ! he was attentive, engaging, polite and often quite humerous ! On to the famous Szechenyi Baths, back down other side of Avenue, stopping at House of Terror for review of the terrible /Soviet occupation, wow !! On to Freedom Square, the Bascilica and surrounding sites . This was just a very fun and exciting 3 hours with Balint, if you go, try to have him guide. Most importantly, he was ever conscientious of safety while on roads, bike paths and sidewalks, and courteous to citizens and other travelers on tour !!!!!! We plan another Discover tour by Segway when we get to Prague,you cannot beat this mode of tour for fun, information getting the feel of a city, our favorite !!!!!"

Our small group of 5 were all trained by our guide Balint, which was as described about 20-30 minutes. Afterwards we slowly made our way to the first stop, crossing streets and stopping. Balint expertly explained the history and uniqueness of the Opera house, as well as some of the detail of attending the peoples opera. Afterwards we did the same in each location along the tour. Balint would take photos if requested, and guided us cautiously through some of the more crowded areas (we had a morning tour which I imagine would be a little less crowded than afternoon tours). My wife says this was perhaps her favorite tour ever, and I agree. Where else can you learn about a city, and have fun moving through it, no tired feet. There are a few restrictions - which we didn't need to worry about, but make sure you read up before you book. Segways are Gyro balanced, so it's all about balance and trust, but just about anyone can ride one. Book a tour - you'll have fun, and learn some cool things. Book the extended tour - we wish we would have now that were done."

Budapest is a beautiful and surprising city and seeing in while riding a segway helped us see a lot more of it than we would have walking.Our guide was Balint. He was enthusiastic, funny, attentive and full of historical information. He was able to provide great commentary on what we were seeing and he had great answers to all of our questions.We were provided with safety instructions on how to operate the machines and then we were off scooting around the city. In the end out 3hr tour turned out to be 4.5hrs and every second of that was entertaining, mostly because of Balint, but partly because riding a segway is a lot of fun. I gotta get me one of these machines."

We had a big group on the day, but he paid attention to everyone (not an easy task while navigating the busy streets of Budapest with a sore throat!). He also gave us tips on other places to see in Budapest. Thanks Tamas for being a great introduction to Budapest!"

I'm really glad we did as this 3.5 hour walking tour was excellent. Our guide Brigit greeted us warmly and was fun and witty throughout. In the tour we covered many of the main sights, including the Opera House, Hero Square and The Chain Bridge as well as much more. Also included is a quick stop for a snack at a lovely restaurant for two strudel slices and a drink (included in the price). We liked the restaurant so much that we went back again for a another meal later on. Be warned that there is a short uphill walk to Buda Castle which looks imposing at first, but I'm very unfit and I managed it without any problems. Overall I would recommend this to others, especially if you only have a short time in the city. The tour flew by as it was so interesting, and it's definitely worth seeing as much as you can of this beautiful city."

Brigit was thoroughly professional, considerate to all members of the group throughout the tour, and always sought to see if anyone had further questions. She was pleasant, informative and mixed useful information with the occasional joke to lighten the experience. While her tour was relatively conventional, that by Georg was very much more personalised, with only my partner and myself as the tourists. For the first hour he shared with us the details of the 1956 revolution, using photographs of the time and mementos from his own collection, and then the second and third hours were spent walking to the appropriate sites. His commitment to the tour, and to Hungary as a free nation was impressive and added to our experience. Both tours are thoroughly recommended."

Our guide, Kati, was very nice and was good at sensing how much information we wanted about the things, we saw. She could answer all of our questions and made the tour very exciting. We ended up on a restaurant with a very nice traditional cake - which name I can not remember - and had a good talk with the other persons on the tour.

She was a big reason we ended up loving Budapest. She spoke English perfectly and was not only knowledgeable, but conveyed a love and passion for her city and country. She could answer any question posed and often knew what someone was referring to without even turning around to see what they were pointing at! She did not give you fake dopey anecdotes (as some tour guides do thinking they need to entertain). The trip was 3.5 hours and included a subway ride (the price included all museum and transport fees) that is not to be missed. Built over a 120 years ago, it is quaint and really brings you back in time. Wear comfortable shoes, but this is an easy walkable city tour with few stairs."

He speaks several languages, including English, and he was invaluable as a translator when we ventured beyond Budapest. Ask for Jozsef - whether you need a guide for a few hours or for a longer tour.

Our first tour was an overview of Budapest as a city with Kati. We went to the Heroes' Park, several stops in the center of town, and ended the tour in the castle district. Kati was so kind, knowledgeable, and informative about the history of Budapest. Our second tour was the \"Hidden Gems\" tour with Tomas. We mostly focused our tour in the Jewish quarter and learned a TON about the history of Budapest. Though we had been in Budapest for 4-5 days already, Tomas still found sights and told us stories we had not known about. Tomas was again, like Kati, an excellent guide who was so enthusiastic and entertaining throughout the tour. I highly suggest any \"Discover Budapest\" tours for couples or families!"

To be honest it was my first time in europe . honestly i didn't know anything about the budapest (actually about whole europe) when i landed to hungary. and i can tell you i was so lucky to choose the walking tour and seg way tour from the discover budapest. and specially the great thing was my tour guide the brigitta was great with guiding. as i didn,t know anything about hungary she explained everything for my well understand A to Z, and not about hungary ,she explained about the histroy of Austria and about the Roman emperers too. and i asked soooo many question about hungary and the second world war , my tour guide was so kind to answer my all of the questions...so i felt so good with the tour of walking and to be true, i learned about the europian histrory from the brigi than what i learned from the school)))))) and next day i went for the segway tour also and i was fortunate as my guide again was brigitta. first i was so scared to even step on the seg way as it was my first time but always my guide was so supporting to me and teached me how to manage the seg way. it was so wonderful tour and i felt like i am flying without wings in budapest city. Great feeling ,and the Budapest is so beautiful city and my holiday was wonderful as i choosed the tours in discover budapest and as i got the best tour guide ever in the world.......Thank you !"

From the start everyone was welcoming and excited which started us off on the right foot. For this particular tour, you begin in the basement of the tour facility that they have all kitted out with Communist era furniture and decorations. You sit in this recreated apartment and learn about the parts of Hungarian and Budapest history that you're most interested in (Tamas gave us a full run down but asked our preferences of older or more modern history for focus). He showed us personal artifacts from his family's experiences with communism in Budapest. Then, he toured us around various sites, monuments and other parts of town with historical significance. Since we had a small group tour (and me and my husband were the only ones who booked that day) it was incredibly customizable and personal. Tamas was knowledgeable, professional, funny and engaging. He even gave us restaurant and other recommendations for the duration of our stay. I absolutely recommend this tour company, specific tour and tour guide!"

They do show you the metro station and cover the cost of taking the subway for a portion of the trip.The stop along the way for strudel and coffee is nice and didn't feel forced.

Bikes were well maintained and easy to ride. We covered a lot of distance in 4 hours and loved the coffee and strudel break along the way. Gabor gave us history lessons and political commentary at each stop so that we have a real appreciation for the beautiful city of Budapest... and the beginning of an understanding."

It is quite sad that more people are not aware of how marvellous Eastern Europe can be, the weather can be very wet at times, even when raining it be can be 22-25 degrees. There are many attractions and buildings and the food and transport is very cheap. On average a taxi across the city costs about \u00a36.00, the average meals around \u00a310.00, you must try Goulash Soup it is best made in Hungary."

We had originally booked it for the Saturday - however, we got a bit lost finding our bearings and missed the tour! The staff were very helpful and helped us rearrange for the following day at the same time, which we really appreciated. We were very happy that we rescheduled as it was only the two of us on the Sunday morning, so Anna was our 'personal' guide!Anna's impressive knowledge made our tour fascinating, and her passion for the city was infectious. She showed us around at our own pace and my boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our day! Anna recommended other places for us to visit and see for the remainder of our time. The tour was our favourite part of the weekend, and would recommend it to anyone visiting Budapest. Thanks Anna!"

It could have been exhausting but actually it was completely inspirational and an absolutely perfect way to start my first trip to Budapest.The tour managed to fit in an incredible amount in within the three hours. My guide was Anna, and she is obviously highly knowledgeable about Hungary.What really made this such an amazing experience, however, was Anna's ability to adjust the tour to my interests. At the start of the tour she asked particularly about my experience of and interests in Hungary. Even beyond this, however, even during the tour I believe that the information and sights that were included were in response to interests that I had expressed during the tour (Successionist architecture, for example). I believe that this was possible because of Anna's very wide range of knowledge, but there was also an extraordinary level of professionalism in ensuring that I saw many sights of interest and had an enjoyable tour.I highly, highly recommend this organisation. A huge thanks to Anna for a wonderful introduction to beautiful Budapest!"

His pace was good (we're a 62 year old couple in decent shape), and his english was perfect and his voice projected well. This tour is a good way to start your visit to the city because you get familiar with it, and it uses two subway rides so you learn how to use the Budapest subway system. We also like to start our visits with walking tours because you can get information from the tour guide about how things work in the city - money, buses, taxis, restaurants, etc.The strudel stop at the end of the tour was very tasty, and we went back to that restaurant for dinner the next night."

Szolt was a SO informative, patient with questions as well as slower walkers, and made us feel very welcome. You start the tour in the basement, which is set up like an average home in Budapest in the 1970s, while they were still well under communist control. This was absolutely brilliant! It gives you a candid picture of life in that place and time. Szolt shared a synopsis of the history of Hungary (as a nation and a people). Then, he showed us actual school workbook from an elementary school child, dating back to the communist era. He even showed us some communist-era personal items belonging to his family. Next, we hit the streets. We learned all about uprisings and changes of govtt, explanations of several monuments, which are tied to the Hungarian political struggles, and various communist-era installations. This is the bulk of the tour, and is packed with information. We recommend starting your Budapest visit with this tour, as it gives you an excellent framework of this beautiful city.After a lengthy and eye-opening tour, Szolt gave us a recommendation for a restaurant, which was out of this world, too! Thank you, Szolt. You're the best!"

She didn't walk to fast or slow and was considerate of everyone in the tour. The stop for coffee and strudel was a highlight and much appreciated. There is so much information about this city I can't put it all here because everything we did turned our great. We plan to use the same group in Prague and I hope they are as good."

We only had 3 days in Budapest and they really made the most of it. We did the Absolute Walking tour (awesome, great overview of Budapest) and the Hammer and Sickle tour which was the coolest tour I've ever been on. The Hammer and Sickle really got into the interesting history and the fact that as an American I was exposed to a whole other part of the world: the former Soviet regime. I definitely recommend doing both tours if you can. The guides were amazing, friendly and thorough and the experience was the best!"

A little disappointed, but the sights we saw were really worth the trip by boat or by car. Our guide was very informative! Well done!We took the Absolute walking tour and that was great fun as you get to use the metro and get to see some fantastic sights around the city. Must do! Our guide Tomas was Super!"

Anna turned what could have been a typical day of tourism into a day of being welcomed into the Hungarian family. She is a true professional -- her breadth of knowledge and understanding is unsurpassed. But beyond her depth of knowledge, her people skills and her relationship skills make her truly exceptional. I would welcome her not only as a tour guide but as a friend. After touring the Eger castle/fortress, we had lunch at a local restaurant she recommended that was filled with locals and not tour busses it's where the food was amazing and each course was paired with a local wine. After, we went to the valley of the beautiful women and spent the afternoon at the Biro Biro cave. Beatriz, the owner, conducted our tastings and she was a true gem. We were welcomed as a part of her family and her wine tasting experience was one of a kind. She is a true Hungarian gem and we we're honored to share her phenomenal wine. Anna was a true joy and professional to spend the day with -- I would recommend her to anyone looking for an interesting, laid-back and knowledgable guide with whom you can learn more about the region. Five stars no question."

His english was excellent and knowledge and history of Budapest was outstanding. He took great care of us as we zoomed down bike lanes in the equivalent of Piccadilly Circus during the rush hour. It was a bit hairy at times but he took good care of us. His passion for his city brought it to life for us. The 2 hours soon passed and I'm sure he was relieved that we had made it back without any mishaps. It was a great experience and I would recommend it to young and old."

The trip proceeds at a moderate pace, is not strenuous and provides a fascinating introduction to both Budapest and the turbulent history of Hungary, which Andi was able to summarise succinctly. The trip takes in many but, of course, not all the main sights. Andi is clearly very knowledgeable; however, in my view she struck the right balance, by not overloading us with too much information. She was also very happy to answer any questions we had. Overall, it was a very enjoyable and useful orientation trip. Thank you Andi!"

It was a little weird at first as we were taken into the basement of the tourist center where they have a room set up with decor of the era, the \"time capsule\" as they called it. Anna was anxious to provide a background education prior to the tour and her enthusiasm shone through. The tour doesn't take place in the basement so don't worry about it. Anna and Robbie enthusiastically showed us various parts of the city and discussed the country's political history. They also explained architecture and culture. We particularly enjoyed two metro rides, one on a communist-era metro line and the other (not sure if was a plan or a coincidence) on a more modern one. If you are interested in modern history this is a recommended tour. Tip: the tour does not end where it starts and is a bit out of the way so plan on getting back to the center via metro or taxi. If you like to walk we walked back to the center quite easily via Raday street where we stopped for a late afternoon snack."

It was very hot but we still covered a lot of ground. I think you want to be in decent walking shape to do this tour as the walk up to the Buda district is a fair workout. We took the streets instead of the stairs as it was 33 that day. The stop for strudel was also tasty and fun. The hero\u2019s park part was a little long but that could be just because of the heat, I might have enjoyed that more if it would have been cooler. I would recommend both our guide and this tour we certainly learned a lot about one of my new favourite cities."

Though we used our own bikes there were no bike issues with the group and the tour itself was informative, well-organised and interesting with our guide Gabor. The last part cycling through traffic may have been a little stressful for less experienced cyclists but it wasn't for very long and everyone got through it without incident! Highly recommend the tour as a great way to see all of the main attractions in a short period of time."

The walk is beautiful, and Brigit answered every single question I could think of. My parents are both history professors, so I knew they would want to know details about everything from Roman times to Hungary's joining the EU, and Brigit knew detailed facts about all of it. She was very knowledgeable and welcoming to the city and the country - it was a really nice way to spend the days after four solid days working jet-lagged at the University. My favorite parts were her great stories about the monuments in hero's square, as well as the stop for strudel near St. Stephen's - try the cabbage and the sour cherry - both are incredibly good! The view up near Buda castle at the end is worth the walk up the hill (I didn't find it bad at all, but might be hard if you have mobility issues). Brigit also suggested we bring water and I recommend this too!"

With only a few days in Budapest, I wanted a good overview of the city and the Segway tour fit the bill. You cover so much more than you could otherwise just walking and you don't miss out on any of the personal touch that a walking tour provides. I was part of a group that started with five and my friend and I opted for the extended tour and after 2 hours we had our guide, Tomas, all to ourselves for an additional hour+. He was very engaging, knowledgeable and he loved questions. In addition to the big must-see sites, he showed us some other interesting things which I otherwise would not have seen. Reading some of these other reviews, it sounds as if Discover Budapest has some great guides, Tomas included. Highly recommend."

The meeting point is easy to find. Our tour guide was Brigit (on the morning of Friday 2nd May 2014) whom was very polite, knowledgable and kept the small group of six of us (three parties of two) interested throughout the three and a half hours. The pace of the walk was excellent and we visited Heroes' square and city park which we would probably never have done or ventured to had we not done the tour.The walk up to to the Matthias Church & Fisherman's Bastion would not suit everyone, but then you would not be doing the walking tour if you didn't like 'a challenge'. The inclusive visit to the coffee shop for patisseries helped beforehand. A nice touch and a good idea.My advise to all who visit Budapest is ditch the 'hop on, hop off' bus tours and get your feet on the ground. You see far more of the city and having a good tour guide gives you a clear informed visit and the chance to ask questions the buses do not give you...and you'll feel fitter as well! A good basis and starting point, if like us, you need to know the way around before tackling in more depth on your own later in your visit to this lovely city.We did fancy a go on the Segways, but only having four days to see everything, we ran out of time.Thank you Brigit and Budapest Tours for a nice tour."

My wife and I were the only two on the bike tour that day, so we have a private tour of the entire city. This also made it very easy to obtain lots of pictures from different angles without having to deal with large tourist crowds.Bernadette guided us though all the major sites on both the Buda and Pest sides of the city, proving lots of history and stories at each of the stopping points. We were treated a comprehensive history and cultural lesson at each of the sites, and Bernadette answered all of our questions with enthusiasm.Cycling is Budapest is safe and easy. Bernadette did a great job signaling and indicating our route. The bike lanes are protected from major traffic.The bicycles are very easy to ride. Because of the frequent stops and length of the stops, you are never out of breath or sweating. The bike ride has one hill climbing up to the castle district on the Buda side, and the Pest side is essentially flat. Total distance covered is between 6 and 7 miles which, over 4+ hours is essentially a very relaxed paced. If you know how to ride a bike, this is a fantastic way to see the city. We highly recommend Yellow Zebra if you have a day in Budapest."

The card also gives you access to the National Museum and National Gallery and other sites at no extra charge. You can also get 10 to 20% discounts at many other attractions, so it is well worth the money."

He would answer any questions you have related to Budapest, from directions to how to pick up girls in Budapest (the question posed by another tourist in my group). I asked Laszlo if there are any vegetarian Hungarian food and found out he's actually vegan! He recommended me a vegetarian restaurant, and I did end up going there for dinner.

There are so many attractions to visit such as The Parliament Buildings, The Royal Palace, St Mathias Church, St Stephen's Cathedral, Fishermans Bastion, and many more.No visit to Budapest could be complete without a visit to the Thermal Baths and Spa at Szechenyi. They are easily accessable on M1, the oldest underground in Europe.I spent a day there and loved every minute of it. They must have the best public transport system in the world. Anybody over the age of 65 can travel free on all public transport around the city. If you are thinking of going there for dental treatment I would highly recommend The Implant Centre on Margit Korut.The staff there, from the girls at reception to the dentists and dental surgeons and nurses are second to none.If you are lucky enough to get Dr Nameth ( dentist ) and Dr Klink( dental surgeon )you will be treated very professionally. It would be hard to find more kind and professional people. If you are looking for a basic comfortable hotel I would suggest you try Hotel Papilon which is only five minutes walk from the clinic.The staff on reception could not be more helpful and informative. If you have a few days to spare I suggest you take a train to Vienna.The journey takes about two and three quarter hours and costs 29 euro rreturn.You can purchase a 48 hour travel ticket for 12 euro and travel on trams, underground or on the buses all over the city. Hope this is helpful to somebody."

He knew well the sights and some core history. But if your looking for history that goes back to 700 AD, you would be best to take a Trafalgar tour. We were perfectly content with all the information that Victor dispensed. And it was great to spend the time with a younger generation Hungarian resident. As luck would have it, our guide also did the afternoon walking tour through Pest. So we had some lunch and met up again at the Discover Prague office. Another great tour and perfect afternoon.

Very reasonable prices.The card included a walking tour of Buda and Pest. We had the pleasure of having as our guide a gracious young woman named Anita. She led the AM Buda and PM Pest tours. She was very knowledgeable and was happy to answer any questions. She also gave out maps at the end of the tours and marked restaurtants etc.She grew up during the occupation so she shared insites into the past and present times. Her English was excellent so there were no communication problems. We stayed at the HIlton Hotel which is located on the Buda hills not far from many of the interesting sites. I highly recommend the Budapest Card as it also included unlimited use of underground and buses."

The guides were extremely knowledgeable and their English was really good. I'm not a walker and was a bit worried about doing 2\u00bd-3 hours of walking but they were both quite gentle and suitable for all age groups - just wear comfortable shoes. We learned a lot about the history of Hungary as well as about the parts of the city we were taken to. Really worthwhile and highly recommended."

We had our two tours the same day (Nov 11th) with a great guide called Tamas. He was really nice, gave a lot of anecdotes about the city... in two word we had a perfect time in visiting the wonderful city with him. We don't know the other guides of this independent company but if all of them are good as Tamas we highly recommend you to have visit of Budapest with \"Discover Budapest\". Also, be attentive during the tour because Tamas will ask you several questions about the history of Budapest and try to challenge all the participants in a quite funny game... the winner will have the honor to get the \"Mysterious price\"... it is really funny and we found the idea interesting..."

We visited the main attractions of Pest from the Heroes\u2019 Square to the St. Stephen\u2019s Basilica.The walk was average with Tomas.He gave us 1000 years of history from the nomad founding fathers to the present. Tomas knew his subject well however I felt the sites were only part of the main stream and he often went into too much detail instead of making the sites memorable."

Guide 'sophie' was slightly late which meant we were slightly worried we had done something wrong (meeting point at deak square was correct though large area). However she did bring a sign so we werent confused when she turned up. Took us to 3 bars and a nightclub. Had good company with some americans and french. Had a free shot at each place plus a pizza slice after 3rd bar. Bars were different with different selections of beer and other drinks. Guide was friendly too. Be prepared that some in tour will use it as a chance to drink to drop. We decided to leave at 1pm after last free shot at club as we had train to vienna next morning. In context, we prefer night tours that include some history such as literacy tours and this wasnt that but still enjoyable."

When we left our hotel earlier in the day the weather was dry and reasonably mild, however by the time we met Zsolt at 2pm.it was pouring with rain and we had no coats and no umbrella! We very much enjoyed the tour, although we did decide to miss out going via the Parliament Building due to the heavy rain. On a dry day it would have been great! We had already been in Budapest for three days by the time we took the tour and possibly the tour would have been more advantageous earlier on in our stay, however we still learnt a lot. Zsolt was very knowledgeable about the city and it's history. He was very easy going and friendly. Normally the tour would have lasted for around 3 hours and we thought the tour was good value for money. We were slightly disappointed to not have the whole tour but that was our choice due to the weather. We would definitely recommend the tour and would happily do it again (but without the rain!) Thank you Zsolt!"

Two different, but equally fasinating tour- Andi took us around BUDA and the castle area the first day. She gave a very complete tour and also added in her personal feelings on the historic events -which was special. Then Tamas, who is incredibly enthusiatic, marched us around PEST the second day, for at least 3 -4 hours and really gave us a fun, educational tour with quizzes (!) as there is so much history to absorb in a short time. The beauty and the history of Budapest is so incredible that you can easily spend a week exploring the city.

It was essentially because of Peter that I could do the two tours back to back, each of which lasted for about 3 hours. I\u2019d highly recommend this walking tour to everyone."

Our experience this trip has been that as it is shoulder season, the tour groups are quite small anyway and the guides all darned good, we were going to be in Budapesst for 8 days, so why not just get an overview from a company recommended in Rick Steves' guide book? We are very happy with our decision. Anita did a fine job telling us about her city and showing us the highlights. We had a perfect base for further exploration. Thank you, Anita! I also wanted to take a cooking course and in the end took one given by chefparade arranged for me at very short notice by the Discover Budapest staff. This went perfectly. I had a great instructor, Cecilia, whom I met at 9 am outside the Market. We cooked up a virtual storm including a Gerbeaud cake which takes a lot of layering, let me tell you!Thank you to the team at Discover Budapest! Great job."

This trip met exactly what I wanted: getting to see lots of the sights (such that I could choose to follow up on my favorites with more time later), getting moving on a bike, and being out in the sunshine. Our guide wasn't initially very talkative, but when we asked questions, we learned more about what Budapest citizens like most about their city now, and also what life was like under Soviet occupation, which was particularly interesting. The group was small (around 10 people) and we saw sights on both sides of the river. This trip included quite a bit of urban cycling, but there is enough of a bike culture in the city that there weren't any problems in the traffic of other vehicles. Would definitely recommend to others!"

Both my wife and I have ridden Segways several times before, so didn't much training, so focused on practicing how to navigate some of the curbs we would encounter. I'd recommend the 3 hour tour as you get to places where you don't see other Segways. Safety was also clearly of greater importance to this company as we were kitted out with nice crash helmets. We saw several other Segway groups and none had crash helmets. So we'd recommend this company, the 3 hour tour, and Victor as your guide for can't miss fun!"

We booked this tour after having a good look from a distance to the \"free budapest walking tour\" group that meets by the lion fountaine in V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty square. We saw the 2.30pm group and it was a small multitude of quite young people (60-80 pax) that was being divided into 3 smaller groups. Nothing wrong with that but that was not what we were looking for. We found the Absolute Walking Tour on tripadvisor and managed to book it online for the next day. We even got a taxi to pick us up at our hotel for a fixed price (a mere 7\u20ac).As for the tour itself, I would recommend to do it as soon as possible upon arrival to Budapest. They cover most of the highlights of the city in about 4h, but that means that there is almost no time for actually visiting the landmarks / attractions themselves. Once you finish the tour it's much easier to know where to spend your time based on what you liked the most.Our guide Tomasz is truly passionate about Hungarian history and knows a lot of interesting trivia and details about all the places we visited. He also managed to engage the entire group into the tour as we all made lots of questions that he was more than happy to answer."

In addition, you were able to go on two walking tours for free. We went first on the Buda tour, which encompassed the outside of the main sites of the Castle district including the Mattyas Church, Fisherman's bastion and Castle itself. Our guide was Laszlo and he was excellent bringing the various phases of history in Budapest alive with his descriptions of how modern Buda looks like it does and how the culture of Budapest has evolved.On the second day we went on a tour of Pest with Laszlo again our guide. This tour takes in Heroes Square, St Stephens Cathedral, Parliament, Freedom Square and the Opera house amongst others. The tour is 2 and a half ours long but Laszlo managed to keep it interesting the whole time and the time just flew by.After both tours Laszlo stayed around and answered everyone's questions on where they wanted to go, how to get there and also recommended a few other things to do.All in all the Budapest card was good value for money and the tours were excellent.Iain and Emma"

I bought a 48 hour Budapest Card (NOTE - buy these at a hotel or somewhere where you only pay the face value...at moment 7500Ft for 48 hours....and do NOT buy at the train station for example where they mark up the price. Also note - get florint at an ATM and avoid the horrible exchange rates..you need cash to buy the card.). Once you have the card you get to ride all the public transport for free and also get two museums free and the TOUR! Took the 1030 tour Buda tour that leaves from in front of St. Mathis church...hang around the statue in front and you will find the guide. Luckily, I had Laszlo and it was great. He gives more than just the standard history and fills in with stories and folklore so you will remember the tour. He also played the national anthem on his flute at one spot on the tour...very moving and gets you into the spirit. I would rate this 1.5 hour tour as very good if I had to pay...and Excellent considering it was free. He answered all the questions and gave just enough information and discussion (not too rushed to cover everything) that I felt good and learned and appreciated the history of Buda (pest) (not confused over what was where later).

After meeting on check whole group went together on the ship where twas welcome drink and dinner waiting for us. Main reason for poor rating of this attraction is that there was not a single word about attractions, buildings and POI during the cruise. In fact it is just cruise with average dinner and that`s it. Since this was our 3rd visit to Budapest we pretty much know all the buildings but I`m sure rest of group did not know anything. Food is just average just, classic catering/take away - nothing special with bad glass of free wine. Maybe it was our age - we are in our late twenty and there was a lot of older people there. In my opinion the segway tour or bike tour during the night with a guide can be way more fun and educational."

The tour ended in a charming wine cellar in basement of the Discover Budapest office for a tasting of some local wines."

This part of the caves is not as beautiful as the stalactite cave area under Buda, but the journey is more authentically spelunking, as the route has not been adapted for tourists. Be prepared for chutes, narrow passages, and climbs!The website we booked from, absolutetours.com, had several pieces of information wrong, including the meeting place, but we found the group in the end and all else went smoothly."

Budapest is a beautiful city, with most astonishing architecture and fascinating history, but it was our tour guide Laszlo that made the city and its buildings speak to us and open up. We listened to him play the flute, we laughed, we even danced in the park and we just all became friends.

I was in Budapest with my friend for only 3 days and we bought the Budapest Card that includes among many things also 2 free walking tours. In Castle District our tourist guide was Anita and she really told us very interesting and important things. She didnt just filled us with numbers and facts about history like many guides do but she explained the manifestation of history in nowdays buildings and events. I think that the tour was very refreshing and not boring at all. At the end she gave us maps and she marked what we wanted to see and told us how to get there, what bus to take, so that was very helpful. In Pest our guide was Barbie and I really liked her energy, enthusiasm and her sense of humour. The tour was about 2 hours and a half, I think, so it is good if you have a big bottle of water with you, especially if the day is so hot like ours was.I am very happy that we went on these two walking tours because we didnt have a lot time in Budapest and we have seen almost all the things that we wanted to see and really get the informations that we needed and felt the heartbeat of Budapest which is the most important :-)"

With all the interesting information given, the tour did not feel long at. The strudel and coffee stop, which is included in your ticket, was a wonderful way to break up the walk. We didn't go in any of the sights, but I was able to go back to the sights I wanted to visit inside later in the afternoon. Budapest is a very walkable city.

The weather was great, but there was 15 of us to begin with. the four of us had experience with segways, but the others, quite a bit younger, did not. it was Penecost and most of the stores were closed, but the streets were teeming; the cafes were doing a brisk business and tourists were enjoying the sights. On this trip we learned how to go off curbs and up on to curbs, which was a new experience. On other trips there were handicap ramps. It was a bit challenging, but not really difficult. It was a bit more challenging to dodge all the people on foot. the younger riders were a bit competitive and horsed around quite a bit; we just let them get ahead of us so we would be out of harm's way. Many of the sights we visited we had seen before, but we did get a new perspective on some. Our guide removed the governors off our segways in the central park and we were able to really zip around with plenty of room. This was a great tour, but I had really rather be with a smaller group. You stop frequently to take in the info the guide gives you and to rest and regroup. This is not a cheap tour, but lasts about 1.5 hours and is well worth it. there are snacks and souvenirs as well as a bathroom at the office."

So we had no choice but to end the tour after the first part. So we didn't get what we paid for. A lot of people plan multiple excursions in one day and tour companies should be aware of times posted for the tours they run.

Andi was our tour guide for the 3 hr walking tour, she is extremely knowledgeable and leaves plenty of time for you to take pictures ask questions. She actually makes the history of Heroes\u2019 Square and the Millennium Memorial interesting, as she walked through each statue we enjoyed her comments and information. The Vajdahunyad Castle was one of my favourite things to see. If you are a person that is not in shape get ready for a hefty lung work-out as you trudge up the stairs to the Fisherman's Bastion on the Buda side of the river...I thought my lungs were going to explode...Andi was patient and waited as my old bones made it up the hill. This tour guide never rushed at any points and although I know we put her behind in her schedule, she never once made us feel rushed. She is an EXCELLANT tour guide with a wonderful use of the English language.Our morning 10:00 a.m. walking tour was wonderful, as we visited 80% of the sites before it became to hot. The stop for freshly made strudel and coffee, was a welcome break and to see the strudel being made before our eyes was a treat as wel. If I ever go back to Budapest, which I plan to I will definatly keep this tour company in mind. Wishing Andi the very best from Canada..on her future studies~!"

On the first day, I did the basic walking tour of the city with Anita as the guide, and I thought she was great. We got to see a tremendous amount of the city, and she did everything at exactly the right pace. She's extremely knowledgeable, and also has a nice subtle sense of humor. We stopped at a caf\u00e9 for some wonderful strudel, and while we were eating, she did a personalized map for everyone in the group to give recommendations for other things to see and do in Budapest. This was one of the best group tours I've done anywhere. Later in the week, I also did their Night Stroll and Boat Cruise tour. the guide for that tour was less enthusiastic, and much of the information for the first part of the tour was the same as I had received on the other one. That wasn't the fault of the guide, but if the two tours are that similar, then the company should say that in their publicity. For the final hour of the tour we took a night cruise up and down the Danube River, which was wonderful. However, the cruise part was run by the Legenda group, and the tour guide did not even go with us. This is something that I could've booked on my own. I loved the cruise, but the earlier part of the tour was not necessary."

Anita was very knowledgeable and still showed great passion and interest for the city. We loved the stop for strudel and coffee. A very nice touch was that Anita took the time to give everyone on the tour personalized tips based on what kinds of things were of interest and where your hotel was, and marked these on a free map. We felt like locals showing up at the restaurants. Do this walking tour on your first day! Price also great - tour took a total of almost 4 hours and we paid 32 EUR for 2 adults (pre-book online for this price) and our two teenage sons were free. Amazing considering this included 2 metro rides plus the aforementioned strudel and latte in a nice restaurant."

There is one part of the tour which involves walking up around 100 steps to Buda. For anyone less able, Anita was more than happy to provide a bus ticket so that they didn't have to walk.Excellent value tour- recommended.

Our guide was La'szlo', who proved to be very knowledgeable and a very kind and polite companion. He even played a couple of folk Hungarian songs with his flute and encouraged people to make questions on the attractions and on the history, which he answered promptly and convincingly. The Buda tour takes about 2 hours and the Pest tour another 3 hours. I suggest taking both tours if possible in 2 days. If you don't have time it is possible to take both in one day but could be somewhat exhausting, but I guess you would feel this is time well spent as La'szlo' will make it fun and enjoyable. Good Luck."

I highly recommend this tour and ask about Balazs Berenui as he is very friendly and knowledgable."

We ended up being the only people on the tour. It was cold but we still had a great time. Our guide (Brigit) was fantastic - extremely knowledgable, funny and easy to understand. The tour started at the Discover Budapest tour centre with the first stop the magnificent Opera House. From there we took the metro (tickets included in the tour price) to Heroes Square, the baths and other sights. From there the metro to St Stephens Basilica, stopping off at a local cafe for coffee and strudel (also included in tour price) before heading to the Chain Bridge. the tour ending after walking to Fishermans Bastion. This was a great tour to become familiar with Budapest. We were able to work out which places we wanted to go back to and spend more time. Brigit also helped us with other sights that would be of interest. This is a great tour - value for money, informative and a great guide."

Peter is incredibly knowledgeable about Budapest and histroy in general and was great company.The sights visited (Opera House, Metro, Heroes' Square, City Park, Liberty Square, Chain Bridge & Castle Hill) were by no means an exhaustive \"to do list\" but flowed well and gave a very good general experience of one of my now favourite cities.Would recommend this tour to everyone. Just be mindful that there's a fair bit of walking involved so maybe not for everyone, but that was the only downside I could see.Brilliant tour, Brilliant guide, Brilliant city !!!!!"

Budapest is not the exception, so when you go to Budapest you must get a walking tour to understand all the Buda and Pest cities history and why now they have merged into one. We had Peter as our tour guide. We had the Pest tour which is the one in city center around the opera, the parlament and St. Stephen's Chatedral and some other places. These 3 buildings are Peter's \"must visit\" in budapest. You can be part of this tour using the budapest card, however for the Buda side the citycard won't work with this company (there is another one). It was a 2 1/2 walk with plenty of information about the Pest side and all its history. At the end of the tour Peter gave us a small taste of an hungarian cinnamon swirl bread which was very delicious."

After our 30 minutes of practice at riding segways, we were ready to hit the city, but unfortunately there was a parade. Me and my sister were the only ones who could come the next day. I would think people who run tours in cities should know when the city is going to be completely blocked off, but oh well. They all spoke nice english, but I could never hear what the guide was saying because of traffic. She didn't exactly speak loud in my opinion either. The actual segway ride was fun, I'd liked a little more practice on how to go down and get up curbs, especially since I nearly fell off my segway at a curb. My segway also kept rearing up, which was very scary. The guide said I was probably going too fast then, but I was at the same speed with everyone... I also found it a bit offputting that my sister asked if people fell off a lot (we signed a form where they took no responsibility and we had to pay if we crashed etc) and the guide said yeah, especially the old people.I'm not sure if I would come back to do this, it was a bit expensive too, for just riding segways and not really having much guiding. But it was a different experience, and for that it was fun. My sister liked it more than I did."

Te tour route was fairly poorly chosen as it went from the Opera House to St. Steven's Basillica to the Chain Bridge before being dropped off at a mass preordered river cruise. The walking tour added no real value to the evening and the route should be rethought to include more ground and while the guide, Kinga, was pleasant, much of the information which she provided was either provided at the rehearsed level and not from the knowledge level, and then was contradicted by the evening river cruise video. My wife and I have used Viator to book over a dozen different activities in at least a half dozen different countries and this was clearly one of the most disappointing activities we have been part of. I hope that Discover Budapest rethinks the route for the walking tour, though it is difficult to cover Budapest in a walking tour."

Our friendly and very pleasant guide, Brigitte, expressed concern in accommodating our needs from the start. We underwent training in a safe area and discussed desirable touring approaches to meet our expectations prior to setting off on our excursion. During our excursion we were able to cover a lot of ground, with greater speed and efficiency than a walking tour! The boys stayed actively engaged and enjoyed the additional challenge this unconventional touring approach had to offer. With Brigitte's expertise and guidance we navigated our way through pest quite smoothly. Thanks, Brigitte- you were the best!! Great family fun and adventure that I would highly recommend.

We went to so many different sites - such a quick way to get around the city. Fanni gave us lots of information about the buildings and the history of Budapest. She was very personable and fun. The tours were either 2.5 or 3.5 hrs. We went on the longer one and were so glad that we did. Amazing experience. I would do it again in a heartbeat."

You can move over a fairly large area quicker than if you walk but without getting tired. Still you access all the walking areas so you get really close to the sights. And the Segway is so much fun to ride! Plus, since you have a guide with you, you get a very personal touch to the tour. We had chosen the 2,5 hour Grand tour, which started with a quick training session outside the office and then Mesi gave our family (2 parents, 2 teens) an excellent tour, thank you Mesi!It was so much fun, we felt we could have done this every day :) You don't need any special clothes or equipment to do this, my only tip is to put on sun tan lotion and bring a bottle of water (the Segway has a little bag in the front where you can keep it handy) if you do the tour on a hot day like we did. Young or old, on your own or with friends or family - this is the perfect way to do the Budapest tour - book it!/Annica"

Finally, our male guide showed us how to ride the Segway - and to his credit he was absolutely fantastic. Sad a bad review when he was so great. We then had to wait another hour for late comers because one of the tour guides made it clear she didn't want to take 3 people by herself. Too bad if we had something else on afterwards!! I asked to use their 'free internet' to email our friends to let them know we'd be late. Only for an extremely rude 'backpacker' with a half shaved head to roll her eyes at me, shake her hands in my face and told me to 'hurry up'... Finally we got on our way to find we COULD NOT GO ON OUR TOUR.. There was a parade and the city was blocked off.. Something a business should know!! No apology.. Just abuse from the shaved head girl. No discount for rebooking.. They were all SO RUDE.. Except our actual lovely male guide... He was so nice: the rest were rude backpackers who have no idea how to run a business and I'd be appalled if I owned the business. One backpacker was actually eating his dinner while we were all trying to sort out out refunds. Don't waste your time - go with Budapest Segway Tours.. They are amazing!!"

Booked with City Segway Tours since I had a fun time on the last Segway tour I did with them some 6 years ago. Our tour guide Mashi was cute and knowledgeable, but it took an hour from the time we arrived to get going as everyone had to be briefed on Segway use individually and even though I prepayed at their request with Paypal and confirmed payment, they insisted on refunding me and making me pay by credit card instead. Most disappointing though was the fact that they had speed limited their Segways. I agree that this is a good idea for inexperienced riders, but not nearly as fun for those that know how to ride."

This was my first time on a Segway so I was a little reluctant. The reluctance subsided quickly as the guide gave me a quick 5 minute lesson, which was enough to get me going. If you are a little adventurous and not timid (and can learn to trust the machine), after 20 minutes the Segway practically responds to your thoughts. The territory we covered included very crowded squares, uneven terrain, dirt paths, grassy fields, areas of high traffic, steep hills, and I felt very comfortable during the journey.As for the tour, I have nothing but great things to say about it. I was lucky to have been the only one so it was just myself and the tour guide. As a result, the guide pretty much customized the tour for me. It was supposed to be the Citadel Tour, but we were able to cover much territory in the 2 hours I signed on for (Budapest Castle, Parliament, residential neighborhoods, etc...). The Citadel portion was particularly fun because the tour guide took me off the path and to places that you could not cover any other way. We went to places busses could not get to, hills that only very physically fit bike riders could manipulate, and covered more territory in two hours than you could walk in 2 days. To my liking, the tour guide took me through residential neighborhoods and places where you would never see tourists and only find the locals.My guide, Balazs was really good. Not only did he customize the tour for me, but was very knowledgable and provided a good narrative along the way.I can't say enough about this experience. True, it is a bit more costly - but the experience is well worth it. My only regret is that I was traveling on business so I did not have my wife and 3 kids to share the adventure with."

He was attentive, considerate, amusing, and an all round nice guy. However the Segway really steals the show. It was fantastic fun.

We were told to arrive 15mins early before the tour started which we did but unfortuantly the owner didn't show up until 15mins after the start time, standing around for 30mins in the street not fun. But he did apologise and all was forgiven. We had a good sized group and half had already used a segway before, but for safety its reasonable that everyone tries it out and feels comfortable, but because there was 8 or so of us this took 45mins! Oh my gosh this was frustrating, I think segway tours should say beginners should come 20mins earlier than tour start time, do their training, so we can all get going on time and start seeing the city. Our superior tour just ended up being the basic tour and once back at base, back on the segway and up to Hereos square and back. For the tour itself it was a tour of Budapest's big buildings and squares. No real insights or special places and didn't really take advantage of the segway, I imagine those sights are the same as you would do on the big red bus. We didn't go to the castle side, I would have liked to see if our segway could save a climb up the hill (in Athens we segwayed the steep hill up to the Acropolis with everyone else walking in the sun it was a fantastic use of the vehicle!). With the superior tour do have a hearty breakfast before hand, it was coolish and there was no pee or snack stops. Actually a quick way to add something would have been a stop in one of the famed coffee houses, maybe try a unique product like a Cserpes Trudi, slice of langos at a street stall, lace being made, the Tisza story outside the store. I'm only going by other tours we had in other cities who all added something different, not just a bus tour on a segway. I love Segway tours and I would still recomend this to segway beginners, basic tourists and people who love big building facades and squares. But if you've done segway before or want tours with a bit of extra insight I think you would be dissapointed."

Really informative tour but not too much deep-rooted history to tie us up which was kind especially after a night on the Hungarian liquor. Considering Budapest is delightfully cheap for us Brits, it is well worth splashing out a little extra cash on doing one of these Segway tours.

The difference between ocean cruises and a river cruise can be sum up in one word personal. Because your cruisemates will number anywhere from 100 to 185 people who become individuals very quickly. If you like meeting people this is a vacation for you. In addition the food quality and selection beats most oceanliners and you are going nonstop from a wonderful buffet breakfast and lunch to a seatdown dinner with wine included. No need to worry about coffee be it expresso or capacino as it is available free 24 hours. We sailed on Avalon's older ship the Tapestry, 2006, and one would never notice any aging with staterooms larger then again most oceanliners. Can't say enough very enjoyable, great new friends."

On our first morning we went on a City Segway tour and cannot recommend it highly enough! Office is conveniently located behind the opera house and you get a 30 minute tutorial and practice before heading off on the tour. Agnes was our guide and she was lovely - fun and informative. For 2 1/2 hours we glided around the city seeing key places - it really helped us orientate ourselves. The Segways are brilliant - a bit wobbly at first and then before many minutes and before you realise it, \"Segwaying\" is as natural as walking - but oh so much more fun! You become a tourist attraction as you glide around, which is a first for me! We loved it and all 4 of us on the tour want one! Do this tour - you will love it!"

You do cross some fairly busy roads and have to navigate around numerous pedestrians, so it might not be suitable for those that are either very timid or completely Gung-ho. It might seem quite expensive, but it's worth every penny. I loved every minute of it and I'd definitely recommend it."

After a short instruction, a short test drive and the a few 100 meters of the tour all in our party were very confident driving this strange vehicle.And it was great fun and a very cool way to experience the city. And a very nice and knowledgeable guide was leading the way. This is a must try for all.Also the service we got from the office was world class."

Discover Budapestwww.DiscoverBudapest.comTry this site for this company's other tours that take you out into the country and to visit three towns on the Danube. We had a tour guide Edina and she was fabulous. Definitely ask for her. She was informative, fun, and provided a very personal tour and experience for us. It was an all day tour on a small bus making many stops - and then a boat ride down the Danube back to Budapest. My teenage son enjoyed this too. Edina took us to a perfect Hungarian restaurant and helped us order true authentic dishes. It was our best meal. WONDERFUL TOUR. THey also provide walking tours in Budapest through Absolute Walking Tours. We did this too and also enjoyed very much."

The reservation over the internet worked without a hitch, and we actually got a refund without asking since the Forint dropped quite a bit lately. Customer service like that is not a common thing in Hungary.The weather was very cold and somewhat wet. Just make sure you dress for it as you will be basically standing for two hours.Our tourguide Andrew taught us the basics and within 15-20 minutes we were scooting around like pros.The tour took us through some cool sites and travelling was straightforward on the segways. The guide was excellent and we learned a lot of interesting history. He was also very personable and his English together with his communication skills were excellent (another rarity in this corner of the world).I would highly recommend the segway tour no matter your age. We covered a lot ground safely and speedily giving us more time to actually see the sites."

I thought a Segway tour would be something a little fun and also give us some sense of the city layout on our first day.Couldn't have been more right!We arrived at the shop behind the Opera 10 minutes early - only to find the shop closed. Cue panic from me \"But it says get here early!\" I guess in cold February they aren't that busy and didn't need the extra time. The shop opened at 10 and in we went for a 20 minute lesson with our guide Bea. I was worried at first that I would not manage it - it being standing on a platform and leaning backwards and forwards. After a bit I got it but still felt nervous \u2013 Bea assured us we would soon feel it was natural and be trying to go faster. Still, after practicing going over a bump to ready us for pavements we were off outside.Luckily we had thought about the weather and had thick gloves and coats as it was pretty cold standing on the Segway. The thrill of it soon warmed us up though! We zoomed all round with Bea giving us a really good tour and information \u2013 and despite the cold kept going for the full two hours!! And she was right \u2013 we did get the hang of it and did want to go faster!This isn\u2019t an in-depth city tour but for getting your bearings and having fun it was excellent.We will definitely do a City Segway tour again (unless I can persuade my husband to let me buy one!)Luckily we had thought about the"

But I wanted to give my husband a special birthday gift and payed him (and me) for segwaying in the city. After a 20min orientation (we learned how to use the segway) we started to see the city center: along Andrassy street thorough Erzs\u00e9bet and De\u00e1k squares to the Danube. We've seen than the Chain Bridge, Parliament and Basilica too. The tour took us 2 hours but the most fun was to be on the segway. Lot of tourists and local people asked us how did we get this vehicle and what is it called, how is it work. A guide came with us who answered to all these questions. And she told us stories about the different buildings too - that we didn't know before, though we both live in Budapest :)I think it's fun to see the city on a segway and I would recommend it to everybody. It is easy to learn and easy to use - you only have to stand and sometimes make a curve :)"

It was very appealing, but we didn't know exactly what to expect -- would it be dangerous or difficult or just fun. It turned out to be a fun time. We took the 2 hour tour on the Pest side near the Opera and Parliament. They took between 20 minutes and a half hour to orient us to the Segways and then off we went. I would definitely recommend this tour. It is fun to do and more personal than a bus tour. We are both in our 60's and had no difficulty managing the Segways. Be careful of the posts on the eges of the sidewalk where you cross the streets. I fell off, but with no injury (except to my pride). A really different and fun activity!"

My girlfriend and I did just that on our trip to Budapest recently and what an experience! A Segway looks like a two wheel lawn mower. A battery powered two wheeled scooter that goes about 9mph max. The segway tour office is on Lazar Utca immediately behind theOpera House. You start with a 15 minute induction of the machine. A really nice guide we had in Anna. Once we got the hang of the machine off we went speeding along towards the Danube, getting so much attention from passsers by as we went. The trip lasts two hours and you get to see a part of the City you would not normally experience. People smile as you glide past and boy do people watch you.The tour takes you through the streets of Pest from The Opera House through to the river, the chain bridge and then on to the Parliament building.Absolutely recommended!!"
