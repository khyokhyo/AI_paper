Not so crowded as prague castle, so this offers a great break. The graveyard at the top is also interesting, a lot of great people from prague rests there."

It's a fortified hill with small museum, church, and a cemetery where famous Czechs were buried. A pilgrimage for Alphonse Mucha would not be complete without a visit to Vysehrad. The tombstones were amazing (and some were even funny). The entrance to the park is free, but you need to pay for the museum/exhibition. Do not miss the beautiful view of the city and the river from up the fortress!"

This was the perfect time to do so as we were mostly alone to walk the medieval walls and ruins, taking in the ridiculous views of downtown Prague and the river. Walking through the Slavin cemetery is a must for anyone interested in Czech history. By 11:00 the tour groups began filling the area. Still, the views, history, greenery are well worth a visit any time--just a short walk from Hotel Union Prague."

Although there were a few tour groups, the area is so large that we mainly just saw locals walking their dogs or strolling with children. There are multiple points of interest from various periods in Prague's history and beautiful views of the city. It is located a few subway stops out of the Old Town, near the convention center, but is worth the distance to spend some relaxed time outdoors."

Was disappointed with the place, not grand , nor unique. Just normal. The most impressive is the Bascillica Minor, dedicated to St Paul and St. Peter but you have to pay to visit the inside. Many came to visit the cemetery , possibly paying respect to relatives or just to have a look. From here you can proceed to see Rotunda of St. martin. Then visit the garden."

It is said that when Libu\u0161e, the legendary ancestor of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty and the Czech people as a whole, stood on the Vy\u0161herad escarpment, she predicted that Prague would become a great city.There the ancient Czech built an impregnable battlement as their first defense to the city. Later, the castle was changed to where it is now, but the old area has endured, now as a beautiful, quiet park and the site of the St. Peter and St. Paul Basilica.The grounds are perfect for an afternoon picnic, there are some great views up and down the Vltava river, and you forget that there is a vibrant, sometimes frenetic city only a few kilometers away.The jewel of the area is the church, reminiscent of St. Vitus Cathedral on the outside with its Gothic architecture, its double spires and black stone. The interior, however is quite different. The altar piece presents a gilded frame of sculpted Peter and Paul, surrounded by Czech saints. The rest of the church is painted in the Alfons Mucha's Art Nouveau style. The green, floral motifs on the ceiling and the interior of the arches make you feel like you're in a forest. Saints from the Czech repertoire adorn three sides of each column.Going there is like dipping into a vat of serenity that recharges you for the rest of your Prague visit.Well-worth it and kid-friendly, but also a very romantic spot. The grounds are free; the church has an entry fee.Take metro line C to Vy\u0161ehrad stop, get out on the Prague Congress side and follow the signs."

If you want to spend a day relaxing and wanted to relax, this could be your place. The Church was also spectacular inside and is 50kr or 30 for students.

I jogged up a side street, asked a helpful guard for directions and continued up the hill (walking a bit too). Got to the top and there are various buildings around but I couldn't see the spires. Asked a local who pointed me towards the church. Jogged around the church and up to the edge of the walls where you get great views up and down the river. I didn't spend too long exploring the top but found some stairs the whole way down back to the road."

Perched over the Vltava river this old fortification allows great views looking back on Prague. In addition, it has some great cultural gems, many famous Czech poets, artisans, and musicians are buried in the cemetery and the Basilica of St. Peter and Paul is really stunning. There's a nice park to relax in for a few hours and grab drink or bite to eat. It's a fair walk from the downtown tourist center of Prague, but if you take the walk along the river its really quite relaxing. Definitely recommended for this who are interested in Czech history or for this who want to see something a little off the main tourist path."

After ending a morning walk at the Letna Hill, we descended the steps down to the Cechuv Most and in a perfect timing boarded the No. 17 tram, that just arrived. The 'scenic ride' by the river brought us to the foot of Vysehrad. We did not want to use the Metro, as I much prefer to travel above ground.So far so good. It was one of the hottest days we experienced in Prague - ever! ...and we chose it to climb the many stairs from the bottom all the way up. Of course we should have known better. But we did the climb many times before since childhood (oh, how easy it was then). What a test of endurance! Reaching the top, before attempting anything else we rewarded ourself with a large beer each in a nearby restaurant. Cold and smooth beer, just what you want and need on a hot sunny day in Prague. With our resolve strengthened we proceeded to stroll the lovely grounds, rewarded by the tranquility and beauty at every turn. Grateful, that the segways and the selfie sticks and the large hordes of people with them did not choose to visit the same time we did. The cemetery was so serene, the few people who were walking around did so respectfully and quietly. Such beauty at every turn.The history is vast here, parts of it I remember from my history class years ago, some is easily refreshed by looking on internet. Vysehrad and the structures around it - from the 10th century on - have undergone vast changes. The original ramparts remain ... In the evening, as the sun sets and reflects in the river, the city becomes golden and heart- achingly beautiful. One of my favorite places in the world at any time and in every season...Make time to visit...You'll be glad you did !"

This monument is the old castle of the ancient kings of Prague. Whilst the castle itself has gone there is a beautiful church there (entry 30 Koruna) set in lovely gardens with fantastic views over Prague and along the river Vltava. The cemetery is also quite interesting as it is full of University Professors, famous musicians and international footballers.

It's absolutely gorgeous in it's own right (there are beautiful gardens, lots of cool statuary in the church cemetery, and the church itself is gorgeous), but it's also worth it if you're looking for great views of Prague Castle from a unique angle. Additional bonus for classical music lovers: this is where Dvo\u0159\u00e1k is buried! He has a pretty cool monument in the church cemetery (which is also the Czech national cemetery if I recall correctly). Bottom line: It's a bit of a trek to get out here from the city center but it's 100% worth it for the great views and cool statuary."

The direction from the metro station to here is pretty clear and straight forward with the sign post \"Vysehrad\" everywhere. You can get a map (czk20) from the information counter not far from the main gate (The Tabor Gate) which helps a bit to navigate in this beautiful park.The Church of SS Petr and Paul is very prominent from everywhere and you should not miss it (you need to pay to get in). The Vysehrad Cemetary beside the church is worth a visit especially the Pantheon which is the resting place for many prominent figures in the history of Czech Republic. My favourite place in the walkway near the brick wall nearby which allow the visitors to have a panoramic view of Prague city including the iconic landmark such as Prague Castle and few bridges with the Vltava river flowing around."

We were hoping to see a \"castle\", which we found out isn't there. Our Lonely Planet guidebook had a map of the park, and with it we were able to have an idea where we were going on the grounds. There was a cemetery, which has a variety of old and new tombstones, but we didn't recognize any of the names. There was a cathedral there, which was about to close, so we looked inside briefly and it didn't seem any different than most other traditional cathedrals. On the west side of the park there were good views of the Vlatva River, both north toward the Prague Castle as well as south. The park itself wasn't busy, which was a nice break from the more popular Old Town and Castle Districts. If you have extra time to spend in Prague, this could be a nice place to go and have a picnic, otherwise I would suggest skipping it. We opted to take the Metro, but in reading other reviews it looks as though one could also get here by a riverside path."

The Vysehrad area is underrated, probably because it appears understated, does not cater much for touristic and is a bit from the old city center although it is easy to get to by multiple tram lines. The area has so much to offer. The Vysehrad castle is an excellent place for a picnic, it holds the Slavin cemetery with the well-ordered graves of the dignified Czechs (as opposed to the old Jewish cemetery), the Peter and Paul church which is amazingly decorated on the inside, beautiful and far from most great churches in it's mix of modern art nouveau and ancient medieval lime paintings-style, and in the weekends you are likely to find an event or activity of some kind in the park. Add to that the great sunset view of the Vlata river and the west bank (see it from the viewpoint at the art gallery). When you're done with the castle the nearby area is packed with the real Prague. Go to the lost city below the Nusle Bridge and be amazed with the view and the oddity of it all. Or to the streets at the foothill of the Vysehrad castle and get good Czech food in U Kroka, cake and coffee in one of the several small places or beer at the dock side in the summertime. And see several fine examples of the unique cubist architecture in Prague, e.g. Kovarivic House, Triplex House and the tenement house in Neklanova street."

City walls that seem not to conquer.In the middle a church that offers for a small free a nice break from walking, alternatively also the option of having a snack and a beef in the small restaurant is available.All in all , put around two hours aside to see this part of Prague ...

It seems that many tourists don't find their way here, which is a refreshing change to the mad bustle of much of the town centre. It's an easy walk from the Metro station. The graveyard is astonishing and even without recognising the Czech great and good interred here, the sculpture and art of their resting places is easily appreciated. And talking of art, pay a small fee and go inside the Church of St Peter and St Paul. It was fully painted by two Czech artists, in the style of Mucha - so if you appreciate Art Nouveau, you'll adore the decoration, from the wistful saints to the flowers and trees that twine round ceilings, pillars and walls. A truly unique church, I'd suggest and not nearly as well-known as it deserves."

Huge statues and the imposing cathedral are inside as well as the cemetery that is clearly listed with several famous people. The gallery was shut for what seemed to be a very long \"break\" so didn't et the chance to see it. The crypt was disappointing but very cheap. I finally found the Brick Gate which now houses the original statues from the King Charles Bridge. You have to go on tour down there and it's freezing!! Also no English, only Czech and fairly miserable staff sadly, but worth it. Takes all of 15 mins but several hours for the whole castle and gardens. A picnic is a Gd idea subject to weather. Great views of Prague. Recommended"

Going under the walls of Vysehrad to find the chamber in which thry have stored the original statues from Charles Bridge is a very unique experience. Giving you the feeling of being a soldier from long ago. The complex itself is very large with many green spaces and monuments, not to forget the magnificent views of the surrounding areas. The St.Cryil and Methodious church is located here complete with a cemetery of some of the most important figures to the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Highly recommened."

The first records we can find in the beginning of 11th century and this place was very improtant fortress in that time, even Charles IV. included Vyshehrad in the plan to make Prague a center of the Roman Empire. Visitors can see beautiful gardens with nice flower and trees, many statues and sculptures - e.g. Libushe and Premysl, Ctirad and Sharka, Zaboj and Slavoj etc. These are the persons from old Czech history. It could be maybe interesting for tourists to know that Libushe had prophetic abilities and predicted many things, incl. the place where Prague will be built, the importance and respect of the Prague Castle etc. After the ascent to the walls of Vyshehrad you reveal spectacular views of the Vltava River, Charles Bridge, Prague Castle, Petrin Tower and other nice parts of Prague City. During your walk you can see Cathedral of Peter and Paul, Tabor Gate, Leopold Gate, Slavin - giant joint tomb of prominent Czech personalities, Vyshehrad cemetery etc. And finally - they say that Vyshehrad has very strong positive energy potential, so you can feel really relaxed after visiting this place."

Instead of climbing up from the river I came from the \"inland\" entrance, from the metro station, and since the area is so big and so varied there is always new things to view. This time I first stopped at the St.Martins rotunda, one of the very oldest churches in Prague, and then walked up next to the Chapter house towards the cemetary (which I hadn't seen before). And what a sight is was, with masses of huge and very impressive graves of the more celebrated citizens of Bohemia over the last century. Especially gorgeous was the artwork surrounding many of the graves under the arched peristyle, rich mosaics, amazing statuary etc. Then I went in to see the St. Peter and Paul cathedral, and again I was very surprised, because the entire church is painted in murals in the very colourful and rich Art Noveau style, which enhances the New Gothic feeling to great heights. After this I walked around the grounds to take in the view from the bailiworks down to the river and town below, when I stumbled upen the Gothic cellar, where there is a much worthwhile exhibition of the history of the place. Very interesting indeed. After this, and further exploration of the grounds I left by the \"river\" entrance, very satisfied. I will be back, and no doubt there will be things there that I haven't seen before also then."

It's much more secluded than the touristy Prague Castle, but I ended up liking it much better. The church is stunning and a must-visit...and just exploring the grounds -- little trails and doorways, the views.. Stunning!"

The views from the ramparts are great, and the interior of the church is amazing - the art nouveau style hand painted panels and ceiling are very different from the other frequently visited churches in Prague. There is a very small admission charge for entry to the church. We always make sure we are there at midday to hear the bells ringing - they must continue for about 15 minutes. The cemetery is the resting place of many famous or important czechs, with some beautiful headstones and sculptures. Unlike many of the main Prague attractions, this area is peaceful and tranquil - a good place to escape for a bit from the hustle and bustle of the castle area, Charles Bridge or old town square"

It about a ten minute walk from the closest metro station, once you've gone through the archway on the right is a tourist information places with a lovely little cafe in it too. The grounds are big with plenty to see and do, I did pay 50k\u010d to look at the history museum which is very good value for money! This is the only thing I had to pay for while I was there. There are beautiful views of Prague form several places around the perimeter walls so don't forget your camera!! It was beautiful in the winter and I bet in the summer it's outstanding!!! :)"

There used to be a castle, which some of the Czech sovereigns prefered to Prague Castle. It was an important centre of the church, later it became a fortress, the walls of which are still kept. In 19th century a famous cemetery was founded where the most of the Czech famous writers, artists and even sportsmen are burried. Today it serves as a recreational walking area of mainly local people. It is a beautiful large park where while walking along the fortress walls you can admir beautiful views, visit Saint Peter and Paiul \u00b4 s church with art nouveau interior, see one of the oldest churches in the country-Rotunda of Saint Martin. There are also couple of restaurants and fast foods, so you can easily spendthere a half day on your leasure."

We didn't take the usual route up but walked around the back to find a narrow passage leading up between the houses. This was much nicer as the other side was full of tourists. Arriving to the top the view was breathtaking. Either we were lucky or Sunday is not a popular day for Vysehrad, it was very peaceful and quiet. It only started getting busy when we were leaving around 1pm. Walk around the church, check out the ruins, admire the cemetery and just soak in the view."

Having caught the tram we walked up the hill. The views are amazing from the walls of the fort. You can walk round 360 degrees. From one side you have views over Prague and the Vltava River and on other sides over the suburbs and outlying areas of Prague. In the moat there are now tennis courts and an outdoor concert area in one corner. There are plenty of grassy areas and small roads to stroll about. As it was such a cold day we took shelter in a small cafe/bar where we had coffee and delicious chestnut cake. We also walked to the church in the middle of the area. Behind its decorated doors are lots of frescoes and paintings in the small chapels on either side of the main part of the church. As it was the Christmas season there were several Christmas trees and a large nativity scene with lifesize figures. There was a small charge to enter the church. Beside the church is the National Cemetery where many famous Czech citizens including Smetana are buried. This beautiful cemetery with its snow covered graves, many decorated for Christmas, was a perfect place to visit. Vysehrad is a quiet place to visit, where, in summer, you can see the locals enjoying picnics, walking, running and playing games. Just past the side entrance on the right is a wonderful souvenir shop where the gifts are made by disabled people. Really good and authentic souvenirs."

Found this place and it has really good reviews so decided to check it since i've got the whole day to kill before i head back to London. This place didn't disappoint me. I took the tram to Vyton and then walk up the steps. It was sunny but windy and freezing cold but walking did a lot of good to keep myself warm. It was a massive place and the parkland has amasing view. There were loads of benches to sit on if you get tired walking. The highlight were the National Cemetery with incredible graves which must have cost millions of CZK and St.Paul and Peter Cathedral. The cemetery was more like a gallery of statues and monument. It was kept well. You have to pay 50CZK which was really cheap to get in to the cathedral. There was also a leaflet which was really handy so you wud have an idea of cathedral. As usual it was amasing inside. I took so much time here especially walking around park though it was cold because the scenic view was inviting. Did this walk on Saturday where weekend market was on so decided to walk to the market at Vyton on my way back to old town square. Loads of food, wine, products and etc. It was an amasing day to end my trip in Praha."

You can still walk a circuit around most of the ramparts, and there are some interesting sights in there, including a beautiful Gothic church, a cupola or chapel that looks Byzantine and is said to be the oldest standing building in Prague, and the graves of Smetana and Dvorak in the cemetery.

            "review": "Time Limited? 5 Good Stops at Vysehrad. You could spend hours exploring Vysehrad, but if your time is limited, here are 5 interesting stops you can make to give a short visit some punch.1. Panoramic View. Take Prague Metro Line C to Vysehrad. As you exit for the short walk to the fortress, look to your right for a stunning panorama of Prague's domes and steeples, the Vltava River and Hradcany beyond.2. Photo Stop at Leopold Gate. You'll enter the inner fortress through this 17th century Baroque style gate near the old moat. Quick pic here makes a charming frame and shows you've arrived. With more time, you can explore the casemates (the network of passages through the fortress ramparts) through an entrance to the left of the gate. Ticket costs 30 CZK or Prague card gets you in for free.3. Rotunda of St. Martin. 11th century Romanesque chapel that is the earliest surviving structure of Prague's ancient citadel. Walk around it to feel the history: looted in 1420, burned in 1523, damaged by Prussian bombardment in 1757, it's seen it all. The south facing portal magnificently modified by architect Antonin Baum in 1878 when the chapel was reconsecrated is a great photo spot and the symbolic frame for a moment in history at Vysehrad. 4. Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul. Founded in the 12th century, but reconstructed 1885 to 1903 in Neo-Gothic style with eye-popping art nouveau interior decoration and one of the most colorful doorway entries one could imagine in a house of worship. This is a place to linger, gawk, and photograph. See my pictures to get an idea of the beauty, including frescoes strongly resembling works by Alphonse Mucha and not to be missed if you admire that artist (who inspired the actual artists, Frantisek Urban and Marie Urbanov\u00e1-Zahradnicka.)To understand what you're seeing, you can borrow an English-language information sheet at the entrance to read along as you walk through. There's also an inexpensive 32-page booklet with good color photos and an English-language insert that gives quite extensive details of the seven different reconstructions that transformed it from 12th century Romanesque to early 20th century Neo-Gothic. Makes a nice souvenir of your visit and gives you something to read later on at your leisure.5. Cemetery. For a Vysehrad death trip, you'll find a gallery of notables buried in the cemetery next to the basilica, many of them in the beautiful art nouveau Slavin tomb, conceived as a pantheon for national luminaries in art, literature and science. Alphonse Mucha is there, very appropriately considering his artistic influence on the turn-of-the-century basilica renovation. You'll also find the world-famous Czech composer Antonin Dvorak (New World Symphony, Slavonic Dances) and science fiction writer Karel Capek (his play R.U.R. coined the word \"robot\" and gave sci-fi its first example of an artificial but human-like entity). If the grim reaper isn't your thing, you can just snap a photo of the lovely angel sculpture atop the Slavin tomb and go away happy.There is plenty more to see if you decide to stay longer, which you may want to do on a beautiful fall day. In contrast to Hradcany, Vysehrad is tranquil and uncrowded. There are cafes where you can linger and nice spots (including a playground for the kids) where you can pass some pleasant moments with nature and history. This is the ancient citadel where Prague was born, and thus widely regarded as the heart and soul of the city. Whether you spend an hour or a day, you should visit here."

It\u2019s a bit out of the city center and it seems to be a residential area, so not much to see around it. We saw two restaurants on the grounds: one seemed to be expensive and the other was cheap, had limited options and didn\u2019t look very inviting, if you ask me. There was a lot of ground to cover, but we didn\u2019t feel like exploring more than we did, since it was a very hot day in July. Actually, it is quite a walk just to get to the place itself from the tram stop. We had five full days in Prague, so it wasn\u2019t a huge waste of time going there, but if your time is limited, you should skip it.

The first time I visited Vyseherad was back in the fall of 1990, only a short time after the Velvet revolution, and it was then as now pretty bare. Bare but non the less impressive, because what you don't see you can surely imagine, and there are enough remains there for you to construct what's missing on top of them and perceive the full glory. Then there is the setting, high upon a hill right up from the river, it is easy to see why it was an obvious choice for the earliest (?) fortifications in Prague. Bring a picnic basket, and enjoy the splendid views and the strong feel of history that permeats this place. I have been back many times since that first visit 25 years ago, and never seem to tire of it."

But its impressive history, rich culture, stunning beauty and mesmerising texture shines through all the layers of cultural commercialism. And nowhere this irrepressible character can be seen so prominently than in the enchanting grounds of Vysehrad where the Church of St Peter and Paul towers over the River Vltava and staring down the Prague castle at the opposite end of the city. The Church was reported built in 10 century, but like many historical building it has had its share of difficulties and has been rebuilt a few times. The current interior was designed and finished in the style of art nouveau the 19 century. The Vysehrad cemetery is simply a work of art, with elaborate headstones marking the final resting places of many prominent Czech artists among them Bed\u0159ich Smetana, Anton\u00edn Leopold Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and alphonse mucha.

There are numerous things to see within Vysehrad too, including the impressive church, and several places to eat. I must admit that I didn't stay long enough to fully appreciate all this, but I imagine you could easily spend half a day here.I find it surprising that many people get put off visiting by the supposedly remote location but I definitely found this not to be the case. It is only a five minute walk from the metro station.My lasting memory of this place is taking in the fantastic views on all sides.

I went down to the cellar which is super old and historic. The park is nice to wander around in.

The entire fortress area is really beautiful and offers unbeatable views of the city. I picked up a magnet in one of the small shops - and it was by far the cheapest souvenir (and the nicest) that I bought during my entire trip. Walk around the outer edge for fantastic photo opportunities and a very peaceful setting away from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are plenty of places to sit and relax on benches on in the grass, and many people were having picnics. The basilica there is stunning (although I didn't go inside - there was a wedding) and the cemetery beside it was also beautiful, with very unique headstones and decor and a lot of famous Czech persons buried there - there's a map near the entrance to show you who is buried where and the tombstones are numbered as well. I also went into the small museum that offers a history of the fortress, and I'd definitely recommend going in (for a small fee) so that you can understand the history of where you are. Overall, highly, highly recommend visiting Vysehrad while you're in Prague - definitely the most peaceful and beautiful place to go (IMO)."

            "review": "Absoutely my favorite place in Prague. I lived in Prague as an expat for two years and of all the wonderful sights and experiences, and there are many, my personal favorite is the Vysehrad. The Vysehrad is an area on top of a promontory overlooking the Vltava River. It contains a large park, the Prague minor Cathedral, a museum that contains the original statues from Charles Bridge and the Hirbitrov, which is the national cemetery used for important Czechs. The views are lovely, there is plenty of green space and places to have a pivo (beer) and some nibbles and enjoy a spot seldom visited by foreigners. In high tourist season that is especially appealing. The Cathedral, which was restored in the very early 20th century, has small but interesting religious exhibits and the wall paintings, done in the Art Nouveau style are beautiful. Pay the small entrance fee (sometimes it is free) and wander around this lovely building and sit and soak up the beauty and the peace. It is worth the fee. Finally, take the time to really visit the cemetery. It is so much more than just a burial ground. The personalities of the families, because most are family crypts, are shown in the decoration of the crypt sites or the markers in the central area. The full spectrum of possibility is there from religious to wonderfully strange. I think many people just walk straight through and don't take the time to go up and down the aisles and really look at the markers, and that is a pity. Also, famous Czechs like the composers Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Bed\u0159ich Smetana are entombed here as well as the famous Czech artist Alfons Mucha. It is a magical place and not morbid at all."

You can wander around the grounds for at least an hour, spend time in the beautiful cemetery, an art piece all by itself, and then finish your visit sitting in the cathedral awestruck by the intricate Art Noveau walls and ceilings and arches, as the organ induces a spiritual moment.

A national historic site, many important Czechs are buried on the grounds in elaborate crypts and with ornate tombs. Yet another reason to visit as they're unlike any I've seen in the world.

It contains so many viewing points that you can see and take great pictures of different areas of Prague. It has great sight lines just about everywhere.

The cathedral was truly awe inspiring with it's architecure and truly great condition for it's age. I hate to say it, but if you see one castle in Prague, see this one over the more famous cousin.

It's only 10 minutes by tram or Metro from the centre. When you get off the tram there are no directions but it's obvious how to get to the castle area - up! At the entrance to the site there is an information office where you can pick up a useful map (20 czk). It is free to walk around though there are some museums which you pay for (we chose not to as it was a lovely sunny day). A lovely historic location, plenty of interest including a Basilica and cemetery - the latter with some incredibly ornate mausolea of the Prague elite of a century ago. Add great views and places to eat and drink in the sun and you have a great day out. We were among very few tourists there, most people were locals especially families with young children"

There is a wonderful contrast between the old and the new here.There is a tram stop at Vysehrad and a short walk will take you to the fort. On your return use the Metro from Vysehrad to P. Pavlova (one stop) and get the 22 tram to Bila Hora to exit for Prague Castle.The fort is impressive in size and fortifications and gives a spectacular view of the city of Prague from a side you may not have seen. It is easy to understand why this site was originally selected. You will get a real feel for early Prague here. The interpretive centre is a must to visit to truly appreciate the site.There is a pleasant coffee shop serves excellent coffee but if you require something more substantial then try Rio\u2019s restaurant above the coffee shop for a real surprise which will certainly add to the experience."

The cemetery were many famous Czechs are buried was really interesting-Dvorak and Smetena are buried there. Amazing tombstones incorporating sculpture and art. The Minor Basilica was a treat-art nouveau style which was a welcome relief after so much baroque on our trip. The views from the ramparts were stunning. Great place to hang out and relax."

For my wife who had been in Czechoslovakia under the communist regime and had had a Czech boyfriend it was a particularly powerful place to be. Very different views over the Vltava. A friendly caf\u00e9. And a spectacular art nouveau interior to the Church. If trolling round palaces and museums is not your only thing, do try this lovely site"

Everyone we met was nice and helpful, and after a couple of wrong turns, we made it to the gate. This is an amazing place with beautiful grounds and buildings, great history and interesting sites - including the church and cemetary where we spent a lot of time. We can't recommend this place highly enough. It's close to the city, but appears to be miles away once your are inside the comples. All together, a great day."

It is more of a park on a raised site south of the historical city centre overlooking the Vltava river and with great views of Prague castle (although a bit far). The quality really is that it is a fairly quiet area (although it can be crowded with people when the weather is nice or when there is some activity going on) where people just hang out to relax. The graveyard holds many famous Czech people and is well kept in an Art-Deco style. You can walk over the walls surrounding the area and have many views over Prague that you cannot get otherwise. There are a few places where you can sit and get a drink or some food, but for the most it is really a park. For children there is a large playground and plenty of opportunity to run around."

I loved the city even more after my second trip because I was not confined to the old town and got to see more of the \"real Prague\". Vysehrad was probably the main highlight of my excursion. The Views over the vltava rival that of any of the most touristy spots, and it is large enough to walk around and explore. Also its much more interesting and less crowded than the Prague Castle complex. the place isn't completely isolated, but there are many just a handful of locals there and sometimes a tour group will go through the cemetary. definitely a breath of fresh air if mass tourism drives you crazy."

The castle itself was actually lovely, with some very nice views and gardens. Autumn was a great time to go, with all the golden leaves covering the area. A beautiful cemetery lies inside alongside a basilica. The hilltop location actually makes this a worthwhile visit. I would definitely take the bus or metro next time.

Many famous and prominent czech people are buried there, among them Dvorak, Smetana and Mucha. Also other famous composers and writers whose names will be recognized by the younger generation.The church is worth visiting, but there is a fee and hours may change in the fall. Refreshments and restrooms were available.If you really have a lot of time you can reach it by walking on the riverbank, perhaps starting at the National theater and then climb the steep steps uphill - mostly for the young and fit:)The views are amazing at any time, but sunset was my favorite time to visit.

It was a natural selection for a short walk before dinner to take in the sights of Prague and to introduce ourselves to the Czech Republic. Its may have been the late afternoon light but the place was something of a scenic wonder that wasn't short on history!Pros: Uncrowded (hardly anyone around actually), great grounds, wonderful views of the Vltava River, some very attractive historic buildings (along with the Czech equivalent of the Cimeti\u00e8re du P\u00e8re Lachaise in Paris), a couple of nice (albeit expensive) restaurants and great views over town as dusk settles. Cons: The Cemetery closes a little too early (19:00) particularly in summer and a cheaper restaurant or two might be worthwhile!!For my wife and I Vysehrad was a wonderful introduction to Prague!!"

It is on the opposite side of town from the castle, but positioned right on the river. It was obviously a protection fort/compound from anyone coming up the river to attack Prague. The compound walls and battle stations are preserved well so you can really go back in time. One of the most interesting things on the compound is the cemetary. This particular cemetary was used to bury some of the most prominent people in Czech history and it truly shows in the extravigance of thier burial plots. If you have not experienced old European cemetaries, this is certainly a must-see!"

We also enjoyed the superb scenic vistas and the cemetery where the classical composers Antonin Dvorak, Bedrich Smetana, and Joseph Suk are buried. We found so many kinds of statues (from small busts to monoliths) and odd-shaped decorative headstones (from stone toadstools to towering marble slabs).At St. Peter and St. Paul\u2019s sanctuary, there is none of the baroque bravado and arrogance of Prague's St. Vitus. Nor is there the grandiosity of the superabundant treasury at St. Loreto. The few treasures at St. Peter and St. Paul\u2019s while not ostentatious are elegant. In fact, everything at this church in Vysehrad is tastefully done: the pastel Art Noveau paintings of saints on all of the pillars, muted frescoes of New Testament scenes on the upper levels of the nave, the intricately folded cloth wrapped around the thighs of Jesus and the undulating folds of Mary\u2019s robe as she encompasses Jesus on her lap in the marble Pieta, and in another Pieta, this one wooden, the unusual portraying of Mary covering her face with both of her hands in quiet anguish. Even the obligatory baby angels are unobtrusive and miraculously attractive. The silver-plated altarpiece primarily devoted to St. Peter and St Paul, with the Crucifixion placed above high above them, while relatively ornate, is not gaudy.Perhaps it was the time of day and the intermittent cloud cover, but there was a breathtaking contrast between the ten intensely colored stain-glass windows and the subdued colors of everything else in the sanctuary. Each one of the thirteen-paneled spotlighted windows (three of them behind the altarpiece) gleamingly displays a different Gospel scene that is so realistically drawn that you think that you are a part of the drama. Right above every one of these depictions is a sharply detailed picture of the church\u2019s spire. The top and bottom sections of each window consist of various arabesques that look like the coruscating fragments of a kaleidoscope. What a sight! What a marvelous way to spend a day away from the crowds in such a quiet and beautiful place. For us, it was a must do."

History takes a back seat when you wander its emerald pathways and towering brick ramparts, with their dramatic views of the river and Prague Castle.

We started our circuit from the metro stop and went through the first gate, Leopold, from which bear right around St Martins' Rotunda and the Plague Pillar,whose faces are as close as you'll ever want to get to the real thing. There's many paths and leafy nooks to explore,as well as, a stunning cemetery ,where the nation's literary and cultural luminaries are buried and celebrated.  The church we encountered,on leaving the cemetery is Saints Peter and Paul,an elaborate gothic basilica with detailed stone reliefs, mosaics and towering castellated spires. At this point a cool garden is what we needed,so into the Sculpture Garden we trooped for a looksie at the larger-than-life Czech mythological heroes. From here we climbed the ramparts for the best vantage spots... the city laid out before us with red-roof tiles punctuated by church steeples with boatyards,marinas and bridges. Superb three hours of enchantment.peace and beauty."

The hilly place is amazing for the view over Vltava and the city.The church has a 30 czk fee (a fee to go inside and pray?!) so we didn't go in. There are some other expositions or places you could go visit for small fees but we just liked to enjoy relaxing on a bench. If you can, have a blanket with you and lay on the grass at the shadow of the secular trees. I think that for this place having a guide is useful, you can learn about the history of the place about the heavy imposing walls, the old buildings, the succession of regimes over Vysegrad and Prague.

One of its draw cards is its location high above the Vltava River and offers several lookout points with different views of the city. There are several brick gates, St Martins Rotunda and the Baths of Libuse ruins to see. The complex is dominated by the St Peter & Paul Cathedral. There is also a large cemetery with well tended graves. There is an interesting statue of St Ludmilla with several arrows sticking out. There is a small museum in the Gothic Cellars . There were a number of pieces of pottery, coins and religious vestments from over the centuries stored here, and scale models showing how the fortress looked over time. There are also various myths attached to Vysehrad, including one featuring the knights that were sleeping under the rock. It was believed that a lion would come out and roar once a year, and if there was no response it would return to the mountain. Otherwise if there was a response the knights would awaken to protect the city. It was also believed that St Wenceslaus himself would lead the knights. We skipped the casemates because we had just missed a twenty minute tour and it was another hour until the next one.Overall it was an enjoyable experience. The only surprise was that the complex with its many administration buildings had a more suburban feel to it than you would expect from a fortress."

We expected to see maps throughout the monument, but there weren't any - so pick up a map so you can see it all!This was a very peaceful and beautiful park-like area that overlooks the river and the Prauge Castle. There are several places to visit inside the monument. We walked along the walls and took in the views of the river, we visited the cemetery and admired all the sculpture and beautifully kept gravesites, we visited the Cathedral and the outside statue garden. It made for a lovely afternoon. Bring a blanket and Frisbee as this would be a great place for a picnic and to relax a bit. There were lots of little places to get food and drink. The WC's by the Cathedral were a donation to use, so make sure you have some change.We loved this park so much that we went back on our last night in Prauge. We stopped and had dinner at an Asian caf\u00e9 at the subway station and then walked in the to park. We made the first right and found the Beer Garden, which was full of people, which was full of people having a great time. It looked like rain so we headed further along the walls and in to the park. We had the most gorgeous view of Prauge Castle as the sunset and the lights starting coming on in the city. There was a concert taking place, and while we did not have tickets we were still able to enjoy the sound of the music with the incredible view. From the monument you can walk down some stairs to the riverfront and then it's a 10 min walk in to Old Town. Made for a very romantic last evening in Prauge."

Three weeks ago I took the Metro out to Vy\u0161ehrad, and it was a wonderful and leisurely afternoon. I visited the cemetery, where Jan Neruda, Bed\u0159ich Smetana and Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k are interred. The interior of the church is absolutely impressive, I was especially impressed with the Art Nouveau paintings. The grounds of the castle and fortifications are wide and sprawling, the park spaces are great for lounging around, and the views from the castle walls are breathtaking.I'm so glad I spent a leisurely afternoon at Vy\u0161ehrad, I feel it's a great counterpoint to Prague Castle. Vy\u0161ehrad does have it's share of visitors, though when I was there three weeks ago not to the extent of the crowds at Prague Castle. If you have the time in Prague, I highly recommend going out to Vy\u0161ehrad, and spending a relaxed, leisurely day there."

On my third visit to Prague, I was keen to visit Vysehrad as it had always been on my list but behind the usual spots. I was pleasantly surprised by the peaceful gardens containing the original statues from Charles Bridge & the fact that there were no entry fees to the grounds etc. We then went into St Peter & Paul's Basilica which I think is one of the most stunning art nouveau interiors I have ever seen. A couple who worked at the church and were fans of Mucha (who is buried in the crypt under the Slevin monument in the cemetery) undertook to paint the whole of the interior in his style. It really is beautiful and well worth the visit if you are a fan of that period."

They are located in the Brick Gate, which is at sort of the far end of the castle off Pevnosti. A guide is on duty and leads you on a tour. Each tour starts on the hour and lasts about 20 to 30 minutes. The ticket office is a little hard to find. It is on the left side of the arch under the Brick Gate. A sign is posted on the outside door, saying when the next tour will start. The price is cheap (30 crowns for an adult and 20 for a student or child). Although the place will seem deserted, do not give up. The guide is definitely there, either inside the office or outside sitting on a bench, and he gives the tours. He speaks hardly any English but is very friendly and helpful. He will lead you down some lighted corridors, then take you into a large room. When the lights are turned on there, you will see five or six stunning, well-preserved statues that date from the early 1700s. They are the originals from the Charles Bridge. We were blown away by their beauty and especially appreciated being able to see (and photograph) these icons of Czech history and culture. The guide's friendliness and humility made the whole experience THE highlight of our visit to Prague. One should not miss seeing these statues!"

Talk about doing things the hard way, so do use the metro/tram to get here it's more civilised trust me, and saves getting filthy looks from the wife in the process..!As for this \"Castle\" which is what it really is, I can honestly say this is where the locals come for some peaceful R&R and who can blame them as this historic place is very well kept and along with the spectacular views over the said river are something else. Do pay a visit for a small fee to the cathedral too and have a walk around it's also very peaceful as well as historical along with the church treasure room, which is well worth a look. As you leave here there are extensive gardens to explore and one can tell the locals as they tend to bring picnics, and have a great time with their families. Walking around you do eventually come to the ancient walls which border this place, and the glorious views over the river which on a clear day make good photo opportunity's. Even better if you want a snack at the many restaurants here and get a table over looking the river/city, and what a nice lunch this makes... We stayed up here for a few hours just walking around having a drink/ice cream etc, taking in the views before getting the metro back this time, which are situated just outside or take a tram, the other good thing about Vysehrad is it's downhill for the trams and there are no \"lager louts\" up here as everyone seems to respect this quiet corner of Prague, even the dreaded tour groups...A really nice way to spend a few hours..!"

However what makes this one of the high points of any trip to Europe ( and I have been there over 15 times) is the stunningly beautiful and powerful frescos(?) that cover every inch of the interior of the church. Painted by Frantizek Urban and his wife Marie in 1902-03 they are an art nouveau masterpiece that is a tribute to their mentor Anton Mucha (who is buried in the cemetary).

Just wandering around, you can get really nice views of Prague and also exploring the buildings and statues in the Vysehrad area.It feels very local. When I went, there were almost no tourists. Only locals going out for a jog, walking their dogs, or taking a romantic stroll with their significant others.Note: There seems to be only one entrance into Vysehard. Make sure you know which street it's on. Otherwise, you may find yourself circling around the half the fort before you can make your way up like I did."

There isn't a massive amount to see but all the attractions are low cost or free and we found them pretty interesting. For me one of the attractions is it's clearly a place frequented by locals as well as tourists so you feel like you've sampled a little bit of the real Prague. If you have a free morning it's a nice ride by tram along the river from Charles bridge and if you don't fancy a picnic you could call in at U kroka restaurant for a cheap, filling and tasty lunch on the way back to the trams."

They can be seen on a short guided tour on the hour, from a small shop door near the main gate entrance to teh fortress. Well worth the 60kc charge for admission (30 or seniors).And the monuments in the graveyard, to most of the famous Prague artists, musicians etc over the last 150 years or so have to be seen to be believed. They are an art gallery in themselves.The Catholic Cathedral at the summit has an interesting treasury , and also had some well built nativity scenes still on display when we visited.When you walk out of teh main gate, down to the railway bridge, don't miss the strange cubist houses inspired by the painting movement. Unique to Prague, and the villa with the complementary hedgework in the front garden is well worth a look."

Vysehrad has a very rich history, but what I think would interest people who travel to Prague the most, are the expansive views from above, quite different than the view from the Castle. Here, you get a beautiful view of the winding river Vltava, with all the famous bridges. It offers also a different view of the Castle in the distance. There is a beautiful St.Peter and Paul Church-beautiful, but an entrance fee must be paid. The centuries old cemetery (no fee), is quite fascinating, the tombstones are very artistic, sculptures are very unique and hauntingly beautiful. This is a resting place for many prominent families, painters, writers, musicians and composers. Among them, Bedrich Smetana and Antonin Dvorak (famous composers) and Alfonse Mucha (painter). For the czech people, and I still consider myself one of them, even after living in the US for many years, it is a trip back in history. Also, some of the famous people who emigrated to US, chose this spot for their last resting place. The park itself is quite lovely, but so is Kampa park, Strelecky ostrov and Petrin, and they are much more central. This is the first time, after many visits to Prague, that we found time to visit there. We were staying in hotel Aria (Mala Strana) and because \" time is money\", we decided to take a car arranged by the hotel for about $20 one way (very comfortable Mercedes ride). The great advantage:saving time and avoiding climbing the hill. The driver took us there from the other side (not by the river). I would not call a taxi on the street, they would surely drive you around circles, if you don't know the city.If you are staying in a hotel that picked you up at the airport-as many hotels in Prague do-then such ride could be negotiated. Later, we walked down the hill, many steps, took our time and many pictures. The tram, the stop is just at the bottom of the hill, is very convenient, stops at the National Theatre and you can exit there and be close to the Center. Next stop is close to the Charles Bridge. If you cross any of the two bridges, Legii by the Theater or Charles, you will end up in the heart of Mala Strana."

The park is pretty with nice sculptures. There are nice distant views over Prague and the castle. But the real stand-out for me is the cemetery where Dvorak and Smetana are buried. Both graves can be found rather easily, although you have to search a bit for Smetana which is at the back and Dvorak is nearer the front on the perimeter wall. There is a bust of Dvorak. The gravestone for Smetana includes the opening notes of The Moldau. The painter Mucha is also buried in a large group tomb. The various funerary sculptures of other persons are really beautiful, some very moving. One is of a woman stepping down toward her grave with her husband following behind, as if she is leading the way. There are many others. If you have a pretty day, you'll be glad you went."

Not quite as much a tourist trap as some of the more popular destinations, so you're less likely getting caught in a swarm of people. The downside is that there are not a lot of venues in this fortress that are available to the public, so there is a chance you will not get to see everything there that you might otherwise want to see. That is a minor issue in the overall location, as there is still plenty to keep you occupied. I would absolutely recommend this spot."

The main reason I went to Vysehrad was because it was close to the Congress Center, but I think it is definitely worth the short metro trip by itself. Our visit included walking through the cemetery (remains of many famous people from Czech history), spending time in the park, and seeing the basilica of St Peter and Paul. The best part was the view across the Vltava River, especially on a clear sunny day. I think this is worth the time if you have more than one day, as it offers a different atmosphere than other parts of Prague."

Hard to believe that some reviewers suggest forsaking Prague Castle in favor of this spot. It's a lovely parkland space, surrounded by a wide wall that offers a pleasant walk around the property and handsome views. The buildings are historic and handsome, the green space clean and inviting. There's just not much to it, and it probably doesn't need to feature on the itinerary of most first-time or short-term visitors.On the other hand, it's a quick, easy get-away from 'Tourist Town.' If you had any lingering doubt that the monument is aimed at the local population, not the occasional tourist, note that the information center's materials, including the map of the grounds, were offered exclusively in Czech. If your dream trip to Prague includes immersing yourself among Czechs in a quiet, lovely, outdoor setting, this is the place.A quick note about transit: Taking the C line of the Metro gets you to a stop that's a relatively short walk to the site. For variety, consider an alternative return route. Walk down the concrete stairway just outside the main property and proceed through a short pedestrian tunnel; follow the sidewalk down along a park and take another short tunnel under the railroad tracks. A block or so ahead you'll see a tram stop served by several lines. One of these - line 18 - take you through town and uphill directly to the stop for Prague Castle. You can buy tram tickets at the Tabak right at the stop."

Vesehrad is an ancient complex situated on a hill. There's a small park and few buildings within the old city walls. I enjoyed 4 big monuments connected with Czech history/legends (I think - there was no information about them either in the park or in my guide book). It is impossible not to mention a huge basilica of St. Peter and St. John. It's very old, but it was renowated in XX century, so its current outlook is not very roman. Unfortunately, you have to pay for the entrance to the church. We just had a quick look through the main door and decided that there is nothing special to pay for. Next to the church there's a cementary where importnat Czechs are burried (e.g. Alphonse Mucha). I'm not a fan of cementary visits so I cannot tell you much about it. We decided to visit Vysehrad, because many people say that \"It's a must\" when you are in Prague. Well... I think, it's not. Not much to see, really. I'm glad that I've stayed in Prague for 4 days and had time to visit everything. I can imagine that comming to Prague for a weekend and spending an hour or two in Vesehrad I'd have been quite dissapointed."

It's amazing how many different styles of graves/headstones are in there, as well as graves of many famous Czechs. We also enjoyed seeing the views from the top of the hill - one can see forever from up there."

We had a nice afternoon here, just strolling around. Also the church of st. Peter and Paul, which is placed here, is worth a visit."

First of all, it was a castle at some point, but it was not anything like Prague Castle or all of the other castles I have been to. I was call it more of a fortress and church now. I was there on a day when it was pouring rain- I had a coat ad hat so I spent a lot of time outdoors, but there was not a soul around and that was kind of cool, but also kind if eerie. The graveyard at the church has some of the most elaborate tombs I have ever seen (which includes some famous names like Anton Dvorzak) so that is also worth some time to explore."

Some nice restaurants in the park as well as just after the lower exit. The decoration of the interior of the Church of Sts Peter and Paul is partly art deco and beautiful to see. The adjacent cemetery is worth visiting because of the relevance and fame of its occupants and eclectic mix of headstone designs. Lovely river views and a nice green area to escape to from summer crowds."

The panoramic views are amazing and the park overall is a beautiful place you can wander in for hours (even the slight rain and the mean-looking black cloud heading towards the city didn't bother us). Didn't go in to see the church as by this point we basically saw more than enough churches for out whole stay in Prague but the cemetery adjacent to it had some very artistic headstones. Definitely a must visit an easily the most beautiful place in Prague!"

This is charming because it is in a neighborhood and is used as a park by regular, local people. We went early on a Saturday morning. The views were lovely. We could see the river and even crew shells out for a morning row. There is a wonderful portion where one can walk along the ramparts. Unlike some of the areas in Prague where everything is overrun by tourists, this is a little off the beaten path and is relatively serene. It was fun to walk along the ramparts and see the wonderful views of the city. It is a nice place to wander, think, and imagine.We went into the church, The Church of Saints Peter and Paul, which has also been rebuilt over time. I found it charming because the walls are decorated in art nouveau style. There are many depictions of saints, especially female saints, in the style of Alphonse Mucha, who is buried in the cemetery adjacent to the church. I don't think the wall decorations are considered to be the most important artwork in the cathedral, but I found them completely enchanting.From the Old Town, one can take the Metro up to the Prague Convention Center, then walk toward the church spires. Eventually, you will run across the brown tourist pointers which will point the way to the entrance. There is no charge to walk around the grounds. Entrance to the church is about $3.00."

There is lots of history happening here; including an important cemetary, a church, gardens etc. We saw some of the best views of our Prague trip from atop Vysehrad. The area is easily accesible by metro (or even walking) but feels further away from the action that it actually is. There were some interesting shops that were different and better priced thann those below. I found some beautiful handmade replica medievil glassware. The best part was later that same day when I saw the originals in the Decorative Arts Museum. If you have the time and want something to do that is quieter and slower paced, this would be perfect."

You can take a metro, but we usually prefer walking as it is the best way to see a new city! It's was just over 3 miles from where we were staying in the Mala Strana area and was a beautiful and scenic walk to get there following the river. If you have the time, the walk was no trouble at all! However, we did have a little trouble finding it at first.....walking along the river, there WAS a small sign indicating where to turn off to head up the steps to the park, but we missed it and had to turn back...so just make sure you have a good idea how far down the park is before you set off:) Another tip-we came in the back entrance of the park (where the stairs lead you right up to the cemetary and St. Peter & Paul church), and went up a series of many MANY steps. Would not recommend this route if you have trouble with steps, have a stroller in tow, etc. However, once we we were in the park area, we saw another more main entrance that seemed to be what all the locals used with flat cobblestone path.The park grounds are beautiful and many benches to sit and just take it all in. I absolutely recommend walking around the top perimeter of the fort, the views were spectacular and some of my favorite pictures from our trip were here. We followed the cobblestone path all around and saw many interesting buildings, as well as the amazing church. It was just a beautiful park with amazing views and gorgeous grounds. It was definitely NOT a tourist hot spot, which we loved. I really enjoyed the peacefulness of it all and seeing all the locals meet there!We went here on the last day of our trip and it was one our favorite memories by far! Beautiful and a much needed getaway from the Charles Bridge/Old Town Square tourist scene. If you make the time to get here, you won't be disapointed!"

It took until the third time I visited the city to walk my way up but I must have spent 3 1/2 hours visiting the gardens, Cemetery, Cathedral and the walking paths. It has some spectacular views overlooking the city and from some great angles as well. The cemetery is filled with Artists, Composers and other cultural icons from the Czech past. I brought a sack lunch and enjoyed it the garden while doing some people watching. If your looking for a good spot to picnic in Praha this would make a great place. You will avoid the vagrants who hang around Letna and the Train Station and there is plenty of room. It's a good walk up from the streets below but if you have been in Praha long enough you will be used to it. Plan on spending a couple hours here. Don't forget your camera."

The rain was pouring and it never really stopped. After having a nice late lunch at Kavarna Slavia we hopped on the train for the short trip to Vysehrad. Once off the train, there were no signs on how to actually get to the site. But because we knew that this was a fort on high ground and we were armed with a map, we found it fairly easily to find. It took us about 4-5 minutes to get to the site from the train station. Once at the site, we checked out most of the former casements and castle fortifications. This was the seat of the first Czech kings before the dawn of the 10th century. The views from the castle complex were great. We also visited a small museum that was in an underground cellar that offered a respite from the rain and was full of interesting objects. I spent a lot of time here as my husband had to leave to find a bathroom! The day was ending as we visited the Vysehrad Cemetery. Boy, was it spooky! Cold rain was pouring down, the wind was blowing, dead flowers lay around the graves mixed with new Christmas wreaths. Only a handful of people were about the site because of the cold and rain. We looked for the famous gravesites, but couldn't find any without a good map. Even though the rain was pouring, we still had a great time. We were armed with umbrellas and waterproof winter jackets and waterproof boots. I would definitely recommend this site because it gives you a break from the city, it is steeped in history, and the sprawling rocky hilltop complex is stunning!"

Also you can see and visit there a cemetery, where are many famous Czech writers, actors and artists and its for free. Also the price for the cathedral is very low. From Vysehrad you have a nice view on Prague and Moldau and a BIG PLUS for me is that there are not so many tourists."

The view of Prague is one of the best and while you are there, you must go into the Casement to see the collection of some of the ORIGINAL statues from Charles Bridge which are kept there to preserve them. The cemetery and the Church of St Peter and Paul are beautiful also. There are not many tourist visiting Vysehrad so that makes it extra special!"

The views, the gardens, the church, the cemetery - we loved it all. As an added bonus, you get to see the local side of Prague. There were only a few tourists at the Vysehrad, and just locals at the farmers' market below, which was both a delicious and fun experience (you eat your food, listen to the band, feed the swans, watch the river and the Prague castle in the background)."

Then visit the old church and the cemetery for interest and atmosphere. Exit the park and there are a couple of nice cafe bars as you enter the sloping street. Then walk a few blocks downhill to the river where you can walk back to the old town along the river banks, popping onto one of the islands along the way.

Vy\u0161ehrad is a historical fort located in the city of Prague only 15 minutes away from the town centre via the Metro. It was probably built in the 10th century, on a hill over the Vltava River. Situated within the castle is the Basilica of St Peter and St Paul, as well as the Vy\u0161ehrad Cemetery, containing the remains of many famous people from Czech history. It also contains Prague's oldest surviving building, the Rotunda of St Martin from the 11th century. It was the site of the first Prague Castle. Local legend holds that Vy\u0161ehrad was the location of the first settlement which later became Prague.We loved the church and thought it had the most beautiful interior we had seen and that's saying something considering Prague is full of beautiful churches. The grounds are so peaceful and the views over the river just lovely. When we visited everything was covered in snow but I bet the gardens and grounds are even more beautiful in summer. It's well worth a trip to."

We spent an entire morning walking the grounds of Vysehrad Castle -- even in the winter time the grounds were quite impressive with the view across the city while walking along the top of the outer wall. Equally impressive was the view of the Vltava river and Prague Castle, the second castle of Prague. Most impressive was the fact that Vysehrad was the founding point for the city of Prague back in the 10th century. There were various biergarten type places to stop and enjoy all the views from this location. It will be gorgeous here in the springtime when all the various garden areas and vineries start to awaken from their winter slumber! This would be a fantastic place for a summer picnic with all the trees and sights to see,"

The Church is highly decorated with Art Nouveau images. Its free to wander around. The churchyard includes the graves of Alphonse Mucha, Dvorjak, Smetana and the statuary is wonderful. You might walk past the cellars without a second glance but check them out. For 50KN (approx \u00a31.80) you are led down a .6km passage into a grand hall of six statues from the Charles Bridge. The Museum at the opposite side of the complex is also 50KN and is full of some of the first archaeology from Prague along with myths and legends of old Prague. All in all this was a really cheap day but fantastically interesting. An added bonus was the garlic soup in the Terrace cafe in front of the church.

The church here is incredibly beautiful as well. The red tiled door and sculptures on the outside are gorgeous! As you cross the front of the church heading toward the wall, the views of the city and the river are amazing. Try to go on a Saturday morning and then walk down the hill and across the road to the edge of the water to visit the Farmer\u2019s market.

You can walk on the walls of the fortress in a near complete 360 degrees with stunning views over the whole of prague including back at Prague Castle. One of the highlights of our trip and we would highly recommend it. It's a little further away than most Prague attractions but we walked to and from and it was very pleasant. A must do. If you walk there then don't forget to stop at St Cyril and St Methodius Crypt - a very moving and powerful museum that honours some very brave people that resisted German occupation. Probably our overall highlight of our time in Prague!"

Many people, myself included, comment that Prague is heaving with tourists ... but not here, though it deserves just as much attention as those much-thronged attractions in the City centre. It is easily accessed as it is just 2 metro stops from the centre. Get off at the Vysehrad station, you then have a walk of about half a mile - there is the occasional signpost.Vysehrad is enclosed in castle walls and is set very high above the Vltava - the views are absolutely spectacular. Looking down from the walls, you can make out the roofs of some of the cubist houses at the foot of the cliff. You can actually walk down to ground level - easier than walking up. The parkland within the castle walls is a pleasure to walk around and there are 2 or 3 places where you can stop for a drink or some food. Perched on the cliff face is a 14th century ruin of a watchtower, known as Libuse's bath - Libuse was the daughter of a mythical Czech king.The 2 main landmarks are Basilica of St Peter and St Paul and the National Cemetery. If you walk around the cemetery you will see quite a few famous Czech names on the grave stones.If you can get here when the weather is good, it provides an exceptionally relaxing experience, so don't tell anyone about it."

From this garden you can have awesome views of the Vltava river and part of Prague in the background. I strongly recommend a visit if you want to spend some relaxing, quiet time away from other tourists and take some incredible photos especially if you come in the late afternoon like I did. This place is popular mainly with czech families, couples, runners and walkers."

We went in summer, it was very hot and lovely to walk around the ramparts and see over the city and the river. I would recommend strongly not to miss the casemates, which could easily be done. Either approach from the Brick Gate or make your way to the Brick Gate (very easy, go to the Rotunda and keep walking on down the cobbled path until you see the big brick built gate) and go to the right hand side. There is a small exhibition or you can pay 50kc (adult, or 30kc for children) to go on the guided tour which is on the hour. It's not much of a tour as such, but you are taken through a cool tunnel (feels underground but is not) and after 5 minutes or so of walking you come to an opening of a big hall. It's dark and atmospheric, and you can see the 5 or 6 original statues from the Charles Bridge. I believe they use this for art exhibitions and sometimes weddings. The tour guide doesn't speak great English, so it's backed up by a printed sheet which gives all the information you might otherwise miss. Definitely a must see, very different!"

You'll find the graves and memorials of the great Czechs, especially cultural figures - composers Dvorak and Smetana, for example. It is a packed, chaotic graveyard, with remarkable monuments all competing for attention. There are marvellous examples of Art Nouveau, but also more recent, even modern, objects which can be very idiosyncratic (Czechs seem to have an eccentric streak). Like, a gravestone with a ski leaning against it? Or a caricatured face?"

The fee is 50 CK, the whole tour takes only about 20 minutes but it's something that you don't see every day! Especially because people concentrate on the better known sights up there you could be as lucky as we were; we were only four people visiting the place so plenty of room to admire the fortification walls from the inside and time to ask the guide questions."

Free entry and I think this is one of the oldest parts of Prague.A highlight is the national cemetery where many famous Czechs are buried.

I also loved the huge statues of the Czech mythological characters just outside - I wanted to know their stories. There was also a playground for kids with simpler versions of the legends. And finally, when I was there, there was a photo display about the holocaust and about how many children escaped to England by train. It was so well put together and I ended up in tears. After a little bit too much crowd (I'm not really a big city person), this was the perfect retreat for us for an afternoon. It felt somehow more personal and authentic than the more crowded areas. Well worth a visit if you have time for more than the Prague basics."

I was quite hesitant to write this review because, being a little selfish, I wanted to keep this beautiful gem a secret only for locals like myself to enjoy. Out of all the tourist destinations in Prague, Vysehrad is the least visited for one simple reason - it is away from the tourist track. You see, Prague has 3 metro (subway) lines, the red, green, and yellow lines. ALL of Prague's major attractions are on the green line...ALL EXCEPT for Vysehrad which is on the red line. And if you don't like riding on underground trains (you can't see anything after all), almost ALL of Prague's tourist destinations can be reached using tram # 22 and # 9. Unfortunately, the only way you can reach Vysehrad by tram is to take tram # 17 and hike up a hill.Why is Vysehrad worth visiting? A number of reasons. First. It is steeped in legend. From Vysehrad Hill, local legend says that Libuse prophesied that Prague will become \"a golden city.\" And when you are on Vysehrad Hill, you can see what Libuse foresaw...which leads me to the...Second. Vysehrad has a spectacular view of the Nusle valley and all of Prague. From one end of what is left of the medieval walled fortress to the other, you can enjoy a different view.Third. Take some time in the National Cemetery. There you will see the final resting place of some of the Czech Republic's most notable citizens (Mucha, Smetana, Dvorak).Fourth. The Minor Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul is a fine example of gothic architecture.and finally, Fifth. Vysehrad is not inundated with tourists. Yes, you will see the occasional student groups there. I myself have had picnics with several of my classes there. But for the most part, Vysehrad remains the locals' best kept secret."

            "review": "Vysehrad - A Forgotten Place to Understand Prague's History. What is known as the Vy\u0161ehrad Castle is actually a large area comprising different attractions that my wife and I slowly discovered while walking around the premises.Historians believe (without full agreement) that the castle was built around the 10th Century and that it became the first settlement to give birth the city of Prague. Strategically, it dominates a hill over the River Vltava (the famous Moldau River). No wonder Vy\u0161ehrad Castle means \"The Castle on the Heights\" or \u201cHigh Castle\u201d. Its 1,000 years of History saw various periods of oppulence and decadence, dominance by kingdoms around, armies from France, Austria and others, each one either attempting to destroy or to improve Vy\u0161ehrad. Most important of all, Vy\u0161ehrad so much participated in Prague's history that Czech kings considered Vy\u0161ehrad a place to stay or a historical route to go before being kings.What impresses anyone that visits Vy\u0161ehrad is its complexity as it contains a castle, now ruins of a large fortification, the beautiful Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, a Rotunda, large parks with plenty of statues, a casemate and the famous Vy\u0161ehrad Cemetery, everything surrounded by large walls and paths where one can walk between the walls and vegetation.In the 19th Century, the Vy\u0161ehrad Slavin Cemetery was built. Slavin means Pantheon and that is where many famous people were buried including Antonin Dvorak, Bedrich Smetana and many other many Czech composers, artists, sculptors, writers and intellectuals since 1869.The imposing Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul was built in the 11th Century, saw destruction and re-construction, being the last one at the end of the 19th Century.But, from everything we saw there, three things really caught our attention: the first one was the calm, large and relaxing park almost in the middle of the complex. I don\u2019t know why, but we felt some sort of peace while walking through the park and seeing big statues representing historical people, including the Libuse Princess which started a dynasty that ruled Prague for more than 400 years. Was it maybe because Libuse was considered to have visionary powers (I would probably say, today, a \u201cpsychic\u201d in a very good way) that prophetized Prague would be a big city? We don\u2019t know.The second thing that caught our attention was the astonishing view of Prague from the hill where Vy\u0161ehrad stands, with the Vltava River calmly flowing below. While we were there admiring that grandeur, I could not stop thinking about how inspiring was for Dvorak and Smetana to write the beautiful pieces of art praizing their beloved Prague. I could almost \u201chear\u201d M\u00e1 Vlast while on top of the hill.We stayed there for quite a while just feeling the scene, the vibration, the warm Sun and the light breeze.It did not go unnoticed for me a middle-aged man there with an opened book on his hands, occasionally reading it and then staring at the river and the surroundings, back and forth. Nothing in this ritual denoted fatigue or rush; on the contrary, he seemed to be relaxed and trying to locate himself in the environment. I could not resist talking to him. Because I was very frank in asking him directly that he was kind of seizing the moment there, in his bare English, he told me he was a Czech advocate often visiting that spot in order to replenish himself with the energy emanating from that place. He showed me his book from a Czech writer stating that the place we were at was exactly one of the four vortexes of positive energy located in Vy\u0161ehrad. Chatting a little bit longer, he translated for me another passage of the book \u2013 and that came as another surprise for me \u2013 although famous, Vy\u0161ehrad would not really be emphasized as touristic attraction because it would only \u201cnaturally attract\u201d those visitors that would \u201cfeel\u201d the vibration of the place!Well, well, well!... I don't know anything about energy vortexes, nor they would exist there, nor there would be such an \u201cattraction force\u201d driving some people to the place. All I know is that we where there and that we felt the relaxing environment and its beauty.Unfortunately, we had to leave Vy\u0161ehrad behind because we were heading to Paris on a more than 1,000 km drive through Germany.I hope one day we could go back there; this time, we would spend far more time to see and feel once more what we felt there. And we encourage you to do the same when visiting Prague. May the Vortex attract you to go there as well!"

It was a quiet and restful time away from the tourist \"hordes\" one finds at the main attractions. I enjoyed the exterior view of the 11th century Church of Sts.

For some time, it competed with the Prague Castle over the official seat of Czech kings. Vysehrad was built on a hill over the Vltava river. It is one of the monuments that you see from any place in Prague. Despite its excellent location, it does not get the attention of other sightseeing places such as the Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, Old Town Square etc. It offers a great view on Prague, an impressive basilica and a cemetery, containing the remains of many famous Czech people. There is a nice caf\u00e9 with normal prices. Vysehrad is actually one of the spots where Czech people go for a romantic walk or a meeting. We, Praga Medica, recommend Vysehrad to our customers as it offers a nice relaxing place after their laser eye surgery or any other medical procedure. Vysehrad is easily accessible by metro line C.

When you come out of the station, the motorway should be on your right and some office buildings on your left. Keep walking straight and you will eventually reach the old ramparts and the historic site, which you will turn right into, under the old gates.
