I went straight to the Global Village but it was closed till 4 pm, so I had like 3-4 hours to spare. The local cabbies told me about this garden but i wasn't interested at all on seeing any garden. But since there was nothing else to do around there I decided why not. When i entered the place it looked like any garden but as i went deeper into the garden I realized how wrong I was. I was completely amazed by the food court area with the colored umbrella on the roofs"

But if you go to Miracle Gardens, you can see a different Dubai. Soon you enter the park, you see flowers all around and I did not see such a garden at any where. In a desert city, such a beautiful flower garden!!!. Really amazing. One should not miss it. Many of the tourist packages do not cover this, as it is a little bit away from the city and the entry is also seasonal, I think it is from November to April (to verify). I visited in January 2016."

I found this a great way to spend an hour or two with guests when they visit Dubai - it is very cool to see such beautiful flowers, especially in contrast to a desert safari and the lack of green we have living here. The price is not too expensive - just make sure you go during the winter months... it does not have much shade and can get quite hot during the spring and summer."

It is really a miracle to have such a flower garden in a desert place.Relatively special type of tall green trees surround this garden.Beautiful flowers of different colours planted in earthen pots and are placed in different slots in specially made arches,some look like cottages,cars,train coaches,houses ,gates etc and various other shapes.Main feature of the garden is that flowers have been arranged in such wonderfully novel way giving an enchanting,captivating and eye-catching look to it.At first look one is mesmerized by sheer beauty of the flowers and their arrangement.Fountains add to the beauty and grandeur of the garden.Best time to visit is in winter 3 hours before sunset and the evening to enjoy the beauty of the garden during day time and evening.In the evening it is transformed in to a fairy land .Other features are beautiful display of coloured umbrellas,hung from bamboo roofs covering the eating places.A must visit place in Dubai.Bus service available from Emiraes Mall."

This park opens between December and Mid-may we visited early May and although the place was still very beautiful a lot of the displays with the flowers had started to die due to the increase in temperatures! I Would recommend the best visit to be in January when the flowers are in full bloom. There are Plenty of places to eat and drink. As soon as you walk in there is a photographer that will capture your experience and you have the option of buying your photos and memory usb at one of the desks within the park. There is an entry fee that is not too expensive for the experience you get in my opinion. There is a glow in the dark park that we missed out on as again it opens during the cooler months. My 4 year old also enjoyed the experience. My husband sufferes from hay fever and he was absolutely fine!"

Not to mention the wide array of floral arrangements and landscape that is pleasing to the eye. The flowers are no special breed, but the way they turn out on a landscape is really notable.Not too much crowd when you go on a weekday, that lessens the probability of photo bombers. The flowers die out on a summer so they are only open 'till April most of the time. Highly recommended!"

We visited in May, check when open as closes during the hottest part of the year and as already quiet warm/hot best time to visit is at night. Allow a good couple of hours + at least if you want to have a proper look around. Food and drink outlets inside so head there for a bite to eat in the evening and a look around and you won't be disappointed. Also trampolines (extra cost) inside for the kids but our 6 year old was very happy to wander around and enjoyed it as well.

How it is maintained in Dubai is breathtaking. The garden is nicely arranged with lot of themes like Peacoks, Eiffel tower, house, etc. Each & every corner is very good. My daughter enjoyed a lot. If we do not visit this place, it was really a loss. It is little away from the main city."

Please note if you are using the bus service you cannot pay by cash, you need to purchase a prepaid NOL card. This is very inexpensive and easy process and available in all metro stations and mall outlets."

Just before going in the mall take the stairs to go down to the bus station and get bus 105 (approx. 15 mins). Bus Stops you exactly near the back gate of the garden. Easy and cheap"

Respect to those who have taken hours of hard work with millions of flowers to create this garden.

I loved the Miracle Garden and decided to venture there because of the reviews on Travel Advisor and because it was listed as one of the top ten things to see in Dubai. I thought it was worth the ten dollar entrance fee, but it does lie outside of the metro limit. A taxi is needed. Make sure you use the official taxi (a taxi sign of the roof). There is a marked difference in Price Also, take the metro to the Mall of the Emirates, check out the Indoor ski slope, and then hop on a taxi from there. It is worth the trip, but I am apprehensive about recommending it because it is a matter of taste as well as the weather can impact one's experience. It might be too hot or too wet."

It is pretty much in the middle of nowhere and as it contains a large amount of flowers in the middle of the desert I guess that's impressive. However....The flowers are mostly the same, its more the quantity that is impressive and they are shaped into a large number of different shapes and objects. Unfortunately, rather than being really creative and / or artistic its rather childish and looks more like telly tubby land as one of my friends commented. If you've been to a proper flower or garden show in Europe then this pales by comparison as it lacks proper design. However, if you haven't then I'm sure it will impress.The other point of note is that there is zero information about the types of plants or even a section of plants perhaps showing what is native to Dubai and what isn't. There is no ecological information at all."

Miracle garden is an appropriate name considering it is in the dessert. The garden has a several variety of flowers in different shapes and colors. There are castles, Eiffel Tower etc and these have plastic fruits like oranges on its frame. I thoroughly enjoyed walking and viewing all different concepts. My favorite was an upside down VW red beetle car with water falls and a woman's face with flowers around the head. I strongly recommend a visit to the garden if you are in Dubai. There is also a play area for kids. I went in April at 6:00 p.m. and it was not too hot. Once the sun sets, the flood lights come on and the place is very well lit. Several concepts have lights that change colors. They have sitting area in case you want to take a break. There are stalls all around selling water, drinks and snacks and restaurants. The entrance fee is 30 Dirham. "

The name of this garden couldn't be more apt!Visited in the last month of its operation (garden is closed from May to September or October )Best time to visit is at dusk. Entry fee is slightly pricey at 30 dirhams per person including children . However it does make up for the ticket price when you walk inside and find yourself in a sea of various colorful beds of flowers and flower decorations. Everything is spotlessly maintained (like most Dubai attractions ) and the garden is floodlit after sunset so that you don't miss out on anything. It's not that big so that it takes only around 30-40 minutes to walk around and digest this miracle built in desertland!Plenty pf photo ops for enthusiasts. Also there's a large trampoline area to keep the young monkeys busy. Overall a thumbs up to Dubai authorities for daring to create a garden this size in this environment. Worth a visit to appreciate this concept."

We had woken early after our flight & were glad we arrived at the gardens when they opened at 9am. It was still pleasantly mild & very quiet so we enjoyed our visit very much. We walked around and took lots of photos before walking across to Butterfly World for a visit. We then grabbed a taxi back to the Mall of the Emirates. An early morning visit to the Miracle Gardens is perfect, although we have heard that a late afternoon/evening visit is also lovely. There are plenty of eating places, a children\u2019s playground, covered carts for hire, & other facilities here. It is also quite easy to find a taxi for the return journey (or the bus). The entrance fee is also quite reasonable in our opinion. We couldn\u2019t find the gift shop but were assured it was there."

We were there in the afternoon , it was pretty packed but we managed to go around and have some snacks and enjoy our time there. Nice memories here, would go again next year.

How many different ways can you present a Petunia?Billed as \"the world's largest natural flower garden\" I didn't know what to expect when I first visited Dubai Miracle Gardens, especially since it is located in the middle of the desert. I do have to give credit to the gardeners for keeping the Petunias alive in this location, and for the creative objects (cars, falcons, pyramids, etc) they complete cover in the flowers, but it's far from being a natural garden. Black sprinkler tubes crisscrossing every square inch of the gardens and watering timers are a must to gardening in Dubai, but are something I've never seen in a \"natural garden\" before.Dubai Miracle Gardens is a good place to take visitors for a short stop if they've already seen and done everything else there is to do in Dubai, otherwise, I wouldn't recommend making a special trip to visit it."

Miracle Garden is an innovative development wherein certain type of flowers suitable for local conditions and fruits (like oranges) are decorated in different arrangements in an outdoor botanical garden set up. The garden is kept open in non-summer months for obvious reasons and it is a pleasure walking around and click memorable pictures. The efforts taken to create and maintain the garden are laudable considering the local weather conditions.  The garden is adjacent to Butterfly Garden; however there is a separate entrance ticket and AED 50 fee per head for that garden. The fee for this garden is AED 30 per head and it is definitely worth a visit at least once. A family can easily spend 2 to 3 hours in the garden. If you also want to visit the Butterfly Garden then keep another minimum couple of hours at disposal. The garden is extremely crowded on Fridays being a common public holiday but Saturdays are better and of course the visitors to Dubai should plan to go there on week days. Ideal time of visit could be in the mornings or late afternoons. They have made ample arrangements in the garden for people to sit and relax, it is another thing that some people misuse the facility of stretching in the areas meant for a bit of a break for families and elders. They have a few eateries (outside food is not allowed) and washrooms. Parking is big enough. Travelling there by car is recommended although public transport is available from Mall of the Emirates and surrounding areas."

I used mobile apps to order a taxi but even that was very fast as this location is idle."

It was nice to see small majlis or seating areas throughout the garden, and I imagine they would be good nap spots.

Some of the famous buildings featured in the garden were clad in plastic faded oranges and other faux fruit with ruined its initial impact for the viewer. The price tag of 30AED does not, in my opinion represent value for money. Having said that the Egyptian fatayer vender was outstanding."

It is open late and therefore is lit up in the evening which hadn't occurred to me unfortunately and we didn't have time to stay later but would be worth planning to cover that too.An oasis, almost literally, after the rest of Dubai which is largely skyscrapers and a building site.Take a hat or umbrella as a sun shield if temperatures high, it was ok in March but will getter hotter of course."

The garden consists of iconic landmark buildings/sculptures covered in colourful flowers. I was expecting to see more variety in this regard, however it seemed like only marigolds were used. There are also several fresh juice vendors and fast food joints with a flowery food court situated in the central part of the garden.

The weather was a bit hot for a day in March but there are plenty of ways to cool down. The proximity to the butterfly garden is a good advantage and its well worth visiting, I wish they would have a discount for visiting both places, but they don't."

We are creating a mini version of the flower \"stream\" that represents water flowing from an urn and is so easy do do with pot plants. Apart from that the sheer beauty of the flowers and the flower \"houses\" are unbelievable to see. Peacock flower statues, flower monuments and many other stunning flower arrangements to be seen. Even if you are not a gardener, the sheer splendour of this display makes it a must see. Refreshments are readily available and parking is more than adequate. Don't miss this one."

It is spacious, different shapes made of flowers, lots of decorations, beautiful greenery. There is a food court, and some more shops of crafts. The garden can take around 3 hours, but you may spend a whole day there. You will take very unique photos at this place.Tips: - Ticket price is 50 AED, and working hours is till 7 PM, open only in winter.- There is a public bus (Bus no. 105) moves from bus station infront of Mall of Emirates, which drops you off, infront of the garden, with 5 AED. There is a bus every 15 minutes."

One thing that they like doing is to flatter other cities by imitating them with more flashing versions of their attractions. When you enter the Dubai Miracle Gardens you will feel as if you are in an Orlando, FL attraction. It reminds me of the now closed Cypress Gardens. The amazing twist is that this flower paradise is in the middle of the desert. This is a great destination for families with kids or grandparents. Bring your cameras!"

I've heard somewhere before about this place and remembered it on my recent stop over from Zurich going back to Australia.It's a little hike out of the city but be amazed with all the constructions on the way to the Miracle Garden.The entry fee is cheap for about what your going to see. Remember that all this is made made in the Arabian Desert. The water is pumped out of the ocean and diverted to drinking water. This place would need plenty of is.Passing through the gates you'll know straight away what an amazing place this is.In about 1 hour you will see all colours of the rainbow with a sweet flower aroma in the air. Furthermore the people who created this park need to be congratulated. The name MIRACLE Garden is true. I visited the garden on my own but want to return one day and go again with the family.This Garden is for young and old, great inspiration for gardeners too."

Don't expect smth very special, but enjoy a nice sunny day with a flowers and nice decorations. There are some places with fast food available in the territory of the park. The best way to get there is by car.Ticket costs 30 AED per person, you can either book it online or buy it in a cash desk at the entrance."

It was not too expensive and included the amusement park with the purchase of the ticket. There is also a butterfly garden there as well and wish the option to go there and not the amusement park was offered. Wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking involved. If someone in your party is not a flower lover there are benches to sit on, an area for kids, and also an outside restaurant area. This is only open in the cooler months so if you happen to be there take advantage of a once in a life time work of art with plants and flowers."

I enjoyed the scenes from a structure that is in the middle.We also took a small taxi( not sure what to call it but mini golf taxi) that gives you a full ride in 20 dhr.People do compare miracle garden with Kukenhof. I have visited both and its unfair to do comparison. Oranges n apples... !!On the other hand, the mistake I did because of these comparisons is time. I have visited Kukenhof and it takes full day.

There are no rides and the butterfly garden is separate and has its own entry fee of 50AED which was a bit disappointing as there is only enough to occupy adults for an hour or so. Attraction wise I can see why it's popular with families but there is nothing about it worthy of being declared a miracle garden!"

Miracle Garden is probably more suited to visitors to Dubai as opposed to us who live here simply because the cost of entry plus food and drink makes it pretty much a one off visit as opposed to annual one. It is however somewhere I would tell my visitors to go.Yes the flowers are beautiful and sculptured in all manners of fashion and it is a sight to behold. There are places to sit and just observe the flowers and insects. It is quite a surprise to see cars and houses made from flowers and there is an impact the first visit. I have been once about 2 years ago and havent been back but that's not to say it isnt worth that one visit.If travelling by car DONT park in the first car park - its twice the price of the one further down and ok you walk a little further but its not that far. Also the Butterfly Garden is in a separate part and it costs more on top and that is definitely on our annual list for a visit"

These gardens have PLENTY of seating space, mostly in the sub though so I'd definitely bring a large hat and sunscreen, lots of WATER if you are coming in the hotter months!Would have loved to see a variety of special flowers, maybe a tulip area, a rosegarden etc.Entrance is 30 AED which is about 8$/p. From here you can walk for a min to the butterfly enclosures. Loads of food stalls available here too with shaded seating."

Well, it is an amazingly well developed garden in the desert.It is one of those places which you honestly don't like but feel guilty to give a bad rating. There is no doubt that the amount of hard work put in making and maintaining the garden is literally miraculous. But when you put this place amongst desert safari, Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa trip, Atlantis, Global Village etc. it just doesn't match the ante. If you are having a leisure trip of Dubai or stay at Dubai / Sharjah, then this could be a good destination to go visit on the \"rest day\" of your trip. And like many others have said, it is a good place to visit with family. You can while away a whole day even if there are kids and old people in the group. It is not a happening place. But it is not just as boring either. One thing though, if you are into colorful abstract and macro photography, you will love this place. Lots of wallpapers assured. Best time to visit: enter an hour or an hour and half before sunset. The lighting would be perfect to enjoy the colors of flowers and to capture them on camera too."

Day time if the weather is cool.Description:I visited this place with my family and we all were really thrilled with the beautifully arranged flowers!!You can spend more than 3 hours here without getting tired. The flowers were arranged in a house shaped, peacock shaped structure and flowers just poured life into these man made structures!! replica of Burj Khalifa and Eiffel tower was a good sight. Kids, adults and old people will enjoy this place a lot!Allow yourself atleast 3 hours to enjoy this place thoroughly.I would suggest you to first see the place first once and then start taking snaps. Most of the tourists were busy taking snaps/videos and forgot to cherish the natural beauty of the flowers.How to reach:From Dubai you can take a metro till Emirates Mall. From Emirates mall you have RTA buses every 15 mins to the garden. If its Friday then Metros will not start untill 10:00 AM so better hire a cab. We were six people and hired a cab which costed around 100 Dhs from Bur Dubai. There are plenty of buses to and from the garden and they operate till late evenings so no worries if you plan to stay late. Maintain sufficient balance in your NOL cards (RTA bus cards) for your return journey.Pros:(i) Awesome concept, beautifully constructed and very well maintained.(ii) Plenty of benches to sit and enjoy the colourful flowers.(iii) Terrific place to take beautiful snaps.(iv) Reasonable ticket costCons:(i) Overcrowded on weekends. So, difficult and irritating to take snaps because everyone keeps walking in between.(ii) Outside food is not allowed inside the premises. So, fill your stomach before visiting this place.(iii) Cafeteria is very expensive. Final Verdict:Awesome place and a must visit for people of all ages."

There are many kinds of different flowers and at the time we visited, each garden, building was bursting with blooming flowers of all types of colour, shape and size. Entrance costs 30AED (seems expensive at first, but when you look at the effort and price of maintaining this garden, the entrance ticket is nothing). We took a round of the garden in a buggy with 2 stops for taking photos. The Buggy ride costs 20AED and quickly gives you an overview of the garden so that you can plan to cover the garden at leisure later. The ride takes about 10 minutes and then you are on your own to cover on foot.Buildings are put up and covered with plants with flowers. So they look very colourful. There are different shapes of constructions and there are plants and flowers everywhere. This is a heaven for photography - for capturing different colours, macro and wide angle photography.It is impossible to write everything that the garden has. One has to visit this place to truly admire the garden (specially given that this is in the middle of a desert). There is also a butterfly garden attached to this - we could not cover the butterfly garden. There is a cafe with a ceiling of colourful umbrellas to refresh yourselves.A minimum of 2 hours has to be reserved to do justice to this garden and this is a must visit place for visitors of Dubai."

The Miracle garden is truly a miracle of sorts, since we cannot fathom the efforts required to maintain an flowering garden in the Desert of Dubai and that too in uncontrolled conditions. Visit this place only if you love seeing a garden landscaped to perfection. Plants and flowers are creatively grown and that is all there is to the place. The flowers are the same, seasonal varieties throughout. If the sun is beating down, the only shade is provided by cafes and food courts. The place provides good photo op's, if the crowds don't photo bomb you. One needs to patiently wait for crowd to disperse if you need photographs without people. Even during a off peak day the place was crowded. The place is quite noisy too, with the continuous whistling of the security, who have to constantly remind stupid people (a large majority of the crowd) that it is not correct to walk on flower beds and also wrong to climb on creepers, just for a photo op. There is a butterfly garden nearby, but we did not visit it."

Sculptures made from flowers & some made of oranges & lemons, so plenty to see. It's a very large round park & can get very warm in the sun. They're are not many shaded areas apart from the open food court in the middle of the park which are shaded by multicoloured umbrellas.. A beautiful sight in itself. The food on offer is great & again reasonable. Shops selling fresh tea/coffee and snacks like pizza, chips & ice creams.. The kids will love this place, just be careful not to walk on the grass areas, as you will soon a very loud whistle shooing you off..! I was there at the beginning of Feb when the temperature is no more than 25 degrees, but believe me, it feels much warmer in the bare sun that shines on you, in this vast open space. Plenty of photo opportunities all over the park. All in all, a must see. Lots of flowers, plants & places to enjoy, a true miracle seeing such vibrantly healthy gardens in a scorching desert......, after all, that is what Dubai actually is, a desert..! Have fun... x"

It's far from the city so I suggest you go there first and then to the global village since they are close and may be you could go to mall of the emirates first . Another mistake was going before the sun sit the butterfly garden as closed and we took pictures at the dark even though there were good lighting . I don't really think it deserve the 30 Durhams ticket. The flowers there are average there were no special kinds of flowers but they where presenting them in a spectacular way. It's a bit like taking a break from the malls and visiting a natural place for a change."

I can understand though, as a garden that big is not that easy to maintain. If you go in the early evening, it can be a good walk with the family, take some nice holiday pictures but that's it really... don't forget to bring cash as you have to pay the entrance and maybe get a drink inside... there are no ATM close to the area."

Very friendly staff and a lovely idea of upside down umbrellas to catch stray flower petals and also to give shade. It is part of the hop on/off bus routes as well. They is nothing else to do once you have visited both sites so you need to check on the return bus times.Would recommend if you want a relaxing time away from the chaos of malls etc"

We walked around took lots of pictures and left thinking it was well worth the trip. In my opinion if you are in Dubai and have the time I would differently put it on the list of things to do in Dubai.The Garden is open Weekdays: 9AM to 9PM \u2013 Sunday to ThursdayWeekends: 9AM to 11PM \u2013 Friday and Saturday"

However, no edibles allowed inside...so I had to leave my bag outside the gate on an unattended chair. I got it back after 1.5 hours, as is :-)This garden gives several opportunities for photography. Because there is always more beautiful shapes ahead. Be careful not to touch, though the guards ensure that very well. A great garden to visit in the winter!"

We hadn't heard of it previously, however on arriving in Dubai for part of our honeymoon, it was recommended to us by multiple people and it was really worth the trip out to it. It is quite a way out from the city in a remote area. Plenty of food and drink places when you are there. Take a camera as there's a photo opportunity around every corner!"

It\u2019s a \u201cMust Visit Place in Dubai\u201d. Usually Autumn (Oct \u2013 Nov) to Winter (Dec \u2013 Feb) is the best to time to visit Miracle garden. I would suggest visiting the garden in day light to feel the magnificence. In Autumn you can plan for a visit around 4pm in the evening, so that you can see the garden in day and night light. In Winter I prefer visiting the garden around anytime between 10am \u2013 4pm, due to the extreme weather condition by evening. Plan a relax day out at Miracle garden - Take a stroll around the beautiful garden. Bring your cameras along to get some memorable clicks. Grab a bite at the food corner. Relax with a book or music.Timings: 9 am - 9 pm: Weekdays | 9 am - 11 pm: Weekends (Friday & Saturday)Fee: Regular Admission AED 30/- per person (Free for children 3yrs old and below)"

The place has an amazing collection of flowers of all varieties-not a flower expert myself so reallly can't name them. It was a visual delight, very well maintained and has some quaint eating place within to have small snacks, refreshing coconut water and tea/coffee. We spent about 90 minutes in the place but you can easily spend a half day or more easily - it is so beautiful. A nice place to have a picnic for a leisurely family outing specially if you have young kids. There was a queue to purchase the tickets but I understand the tickets can be purchased online also. December was a pleasant month to visit. Photographs to follow. Worth a visit if you are in Dubai on a holiday."

The last time I went was in 2014 February and their decoration was hearts and romantic. This year, I saw new stuffs like the Eiffel Tower, Burj Khalifa, Japanese Castle (?) and Windmills. They were all in mustard/tangerine/orange colors and they look great in photos. The Burj Khalifa changes colors at night while the Eiffel Tower also had its on and off lights. Beautiful.The food was quite pricey but we manage to eat ice cream (ordinary quality) for 10 dhs a scoop. Average rates of food (no drinks yet) was 25-30 dhs. Luckily, I bought some taco wraps with salmon and lettuce that I wrapped in a foil. So good that it was perfect for that trip.Entrance was 30 dhs per head but we got a great deal from our FGB credit card, buy 1 take 1! Whoa! :-) Parking was ample though you need to walk quite a bit if you happen to arrive on the peak hours. We arrived at 3pm and managed to get a parking quite near the place -- after taking rounds.Toilet (female) was okay but very few -- like 4-5 cubicles only.

It is obviously very difficult to grow or keep alive so many flowers. The climate is simply not really suitable for flowers. Avisit to Miracle Garden therefore is best done in the winter say from november to march.You don't know what to expect and for most tourist it is probably half an hour drive from their hotel.On arrival you notice that they are ready to receive and welcome lots of visitors. When we came you could say it really was very quite. After entering through big wooden doors you step into the gardens. Paths leading you through all kinds of themse from windmills to upside down houses or small trains (country themes as they carry flags from different countries). After several visits to Dubai I was wondering where to go to next. This was on the list. It wasnt the most impressive excursion I have done in my life and I would not recommend this to first time visitors to Dubai. However if you have been here sevral times and you have nothing to do on a lazy sunday afternoon, just go there an hour or so and enjoy. It saves you a trip to the \"keukenhof\" in Holland where millions of people go to every year."

A very clever irrigation system makes it possible. We have been before and understand the theme is changed periodically as is the colour scheme. There are shapes of all kinds the made out of flowers and huge expanse of areas covered in flowers. It is a place not to be missed. We have visited in summer and it was still beautiful."

We were staying along the Dubai Marina and caught a taxi to the gardens - which was a 15-20 minute drive. The gardens are incredible! The detail of the flower displays and shapes will blow you away. I'm not a massive flower or gardening fan, but I was able to appreciate the magnitude of the gardens and how much time, effort and work has gone into keeping it pristine and well maintained. The creativity and beauty of the flower displays is something out of this world. Take comfy shoes, because you'll do a fair amount of walking around the garden. If you stick around the gardens until early evening, the queues to get a taxi back will be really long and may take a while - just be patient."

There is a lovely area inside where you can sit down and have a snack too as well as kiosks all over the garden selling snacks. There's also a service where you can be driven around the garden in a golf kart. You do however have to pay a little amount of money for that but it's nice if you prefer not to walk.

The idea of so many manicured gardens, three dimensional structures covered in flowers and flower beds in a desert region was intriguing, and captured the imagination on arrival. Sadly, however, many of the same flowers were used throughout the attraction, and the items on display were quite repetitive. It was also very disappointing that the butterfly house was not included in the ticket price, and we did not find the edible garden that was mentioned on the website.The gardeners obviously worked very hard to present it so beautifully, and the birthday clock was a nice idea. Unfortunately though, it only took a bit over half an hour to view everything on offer.We were glad we went early so that photo opportunities without crowds were possible. However at that time we didn't feel like stopping for food so this made the visit even shorter.All up, although a novelty attraction, it was a bit disappointing."

You are not allowed to bring picnics in, or picnic blankets of any kind or scooters, skateboards, games etc. now I can see why you are now allowed to sit on the grass as people would soon ruin the hard work of the Gardeners and trample over flower beds and there were so many people there that kids on scooters etc would be hazardous. Fair enough, but we didn't realise this and so came with different expectations. We went on a Friday at about 1-2pm and it was sooooooo busy that it took some of the joy out of it. If you don't like crowds sticking selfy sticks in front of themselves everywhere you walk then perhaps go early morning or not on a weekend if you can help it."

Decided to pay a visit to this place since the weather was good and I have read so many good reviews...It was really disappointing...There was a lack of directional signs leading to this place and the roads were narrow causing a long queue on the day we visited. Parking space was very limited as well...The queue for the tickets was worse than the traffic jam as only two ticket booths were available....There wasn't anything special in the garden except lots of very ordinary garden flowers formed as houses, hearts, and different shapes....Having visited botanical gardens in Singapore (including Gardens by the Bay) and London, this garden is comparatively very normal and basic....there is no educational materials and everything in the garden are easily available in any garden centre or nursery...I usually take lots of photos when visiting gardens but on this occasion, I really didn't feel like taking pictures of ordinary flowers and Burj Khalifa or Eiffel Tower made from plastic oranges....And the plants are not that well maintained either...."

Many people were telling us that it was a great place and finally we achieved to go there.PARKINGParking problem was tremendous. For the fact that this place is in the outskirts of Dubai, the parking problem could be solved easily. The staff which is arranging the parking is not skilled at all. Somehow they are random people who just do this job volunteering, at least this was the impression. TICKETINGThis is an amusement park. Similar to Disney Land, similar to Universal Studios. It is a place where happy people come to enjoy and to spend time and money. But if the person at the ticketing office does not even look at your face and while ticketing he does not even smile, this gives a bad taste. For 30 AED I expect that this person at the cashier welcomes me at least with a \"Good Morning Sir\". But obviously this expectation is too high.ENTRANCEA huge crowd, unorganized, no overview and just chaos. Absolutely not Dubai-like. What we experience in Dubai is mostly run for excellence. But here we experienced the opposite.IN THE PARKHonestly, it is not my job to give ideas. My job is to pay AED 30 and to enter and to enjoy a day escape. I have been to many places in my life, such as Disneyland, Universal Studios, SeaWorld, EuropaPark and also Global Village. But I have never had to listen to folks songs or traditional music which was first of all too loud, and did not match with the theme. This kind of songs which this park is playing you normally hear in tea houses where frustrated people sit and sip their teas. How about playing smooth classic music? At the end of the day these flowers are not local flowers, they are most probably from the western part of this world. So it would not be contradiction to play also western influenced modern classic music.Apart from the music, for AED 30 I expect a bit more clean environment. For this you need to hire staff who are cleaning.How about a kind of Chu-Chu train for kids? In places like Ibn-Battuta or Festival City Malls they have such a train which drive kids around and they enjoy it. How about healthy food in a green nature park? I looked at the food option, it was totally junk food oriented. In a park where the theme is nature I would suggest that people can eat healthier food than in a random food court. After so much critics I must say the flowers and the colors are nice. In fact the idea of such a park is amazing, especially knowing that it is in a desert country, makes me happy to see this. But the execution of how the park has been set up and how it is managed, makes me very very sad."

We got the bus from the mall of the emirates at 14.00 they run every 20 mins after this and cost 5 diram each way. Enterance to the garden was 30 dirams money well spent. The gardens are amazing plenty of seats round about and kiosks for drinks and food. The toilets are plentiful and very clean.We spent 3hours here and said we would come back before we leave.I loved every part of the gardens and it would be hard to pick a favourite but I would say it is the clock. Before we left we went to the butterfly farm. 100 diagrams I felt was a bit expensive to go in but we went. Lovely to see but I will not be back there"

There are also lots of volkswagon beetles covered in flowers and acting as a fountain. Truly bizarre but worth the reasonable entrance fee. It is amazing that such a showy, flowery place is in the desert! Don't bother with the butterfly place, seemed rather expensive, and beware that you don't get ripped off by the food stalls in the courtyard area, I'm pretty sure we were."

It's basically an extremely colourful park that recreates buildings such as the Burj Khalifa out of flowers and fruits. Although it's lovely I think it should have be included in the price of the Butterfly Gardens. I don't think it's worth the 30 aed price. Then again it's one of Dubai's cheaper attractions and it is amazing to see all that colour in the middle of the desert. We entered via gate two, walking about two minutes from the Butterfly Gardens and maybe didn't get the same experience as coming through the main entrance. We were bored after about 30 mins and there weren't any cafes or restaurants to stop and rest in, though there were food vendors dotted around. We probably won't visit again but worth a visit once."

The garden opens in November (closed during summer upto Oct) though it is located at the outskirts of Dubai, it is worth the visit. You will also get eating stalls inside the garden You will have to walk a lot inside the garden and hence, visit during the evening hours, say after 4 pm. The entrance fee is Rs.30 Dhrms per person"

You'd probably need to spend about 2-3 hours to really enjoy the place. However, I would strongly suggest bringing your own car. We came by taxi and by the time we were about to leave the place there was a long queue of people waiting for taxi. You need to wait for a taxi to pass by, which is not very often. Overall, it was an experience of a lifetime."

My first ever visit to the Miracle Garden this morning with friends from South Africa who we are hosting for a short stay in Dubai.Perfect weather with overcast conditions and a light breeze for walking around this open air venue. It showcases an amazing variety of flowers and floral sculptures including scale models of a Windmill, a train with a locomotive, the Burj Khalifa and the Eiffel Tower. An amphitheater, a small lake with fountains and sculptures of flamingos, a floral clock and several other floral works are also on view. A perfect setting for taking pictures and videos with benches available for periods of rest, and several outlets serving food and drink on the premises.We were lucky in terms of not many people being there and could walk around at leisure. Ample parking is available outside the three entrance gates and the entry fee is a modest AED 30/- per person.Definitely not a viable place to visit during the hot summer months. A must see in good weather for all residents in the UAE. The only issue with the location in DubaiLand is the lack of public transport and having a car is essential."

Generally people queue up and give you the chance to take pictures in front of the many wonderful displays, there are sometimes that the people waiting are still in view of the picture you are taking don't hesitate to politely ask them to step away. At the beginning we were slightly reluctant to do this but then we found people don't mind and sometimes they are not aware that they are in the way so it is worth asking!There are many seating areas in the shade where you can take a rest before continuing with your walk around, there is plenty to see! There are also kiosks where you can get food and drink around the garden!We used a taxi to get to the garden and there are taxi's around to get back to where you need to."

Too much good feedbacks about this wonderful piece of land by my friends and we visited with certain level of expectations. Apart from the scorching sunlight, I do not have anything to regret our visit as this is simply marvelous. The idea of sporting an area clustered with different flowers in combinations which are pleasing to eyes is nothing more than intelligence. The garden is well sculptured and planned in an integral manner so as to give good retreat to anyone visiting here. Be it hanging baskets of flowers, Floral clock, flower shrouded train or well groomed grass to portray the famous iconic buildings, we enjoyed each and every view.Plenty of photo opportunities and anyone visiting here are advised to bring a good SLR to capture the beauty of this place to later reminisce. Parking was easier as there was plenty in the front and a bay across the slim road. You can be easily guided into this garden as there are attenders standing along the path giving directions. Home cooked food is not allowed inside; however there is no dearth of food outlets inside. This is open only during certain phase of year from winter to mid of following year.Must visit for anyone coming to this city (Dubai)."

Arguments about waste of water aside, the Miracle Garden does at least get something for the resources employed. The artistic arrangements of plants into the shapes of buildings, cars, birds etc, is perhaps a tad kitsch but really when you see it you won't mind. It's a visual feast (not an olfactory one - these sorts of flowers have no scent to speak of) and particularly good for a mixed group on a nice (winter - Oct to April) day as small children and grandparents will enjoy equally. There are adequate facilities too - food outlets, prayer tents, toilets so once you're in you can relax happily for a least a few hours if not all day."

It is really miracle to see this blooming garden in the mid of a desert. the hard work of the staff and labourers of the garden are to be appreciated..... it was maintained clean, refreshing and lot of photo opportunities (selfies!!)Though as flowers, it is nothing that could be compared to the mesmerizing swiss or Denmark and other European countrysides.... but it is a wonder and a good relaxing place to shed your tensions in a spring afternoon..... You have to walk a lot with resting inbetween. bit expensive for just clicking some photos and taking rest... but for the effort they take, this money (the entry ticket) is nothing. do not expect lots of flora varieties, but it is the landscaping that's special."

            "review": "Some Bad, Some Good, But Quite Memorable. The Dubai Miracle Garden is a most unusual attraction. It has some aspects that are not so great, but these are easily outweighed by the uniqueness of the attraction. There are two different garden areas to see - a main one and a secondary garden that includes a butterfly habitat and several large-scale garden outlays. Together, a trip here makes for a memorable experience.The BadThe cost of entry to the main garden is fair by Dubai standards (30 AED), but if you want to see the second set of gardens and the butterfly area you will need to pay a second substantial fee (I can't remember the exact amount, but it was a good deal more than just an additional 30 AED). We didn't want to pay the extra fee, but we figured we might as well since we had made such an effort to reach the gardens.We visited the gardens in April and they still had Valentine's Day displays on show. While there's no harm in keeping these up, it shows a certain lack of attention to detail. The garden is situated in a part of town around which there is a lot of stalled construction. While the garden displays are nice, the background leaves a lot to be desired. Additionally, there are light poles all over the garden and these get in the way of pictures and the general experience.Several parts of the park had a pseudo Disney feel. There were items that were clearly meant to mirror specific Disney characters. For example, they had fairies that looked just like Tinkerbell and cars with facial features reminiscent of the movie Cars. Several of the signs also used a very Disney-like font. While this is not necessarily a problem, the gardens are nice enough that they don't really need to copy anything else, and it comes across as a bit of a distraction.Some of the displays were a little worn and in need of a little attention. There were spigot waterfalls designed to give the impression that the spigots are floating. These were somewhat dirty and the flow of water was not sufficient to complete the illusion.None of these issues are so bad that they should prevent you from seeing the gardens. There are plenty of excellent features to make your trip worthwhile. The GoodThe colors that can be seen around the garden are incredible. This makes for wonderful pictures and quite a splendid sight to see. It's a great place to take pictures of people as the flowers make a nice backdrop.Creativity abounds in the designs of the different portions of the garden. There is an excellent umbrella-lined walkway that throws interesting shadows on the ground while shading those walking underneath. There is a small village where the houses are made entirely of flowers. There is a functional clock made of flowers and several other original floral creations.The bathrooms were clean and free to use and there was ample free parking.The butterfly gardens featured a lot of space for interactions with the main attractions. They offered food that we could hold out to entice the butterflies and there were several times that the butterflies landed on us to rest. This would likely be especially enjoyable for children.Final ThoughtsIf you decide to make the trip, be sure to check on potential closings. The main gardens are closed in the summer, but the butterfly gardens remain open. If you do want to see the butterfly gardens, you will need to exit the main gardens near the back (not far from the umbrella walkway) and walk through a tree - lined path to the adjacent second garden area. If you get confused, just ask one of the security guards and they will point you in the right direction. Even though we came in the spring, it was still quite warm outside and the sun was a force to be reckoned with. Make sure you plan accordingly by either showing up early or late in the day, or at the very least by using plenty of sunscreen. There is a decent amount of walking required to see all that the gardens have to offer, so comfortable shoes would also be a very good idea.The Dubai Miracle Garden is unlike anything you've ever seen before and serves as a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the city. If you have the time, it is well worth the trip out to see the flower creations on display. Bring a camera and you are bound to get some excellent pictures."

There are billions of Flowers planted in this garden and that's not just the end. The real beauty is the Flower Art that they've created with a very well maintained atmosphere and which increases the \"Stars\" when it comes to rate this place. It's Huge. You may click your pictures too. The entrance fee of this garden is just around 35 AED (Dirhams) so far and that's nothing when you see such a place that could be titled \"Heaven On Earth\". I'd recommend the tourists to make it a mandatory visiting this garden during the trip to Dubai. Thank you for taking your time reading my suggestion. I hope you feel the same about the Miracle Garden during your visit."

The gardener and the architect who made it and maintain the garden richly deserve appreciation for their creativity and skill and care put in to this \"Miracle Garden\".It is another must visit attraction in Dubai."

It took us between 10 and 15 minutes to reach the gardens from the Springs area (add another 5 minutes if you're travelling from the Mall of the Emirates). There are three entrance gates, so do ask to be dropped off at the main gate (great place to start the visit), as the other two gates are deserted. We paid 30AED per adult ticket and got there at 530pm to enjoy the sunset and cooler weather. We spent 90 minutes walking in the gardens and bought some drinks from the food court (which was also serving hot food: hot dogs and other snacks). There are toilet facilities there too.There are magnificent designs in the forms of the Eiffel tower, Burj Khalifa and a small village; all covered in foliage and vegetables. Cleverly made and presented! The peacocks were stunning and it's worth taking photos in the romantic, light tunnel just behind the convoy of old Mercedes cars (also filled with various plants!).Taxis going back to the city can be easily found from gate 2.Our trip was a welcome alternative to spending time in a mall and we thoroughly enjoyed our time."

The features like the cars and houses and windmills with the flowers are interesting enough but there was no wow factor and I think that children would be more impressed. The gardens are kept very clean and there were a lot of workmen/gardeners maintaining everything. Would have been nice to have like a glass conservatory with air conditioning where you could have a refreshment. The refreshment section which had juice bars in the middle was just an open space covered with vines/leaves however it reminded me of Sharjah back in the 80s the way the kiosks were very out of date shame really. Overall it was an okay experience but would not say to anyone coming to dubai unless they are from the regiion as a tourist this is something they should do much more impressive tourist spots."

I took my camera and hardly used it.Oh, and watch out for those (horrendously unsociable in crowded places) Selfie sticks, I think they must give them away free at the entrance or grow them there. Very annoying.If the name of this place was just \"Gardens\" I would have been impressed.LOLZ available at the attempted flower sculpture of the Burj Khalifa.

            "review": "Nice, but not miraculous.... Firstly it is important to note that to visit the Miracle Garden you must do so via a car you own/rent or by taxi. Public transport to the area is terrible/non existent. A taxi rank is near the entrance for your return journey. If you are getting a taxi I'd recommend you go from Mall of the Emirates due to close proximity and guarantee of getting a taxi easily. The Garden is well maintained, clean and organised to make navigation between the sections easy. Perfect place to take visiting older relatives to take nice memorable photos, particularly if you like panoramic shots. There is an elevated section in middle of garden for just such photos. Please be warned though that ramp up to this area is very steep, if you are pushing a pram or a wheelchair up and down be cautious. On negative side it is a fairly expensive entry price (30 AED) for somewhere you are unlikely to spend more than a few hours at. Entrance to the butterfly garden is another 60 AED on top of original price. As no areas have AC you're also looking at spending a small fortune on drinks or ice creams to keep the kids cool and happy. Much better to go in winter time or early evening so you can enjoy a walk around in the cooler climate."

The garden itself is neatly laid out, it is a big circle, with different themes, e.g. old cars halfway buried in the ground (?), a bit of Paris, etc. The flowers lack variation, most are the same of two kinds in varying colors. The day we visited the Garden it was very hot, so it became very apparent that there is no restaurant, nor anything else that resembles a space with AC. So we thought about going to the butterfly garden, but tickets are not included in your 30 Dirham entry fee, and we were not sure if there was a cool down area at the Butterfly garden, so we skipped it and left after 30 minutes visit. This is a nice outing probably in lower temperature weather, and if you manage your expectations..."

There is no other words that come to mind once you stand in the middle of all this flower magnificence. It's the celebration of imagination above everything as well as an excellent example of landscape design. You will see peacocks, cars, houses, Pyramids and an Eifel tower made of flowers, visit an Umbrella's Valley,see the water tap hanging in the air without any pipes with water dropping right to the lake (yes, yes! don't ask me how, just see it)! It's the best place to make wonderful and memorable photos, walk with children, just sit and enjoy pleasant smells, beauty and tranquility of this place. Ticket costs around 10-15 usd for adults and you can stay there the whole day, no one limits you.You will find multiple cafes in the rest area, where you can enjoy a well deserved cup of indian karak chay, freshly squeezed pomegranate juice or Egyptian bakery with cheese, Feta or Nutella inside.Butterfly garden is now open for visits too and the price is included in the ticket. If you go in summer, try visiting Miracle Garden in the Morning or in the evening around 4-5 pm to escape the heat."

The drive from Jlt area was about 20 mins as the gardens are located just past Sports City. It was a hot day and we got there around 1pm. We were not disappointed. The flowers were looking beautiful despite the hot weather and were clearly well fed and watered. The grounds are huge and filled with so many different types of flowers in every colour imaginable. There is a huge seating area in the middle of the gardens with lots of stalls to get snacks, hot lunch and cold drinks including delicious Iced tea cocktails. There is a taxi rank right outside the exit and there was a small queue of available taxis so we did not even have to wait for one when we left the gardens. It is an absolutely beautiful place. We spent around 2 hours strolling around and taking photographs and it was a perfect afternoon. This is a must see whilst visiting Dubai as you will not see anything like it anywhere else.

In pictures the garden looks luxurious however in real life flowers and decor looks cheap such as mdf wood 'photo booth' and random car reckages in between the planting, it looks like a cheap theme park from the 80s. Flowers are also disappointing half were dry or dead, other seems small, they are nearly all in pots.The garden also felt overcrowded with family and children walking over the flower beds being rude and careless. I went with my wife for a romantic evening walk but we both felt shocked and disapointed as we were expecting a beautiful setting, calm and quiet, luxurious and romantic. Finally the road to get there is ridiculously hard to find. It's definitely not worth the money, will never come back."

I'm sure there's lots of work involved, and we did see some gardeners swapping out flower pots which had faded a bit. The arrangements are amazing, and look great on photographs. The park is huge, so yo easily spend a couple of hours just walking around and admiring the different flower arrangements. I do wish though that there were more types of flowers. They basically boil down to petunias for 90%, and then some daisies and snapdragons. When seeing the garden originally from the pictures, I thought there would be a larger variety.Food and drink are fairly limited, especially in quality, but overall the price is worth it."

Gorgeous arches laden with flowers lead you to lush floral arrangements, spilling over from hanging baskets to ground designs and quaint village houses completely covered in flowers. Even Burj Khalifa makes an appearance as a miniature covered in flowers.Good luck discovering months open for the public, best guess is appx Nov to April or May when it closes once it's too hot for flowers to survive outside. It's not an overly large attraction, easy to enjoyably walk the various pathways. It's a perfect uplift as you slowly walking among beautiful displays, with snack refreshments available and seats for resting. Entrance fee is inexpensive, around 30 AED per adult."

There isn't a huge range of flowers used to make up the displays (I guess the heat restricts choice) so if you're going for a horticultural experience you'll be disappointed but the wow factor is there in the displays. The best part - although costs extra - is Butterfly World; an attraction linked to the Gardens. Our 4 year old absolutely loved it!!

Children under 3 yo are free to enter.Behind this Miracle Garden, there is Butterfly Garden. It cost 50 dhs to enter. But, if you have seen variety of butterfly in your country or other place, you can pass this place. It only see the butterfly in few small garden. I've seen much better garden and more vary of butterfly.When we finish with all the gardens, we went out at 6.00 pm. And there were much people than before.So, if you want to take some nice pictures without a lot of people around, just come earlier."

But beyond that the place does not offer much. Eating options are limited and charge over the normal rate. There is not many seating options nor washrooms available.I was disappointed to see that they did not have much variety of flowers in the garden. It is primarily the same type of flower of different colours used everywhere.The location is another issue as the place is hard to reach and out of the way and the worst part is that there aren't proper signs to direct people. Once there the parking scene is dismal and most of the time full.The ticketing counter is not good and getting in is a hassle. Avoid the place in summer as there is no shade and you will burn yourself in the dubai heatThe place is overhyped and even if you skip it, you will not be missing much"

I have not seen so many flowers in one garden anywhere (may be with exception of the Keukenhof Tulips garden near Amsterdam ..). The garden is very huge .... spread over two phases I and II. Both gardens have different flowery themes .... But huge landscapes of thousands of blooming flowers. There is also a unique idea of the a village with flowers on all houses. It takes at least two hours to cover both phases ... and be prepared for the bright/hot sun in desert. I visited in February, wonder how the flowers will survive in summer heat later. The garden is rather away from Dubai Metro route, and I took a taxi from the Mall of Emirates Metro station (10+ miles ride ... but not too expensive).Truly, the Miracle garden ranks amongst the Best Flower gardens in the world."

            "review": "Desert Flowers (millions of them!). Relaxing, cheap, leisurely, but probably not of much interest to teenagers, this most unusual of gardens is awash with colour. It has the Dubai 'wow' factor being the world's biggest flower garden and the Guinness record holder for the Largest Vertical Garden.It claims to have 45 million blooming flowers but you'll have to discover the massive adjacent 'fields' to see the biggest continuous expanse of them. The flowers are displayed in 'stunning designs, awesome shapes and eye-catching colour combinations'.The gardens are situated 'out back' of Dubai near Motor City in the North West Quadrant of the Arabian Ranches interchange along Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road. You may think that being out of the city the roads will be smaller - they're not! You'll need to get there by car, taxi or organised tour.Unfortunately signposting to the gardens is minimal and signposting out of the gardens back to Dubai is virtually non existent. Come on Dubai - you can do better than this!Yes, the gardens are fantastic, but compared to other in-Dubai attractions the infrastructure is, well a bit basic. Everything is there - WCs, Restaurants, glass maze, first aid room, prayer rooms, sitting and playing areas, but it is all a bit, well, basic and uninspiring. Expect vast improvements before Expo 2020. Entry only cost 30Dhs per person, so dirt cheap by Dubai standards and well worth a two to three hour visit. Suggest going early afternoon, then going, without moving your car, to the adjacent Dubai Butterfly Garden and then on, after 4pm to Global Village which is also cheap at 15Dhs. Any bored teenagers will appreciate the fun fair at Global Village and parents will like the various country pavilions. Combine all three places and you'll have a great, varied and cheap day and evening out."

It was an expensive outing and the gardens weren't very impressive. they were more kitschy than anything. If you're in Dubai, go to Safa Park instead.

I had heard about it from friends and read about it in the papers and seen some nice photos. One morning we just decided as a family to go and spend an hour there. After the long hedged road we finally got to the entrance and parked across the road. The price had increased dramatically from what friends had been charged 6 months earlier but we decided it was worth a visit. Once we entered, we soon realized one hour was ambitious. It is a beautiful location and even if flowers don't really interest you, you can't help but enjoy the place. it is a breath of fresh air to be surrounded with the wonderful greenery, the colorful petals and great sculptures they are transformed into when you are in the middle of a dessert.  A lovely place to walk around in the kinder weather. There is lots to see and plenty to photograph. Fun for all the family can be had. Also some nice places to stop and have a refreshing drink or ice cream. We all and fun and look forward to visiting again with the new extension finishing."

Its nice and all - but the arrangements could be better. Some are very in your face and some are indeed beautiful - but the experience is not consistent. They could also do well to manage the heat better. However, it must be said - that growing colors like that in a dessert is a wonder indeed!"

Whoever designed it has had a complete field day - even two rows of upturned cars within a flower bed. The floral architecture is quite stunning and very imaginative - but completely OTT (Over The Top).Intricate watering systems, no keep off the grass signs - but you get whistled at by the \"garden police\" if you stray from the paths. Would go again when there are butterflies to be seen & as an experience it is quite cheap and worthwhile seeing. Our preference though would have been exotic flowers - not exotic structures.Spotlessly clean and not a blade of grass out of place. Lots of places to eat. Go in the early evening when it is cooler."

It is located on the Shk Mohd bin Zayed Road adjoining Dubailand just ahead of Global Village when going towards Abu Dhabi.There are two sections in this garden. One contains the yet unopened Butterfly Garden where there are three deep valley like flower arrangements. This section is smaller to cover and at most take your 30-45 mins.The other bigger section is the extensive one where a whole lot of craft with different varieties of flower has been created which will amuse people from any age group. Be it a train or car or a monument you name it and they have made it out flower. There are food outlets serving interesting tits and bits from Asian cuisine.It is open during the winter months only and can be visited in day or night since in the night the lighting has been well designed to keep the shutterbugs happy.Yes that's one thing you shouldn't forget your Camera since you will get many a flower things to Capture.A complete detailed coverage of both the sections will consume on an average 3-4 hours on how you plan it.The admission fee is worth it aptly priced at AED 30.Not an attraction to miss when in Dubai during winters."

I guess there are limited flora that can thrive in the area. It's good that they keep improving the area by adding more structures. Overall, it is a perfect place for picture taking."

There were no information about what flowers were in the gardens, and not knowing much about flowers, they all looked the same walking through the garden. I would suggest a brochure to take in to let you know what flowers you are looking at, or placing the flower names around the garden. Would probably not be coming back or bringing visitors there."

For expats here in Dubai, maybe a few random visits is nice for relaxation after weeks of hard work. For tourists, in my opinion, it's NOT really a must-visit. Though, it's a very clean park and perfect for family, group of friends, couples and kids.When you get there, you have to pay an entrance fee of AED 30/person. You will be welcomed with lots of flowers either nicely planted on the ground, around a car, or formed into huge heart arch, peacock tail, houses, so and so. A buggy is available for old people or anyone who wish to go around the park without walking.You can take photos, however, you CANNOT touch, get near or lie down on a bed of flowers because if you do so the security will blow their whistle at you. Everywhere, there's a security manning the flowers and structures to ensure that no one gets near. Miracle Garden is a park where it's legal to see and smell the flowers, but illegal to touch them.Miracle Garden exhibits different kinds of flowers. However, if you're not good on flora and fauna, you'll never know what kind of flowers are there. There are no labels or signs that mention a brief information about the flowers. I hope the park will consider putting 'info' labels about the flowers for educational purposes (this will also be a big help to those schools who are taking their educational trip at the park).Other than the flower sighting, of course, you can go for a stroll around the park or grab some snacks from the cafes, food cart and food court. Food is quite pricey. Two pomegranate juice and two cheese-beef fatayer costed us 140 AED from Egyption Fatayer (and the beef filling in the fatayer isn't real beef; it's corned beef from a can).It may be more favourable to visit by late afternoon until evening as the daytime temperature may be too humid. Do note also that Miracle Garden is only open to public on winter season (imagine what happens to those flowers during Dubai summer with above 40C temperature...).Toilets for men and women are available, and they're well maintained. And if I can remember it right, there are also prayer rooms for Muslims.Transportation to Miracle Garden: if you're not driving or doesn't know the right exit roads, take the Metro line going to Mall of the Emirates (MOE) metro station. This is the nearest metro station to Miracle Garden. From the MOE metro station, go down to the bus terminal and take F30 bus. Tell the bus driver to drop you at Studio City bus stop (from MOE to Studio City, it may take 30 to 45 minutes ride). When you off load to Studio City bus stop, take a cab to the Miracle Garden (5-10 minutes ride). There are cabs at Miracle Garden which you can take going back to the bus stop or metro station.There are NO ATM machine, souvenir shops, grocery stores or pharmacy near or at Miracle Garden. For your info.If you're a first-time tourist in Dubai, my suggestion is don't make this place a priority on your list. You won't feel bad anyways if you missed to see it."

With the Dubai Miracle Garden, they really made a miracle growing millions of flowers in this area!!! Kudos to those green hands!What I really don't like though in this 'newest Dubai tourist site' is the SMELL, maybe it is because of the fertilizer they've put on those plants/flowers."

I have been to so many places but this Garden is the most stylish. They had structures of house, castles, boats, exquite structures made from flowers. It look amazing. Each structure was hollow and had flower pots planted such a way that you dont understand until u keenly observe it. I would say you need 4 hrs minimum if you want to enjoy the place and take pictures. When spoke with a guard, he told me every year this garden comes up with different styling and concepts of flower decorations. So each year is new design. Highly recommended."

A few car/truck exhibits for the children to enjoy and plenty of space for walking. Places to get snacks and drinks. Getting to the main entrance once you leave the highway (sign with Miracle Garden) is a maze itself (look for small red/blue signs at roundabouts). Taxi drivers can find this if you don't have a car.

Located almost in front of Arabian Ranches and on the side of Emirates Road, The Miracle Garden its a mix of recycle items from failed Dubailand projects with an ocean of flowers. Its not an easy place to find, specially with all the construction around so you need a lot of patience and a proper map to find this place. The best way to access it, is to take the Mall of the Emirates exit (Umm Suqeim Road), pass below Al Khail Road and take the exit after Dubio Tech (just 2 exits before Emirates Road). After that, just follow the signs.The Garden has 4 different entrances and the entrance fee is not expensive (30dhs = less than 10 USD). The garden itself its very nice. It has hundreds of different floral arrangements around houses, old cars, monuments and halls. Its not a massive place but everything its very organized (something rare in Dubai). There is a strict policy of no standing on the grass so please follow to maintain the garden integrity. Now a days, its a very popular place and it gets crowded, specially in the afternoon, so try to be early to take really nice pictures. Its a nice place to spend a few hours. The only thing missing its a nice cafe place to sit and enjoy the views."

The gardens are a striking display of color \u2013 laid out in flower beds, hanging baskets, and on various installations (cars, houses, mock-skyscrapers, etc.). It is highly manicured, but not in the style of an English flower garden or Japanese garden. Nothing is labeled as it would be in a botanical garden. It\u2019s strictly designed to astound and surprise \u2013 very, very Dubai in approach. It\u2019s striking and beautiful but feels very out of place in what would naturally be a desert. I couldn\u2019t help but be shocked at the blatant environmental unsustainability of it all.

Open in the winter period - around Oct to March, this is a must see for not just tourists but the residents as well. A bit tricky to reach as except taxis or your own car not much local transportation possible. It lies between Sheikh Zayed road and Al Khail road.They have recently opened a second garden but one ticket has tearaways that will be taken by the usher at the gates of either. Both are must sees as have something different for us to gaze and wonder.Beautiful landscaping using lovely vibrant flowers...dummy animals, cars, houses, bridge archways, clocks...all get the makeover with flowers brilliantly laid out. A beautiful valley of flowers is simply awesome when entering through an arcade tunnel. Simply brilliant for 3-4 hours with family. Not much eating options so sneak in some of your own if planning more than 1-2 hours."

It took us about 40 minutes by taxi with no traffic to access the garden. A long ride but definitely worth it if you have time to discover the rest of the city. We spent almost two and a half hours in this beautiful garden. You can see the effort those architects has put to turn this place into something imaginable. The landscapes are fully covered with flowers. There is what I assumed as Burj Khalifa, the Eiffel Tower, and windmills representing Holland all well-built and designed carefully with flowers. It captures your attention how things have been organised to come out with a perfect picture of the place. Note that the garden is only opened in the months in which the plants can handle the heat. So it is your chance to walk while enjoying cold breezes here and there. You can rest at the shaded areas and have a refreshing drink. However, I recommend that you buy yourself snacks from a supermarket or something before you go as the snacks that are sold in the graden are more expensive. Not surprising for a tourist attraction, but if you're going with kids and is on a tight budget it may be useful to consider this."

I went on their website and it stated that phase 1&2 were open to the public with plenty of photographs on show. My daughter and I took a taxi there as there is no public transport available in the area. When we got there it seemed awfully quite. I got a sinking feeling that something was amiss. I looked around and the entrance gate was locked. I found a security guard who was walking around and asked him why the gate was closed. He replied that the gardens were not open to the public as yet. I thought that he must be confused and I told him that the website states that the gardens were open and visitors are welcome. He just shook his head and gave me a pitying look. I got so upset as by this stage the taxi had gone and there was no other in site to leave the so called Miracle Garden. An American gentleman who saw us and realized what had happened offered to share his taxi with us which was a saving grace as otherwise we would have been stuck in the middle of the desert in the heat. This is unacceptable behavior on the part of the people who run this attraction. Why advertise that the Garden was open when it was clearly not? Please check with a reputable source before you visit this place just in case."

There are golf carts for you to ride in for a fee if you don't want to walk. There is a small play area for the young children 20 DHS for 15 minutes. It can be difficult to find so you will a sat-nav, but there plenty of parking and the staff are helpful. There are houses from all over the world covered in flowers, the Paris Eiffel Tower, Dutch windmills, Burj Khalifa all covered with flowers, beautiful. 30 DHS entrance fee very busy at weekends obviously but well worth a visit.

I am not a flower fan, neither I know what kind of flowers are there, but I was impressed with what they made, built and decorated with flowers.The Miracle garden is on the outskirts of Dubai, towards the desert, and I drove some 20 minutes up to there. There is no metro or bus, so you must drive or take a taxi. If driving, you'll get lost like I did, because no signs, so you must frequently ask other drivers on signals.The entrance is 30 Dirham pp (7 Eur, including children) and it was quite busy with a lot of people. I recommend coming around sunset to avoid the heat, and to see it lit up at night. Allow up to 2 hours for visit, nice for eyes and nose."

It is advisable to come very early or late since the heat can be very scorching at noon, it will very uncomfortable and surely one can get sunburn. The garden is a nice backdrop for \"selfies\" and photo. One can choose from the different arrangement of flowers. If one is expecting different kind of flowers, one will be disappointed since this garden is more on landscaping than the showcasing of different types of flowers and plants. Another important thing to take note is that miracle garden will close during summer."

The place is worth 100% seeing and enjoying, but be aware that except for a few terraces also covered with flowers and providing shadow, while walking on the alleys, there is almost no shadow, so if you plan to visit when the temperatures are rising, maybe it's better to go in the evening.

And so me and my mum went there around 4-5pm. It was totally packed with tourists! It gets a little weird taking photos since many people pass by and are just walking all over the place. You'll definitely have another guy in your selfie! Nevertheless, I personally think that it's much more enjoyable if there are a lot of people. So, if you prefer this, visit during weekends. But another reminder is the medium-heavy flow of traffic and the parking space, so you better keep these in mind.As for the place itself, it was definitely amazing. Having such beautiful and colorful flowers arranged to such delightful forms and designs is great itself, but having to see it in a dry and hot place such as Dubai is in fact a miracle. A lot of sights to see, fun and exciting, great for the kids and definitely a must for couples!Not quite sure if outside food and drinks are allowed, but there are a couple of stalls inside where you can buy from but I bet the price is way higher (also not sure about the quality). Wear comfortable shoes and warm clothing! It gets pretty cold especially when visiting at night and the place is huge so you better kick those heels off.I would also suggest that you go earlier in order for you to really see and appreciate the surroundings since the lighting's not that good and also if you're there to take good quality photos.There are also a couple places where you cannot step on and take photos on, you'll know where. A lot of the guards there will just tell you to get off hahahaFor 30AED/person, you could enjoy and walk around the Miracle Garden. Have fun!"

But seriously, it's a lively place for a nice photo, and a mist pleasant way to kill a couple of hours. All in all, it was lovely and my children loved it! It's a bit out of the way, so if possible, keep a car with you when you go. Or arrange return transportation before you get there."

A beautiful morning spent in the garden. 1. ensure that the gardens are open at the time of your visit as flowers are seasonal2. contact the garden management before your trip or check their facebook page to ensure they are not under renovation. Was difficult to get them on the phone / reply.Our hotel did not have the correct information so ended up wasting a day doing something else.should be open in December as it is tourist season and winter in Dubai. 3. ticket is 30 AED. worth it. 4. there is a maze inside the garden for additional charge, seemed like fun if there is time.5. one can hire the golf cart for 20 AED to take your group around the park -with 5-7stops of 1 min each for photos. we walked as it is not a huge park.6. ensure you take sun umbrellas/ sun glasses or hats. The sun is quite strong.7. snacks available at the back section of the garden - Egyptian pancakes, potato on a stick, waffles, smoothies. all upto 20 AED. Great few hours away from the malls"

It is possible to take a taxi from the stop before, FGB, which is a shorter taxi ride. On the way back we took a taxi to the FGB stop, however it cost us 50aed. the driver has to make a long u turn. We did not take an official taxi on the way back, but on checking the taxi calculator, this was the correct price. The actual Miricale garden was nice, it had lots of quirky arrangements and was very colourful. It was quite a peaceful place and only took about 40 minutes to see the whole place which was enough for us anyway. We were advised that the food options were not great so we ate before we went, but it might be a nice place for a picnic if you like that sort of thing."

Taxis are easily available to and from the place. Children below 3 yrs and people on wheelchair enter free. For the others there is an entrance fee. The garden is pretty spectacular - although not the best I have seen. They have currently developed only phase I of the garden and phase II is under development. Its definitely a place worth visiting. Will take you about 2 hours to see the whole garden leisurely. There are buggys available to take you around too but the garden can easily be covered by foot. You can take some nice pictures here...Its very colorful and very pleasant. We visited it during the day time and it was not very crowded."

Wear sunglasses because there is not much shade in the garden.Conclusion- worth a visit! i will visit again once the dome is done, i hope they will have all sorts of roses!Personal Thoughts:The garden is lovely but it is more like all colors and shapes but not much peaceful feel into it, i prefer english gardens. And i am sort of disappointed because they dont have roses at all during my visit, not sure if they have it seasonally or just dont grow them at all, but considering they will have a closed dome garden in the future, they may grow them there. sunflowers, and stargazers would be nice too."

Although there is so much construction work being done, before long the gardens will not seem so far out of town. As soon as you go through the gate you see the beautiful colours from the thousands of plants. They are not just planted in beds and hanging baskets but also in some very quirky containers such as old cars, bikes, cottages and various three dimensional shapes.We went in the morning and had the place almost to ourselves. That would imagine that was because of the heat. The evening is supposed to be the best time to visit but then the garden will be more crowded.Be aware that if you go through the day it will get very hot and there is very little shade.

You can take a bus from the garden to MOE or wait for Dubai taxi.4.) Bring your own food. They have limited food options at the Garden cafeteria."

Entrance and car park looks unloved and uninviting. 30dhs entrance per adult, worth the money?"

However, in May when I visited, the flowers were all a bit tired looking and a bit sparse in some areas. I'm not a horticulturalist but it seems it could be better maintained. Also, the website is rubbish. It doesn't even show the map of phase II and most pictures are rendered drawings. Signage from the road leading to it is also too late and you need to cut across 6 lanes of traffic to exit if you don't happen to be in the right lane.There are some food kiosks to buy snacks and lots of seating areas to sit and enjoy. Go later in the day when it's not so hot.It's not bad and nice for a walk and be around nature."

It is in rather secluded place and if opting for public transport, we need to avail taxi from Mall of Emirates on First Gulf Bank metro station. The journey might cost you around 30 Dirhams. Entry fee is 30 Dirham when phase II has started. Earlier it was only 20AED when only Phase I was open for public. You enter into a sea of flowers, taking all possible and renowned shapes. Try to be there in the latter half of the day, to avoid heat and also on weekdays, if you love to be clicked pretty often. You might not be tired of seeing flowers and shapes, again and again and you can easily spend around 1-2 hours. They have eating joints available, slightly heavy-priced but overall it can be a great day\u2019s outing to be here."

For those that have lived here a long time, it's where the failed project \"DubaiLand\" was supposed to go. For Visitors, it's on Umm Sequiem Road was behind the Mall of the Emirates. Once you pass Al Khail Road look for the signs. Now, once you get moving on the road towards the garden you will reach a gate, and there's a sign for Valet Parking for 50 AED, and a small parking with a sign for 30 AED. DO NOT BE FOOLED. These are not your only two options. Keep driving and you will come another big parking lot that is free, and a second entrance. Don't throw your money away on the first entrance. The gate fee is now 30 AED per person as Phase II is now open. We went in mid-March, so the weather was great. I'm not sure how pleasant it will be in the blistering summer temperatures Dubai is known for. There was plenty to see and tons of photo ops. Being a week-day it was not too crowded. Phase I is basically a large ring with tons of different arrangements, old cars, and various metal designs covered with flowers. The theme from Titanic played on repeat the whole time we were there. Strange music choice for a flower exhibit. The skeleton of the old entrance to DubaiLand still remains off in the distance. It's pretty dilapidated, but can be cropped out of most photos. The security guards were friendly and helpful and would take your photo if asked. Getting to Phase II is a bit of a walk, and across a small street. Phase II seems to be smaller for now and was basically 3 huge pits covered in flowers. There was a small walkway down to bottom of each pit with rails etc... It took us about two hours to g through it all. Make sure you have good walking shoes and are well hydrated. There are a few places that sell food and drink along the way."

The flower has many unique designs and is a perfect place to spend your afternoon especially during the so called winter in the UAE. However, some may not find it very different, especially Europeans, because the flower is composed of only 2 to 3 types of flowers. Thus, the variety in flowers is missing and this is mainly because not many flowers can withstand the weather in the UAE. So I do consider it a miracle in the UAE.

            "review": "Paradise on Earth!. On my recent visit to Dubai I visited Miracle Garden just after Valentine's day and was awe-struck at the imaginative way in which the colourful flowers were displayed through out. The garden is divided into 2 areas and though Phase 1 is better established, Phase 2 is expected to be a spectacular display as well when fully opened. Phase 1 mainly includes flower huts, flower falls, flower archways, flower hearts pathway, umbrella pathway, flower lamps and flower boats. Some of the more remarkable structures are the three peacocks at the entrance, two of which have opened tails and one has a closed tail. The Burj Khalifa replica in the middle of the garden made with colourful flowers is stunning. The Cars zone and the Animals zone is also very interesting and a great place to pose for photos. The seven flower pyramids add to the beauty of the garden. The Falcon is a very imposing structure at the back.Phase 2 is a 3 minute walk from the Phase 1 and includes the brilliant round shaped butterfly garden in 3D and decorated with flowers. The aromatic plants garden and edible plants garden are still being established in Phase 2.The entrance fees to the Phase 1 is 20 dirhams and to Phase 2 is 10 dirhams. Opening times are from 9 am to 9pm on weekdays are I believe longer on weekends. Parking is not a problem as there are both paid and free car parks. Lots of cafes and ice cream shops inside the gardens and plenty of shade to sit and enjoy the riot of colours! The mid day sun can get unbearable and the park provides a buggy for elderly visitors or families with young children(which can cost 10 dirhams for 3-4 passengers) and takes one around the park with two stops to jump off and take quick photos. This service can be requested when purchasing tickets at the gate. All in all a great day out and highly recommended for parties or weddings!"

The only pests there were the loud ppl who think their culture allows them to sPeak obnoxiously loud.I would recommend it to all guests (easy to find), can take you max 45 minutes (walking, pics, talking). Things missing: flower variety, proper staff without annoying whistles, litter cans, water fountains, signs (with instructions \"stay off grass\" or \"type of flower\") - could be closed in the \"summer\", look out for that.

We were promised that the Miracle Gardens would be reopened during our October visit to Dubai but they remained firmly closed so day 3 of this Spring trip we made for it. It is extraordinary. We love Botanical Gardens world wide. This is not what Miracle Gardens offers. It offers colours, fragrance, shapes, water, and creativity. Peacock birds in many colours, cars, boats, animals, buildings, all in various different flowers, and colours. Yes the \"security\" guards blowing their whistles mindlessly whenever a child go near the UAE flag exhibition (just put some signs saying keep off) should be returned to the unemployment pool in Dubai; but the cafes and children's play areas are pleasantly staffed. What a place for a wedding!"

Somehow I think plants lose something when they're displayed in such an unnatural setting.What I found really strange, and was a testament to the artificiality of it all, was the almost complete lack of insect life. If you had that many flowers in Europe, it would be alive with bees and butterflies. But not here. I saw just a couple of insects (something a bit like a hoverfly, but I'm not sure exactly what it was) on one of the beds, and a lone ant on one of the paths, but that was it for insect life. Not a single bee or butterfly anywhere to be seen.Very strange."

There were a few cafes on one side of the garden where they sold drinks and something to eat. We experienced it as a quiet, good-smelling, and nice place to walk around and relax. At some places there were benches, but very few ones in the shade, so we would suggest to bring a hat or something to protect you from sunburn.

Cars made into giant flower pots, flower peacock, flower houses and many others. I think this was rather a quite romantic place especially with the heart shaped tunnel, of course, made with flowers! Better think well of the weather before going there. There were not much shades if you think you can't bear with the sun. We went there at around 4 pm in the afternoon, it was not that hot and the wind was cool."

I was worried that when the wife and my 2 boys went they would be disappointed. This was so far from the truth. They adored it. Firstly you have to go with an open mind by remembering just where in the world you are. Its a deserts. What's been achieved is indeed amazing all things considered. And the vision to do it is typical of Dubai and the approach to everything where nothing is impossible. The only thing she wanted was for it to be bigger. I believe there are plans as we speak to do just that. The photos we have are fantastic. Shame you cant smell them. If you love gardens and flowers and understand the work and care required to achieve it you will adore this place. If your a person who dwells in the city and have never done any gardening you will still enjoy it. Lovely place to sit and read a book. I only ask, as I do of many public arenas, that more areas were set aside to sit and have a picnic amongst it and just savour the day. But I am bias as i do love a family picnic :-)"

Very crowded and the constant sound of the security guards blowing their whistles at the visitors who got to close to the display, made it a less than calming experience. You need a car. If like us, who caught a taxi. Trying to catch a taxi back was chaos. There was no taxi rank, so it was a crazy scramble to get the few taxis available back. After waiting 2 hours, with no success we headed back to the motorway and after a15 minute wait managed to flag a taxi down.

But having seen the flower festivals and gardens in other countries, I was disappointed. The garden is a miracle because it exists in the middle of desert, agree. For someone, who is less traveled, or always lived in an economically depressed or hot desert region, the colors and the sheer number of blooming flowers is probably overwhelming. But flower arrangements are made out of simplest petunias in different color arrangements, and the entire garden can be covered in 20 minutes (or 30 if you pause at a cafe and eat ice cream). The entrance fee of 20 AED is a very much reasonable (about 6 USD), but the entire experience was a letdown. Honestly, you get more flower choices and color variety at Schiphol Duty Free stores."

It was a letdown. 80% of the flowers are just Petunias in different colors/arrangements. We were out in 15 minutes flat.When we drove in, the cars were stopped by a valet in a vest. He asked me to lower my car window and informed me 'Dh.50 parking to the left and Dh.30 parking to the right'. Not seeing ,much difference between them, i opted for the Dh.30 parking. Once inside, I noticed people entering from another gate and upon enquiry found out that there was a free parking.When I was returning to my car, I stopped the valet who had guided me and asked him why he spoke the incomplete truth, that there was a free parking ahead. He had the gall to tell me 'because you did not ask for the free parking'. This in my dictionary is a classic CON!"

I particularly loved the houses made of flowers. It is easy to walk around - allow approx. 2 hours for the visit to see it at your leisure and perhaps a short break for a drink. If you can it is probably better to visit either early or later in the day as there is very little shade from the sun apart from the small caf\u00e9 where you can get a drink or light refreshments.

They are situated at Al Barsha South so a quite a lengthy taxi ride from the centre of Dubai. There is also a bus (no 30) which runs from the Emirates Mall on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. We took a taxi with a very helpful and friendly driver who agreed to come and pick us up at a specified time. As taxi prices are reasonably cheap in Dubai this was our preferred method (about \u00a310 each way).These gardens are definitely worth a visit and are only open during the winter and spring months - not sure when it finally becomes too hot for them. and this was their first year of opening. They consist of huge areas of bedding plants in bright colours \u2013 mainly petunias and pelargoniums but not just in flat beds \u2013 they cover pyramids, archways and even cars. We wandered around happily for over 2 hours, just glad we had put sunscreen on. There are a few shady places to sit and enjoy an icecream or a cold drink but most of the gardens are in full sun.We thoroughly enjoyed our visit though if you prefer quiet eco-friendly natural gardens they are probably not for you as they definitely come into the bold and bright category."

Enough to keep you clicking away in all directions for hours. This right in the middle of the hot desert and nothing for miles around by way of trees . I wish they had a way of keeping this park open through out the year even if it meant a few million flowers or a few dozen colours less. I liked the way the plants were watered. Recycled sewage water, it appeared , from the smell that wafted across occasionally but the drip lines were cleverly hidden in the scaffolding and potting mix. And speaking of pots (melting pots that is) , the diversity of the visitors themselves lend a colour to the Garden- Arabs, Indians, Philipinos, Europeans, Chinese\u2026."

I have not seen such wonderful and miraculous collection of flowers in my life why I can say in anybody's life. I was just spell bound to see so many varieties of flowers I ever seen in my life.The visitors cant believe their own eyes and went near and touch them to see whether they real that type unimaginable collection never seen before of flower collections were there for view.Elders and children alike enjoy the rare collection and took photographs as memorable event.Available and suitable at winter seasonsI must visit olace for any vistor and residents of Bubai and UAE."

There is not much shade, although there are tents provided with seats and refreshments are sold. The website has posted the following notice, AnnouncementDubai Miracle Garden will be closed on Wednesday (May 01, 2013) in preparation for the next season. A big surprise awaits you in the next season..... Please follow our page on facebook and visit DMG website for the updates and opening date. The entrance fee is 20 AED for adults. I took a metro to Mall of Emirates, then took bus #F30 from bus station outside MOE, direct to Miracle Garden, which is beside Dubailand. The bus runs every 25 minutes from 2pm to 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays only. The bus journey back to MOE was long though as it went to Arabian Ranches. As other people have mentioned there was a lot of whistle blowing due to people getting too close to the flowers. Over all I had a good experience and enjoyed my relaxing trip to Dubai Miracle Garden."

Due to close soon as apparently they will be putting on a roof according to the taxi driver, so def include it on your list if you are visiting Dubai soon."

A big colourful garden in the middle of a desert is a treat to the eyes....this place is literally in the middle of desert with no metro or bus access...you have to either take a taxi or drive a car to reach here.There are flower pyramids, flower dome, flowers on cars, flower peacocks and rows of colorful flowers on the ground.....in comparison to Switzerland or India during the spring time, this is just a little place but for those staying in a desert, this is definitely a miracle.Kids and adults will equally enjoy this place."

There is little to no shade available and you get a sharp whistle blast from the multiple regents if you sit down on the grass. My five-year old niece was pretty exhausted after an hour or so of walking through (she went looking for fairies). There are plenty of bathroom facilities available, but no sources of water unless you want to wait in line at the informal concession stands. Separate (gender) prayer tents are there, but they are sweltering in the direct sunlight. I really wished these guys installed misters and water fountains here. If you want to go, go during the evening. But it's pretty!"

I heard that there is a garden in Al Ain but we could not go there. When we visited the place there was a sand storm also. Some how we managed the climate and we took many photographs from there. There were many domes, peacock designed with flowers and plants, there was an emirates logo with flowers. You can find area ceiling made with small umbrellas. A negative thing I wish to tell you that the lack of enough clock room facilities. Especially in ladies side there was a big queue for using toilet facility. Being a garden the children cannot find anything for them and walking hours to see the garden made them tired. The management can have something there to make the children happy."

            "review": "A little over-hyped at this point but pretty. I was very excited about seeing this knowing that Dubai does everything in an over-the-top fashion but, although this is pretty, this attraction probably needs another year or two to get my \"miracle\" rating! It's out of the way (unless you're going to an amusement park called Dubai Land which it's next door to), there isn't any shade and the sun can be merciless, the \"garden\" is basically all petunias and there are nasty whistle blowing guards all over the place! I see one reviewer says it's a good place for a family picnic but I can't imagine that would be permitted and you would all melt anyway! It's also about $20USD per adult. We took the metro to the Mall of the Emirates then caught a cab so it was a bit of a hassle and fairly expensive to get there and back. Having said all of these snarky things it IS a very pretty place and it's nice to admire something other than architecture or shopping centers in Dubai. But if you've been to beautiful gardens, maybe the Singapore Botanic Garden, this will be a disappointment unless you're a major petunia lover. If you do go do so as early or as late in the day as you can. We were there mid-day and the heat was oppressive and the little food tents set up along the perimeter had all run out of water and only had juice to sell. They have plans to do much more and I suspect it will be lovely, if not a \"miracle\" in a couple years, but right now I'd probably skip it. I have a travel blog and wrote a post about our (rather funny) visit there. If you'd like to read it it's at http://bit.ly/YFUn6M."

We spent about an hour walking the grounds of the Miracle Garden and worth the about $5 entrance fee. The flowers are done well and some excellent shot with the camera. You are free to roam about and it was just a very pleasant time. I would go in the morning as I could see it getting pretty hot there and shade is available, but limited.There is food and water on site, but it is remote with a lot of taxi drivers not knowing where this place is as it is still pretty new. The place was busy, but that was because people drove themselves there. We just got the taxi out as they were dropping someone off, so keep that in mind. We might have been lucky."

Dubai is a miracle city in itself, and when Dubai calls something a Miracle, it really sets the expectations v high.It was valentine's day and I decided to surprise my wife by taking her to this place; 1, Coz its so-called Miracle, and 2, my wife loves flowers. By d way, she is v knowledgeable about flowers. Guess what! surprise had a price which I had to pay later for spoiling the party (secret).1. There are v less and ugly species of flowers in this place.2. When you think of a Miracle garden, it cannot be without roses, jasmines and more importantly that fragrance and soothing feel to your eyes. None could be found here.3. Parking arrangements are not too good for the big crowd attracted to the place due to media hype4. Access to the location is v complicated with v limited sign boards5. If you like photography, then mind you the place is poorly lit6. And last but not the least, the place is not worth even small entrance of 20 bucks per person as you feel sorry after spending it there instead of so many worthwhile things in Dubai.7. Tourists particularly, beware! This place is for those who have seen sand throughout their lives, and never saw a flower. At least back in my home country, I have seen a lot of greenery and colorful flowers much better than the best in MIRACLE GARDEN.I wont be surprised if in coming days Miracle Garden would turn into ruins..."

It has lots of flowers and fairly large (not by dubai standards), however in name of varity its just different colors of same breed. You will barely find a second varity of flower. The watering of the moss on which flowers are growing has incresed humidity of the park very much and walking is big effort. At spots moss is rotting and smell is very bad.And top of it ticket costs AED 20 per head a steep for family."

A wonderful thought from the creators and all the staff who maintain is much appreciated by all. The shades and hues of the flowers present well for some photography. This is a seasonal attraction only during the spring perhaps. A must visit place far from the commercially focused malls in Dubai for both visitors and residents alike. In fact I have visited the flower show at the Bangalore Lal Bagh several times and the annual flower event in Ooty and Coonoor in India once as well. I find the Dubai Miracle Garden comparable or even better given the fact that only a few species can grow in these harsh weathers were fertile soil and water is a constraint. This is such a real example of 'if there is a will, there is a way'I bow to the HH, The Ruler of Dubai who has such a vision and wonderful heart that is reflected in the unimaginable multitude of colors from mother nature. You ought to see it and experience."

Even in the scorching heat of the desert petunias were as fragrant as is if there was no heat at all. They have different sculptures, and arrangements of flowers so its not same old rows of pretty flowers. It takes about an hour, to walk through the whole garden. It is an eye pleasing place for sure, and if you worry for your kids getting bored hit Dubai land next door, you can even walk there!So two rabbits in one shot"

Really is a miracle to see the different colored flowers spread out in the middle of a desert. Most of the \u00a0flowers seemed to be wilting and dying so I'm \u00a0not sure how long the flowers would survive going into the summer. That really would be the miracle, trying to keep it alive. But do visit during the daytime on weekdays when you can avoid the crowds and get better photos, if you are into that sort of thing."
