It is easily to get to by a No 5 bus or by MRT. The Buddhist nuns are a silent order and can be seen working in the gardens. There is a large pond with a large school of koi or (Oscar) fish. allow at least 3hr for the visit so you an sit on the benches and ease your mind and body. The temple has larger religious buddas and there are people praying in front of most of the altars.There is no entry fee but a donation box is available and the gift shop is well worth a visit."

It is the world largest hand-made wooden building without a single nail. It is in Tang dynasty style (AD 618\u2013907) and therefore resembles the look of Japanese shrines (main period of cultural influence to Japan\uff09which many travellers familar with .

We had several plans for the day but the gardens at the Chi Lin Nunnery were so fantastic that we scrapped our list of plans and spent the day there! To get to the nunnery we had to walk through the Nan Lian garden -- a large traditional Chinese garden that is managed by the nunnery. What a surprise! We didn\u2019t know there would be a garden and it was the most beautiful garden either one of us had ever seen. And we\u2019ve been to England and other places to see gardens. It was magical seeing it in the rain and with not many people around. The bonsaied pines and other bonsaied trees, the many beautiful and strategically placed large rocks and pieces of petrified wood, the ponds, bridges, water wheels and traditional-style buildings, the many different types of trees with interesting bark and foliage including banyans, plus a variety shrubs and ground covers made for a calm and peaceful day right in the middle of Hong Kong city!! The garden also had some beautiful exhibits in traditional styled buildings including a showing of Marino glass pieces, bonsaied small trees, petrified woods, and an exhibit on how the nunnery was made without nails. It also had a restaurant plus a teahouse where we had tea (with assistance in the traditional way) and a light snack. It was a highlight of our trip to Honk Kong \u2013 it was truly stunning. We think the best to enter the gardens is by taking the metro to Diamond Hill."

Soft music plays throughout the gardens and skyscrapers tower in the background which provides a very interesting visual contrast. Make sure to enter the large building in the back of the lotus pond courtyard; it's not posted and the guards won't direct you. This contains huge gold statues that are amazing and are some of the prettiest we saw during our trip. Sadly, no photos are allowed."

The nunnery is an easy walk from the Diamond Hill station and well signposted. The Hong Kong Metro is clean, cool, and safe, and although Diamond Hill looks like quite a long trip it was really quite fast.  A guard at the entrance to the main garden area was full of really interesting facts and spoke English quite well, so that was an added benefit. There's a small tea room, but when we arrived the main restaurant had already closed. It looked like a lovely spot for a casual lunch, whereas the tea room was rather basic. A special oasis that feels so far away from the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong and Kowloon!"

The Nan Lian gardens are worth checking out first, but once you are finished there step over the bridge to the large timber temple complex across the road. The outer courtyard is stunning, with small pools neatly organised around the garden and shaded cloisters around the edge if the sun is too overbearing. A large golden Buddha overlooks the square from the far end behind a wall of glass; photos are permitted of the courtyards but not of the interior rooms or statues. There are plenty of photo opportunities for the courtyards, but taking them from the side aisles may prove too dark for anything to be visible. The inner courtyard is smaller and lacks the pools of the first, but is just as serene. At the end of the walk, one will find the altar room of a giant golden Buddha enthroned and surrounded by four Boddhisvatas in statue form. It is a breathtaking sight, and a rather unique one as well. The main chamber was rather hot because it is not air conditioned; curiously they had several fans on, all facing Buddha rather than the viewing gallery. I am not sure why they thought Buddha might need to cool down; after all, he is only a statue.Security guards patrol the public areas, but aside from that any kind of administrative presence is non-existent and overall the entire place feels entirely free of westernisation or commercialisation. It is a tourist site, but not your typical attraction that is just there to get people through its doors spending money. Perhaps that is what makes it so peaceful."

This review is from our four week trip to Asia.Chi Lin Buddhist nunnery is easily reached via the MTR, Hong Kong\u2019s underground train system. The MTR is very easy to use and incredibly efficient; select your destination by touching it on the map of the ticket machine, select how many tickets you want and then feed in the required amount of money. The machine will then spit out your tickets. The train lines are color coded so it\u2019s easy to follow the signs in the station to your desired platform. The nunnery is famous for being constructed entirely from wood with no nails or other types of fasteners. Entry to the nunnery and the adjoining gardens is free and access to the temple halls is open to all, though no pictures are allowed to be taken in the actual prayer halls. There are 4 main halls that surround a series of lily ponds; though only constructed in 1997 the place has an ancient feel to it and is still very much an active facility. The adjoining Nan Lian Gardens are simply stunning; every tree, flower and shrub appear to have been precisely positioned around a central lake and each is perfectly pruned to create a wonderful experience. A large pagoda sits on an island in the center of the lake and a pair of brightly colored bridges connects the lake to the surrounding gardens. We followed a sweeping path for a peaceful stroll around the lake where we found a beautiful waterfall and further on a small teashop run by the nuns."

The place was funded by some Hong Kong very famous celebrities, and the 'theme' is buddha (but not a temple). This 'park' was built, following the buildings of the ancient Chinese 'Tong' Dynasty. There is one vegetarian restaurant and also a Chinese tea house (both open day time only). I highly recommend the vegetarian restaurant.The place is close to the MTR station (Diamond Hill) and after your visit, you may consider to visit Hong Kong's most iconic temple in Wong Tai Sin, just one more MTR station. However, Chi Lin has very straight rules - quiet (not a children friendly place), no blocking (don't bring your camera stand) and they do not even allow you to read newspaper (not my concern). But I think it's a great way in enjoying a quiet atmosphere. BTW, even an European princess came to Hong Kong, she personally asked to come here for a visit."

When you look closely you can see people sitting inside the restaurant which is hidden amongst the trees. It is the Chi Lin vegan restaurant. We decided to have lunch and we were lucky enough to sit behind the waterfall. Truely magical. We ordered the lunch special as we didn't quite understand what we were eating.

Having been there on a few ocassions apart from the cable car ride I cannot think of another reason for going there. This is however a review about Chi Lin Nunnery, a place well worth going to.The nunnery has a very interesing Buddhist temple with great statues set inside some fantastic old buildings. The traditional archetecture is very interesting and full of character. The gardens are large and well kept with many different types of features. These include water features including a working water wheel, fountains and ponds.The vegetarian restaurant set in the grounds serves excellent food. I went there for the afternoon tea set and was surprised. The sweet platter I choose had a great taste and the cheesecake was one of the best I have had in a long time and certainly one of the best I have had in this part of the world.Overall, I would now try to make it a point to go to this complex everytime I visit Hong Kong and I would strongly suggest anyone visiting to also come here."

But we were nearby anyway, so we did. It was lovely! An oasis in a metropolis. The attached Nan Lian gardens where immaculate but still organic and friendly. But the monastery is really quite something from another era. It was actually built in the 1990's but could have been built a thousand years ago. They used construction techniques and materials contemporary with temple construction from up to a thousand years ago, as showcased in the gardens. The grand scope, yet attention to detail in all the fountains is amazing! Not a screw in the entire place and apparently one of the largest pure wood structures in the world. And it exudes a sense of calm, as you would hope. The various shrines all have statues that all have stories behind them of the craftspeople that create them.I think in another thousand years time the Chi Lin Nunnery will still be standing and considered one of the most impressive feats of 20th century building."

The nunnery was modeled after Tang Dynasty architecture. It is a large temple complex consisting of many wooden structures, elegantly designed and built. Entrance is through a few flights of steps. After passing through the courtyard we entered the first of three halls. The halls housed many gold, wood and clay statues of various buddhas. We did not visit the second hall. It was more of the same. The third hall was closed to visitors.At the side of the temple complex there is a lotus pond, but it being winter time the lotus were not in full bloom. Nevertheless, it was soul-soothing when relaxing by the pond. We can also have another view of Nan Lian Gardens, this time from a higher vantage point.Most visitors would combine these two attractions in one visit. It would be time well spent, away from the hustle and bustle of the city."

It is kept in perfect order and is a pleasant 1 to 2 hour place to visit whilst in HK and wishing to seek a little culture and/or history. It has a number of small temples within which like the grounds are well kept and in prefect order.If you want to go beyond shopping in HK I would recommend a visit."

You can take photos from the outside garden portion but not once you step through the gate, so be respectful of that.

Hong Kong is exciting but can be exhausting so a place like this is a treasure especially as it too is surrounded by concrete building and busy roads, which remarkably do not impact on this special place. The train from Central takes you to Diamond Hill, with just one change, and the nunnery is a five minute walk from this station.My friends have now visited and were as enchanted as we were and will return with visitors in future so that is a good endorsement in itself.

The place is extremely easy to get to , its situated just next to the MTR station and a Mall so you are covered even if a walk in the park isn't your kind of thing. However i do recommend a visit here once you are done with all the superficial things in HK.The place itself is very calm and beautiful, you get a glimpse of HK high rise along with the traditional temple and that makes a pretty picture. Most importantly there is a vegetarian restaurant right inside the premise that made my day :).To all those who have been to Japan its similar to the Japanese garden that you will find in Himeji Castle ..."

You must visit the Nan Liam Garden and attached Chi Lin Nunnery for the serenity and drop-dead gorgeous gardens as well as for the majesty of the Nunnery complex. You can get there by subway, one change if from Central or try the 671 bus from Causeway near the fire station for a fascinating top-deck view of the Hong Kong and Kowloon areas where people live. Diamond Hill MTR station at Hollywood Plaza is adjacent to the gardens. The complex is free, the gardens and the buildings are amazingly beautiful, the peace and serenity just wash away all the noise and bustle of Hong Kong, and you can rest with a tea or coffee and a snack or even have a meal. The bonsai trees are a marvel in the Nunnery grounds. Even the public toilets are a marvel of cleanliness! It's a bit of a journey to get out there (expensive by taxi so use public transport) but you will not regret your visit to this site. I visit HK annually so I am hoping to have a pure sunny day so I can zip out here for perfect photos."

How can a gentle breeze be caressing your cheek, birds nattering quietly from the sculpted trees, and a young woman standing at the edge of a large pond tossing fish food to more than 50 very, very large carp frothing hungrily before her? it's the Chi Lin Nunnery garden, a truly astonishing place to visit in the midst of Hong Kong's 7.2 million residents. Leave the garden and stroll over the long road-crossing pedestrian bridge to the equally astonishing monastery complex, built entirely of wood with no metal whatsoever except for some decorative touches. Walk through gates and a courtyard and another gate and another courtyard and end up in the Main Hall with its five large golden statues portraying the Buddha, two Bodhisattva, and two disciples. No photography in the Main Hall, but allowed elsewhere. It must have cost hundreds of millions to build the complex and the garden, and the result showcases the Chinese aesthetic sensibility and building and gardening skills. There is a hall which includes detailed models of earlier monasteries and other buildings which inspired this one. It is almost easier to understand how the Chi Lin buildings were designed and created than how the very large garden came into being since gardens take a good deal of time to come into their own. This one, while there are a few places in it that seem not yet fully evolved, on the whole is quite like a garden that has been around for a very long time. The rocks, perhaps a bit excessive in a couple of places, are world class. The trees are bonsaied and pruned magnificently, and all the elements have been placed according to an exquisite sensibility. If you like beauty and nature and peace, this is the place to go."

The walk to the plac itself was pleasant as the weather was lovely. As soon as I entered , it started drizzling ! The beauty of this place just glorified in the rains! There were very few people inside and the peace was just sinking in...The garden is maintained perfectly and is of significance. They have a souvenier shop as well. The feel that you get in the main Altar is ineffable and one should experience that to understand this place ;-) The architecture is lovely and flawless !My friend had recommended Nan Li garden (just in front of the Nunnery across the road), however I could just barely spend five minutes due to time constraint !In short, its worth a visit !"

Very easy to get to on the metro as it is less than a 5min walk from the the Dimond hill Station. I started at the Nunnery then walked across the bridge to the adjacent park. It was a rainy Sunday afternoon so the park was not swarmed with people. From what I hear it can get pretty busy. Thankfully that was not the case on the day I went. In the garden I came to a beautiful tea house where I stopped for an hr or so and enjoyed some refreshments while taking in the scenery. Don't miss the pavilion where there is an exhibit explaining how these buildings are built. Ancient Chinese architectural technique using no metal fasteners. I rounded out the day with a 2hr massage, dinner at Din Tai Fung and a glass of whisky at the Peninsula Hotel. One of the best days in HK so far!!"

The beautifully landscaped gardens and exhibition buildings, the magnificent Tang Dynasty temple complex and the hillside location all meld into an awe inspiring experience, whether you are a Buddhist or not. Add to this a beautifully simple vegetarian restaurant, fronted by a waterfall, which serves delicious, MSG-free meals (sadly a rarity for Chinese vegetarian restaurants in Hong Kong) and you have a must visit destination, which, selfishly, I hope the big tour groups will manage to avoid."

I knew that Chi Lin was connected to the Garden via a bridge but I was planning on giving Chi Lin a miss as I thought at the time that it would be like every other place of worship which all seems to blend into one after a while. What sets Chi Lin apart is the atmosphere and the sensory experience to be had at Chi Lin.At each of the altars, they burn fragrant incense (I think it might be high quality sandalwood) which smelt so lovely that I took another walk around the altars just to smell the incense. When I was there, I also heard some chanting (I couldn't figure out if it was a CD being played or if it was the sound of the actual monks chanting) which added to the mystical atmosphere at Chi Lin.You can't take pictures of the altars. That wasn't really a problem for me as I thought that a picture wouldn't do Chi Lin justice. The lotus ponds at the entrance of Chi Lin are photographable and make for pretty pictures. I was there on a weekday at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, and there were only a few people walking around - a welcome respite from the crowd in Hong Kong."

Whats more, the building is of Tang's style. It is rare to find such gem in HK, not to mention in the city centre."

You are not judged by how you dress, what you wear, and whom you are.I like it.Unfortunately, the rain on that day had delayed my visit so it was about closing time when I reached there. And it also prevented me from really exploring the nunnery in detail, but still, I had a good look at most of what was inside. You could really spent an hour or so, strolling around and taking in the peace. No wonder they say, when one enters the mountain gate (the main entrance to the nunnery), one leaves behind the tribulations of the secular world."

I believe it was free. The docent told us about the various architectural features of the grounds and garden. Supposedly, this tour can be done in English and Cantonese. I'm not sure if any other languages are available as well. When you are here, don't forget to also visit the gift shop on the nunnery side of the grounds as well as the restaurant on the garden side.

Conveniently located within a few minutes' walk from Diamond Hill MTR station. The temple is a mix of Chinese and Japanese design and setting. With all wood structure and no nails used, the dark wood structure with the setting demands peace and quiet. You'll feel compelled to mediate and admire.If you can ignore the high rises close to the temple and look onto the garden side, you thought you are in another place, another era. There is no incense burning to sting your eyes and nose. For some reason, this site is ignored by tourist groups. So visit on a weekday and admire the temple structure."

The nunnery is split into two sections, on one side is a park with various small exhibits that is meticulously kept with beautifully shaped trees and shrubs. The exhibits are only okay, nothing spectacular but worth a quick look. There is a nice souvenir shop that sell some nice stuff that is well displayed and some of it is exclusive to the nunnery. My favorite part of the park section is the restaurant that is behind the small waterfall, the vegetarian food is very good and is run by the nunnery, the hours are a little weird so check their opening hours before heading there. The only thing I don't like is a gaudy gold pagoda that is located in the park that doesn't seem very fitting. The nunnery is out of the way enough that it isn't a huge tourist attraction, so on most days there shouldn't huge crowds.The other parts of the nunnery include the main temple complex across the road from the park, its also very picturesque and a little Japanese Zen inspired in its landscaping. Its very clean and well kept and definitely worth a visit. Next to the temple complex is a school that is often overlooked by tourists. In it you can join free meditation classes and there is an awesome book shop that sells a huge array of books and paraphernalia related to Buddhism. I've found quite a few gems in this shop in my time. Highly recommended!"

Personally it is a beautiful garden and monastery to visit in Hong Kong located at Diamond Hill accessible by MTR directly. The monastery founded long ago but too bad it was rebuild with modern architecture without proper procedures even the temple constructed using inter locking system without iron nails. Here is my review on Chi Lin: - Attraction Highlight: There is Nan Lian garden and Chi Lin Nunnery Monastery where the garden built with beautiful bonsai and resting area in Chinese garden style follow by the traditional Chinese temple Chi Lin attraction.Attraction Tip: Go directly to Nan Lian Garden first to enjoy the beautiful garden before visiting the Chi Lin Monastery. At Chi Lin there are 2 sections when you enter the main entrance then you come to the first big sector of garden area, then enter the center building to go to the main hall where there are Buddha and goddess located at the second section."

Different Buddha statues in the buildings. Definitely my favourite temple now in Hong Kong. They have a small gift shop which has lots of interesting things. Money raised to fund the Nunnery.

The absence of the hordes that we saw at the Wong Tai Sin Taoist Temple and the large outdoor courtyard no doubt contributed to the more serene feel of the nunnery. The buildings were almost all wooden, simpler in style than the Taoist temple and without ornate decoration. There were, though, beautiful prayer rooms in which gorgeous statues relevant to the faith were situated and which statues had lovely, exquisitely arranged offerings of fruit and flowers. Gentle music was piped in with a chanter singing a soothing song or prayer. This is truly a refuge and one very worth a visit.

It is a Buddhist temple in relatively modern building, but built in a traditional style. It is very well kept and a haven of solitude, despite the roaring noise of the rest of Honk Kong just a few metres away. Don't forget your camera, you will want to take plenty of photos."

A great getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city itself. We enjoyed the walk around the gardens first and were overawed by the beauty of the nunnery and its surroundings. Pity photos weren't allowed inside but understandable that it was a place to be respected. It was immaculately clean and the offerings to Buddha were so colourful and beautifully laid out.

Lovely gift shop and good plaza nearby (Hollywood Plaza) with Giordano, Uniqlo, Lees and Levi's, M&S, HnM and more. Food Republic is the place to get incredible and authentic cheap lunch!"

I do no think there is much to say about this place; good for a quick look but need not spend too much time here. The tacky gift shop is always a little off putting in a place which is supposed to be about spirituality.

They're usually timeworn and exotic and in low density locales. Quite frankly I was curious as to what this place would look and feel like in the middle of my favorite mega-city. It is definitely a sharp counterpoise to the rest of Hong Kong. Even though it is surrounded by highrises, the atmosphere is quite calming. It feels self-contained and relaxed. I meditated there and in retrospect, there were no extraneous sounds of the City seeping in - just rustling leaves and some gurgling fountains. I can definitely use the word refreshing. Also, it was not particularly crowded.Adjacent to the nunnery is a municipal park which we entered almost as an afterthought. Glad we did: beautifully maintained and with two small museums- one full of huge scale models of the various temple types and the other for \"connoisseurs\" of rocks. Both were quite engaging and also a pleasant surprise. It's all about a 5 minute walk from the Metro and a nice interlude from the crush of urbanism that is Hong Kong."

Took the subway to the other side of the island and walking distance you are there. There are 2 parts and nunnery part closes a bit earlier than the park side. They had a bit of the introduction of the architect and also a \"bonsai\"??? garden, you get to see glamourous little trees, thought only Japan has it."

The architecture is stunning as it's kinda similar to forbidden city, but this is occupied with temple halls and ponds. I spent my early evening strolling around Chi Lin Nunnery and i must say, it's all worth it.

It's a very calm and quiet place, but just a large building with a sizeable court and a small area for you to burn some incense around the side (back) of the building.

The Buddhist art work is wonderful, and the entire site is well maintained. All in all, it's a calm oasis in the middle of an extremely crowded and busy city, and worth the visit independent of your faith."

Super easy to get to via Metro.As we walked up to the Chi Lin, the thing that kept running through my mind was, centuries ago a nunnery was an escape a place out of the city typically at the top of a hill or up the mountain. But here we are walking from the subway across a street and up a slight incline. By the lay of the land you can tell the development around the nunnery has swallowed the history yet left it in tact. Recently renovated, if you look closely you can see the original roofing components, so different from western roofing. It is a builders dream to see such a building standing and renovated. The culture and daily practices make this a very special and sacred place to the locals and Buddhists a far. If you are traveling in July or August make sure you have plenty of water. There is a place to buy refreshments, but even though it is a short walk as always in Hong Kong the heat will get to you. When you cross the road to the park another magical experience comes your way as you are able to see the old style pagodas and gardens that the Chinese cultures prides itself on. I do agree with others who have posted here, These Gardens rival any Japanese style you will find. Simply beautiful. Unique components are found looking past the renovations and looking for the original land barriers, fences and internal roads of the nunnery. This is what takes you back to understand how these people lived in comparison to today;s modern Hong Kong/Kowloon.The pictures you can take at this location are truly a kodak moment(s) when you plan and shoot across the pond or at the waterfall across the street, and at night when it is all lit up it is spectacular. You will want to catch as much as you can without a flash."

The gentleman at the information booth was so welcoming to me as a visitor of his city and that was a special touch. In certain parts of the garden there is spa-type music playing and it was delightful to just sit for a little bit to enjoy and contemplate the beauty. The morning that I was there, it was softly raining so I can only imagine how beautiful this garden would be on a pretty day! Note that the Pavillon is currently under bamboo scaffolding and wrap for restoration until late January 2015. That was the only bummer.There are numerous clean restrooms onsite, a wonderful gift shop that had unique items at surprisingly reasonable prices and a little snack house where I enjoyed mik tea and toast for 25 HKD/$3 USD. There is also a more formal Tea House that is open in the afternoon that looked exquisite - unfortunately I was there in the morning before it opened."

If you are interested in Chinese religion and architecture, here's a great itinerary: First take the subway to see the popular Taoist Wongtaisin Temple (Wongtaisin stop) to mingle and worship with hundreds of followers. This colorful but \"slightly\" garish temple compound is exciting, with lots of people praying, chatting, smoke and incense, red lanterns and colorful paper offerings. When you finally need a break to breathe in some fresh air, exit the temple and have a nice 15-minute stroll up the main road. Suddenly, in front of you appears an absolutely beautifully landscaped Nan Lian Garden. You feel you are in a different world. The Chinese-style garden is a public park in which every tree, shrub, rock, waterfall and hilly mound are designed according to traditional Chinese landscaping and geomancy. It has some resemblance to a Japanese Zen garden. It's the perfect place for resting your tired body and mind. Air is purer here, it seems. Everywhere in the park is photogenic. Adjoining the garden is the Buddhist Chi Lian Nunnery. It was renovated in 1990, and is most famous for its Tang Dynasty-style wood architecture. The complex includes temple halls, lotus ponds, and many Buddhist relics and scriptures. There were only a number of visitors, and no burning incense etc. We could hear soft soothing Buddhist chants and prayers being broadcast through speakers. So take your time to enjoy this serene and body/mind-cleansing place, because very soon you will be lost in the real bustling Hong Kong again."

It was rebuilt in the 1990's following the style of Tang Dynasty traditional Chinese architecture. The present-day buildings are wood frame buildings built without the use of any iron nails. This construction is based on traditional Chinese architectural techniques dating from the Tang Dynasty that uses special interlocking systems cut into the wood to hold them in place. The Chi Lin Nunnery buildings are the only buildings to be built in this style in modern day Hong Kong.Within the grounds of the temple are beautiful Lotus Pools with dragon head fountains, immaculately trimmed tress and shrubs and the contrasting views against the backdrop on Kowloon tower blocks is awesome.There is a bridge / walkway that goes from the Chi Lin Temple Lotus Pools to the 'Nan Lian Garden' which is also worth a walk around as it's another special place of tranquillity."

The place covers both sides of the road and it is beautiful and calm. There is a bonsai garden. Even the tourist shop is calm and gives a less than commercial feeling. There were not a lot of tourists, which makes the enjoyment of the Zen surroundings even better.We headed for the restaurant and since it was lunch time and we did not have a reservation, the wait was about 45 minutes. We took that opportunity to walk around the grounds and visit the koi fishes in the pond. The restaurant has a water wheel next to it and indeed, both picture windows were behind waterfalls, Once seated inside (and be prepared to share the table with other guests), there is a menu for two, specially geared towards the minimum charge required. We opted to upgrade to the next set lunch and turned out there was so much food we had doggie bags. The food is very good and non greasy and for a non-vegetarian, it was a pleasurable experience.I would recommend visiting the Nunnery and a reservation beforehand is recommended for the restaurant."

Lovely examples of large bonsai & interesting trees & bougainvillea pruned in the cloud formation which the Chinese do so well. Go there at about 10.00 a.m. Before the crowds arrive. Most enjoyable."

Chi Lin is a Buddhist Nunnery and as such is very peaceful and tranquil, a perfect place to spend a few relaxing hours. Photography is permitted in the Courtyard but not in any of the Temples. Chi Lin, although very modern, it was only completed in 2006, is built in the Tang Dynasty style. Of interest no nails were used throughout its construction. Chi Lin is now on the 'Tentative List' of China's World Heritage sites. Highly Recommend."

It is a serene complex with worshipers coming to offer prayers and tributes to the various Celestial kings and gods, each housed in their own room, surrounded by lotus ponds.

From there follow the directions to Nan Lian Gardens. The gardens are about 100meters away. There is no entrance fee. The visit will take you about 2 hours, including the Chi Lin Nunnery and the Nan Lian Gardens, technically another attraction, by a bridge. Both can be visited without ever coming on the road.*) As with other Buddhist Worship places, photography is not allowed in the Prayer Halls. In the rest of the area you can take pictures.*) As far as I can say, Chi Lin Nunnery does not have any eateries. Its the Nan Lian Gardens that has a full-fledged restaurant and another snack place. *) A lot of wooden artifacts and beautiful ponds with flowers and lots of bonsai trees. The whole architecture is magnificient.*) The nunnery is an amazing replica of a Tang dynasty Bhuddist nunnery and is built totally from hardwoods using no nails or glues only joints in the timber.

The beauty and tranquility of this site is much more impactful in real life vs. what you see in pictures. There was a lite mist / rain the day we went which added to the atmosphere and may have kept the crowds at bay as it was relatively empty. One minor disappointment was that the main red bridge and adjoining temple / pagoda that you see in pictures is currently under construction (until 2015 I believe) and for that reason is covered. There is still plenty to see however I really would love to have seen that key element of the nunnery.I also wished there had been some sort of interactive display at the start to provide some context to the history of the nunnery. The facility is free of charge and my expectations are therefore adjusted accordingly and stands on it's own based on sheer beauty, but I would have loved more context on the history.Overall, it was a great visit.

We thought this even better as it meant it was clearly still in use. However, instead of allowing us to slowly move away following acknowledgement that prayers were to commence (so not to intrude on the religious activities), instead the local workers felt a better way to shoo a few tourists (no more than 8 of us total) was to shout and start pushing us away using metal fences.

The Diamond Hill MTR stop is four minutes away, and the signs are pretty clear. Cross Fun Tak road on a crosswalk to footbridge to reach the temples.

By HK standards, it's a little bit further out than most are willing to venture but it's super convenient given HK's transport system and cheap taxi rates. Definitely worth a visit, as it is a very different experience from the hustle and bustle of the touristy Central or TST. The gardens are beautiful and serene, you feel transported miles away from the crowds in the shopping malls and high rise buildings. There is a gorgeous vegetarian yum cha restaurant under a waterfall which gets very busy but which I would also recommend for visitors. It's such a change from the normal touristy activities in Hong Kong (basically eating and shopping) and you get to see further into the Kowloon side than you usually would on the trip there. Definitely worth a visit! Reminds of Japanese gardens and temples, it's just divine! There is also a cute little souvenir store with lots of very affordable little trinkets and mementos - we loaded up for presents!"

Bear in mind all the charges (some are free) are going to support the maintenance for the nunnery. Remember to get a free copy catalog that introduces to you the Chi Lin Nunnery. A must go for all who visit HK!"

Tucked away in Diamond Hill, you cross a bridge and encounter this absolutely beautiful garden, which serves as a nunnery for Buddhists. The cleanliness, serenity, and peacefulness blew me away mainly because the rest of Hong Kong is so busy. There weren't a lot of tourists either - so that made me very pleased. Whether you are a devote Buddhist or a person who just enjoys taking quiet walks, this place is definitely a must visit. The greenery is absolutely gorgeous and everything is just so well maintained and kept. The people there are also extremely nice and their restaurant is also fantastic. You will not be disappointed with this lovely gem in Hong Kong!!"

There are four temples with impressive golden statues of Buddhivista in (I think) various stages of his journey to enlightenment, together with some of his key disciples. We could hear, but not see, the Nuns chanting while we were there which added to the atmosphere of our visit. The wooden buildings are incredibly intricate and were designed to avoid the use of any nails by using very complex mortise-and-tenon joints.The temples are surrounded by superb lotus ponds and small trees. These provided lots of opportunities for photo - enthusiasts. (But photos of the Buddha were not welcome!)We recommend visiting Chi Lin if you need to \"recharge your batteries\" after a lot of shopping or are tired of hustle and bustle."

I visited the nunnery and adjoining gardens with a friend and had such a wonderful time taking in the beautiful surroundings. The nunnery consists of traditional wooden chinese style buildings. I was told, that apparently no nails were used to build the wooden structures but that the sections of wood were handcrafted to fit together perfectly. In the middle of the nunnery there are beautiful, serene lotus ponds and bonsai gardens which makes for stunning photographs. Inside the various halls there are ornate buddhist shrines with fresh offerings of fruit and incense. You will not be allowed to take photographs inside the halls/temples though. There were peaceful, musical buddhist chanting in the background but it's a CD that is being broadcast over hidden speakers. Nevertheless, it still contributed towards the ambience whilst taking the beautiful surroundings.And it's free to enter! In most other countries a beautiful place like this would have an entrance fee so quite impressed. There is a souvenir shop that sells the usual tat but they look slightly better quality than that you'll find at Stanley market, for example.Then, adjoining the nunnery is the Beautiful Nan Lian garden that's accessible via a relatively new foot bridge across the road. The gardens reflect the same serenity than the nunnery does. There are sparkling clear ponds full of Khoi, traditional looking footbridges leading to colourful pagodas, perfectly manicured trees and shrubs. I must add that one was not allowed on these footbridges, they are probably ornamental but still adds the beauty. There is a vegetarian restaurant within the gardens hidden behind a man-made waterfall. We had a set lunch there which was good value at around $120HKD p/p consisting of around 4 dishes. However, the food was completely bland and we had to ask for some chillies and soy to make the food edible. But overall it was still an enjoyable experience and the gardens make for stunning photographs."

I went to the garden on the same trip as I went to Mainland China and it really reminded me of the Chen Family Academy in Guangzhou. It is quite a beautiful garden and a very quiet place next to the bustling metropolis of Hong Kong. Bonus points for being free.In theory this is how a real Chinese garden should look, which would make it a must-see attraction, but for some reason though I didn't feel any amazement or any special feeling toward the place. Maybe it's because I had visited dozens of Chinese temples in Mainland China beforehand, or maybe it's because I was tired after a long (and hot) day in Hong Kong.Still, it is worth a visit if you're in the area, and the Nan Lian garden right across is a great place to just sit back and relax."

The congee is plain so expect it to taste of plain boiled rice but it is a nice contrast to the other dishes. A pot of tea is also included. 105HKD each and we were full.

The rich dark wood architecture of the buildings and temples are very beautiful. There are many buildings but some house the monks and schools, so not all are accessible but still more than enough to see. The Buddha statues are some of the most beautiful I have ever seen. The entire complex is very serene, peaceful and moving. Great for a day to slow down, see great cultural historic scenes and reflect for awhile. A definite visit. On your walk back to the subway, the mall offers a chance for something to eat or drink and a chance to sit for awhile.

The nunnery is very tranquil and well maintained away from huge crowds and noise of Hong Kong. There are two vegetarian restaurants here. We also saw the Nan Lian Gardens by the bridge and there is no entrance fee here."

Not being one of a particularly religious persuasion, I was a little wary of taking a trip out to see a nunnery.The site is easily accessible, a mere 20/25 minutes from TST by metro. Simply take the line to Diamond Hil, exit to the left and the nunnery is best approached after strolling round the gardens. A great place to escape the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong, enjoy the peace and tranquility. Be sure though to show respect to those wishing to pray."

If you are looking for the HK noise and crowds this is not for you.It is a Buddhist nunnery, so very tranquil, it was designed for pray. I personnelly find it very relaxing as there are buddhist chanting played softly in the back ground.The nunnery is split into 2 part, the nunnary and the gardens (seperated by the road). The gardens contain 2 vegetarian resturants/cafe, the more expensive is situated by the waterfall. It is a real tonic from the noise of HK.Luckly the nunnary has not been found by the mainland chinese so it is still very peaceful, but if you want to see a lively temple, Won tai Sin just 1 stop before Diamand Hill, it is rammed with mainlanders and has fortune tellers and many stall selling buddhist tack, I recommend you visit both for the comparison. Both enjoyable but in different ways."

The MTR is clean, bright, so easy to navigate and almost deserted outside of the rush hour. The nunnery is an amazing replica of a Tang dynasty Bhuddist nunnery and is built totally from hardwoods using no nails or glues only joints in the timber. Situated in the Diamond Hill area of this most bustling of cities the calm that emanates from the places feels almost physical.We loved the quiet, the trees and flowers, the lotus ponds and photo opportunities (but do not use the camera inside the halls -very bad karma). The nunnery is a working temple and a charity so we bought some keepsakes and were given small gifts and a CD of chants recorded at the temple. A most wonderful experience"

But, a short walk under the (also inevitable) concrete flyover you can access the grounds of this nunnery. Inside there are many traditional buildings culminating in the main temple. There are also,exhibits on the finer points of Chinese wooden building construction if you're interested, and various displays of polished weathered rocks, which you can stroke and sit upon. In the centre is a golden temple set in a lake with red bridges either side. It's very picturesque, especially if you squint so as to block out the wall of shabby tenement buildings which, again inevitably for Hong Kong, surround the site. It all looks old, but I think is actually quite new. It has a bit of a Disneyfied air to it, but it is a genuine spiritual Bhuddist site, which brings with it an air of calm and contemplation. Worth a visit if you've already ticked off the main tourist attractions, or if you just want to escape the Hong Kong rat race."

You cannot ignore the high rise buildings in the view, but the juxtaposition of the old and the new is itself quite a sight.A walk over the footbridge nod you arrive at the connected gardens the main feature of which is a large red pagoda set in the middle of a small lake.the gardens are I immaculately looked after with not a leaf out of place.If you want and escape from the busy hustle and bustle of the town centre this is a great place to pass some time.Don't forget the camera though or you'll regret it."

Get on Kwun Tong Line (end station is Tiu Keng Leng), get off on Diamond Hill station. No need to get into the Hollywood Plaza (mall)--NanLian Garden is just couple minutes walk. Then after finishing Chi Lin Nunnery is right on the other side.For food, there is Chi Lin Vegetarian inside the Garden.The whole entire area is free of charge and great escape from the city life. With all the different type of trees, rocks, landscaping and all the traditional buildings (built in Tang Dynasty style with not one single nail being used), it is definitely a MUST SEE (few hours at least) while in Hong Kong."

That way you can appreciate the tranquility this place offers in busy Hong Kong. It is conveniently located at Daimond Hill MTR station (take Exit C). The complex is built in the Tang Dynasty style and there are so many beautiful plants to see. This visit certainly relaxes and refresh the mind and body. As the nunnery is next to the famous Nan Lian Garden and also has a vegetarian restaurant, it is truly worth visiting this place. I spent more than 3 hours here and took lots of pictures. Oh, if you want some noise and city life after the visit, there's a huge mall next to this place called the Hollywood Mall."

Tucked away neatly in the corner of a busy, bustling global city, the Chi Lin Nunnery is the perfect example of the harmony between ancient and modern worlds. Away from the traffic jams and the tensions of worklife, the nunnery provided much needed spiritual and mental peace to the visitors. The moment visitors enter this nunnery, all the sounds of the busy life vanish from one's ears and mind. The beautiful sound of clean water softly hitting the nunnery's pools, the calm faces of the various bodhisattvas and the impressive bonasai works immediately capture your attention. The calm, pensive faces of the Bodhisattvas fill you with a world of optimism and positive energy, driving away all your tensions and worries from your mind.If you are into cultural tourism, you can kneel down on the specially provided prayer cushions and offer a prayer to the great Buddhas; and if you are not, you can enjoy the lovely traditional gardens by clicking your photos with them as your background.A single disappointment is that you won't be allowed to click the pictures of the Buddhas and the bodhisattvas at the altars. To the avid collectors, there is a wonderful souvenir shop onto the right side of the nunnery, as soon as you enter the premises. Though one has to be careful about its pricing."

It is more like Japanese Style in my view.how to get there is so easy, just 5-10 min walk along the sign."

            "review": "Amazing place (to be reviewed together with Nan Lian Garden). I am totally amaze to find this tranquil and serene place in the middle of the concrete jungle of HK city! Firstly, the attraction is that the entrance is free. You will see a lot of old folks either on tour or some doing exercises in this beautiful garden. The beautiful bonzais in the garden are a joy to look at. There is a cafe and souvenier shop in the grounds. Also you will find a vegetarian restaurant (check opening times). The menu is available outside the restaurant and I believe it is HKD105 per pax for 1 set vegetarian meal.After wondering around the gardens, we walked over to the nunnery. You have to cross like a bridge to get to the nunnery. This is a massive building and the different types of buddhas and kuan yin statues are really stunning! I have seen many in different countries and must say I was impressed. Those devout Buddhist can pay their respect and burn some incense if they choose to. Very huge courtyard too. I have been to HK numerous times but am surprised I have not visitied this awesome place before. How to get there: Take the MTR and exit at Diamond Hill station. The MTR is at the shopping center called Plaza Hollywood. This is a cool shopping place and also plenty of food joints. Follow the exit signs and exit at Exit C2. You will be able to see signages to Nan Lian Garden. It is about 5 mins away. The garden will lead you to Chi Lin Nunnery so you should enter this garden. Both are worth the journey there and if you get bored, can detour back to Plaza Hollywood for some shopping and food."

Head up the sidewalk outside the mall and cross to the right at the top of the slight incline where the cross walk is. Visit the nunnery first. Last time I was there they had beautiful bonsai trees on display near the lotus pools. The Buddhas are nicely displayed and if you happen to visit on a festival or public holiday, there may be volunteers handing out good fortunes. The have a really nice souvenir shop where I have purchased a bracelet on each visit. After visiting the nunnery, walk across the elevated walkway to enter the Nan Lian Garden. This is my favorite part of the visit. The garden has lovel vistas, gardens, a small art gallery, a restaurant, a rock display and even a water wheel. What is even more amazing is the contrast of peaceful garden to towering skyscrapers and bustling Hong Kong roadways surrounding it. If you are thirsty after a couple hours wandering the nunnery and gardens stop in Hollywood mall. There is a Starbucks on the upper level near the atrium."

            "review": "Remains one of our favourite places to visit in Hong Kong. The Chi Lin Nunnery is a Buddhist complex that remains one of our personal favorite places to visit in Hong Kong. It is one of the most beautiful and well-maintained attractions in the city and it is free to visit. We recommend seeing the Chi Lin Nunnery together with the adjacent Nan Lian Gardens. The Nunnery was originally built in 1934 and was opened to the public in 1990 after being renovated in Tang Dynasty style. Since that time, it has become a very popular place to visit for Hong Kong residents and visitors. We usually approach the Nunnery from the Nan Lian Gardens, where you cross a decorative bridge to the main entrance. You first enter a lovely and elegant Lotus Pond Garden (open 7.00am - 7.00pm), featuring a courtyard with four small ponds, various shrines and statues, manicured bonsai and other trees. The landscaping seen throughout this courtyard (as well as the second inner-courtyard that you will see next) is just lovely and helps create a tranquil environment when visiting Chi Lin Nunnery. Towards the back of the Lotus Pond Gardens, you will approach steps leading you to the entrance to the second courtyard (open 9.30am - 4.30pm), which includes a mentioned landscaped courtyard, surrounded by various Halls of worship. Each hall features wooden figures or gilded statues of various manifestations of Buddha. The highlight for us is the Main Hall found towards the back of this courtyard, featuring five gilded statues, three of Buddha and two of his attending disciples. There are information signs next to each of the Halls to help explain what you are seeing. There are bathroom facilities and opportunities to buy souvenirs at the Chi Lin Nunnery. Another way to support the nunnery is to dine at the Chi Lin Vegetarian restaurant located in the back of the Nan Lian Gardens. All restaurant proceeds go towards conservation and management of the gardens. Tip: We enjoy making visits during the Chinese New Year period as the nunnery is much less manic compared to other temples that we like in Hong Kong. Many of the landscaped trees are in bloom this time of year as well. Tip: Photography is allowed in the courtyard areas of Chi Lin Nunnery. However, it is not allowed in the Halls and you are asked to not take pictures of the Buddha statues as well."

You never realize in this overcrowded, overrated city, you can still find a heavenly place like this.There are two parts to the visit, the Chi Lin Nunnery and the Nan Lian Gardens. The Nunnery is a tranquil place well deserve your respect. But I will visit the Nan Lian Garden first. It is closer to the MTR station. The rocks, the trees, the golder pagoda, the pond, everything in such a harmony. Please ignore the 4 overhead highways right at the entrance. Don't let that bother you.At the end of the visit, you will see a set of stairs that will take you to the Nunnery. (Be aware, some times the stairs are closed, then you will have to exit the garden, turn right, and circle around the outside wall and take the stairs outside.A bridge will guide you to the main entrance of the nunnery. There are good description of the main gate, different Buddha statues that will entice your interest. But if you are not the religious or educational type, the big flowering bonsais, the lily ponds will.Look at the whole structure, from the main gate, pass the lily ponds to the main building, it resembles the palaces in Seoul, Korea.Enjoy it, take a lot of pictures or just sit down and reflect the purpose of your life. You will be happy that you come.If you like, have lunch at the veg place in the Garden. It's tailor towards the sweet and sour type of tourists and at extreme price. There are better veg restaurants out there. I try the one right next to Wong Tai Sin Temple, which is only one MTR stop away (take it from the Hollywood Plaza). I got better satisfaction there.Yes, MTR is probably a good choice to take you there. Bus route # 11 will get you there too."

Only one negative things that they do not allow to take the photos of all big golden Buddha, and I must say that all these buddha\u2019s are awesome.Tips1. Buy mobile sim card with data package (1 week unlimited data) which would help you to navigate the location in google at anytime. This you can buy right after the immigration counter of HK airport, at the time of arrival. 2. You can go comfortably with baby with stroller, there are staircases but also there is also an options go with baby stroller upto the ponds area, after that only staircases for golden big buddhas."

It is everything that is written about it.The place is beautiful and while you can still hear the road noise it is wonderfully peaceful. Some of thea areas are in use by the Nuns and you must respect certain restrictions such as no photographs within the prayer areas. One other not so obvious restriction is that you can't sit down (I did on some steps and politely got told to stand up). If you are based on the island or in Kowloon this place is a short MTR ride and only a 2 min walk from Diamond Hill station, it is well worth a visit."

            "review": "definitely worth the trip to check out the Nunnery, and Kwun Tong. Remember the plastic toys and clothing that were made in Hong Kong in the 60's and early 70's. They were made in the factories in Diamond Hill and Kwun Tong. As manufacturing in Hong Kong has become extinct, the land has been redeveloped into residential and mall. Best of all, the once dirty, ugly, polluted factories at the heart of Diamond Hill is now a serene and tranquil garden with a Nunnery. if you look south slightly westward in the adjacent park of the nunnery, you can still see a low rise (about 8-10 stories) with very little or small windows, it is the remnants of the factory town, and the building was once a factory. To me, the very appearance of this industrial building that can be spotted from the Nunnery is the best part of the sight seeing. i am just amazed at how Hong Kong has been transformed.The Nunnery itself is a park and a miniature Forbidden City like building designed for budhist nuns. it is truly a nice piece of architect that replicates an ancient building but done in modern times. Pay attention to the joints where the columns meet the roof, it is based on old construction technique that stacks inter locking wooden blocks similar to Lego blocks to ensure strength of the structure against the elements. The technique has been lost in today's Hong Kong, so the nunnery imports Japanese craftsmen to replicate the old architecture. All the wood is from Canadian west coast, and the granite from China. I couldn't help not thinking that the building must have cost a fortune. i asked the local of how on earth the nuns could afford the construction, as it turns out , most of the Hong kong performers in the entertainment business are Buddhists by religion. They might be superstitious in the sense that they want to ensure their career success will last for a long time. (Hong Kong performers not only entertain local populace, but to the whole Asia, so their revenue streams are very substantial). As a result, they donate huge sums to the Buddhists temples. The nunnery is actually a very wealthy institution with lots of real money backing it. The attraction shows that. It is definitely worth the visit, and i have no doubt that it is voted as Traveller Choice winner."

Get off he MTR at Diamond hill, go up the escalator turn right and follow the signs for 200 yards....very very easy to find.As you enter, you are met with beautiful Chinese and dare I say Japenese style gardens. Pools full of Koi carp, ancient Chinese buildings and that is before you entering the temple.The temple is fantastic and so serene.The walk around can take around 1 hour but you could easily stay longer and there is no charge.stunning place"

A working nunnery with a devout and passionate following . Arrange to have the vegetarian lunch which is decent value and pleasant to round off your experience.For those of us who want to understand more of this religion, inquire when there's are chanting ceremonies; a big one in dec. It is truly impressive and gives a deeper insight into the old soul of the Chinese ( both well heeled and common) spirituality . I attended one such major chanting event for a recent passing in my family and had pre registered with the nunnery. It was an amazing and uplifting experience to participate in this even as an overseas Chinese with little experience in the chants. Only draw back is they speak very little English , and I was actually yelled at in English that this was not a tourist attraction when my occidental husband and my kids accompanied me to one of the organized chants. I guess that was the sole English speaking nun, when I tried to explain she continued to yell at me in front of a group of tourists. This was not cool, but could understand there may have been negative experiences. So if you intend to go to any ceremonies be prepared and respectful!"

The MTR system makes it easy to get to from all around the city too. Get on the MTR Kwun Tong Line and get off at Diamond Hill Station (The Hollywood Plaza shopping centre) and follow the signs to the nunnery. It is about a 2 minute walk around the outside of the shopping centre and across a minor road. The Nunnery and gardens (another attraction in itself) are both free to enter and are excellent. The nunnery was quiet tranquil and sedate. The Nunnery has a relaxing garden with lotus ponds and areas of religious significance in the grounds. The Nunnery is a working monastary and therefore none of the religious areas are allowed to be photographed but the garden in the grounds and the attached Nan Lin Gardens may be photographed.The Nunnery and gardens are a great way to spend some time away from the hustle and bustle of the city and get back to nature, even if only for a brief moment in time.There is a small cafe to buy food and drink during the day and also a Vegetarian restaurant located in the Nan Lin Gardens (though this wasn't open during my visit).The Nan Lin Gardens joins the Nunnery via a well designed walk way and is also more than worthy of a visit, in fact I would recommend that you do.I could quite easily visit the Chi Lin Nunnery and the Nan Lian Garden time and time again on numerous trips to Hong Kong and would recommend it to any one thinking of going to Hong Kong."

Especially if you have traveled around Asia and visited Buddhist temples, palaces, Japanese/Korean gardens, etc. I would rather recommend visiting the Big Buddha on Lantau island (which is already on the list) or Sai Kung country park (not on the list), where you can hike if you want to or just take a taxi ride and enjoy picturesque views, rounding up your visit with a nice seafood meal.Chi Lin nunnery is worth visiting if you are on a longish trip to HK and getting tired of eating out, drinking and shopping.

Located at Diamond Hill, transport would have been quite easy by MTR but I was staying on HKG island that week and decided to go by taxi in order to spend more time there. The cost was around HK$120 (I think) and I was lucky there was no traffic jam that day.Nan Lian is situated opposite the Nunnery . Certain areas are off-limit here but there's a gift shop where I purchased two fans with very nice quotes. The sales staff are all volunteers and very helpful. For non-Buddhist we love to buy all those trinkets and bracelets/bangles. But one particular volunteer tipped me that for non-Buddhist it's better to look out for the 'blessed' writing/beads found in some of these things in case there could be a 'clash'. Whether you believe it or not, it's individual. Visitors can also offer 'oil money' (heong yow) so that prayers are offered for the deceased or living. Amount of contribution is not restricted but definitely 'from the heart'.Across the road is Chi Lin Nunnery. I was blown away with the sculptured trees, bonzais and even rocks look so natural (after years of weathering). Architecture was beautiful, so many smaller gardens and buildings to explore and take in. But I like the idea of the water theme, huge ponds filled with kois and goldfish (my favourites) .There's the 'rock gallery', gift shop , vegetarian restaurant (popular with both locals and tourists) sitting behind a manmade waterfall. It's customer friendly as there are stairs as well as lift in the restaurant. Do not expect huge servings here but going in a group certainly helps with bigger selection. Perhaps I was restricted as I was alone that day, but what I ordered tasted delicious (remember it's vegetarian).One exceptional place to pop into is the Chinese Timber Architecture Gallery where you can see (cameras prohibited) mini replicas of famous temples/monastery and even one of the palaces in Forbidden City. Besides that it has smaller structural samples to show the actual construction of these marvellous buildings. There could be upto 7 or 8 different joints just for one beam, all done without a single nail. It is too awesome and I wish there were more. I was also lucky because they had an exhibition of Suzhou Hand Embroidery. Again cameras are forbidden. Entry for this is extra but not expensive. I spent almost 4hours here at a leisurely pace. Definitely will re-visit."

I visited this place along with the Nan Lian Gardens and the monasteries and covered walkways were some of the most impressive I've seen before. Everything was very well cared for and woodwork is just beautiful. The landscaping and shrubs are also very well maintained and created the ultimate picturesque setting for photos (although one is prohibited from taking any photos of the Buddha statues. * There are alot of security officials around the monastery to ensure this.  Pictures can still be taken of the monastery and trees though and when you're inside the perimeter it feels very peaceful and calm.  The weather was nice making for an enjoyable experience as well so try and only go to this place when the weather is nice as the entire area, including Nan Lian gardens, is located outside.  * As it is a place of religious significance, it like the Nan Lian Gardens is free of admission. When you pass through the Nan Lian Gardens which is right below the nunnery, there is a small place where you can actually get drinks and I believe some food so feel free to stop in there if you are hungry or thirsty.  Enjoy and I highly recommend visiting both the Chi Lin Nunnery and Nan Lian Gardens! This place can be easily accessed via the Diamond Hill MTR. Just get off, go out of Exit C2 (I believe) and look for the red sign that says Nan Lian Gardens. Follow the sign and walk across the road and you'll be there in about five minutes."

How to get there: Diamond Hill MTR station, exit C2, 5 min away from the station, follow signs. I would highly recommend to visit and enjoy the serenity of this place.

There are a series of temple halls which house gold, clay and wooden statues, photography is forbidden in these halls.Amazingly Chi Lin was established in 1934 and renovated in the Tang Dynasty without a single nail supporting the entire wooden temple. It is certainly worth a visit, there are some wonderful photo opportunities outside. The nunnery is open from 9.00am-5.00pm and the gardens from 6.30am-7.00pm. To get there get off at Diamond Hill station, take exit C2 and it is a five minute walk. There is no charge to go inside.

It is never busy and very very tranquil. you can spend half a day just walking around admiring the beautiful trees and plants and beautiful marbles and rocks, needless to say their Buddhas. They have a gigantic pond which is like the size of a football field with hundreds of beautiful Kohl Carps fish. They are the stars of the nunnery. There is a museum and also a very clean cafe for people to relax in. There is also a restaurant with waterfall on the outside. The whole place is amazing.

This has been on both our must see lists for Hong Kong for the past several trips, but since we use public transportation, it hasn't made it since it is north of the Mong Kok area and a bit of a way out of our orbit. I'm glad we've crossed it off our list and don't have to think of it as a must do. It isn't. There is a modest, concrete encased garden to walk around, and a concrete path that takes you by several smaller altars as well as the main hall. No photos at any of those, which we scrupulously observe, but that wasn't good enough for the bored, unfriendly \"security\" people who roamed the facility and barked at BOTH of us for imaginary infractions of rules - the chief one seeming to be that we were westerners. The nuns are off somewhere else - this is just a cold, distant place to walk around and, if you Chinese Buddhist, you can pray and leave monetary offerings in a few locales. A must miss."

Less than two minutes walk from the exit of the Diamond Hill MTR station, in the middle of a residential neighborhood, with sky-scraping residential buildings on all sides, and a highway bridge hanging above, you have no idea that this gem can exist here. But as we entered this place, we knew we found a very special place. We made dinner reservations and arrived when it was already dark. The garden looked magical at night, and walking through it, trying to find the restaurant, felt like an amazingly relaxing experience. The restaurant itself is satisfactory: great service, ok food, very cheap, and pretty loud. We would come back just as an excuse to walk through the Nunnery. Pure magic, and very romantic"

There is no charge to enter the nunnery, there is a donation box in front of every temple, any one can donate money into the box, believer or not. The series of temples have similarities to temples in Japan, then I am not an expert. It seems to look like those I visited before in Japan. There are couple of large lotus pond in the centre of the large court yard. It is very soothing entering into the complex. My understanding is that there are tons of people over the weekend. Hong Kong is a tiny place and there aren't that many places that has plenty of greens. Nearly everywhere has plenty of spectacular pine trees. I was so taken to the whole thing.

A little garden haven in the middle of a city.Take metro line to Diamond Hill - only a few minutes from station - and its well signposted from there. The nuns are buddhist and the temples and gardens are absolutely beautiful, with water features and fountains. I love chinese/japanese gardens, and I just loved everything about the landscaping. It is immaculately maintained. Cross the bridge over the road to the garden on the other side (name escapes me!) and again it was WOW, WOW, WOW. With a traditional golden pergoda and footbridge, and ponds and the trees and shrubs are beautifully planted. Has a tea house and a shop.LOVED IT."

I can't imagine you'd see one and skip the other.However, if I'm to speak just of the nunnery, than I'll say that it's a lovely little oasis that doesn't take long to walk around. As far as I could tell, there are two large courtyards that the public has access too. The first contains four ponds and plenty of manicured shrubs and is filled with the sound of running water and birds chirping. The second has several Buddist shines off the walkway around the edges, and the faint scent of incense wafts into the air from these. Some of these shrines are in rooms with large numbers of prayer cushions in them, so I imagine if you get there at the right time, you can see the nuns in prayer. When I was there, recorded chants were being played over a PA system, which was quite soothing, I have to say.

The moment you take in the atmosphere inside with the lotus ponds, Buddha statues, and great architecture, I was just in awe.From the MTR station it will be about 5 to 10 minutes walk but there will be a staircase which will lead to the main entrance, or you can enter the Lotus Pond beside the highway and enter from the side entrance. Some monks were walking around during my visit and a few other people. The weather was gloomy but overall I thought it was a great place to visit. Do check out the Nan Lian Garden across the road."

If you are looking for some quiet and peaceful time away from the craziness of Hong Kong, take the MTR to the Diamond Hill station and follow the signs to the Chi Lin Nunnery. The Nunnery is right in the middle of a residential area of Kowloon, with skyscrapers all around, however when you walk through the gates of the Nunnery its like you have walked into the middle of a secluded temple. The Chi Lin Nunnery is an active Buddhist, and retirement community for Buddhist Nuns, so it is not uncommon to see people making offerings and praying while you visit. You may also see some of the nuns that tend to the gardens. You can take pictures of the exterior of the temples, however you can't take them if you stand inside the entrance way of each temple.The are in Japanese style and are truly amazing. And the landscape within the temple complex is outstanding. I found the temples and the grounds to be very relaxing and really could have stayed there all morning. However you can see the entire grounds and temples in an hour or so, so if you are pressed for time you can still get this in on your visit."

We returned to the Chi Lin Nunnery, along with the Nan Lian Garden this past weekend, as we have many times since having move to Hong Kong. These two attractions, combined have become a favourite spot in Hong Kong to visit and spend time. We do favour the Nan Lian Gardens but the Chi Lin Nunnery is equally as impressive. Exiting Diamond Hill MTR station, below the Plaza Hollywood shopping mall, you are five minutes walk from the Chi Lin Monastery grounds (free entry). However, the Nan Lian Garden (also free entry) is in between these two locations so it makes sense to visit there first. What we love about Chi Lin Monastery is the courtyard lotus ponds and numerous shrubs, plants, trees and bonsai,which are very well-manicured and maintained. We've watched, nurturers painstakingly tend to their projects over the years. The health, appearance and beauty of the specimen within these grounds is testimony to the love and care given at Chi Lin and the results are an impressive courtyard with much to feast your eyes upon. The only complaint we have for the Chi Lin Nunnery is the lack of seating area for visitors, making it more difficult to just sit and enjoy the serenity created within these grounds. There is more opportunity for this form of enjoyment and relaxation across the bridge at the Nan Lian Gardens. The Chi Lin Nunnery is no longer a hidden gem in Hong Kong. It is now regularly considered a top ten attraction in the city, along with the Nan Lian Gardens. It is a place much loved by locals and residents in Hong Kong and something that all visitors should try to make time for. Combined with the Nan Lian Gardens, this is the most beautiful spot in Hong Kong."

I would argue that no trip to Hong Kong is complete without visiting the Chi Lin Nunnery and the associated Nan Lian Garden. Although it was only founded in 1934 and rebuilt in the 1990s, it was built using ancient Chinese architectural techniques and gives you a real idea of what places such as this must've looked like hundreds of years ago. I found the juxtaposition of cultures (ancient temple and gardens separated by modern highway and the huge apartment blocks associated with modern Hong Kong in the background) was particularly interesting. It's within very easy reach of Diamond Hill MTR Station and also has an excellent gift shop."

We have taken all our visitors to Hong Kong to this site and they have all enjoyed it thoroughly, particularly when we share the previous disclaimer in advance. To be sure, there are some people who have visions of ancient temples---for this, go to the Mainland or elsewhere across Asia. There are some very nice photo opps within the grounds of the nunnery, including a golden pagoda, bright red bridge, and some golden koi fish that look like they should be mechanical, but they are real.

            "review": "Best 'Attraction' in Hong Kong...and free!. We visited Chi Lin Nunnery on a morning and intended to stay there a couple of hours before carrying on with our trip. We ended up staying there something like five hours! This is the best place to go if you want a retreat from the hyperactive centre. At the Diamond Hill MTR, you need to go outside the shopping centre and follow the signs, the Nunnery is well indicated. You won't be disappointed. The complex has taken something like 10 years to be built according the Zen rules. As soon as you enter the Nunnery, the peacefulness of the place becomes palpable. The very quiet chants on (hidden) speakers and the constant steam watering of the flora add to the atmosphere. After visiting/viewing all the buildings, including a free exhibition about Buddhist sculptures and paintings, we decided to head for lunch at the Nunnery restaurant, under a cascade. That was probably the best food I had in Hong Kong altogether. It is exclusively vegetarian and specialised in mushrooms. The meal was extremely refined, the (free!) Pu'er tea and mushroom appetizers were of the best quality.In order to finish our incredibly relaxing matinee, we decided to visit the tea house afterwards. It is fairly pricey (\u00a38 per tea, one tea per person compulsory) but it was worth both the tea itself, of excellent quality and abundant quantity, and the tea serving demonstration, surrounded by a wonderful decor. The best place for an escape from hectic Hong Kong."

Very easy to get to, only a few stops from Nathan Road and we combined it with a visit to the gardens across the road from it. The gardens and worship halls were stunning. My 5yr old complained that he was going to be bored there and in the end we had to drag him away ! A very good learning experience for us all.A lovely side to Hong Kong that we hadn't experienced before."

Easy to get to - about 100 metres from the subway and there is no cost! So magnificent value."

The Chi Lin Nunnery hosts a fantastic garden area that rivals anything you will see in the mainland, Korea or Japan. The landscape, quality ponds and plants are very beautiful. The buddha statues inside the compound are in excellent condition and lovely appearance. Combined with the attached Nan Lian Garden, this makes a wonderful combined attraction in Hong Kong, one that our guests find most impressive and one of our personal favorite places in Hong Kong. We personally visit several times a year, its so peaceful and beautiful. We highly recommend the Chi Lin Nunnery as a Top 5 or 10 attraction in Hong Kong"

I generally prefer more 'action' in the tourist attractions that I visit but this side trip was worth it. I won't repeat what others have said but give a few details, that we discovered, not previously mentioned. Take the MTR to Diamond Hill, use the C2 exit. At the top of the 2nd lot of esculators turn right, prior to entering the shopping centre. Nan Lian Garden is directly over the road but you have to walk up to the top of the road and use the pedestrian crossing to get to the entrance. At the end of Nan Lian Garden you flow seamlessly onto the steps that lead to Chi Lin Nunnery (Buddist Monastry/Nunnery). Both Nan Lian and Chi Lin are free. We took a little over an hour to stroll through both but the time flew. My young teenage daughter enjoyed the whole she-bang as much as we did. Be carefull, the camera will get a workout, but you can't use them inside any of the displays. When leaving Chi Lin you end up fairly close to the entrance of Nan Lian / railway station, almost completing a big loop."

But after the morning visit to the Hong Kong Museum of Art (recommended for the Chinese porcelain if nothing else), the sun was out to I changed our minds and we went off north to visit the Chi Lin Nunnery which sounds an odd place to visit but after reading other TA reviews our interest was aroused. It is difficult to write about this trip without running out of superlatives. First let me say that no visit to the Nunnery should be made with first going to the Nan Lian Park: this was only created a few decades ago from an area notorious for crime and nothing could be further removed from its past than this. The majesty of the bonsai, the tranquil koi in the crystal clear lake, the waterfalls (the electronic birds!), the exhibition of wooden architecture, the rock sculptures all combine to form an experience which will last a long time. I do suggest you go to the park first to \u201cunwind\u201d from the frenzy of outside life and then take the stone steps up to the Nunnery which if anything is even more tranquil. Four giant lotus pools with fountains play before the Buddahs which stare out in all their golden glory, smiling beatifically upon us poor mortals, subdued chanting voices and the gentle clang of bells add to the serene atmosphere. It\u2019s quite magical and if you don\u2019t leave feeling somewhat cleansed, you\u2019re a hard person! Highly recommended \u2013 but possibly not for childen."

After researching on attractions to visit in Hong Kong, the Nunnery always came up highly recommended, so I decided to pay it a visit, and I am so glad I did! First of all, the Nunnery is very easy to find, getting off at Diamond Hill MRT station and through the shopping mall it's then signposted. As soon as I stepped into Nan Lian park which leads to the Nunnery, I felt calm. The park is well kept and offers quite a few sceneries spots such as a waterfall and the golden pagoda, and these make wonderful photo opportunities. There\u2019s large lake in the garden ground and is home to some beautiful Koi carps. I then crossed the passway which leads to the Nunnery, the temples were beautiful and Bonsai trees were interesting, and best of all, there weren\u2019t that many people there at all, we saw about 5 people in the park, and a few dotted here and there in the Nunnery, but a great escape from the crowd!Chi Lin Nunnery and Nan Lian Park is truly an oasis in the bustling city, whilst on the many occasions I stopped and admire the sceneries I had to thank the previous reviewers for recommending this place! Don't be put off if you are not religious, just go there to look at the architectures and fantastic views, you will not be disappointed. I left the park feeling calm and relaxed and even felt somewhat cleansed, a truly amazing experience!"

Architecture buffs will be wowed by the breathtaking wooden construction, not a single nail was used to build the entire structure. The bonsai specimens here are truly state-of-the-art, including some very rare techniques, eg. hanging bonsai. This, along with the adjacent Nan Lian Temple, truly transports the visitor to ancient China, there's so much to see, galleries of wooden models of other famous ancient structures in China, poetically themed gardens, beautiful teahouse overlooking a large lake with huge, colourful kois, yet everything is calm, zen-like and meditative. Abstract, very quiet traditional Chinese music and Buddhist chants wafted as we meandered through the grounds of the temple and the garden. An afternoon well-spent. We emerged in a highly relaxed state of mind, the experience stays with you for a while.I find this visit much more enriching and fulfilling than most of the other well-known temples in Hong Kong, which are rather crude compared to the highly refined aesthetic of this attraction.

We are SO glad we took their advice.We went in January 2008. We travelled by MTR from Causeway Bay to Diamond Hill. We got sidetracked after arriving at the MTR by the large shopping centre right at the exit. My daughter was dieing for a coffee, so we stopped in at Starbucks. The coffee and cake were very nice. Bought a few \"hello kitty\" items for our daughter at home then off to the Nunnery.It is only 2-3 minutes walk from the MTR. On the way past we saw the Nan Lian Gardens and thought it looked interesting. We walked up the footpath to use the road cross over and looked down on the gardens - amazing. We would look at these after the Nunnery.We were amazed by the number and size of the bonsais greeting us at the walk up to the Nunnery, they almost guide you to it. It is ABSOLUTELY beautiful. Make sure to have people in your photos, just so peple can see the scale of the place.Through an outer building and into a large rectangle with buildings on 4 sides each with an alter. The area once again in here is SO beautiful and SO peaceful. We took so many photos and I was very sorry when I took a photo of one of the buddhas, I did not see the no photos sign.We left and went down to look at the Nan Lian Gardens - we could not believe what we had stumbled onto. They are amazing. The architecture and plantings are beautiful and the golden pagoda beckoned many, many photos. Please do not miss this stop when visiting the Nunnery.We were on our way to Sai Kung, but spent so long here, that our time in Sai Kung was cut short.This was one of the highlights of our trip, not mentioned in many travel brochures but something I am so glad we found."
