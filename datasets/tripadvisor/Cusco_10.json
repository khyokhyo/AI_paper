We had a guide who explained a lot of the history but I still felt that we had barely scratched the surface. Slightly irritating are the number of people giving you the hard sell on a wide variety of tourist Bric a brac which of course they assure you are the genuine article made with their own hands. Note that the altitude can be a problem for some people but we were ok."

The cathedral and the adjacent churches are beautiful and an excellent introduction to the region's colonial architecture (i.e. baroque). And only a short walk away is the pre-Columbian art museum which is one of the best in the country. You can also walk to Koricancha, the Inca temple, now church, to savor the past. It really makes no sense to stay in places like Urubamba, Ollantaytambo or Chinceros when you have Cusco with its many attractions and incredible ambience. Make it your base and visit the small towns in the Sacred Valley during the course of a day trip. They only have so much to offer and are for the most part dull and bland. But Cusco is always interesting."

Cusco is a very pretty city full of Spanish and Inca history and beautiful buildings. the Spanish replaced traditional Inca sites with churches so they are numerous. Also the usual elaborate statues and gardens along with a smattering of street art some of which tells the history of Cusco. Clean and safe, the locals seem to have embraced tourism and if you are inclined you can have your photo taken with women in traditional dress holding a lamb that is also dresses for the occasion. Great food and entertainment in the square. The locals seem to delight in parades and having fun."

The Cathedral is also very interesting - the South American spin on European art.Note about the altitude - Cusco is at about 11K feet. I did not do well with the altitude. Cusco was the first stop, but even after 5 days at the elevated altitudes, I did not acclimate - shortness of breath with any kind of exertion, insomnia, etc. Just be aware."

This place is more about the Spanish legacy then the Incas but often you'll find small festivals passing by, dances and other celebrations NOT MADE FOR TOURISTS but rather just regular celebrations of the Cusco people. I think that's better than organized activities. You get to see the actual people from Cusco enjoying themselves, speaking their language. It's westernized so you can find North America style stores, burgers, etc. Also, you can take pictures with sheep and locals. Remember, you are a guest, and they (the locals) deserve respect so don't patronize them. I've seen lots of people disrespecting them. Please don't."

Recommend the free city tour which runs for 1.5 hrs hosted by an informative guide (who happens to take you to favoured merchants who offer discounts on tourist goods !) Thee main square in front of the Cathedral is alive in the mid/late afternoon with locals and tourists enjoying the outdoors."

It is beautiful albeit sometimes gaudy replica of the basilicas found elsewhere. Makes me unproud to have been raised Catholic, at times. However, a must see. If you go to the church during the daytime there is a charge and off-hours is no charge. One really needs to see it. I wonder...what were they thinking? God truly would want the people to benefit a bit more. (One hears there is a bit of corruption involved as well.)"

If you are interested in Inca history, archeology and architecture you find Cusco to be a city of fascination. The streets such as Triunfo angulos which runs from the main plaza (Plaza de Armas) up one of the surrounding hills is typical of many streets within Cusco. They are largely narrow streets made of cobble stones or pavers which are extremely narrow with an even narrower footpaths. If you drive, which I would not recommend unless you are a local, there is a lot of honking of horns at intersections and reversing at times on streets which are too narrow for two way traffic. The footpaths are extremely narrow and many times you will be required to stop and let people pass or breathe in when a car passes (watch out for side mirrors). The stone footpaths are very slippery so make sure you have good shoes with grip. Everywhere you go within the old district surrounding the Plaza de Armas will have Inca stonework walls. Remember that Cusco is at 3,400 metres and it is a good idea to take altitude tablets in preparation for the height as explained by our physician prior to arrival. We are both recently retired and experienced some mild conditions of altitude sickness.You will be fascinated by the markets everywhere which have superb textiles, jewellery and art work made from brass, bronze and stone.There are some close Inca structures which are extremely interesting from a historical and architectural viewpoint for a day excursion. These can be walked to if you have a reasonable level of fitness. Saqsayhuaman is about 1.5 km from the Plaza via a steep walk or 15 Sol by taxi. You will need a pass to access the historical site which is an amateur photographers dream. We acquired a 70 Sol pass which gave us access to a limlted number of sites. The pass was a day pass and available at the entrance to Saqsayhuaman. You can then catch a taxi from site to site to visit all the sites on your day pass or you can buy a dearer pass for about 120 Sol which gives you access to more sites depending on budget and time.Overall Cusco was amazing and is a good base to explore Inca history and culture. The prices for food and art were reasonable and the people very pleasant. Peru has been a great experience."

I could not even read or watch the violent way the Incas and other natives were killed and obliterated by the Spanish Conquistadors and there were present day Peruvians happily chatting away or not being too concerned, I guess history does not evoke strong feelings in everyone."

It is the historic centre of Cusco and is surrounded by the narrow streets of the old own. If you miss your hamburgers, there is a very discreet McDonalds in one of the colonial Spanish buildings fronting the square. The more traditional restaurants offer better food. It is a long way from the sea but we ate an excellant seafood ceviche, washed down with a Pisco sour in the restaurant above McDonalds near where 'Gringo Alley' meets the square. The cathedral and the accompanying church are nice to see but there are admission charges to see the Baroque religious art. Locals still gather in the square in the evenings, play with their children and young lovers walk together. School kids dance and old people sit and watch the people passing by. One corner of the square leads to the central markets and the other main streets of the city. It is the town centre."

There was plenty of activity on both days.We enjoyed snapping photos and just taking it all in! We were able to walk from our hotel on Calle San Agustin.

Well worth spending at least a couple of hours here, even just to sit and take a load off your feet while people-watching."

Don't be afraid to enter open doors, you will be welcome. Have a look, chat, share a cup of coca tea. If you are looking for nice restaurants, again, Cusco is the place to be.

There are Inca walls everywhere, some were incorporated long ago into Spanish religious buildings and some more recently into business and commercial properties. Therefore, it is not unusual to find an Inca wall within a modern restaurant. Being an old Inca settlement, Cusco attracted, Spanish settlers and so is full of churches, cathedrals and abbeys etc. Today it is the ideal base for exploring the Sacred Valley and so has developed into a modern city. However, the centre retains an a lovely feel with large open squares surrounded by stunning buildings."

Staying hydrated and drinking mate de coca will help with any altitude sickness. The Plaza de Armas is the same place that was chosen by the Incas when founding the city of Cusco. A beautiful square to walk , or sit in one of the benches to take a break , relax , take pictures, film, people watch,etc. And to watch the locals go about their daily lives. Visited the Cathedral which is the home of \"El Senor de los Temblores\" - Patron of Cusco. And the Santo Domingo Church and Monastery which is also called Coricancha. It was the main Inca Temple built in blocks of carved granite and smelted gold.There are many other churches and also San Blas which is an artistic neighborhood with views of Cusco.

The people of Cusco capitalize on this history, but they wear their pride for their country on their sleeves. They live, eat and breathe it. Speak of it will passion and share it as if they were there themselves. The art and architecture is marvelous and is definitely a wonder of the world."

I still dream about those skewers.- Horseback riding excursion: great experience for the priceCons:- lots of street vendors will make up stories to get you to buy their merchandise. You can be polite but must be firm, otherwise they may follow you.Things I wish I knew:- Make sure you have zipper pockets or it's best to just leave valuables (e.g., phone) in hotel if not needed. Anything in a regular pocket can easily be pickpocketed especially in a crowd. They basically walk behind/alongside you, and as soon as they grab your stuff they turn and disappeared in the crowd behind you, and it's very hard to push through the crowd going in the opposite direction (possible accomplices will block the way). Try not to even get into those crowded situations if possible.Overall only 1 day is all you need to explore this city. All the attractions are very average, nothing in particular stood out."

Some areas have a bit of slope, so if you have just arrived, take it easy for the first day or two or you'll really get out of breath.

The historic heart of the city is awe-inspiring, consisting of spectacular colonial buildings standing next to huge Incan ruins. It is an amazing fusion of New World and Old, and although there is a profusion of tourists, the city retains a great sense of authenticity thanks to the excellent way it is maintained and policed and the sheer scale of the architecture. We saw some spectacular sunsets from the city centre. Note that during the day, it can get hot and with all the walking you might do, be sure to take plenty of water."

The central square of Cusco is surrounded by beautiful colonial style buildings, but I have to say, it's not going to be a main event of your day. But, we were fortunate enough to have experienced the famous New Year's Eve celebration in Cusco and this central square is the epicenter of the craziness!I hear everyone from outside of Cusco travels to Cusco for the NYE and sure enough, there were so many people out partying at the square. Everyone is wearing something yellow (I was told that yellow symbolize \"Re-birth\". so it's a tradition to wear yellow underwear), sharing drinks BYOB style outside and popping fire works everywhere. And the main event of the night is off course the count down; once the clock hit midnight, everyone at the square start running around the square 12 times. It's such a fun thing to watch (bummer, I didn't get to participate in the running as we were still having dinner, but you should definitely join in!) and definitely the best NYE celebration I've ever seen!"

It is a city to walk around, to look into the orners and to discover interesting things to buy, to eat, to know. Plaza de Armas is huge and beutiful, the center of the city. Every Sunday at 10:00 AM there is a event related to the flag rise. On the other hand, there are plenty of historical attranctions such as the Cathedral, and Coricancha just a few minutes walking. It is a must to go place!!!!"

Old buildings, charming squares, quaint streets, religious buildings with rich history and character, the colorful local market, the Inca ruins over the city. It is a wonderful place to spend a couple of days or more.Cusco is high - 3,500 meters above sea level high. For those flying in from sea level, reflect on whether you may need altitude medication to soften the impact on your body until you acclimate. Don't rush your first several days. It takes a couple of days to truly acclimate and enjoy your stay."

Apart from taking a City Tour and the Surrounding Ruines, just wander arround the market places, the Artisn Quarter of San Blass and soak up all that atmosphere. After the 3 days, yes its time to move on and there is much more to be seen in the region, you will need a week in total after visiting the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu.Have a great trip.....

Its very busy and there are lots of beautiful buildings with cafes, restaurants and bars galore.It was extra special when we were there in June because there were lots of celebrations going on and there were all sorts of different events going on around the city centre every day which was great fun.It's a great place eat, drink, shop and to people watch, however there are lots of persistent vendors and people from the cafes and bars trying to sell you stuff and get you into their establishments - which is a bit annoying at times."

The area is nice, safe and there is excellent food everywhere. Where else can you get Trout Ceviche?? .... since the ocean is 500 miles away, they get fresh trout from the mountains there in the Andes ..... it is not to be missed! Yes there are a lot of people selling stuff on the streets and money exchangers....but it's still an awesome area. I recommend taking the bus tour.... it's a couple of hours long, only about 6 or 7 dollars US and they tour all around the historic center and also up on the hill side where their version of the Christ Statue is .... beautiful views down into the valley (Sacred) and gives you a good view of Cusco from high above."

Although not cheap, after you look at them for 10 minutes the cheaper offering with garish chemical dies look quite awful. The Korikancha nearby is a must visit place, to understand the great loss of the Inca civilization with its amazing stone masonry, its natural gods (sun, moon etc) and its total destruction by the Spanish barbarians."

All shops and resturant cater to tourist. Hotels and hostels charge top dollar because most tourist are rich North Americans so they charge normal USD rates. ATM there exploit tourists too in only allowing $200 USD to be drawn out at once. So when you go to pay for your Inca Trail tour in cash (which is approx $800 include tips) you have to use their ATM 5 times which they charge $5 each withdrawal. Vendors follow you around all day trying to sell you stuff, they try to manipulate your emotions by saying they need to feed their children, you get bangered constantly. I would never return to Cuzco. The only thing I liked was the sun parades in the main square. Bolivia is fantastic in comparison as it's more of a cultural experience not influenced by tourism."

On one of the routes (we spend the week with Alpaca Expeditions, fantastic, btw.

The train`s ceiling are made of glass, which makes it possible to admire the amazing view of the mountains growing before your eyes while the train goes its way down to Machu Picchu. There is a snack served in the train, and the service surprised me: they prepare a proper table for the meal, and serve you a nice assortment of local snacks, such as fruits and corn, plus dessert.It is worth the trip cost, definitely!"

I recommend stopping buy the woman selling tamales at one of the corners of Plaza de Armas. Walk through the narrow streets around San Blas and visit the rock of 12 angles. While walking remember to look up! The balconies have amazing wood work! The cathedral is impressive many things inside the cathedral are made from cedar wood and you can see the oldest (and last?) cedar tree inside the courtyard of the Hotel Monasterio, you can enter to the courtyard and chapel even if you are not staying at the hotel, just ask at the reception. Qurikancha shows the remnants of Inca ruins within the church of Santo Domingo convent. I recommend getting a tour here to understand the significance of each of the temples. It is impressive to see the Inca construction\u2026 it looks like it was made of massive stone legos! The central market (San Pedro) is also an interesting experience, especially if you want to buy local food! (I didn\u2019t try though). Finally you can go to the chocolate museum (free), where they explain the process of making chocolate... buying chocolate is expensive however it is cheaper than at the freeshop!"

The huge Plaza de Armas is the center of colonial Cusco. The square is dominated by the Cathedral and the Church of La Compania. The other two sides are lined with colonial arcades. In the center of the square is a beautiful fountain. Both churches are 'must see' sights. Guided tours are offered or you can walk through on your own. As with most churches in Peru, no photos are allowed. Both churches are a maze of elaborate altars and statues covered in gold, silver and gem stones. Impressive art works line the walls. Be sure to see the Zapata Last Supper and the Monroy painting of the Cusco earthquake of 1650. Climb the bell tower of La Compania for an impressive view of the Cathedral and the Plaza. The Plaza is beautifully illuminated at night. A video of the Plaza and churches can be found on my youtube channel: youtube.com/c/donstailey"

Almost every day, there was something going on in the city with traditional music or modern and people wearing traditional or special costumes. On June 23th there was a defile that was for over 4 hours long. All in music, dance and so colorful that it was difficult to stop watching.There are a lot of police presence so you can feel save even when alone.What I dislike is the overwhelming sollicitation by street vendors. At every door, you have someone who is trying to sell you something which is the same from one to another one. The number of dogs. Most of them belong to someone but they let them out all day and they feed on garbages. It is quite disturbing to see 10 dogs opening and spreading all the garbage around."

Every street is magical and has something to offer. There is so much preserved history here, you can lose track of time. We went into as many museums as we could with our museum pass, Although the museums are all fairly small they each have something different to offer. There are many pedestrianised streets and our kids loved the place. Easy to walk about for hours, with many good places to eat just off the main centre. Pick up a leaflet from a tour bus trip and then walk to all of the places yourself !Don't miss the mural, sun temple, cathedral, Inca museum, ruins and Christ looking over the town (get a taxi/bus there)"

At 3,400 meters above sea level, we were advised to take it easy as we found the high altitude problematic. There was much to see and so. There are numerous tours to take to see local historical sites (Tambomachay, Cristo Blanco, Sacsayhuaman, Q\u2019enko). We also took the open top red bus tour.

Never once did I feel threatened or worried about my safety, day or night. Most people stop in Cusco prior to moving on to Machu Picchu. This city is worth visiting on it's own even if you don't plan on going to Machu Picchu."

Because its most recent history and culture were shaped by two very distinct civilizations -- native Inca and western European invaders -- the city reflects a fascinating blend of art, architecture, religion and customs. The main cathedral square is indeed a key touristic center, but it's also a lovely place to relax on a park bench and take in the scenery, or find just about any kind of food you're craving.Peruvians are very welcoming to guests and a good number of them speak English, especially in service establishments. Peruvian cuisine is OUTSTANDING, and because your hotel will likely be a bargain (especially if you're traveling on US$), you should splurge on food. Taxis are safe, the airport is close to town (though you hear no airplanes once you're in town), traffic isn't a problem and the weather can be divine most of the year. Bonus: Your'e just a train ride away from Machu Picchu!RECOMMENDED READING before you go: \"The Royal Commentaries of the Incas\" by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega."

You can spend a day wondering around, admiring all the architecture, particularly the splendid earthquake resistant Inca masonry (which has repeatedly withstood the huge earthquakes which plague this part of the world far better than the more modern building techniques of the Spanish conquistadors!)There are plenty of hotels & restos in the historic centre. I'd certainly recommend that you stay in the historic centre, as close to the heart, the Plaza de Armas, as you can. I've written separate reviews about the various restos we tried out, as well as the various sights to see. If you enjoy trying out excellent local cuisine, you should try out Caf\u00e9 Morena, run by a friendly Australian, Luke, & his Peruvian wife.

There are so many places to visit that it is impossible to describe them all. Cuso is the archaeological capital of the Americas. Visit the Tempe of the Sun, The Cathedral and the Barrio e Iglesias de San Blas. Wander the tiny streets, be fascinated by the friendly locals, have a pisco sour in one of the small cafes in the Plaza de Armas and watch the world go by. We visited during Corpus Christi which is a wonderful, colourful festival when the statues of saints and virgins from churches all around the area are brought to Cusco and paraded around the Plaza de Armes. I would like to point out that you do not need to be at all religious to enjoy and appreciate this spectacular event. We booked a balcony table in a restaurant overlooking the square and sat there for hours eating, drinking and enjoying what was for us a most unusual event. Every Sunday there is a colourful parade in the Plaza de Armes. .....The military, police, local business people, school children and tiny tots all take part . It is fun to watch. Cusco is a good centre for visiting the surrounding area and for trips a bit farther afield. Take the Andean Explorer train from Cusco to Puno. It is a marvellous journey as is the train trip to Machu Picchu. We have visited Cusco three times and love the place."

The basic experience is the same, and restaurant options are many, but I advise going at least two or three blocks off the main square to shop. Prices are half as much. Somewhere towards Ccoriquancha, but up towards Carmen Bajo, there is a Fair Trade store that has all you need in alpaca goods at good prices."

The culture, the sweet people, the food, the history, the arts, the cathedrals all call us back to this place we nearly missed. The altitude was a challenge for us. One of our group, an older and perhaps frail person, ended up in the hospital. Do not take this lightly but realize that there are advance steps to take that work and that this one person was of more than 100 people in the whole group. Read and preapare for the 11,000+ feet of elevation. If you do you will meet a rare experience worth all the time and effort required to get there from and international origination. We hope to return and explore this facinating place more."

Also I knew the language and that was super helpful, so if you don't, ask for help in your hotel/hostel about local tours, there are millions of agencies, but if you look for locals, you'll get the real deal as they might have better knowledge of the Country and the city itself, they have really skilled people that will even offer you tours in english, french, portuguese, italian, and to my very own surprise even chinese , just to make an example.

Should you want to go to the large Cristo uphill arrange a taxi drive (which pays if you are not alone).Avoid the so-called factory outlets around the Cristo. They are not cheaper than shops in the city (where you can bargain: this is a must!!). If you think you have to buy something typical look out for stores of non-governmental organizations (beside the church).Bookings for excursions to Valle Sagrado or elsewhere can be made in travel shops at and around Plaza de Armas. Beware of too cheap trips to Machu Picchu (they may leave you nowhere waiting for a pickup that never arrives, although that may be funny too)"

The streets are full of restaurants, shops and adventure agency. We choose marcelo adventures because it has a great tour and the cheapest in the area. You can get tours of maras y moray for 25 soles, city tour for 15 soles, sacred valley for 25 soles and you need to buy the boleta tour to enter in some sights. If you buy the full one it will cost you 130 soles that is valid for 7 days. There is a different price for locals and for foreigners. That is the down side it is half the price for locals. The buildings are mixed of spanish and inca style houses. At night the mountains look like a bid christmas tree because of the lights from the houses. It has a breath taking view. The people who worked at the tour work together in one. It doesn't matter which tour agency they are from. They look after the tourist. The tour is in English and spanish and some circumstances it depends how many in the group they can do Japanese and Koreans well. The hotels are range from 5 star hotel to hostels. The altitude make you a little bit sick but you can always buy the altitude sickness pills. I suggest to relax on the first day and do the tours the next day to help you adjust. Overall a nice city to visit."

The historic center is charming and very walkable, there are lots of shops and many good restaurants (MAP cafe, Cicciolina, Incanto, Pachapapa, etc), museums (Inka museum and MAP- Pre Columbian Art museum), cute neighborhoods (San Blas), historical sights - Qoricancha, the main cathedral, various churchs, and the busy local market San Pedro selling everything from produce to wooly hats and sweaters. On Sunday mornings at Plaza Armas there's always (so we were told) a flag raising ceremony and celebration, with appearances by local dignitaries, little kids all dressed up in various native costumes, musicians and masked performers dancing along the cobblestoned streets, military bands, soldiers standing in formation and singing patriotic songs, very festive and energetic.

In the case of Cusco, is that break between the Incan Empire and the Spanish conquest or should some specified date be determined? The Spanish influence was strong and structures constructed in the 20th century look much like those from the 16th century. Once the Spanish took over, it seems as if change has been slowly adapted. Of course it may have been slow in the Incan times, but so much has been lost. I mention this, as it was difficult to determine just when you enter or exit the historical district of Cusco. So much looks the same of at least very similar is styles. Cobblestone streets are still being constructed in many parts of the world--they work and last a very long time.The narrow gate our bus drove through was an obvious feature, but our guide helped.

There are plenty of good restaurants surrounding the plaza as well as places to get inexpensive massages (greatly needed after two days at Machu Pichhu)."

We were just there in August, which is high season for tourism, but even so, it was unpleasant to have menus pushed in our faces on the streets, plus so many hawkers of tours, souvenirs, etc. It would be interesting to visit in low season and, hopefully, see a difference."

I suggest that you start with a free tour of the town which leaves the main square at around 11:00am. These are available in both English and Castellano. The guides are very knowledgeable and provide you with an overview of the town, that you can then explore in more depth. Cusco is a rich mixture of the traditional and the modern. Free wifi is widely available, as are cash points and credit cards are accepted in most places. Though I did not suffer from altitude sickness as such, I certainly felt the effects. Climbing countless steps every night was a killer. Next time I go, I will get accommodation nearer the square."

Bakeries, crafts, and colonial stuctures will cause you to pause every step of the way. When you are not studying history in the center, there are many treks, tours, and ruins to experience. I even joined the South American Explorers club to socialize and participate in the many educational events they offer. I have stayed in four hotels so far, all within the Puma of the historic center. I start Spanish classes next week because I plan to stay for awhile. Loving it!"

There are quite a few dogs roaming the streets which apparently aren't strays- they go home to their owners at night and stay out of your way during the day. Local cuisine includes alpaca and guinea pig which we tried once. 90% of the market shops sell the same thing so you can bargain - almost everyone walks away with an alpaca beanie and jumper. You will learn to say no gracias (no thank you in Spanish) very quickly as locals will constantly approach you selling art, massages, souvenirs and Machu Picchu tours. The people are very friendly and the town is filled with tourists. Just watch while crossing the roads as the local driving does get quite frantic!"

            "review": "What's authentic is wonderful! But beware abundant fakery.... Let me start out by saying that Cusco is fantastic, beautiful, amazing, wonderful, and a VERY worthwhile place to visit. LOVED IT. That fact remains! However, there's a lot of fakery and deception around town surrounding the indigenous culture (or what's left of it), and I sometimes found it disheartening.Some examples:- Many of the women (and men!) in the handicrafts markets PRETEND to be working on creating the \"handmade items\" right before your very eyes. Closer observation will reveal that it's a sad little pantomime, and that these vendors are not the artisans. Women will sit there stitching a very, very crude (and unnecessary) yarn border around a much more impressive woven piece that they acquired from elsewhere. Or, a woman who knows a little bit of basic knitting might be sitting there knitting on a very small, monochromatic project that looks NOTHING like the much fancier goods she is selling. Worse, a vendor will sit there and simply \"play\" with an item in such a way to make it seem that they are making it on the spot. I once saw a woman sitting with one of the ubiquitous knitted hats, teasing the pompom incessantly with a crocheting hook, as if she was \"making\" that hat. I also saw a man pounding senselessly and purposelessly on a piece of leather with a hammer as he sold tooled leather goods that he clearly did not make himself (I'm a leatherworker too, and quickly noticed this deception). Vendors will very crudely carve your name into the bottom of any artwork that is carved, at a skill level much, much lower than what was used to make the piece itself. Jewelry vendors will sit there for hours and poke their pieces around with little tools as if they actually made the pieces. Most of the time, this is all a theatrical attempt to make you think you are buying from an artisan, when you're not.- Another example of Cusco fakery: when a talented ensemble of Peruvian musicians wanders into your restaurant to play a few tunes, they will often attempt to sell you a CD as well. Do not assume that this is a CD of the wonderful ensemble you just enjoyed: in many cases, it's not, even if they tell you it is. I was very disappointed to buy 3 CD's from various different performing ensembles that were very good live, yet the CD's sounded NOTHING like the music I'd actually heard performed! In fact I later saw many of the same CD's for sale in the marketplace, causing me to doubt whether the CDs had any connection to the ensembles I had heard.- Women in indigenous dress carrying a cute little lamb, or walking a llama. You'll learn quickly that these are not surviving representatives of some local, colorful culture, but women in costume who are almost always looking for tips in exchange for taking their picture. Around Cusco, it's HIGHLY unusual to see a woman wearing colorful, native dress unless she is working for tips from tourists. Want to take their picture? Fine -- just be sure to tip them, and be aware that it's highly likely the only reason they're dressed that way in the first place is to get your tips.- \"Handmade objects\". A large majority of the \"handmade\" items for sale, particularly textiles, are actually machine woven (or knitted). Don't assume it's \"handmade\" just because the vendor tells you it is. Look around, shop around. A great majority of the items for sale in Cusco are mass produced and you'll find the same \"handmade\" item at a hundred other stands.- \"Baby Alpaca.\" Yes, there is real baby alpaca wool all over the Cusco markets, and yes, it's luxurious, but not everything marketed as \"baby alpaca\" wool actually is. Vendors know that the \"baby alpaca\" designation is attractive to buyers, but I've seen anything from regular sheep's wool to llama to even SYNTHETIC fibers on the market being touted as \"baby alpaca.\" Learn to tell the difference before buying.But all of this deception and fakery shouldn't dissuade you from going. Like I said at the beginning of this review: Cusco is fantastic, beautiful, amazing, wonderful, and a VERY worthwhile place to visit! However, oftentimes it can be a challenge to figure out what is real, and what is \"for show\"..."

            "review": "Beautiful, but more of a backpacker culture than Peruvian culture. Yes, the city center is beautiful and quaint. It's also reminded me of Disneyland: expensive with a definite tourist culture all its own. Example: there are women and children all over town dressed in traditional Quechua clothing, leading llamas or holding lambs. When you get close you can hear them repeating the words, \"Una foto por dos soles\"=a photo for 2 soles. It reminded me of having my foto taken with Cinderella at Disneyland. We found ourselves wondering where the real Per\u00fa was underneath Euro-American-Japanese backpacker populace. What follows is what my husband and I recommend if you are interested in more than just the tourist culture that pervades. 1. Don't stay in the historic center of Cusco. By all means you should visit it and see the historic sites. You can easily take a cab and spend a couple of days exploring the beautiful architecture. The historic center is hugely expensive and even catching a cab from the center is twice as expensive as catching a cab anywhere else in Cusco. I met very few Peruvians while staying there and the ones I did meet were largely interested in selling me a tourist related service or item. When we went out of the city into the suburbs we saw and met wonderful Peruvian families and got to see where they lived, worked, shopped, etc. 2. Remember that the most authentic places to eat are the places that have never even heard of TripAdvisor so they won't be on here. After a couple of days of only getting trendy recommendations from other backpackers, we finally asked a local where she eats and she recommended a small kitchen called Ranc\u00f3n del Rey (maybe Rinc\u00f3n spelled incorrectly?). We ate the plato del d\u00eda (daily special) for 6 soles and it was wonderful Peruvian food. We were the only Americans in the restaurant. 3. Ask locals where they purchase their food and visit those markets instead of the touristy San Pedro market. The market in San Sebastian is a large market in a suburb area of Cusco and there were no tourists there. They had great local food and for a fraction of the cost of San Pedro market. Also be sure to visit the Chinchero artisan market on Sunday. It's very small, but we were also the only tourists there (and in high season!)4. The cathedral in city center square is beautiful, but I was amazed to see the price to get in. We went very early in the morning one day and discovered that it is free to get in before 8am. We also discovered that if you attend mass, you (obviously) get in for free, plus you get to participate in a great cultural experience."

Cusco is often hub for travelers between Lima and Machu Picchu for agency planned tours. Try and schedule some time to explore this district - up and close. There is truth that visitors who are not accustom to the elevation (3,399 m / 11,152 ft) should not overexert themselves and take the time to acclimate. The walk through the historic district climbs up and down hills, but overall provides enough resting areas where someone can sit/stand and enjoy the local sounds, sites, and color. Locals may be walking about with their llama - be prepared to pay a couple Soles, but the cost is very worthwhile for the memory."

For this reason it is a tourist hot spot.The architecture has a strong influence from the Spanish conquistadores, and you can see how they destroyed and built on top of some amazing Inca buildings. This is something that we can learn from in many places, what a pity it is not to maintain historic cultures and buildings. What is even worse is seeing fast food restaurants nestled within the old buildings, however for many people this can give a comforting taste of home. However if you are like me and want to try local delicacies I highly recommend Ceviche and Alpaca meat - the ceviche is delicious and very healthy. As it is raw fish make sure you pay a bit more from a restaurant that looks the part or you could pay dear in the middle of the night :-( The city is pretty clean and felt safe, obviously you need to be street smart and avoid walking around at night in smaller, less busy areas - but hey thats my advise for many large cities in the world. The hostels are a bit more expensive than in other areas of Peru, but most are very clean. I stayed in Pisko and Soul in San Blas which was a great area for bars, restaurants etc. To get to Cusco I highly recommend the Cruz del Sur bus - this is by far the best bus company I travelled with in south america, on one journey I even played bingo being hosted by a very funny cross dressing attendant whilst eating jelly - an experience to remember!This is a great place to acclimatise before trekking and relax afterwards. I stopped drinking before my trek to ensure I was well hydrated before the trek. Obviously water being key to move oxygen round the body. So it was nice to sink an ice cold beer when we got back .... and a sneaky coffee too!Cusco is well worth the visit and is a great place to meet other travellers, party, relax and see the traces of Inca culture!"

The fact that the village was full of tourists from all life on earth did nothing to damper the beauty nor authenticity of the surroundings. The best time was spent sitting on a cafe balcony overlooking the town square and people watching. The various religious and other parades, the sun rise and sunset over the mountain tops and the square and village lights as darkness set. I hope to return for a longer stay next time!"

At first glance, the centre of Cusco looks a little ramshackle - but then much of the centre is a UNESCO world heritage site and presumably can't be renovated. So if you can ignore the bustling traffic, it doesn't take too much of a leap to imagine you're seeing the place much as it was when the conquistadores were in charge. What kept surprising me, initially, was how many Incan buildings still remain - or at least, the first couple of meters of their exterior walls, subsequently built on and extended by the Spanish. But then, it's easy to think of the Inca empire as ancient, while really it's just old, ending a mere 500 years ago. If this seems like a long time, consider that the Incans were contemporaneous with King Henry VIII in England and only just pre-dated Shakespeare. So on second thoughts, it shouldn't be surprising that the original Cusco was a sizeable and substantial settlement, constructed of those wonderful Incan stone buildings, and that many of these buildings survive, albeit in modified form. Today the tourist centre of Cusco is the Plaza de Armas, a large square next to the cathedral, and almost everything of interest to the casual tourist within the city itself is located within no more than 10 minutes walk of this spot. However there is much more to the historic centre than just the Plaza. Narrow streets in all directions lead past the remains of Incan / colonial dwellings, and you'll find many beautiful little courtyards hiding, Spanish-style, behind unobtrusive doorways. From nearby Sacsayhuaman, looking down onto the town from the top of a hill, the courtyard and square nature of the old town is clearly visible, and the orange / red tiling on the roofs gives almost a Roman impression. Of course, Cusco's historic centre isn't really a single attraction - almost everything worth seeing here will have its own separate Tripadvisor entry, and you would be well-advised to seek these out too. There's a surprising amount to see and do packed into a small space, particularly if your interest encompasses history, religion, museums, gastronomy, and shopping. With regards to the latter, most of the old buildings in the centre, at least at ground level, have now been converted into shops. Kuna and Sol Alpaca are probably the two most reputable places for good quality alpaca clothing, with a number of outlets on or near the Plaza de Armas. Avoid buying from the sellers wandering the Plaza itself unless you have a particular desire to wear acrylic. Allow at least 4 days to see everything including the nearby ruins of the temple complex at Sacsayhuaman, which you will need transport (or an organised tour) to get to. Some attractions require you to buy the all-in-one Cusco tourist ticket, while for others you can simply pay on the door. If you need local help organising tours or guides I highly recommend Amazonas Explorer."

Make sure you go to the market - lots of cheap things to buy and check out the farmers market - especially the butcher area - you see how they use every piece of the animal. Their food \"court\" looks wonderful - but you don't want to eat there unless you are a native. They also have an area for shamans and tarot card readers, etc. Never seen so many smoothie vendors in one place."

There are excellent museums, coffee shops, restaurants and the shopping is great, even if a bit expensive by local standards. There our outfitters in the side streets and backpacker hotels abound. It is an easy walk from here up to Sacsayhuaman on the hills overlooking the plaza. If you are looking to exchange money this may not be the best place as rates can be higher than outlying areas. Check for local festivals and celebrations in this area as they are a site to see. The costuming and dancing and music are an added treat if you timing is good."

The information we had been given was where to go, not where not to go. On the way to hotel from airport, our driver told us of a nice view overlooking the City. Day 2 we decided to hike up. On the descent we were attaced by 3 men one with a knife... do you know what an experience it is to be 2 hours from the City and having someone holding you down, with two people on your husband??? The worst thing was, after we gave themeverything we had with us, the knife man kept trying to stab my husband..... luckily he was a foot taller and got the other guy by the wrist, so damage was minimun, one puncture wound on knee, scratches and bruises. We were going to cancel trek, but have decided as it is an organised tour, we will go.The police and our tour operators have taken this very seriously, and out tour operator has promised to change info package.So,for people travelling to Cusco, Peru, organise a taxi with your hotel or tour operator ( which we did) and be very careful where you go. Eventhe landmarks of this City are not worth the experience we had today.Ps.we cannot post pictures as our cameras and mobile phones have been stolen."

I came to Cusco after a few days in Peru's capital Lima, the flight was fine, and one of the good things flying during the day is that you can admire the landscapes and mountains of one of the most beautiful countries in the world.The landing manouvering is really nice, and gives you a nice view from the city, the airplane must manouver in low altitude to land in Cusco's airport, nothing to scare about, but if you can look through the window, you are going to have and amazing view from the city and it's sorroundings.As Cusco is located about 3,400 m above the sea level, you must be aware of the problems you may face due to it, the peruviand calls it Soroche, so the recommendations you must follow as soon as you get to cusco is to drink some coca tea and go to bed and rest for about 2 or 3 hours, this is necessary for you to acclimatize with the altitude. As soon as I got to Cusco, I was feeling fine, went to my hotel, drunk some coca tea and then, after going a few steps on the stairs I felt the altitude action on my body, I've lost mey breath and got tired really fast, so I went to my bed as soon as I could to rest.One problem, my hotel was located at the top of a very steep street, so it was hard to get back to the hotel walking, I had to stop several times to try to catch my breath and rest, I had to walk very slowly, and just started to get used to it in my last day in Cusco.The architecture in Cusco is another amazing feature of the city, old spanish archtecture mixed with old inca archtecture, the churches and old building are all very detailed and with brown and characteris color.From the Plaza de Armas you can have a really nice view of these constructions, and close to it you can also see the exemple of mixed archtectures, the Qorikancha Temple, or the Temple of the Sun, build over an old inca construction stand as another eye-catching and most importante places in Cusco. Get on a tour and get it know from the inside, you will find a lot more inca construction inside it.And of Course, the night life, Cusco has an amazing night life, with plenty of pubs, restaurants, caffes and night clubs, Enjoy the local cousine of the place, like Lomo Saltado and the Cuy, there you can also find a Mcdonald's and Starbucks, but I would not recommend it, of course, the local pubs, crowded with turists and locals.I'm going to detail it on my next post about cusco.You can also check my travel videos on Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/user/ricfsSubscribe to my channel.Also visit my travel blog:http://www.tripcall.net"

It\u2019s my second time here, and we will stay about three weeks, but it\u2019s not really long enough to absorb everything that this city has to offer. Apart from all the official ruins, there are so many original Inca fountains, walls and little lane ways to admire around the city (San Blas comes to mind), as well as all the impressive colonial architecture and the beautiful plazas. The people here are also generally very sweet if you take the time to relate.On the down side, the street vendors can become annoying (best just to ignore them), almost all the clothing items for sale that they say are 100% alpaca are actually synthetic and made in China, as are most of the souvenirs. There are still authentic artefacts and fabric to be found, but they are becoming few and far between. There is an abundance of hostels, hotels, cafes and restaurants, so you should easily be able to find accommodation and food to suit your taste. (Jack\u2019s is undoubtedly the best caf\u00e9 in the mid-range space if you can get a table) There is not much available in the top end, but that\u2019s probably a good thing as it keeps prices reasonable.One could complain that it has become too touristy here, but that is only to be expected in such an archaeologically significant area that Cusco is."

Cusco deserves at least two or three days to see it all (not counting a full-day trip to Machu Picchu), and more if you want to take a walk to the hills and see Sacsayhuaman and the surrounding area. The iconic Inca sites are as striking as you imagine them to be when planning your visit, perhaps especially the Corikancha. The central squares are great places to stroll and browse, though in the evening you can get some hassle from street sellers and people trying to persuade you to try their restaurant - nothing very aggressive though, they were always polite. Many of the immediate post colonial buildings are based around courtyards and are definitely worth stepping into when you get the chance. The building housing the Machu Picchu Museum (Casa Concha) is a good example, but others house many small shops and restaurants. We were very struck by the pottery in the Museum of Pre-Colombian Art which clearly influenced early 20th Century modern artists such a Picasso, Klee, Moore and others. Your appreciation of the Spanish colonial churches will be determined your attitude to the imagery that characterises their interior art. Top tip: take the time to have an early evening beer or wine on the balcony of one of the many bars and restaurants overlooking the main square. After a long day, an hour spent 'people watching' was always a treat. Our trip was in 'the rainy season' (late December) and there were a few showery days, but we really enjoyed the more temperate weather as we wanted to get out and about without having to worry all the time about intense UV exposure at 3,500 meters. My wife had been once before (15 years ago) when it was dry and parched and preferred the green grass and mountain flowers of this time of year."

            "review": "Historic gem!. My husband Peter and I spent 3 days and nights in Cusco and easily could have spent a few more days with so much to see and do unchecked on our to do list. With the exception of catching a ride from the airport to our accommodations, we walked everywhere. The stone work on the buildings and the streets alone were spectacular sights, and architectural beauty could be found everywhere in the Spanish Colonial part of the city. (Outside central Cusco was the typical developing nation city.) The Plaza de Armas and the other plazas were always teeming with activity, so, when we needed a break from walking, we simply sat on a bench to people watch for a while. The traffic may seem absolutely crazy to some people, but drivers did one thing they rarely do in Austin, TX: use their turn signals so pedestrians at least know what's going on.We trekked up and down hills to see all the plazas, San Blas and most of the rest of the colonial section. Our trekking included worthwhile visits to Qorikancha (Quechua for \u201cGolden Courtyard\u201d), Museo de Arte Precolombino, Museo de Plantas Sagradas, and Sacsaywaman, all of which I plan to review separately. The guide books list Sacsaywaman as outside of town, but we made the steep uphill walk in less than half an hour. Plus, the views along the way were amazing, and we saw a section of town we would not otherwise have traversed. Our favorite places to dine were Victor Victoria (breakfast one morning), Aroma (in Plantas Sagradas), and Caf\u00e9 Punchay, all of which offered casual and fairly inexpensive healthy food that was vegetarian friendly. The travel guides were not exaggerating, however, in describing the incessant push from those selling tourist trinkets; however, with only one exception, a simple, \u201cNo, gracias,\u201d repeated a few times if necessary, generally stopped the sales pitch that was immediately followed by another and another and another. The one exception was a teenage girl who hurled at our backs what I\u2019m sure were expletives in Spanish, but we laughed it off and went on our way. One travel guide suggestion with which I highly disagree, specifically with regard to Cusco, is the recommendation that travelers merely use their ATM cards to get cash. Instead, I recommend bringing some cash and changing it to soles at one of a multitude of kiosks set up to do so at a reasonable rate. We never found an ATM that allowed us to take out more than 400 \u2013 450 soles (about $145.00), and each transaction cost us $10.00 ($5.00 at each end). In addition to this problem, our bank, Chase Bank, flags Peru as a high fraud risk country, so we would make a withdrawal then the second or third would place a flag on our card that required us to call the bank to tell them that the transactions were ours. Finally, one ATM ate my card, and the bank stalled us about calling the subcontractor to retrieve it. We never had any of these problems outside Cusco, though.Many travelers use Cusco as a pit stop on their way to and/or from Machu Picchu, and, by doing so, miss a lovely and friendly, albeit, frenetic, city."

Cusco's Plaza Mayor is no exception with important buildings and structures surrounding it. Among these are the Cusco Cathedral of Santo Domingo, the Jesuit Church of the Holy Spirit, the Church of Triumph, the Church of the Holy Family, and the Municipal building. at the center of the square is a statue of Pachacutec, the Incan emperor who built the Machu Picchu Lost City of the Incas.An interesting item about Cusco is its official flag, flying high atop the municipal building in Cusco's Plaza Mayor, a rainbow flag consisting of SEVEN stripes each of the color of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) except the blue and the indigo have been changed to sky blue and blue. This official flag of Cusco (symbolizing an Inca territory) is very similar to the rainbow flag used by the present gay and lesbian community world side (only SIX stripes - no sky blue stripe). This has led to a concern locally, nationally, and internationally because the similarity of the two flags could be mistakenly interpreted as a tribute to \"gay pride\".

Unaytambo where I stayed, was on the site of the former Inca palacios, the centre of the once great Inca empire. The high altitude added to the slightly surreal feel of the place.

The nights are crisp and the sparse lights on the hills surrounding this area seem almost like constellations. The streets to and from this area are quaint and historic. Just a pleasant area to walk with historic churches to visit. Plenty of restaurants and shops. Having a Starbucks right there was a nice surprise! And a great Irish bar in the area!"

Don't underestimate what the altitude can do to you- whilst I felt ok, simple walking up hill leaves you feeling a little breathless ( and I'm reasonably fit for a 50 plus person).They may give you coca leaf tea to help, but be prepared it can knock you out :0)Once you settle in its worth exploring this old town and a tour is well worth it. It has fantastic history and the trip to sexy woman ( not spelt that way) will truly blow your mind in how clever the Incas were.You'll be amazed at the amount of traffic going round and round the main square at all times ( I now detest the crappy little taxis!)If you fancy a few beers in a nice atmosphere, visit Paddy's Irish bar (highest Irish bar on the planet) in the corner of the main square for a nice atmosphere.The market is also a experience worth trying with pigs heads etc all openly displayed! All in all a fascinating place well worth experiencing"

The first impression is that this place is too touristic and you may get annoyed by all the people trying to sell you tickets to Machu Picchu, rafting, etc. or all the \"North Fake\" outlets. However, the city has a charm that you will find if you stroll along into the backstreets. You may also take a short drive to one of the nearby Inka sites or visit good museums. If you fly directly to Cusco to do the Inka trail I would advise you to spend 2-3 days in Cusco to get used to the altitude and thus avoid altitude sickness on the trail."

We visited all of the churches, walked around the three squares which make up the old town, and generally tried to fit in as much as we could. All or any of the churches or cathedral are worth a visit on their own. Together they are a sensory overload of artworks, cedar carving and speak volumes about the excesses of the Conquistadores. Many of the streets in Cusco are still lined with Inca walls, one of the best being along side the Archbishops Palace, itself built on an Inca temple utilising a lot of the original walls. For us, the jewel in the crown was Koricancha, where the Convent of Santo Domingo stands. Following an earthquake in 1950, the Spanish building collapsed, uncovering the Inca walls they had rendered over. In the rebuild, they have left the walls exposed. The quality of the stonework is beyond belief. If you go nowhere else in Cusco. go to Koricancha. Lastly, for an excellent, reasonably priced meal, go to Jacks Cafe or the Irish pub (allegedly the highest in the world). The meals are rather large and we found it best to share a main, the owners are used to it and happily provide an extra plate and cutlery. Drink plenty of coca tea and take it quietly, but if you can, spend a lot of time wandering around Cusco. You will not be disappointed."

I got very tired of saying \"No Gracias\" over and over again to street salesmen, and being harassed by beggars or locals wanting to charge me to have my picture taken with them."

Cusco is a city of beautiful churches and your should visit the Cathedral on the main square. Not to put to fine a point on it, but the Inca statute on the main square is not so bad. The locals are very proud of their Inca ancestors. Cusco has several fine hotels and restaurants. There are fine shops along with those selling tourist mementos. Cusco is much less populated than Lima (500,000 vs. 9 million) and was sunny during our visit and not as gloomy as Lima was. You can catch a train to Machu Picchu from Cusco, although our group took it from Ollantaytambo. We think Cusco is a must if you are visiting Peru."

I waited and waited, and finally on the 13th of August (almost 1 month later) I got an email with a reservation number that was invalid (obviously not paid for) and a letter saying I could show this at the park (not true). I immediately tried to call cuscocity.com (number was no longer in service) and e-mailed them with the problem, requesting a valid number so I could print out my tickets on the official www.machupicchu.gob.pe website (the only way to verify these are valid). I got no response. A day later, after reading some very scary reviews of this company I e-mailed them again requesting valid ticket information must be sent to me no later than 14 August or I wanted my order cancelled and would dispute charges with visa and paypal. I received a very nasty e-mail back from Ed. However, by noon on the 14th of August I finally received an e-mail with the correct number and was able to print my tickets off the official site. So all's well that ends well, but it is a shame that a threat is the only thing that prompted some action and that I had to wait a month for something that shouldn't have taken more than 1 day. I wouldn't recommend or use this site again."

However some locals keen to rip off the tourists - like taxi driver agreeing on 10 soles for a ride but not refusing to give change on a twenty 20 soles note, Alpaca foto ladies in authentic dress demanding as much as 10 soles per head for a couple of photos etc. Quite a contrast with Arequipa and Puno where the atmosphere is much friendlier."

The pace is nice and slow and Cusco is a wonderful place to discover for a day or 2. There are plenty of interesting churches and historic buildings and a great market discover new fruits and other local delicacies. Also everything can be done on foot. Cusco is also a very nice base to discover the various Inca sites and sacred valley. All in all a highlight on any visit to Peru."

There are LOTS of vendors trying to sell you stuff, but just ignore. They`re harmless. My husband and I took Diamox for altitude sickness days prior to the our Cusco trip when we were in Lima, and we did just fine. You do have to take it easy on your first day there as we did see MANY foreigners with oxygen masks at our hotel and half of them looked hung over. Getting to Cusco city center from the airport is relatively cheap. Probably around 20 soles. Don`t pay over 25. Once you get out of the airport, pass the people with the signs, you\u00b4ll be able to get a taxi. They say to only get the taxi with a radio sign on top....We did just fine with taxis with some sort of legit sign on top. We stayed at the Casa Andina Private collection in town (Excellent choice - highly recommended), and took it easy on the first day. Basically found the ministerio de cultura by our hotel near Av. Huascar; bought our machu entrance tickets. We ended up purchasing the package which included hiking up machu picchu mountain - $142 soles/ person. We purchased perurail tickets ahead of time in the states. Keep in mind when you go, don`t be surprised if they do a bimodal service where they have you take a bus from wanchaq station in cusco to panchar, then hook on the perurail there for the rest of your trip. We walked around the square, admired buildings, people watched, of course had a beer at the highest irish pub in the world, paddy\u00b4s pub, then took a NAP! Next day was machu picchu and prepare yourself to get to the station by 5:45am for the trip. MP will be in another review, but will worth the trip. We had one more day in Cusco after MP so we decided again to take it easy as MP mountain kicked our butts. Took a class at the chocolate museum. It was really really cool. for $70 soles /person, you get a two hour class where they teach you all about the origin of the cacao plant, and you go through almost the entire process of making your own chocolate which you get to keep. VERY worth it. The old city charm of Cusco definitely wins over Lima."

We spent nearly a full day interviewing 8 different tour operators all across Cusco, with only a few blubs from a Lonely Planet book and a friend's recommendation from 4 years ago about an exceptional jungle guide named \"Rider\" to guide our search. The last tour operator with whom we spoke was BioAndean Expeditions, and coincidentally that exceptional jungle guide that our friend recommended to us turned out to be the owner of the company.What set BioAndean Expeditions apart from the other tour operators was their apparent honesty. They were very clear about pointing out the strengths & weaknesses of the various tour they offer (ie, which tours had the higher probability of seeing certain types of animals). Some other operators seemed to promise only the best outcomes for animal sightings (ie, Jaguar, tapir, capuchin monkey), whereas BioAndean specifically pointed out on a map where certain species were more or less likely to be seen. Besides their honesty, another thing that set BioAndean Expeditions apart from the other operators was that this was the first time speaking to an experienced jungle guide in the office; the other operators seem to only have sales people or bookkeepers available to answer questions about their tours, and who have clearly never led tour groups in the jungle. We booked a 5D/4N trip to Manu National Park, but the following week and within 24 hours of our departure BioAndean advised us that, despite being in the dry season, a sudden rain storm had damaged the main road leading into the park. In their words, \"...the road may be cleared by tomorrow, but I'm hesitant to send you because if it's not open you could spend days stuck there, and instead of exploring the jungle you'd be worrying about how much time and money you've wasted.\" They offered to immediately refund our full deposit is cash, or setup a last-minute tour operated by a different company near Puerto Maldonado, an area of the amazon which hadn't experienced any rains. We let them setup the other tour in Puerto Maldonado, and we were glad we went, because it turned out to far exceed our expectations. Even though we didn't go on a tour operated by BioAndean Expeditions, I still appreciate their honesty and diligence setting up an alternative for us. I also do not write many TripAdvisor reviews, but I felt like going out of my way to write a review about BioAndean Expeditions. If you want a tour operator who will deal with you honestly, give them a try."

Cusco is a beautiful, historic and most interesting city and deserves at least a four or five day visit (I could stay much longer). I recommend taking the double decker tour bus on the first day - to get oriented to the city. One can easily spend several days exploring the historic city center, The beautiful churches, interesting museums, the Plaza de Armas, the many cobbled street and wonderful small shops and restaurants of the San Blas Area (many artisan families have small shops here,) the San Pedro market and so on. Don't miss the Center for Traditional textiles if you are interested in higher quality weavings and supporting the artists that produce them. Buy a tourist ticket, and take a guided tour of the nearby ruins. Sacsayhuaman is a huge Inca complex on the edge of the city. If you have time visit the more distant ruins of Tipon, Pikillacta and Rumicolca (interesting day tour) and Pisac is a not to be missed day tour (for the great Inca ruins overlooking the town and for the much more touristy market). The Plaza de Armas is the main plaza is surrounded by beautiful buildings and is a wonderful place to sit and people watch. If you are lucky you might be there on a festival day when the square is the site of large parades, of military and of the townspeople from various indiginous communities, dressed in their unique clothing accompanied by various bands (military and indiginous). There are several peaceful plazas in the historic center.ideal for a rest and a coffee (or coca tea) during the explorations of the city. You can walk to pretty well all the historic center areas and we felt safe everywhere, but take the usual traveller precautions There is lots of tourist police presence.Peru is so much more than just Machu Picchu!"

Few years ago under pressure of the locals the \"Z\" was tanking out of Cuzco and replaced it with a \"S\" which it sounds closer to the real name.. CUSCO! - Cusco was the most sacred religious complex built by \"Pachacutic\" who's original name was Inka Yupanki second son of Viracocha whom won the battle against the Chancas neighboring predator tribe that it had placed eyes on the growing Inka territory. By Viracocha's time the Waris were assimilated already. Viracocha was getting old, didn't want to start a war nor even to defend his dear Q'osqo and run cowardly possibly to the Sanctuary of Machupicchu or Choquequiraou where he could hide and wait there to see for the outcome of the Chanca invasion... Inca Yupanki only 19 years old decide that he will defend the City and not let it fall into the hands of the enemies. As the history goes Inca Yupanki gather an army of the most capable man from his father's army and set to destroyed the Chancas. As the tale goes... by divine intervention where to believe that the stones became soldiers helped him won the battle, killed most of the Chancas (Abancay region) letting the few survivors scape to the near by mountains and some surrendered as well. Inka Yupanki then took all the spoils of this tribe went back to Cusco to present them to his father. Viracocha humiliated believing to be scorned by his son he did the same to him, his son enraged scolding his father named himself the new Inka ruler.It was a costume amongst Inka royalty in those days that only the CAPABLE, BRAVE and WISE will take or giving the maskaypacha (Crown - Tassel). The people will rightfully accept it or not. This time Inca Yupanqui in the eyes of his people was the chosen one. He reign lasted more than 60 years. It's said that he died at the age of 84 - 94?.Pedro the Cieza the Leon compares him to Alexander the Great.After wining the Chanca invasion changes arrived. He changed his name to PACHACUTEC which it means \"The one that changes all\". As his name describes, he change all (for the best) First of all made Cusco the religious center of one of the most grandiose Empire. He established and the most organized way of governing. Most surrounding tribes after seeing Pachacutic's success and how powerful the Inkas were getting, they voluntarily adjunct to the new growing kingdom.Tupac Yupanqui his brother a great worrier and Diplomat helped him to expand the Inka Empire very quick. Both were expert Diplomats and organizers. As the history goes the Tawantinsuyo Empire was won more by diplomacy then wars... Even though great bloody wars were fought Pachacutic had establish the rules. NO killing of woman (As he believed that woman were an extension of Mother Earth = Pachamama) nor children, neither destroying or killing for pleasure, not abusing or raping (or soldiers who did it will be killed on the spot) Not taking revenge. This according to him was going to be an Empire of people and without them there couldn't be an Empire. \"We need them\" was his words. And it was. An Empire of people, immensely rich, laborious, powerful and kind since reciprocity was a way of life. Still is amongst their direct descendents and in a way to the mestizos.Pachacutic believed that people was the best treasure ever.After his death the Empire was left on the hands of his brother Tupac Yupanqui followed by Wayna Capac his son continue to the expansion to how the Spaniards founded.When the Spaniards arrived Cieza expresses how easy and clear was for them to determine whether the place or land where they were belong to the Inkas or not.It is said that Cusco being the Religious center it become a wonder to it's own people and from the four corners of the Empire they will come in journey to visit. As the people passed each other on the road the ones who were entering Cusco will bow to the ones who will be leaving believing that in the soles of their sandals carry the dust of a such great City and blessing were exchanged with each other.The Sanctity of Cusco was very deep ingrain in the Inka Culture.To this day the indigenous people who still live up on the high planes of the Andes surrounding Cusco area still come dressed with their best attires the day of the Inty Rymi to salute and honor the cradle of one of the greatest civilizations that ever existed in the world. You can easily tell who is local and who has come from afar. Because of off what I say (wrote) I believe that Q'osqo it's a vassal of a deep positive energy. When you're there, you're certainly stepping right in the center of a Spiritual Sanctuary, think about how many of the Inka people from across great distances as you just did came here to carry with them this positive energy that emanates. I bow to you, give you my blessings and carry yours."

Cusco (or Cuzco) existed before the meteoric rise of the Incas in the late 15th century as a Killke settlement, but it was totally transformed when they rose to dominance in the southern Andes. Cuzco became the Inca capital, at which point the whole centre was rebuilt in what is amongst the world's finest masonry. The central square (Plaza de Armas) is the hinge point for the town, surrounded by endless gloomy Spanish architecture built on the remains of Inca buildings. The original architecture is more visible a block or two behind the square. The whole area is under World Heritage protection and is unspoiled...although if you look closely you will spot McDonalds, Starbucks and KFC in heavy disguise. There are cafes and bars in profusion all around, and a plethora of reasonably priced hostels in Calle Suecia and elsewhere towards the west (behind the tourist information). There are also a lot of souvenir sellers, but everything is overpriced so the smart money tends to go towards the market area towards the southwest. For some reason there are endless pizzerias around the square - not terribly Peruvian, although guinea pig and the like can also be found."

Cusco is busy, the launching place for visits to Macchu Picchu, with the highest concentration of tourists. Hence, an abundance of shops to cater to tourists. The street vendors are plentiful and insistent. Try lunch or coffee in one of the second level restaurants. The view is great and the vendors usually don't venture upstairs."

But on the other hand - it definitely was better kept and orderly than many other places. It also has street vendors that are clingier than anywhere else in Peru - you could not stop or sit down for a minute without one of them targeting you. They also would just not go away after a clear no, but hang on and keep pestering you. So stepping outside the centre was sometimes relief. Still central enough, but more down to earth was plaza San Francisco and area beyond it - on Sunday the local people where gathering there for entertainment that was quite interesting to observe."

Normally a firm 'no' will stop the hassling, but it the constant bombardment is quite frustrating when trying to take in the lovely setting."

I had high expectations for Cuzco after reading online reviews and guidebooks where people talked about getting out of Lima as fast as possible and heading for the calm, beautiful city of Cuzco. Yes, Cuzco is an attractive city, and it looks magnificent from high atop the hills. But Cuzco itself is THE most touristy place I've ever been in my life.There's nothing authentic or genuine about Cuzco -- it's about as real as Las Vegas. Every storefront is either an over-priced restaurant catering to tourists, an over-priced tour company or an over-priced souvenir shop. Where are all the businesses and restaurants that must have existed 10 or 20 years ago that made this place so popular? At least when you got a touristy place like Prague or Paris or London, there's a mix of shops catering to tourists but also real shops that real locals visit. That doesn't exist in the center of Cuzco. I have no clue where the locals shop or eat, but it must be in the outlying districts.Sure, the facades of the old, long-standing buildings look cool, but when you have a Starbucks inside that building, it takes away the authenticity of what probably made Cuzco great before big businesses took it over.Really the worst part about central Cuzco is the unrelenting onslaught of touts that beg for your business. You can't walk five feet without someone jumping in front of you to sell you something or get you to come into their restaurant. We had one guy literally run full speed across the square just to show us his menu. We also had a young girl trying to sell knick knacks sit on a bench with us and not leave, persistently bugging us to buy stuff; when we said \"no gracias\" she aggressively responded \"si gracias\" and shove things at us to buy. That's right, you can't even sit on a bench for a few moments without touts harassing you. It's frustrating and suffocating. I get it, they're poorer and know that tourists have money to spend, but it's such a turnoff.Then you've got to worry about the people who charge you for services you didn't ask for. As we were walking down a street, a guy pointed out the famous 12-cut stone we were looking for. He asked a few questions like \"do you know why it has 12 stones?\" and he would provide answers. After a quick picture, we were starting to walk away when he jumped in front of us and said, \"aren't you going to pay me for my services?\" The guy told us a couple of facts we didn't ask for, but he was helpful enough, so I handed him a 1 sole tip. He looked at me insulted and stamped away. I took a 6-hour tour of the city for 15 soles, I think 1 sole for 3 minutes of his time that I didn't ask for is more than fair.We really regret staying in Cuzco for three days. You can see everything the city has to offer in a full day tour that takes you to the Cathedral, Coricancha and ruins outside of town. Even a few hours in San Blas is nice, much calmer and quieter. But the lack of authenticity and the bombardment of touts really put a damper on our experience. We had much more fun in Arequipa and Puno and the people were much nicer and genuinely friendly.I'm honestly shocked by all the positive reviews of this place because when we talked to other visitors (mainly Europeans), they were just as putoff but Cuzco as we were.I'd hate to see what the center of Cuzco will become in 10 years, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's overrun with KFC's and Chase banks and probably another Starbucks across the square."

City tour: we got to see the cathedral (1,5 hour visit), the Coricancha Temple of the Sun (1 hour visit), Sacsahuaman, Kenko, Puca-Pucara and Tambomachay. All tours start at the cathedral and take all afternoon. If you are interested in seeing al these places and learning about the details, a guided trip is the best option. To our opinion the cathedral visit was to long and detailed, Kenko/Puca-Pucara and Tambomachay are ok but would prefer Moray, Picay and Salinas over it. (booked though the Hotel Rumi Punku)2. Mountainbike tour Moray and Salinas: Definitely places to visit, not as touristy as the one\u00b4s located at 1. and to our opinion more interesting. Tour is beautiful but quite tough for those that are not used to biking/ get scared easliy. The main part of the trip is steep or rocky. But: you get the best views, go through towns and countryside that is not invaded by tourism yet. (booked throught the Hotel Rumi Punku)3. Sacred valley: We did a roundtrip one day trek from and to Ollantaytambo that was part of a 3 day tour (including Machu Picchu) booked via CAT (located in the avenida Sol). You climb from 2800 m up to 4000 and get breathtaking views of the sacred valley. Perfect for those who have not been able to get tickets for the Inca Trail or prefer to do just a one day trek. The company was very focused on safety and provided the best box lunch ever!"

There is an old woman named Sabine who sells handmade sweaters. They are most likely a combination of acrylic and alpaca, but they are handmade. She is very sweet. Then there are a few that you just have to be almost hostile with to get them away."

I know Cusco is the most visited spot in Peru, but it sort of bugs me that in the historic center, all you can find are overpriced restaurants, money changers, tour agencies and annoying women trying to sell you a massage. The parks are the nice spots to hang out and people watch but the farther out you go, the more authentic it gets. Depends on what you like I guess. The buildings are nice with nice balconies and blue doors, but look hard to find the hidden gems and you'll be happier."

You can pretty much feel the diverse history of the city and everywhere you notice the mixture of inca and spanish elements creating a unique experience. The many churches are also worth a visit as well as a simple stroll through the tiny streets of the town. The people are very friendly and attentive towards travellers. Definitely worth a longer visit!"

The central old town is a very compact area with many well preserved old buildings and streets....day and night, you will, however, be the target of large numbers of street vendors (many are young children) trying to sell you everything imaginable. They are very persistent and will trail you for blocks, you can't blame them, their family's livelihood for the day might depend on their making a sale of some souvenir or service to you...but be prepared. Its useful if you know some other language than Spanish or English, they give up more quickly."

The city center is located in a valley giving way to mountains on 3 sides. On the far end one can see the Ausangate Mountain rising up to almost 6500 meters. The city is a unique combination of Inca masonry and Spanish colonial buildings. Typical for Cusco are the colonial buildings built on top of Inca foundations. The city center boosts several churches and cathedrals as well as beautiful squares."
