It's well worth doing the group guided tours .... they are in various language groups and run throughout the day. You can book on line but we just turned up and booked at the small counter / hatch in the front. The interior and the auditorium itself are well worth seeing."

            "review": "Art Nouveau fantasy palace. We took the guided tour and enjoyed the visit greatly, although there is a relatively steep admission fee (ask about reduced prices for children and seniors). It's possible to see the hall by buying admission to a concert, which in some cases costs only a few euros more than the tour, but there are two or three reasons to pay for the guided tour:(1) You get a wealth of details from the guide you won't get on your own, and you visit lower and upper floors, so you can see it all from many angles;(2) It's best to see it during daylight, so you can appreciate the \"box of light\" effect as intended by the architect;(3) Photography (without flash) is encouraged and even facilitated during the tour, but is forbidden at performances.If you do choose to attend a performance, make sure it's in the main hall; some groups, including the resident chorale, may perform not in the main hall, but in the Petit Palau, a smaller hall that is part of the complex."

The \"Music Palace\", which you can enjoy for free outside, is a beautiful building that captures the spirit of Barcelona well. The architecture is eccentric, but not too \"Gaudi\". Ask about performances in this theatre during your stay in Barcelona. We enjoyed an absolutely wonderful Spanish guitar performance. It was unforgettable. Arrive early so you can enjoy the interior architecture before the show.If you are not able to enjoy a show, add this site to your walking tour of the city. It is in a very quaint neighbourhood of the old part of the city."

My cousin is a music teacher, so I included this stop on our itinerary, because I thought she would enjoy it. It far exceeded all of our expectations. I would go so far to say that this is a \"must see\" attraction. We purchased our tickets online, which eliminated any stress. All we had to do was show up at the appointed time. I wish we had had more days in Barcelona so we could have seen a performance as well.The outside of the building is absolutely beautiful, but the inside was even more impressive. Our tour guide was quite knowledgeable and she did a good job explaining the history of the building. As part of the tour we were taken upstairs and allowed to go out on the balcony where all the decorative columns are. You see these columns while standing on the street below, but because of the position of the building, it is hard to get good pictures of them. We were also taken into the performance area to listen to some music, not live, but it did give us an idea of what the acoustics were like. Visually, this area had so much going on you didn't know where to look first. All of it was breathtaking. I highly recommend visiting and don't forget your camera."

While over a hundred years old, it is an architectural jewel packed with figures like the muses which surround the stage, a bust of Anselm Clav\u00e9 on one side and Beethoven on the other, and natural motifs, including flowers, palms or fruits. Dominated by the organ over the stage and with a spectacular central skylight portraying the sun, the auditorium is filled with natural light. We also visited the Llu\u00eds Millet Hall, a meeting place for guests during intermission. The hall is two storeys high, with great stained glass windows decorated with floral designs, giving an extraordinary effect. Even more exceptional is the balcony which can be seen through these windows, with its double colonnade decorated with distinctive colours and ornamentation. It is well worth the hour of the tour if you don't have the benefit of attending a concert."

It makes an excellent performance space, the audience is close enough to feel really involved in the show. My only disappointment was that we went to see \u00d3pera y Flamenco and to be honest it didn't like up to expectations. Firstly we felt that given the size of the concert hall and the skill of the singers, the electronic amplification that was used was unnecessary and in fact spoiled the authenticity of the experience. Also, and this is just an entirely personal response, I felt that there was not enough story and too much stamping! I guess that is just Flamenco though!"

The building is magical and overwhelming from the inside. It is certainly the most decorated opera/concert hall I have ever seen with a truly unique interior. It is definitely worth seeing, even without going to a show.The Opera y Flamenco show itself was wonderful - an interesting combination of opera singing with Spanish singing and emotionally charged flamenco - all in a gorgeous setting. The flamenco dancers were the best I had seen in Barcelona (I have been to two other flamenco shows). When buying tickets for a show - first row on first balcony is best, followed by first rows in the lifted side areas. The floor doesn't have the best incline, so even with the most expensive tickets in the central areas, it may be difficult to see."

There was no sign of any kind on the tickets or the building to indicate that we were supposed to enter somewhere else. Luckily, we discovered the actual entrance on the west side of the building behind a long barricade in time to miss only the first piece in the 25-minute piano concert that began our tour. Things improved from there. Our tour guide, Oliver, did an excellent job of providing historical and cultural background for the Palace and explaining the symbolism of the decorative art. The tour covered the main floor of the performance hall, the foyer, and the upstairs balcony. This is a palace to Art Deco as well as to music and is well worth a visit if you care about either."

Had seen this in a guide book and it looked interesting so, after walking around outside, we booked onto the next available English tour. We were taken into an auditorium and watched about a ten minute film explaining the origins of the theatre and the raisin d'etre behind the architecture, culminating in its current use and the many famous musicians and dancers who had performed there. The guide was excellent. Just enough facts and figures and very responsive to questions. The building is breathtaking. Considering it is built within the confines of the tightly packed gothic quarter, the amount of light that floods into it is amazing. I thought that this was more beautiful than the Gaudi casas we had looked at (from the ouside) the day before. Every little detail was considered I. This building, they way the pillars made more room for the outer windows to pull in more light; the fabric on the seats in the auditorium, the sculpture of the various ladies on the walls of the stage. We were lucky enough to hear the organ - it sent a chill up my spine and I felt quite emotional listening to it and thinking of all those performers, some of ordinary people, others of famous musicians, who had graced the beautiful stage. It really is astonishing the detail and symbolism behind the building. It reminded me of the Arts and Craft movement with its mantra of beautiful but useful. It was a mixture of Art Nouveau and medievalism and the ironwork and sculpture were fantastic. It has a very olde worlde bar/cafe when you go in and a decent shop. Thank you to our guide for explaining with knowledge and humour e intricacies of this wonderful building."

I literally got goosebumps just from the wonderful effects of the lighting on the adornments behind the performers.I went back for a tour - very brief 50 minutes with some of it spent watching a video - but I loved having the opportunity to see the mosaics on the balcony up close and take pictures leisurely. The little organ concert was a nice touch.I kept finding myself walking past this building, it was a good anchor to get my bearings for walking around all the nearby attractions like the Picasso museum and Museu de Xocolata.

The decoration of the hall is stunning and worthy of a visit in its own right. It also offers an excellent booking system which enables you to see a pretty accurate picture of the view you will enjoy from your chosen seats (or just how much you WONT see from some!). It is quite a small hall with tight viewing angles so a front row seat if you are in the balconies is strongly recommended; we went with some in the Organ Galleries which offered an excellent view and didn't suffer to much from acoustic imbalance. My only real criticism is that the concert was rather pricey at 68 euro for such a short (1 hour) show. There was also no bar or refreshments inside, which wasn't ideal in the warm weather."

I purchased the tickets online and I had read that you have to exchange your print out of the reservation for tickets when you get there. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THAT! The print out is your ticket!!! There were a lot of confused tourists wondering what to do with the print out. Just stand in line and they will scan it. The Palau is truly a spectacle to see. I wonder if more people don't go to a show there just to sit in the theater and take in all the ornate and intricate sculptures, stained glass and mosaics. It's a little over the top for my taste, but definitely something to see. It appeared that the majority of the attendees were tourists. Before the performance everyone was taking photos and videos. We purchased the most expensive tickets, which I didn't think was too bad of a price, 50 euros. We were in the first row of the first balcony, and I really think it was probably the best seats in the house. The seats on the ground floor are lower than the stage which looked awful to me. I think all of the seating in all of the balconies looked pretty good. There were a few seats over the top of the stage. There were only two people sitting there-- I think it says they are obstructed view and if I remember correctly, they were pretty inexpensive--but after seeing the positioning, I don't think it looked bad for the price. I think you would see the ceiling and the theater great from there, you would just be looking down on the dancers/performers. I am glad that we chose to visit this venue and to see the intensity of the Flamenco dancers and singers. I would suggest it to anyone visiting Barcelona as a cultural experience. I didn't give it five stars because it's just not my style/taste, but it was well done and worth the visit."

Very steep price for a visit that must be guided, therefore does not go at your own pace, which presents a really beautiful space, but which is not a palace or administrative building, not an extensive and expansive tour. Still glad I saw it but they sure do take advantage of architecture lovers with this one. It's not as though their season patrons and high priced seats for shows throughout the week leave them poor and unable to maintain the facilities. It's just that you are a tourist held captive by your desire to see the tiled columns and lavish ornamentation and sparkling chandeliers of this grand music house."

From the moment you enter the building there is so much to see, so intricate and varied. The design and acoustic quality of this building which opened in 1906 is awe-inspiring.The building is in private ownership, the entry fee which includes a 1 hour guided tour, is around \u00a315 and well worth it. There is a caf\u00e9 at the entrance point of the building which is very reasonably priced, and an excellent gift shop which has something in all price ranges.A must see!"

They played a piece of music and the music was so beautiful inside this concert hall. Interestingly enough, most visitors were more focused on the stained glass window at the middle of the roof. It is so attractive! The rest of the music hall is quite beautiful as well. Where musicians play, there are several statues with orange tiles behind it.I did prefer the second floor of this concert hall. We could see everything everywhere. Quite cool!I had no idea that this edifice was over 100 years old! It was constructed between 1905 and 1908, in the Catalan Modernista style. I will never forget how beautiful this concert hall is."

The only thing that comes close to the Palau de la Musica building in beauty is the La Pedrera (Gaudi's Casa Mila). I was so glad we went on this tour."

You can book a tour & this is well worth while as you are guided into the older concert hall & shown the beautiful & ornate decor including the optical allusion of the glass dome. There is also a recording that's played during the tour highlighting the excellent acoustics. The decor is all Gaudi design & the columns encapsulate the style of broken mosaic tiles. There is a good cafe too. Recommended."

Our guide was very knowledgable and passionate about the theatre. Every place we looked there was something else to fascinate - it was so wonderful to see the imagination of one person - and that he was able to build this with the help of so many others. Everyone especially loved hearing the organ played. The chandelier/stained glass light is one of the magnificent things I've ever seen. I had seen pictures of the theatre before - but being there is worth it. One of the unexpected things being there did was to inspire us to DO what we dream of doing - the results can be breathtaking!"

He makes great use of natural light and was clearly very inspired by the natural world. The frame is metal, covered with brick, tile and mosaic and includes countless roses, an emblem of the city. It was fubded by public subscription and remains a privately ownee building. The guided tour in English lasted an hour and was worth every penny. It started with a great video and included a short organ concert. The seats are comfortable, the sight lines good and the acoustics excellent. Around 300 concerts of all types of music are presented here each year. I can see why this is in the top ten of things to do. It's a masterpiece!"

Made me feel like I was sitting in a elaborately designed jewelry box and watching the show! If you get a chance it's a must do.

We learnt this place was inspiration for Anthony Guadi to become an architect who ended up building many famous buildings and the visionary behind Park Guil and Sagrida Familia church. There is also a tour of the place during day time with short flaminco show, if we knew we would have done that during day to check off than wait till 9.30 PM at night for a 95 min. Show."

We purchased our tickets a couple of months before we made a trip. We got there early and I had time to enjoy a sangria before the show. I do wish we had also booked a guided tour as well, so that we could have learned about the theater and experienced a more \"close up\" way.The theater was comfortable and clothing for the concert was casual. Some people were dressed elegantly, some in casual button down shirts and slacks and others wearing appropriate shorts and shirts. Next time, I'll wear shorts just for comfort!The theater's mosaic roof is beautiful and you'll find yourself staring at it before the show. I took (and included in this review) photos of the roof. The flamenco show was very good and I would love to go again. There are lots of chances to see flamenco in Barcelona (and I hope to see them next time I visit) but this theater is a great way to experience it.The bottom line: Don't miss this theater! Enjoy flamenco in this lovely, comfortable theater with the beautiful mosaic roof!"

Personally if just to pay to go inside I wouldn't do it, even though it's beautiful but I felt like 15 \u20ac for taking pictures is a bit much.

Even if you're not planning to watch a performance Luis Domenech i Montaner's Palua de al Musica is one of the most amazing sites/sights of this city. It is soooo Barcelona: crazily, beautifully bonkers Modernista architecture. I wonder sometimes what on earth was in the water hereabouts that made the local architects create Barcelona's Modernista version of Art Nouveau. I bought tickets for a visiting friend as a birthday present. We saw a fabulous flamenco performance. My criticisms are that as some of the most expensive tickets in the house we actually had a slightly restricted view which was not stated when I booked and is not satisfactory at such a price. The seats were in a 'box'. Not at all what I would call a box: at more or less the same level as the stage and at a very oblique angle so our view was partially blocked by some very large speakers. Possibly the restricted sight line only applied to this show. The seats werer also just ordinary chairs and were placed so close to the rows in front that we were rather uncomfortable.However, as a bizarre 'extra', owing to this very oblique view we could see right into the wings and were afforded a view of the dancers changing costumes. To see such a glamorous dancer stripped down to her neck to thigh Spanx kind of destroyed the illusion. Whatever floats your boat, I suppose!Don't let this put you off, but do check on whether you really do have restricted views or not. Alnother point: the ushers seemed to have no more idea than we did how to get to our seats as we were sent upstairs, downstairs and all around before someone showed us to the right seats.I've still given an excellent rating because the venue is architecturally magnificent and the performance was wonderful."

We bought the tickets at the box office there for the next day's tour in English. Visiting the Palau de Musica acquainted us with a noteworthy architect who was actually one of Gaudi's teachers: Montaner.The Modernismo movement is in full evidence in this marvelous jewel box of a concert hall. Glass is the primary material we were aware of as we appreciated the luminous effect of the sun filtering throughout. The design emphasized plants and plant structures to both support and add beauty to the building. There are wonderful sculptures of muses emerging from the concert hall's walls, muses from a range of cultures. Breathtaking."

This magnificent concert hall, which is a nominated UNESCO World Heritage Site, is an artistic landmark of great beauty and a renowned music venue.Barcelona built this building in less than three years, from 1905 to 1908. It was commissioned from the architect Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner. His team included some of the foremost artists of the age, including Eusebi Arnau and Pau Gargallo, who created the sculptures, Antoni Rigalt, who made the stained glass, Llu\u00eds Bru, who designed the mosaics, and Miquel Blai, who carved the sculptural group La Can\u00e7\u00f3 (Song), on the corner of the edifice. The architect, in a modernist style, designed an innovative iron structure which made it possible to incorporate glass walls to allow more light inside the building. The floral motifs make the interior a genuine feast for the eyes, giving the Palau the aspect of a greenhouse with plants and flowers.The posterior expansion of the Palau, supervised by the architect \u00d2scar Tusquets, has made the entire exterior wall at the side visible, realizing Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner's dream.The Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana is one of the most recommended tourist attractions of Barcelona. It is possible to buy tickets for guided visits."

You'll need to take a tour to see the interior areas (other than the foyer) - it lasts about 45 minutes and the guides are well-informed and allow ample time to take pictures. Students get a reduced rate so take your student card if you have one. Following the tour we had a lovely lunch sitting in the splendid foyer - a great way to end our visit."

After that it goes upstairs. Photography = find good spots - avoid crowds - so I moved to front of the auditoriums first, the very first seat - it gives you good shots of the stage. And at this time the crowds are the back, so you have good access to front. Once the crowd moves, disperses, then you go to the extreme back and take panoramic pictures. The security staff is very finicky. They won't let the English tour people take pictures even near the exit once the Spanish tour starts."

There was also a sort of interlude when they showed of with some international pop and movie music in short clips. The percussionist used various and also used one of the loud speakers to very good effect.

We were in the second balcony up 3rd row back, seats 28 and 30. If we had been further back it would have been better I think.Amazing building - have a look around before the concert."

We saw most of the famous Gaudi buildings and this equaled or surpassed them all and yet appears to be less well known. You can only visit by booking a tour or going to a concert. It was designed by Montaner who at the time was Catalonia's best architect, just as Gaudi was at the beginning of his career. It is full of mosaics, tiles, stained glass, plaster and wood details that glorifies nature and Catatonia. It has an incredible modernist stained glass inverted dome ceiling. I highly recommend you add this venue to your tour of Barcelona."

A local Spaniard suggested I attended one. I did and I am glad I did. The voices of the Barcelona\u2019s choir, Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e1 allowed my heart to transcend into the heavens\u2026if it just for an evening. Located in C/ Palau de la M\u00fasica, 4-6, 08003 Barcelona, the building is a representation of the modernism art lineage of this active metropolitan. Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana is a music hall with a rich past history. Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner designed the jewel. It was built between 1905 and 1908. It was designed as the official home for the Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e1, Barcelona\u2019s world-renowned choir. Now, if you do not wish to listen to classical music, you can book a tour of the facility. It cost approximate 18 euros. These tours are popular so book in advance. The tours are available a week before the date. Barcelona, Spain.The music hall is gorgeous from the outside to the inner rooms. It is full of mosaics and ornate columns. It is divided in a series of room, such as the Concert Hall and the Petit Palau, and others. There are also smaller rooms that can be used for private events. Again please pay attention to the art, the columns, the colors, and the mosaics. Though it is a real place, it is full of fantasy and dreamy echoes of the days of imaginative architecture. Within the grounds, there are eatery places. For example there is a caf\u00e9 where you can buy drinks and small sandwiches for approximate 5 euros\u2019. There is a gift shop so buy a souvenir or one of the cool t-shirts the store offers. The music hall also has a market restaurant with great views to the open Palau Square. Hey maybe you can attend a concert and then enjoyed a romantic dinner in one of the modern restaurants. Afterwards you can just walk the Palau Square. Take the time to reflect in the gladness of having experiencing the exquisiteness of the hall, music, people, and food and drinks in this lively City. Or head towards Via Laietana and keep on walking\u2026you might end up in the beach. Breathe the salted air and open yourself to a sense of tranquility that comes from experiencing the power of traveling! Happy Journeys my friends."

Aside from its physical beauty, the Palau hosts some of the finest performers in the world. A few years ago on an earlier visit we were able to see world renowned pianist, Maurizio Pollini. What a rare opportunity!This year we were looking forward to seeing the group 4 Guitars. Unfortunately our incoming flight was going to arrive later than anticipated so I emailed the Palau and they kindly responded that they'd let the main usher know and he would seat us during a break in the performance. As luck would have it our flight was canceled and we did not arrive until the following day, missing the performance entirely. I emailed the Palau again and let them know of our travel issues and asked if they would refund our ticket purchase. I did not know if they would because tickets are often non-refundable. They emailed me back saying the charges had been refunded. I can't say how much this gesture was appreciated and endeared us to the Palau. We will see a performance every time we visit Barcelona and hopefully this positive review convinces fellow travelers to do so as well. The Palau is a true must-see!!"

For both performances we sat in Zona A, General Zone - Block Pit boxes Row 13; Seats 1 & 2. (35 \u20ac). These are GREAT seats - buy with confidence!! Patrons were in all matter of dress from tourist casual to evening wear. I wore black slacks and mock turtleneck pullover; my wife a skirt, blouse and dress sandals. We felt comfortable and appropriately dressed. RECOMMENDATION: Make it an evening to remember. Go early and eat dinner at the Palau - either the Restaurant Mirador del Palau or on the Terrace of the Cafe Foyer. Both are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

This modernista performance hall is breathtaking not only for its interior (and exterior) design work, but also for experiencing a performance. My wife and I stumbled upon the theater when walking the streets of Barcelona on our first day. The exterior of the building is very neat and our peeking inside through the windows was rewarded when we purchased tickets to that evening's Flamenco performance inside. The interior of the building is distinct and worth a walk, although our personal favorite part was the amazing ceiling. It's hard to describe in words the feeling of walking into this historic hall for a performance only to be wrapped inside the architectural artistry that is the Palau de la Musica Orfeo Catala. The ticket center is around the corner - the staff there are very helpful. If you can spare the time, seeing a performance inside of the theater is really a special experience."

It is a magnificent architectural structure with so may decorative elements that it is difficult to choose any to discuss. For me thought, the huge decorative skylight was particularly exciting - it combines elements of a stained glass window with a chandelier and appears depending on your angle to be concave or convex.To see it, you must book and take a tour. Our guide was a charming young woman who was very knowledgeable. The tour took about an hour. You visit the rehearsal hall and the main concert space.The Palau is owned by a Choral Society and is considered one of the central institutions of Catalan cultural life.Our visit to Barcelona was too short to allow time to attend a concert but we will not make that mistake next time."

Bought tix advance (2nd row) in advance. Was nervous this might turn out to be a low grade tourist show, but was very impressed. Cast of about 10 singers, musicians and dancers puts on a heluva Flamenco show. The two guitarists were exceptional. The 2 young female dancers were pretty good but the older gals really gave it their all. These are extremely talented, dramatic, powerful women. The young dude dancer looked a bit small after the divas but totally went for the gold with boot heels jack-hammering & sweat spraying into the stage lights. While in town I saw folks all along La Rambla & Placa de Catalunya hawking tix to this show. Well worth it if you like this sort of thing."

Arrive early and take in as much as you can of this amazing facility,2. Pay for the most expensive seats.You won't regret it."

Turns out we could have just have happily taken the cheaper top balcony seats. We were on the right side facing stage and in the front row but we often couldn't see the performers because quite a bit of action happens stage left. Anyway it didn't matter that much as the experience was a total delight. Lasted 90 minutes which was about perfect. Tip is to arrive early so you can look around before the performance starts. Normally you have to pay an admission charge."

If you love architecture, particularly of the Art Nouveau period, then this is one of the crown jewels of that style. You are required to go on a guided tour which I usually shy away from, but the tour was very good. Our guide was very knowledgable as well as amusing. He spoke English very well. At the beginning of the tour they show a short and well produced film about the history of the place, very interesting. There is plenty of time during the tour to take pictures (no flash please). When we were there they were setting up for a show so the stage had technicians setting up equipment, which was interesting in itself, it's great to see the place as a living, working performance space instead of a museum."

It was declared a world heritage site in l997.Tucked away but across from the Explore Catalanya Tourist office, so easy to locate, it offers tours for a very reasonable cost \u2013 I booked mine online. Whilst it is a Catalan Music Hall, they call it a Palace and as it is so very ornate, it could be one. From the stained glass entry with columns which used to house ticket boxes (these now at back of building), an intermission room (where patrons can go to have a break from the music!), to the 150 kg bronze light, 2,000 pieces of glass shaped like a tear drop, this theatre has 2,138 seats. The A/C was installed in the l980s (took three years) and is hidden next to roses in the ceiling.All types of music is played here as long as it is good! The organ emits amazing sound, has undergone repairs and can now record and replay, akin to old pianola of early 20th centuryThere is the Little Palace likened to a Choir Hall, plain in comparison to the big theatre, modern and underground \u2013 one side wall designed to let in natural light was outside. There is a choir school associated with the Palau. This is a must see and entry about E15."

Most tourists congregate around Gaud\u00ed's houses, his Eagrada Familia and his Park G\u00fcell, but there is more modernism in Barcelona - with less queues and less crowds, but for me even more attractive - one example is this marvellous music palace,One of the \"other\" modernist architects is Lluis Dom\u00e8nechi Montaner. He created this cheerful music palace with its muses behind the stage and with the cupola that gives natural light to the concert hall.The music palace is located in the old town (Barri Gotic). The main entry is in a small street and the second entry and cash for tickets are just a few steps from Metro station Urquinaona hidden behind narrow Carrer Ramon Mas - it is a huge brick building.The cafeteria offers excellent montaditos (bread topped with delicacies such as ham, fish, shrimps or cheese, beautfulky decorated) and more. Also a great place for a break.I will surely return to the Palau de Musica Catalana."

National and international concerts are hosted here, as they have been for over 100 years. A jewel in the crown of Barcelona, and of Catalan Art Nouveau architecture, this venue is the only Art Nouveau concert auditorium to be listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO (04/12/1977), and it continues to be an essential meeting place in the cultural and social life of Catalonia. Stepping into the breathtaking concert auditorium you become a privileged witness to some of the most spectacular architecture to be found in Barcelona. I won't attempt to describe it for you, as this is a must see for yourself. Organised historical tours can be purchased, and I advise you to pay for one, especially if you don't know anything about this historical venue. As your expert guide highlights each and every individual architectural feature, you will become lost in the passion and fervor of its designer, and you will identify with the people he built this fantastic venue for. Words alone cannot do justice, nor can a mere explanation of its architectural beauty provide you with the reality of standing in the auditorium, observing its power and feeling its splendour wash over you."

They have a variable and enterprising programme, that seems to run throughout the year, and we heard some good performances here. Considered as a piece of architecture, it is Pure Kitsch in 3-Dimensions. If you come for a concert I would advise sunglasses, so that you don't have to see the building."

We bought tickets for family concert which was the best desicion because everything was wonderful. The concert itselt was wonderful performance (group of 5 guys without any instruments - only their voiice). Although we bought the tickets mostly to see the intertior (which was gorgeous of cause) the concert was the one that makes us feel how wonderful place Barcelona really is. By the way - this concert hall has mosaic, stained glass windows which brings natural light to the hall."

For such a large concert hall, the performance still felt very intimate. The only issue we had was finding our seats before the show - some of the staff were clearly very busy but could have possibly been a little more patient with us. Having said that, we still felt welcome and were seated comfortably in time for the start of the show. Our meal at La Dol\u00e7a Herminia - a stone's throw away (review to follow) - was also very good and contributed to a very romantic evening indeed."

My main recommendation if you're planning to visit is to find a concert - which should be easy enough as they have something on a daily basis - and take the time to watch it rather than the morning tours. That's exactly what we did and it is a fantastic experience and the only way to fully appreciate one of Barcelona's most spectacular works of art."

Last night was MUSIC!! Six plus hours!! Friends gave us two tickets to a concert with a full orchestra but featured a Spanish guitar and gypsy \"squeeze box\" AND a female and Male singers. Started at 7:00, 75 minutes ran to 150 with 4+ standing ovations. That was a really good thing as I booked tickets for \"Guitarra Espanola Flamenca\", a trio of the best guitarists in Barcelona (Spain?) and a male and female dancers that started st 10:30 in the same theater. The best I have ever seen or heard!! So after 4 more encores (doubled the scheduled show time) and a meet the artists session we got back to apartment close to 2:00am. Stilled too wired to sleep!"

Being a theatre we wanted to see it alive so saw Gran Festival Flamenc de Barcelona (Flamenco dance show). The male lead was incredible and the show was nice and short - 80 mins no interval. Notably they start late (9pm) because the theatre has natural light windows. I have a feeling you might see better flamenco elsewhere as, aside from a couple brilliant dancers, it did seem a little tired. But they did use the actual theatre as the set which helped you enjoy it even more, and when it was good it was really good. If you're seeing flamenco remember to sit as close to the front downstairs - not much point if you can't see their feet!"

The hall is breathtaking. An interesting fact is that after the Palau was built the local citizens asked for this beautiful hall to be demolished- the reason was that the beauty of the hall distracted them from the actual performance so they found they were looking around rather than concentrating on the performers!"

The exterior is decorated with intriguing floral and musical symbolism but the interior is the real gem. If you enjoy art nouveau in Paris, Prague or Vienna, the you must see this entrance hall and gorgeous performance space. Because we were there at night, we missed the full splendor of the stained glass roof. Just means I have to visit again. We sat in the equivalent of the orchestra pit for a rich performance of flamenco dance, singing and guitar. Very powerful, and even though we didn't speak the language, the emotions transcended.

Make sure you go early (up to 1 hour before the performance starts) as you can take photos before and after the concert but not during the performance. Like everyone else we had a difficult time figuring out the seating chart. We sat in row 1, seats 17 and 19 on the top level (balcony). On the seating chart, this row is on the opposite end from the stage and is labeled rows 1 - 22. We loved this location as we could see the gorgeous ceiling and the full stage and the full auditorium. For a music concert, row 1 was fine. But if you are seeing a play, the bar on row 1 may partially block your view, so you might want rows 2 or 3 or higher in the balcony. We bought our tickets before we left on the trip but we didn't need to. Whether you will need to buy tickets ahead of time will depend upon who is playing. We also briefly sat in the back box of level 2 and absolutely don't recommend sitting here as you can't see the ceiling due to the overhang (on the seating chart, this is the relatively large boxes directly beneath rows 1 - 22. Rows 1 - 22 are the top level.)"

While the tour group was large, they split us up into two separate tour groups so that we all were able to hear and see everything. Beautiful facility. The brief organ playing during the tour was just a teaser. Much better to attend an event and enjoy the true beauty of the acoustics and hall."

It is a must see and probably one of the best modernist masterpieces in Barcelona.2. The tour is mediocre at best. Like in most places in Barcelona, the museum tries to justify the outrageous price by adding features that no one needs; in this case, the length of the tour was nearly an hour - which is very impressive for essentially one hall. However, to achieve this length they add a movie in the beginning that can be summarized as \"well-known artists praise the concert hall\". The guide herself gave quite a lot of interesting information, but over all the tour should have costed half and lasted 30 minutes - it would make it much more appealing."

The music hall itself was stunning and worth the visit, but the tour had 50+ people on it and the tour guides' English was better than my Spanish, but not up to the standard, I believe a tour guide should have. He also had trouble containing the group, people were wandering all over. When we were done, he said, \"now we will see the new part\", but then led us to the courtyard where the exit was. We thought there was more to come, but he just meant that the courtyard was an addition to the old building and we were standing there and finally realized the tour was over. The admission was not cheap at 18E pp, although worth it. We had purchased our tickets online and had an appointed date and time, which we liked so that we could plan our time in Barcelona, and about two days before they sent an email stating that our tour time had been cancelled and please reschedule. Fortunately, I read my email while travelling, because it would have been very annoying to show up to find they didn't expect us. We went to the ticket window when we got to Barcelona and they gave us another time, but I felt it was very unprofessional."

From the stain glass ceiling that bends and curves to the statues on the stage that are statues on the top half but fade into tile wall mosaics on the bottom. The attention to detail in the design is endless. Personally I find Catalan art nouveau/modernist architecture to be some of the most \"fun\" than any other place. There's often so much color used and this is no exception. There's also an endless use of different materials from stained glass, actual colored glass, tile mosaic, wood, statues etched in stone, wood carvings, curved wood everywhere. It's just stunning."

We were fortunate enough to see a wonderful performance of Flamenco guitar and dance. I would suggest ordering tickets online a day or more ahead.

From the outside, the building is mediocre compared to some of the other Modernist marvels in Barcelona, but once you step inside, it will take your breath away. Absolutely take a tour of the inside, even if you have to pay the extra for the guided one. Although I did not find the guide all that necessary, I would suggest paying whatever needs to be paid to see the inside of this amazing venue."

We visit BCN often and always attend a concert at the Palau, it must be one of the most beautiful venues for choral or instrumental performance in Europe.We saw a flamenco show recently and whilst great entertainment it was not the purest form of the art. However the Palau as a venue makes it a worthwhile visit and a great evening of music and then on to a late dinner (maybe not by Spanish standards).This is one of a number of fabulous venues in BCN for concerts and musical performance. It is also a great example of the Gaudi era of architecture although not designed by him."

Just sitting in the Palau with the amazing architecture and acoustics is an experience and the musical offerings are superb. We saw the Guitar Trio with Dancers and the 90 minute program was very entertaining and the two dancers had extraordinary artistry and energy - a much more subtle and lyrical performance that any other flamenco dancing I'd yet seen.On the floor plan: I was caught out by not understanding that what looked like a set of seats on the ground floor behind the main floor seating is actually a second level with the best visibility and wish we'd booked their. Visibility from the balcony seats is limited and disappointing although the acoustics are still good. My recommendation would be to book into the front rows of the first raised level that looks like being at the back of the main floor for the best visual aspect."

Other people in about the same age group as me had paid the full price. The tour commenced with a 10 minute documentary of the Palau in the modern part of the Palau and then we proceeded to the main concert hall. What a feast of colour and decoration. It was amazing. I would always return for another visit. My dream would be to go to a concert there. The acoustics are very good and our guide played some music so we could see how excellent the sound is.When I left the building one hour later, I noticed that the queues were very long, so it seems that earlier is better."

A visit to this stunning Art Nouveau Theatre is a must for every tourist and the opportunity to see Flamenco should have made for a wonderful evening. The theatre was as beautiful, as colorful, as well preserved as any place I've ever visited. A dream of tiles, glass, wood, and so ornate it was almost unbelievable. But and there has to be a but...The queue to get in, the queue for the loos [there weren't enough] didn't make for a good start. The end result was frayed nerves and pushing and shoving. No one directed us to our seats so the numerous tourists wandered about like lost sheep. Chaos was the name of the game.Once the show started the mobile phones came out. I presume most people would know filming is unacceptable in a theatre. But if they did, this made no difference. Three rows ahead, the lights from mobile phones were constantly raised high to get a better view of the action. It made concentration almost impossible. It's true one of the attendants flashed torches at them but as soon as he sat down, they'd come out again.I really think more sanctions should be applied eg they could be asked to leave,So the venue was great, the flamenco [what we saw of it] fabulous but the organisation was zilch. A real shame. They could do better."

A friendly ticket seller at a desk inside explained a concert was about to begin, and he offered us 50 percent off any seats in the house. We walked upstairs, sat in excellent seats seven rows from the stage, where we could watch a marvelous chamber orchestra and the noted Argentine Rolando Saad perform Spanish classical guitar for two hours. The largely local audience loved it, as did we, and Saad got four ovations and returned twice to play encores. If the enchanting music isn't enough, just let your mind and eyes wander around the amazing art nouveau hall, bathed in light from the skylight overhead and featuring sculptures and figurines tucked about everywhere. It's wondrous even without music, but we were very lucky."

It's too bad b/c it's hard to take a decent photo outside b/c it's so closed in. Check the website to see when English language tours are happening. The tour itself doesn't really tell you that much but it gives you access to certain rooms that you can't see if you buy a ticket for a concert. We were also lucky in that there was a performance going on so we were able to listen to the wonderful acoustics/musicians as well as appreciate the sculptures in the venue as part of the tour. If you're going to a performance here anyways, you might want to skip the tour - depends on how much more of the building you really want to see. If you visit a lot of the Gaudi buildings in Barcelona you may experience architectural fatigue (and no, this building is not by Gaudi) and I don't think the tour is a must do if you are visiting the main theatre anyways."

It is also very insulting to the Catalan culture and people after all the cultural genocide that has been taking place in Catalonia( even though I know most people are just not aware of it). It is also interesting to notice how some people compare the Palau de la musica to 'other European Opera houses'. Did you know that there is an actual Opera house in Barcelona? Palau de la musica is not an Opera house, it can't be compared to it. If you are interested in the Opera house type of event or architectural context, you should definitely visit 'El Gran Teatre del Liceu' which is our magnificent Opera. It is very discrete and difficult to notice on the outside but incredibly outstanding in the inside( more spectacular than many of the European ones) and I can guarantee you won't be diasppointed."

There's quite a lot of UNESCO Heritage Sites in Barcelona and one of its most enchanting is the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana, located at the top end of the old city. It's a modernista design, popular at the time in Barcelona. I was really excited about coming here as I've manage to book a seat in a concert featuring Spain's best guitarists.Palau de la Musica stood out in a surrounding that is already quite rich. The sculpture on the facade, the Catalan Song, just at the corner of the building greets and welcomes you to an amazing concert hall inside. The inside of the Palau is more impressive that I could imagine.I was amazed at how rich the details of the decorations are and project a different kind of richness. It\u2019s not opulent in the traditional sense, but opulent nevertheless. From the ticket counter (which is no longer in use), to its foyer and stairways, I remember my eyes couldn\u2019t stop soaking in the majesty, and even then, majesty is likely not the right word to describe it. Colourful. That was my impression. More colourful than a typical concert hall I\u2019ve been. The columns are richly detailed to look like trees, with sculptures of the music masters as well as angels giving it a touch of heaven. And when I finally take the seat in the concert hall and look out at the stain-glass windows and the brilliant stained-glass skylight, I was floored.There are likely to be hundreds of places you can go watch a Flamenco performance. But a concert at one of the world\u2019s most amazing concert hall is something else. The Palau de la Musica is a must-see but I urge you to listen closely too. Presented as part of @palaumusicacat\u2019s Maestros de la Guitarra series, the Barcelona Guitar Trio & Dance is a group of amongst the best Spanish guitarist and Flamenco dancers. World class performance at an amazing concert hall, certainly a highlight of my exploration of the Spanish culture."

We waited for our guided tour in the restaurant which gave us a feeling for the treat in store. The architect had a visitor to bring the nature of the outdoors into the building and, with lavish decorations, I think he succeeded. The highlight, naturally, was the auditorium itself with its wonderful ceiling. It seats 2000 people but the atmosphere remains intimate and the acoustics, demonstrated with a shirt recording, were amazing. We will definitely plan our next visit to Barcelona so that we can attend a concert here! Do go and see for yourself."

Overhearing conversations from other people in the queue I don't think I am the only one who feels this way. Disappointing - but do go to La Rambla and visit the Liecu opera house - for 6 euros you get a really good tour inside of the 2nd largest Opera House in Europe (only the new Opera House in Paris is bigger). I hope the Palau staff take note of the complaints and try to do something so many more visitors can enjoy the experience."

Since the price difference of the tickets was little, we opted to enjoy a concert while visiting the Palau. What a great night! We watched the Catalu\u00f1a Philharmonic perform Requiem, from Mozart. The visit was really worthwhile: the seats are very good and spacious, considering it is an historical building; the acoustic of the concert hall is excellent; the architecture is very beautiful; and the orchestra performed very well. The Palau is easily reachable by the subway (Urquinaona station) and offers a great variety of Spanish \u201ctapas\u201d at the bar on the ground floor. In that case, remember to arrive with some extra time before the concert to enjoy some nice tapas and a good glass of Spanish cava or wine.

The facade was already very beautiful with glass panel protecting the original building and the inside of the theatre was like another world altogether. The intricate details are just so enchanting to be looked at. And having a great performance inside the theatre was just a wonderful feeling.I watched Mestres de la Guitarra Espanyola there.

She told us more about the history but at this point I stopped listening because my eyes were so overwhelmed with how beautiful the stained glass ceiling was. She then took us up to the upper floor and continued to talk a bit more. Then she mentioned that we were going to hear the pipe organ. They have a computer that plays it everyday to help maintain it. It played Bach's Phantom of the Opera song. I was a band nerd. I played tuba. I'm a sucker for instrumental music anyway, but especially anything that has low bellowing notes. My boyfriend and I cried because it was so moving. I literally don't have words to describe hearing it. You don't have to be a band nerd to like a pipe organ though. I mean, they are pretty awesome instruments. That alone was worth going. So that on top of the beauty makes it a must see in Barcelona.

The modern parts are functional and include such fancies as restaurants and cafe which were beyond the original architect, Montaner's brief. His south facing facade, which doubles as the entrance to the concert auditorium is a veritable tour de force. If you like, it is where art nouveau meets Gaudi, and it is all great fun. Often overlooked, this is one of Barcelona's hidden gems. The walk from here across the Barri Gotic to the cathedral is one of the city's most interesting."

Each one has 7 chairs in graduated height, so then ones at the back are like high stools.We had perfect views of the stage and saw and heard everything clearly.Having been unsure whether our children (age 12 & 15) would appreciate going to the opera, we needn't have worried.

HistoryThe Palau de la Musica Catalana is a beautiful historic building designed by the modernist architect Lluis Domenech Montaner built around the turn of the last century. Funded in the main by public funds the building was built in an amazing three years and is a renowned music and choral performing theatre and is the beating artistic heart of Catalonian culture. It has a seating capacity of 2,146 and shows range from 10 to 300 euros\u2026performance and seating area depending.The TourTook the 3pm English tour with a polite and informative guide. After a short ten minute film she took us upstairs and showed us the balcony and reception room and then we went into the main concert hall. We were not allowed on stage but were allowed to wander about as we pleased. Our guide was knowledgeable and receptive to all questions. The concert hall area is stunning and the architectural decoration is one of the best if not the best in the world. It is simply a masterpiece of creativity and imagination with beautiful sculptures and an ornate glass ceramic inverted dome ceiling that is simply stunning. The walls, lights, organ and the whole facade of the building makes for stunning photographs.Cost and Facilities14.50 Euros, under 11\u2019s go free, family pack of 4 is 50 Euros, Student rate is 11 Euros. Wheelchair access, beautiful cafe on site (inside and outside seating). Toilets.SummaryYou only get an hour but the concert hall is stunning. The intro film is okay but no information is given out and no audio guides either. You have the guide and that is it. I loved the hall but everything else was just average to good. Throw in a brochure and free coffee maybe. 14.50 E for an hour is quite pricey. Great place though and a great visit. Love Catalonian culture!"

Concerts have sounded well when i've visited, the floors creak a little as you walk around though but there were no problems with the sound. Concerts here tend to be a small group of performers and it's best suited to this. For opera or full orchestral music check out the lyceu opera or the auditorium instead."

The building is perfect, built to a brilliant plan, wholly dedicated to a single purpose, the celebration of music. The stained glass, the reliefs and statues, the amazing ceilings, it is pure magic. You can't look round on your own, you have to go on a tour. They last an hour and start every half hour, but the tours are in different languages so you have to make sure you arrive at the right time for your language. The tour was superb, informative, friendly, good quality sound (we had little headsets so the tourguide could speak quietly when there were other events going on in the concert hall). In addition, the Palau has a lovely cafe, high quality snacks and good coffee, a sunny courtyard, superclean toilets, a well stocked shop, and a lovely restaurant. Next time we go to Barcelona we will book a concert and a table in the restaurant. It clearly is an experience not to be missed."

This is not a Gaud\u00ed building, but everywhere you look you see the same influences that must have been bouncing around Barcelona during an incredible decade or two in the early part of the 1900s. Everywhere you look there is something incredible to see, from simple staircases to the overwhelming sculptures surrounding the stage to the incredible stained glass that forms the ceiling in the main hall.

But the show was SO much more than just that. I must say that I'm not a big fan of music and I really didn't think that the Spanish guitar music would interest me too much. Wow, was I wrong. I believe that I was privileged enough to hear some of the best guitarists in the world at this performance. I was truly in awe. I have never before been totally captivated by music. It was as if I understood what music was all about for the first time in my life. It captured my attention and my heart. I cannot even put it into words. The dancers gave a tremendous performance too, but they were no longer my focus. They became an accent to the music. Their performance complemented the music and accentuated it, but it did not steal my attention away from the music. Nothing could do that. The palace itself was gorgeous, but again, that just accentuated the music. Amazing afternoon. I shall never forget it.I will give a few insights on seating however. We were a family of 6 so I thought buying 6 of the 7 seats in one of the boxes would be the best option. I think we bought the 3rd box from the stage on the left side of the stage when facing it. The location was good--I don't think I would have preferred to be the 2nd or 1st box...we were about right on distance from the stage. The problem, however, was that there was zero leg room for the 3 of us seated across the front. I am talking DEAD legs at the end of the concert. I had pins and needles. The view was unobstructed, yes, since I was up front...but oh how cramped! And I am 5'2\" with short legs. I can usually sit comfortably in any seat--even in economy airplane seats. The others behind me were not much better off...they were having to angle their seats in order to see. The last person in the box had the worst view, having to see over all the people in box 1 and 2 plus see over our own group.If I had to do it again, I think I would have preferred to buy 3 seats in the front of our box and 3 seats in either box 2 or 4, also across the front. Yes, they still would have been uncomfortable, but the view was so great.Honestly, the view from the upper level in the back would have been very nice too. There were no seats available there when we searched. I would not want to sit on the floor level too close to the stage. That would be the worst. I'd say you need to be about 6 rows back or more if you are on the floor level. We did this show in lieu of a tour. In hindsight I wish I had purchased both the show and a tour. We DID see the venue during the show, but honestly we were not able to really appreciate it as much as we would have with a tour. After the performance we exited to the floor and took some photos of the dome. After about 10 mins the ushers came in and urged everyone out the doors, as they closed up the venue. Go. See the amazing show. Also sign up for the tour. I think you will enjoy having more time to see the venue that way. I will qualify this by saying that I was not able to tour the venue, as we left Barcelona the next day and I did not have time. Oh, and no photography is permitted during the performance. Afterwards, yes. The dancers and guitarists will pose with you in the lobby for a photo. And their CDs are for sale there...credit cards accepted."

But the seats in the Palau were ridiculously squeezed. My 1,69m tall wife could not move her legs at all, and I had to watch it with my legs all twisted up to the seat on my side.

The building itself is architecturally very interesting and a fine example of Barcelona modernism (same period/style/movement as Gaudi). However, it is situated in a place where it is hard to admire it from the outside.There are only organized group tours conducted in different languages (ending at 3pm). So look up the time slots ahead of time online and book early, especially if you are traveling during a high tourist season. The tour is some 50 minutes long. It starts with a short promotional movie, followed by a visit to a dull lobby and then finally the main performance hall. The style is unique and interesting, but the tour is too long and it sort of drags on and on....and most of the info we got from the video anyways. The building is owned by a private foundation and tickets are 18 EUR per person, which I found a bit steep considering what we saw (this IS Vatican level prices...). Still it is a main Barcelona sight and has some interesting architectural features to show. However, if your time is short and the weather is nice I would not put it on my short list."

Many come to Barca to see the works of modernist architect Antini Gaudi, But this building is also made by a modernist architect: Llu\u00eds Domenech i Montaner. He is one of the architects who stood -like Gaudi- at the base of the Catalan modernism.Construction began later than for instance casa Batllo or Mila: in 1905 and was completed in 1908. He designed it for a group of music-loving Catalan textile industrialists, organized into a community choir, Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0.The exterior walls are of red brick, supported by columns, which are decorated with mosaics as well as the facade. It is beautyfull to see that he used a very common constructionmaterial like red brick in such different and artistic way.Like most modernists, Comenech used different styles and materials in his design, making it a bit chaotic.At the corner hangs a beautyfull sculpture by Miquel Blay, called the Catalan National Anthem. Furthermore, there are top of the fa\u00e7ade three busts of Palestrina, Bach and Beethoven. The building has large windows and an inverted stained-glass dome, providing the hall of natural light, a first for Europe."

In a city that abounds in Catalan modernista the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana stands out in a crowded part of old Barcelona. The building is stunningly beautiful with charming aesthetics and daring architectural features.The modernista movement essentially lays heavy emphasis on curves rather than the conventional straight line, and design shapes that seem to breathe a life of their own. There are with generous dollops of quaint floral and organic motifs and designs in its wondrous hall. Everywhere. The vestibule ceiling for instance, dazzles visitors with its colorful, glittery ceramic moldings. The whole set has you gob-smacked, in child-like wonder.For over a century this building and the musical concerts and theatre in it have fascinated aficionadas of the performing arts and equally architects/interior designers. Celebrated names in orchestras and conductors, choirs, bands, composers and musical artists such as Anoushka Shankar, Norah Jones, Oscar Peterson, Woody Allen, Keith Jarrett, and Ella Fitzgerald have graced the wooden platform and delighted audiences here.As such definitely worth a visit when in Barcelona. Make sure to do both the theatre and to take in the building. Due to paucity of time we could only see the exterior/interior of the Palace on a neatly organized guided tour. We understand that tickets (a tad pricey from the notice that we have on hand) are being sold for a symphonic concert of the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 choral film music scheduled in the coming February. Despite the cost, that performance in the grand ornately decorated hall alone seems to be a good time to plan a visit to the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalan. May the force be with you, friend!"

Although the guided tour is quite expensive (18 euros per person for an hour), it's the only way to see this stunning venue without attending a performance. The tour was excellent, very informative, and the guide Miguel spoke perfect English. There were plenty of opportunities to take pictures of the incredible interior. For anyone interested in modernisme/art nouveau, this is well worth a visit. In our view, this was the most impressive buildings we've seen. Tours happen every half an hour from 10am in various languages, and you can buy them online or at the box office. The Palau is very close to Plaza Catalunya, so easy to get to."

OMG! it is the only word I can use to sum it all up. I was lucky that they have a show at 5pm and I managed to get one of the best seat (solo traveller so it helps). Beautiful performance, beautiful building both inside and out. I am happy to miss out Gaudi but I won't miss this out. Even Lieu Opera House cannot be compared to Palau de la Musica Catalana! I paid 35 EURO for a flamenco show, somewhere in the Gothic Centre near Picaso Museum you pay about 25 EURO for a show. I rather pay extra 10 EURO to watch a show in a UNESCO World Heritage protected building."

The music was phenomenal, as was the sound of the theater. We are not spanish speakers, but the words were translated in the program. And Silent Night, Gloria, and Ave Maria in any language is beautiful! We were able to wander around and look at the magnificent building (which hides in a side alley!) and we chose to do this at a concert instead of in a tour. It was awesome to see the local people cheering on their young ones in the choir and then a very moving tribute to their Catalan region.

Unfortunately the performance was dissapointing. It felt more like a tourist trap than an artistic experience. The performers were enhanced by amplificators... poorly, with background buzzing noise. The arrangements were poorly made and the performers - not aptly called \"Guitar kings\" - made mistakes to a level that is not acceptable for professional musicians. All for 30\u20ac...Regardless of the performance, this neo baroque concert hall with its exhuberant sculptures is a true work of art to behold."

Having paid in advance through www and coming with the only possible document (receipt) required still inside information in order to get in. We were queueing in three different places until we were correctly informed that we must go to the ticket office which is located in the new part of the building (west).We were listening to a group of very skilled acoustic guitar players. However, they used electric amplification, which resulted to significantly inferior listening experience than a real unplugged concert.

I'm not judging the skills of performers (have no expertise to do so), but I can not understand letting people in 10-15-20 minutes after start, especially given the creaky floors. Also letting in small children of less than 10 years (in some cases 5 years!) to the adult performances (e.g. Nosferatu, Flamenco) is very strange and leads, basically, to irritating both all the people around and, which is even more important, the children themselves!

The tour was really interesting with a lot of historical detail. Although not designed by Gaudi it is nevertheless a beautiful example of moderniste architecture by one of his peers. Its most famous feature is the stunning stained glass skylight which was installed by the architect to allow natural light into the auditorium since the building at the time was constructed in a narrow space between two other buildings. Although I didn't go to a show or concert, it was actually well worth the daytime visit."

We were pleased when the performance was over and we could escape, at least we stayed to the end people started to walk out after 20 minutes because of the view.

As with most sites in this great city, the modernista style had been elevated to a high art. The building front is impressive, but the interior is much worth the 18 euros/person guided tour price. Unfortunately, English guided tours, which should be many, are few. Maybe it is the Catalan pride at work. We settled for a Catalan guide, since we could not wait 2 hours for the next English guide. Our guied was very nice, knowledgeable and accommodating translating key words to Spanish and Italian.The interiors is so rich with detail that you will be totally entertained.Somethings I did not like were, the modern glass addition to the original building as well as poor signage to get to the ticket office and entrance."

Although this was our 4th trip to Barcelona, we had only seen the Palau from its very impressive outside. What a treat it was to be guided around the inside. It is hard to describe just how ornate this building is. Every surface is beautifully decorated but you never feel overwhelmed by the decoration, you just feel amazed that any building could be so lavishly presented. A musical palace is most certainly what this building is. We were so very, very pleased that we visited this building. Our guide was friendly, professional and obviously very knowledgeable. Unfortunately, we cannot remember her name but she wore white rimmed glasses! Her talk was very interesting and invaluable if you want to understand the origins and history of this magnificent venue.On our next trip to Barcelona, I am going to make very sure that we book a concert (even if we have to time our trip around their programme!) so that we may experience the Palau in the way it was intended."

Designed by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner in the Catalan modernista style, this concert hall surrounds you with impressive sculpture, glasswork and mosaics as you enjoy the performance. Worth a visit just to see the design and ornamentation, even if there is no show. Properly sized, as well, small enough that our balcony seats offered a great view, but large enough that there is space in the aisles and a fair amount of legroom. It has a large bar on the ground floor for pre-show drinks, and thankfully does not allow food and drink in the performance hall. Tickets go very quickly, though, so if you\u2019re planning a trip to Barcelona be sure to check their web site early in the process. We purchased nine months ahead, and balcony seats were the only ones available."

The building is magnificent, another true gem of the Barcelona Modernisme movement. Beautiful ironwork, tilework, woodwork, stained glass, sculpture, rampant symbolism, etc. All built initially to house the wildly-popular chorale of the day; the history of which is touched upon during the tour. We were able to visit the main areas of the building, including a brief visit into the balcony seats to view the stage and auditorium space -- the real show-stopper of the building -- however, a rehearsal was underway on-stage, so I'm not sure if we would have been given more time there, otherwise; I would have liked more time there, to soak it up and to take more photographs.The guide was knowledgeable, although with a pronounced, heavy Spanish accent (of course!) which sometimes made her harder to understand. Still, as a tour guide myself, I felt it was a very good guided tour. (Marred only by a handful of inconsiderate tourists, who constantly disobeyed the guide, by talking when she was talking, by going back into rooms we'd just exited, etc.)A cafe, and a separate restaurant area available on site, though I didn't get to sample them on this visit. A small gift shop is offered as well. Tour tickets can be purchased online in advance, or at the site. Note that specific-language tours (such as in-English) are only offered at certain times of the day, so plan carefully."

We were absolutely enchanted by the fa\u00e7ade as we walked past every day, so we made a special point of touring the interior one afternoon. Very happy we did so.The Palau is quite literally a \"jewel box\", with spectacular decorative glass and woodwork. The ceiling is especially amazing. I wish we'd been able to attend a performance, though we were treated to a short demonstration of the acoustics during our tour.Highly recommend the tour.

Built as a concert hall for middle class patrons at the beginning of the last century it is a celebration of the creative spirit and a must stop during a stay in Barcelona. I booked us tickets to see a Flamenco performance which was our first experience and after the lights came up and the crowd offered a standing ovation I was hooked on Famenco. Modernismo and Barcelona.The venue is beyond description with an amazing entrance with stained glass panels and art nouveau women overhead inviting you into the space. The interior of the auditorium was an assault of color and drama with winged horses, muses and a sensational stained glass ceiling that took up the entire center. The \"palau\" is very intimate and so the space becomes very interactive with the audience. I would highly recommend a performance--no matter what the genre, as I am sure it will leave you breathless.We stayed after the performance and just sat as we wanted to remember every detail of the performance and the venue. Don't miss it!!!!"

We decided to get tickets for a performance rather than just do a tour, although that showed up one shortcoming.Tucked down a side street off Via Laietana and not far from Placa de Catalunya, this truly is a palace of ornate features. By day the exterior sparkles and lets in sunlight through stained glass windows. The foyer and bar, staircases and ultimately the concert hall are extravagant in their decoration with the unbelievable inverted stained glass ceiling the star of the show. By day the sun, by night lighting streams through to illuminate the hall.The photos barely do it justice.We saw an Opera y Flamenco performance from the back middle of the circle - the second-most expensive seats at \u20ac35; the next was \u20ac49. Here lies the drawback. The performance was at the front of the stage - 3 musicians, 2 singers, four principal dancers/singers. From our position, the rake of the seats was not enough to see their feet most of the time - for dance that was quite relevant. Inevitably this was worsened by a tall person with bouffant hair in front of us. So we had to lean this way and that, craning to see. A number of others must have had similar problems as they stood for most of the 90 minute performance. To an extent the dance element was more heat than light to us - a lot of stamping, clapping, flouncing and posturing to tell the love story - That is not to say it wasn't an enjoyable spectacle but the poor view rather spoiled the evening.However, nothing can take away the impression of the architecture throughout."

If you do attend a concert, you will be stunned by the acoustics -- the guitars sounded as if we were sitting on stage with the musicians. If you buy tickets, the online chart is a bit confusing, we bought in the second set of seats, which we thought were elevated but in reality are the equivalent of rear orchestra seats at a US theater.

We knew the hall had elaborate design details and fine acoustics. We thought instead of touring the facility during the day it would be fun to see a performance. Unfortunately we wasted good money for an amateur poorly amplified tourist show.The dance was ok, but the singing bordered on absurd to truly horrible. As an added insult the lead female kept fidgeting with her microphone, which should have been taped to her face, but something was wrong. This meant her hand was in front of her face. An awful evening in a magnificent hall. I gave it 4 stars because of the venue, the performance would be minus three if possible."

My husband and I have attended two performances at the Palau over the past couple of years, the most recent of which was the Guitar Trio and two flamenco dancers on October 12, 2015. First, I must reinforce what so many other reviewers have already noted: this is a gorgeous music venue. If you are in Barcelona I would highly recommend putting it on your itinerary not only to see but to experience. The performance that we saw/heard was truly magical. The guitar music was so good; as I write this review I am listening to the cds that I purchased after the show. And, the two dancers were simply awesome. There is a nice bar area at the entrance to have a drink and light snack before the performance. One tip would be to get there early as seating is a bit limited around the bar area. We love Barcelona, and the Palau is one of the reasons why."

Don't just go for the tour of the building, though it is amazing architecturally, inside and out, and well worth just seeing. If you love or even like classical music, plan your visit around attending a concert here. I heard a (unknown to me) orchestra here and was stunned. To begin with, the hall is small by modern standards, so even the last row here is probably the center of a modern hall/ So, literally everyone is almost on top of the stage. And, since the stage is also smaller then the new halls, the orchestra is smaller to compensate. Of course, being so close you occasionally here the foot scrape from stage or a bow hitting a music stand, and sometimes because of the lack of distance one section or the orchestra seems to temporarily overwhelm another section, but these problems are so small compared to the overall experience.I have subscriptions to Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center but I think this experience, this proximity to the music, must have been how people heard this music when it was first written.The Palau is centrally located in the tourist area so wherever you are staying in Barcelona you are only a short walk away. I would say for someone who appreciates classical music, to not attend a concert here would be like coming to Barcelona and not seeing the Sagrada Familia or a Guadi house."

The real McCoy and so talented. Not a castanet insight as their feet went at such speed they made the sound! Highly reccome d this show if you can get to it. Singing acquired taste....

The tour is about 1 hour and it was a great way to add a break in from the heavy walking (we were on a cruise and only had about 7 hours to visit Barcelona). There was A/C and the option to sit. The guides spoke English very well and provided some interesting history of the building. They were very friendly and professional. Going inside the concert hall for the first time was very overwhelming with all of the awesome details! It truly is a gorgeous building with mosaics, stained glass, and well-detailed pillars. It was amazing just being able to sit and admire the room. Although this is one of the newer buildings within the city, it truly is a stunning architecture. The cost was a little pricey, but in the end, it was worth it."

This place is an art nouveau (Catalan modernism) masterpiece, built over 100 years ago as a place for \"the people's music.\" It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Everywhere you look is a feast for the eyes, but the primary purpose is to delight the ears through its incredible acoustics and to encourage people to make music and enjoy music. We sadly were unable to attend a performance and had to settle for a tour. Each tour (which lasts about an hour) is limited in size; it does involve climbing several flights of stairs, but I saw an elevator so that might not be an issue if stairs are a problem for you. You should book your tour online for the language you desire. If you wait to buy at the ticket window, the specific time you want may not be available. Although there is a senior discount available, it's not available online; I emailed the Palau de la Musica about the discount, and was offered it, but you had to submit your credit card information through regular email, not through a secure site.You can go in the gorgeous lobby area for free, or you could choose to eat at the restaurant in lovely surroundings without choosing to take a tour. There is a rotating menu for the restaurant, and the lunch is about 15 euros. Although you do not get to see the whole building, the tour takes you to the area with the higher priced seats and then upstairs to the cheaper seats. The building was designed in a special way so that it is a concert hall filled with natural light. It's a breathtaking building, and you are given a taste of the acoustics from hearing what the organ sounds like. I can't recall the seating capacity, but the feel is small and intimate and close to the performance; it's not like being in a gigantic music venue like some of today's concerts. Believe it or not, you aren't forced to exit the building by going through its small gift shop! They did pass out a discount coupon as the tour ended (I'm not sure, but I think it was 10% off if you spent 50 euros). We got several CD's of musical performances that had been held at Palau de la Musica and a couple of other things that seemed reasonably priced. The entry price is 18 euros, which seems steep to me for an hour's tour, but this is a unique place and I am very glad I went. If I had planned things better, I would have considered going there for a meal and then having the tour right after."

It was amazing everything, walls decoration, cool chandeliers!We also enjoyed a Flamenco Gala Show, the acoustic of this theatre is great and the show itself was fantastic.Worth a visit (15EUR/person); Flamenco event costs from 12 to 48EUR.Additionally we suggest to dinner at \"Tosca Tapas y Vino\" to close your night (just in front of the \"Palau de la Musica Catalana\"."

Our family of 6 booked this tour online(needed to print tickets out which was very inconvenient and unlike the other attractions we visited in Barcelona which could be scanned from phone) the night before. We booked with an English guide. It was 114 Euro total. It was quite a large group(about 70) that split in to two after viewing the short film. The guide was ok...she seems to spend a large time emphasising that this theatre was built for the poor and often repeated facts several times. There was a rehearsal for an evening concert going on and we missed being able to listen and watch(which she said we would be able to do) because she spent ages talking about things she had already talked about. We did like being able to see inside a building that wasn't Gaudi's but next time we would try and see if we could book a performance and see it that way so as to avoid the need for the guided tour."

The venue is stunning and this was a great way to experience it. We sat on the main floor in the 8th row, center. These were good seats, although I would not recommend being any closer to the stage. Now that I have seen the venue, I would recommend the seats located on the lower level around the perimeter. These seats are similar to box seats and situated slightly higher than the seats on the ground floor. If unable to attend a concert, the building is worth seeing."

You can get a guided tour (packaged opinions only, sorry, no wandering about to come to your own conclusions) or you can buy tickets to a performance, arrive early and gauck at the wonderful concert hall on your own. If you're fortunate, you might be in town for a real performance by some of the well know musicians that come there and you might be lucky enough to snag some tickets. Otherwise, you're stuck with one of the stock fillers such as \"Flamenco & Opera\". These are mediocre repedatives that are designed to put tourist bums in the seats. The performers are tired of doing these and it shows. Sorry, but the reviewers raving about these don't know what they are talking about. At any performance, you should be very careful in choosing you seats. There is much talk of the superior acoustics in the Palau, but this is not a universally held opinion. While the guides will tell you they are marvellous, some orchestras & performers have complained about the acoustics. Also, some seats make it almost impossible to see the stage. Ask at the ticket office, when we were there they were very honest about this and very helpful in determining the best locations.Don't be put off. It's a gorgeous building, well worth seeing. Just be careful where you sit."

He designed and oversaw every detail of the Palau de Musica Catalanya and his vision was inauguratedin 1908. Since then it has undergone extensive renovations and expansion but none of these has taken away from the beauty of the original design. Everything, every decoration and motif is dedicated to the glory of music. Every conceivable style (including some dance) has been welcomed to the stage. From behind the performers along the back of the stage 8 muses, each from a different era and/or country, play their instruments and lean forward to join and inspire the performers. Busts of composers and names of musicians appear throughout the building. And in the center of the ceiling in the auditorium in an incredible light/skylight of the sun in an azure sky.Take the tour or buy a concert ticket and arrive early to take in all of the gorgeous details. Montaner also designed the old hospital which can and should be toured."

Not as touristy as some of the other offerings, so the hall was far from packed--but even from the second balcony it was easy to see details even without opera glasses. It's worth noting that you will NOT have the full effect of the beautiful glasswork if you go after sundown, and they do NOT light the central stained glass feature completely at night--so this may not be a good substitute for the tour if that's your primary interest. One other note: we had a quick drink and snack in the downstairs restaurant (which is pretty common as we understand it). The server was a delight, even though she was rushed off her feet. The cava was quite good, and a generous pour comes in a typical white wine glass--so forget waving your champagne flute around. The \"sandwiches\" were a bit bland and not terribly cheap, so I would be inclined to look for an alternative. Still, overall we had a great experience and I would recommend looking for any concerts of interest as you plan your visit to Barcelona."

Situated in old Barcelona known as La Ribera, this beautiful piece of architecture is a blend of traditional Spanish and Arabic architectures. Completed in 1908, the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana has been a recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997. This building stands out, with it's mosaics, beautifully detailed stained glass, iron and glazed tiles, along with it's eye catching design by Miquel Blay's sculptural group (The Catalan song) on the corner. Guests entered the Palau from the street through 2 arches supported by thick pillars. The concert hall holds about 2000 people. There is a gathering place on the 2nd floor - a second hall. There have been many famous classical music concerts here. When you see this building you can see why - it's a special place for any event. There is also a place to eat - cafeteria style restaurant, Cafe Foyer. I believe there may be another restaurant on the premises. We had a light lunch/snack at the cafeteria. I highly recommend visiting this building, and taking a tour. We were happy we did. It's quite remarkable."

Initially you take a seat in a small auditorium for an introduction followed by a ten-minute film. Then it's upstairs to the foyer, and visitors have only recently been allowed to go outside for a close-up view of the beautiful pillars covered in mosaics. Although you can see these from the street, it's not possible to stand far enough back for a good photo.The main auditorium is sumptuously decorated, and that includes the stage itself where there are muses whose lower half is 2-dimensional but the upper half is 3-dimensional to convey the impression that they are trying to burst out to participate in the performance. The ceiling decoration is also stunning. I had come to Barcelona expecting everything to be about Gaudi, but this building designed by Lluis Domenech i Montaner is equally impressive.During the tour you have the chance to listen to automated organ music by Bach which gives you an idea of the excellent acoustics here. I view this as an attraction not to be missed."

You hear and see perfectly wherever you are seated. I would urge anyone planning a visit to Barcelona, to try to find a performance at the Palau during the time of their visit, so that they could enjoy and appreciate the Palau as it should be enjoyed. There are many websites where one can find the schedule of performances there. A word of advice...they do present, from time to time, Flamenco shows at the Palau, but Flamenco is better seen (and enjoyed) at one of the many small Flamenco venues in Barcelona."

There are shows approximately every six days so you have a good chance of a show being on. We booked at the tourist information place. Do not forget to ask for the jubilados discount if you are over 65. There is a greater variety of seats to choose from if you book at the theatre. The cheapest seats are a long way from the stage and you miss the detail. If you can run to it book the second cheapest or higher in price as it is definitely worth it. Although all seats are raked and in theory all should have an uninterrupted view what happens is that when the dancing starts everyone automatically leans forward and views become obstructed. We actually moved from our almost central seats in the top front circle to the end of the row where we could stand or semi stand without impeding anyone else's view. The show itself runs for ninety minutes without a break and is spectacular. Such passion and the speed is phenomenal. Beautiful costumes too. The singing is very atmospheric but has less impact because of the language barrier. The theatre itself is stunning and even if you do not go to the show at least have a drink in the foyer bar and look at the Art Deco details. There is a good moderately priced restaurant where it is possible to have a classy little 3 course lunch for 14 euros per head. Very close to Catalunya square. Recommended!"

I hope to return one day to listen to a concert here."

What better way to really experience the beauty of the ornate and historical theatre? If you are coming for an evening show, it may be worth it to just come a bit earlier while theres still light to appreciate the building and the fa\u00e7ade. The stain glass ceiling was gorgeous. We sat in a box seat beside the stage and the view was fantastic. The flamenco performance was not bad too, although the experience from watching flamenco in Seville under the stars in an old building courtyard was very much different, watching flamenco in this grand theatre gave a different vibe."

I guess its worth checking the times of the tours etc. Also there are discounts with student card, concessions, hop on/off bus & BCN cards etc.We managed to get discounts as we had the BCN 5 card and also we got two student tickets too. The lady was sitting inside this little window on the left of the building. I kept pointing her out to my sister and my sister thought I was going crazy because she didn't see her inside this tiny little window.The ceiling is really cool with the glass. There was a lot of light coming through the windows which lit up the theatre. I managed to get a really good picture of the ceiling which I am now using as one of my backgrounds for my work computer.You should wear shoes with good grip. My sister slipped on the marble staircase and almost twisted her ankle and shes in her 20s. So use the handrail and take your time with the marble stairs!"

The pictures in the tourist guides that I read made me decide it was a 'must do' tour as an architectural experience and I love theatre/live performances. However I discovered there were seats available for a flamenco evening - dancers, guitars, percussion and singers. What better way to experience this venue? Not cheap but worth it. Get there early enough to experience the building pre event (although you obviously can't go into the auditorium until the performance starts - if you want a tour of the theatre, then go in the day). I wasn't sure what to expect from the show itself as I really didn't know what 'real' flamenco was. Intense, energetic, vibrant...the singing in particular sounded more Arabic than European. If you're a northern European like me, ignorant of this genre, you'll be in for an unteresting surprise."

Similarly the design constraints of being squeezed into a city block with minimal natural light and the glorious solutions that were found. Our tour was by the beautiful, funny and intelligent Aida, whose passion for the place and willingness to address questions was another highlight.Tours take an hour. They go every half hour alternating in English and French. The groups were of 30 or so, so uncrowded.There is a cafe on site, with good coffee. Another wonderful expression of modernism, Mantener not Gaudi, contemporaneous, wonderful to contrast."

The stunning central skylight represents the sun and with its three dimensional drop into the space it seems like a portal to another dimension, akin to music for many. So unique, I cannot even imagine what it must feel like to be a performer with the muses supporting your as they jut our gracefully from the wall behind the stage. It is the only modernist concert hall declared World Heritage by UNESCO (December 4, 1997). I recommend the tour as our guide, Laura, was one of the best that we experienced in Barcelona. Purchase your tickets in advance and then go and see a concert. That is my one regret but a reason to bring me back to this marvellous city."

Seeing a show is a great way to experience amazing performance venues, which is how we came to find ourself listening to Alabama gospel music in Barcelona the week before Christmas. We went to the box office early in our visit to determine what show might fit our schedule, interests and budget. We selected the gospel show because it started at a relatively early 8 pm and it seemed funny to listen to gospel in Spain.Upon arriving at the Palau, we enjoyed a cocktail in the beautiful bar downstairs. It really is an exquisite building, with intricate detail throughout. Then, we proceeded upstairs to take our seats in the elegant and intimate concert hall. It is one of the most beautiful concert halls I've seen, and I'm glad we made time for a visit."

Open for concerts nearly all year long, if you don't have time to take in one of the events, by all means visit for a guided tour by one of the very knowledgeable staff.

After all of the Gaudi hoopla and the full-day tours of his historic structures, who knows about the other major architects of Barcelona's magical fin de siecle whimseys? This jewel-box of a theater is simply the finest concert hall that I have ever enjoyed. In a tour with an enthusiastic guide lasting longer than the promised hour, we were treated to a performance on the grand organ whose pipe case is enshrined in a brilliantly tiled concert shell. The house is a fantastical arrangement of tiled columns, majestic stained glass walls surrounding the seats, coffered ceilings with mosaic and terracotta insets and a huge three-dimensional glass ceiling panel. It is a tour-de-force of engineering and artistry. In any other city in the world this venue would be at the top of any list of tours. In Barcelona, amidst the excellence of the competition for tourists dollars and the lure of pristine beaches, this theater is lower on the horizon of must sees and have-to-dos! Perhaps if I had called this review: The Best-kept Secret in Barcelona! it would get moved up to a higher ranking on the most important sites to visit when in town. This is an exceptional opportunity to see a world-class, perfect jewel box of a theater. MUST SEE!"

The guides were very friendly and knowledgeable however the building speaks for itself: The trencadis pillars and facades are not abstract (like Gaudi) but are covered in floral patterns, each one unique but equally beautiful. The stained glass in the concert hall helps to create an amazing space and atmosphere; there's almost too much to view, certainly in the short time available during the tour - if you haven't got time or the funds to go on the the tour and go to a concert I would recommend going to a concert rather than the tour - that's what the building is for after all!"

We didn't need to book this one online before we travelled as we saw that there were plenty of seats available on different nights and booking at the theatre for a few nights in advance was not a problem. We saw the opera and Flemenco show and it was a really good show. Both the Flemenco signing and dancing as well as the Opera signing was spot on. It was one of the best things that we did while in Barcelona and it was added to by being held in a very decorative building that was worth looking at by itself.Well worth a visit."

Getting closer to take pictures, there were people selling tickets on the street for a flamenco show to start within the next 15 minutes; I am so happy we took the opportunity to attend the show. First, the architecture of the building (outside and inside) is breathtaking.It was definitely a great first contact with flamenco. They told us the show was featuring gypsy flamenco style... although I can't really tell the difference with another style.The show lasts 1 hour 30 minutes (maybe a little long) and we were not allowed to take pictures (I was a tiny bit disappointed). 50 euros per person. Fantastic dancers; you could tell they were having fun and it was contagious!"

You pay 18Eur for a one hour tour, and I saw a 90 minute alternative piano concert (quite unique) for only 22Eur. The flamenco shows happen often as well and are slightly more 30Eur and up. You can arrive 30 minutes before the presentation and look around. Photos are allowed except during the concert. The acoustics are truly amazing. So glad I did it!"

Do not visit Barcelona without visiting this place you will not be disappointed.

We decided on the 40 Euro seats, which were upstairs (Dress Circle). We chose seats on the side, in the 1st or 2nd row but were advised we should sit in the centre, not the side, as we would not be able to see all of the stage in the side seats. This turned out to be really bad advice and disappointing that we would have been so misled. The centre seats upstairs would be great for a concert/choir, but the flamenco dancing is not on the stage. It is on the floor, in front of the stage. Many guests sitting in these seats complained to the ushers that we could not see the dancing and as the upstairs area was not full we were allowed to move to other seats, further back to escape some of the heads in front of us which obliterated the dancers. Extremely disappointing and it was a stretch to see the dancing even then."

Very ornate sculptures around sides and ceiling and rich vibrant colors. There is a large bar/restaurant on first floor and a restaurant on second level. Really memorable setting for a concert (even though all commentary was in Catalan). Well worth seeing."

The Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana is a beautiful and amazing concert hall designed in the Catalan Modernisme style that was declared World Heritage by UNESCO in 1997. People think that Gaudi built it but in reality it was designed by the architect Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner. The architectural decoration in the concert hall is a masterpiece of creativity and imagination and is ornate by many busts of musicians like Sebastian Bach, Beethoven and Richard Wagner. There is a impressive and fantastic stained-glass skylight in the center of the Palau.There are two ways to visit the palace: through a guided tour or buying tickets to a show. The guided tour is wonderful and you can take pictures. The guides have so much knowledge and can well entertain the group of visitors. It lasts one hour and there are tours in several languages like English, French, Spanish and Italian."

By the time we got there the english tour had already started 7 minutes ago. The cashier insisted we could buy tickets for the french tour but we thoght EUR 30 would be a bit steep to pay for a tour we don't understand. We opted to wait an hour for the next english tour and take a strawl in the mazelike, charming little streets in the neighbourhood. The other option would've been to wait outside in the scorching sun, as the palace doesn't have any shelter you could wait in. By the time we got back we were late by 3 (!) minutes. The cashier took his pleasure from telling us he's sorry but we're late for the tour. I told him this must be a joke and he asked how many tickets we wanted (so he probably could've sold us the tickets) but my partner got angry so the cashier refused to sell us the tickets once again. I say there are a million places you can spend your money in Barcelona. Every single one of them will be more intersted in you having a pleasant time than this one."

We watched the Grand Flamenco show on Saturday in July. The theatre is well air conditioned and the sound system, stage, seating was all excellent. My only disappointment was the outside terrace (or you can sit inside in the beautiful cafe area). Because is was a hot evening we thought we would treat ourselves to a glass or two of cava and something light to eat in the terrace. The list is limited but we chose the assorted 'montaditos' -we sent them back - 6 tired little bread snacks - as an alternative we chose the goats cheese salad. This was much better but not outstanding, The 'patas bravas' were edible but odd drenched a mayonnaise seafood sauce. The service is lacking, although our young waiter was charming helping out with our limited Spanish. As it got busier the poor staff are rushed off their feet and we could not order more drinks or get our bill. We were tempted to walk off without it, but in the end we sought out our nice waiter and got our bill. Its a shame, they could make so much more of that terrace area...some cheerful lighting, greenery, better tables and chairs, more staff."

On the tour (required, but photos permitted) we were told of conductors marveling that they could work in natural light, streaming from the stained glass ceiling, the central element of which was called, appropriately, the sun. And that is what it looked like. There are allusions to many things: the ride of the Valkyries, Pegasus, various instruments being performed by the sculpted figures around the stage, heraldic tributes, including ancient Austria-Hungary! The balcony overlooking the street has columns which are unique. Really a magic building to behold. Highly recommended."

I don't think you can enter the theater without being on a tour, unless you watch the concerts at night. The tour was good, they bring you around each section and give you a brief explanation of the history. You are also given enough time to take photos. The theater is so beautiful and well designed to maximise the amount of light coming in, you can see this especially with the centerpiece stained glass ceiling. It is very touristy but definitely worth visiting."

The concert we attended was of four guitarists doing a rather shticky performance, just right for kids, full of humor, but not a \"serious\" introduction to classical guitar. In fact, for reasons I can't understand in such a small hall, every thing was amplified. It would have been much better, if quieter, had they played some or all of it truly acoustic."

Well, I must say, as wonderful a Conductor as Maestro Barenboim is, and he is certainly worth seeing, if you are fortunate enough to have the chance, he doesn't compare to visiting the Palau de la Musica in Barcelona. This whole facility is a piece of art. The stained glass windows were breathtaking, and especially how they were lit up by a setting sun, and all of the Statues around the symphony hall, were so impressive too.The only negative is that it got VERY warm by after the intermission. It got really warm. You have to see this symphony hall on its own merits of absolute beauty. By the way, please explain to Mr. Barenboim, that when the audience in attendance gives a 10 minue standing ovation, it means that they want to hear you, and the Orchestra (and the Choir that was performing as well), to perform again. Instead, the Choir and the Orchestra, got out of their seats, up and down, at least 3 times, Mr. Barenboim walked off the stage, he shook the Conductor of the Choir's hand a couple of times, and then they all went their separate ways. In all of my years attending any type of concert, the performer would stay on for at least one song. It was a disappointing end, to what could have been an awesome evening. Like I said, the all-star performer was the facility! Enjoy the ambience."

One featured a solo Spanish guitarist, who was great. The second was a weird combination of Flamenco and opera. The Flamenco dancing was first class but I would not say traditional as the accompanying instruments included a cello and violin; the opera performances were abysmal. So if you go, go for the architecture, which will not disappoint. The audience is mixed, so be prepared for talking, inappropriate texting/picture taking etc. The ushers are well prepared for this behavior as they will shine flashlights in the faces of offenders."

Go to the bar and drink a coffe or just walk arround. This is a masterpiece of Barcelona arquitecture. Better if you read some documentation about the arqutecture there before you go to understand how amazing this place is. Talikng about the music theater it is a very popular style one. Most of performers are midle class mature people idols or gay icons. I dont like the acoustics of the place, spetially for flamenco and lateral seats are very bad. The ambience is very good and if you are a company owner or an institution chief you can rent the whole place for graduations, celebrations,conferences etc (They do it frequently, no idea about prices). It is an \"at least once\" place to go, just choose the music style you like and spend about 35 eur to have a nice seat."

A very nice 50 minute tour, beginning with a so-so film introduction, but the building itself is quite beautiful, and the music hall ranks with some of the greatest in the world. The stained glass windows and mammoth chandelier are unforgettable. Our English speaking guide (the hourly tours alternate languages, so check the times carefully) was just fine. One highlight was to listen to the grand organ play some Bach for our modest tour group. The outside of the building is impressive, despite being squeezed in among several other structures. There is a great cafe on the ground floor, as well as a nice gift shop. The immediate neighborhood is fun to walk through, and includes both some nice shops and some touristy places."

This was a series of well known Opera Arias sung by a soprano and a baritone, with the added feature of a string quintet and flamenco dancers interpreting the emotion of the music. This venue attracts Europe's top classical music talent and it was at first disappointing that an opportunity to see that sort of performance was not available. However, we were privileged to see this charming eclectic program in an extraordinary building. On the exterior the sculpture portrays Catalonia's popular traditions and the glass facade is a wonderful example of modern construction blended with a heritage building. In the concert hall overhead is an inverted stained-glass cupola and across the back stage wall is a relief, in Art Nouveau style, of musicians in costumes. Even if you don't have time for a concert take a tour of this amazing building. We came back the next day just to see the building in sunlight."

While one can see much of the theatre by attending a concert, the tour was very good and worth taking. We were able to get tickets for the tour and same night performance of Gran Gala Flamenco which was excellent. The theatre was established for choirs for the local people as distinct from the wealthy who went to the Opera House Liceu.

She had planned to give us a demonstration of the pipe organ but there were electronic problems and she could not. I teasingly suggested that she could sing for us instead, and to the surprise of the tour group she agreed and treated us to a lovely operatic aria. She had studied opera in Barcelona and she was wonderful! Her demonstration of the acoustics of the hall was much better than a pipe organ.We returned that night for an amazing concert that combined grand opera and flamenco.

The show mixed opera with Flamenco. Very cool. This has to be one of the best theaters to watch Flamenco or anything else for that matter in the world. The place is drop dead gorgeous. A wonderful design with acoustics to match the aesthetics. I know people go on tours here and I am sure the tour is worth it... watching a flamenco show inside the theater was just that much better for us. The is one of the more underrated experiences in Barcelona."

There were quite a few people on the tour so it may not be possible to buy tickets at the last minute.Our guide Maria was brilliant, she spoke great English and was happy to answer questions. She explained how the Palau came to be built and helped us to understand the significance of the design and decoration. The tour started in the choir rehearsal room with a video presentation about the history and ethos of the Palau.The interior is absolutely gorgeous, you can't really grasp the incredible detail from photos. The stained glass and the ceramic detail are particularly beautiful. If you like modernism/art nouveau in general I'd say this was unmissable. Domenech's style is not the same as Gaudi's, a little more realist and less abstract, but his skill as an architect is not in doubt.There's a nice caf\u00e9/bar area and a shop you can visit for free."

We came in the early afternoon for the tour (a bit pricey, but well worth it) and the early evening for a concert of Beethoven's 9th Symphony. The acoustics way up top where we were seated were a bit muddy, but the time spent in the hall was a wondrous pleasurek. I can't think of any concert hall that has been even 10% as delightful to spend time in. If you're visiting Barcelona, don't miss this spectacular place!"

I sat looking down at the players, and their notes ran together into a mist of sound. Same happened with the tour: The guide's voice faded quickly in the auditorium.

This style of architecture is perfect for a concert hall with it's decorative ceramic roses and stonework. It makes the building look like an old fashioned music box, or a very decorative cake.

A must see for anyone who thought, like me, that mass tourism had done for quality shows like this: 5 stars!!!!"

I saw a review on seeing a Spanish guitars show and think that would be the perfect music for this setting if you like immersing yourself into the culture. The night we were there it was cool outside but very warm inside, not sure if they have A/C but they should have had it on.

We saw a traditional flamenco show later on instead.Despite not knowing any Catalan it was a true experience watching extremely skilled dancers. The stage is quite smaller than most London theatres making it quite an intimate event, and for the better. We got seats in the second tier directly opposite the stage, in the front row which were ideal. They were relatively expensive but well worth it.My only criticism is that it was very hot the whole time, our group genuinely felt sleepy at times as we noticed did many people around us. Would be good if they turned the AC on... though its a minor point.Highly recommend to see a show, its right in the centre of Barca and has quite a few restaurants nearby making it easy to setup a night out."

Magnificent stained glass windows but the skylight is a real gem.Book the tour but expect 30+ people in a group. Tour lasts 45 minutes."

The tour gave an insight into that other great Catalan modernista architect Domenech Montaner. The beautiful details in every part of the building are crowned by the breathtaking ceiling decoration in the main auditorium. The highlight of the tour is when they play a segment of music from the massive pipe organ in this vast room, and you get a sense of how music sounds in this marvelloous space.....or you could just book a concert!"

Almost certainly the most spectacular art nouveau building I have ever seen, as wherever you look is an artistic delight. The figures sculpted and painted on the back of the stage are mesmerising and almost seem alive. This building has to be one of the main attractions in Barcelona, both inside and out and definitely worth a visit, either to see a show (seating comfortable and well spaced out) or just to look at it."

We came here after a long day of sightseeing , exhausted and ready to give in to achy feet and the heat , but the Palau fell on our eyes like a mirage and quenched the thirst of our tired souls. this is one of the most beautiful buildings I have seen anywhere , not just in Barcelona , an eclectic mix of medieval moroccan and modernist and art nouveau glass displays itself invitingly on the outside , but it is the inside that really makes you swoon the auditorium and its glass arches , and art nouveau detailing and sweeping stairs mean that you are likely to miss the concert you came to see , because the building takes all your attention, you can pay for a tour , but choose the right time and day and their are opportunities to see it all for free, the cafe is also good value for a quick snack and drink before you are so refreshed you ready to continue touring the city for the rest of the day"

It's quite popular so you may need to book in advance. You are led into a theatre to watch a short video about the history of the Musica then your guide takes you upstairs to see the balcony section and also the main hall with the magnificent stain glass ceiling light. The guide is obviously well-informed about the music hall and you get to know about all the sculptures on stage and around the back near the seats too. It was definitely worth it and a must-see if you're in Barcelona."

We were lucky to have had an organ performer practicing while we were touring the building, which really enhanced the experience and provided proof to us of the the terrific acoustics. The history of the Palau and its central place in hosting the culturally rich role that choirs play in Barcelona are quite interesting.

While waiting for the guided tour in the foyer, I was mesmerised by the roses on the foyer ceiling and pillars. Without realising it, the quirky foyer adornment had already captivated me. By the time the tour started, I was focused and almost childlike in my growing expectation to be absorbed somehow by aesthetic beauty yet to come deep inside the building. Mounting the stairs, I sensed the excitement of my fellow visitors too, who led the way into a space opening up before our eyes and proving to be so beautiful and so special, so magnificent, that our own importance waned in its presence. The intricate glasswork of the ceiling interacted with our senses, responding to us with a new kaleidoscope of colour no matter where we looked. Such rare beauty made us stay until we had to leave - so very unwillingly. It was only when I felt the warm air on my face again outside, that I realised my soul had been touched by the spirit of pure Catalonia."

There is a tremendous amount of history and pride woven into the space design. It feels like a beautiful church in some ways, but without the overlay or undercurrent of guilt or fear (or inferiority of superiority or history of weary violence) that sometimes permeates religious spaces. I highly recommend it. Allow 2 hrs, no more. An easy thing to weave into a day in the Gothic quarter."

It's possible to admire this splendid piece of architecture by Montaner from the outside (free of charge), but like so many of Barcelona's splendid buildings it is even better to see the interior.We pre-booked tickets that cost approx 14 euros each (with 'discount') - to be honest although it was nice to look inside and admire the splendid interior and learn a little of the history, the 'tour' didn't offer good value for money. It lasted approximately 50 minutes including a 15 minute video relating to its history and previous performers.The building is beautiful internally and should be shown off to visitors but in my opinion the tour doesn't come close to matching the wealth of real information imparted by the free walking tours that operate elsewhere in the city.I would urge those responsible for the building to reduce their tour costs to more accurately reflect the value offered or perhaps incorporate a free coffee and cake within their own nice cafe/restaurant."

The building is beautiful indeed and I do not see what I could add in this matter, after having read a good number of comments already posted here bellow.We didn\u2019t have time to join a guided tour when in Barcelona, so we settled for an evening performance of Georges Bizet\u2019s Carmen. In such outstanding setting, we thought that would be a treat\u2026 but the result turned out to be rather disappointing. How was that ?1) The orchestra was clearly on the small side, definitively not what is normally required for Carmen. However, considering the reduced size of the stage and the fact that they \u201cdid the job\u201d, I\u2019ll give this a miss.2) Far more disturbing were the uneven performances provided by the singers, especially by the leading characters. If Carmen herself was quite good and Escamillo was fine, Don Jos\u00e9 was plainly mediocre \u2013 it was impossible to understand half of what he was singing ; he just didn\u2019t articulate. The worst to come was Mica\u00ebla, Don Jos\u00e9\u2019s fianc\u00e9e ! What a disaster ! I sincerely do not think this lady could be hired for a \u201creal\u201d performance of Carmen, in a \u201creal\u201d opera house. She was simply producing a long set of inarticulate sounds. Not to mention the danca\u00efre \u2013 the \u201csmuggler\u201d \u2013 who was in the same vein. Both of them would have quite rightly been booed by the a \u201cregular\u201d audience\u2026 but there, they were on the contrary enthusiastically applauded ! Which leads to the third problem :3) The audience ! Basically tourists from all over the place, some loaded with LV and Christian Dior bags... Nothing wrong with that in itself of course, but clearly not the usual kind of public for such an event. It is not about being elitist or what\u2026 but simply put, the first time the orchestra was interrupted by burst of applause during the overture because the musicians had just stopped playing, as expected, for 1 or 2 seconds, we somehow smiled with indulgence. However, as this kept repeating itself over and over, we gradually became less amused, and at the end, we found it frankly speaking quite irritating.That was of course only one experience so we would not generalize. However, if we had to attend some similar musical event in Barcelona in the future, we would chose the Liceu rather than the beautiful Palau de la Musica Catalana\u2026"

The Palau de La Musica offers so much programming that it is easy to find a show to attend. Even if you purchase a ticket with limited view you can see the beautiful concert hall and hear the music, Also during the day or before the show, just drop into the lobby or outside courtyard and have a reasonable drink and light meal."

It was built between 1905-08 and is considered one of the most extreme and exuberant buildings even if compared to the cramped and dull surrounding neighbors. We took the guided tour which is expensive but well worth it except for the several hundreds kids who were providing their own acoustics. The fa\u00e7ade features exposed red brick with very colorful ceramic mosaics and glazed tiles. The structure incorporates stained glass, ornate wrought iron, carved stones and colonnades with busts of famous composers.The interior is richly decorated as well with grand marble staircases and crowned lamps. The seating capacity is 2200 with > 500.000 visitors p/year. The auditorium is unique in that it's entirely illuminated by natural light during the day due to the enormous stained -glass skylight ditto sides. Extensive renovation between 1982-89 has added space and modern comfort. In 1997 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site."

As the guide explained, the hall was built with the idea of maximizing the light through the stain glass windows, and concerts were often planned for afternoons to take advantage of the light. We visited the Palau immediately after seeing Sant Pau Recinte Modernista, built by the same architect: Lluis Domenech i Montaner. Similarities abound. For ticket discounts, we used a senior rate for one, and the Bus Turistic coupon for the second, 25euro total."

Once the program was finished, the audience chanted until they played three more traditional songs, to which everyone sang along, including one at the end that sounded like Auld Lang Syne, where everyone stood up and held hands!

Been there two years ago for the guided tour during the day and to eat an apple in the sun at their outdoors cafe.This year (in February, 2015) I was once again in Barcelona and was longing to revisit the Palace of Music. There was a guitar festival going on in Barcelona and I stopped to see how much it would cost to get it. My luck was that I got a chance to see Estrella Morente. I bought 2 20eur tickets and went to the concert. Even though we had no visibility seats (meaning we couldn't see the 2 performers in the middle of the stage downstairs, as we were seated at the 2nd floor) we could see the entire Palace and hear perfectly. Luckily there were no seats behind us so we could stand up and also see the performers. Being given that I bought 2 of the last 10 or so tickets, as it was almost sold out on the day of the concert, I am grateful I could be there to enjoy the uplifting singing of Estrella Morente.If you get a chance to buy tickets in advance do go. Just go anyway. You'll get a wonderful experience.A truly must visit arhitectural and artistic masterpiece monument!!!"

The tile mosaics are characteristic of the Montaner/Gaudi buildings, but this building is genuinely a spectacle to behold - literally every visible surface is exquisite. Need I say more?We didn't do the formal tour, instead we booked tickets to two different performances during the Christmas-New Year time - \"Four Guitars\" and \"Noche Flamenca\" - both were outstanding performances and highly recommended. If you're bored with the performance, it doesn't matter...you can just gaze up at your incredible surroundings!!We had fantastic seats for both of our performances - in the first we were up on the second level balcony, near the front where the railing starts to curve around, which afforded fantastic views of the performers. In the second performance we were in one of the boxes near the stage - the best ones are the 2nd - 4th boxes from the stage as you are on the same level as the stage and are near enough to see the sweat beading on the forehead of the dancers!"

Our second visit, I looked online to find concert schedule as I wanted to see the inside, too. I noticed a 5 euro per ticket children's concert during our stay and planned that day around the event. The concert was midday, so the stained glass window roof and beautifully tiled pillars were lit up as well as the faces of the children's parents enjoying their children singing. What a lovely way to experience this music palace - in use by locals!The music palace has a small assortment of nice (slightly pricey) snacks downstairs in its beautiful cafe - nice for your wait after picking up your pre-purchase tickets.Ticket line is somewhat slow. We came in the morning at 9:30 (opening of ticket windows), picked up our tickets and then went on a one-hour tour of the Picasso Museum (5 minute walk away if you know the way - give it 20 if you are not familiar so you will not be late) and returned for the concert.Late lunch at Ils 4 Gats restaurant (Picasso's famous hangout) was next, then strolling the Gothic Quarter and over to Las Ramblas for dinner.(If you are new to Barcelona and plan to walk, using Google maps as guide (like we did), give yourself extra time for a few variables:* getting lost in the grid of narrow streets and tall buildings (some waiting for satellite to fly overhead and update your current location* finding fascinating distractions you may never pass again but want to browse at for a few minutes* accidentally walking past your destination because of innocuous indistinction from surrounding buildings* finding the inner courtyards of many landmarks (hidden by the walls that look like all the others - more or less).Barcelona is great!

The interior of the building is very beautiful and if you have a knowledgable guide you will be shown nuances of design, decorations in the modernisme style.It is cheapest to buy a family pack if your party has several adults and children. They also have discounts for seniors and children if you cannot take advantage of the family pack. Additionally their coupons are included in the book of coupons given by the hop-on-hop-off but tour operators.This was a very informative tour of a beautiful building right in the middle of El Born neighborhood of Barcelona. Make sure to go and check out the original fa\u00e7ade and entrance to the building on the side street.

It was built in 1908 and is a wonderfully harmonious whole, with every detail so well thought out and so fitting the concept. If you like Art Nouveau you will not find another building on such a scale to match this one. The details reward you for careful study. The colours are restful and yet striking at the same time. The most amazing single feature is the central glass ceiling, which is in fact a skylight so in the daytime the room is flooded with natural light coloured by the stained glass of the ceiling. The guided tours appear to be the only way you can see the building and take photographs, since of course photograpy is not allowed in concerts. Do not miss this building when you visit Barcelona!"

There's a variety of types of music on at the Palau, but it's ususlly classical. I would definitely go to a concert here just for the atmosphere; the music is a bonus. Soemtimes they have very good musicians, and on others they have second-rate orchestras doing popular classical hits. But whoever's playing, go. It's just spectacular inside.Highly recommended for a very pleasant Barcelona evening. Very popular with the local middle classes. A true Barcelona experience. You don't have to wear a suit and tie, but do wear at least long trousers and a decent shirt. Pruces for tickets are quite good, especially for matinee shows."

It was a nice tour, and the main music hall is stunning, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here if I were a tourist. The one-hour tour highlights the building and the main concert hall, but it drags on at times, and once you've seen it for 15 minutes you're almost ready to leave. I'd give it a go if I had nothing else to do. A plus is its near Placa de Catalunya and the Rambla. Terra Blava is a great place to have lunch right around the corner."

Most guided tours are engaging and in my experience quite informative and interesting.When in the main room, the organ was played, again it didn't seem that impressive.It would have been nice to have the tours timed with various rehearsals so the people paying for tours can get a feel for the music and shows hosted.

The building, inside and out, is a riot of colour in glass and ceramic. The main concert hall has a small stage with 18 muses around it, each painted and sculpted and playing a different instrument. The muses are there to support and inspire the actors - at least a couple cannot be seen by the audience! The highlight has to be the skylight in stained glass and central convex artificial sun.The tour is fairly pricy at \u20ac18 but I certainly felt it was worth it.

I have been to a number of beautiful covert halls: L'Opera in Paris, the Magyar Opera Hall in Budapest, the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. and Lincoln Center in New York City, to name just a few. But, this is the most unique and in some ways the most extraordinary of them all.  Unfortunately, I did not get to see a performance there so I can't comment on the acoustics. The only other way to see the building is to sign up for a guided tour. I did it online. There are a number of tours conducted in different languages almost every day. The building is very convenient to the Metro system, but I walked there from my apartment on Via Laeitana. I spent a good 30 minutes prior to the tour just walking around and photographing the exterior, which is beautiful. But it is topped by the interior, an incredible modernista structure which was designed by 3 modernista architects other than Gaudi. (If you are not yet familiar with modernista architecture, don't confuse it with modern architecture; it is a movement which started in the late 19th Century.) The entryway area, where you check in and get your ticket, is more modern and nothing special. But once you get inside the original structure, be sure you have your camera ready and be prepared for your jaw to drop. It certainly is not as ornate as the interior of L'Opera, for example, but is just as beautiful in my opinion -- and certainly more unique.  It really is an attraction which no one visiting Barcelona should miss. And, since it is located just a short stroll from Placa de Catalunya, it can be combined with a stroll through the Barri Gotic or El Born or up the Passeig de Gracia or a visit to City Park or whatever else you want to do in this extraordinary city where I have spent 14 weeks over the past two years and still not seen all of its wonders."

My disappointment was that we had the second most expensive tickets, and they weren't cheap by any means. The seats were upstairs in the first balcony off to the side and in the second row. Even one row back made it impossible to see a good part of the performance and was frustrating. I would recommend going a day or two early to the box office and trying to choose your seats, either first balcony center and front row, or downstairs center or side closer to the stage. The downstairs side seats look decent, but again probably best to not be in back of someone else. I would go again, but would not want the person in the box office choosing seats for me. It was a waste of us $50 per ticket to be in the middle of a great performance and not be able to see much of it."

Our hotel tried to book us into a smaller venue, but having read those reviews here on TripAdvisor, we decided to see the show at the Palace of Catalan Music.Again, the building in and of itself is an amazing structure. There are representatives on La Rambla offering 10% discounts for show tickets (as do hotels, bus tour maps, etc), so you should be able to save a little. If you have time, buy the tickets a day or so before as the good seats tend to sell out quickly. Seats start at 35 euro and go up from there. We ended up with 40 euro seats (minus 10%). The venue was not completely full, so we were able to move a few seats within the same row to get a better view.The show itself combines opera and flamenco and is a good mixture of both. The singers and dancers are amazing and quite entertaining. The theater is very strict about using any phones or cameras or electronic devices, so there are no distractions from the show itself."

Moths before traveling to Barcelona, I checked the Palau's website to see if anything was on while we were there, and I was disappointed to find nothing scheduled. One night when we were there, we happened to walk by, and a guitar concert was about to start. We were so fortunate to get tickets. The quality of the performance, the gorgeous and unique architecture with great acoustics, and the setting in the Gothic Quarter made this our top experience in Barcelona!"

Built in a dark and narrow street in Barri G\u00f3tic, the old town, it is full of light and colour. To really appreciate this achievement, you may want to compare it with Palau G\u00fcell, another gem in itself and also in Barri G\u00f3tic - it is beautiful and colorful, but not at all full of light. The space is so narrow there is no good outside photo of the building. You will find excellent guided tours, interesting history and really beautiful interior. Particularly surprising is the acoustics which is good despite the huge glass surfaces created to allow as much light as possible. Colored and double - or maybe triple - pane, they seem to provide good insulation without unwelcome vibration. No need to call attention to the central ligth structure - impossible to miss."

This was the first time we had heard of it and we were really happy that we took her advice and went to see it! You cannot visit it on your own - to go in you have to go with a guided tour. You queue up outside the building and talk to someone you can barely see through an oval hole in the wall, We had a good senior discount. We paid \u20ac11 each instead of \u20ac18. We had a little while to wait for our tour so went into the snack bar. We had a glass of Fino Sherry and a delicious pintxo each. A pintxo is the Basque equivalent of a tapas. This was \u20ac14 for the 2 of us. The guided tour was very good - the guide spoke excellent English and he was not boring to listen to. First we had a video which told about the origins of the building and its architect and architecture. Then into the building proper, It is wonderful and highly decorated in the art nouveau style. We were able to walk on the terrace which overlooks the road. It has splendidly decorated pillars and roof. Then into the concert hall proper. Another flamboyantly decorated space. It is designed to be lit by natural light and has a wonderful and very distinctive \"skylight\" for want of a better word. The guide explained that it wasn't a theatre as such and it was designed for choirs to sing on the stage - there are no curtains. There is a massive organ which is maintained by the Germans. The concert hall and its sculptures are full of symbolism. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit."

Fortunately, we were able to do this easily! One afternoon after exploring the city, we walked up to the box office and were able to get good seats for that evening's performance, a flamenco show. Tickets were about 40 euros. A spectacular venue! The stained glass work on the ceiling, the main attraction, is worth the ticket price! Simply breathtaking! And the show was fantastic--very high energy. There are many types of performances each night. Often Spanish guitar is featured, but we had already seen that in a wonderfully intimate setting at Basilica Santa Maria del Pi. So we opted for the flamenco show and were not disappointed. There are tours of the Palace you can take during daytime hours, but if you decide to go see a show, you can easily skip the tour, as you'll see the inside while sitting in your seat!A nice Spanish experience and a great way to end a day."

The details are best seen in daylight, so I can't speak to seeing a musical concert. My only negative comment is that the price is steep at 18euros. If you want to see an example of Montener's work for less money, I highly recommend the Hospital of Sant Creu and Sant Pau at 8 euros. It's a group of buildings and grounds where you can appreciate the external architecture of the buildings and see some amazing mosaics and tile work in the administration building at the end of your tour."

It is one of the few places in Catalunya where one can go to a top Flamenco concert or guitar recital. It is not all highbrow - check the web site. According to my musician friends (one has performed there) the acoustics are not the best but it is great to play in because of the highly knowledgeable audience.The catering has improved greatly and they even do a good value for money business lunch at around \u20ac14! The bar does great pre-performance snacks with the ubiquitous cava.The tour of the building is just not worth the entrance price when compared with the cost of going to a concert. It is possible to just go to the bar for free to get a taste of the crazy building.I look forward to my next visit."

I don't believe you can tour it outside of a tour group or booking a ticket to a concert. We were thrilled that we got tickets for \"Barcelona 4 Guitars\", which was a perfect combination of Spanish and Classical guitar music, performed at a concert music level, along with entertaining moments, a healthy dash of humor, a little audience participation, and a splash of surprising drama at the conclusion. Be sure to arrive early so that you have a chance to soak in and appreciate the architecture and artistry of the concert hall itself, have a drink at the bar which is studded with spectacularly beautiful stained glass and mosaic tiles, and take some pictures before the concert starts. The building photographs beautifully! I know that you can purchase tickets online, but we just swung by the on-site ticket office as we were out strolling, so we had a live person to assist us in picking out the production we wanted to see and our seats for the concert. I read in another review that someone happened upon a couple of free concert nights online, so that's worth checking out, too.It is well worth the time and money to experience the Palace of Catalan Music, no matter how you choose to do it. It is known as Barcelona's most-loved music venue for good reason, and it's one of our fondest memories of our 5 day stay in Barcelona."

Maybe because of the time of year, we saw no lines for the tour. The building is such a tribute to the people of Barcelona who obviously value the arts - our guide explained how people from all walks of life have helped support it. Our guide gave us the basics but he could have done so much more with a little creativity in an auditorium with terrific acoustics. I wish we had gone to a performance instead of taking the tour, but none of the ones offered were what we were hoping to attend on our two days in Barcelona. If we had to do it again, we would go to a performance even if the music wasn't one of our favorites."

The lights, outdoor bar/cafe and the groups of people milling around caught our attention. The place was buzzing and so we visited the website as soon as we could and discovered two free classical concerts the following evening. We went down in person to pick up the tickets as soon as it opened at 10 am and went to the 30 minute concert that evening. It was a fantastic classical ensemble: piano, violin, viola, clarinet and flute and we were treated to half an hour of musical delight. We could have stayed for the second concert but it was late and we had children with us. It was in the smaller concert hall, but still, it was a wonderful experience and memorable event in Barcelona. We considered the tour of the main hall which looked magnificent in pictures, but the cost of nearly \u20ac80 for a family of four was too pricey. Well worth a visit though and look out for free tickets!"

It is both an architectural masterpiece, designed by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, who was Guadi's teacher. It is also an acoustical heaven.Take the tour - it's a little steep, but well worth it.This is one of the world's premier music halls - and the testaments from musicians, singers and conductors on the short film at the beginning of the tour pay homage to the hall and the musical sounds that are created within.Inside and outside, the architecture is amazing, so to is the light - on both the stage and the orchestral seats. Our tour guide was really fascinating - sharing his joy of music, the hall, Catalonia and Barcelona with us. The only way to see this magnificent palace (unless one is able to obtain tickets for a performance) is on a tour - held every half-hour. Inside the hall performances of all kinds take place - classical, opera, pop, folk, jazz - everything to make this the center of music in Barcelona.We asked our guide how the hall faired during the Civil War and after, when Franco took out his vengeance on the people of Catalonia and Barcelona. Our guide described the location of the hall, centered in the El Born neighborhood, in a sense hidden by the surrounding streets, making it a difficult target for the Italian and German aircraft of their day. The hall was also the site of one of the last demonstrations against Franco. After the Civil War, Franco not only punished Catalonia for their support of the Loyalist government, but also boycotted the city. In 1960, Franco attended a concert at the Palau - in preparation for the concert, more than 400 police spy's were in the seats (out of a total of 2100 total seats). During the concert, from throughout the audience, those attending rose singing a banned Catalonian folk anthem. Franco's secret police shot into the crowd, killing more than 100.As we were leaving we looked at the prices for upcoming performances - the winter holiday shows were priced between 15 - 50 euros - a real bargain considering prices at Lincoln Center in New York."

It is indeed a really beautiful building, in a Modernista style, and one of the most beautiful buildings of catalan modernism, but compared to other buildings in Barcelona, it is not the most \"must see\"-able place. I went on the guided tour with an english guide, and compared to most of the audio-guided tours (like the one of casa Mila and La Sagrada) it was a bit mediocre and maybe overpriced (by comparison). I am not a snob, but if you don't go there to see (or better said, hear)a concert, you cannot fully appreciate the Palau for it's actual purpose. The guide didn't say much more than the \" top 10 barcelona book\" or more than the guide from the fat tire bike tour, so I wasn't impresed and was expecting more (more spoken details about the architecture, Montaner's life, accoutics etc.) and most of the tour we were left wondering around and admiring the details on tyhe walls. It is quite impressive from the outside as it is on the inside and if you think about the fact that it was built in 3 years in a confined space, it'really remarcable."

There was so much to look at and it really suits a crazy, happening, joyful city like Barcelona.Rather than taking a guided tour, which is an option, I preferred to attend a performance, because I feel that it gives a visitor a better feel of a venue. I opted for a show which was a mix of flamenco and opera and bought an expensive seat in the platea section at the last minute. Box office, security and ushering staff were all pleasant and helpful.The show was just average. There were some great voices, both operatic and flamenco, but a couple of the singers were clearly having problems with the technical side of things and were frantically signalling to the sound engineers. It took over half an hour to achieve a proper balance and detracted from their performance. While very earnest and keen, I thought that the flamenco dancers were just average, especially since I have seen quite a lot of this art form. In any case, flamenco is not native to Barcelona and is really only offered here to satisfy tourist demands.However, I wasn't really disappointed. I wasn't expecting a truly great show, but it was a memorable experience to sit in a good seat in a venue like this and have entertainment as well. I still smile whenever I think about it. To be fair, I should add that the people sitting around me seemed to really enjoy the show enormously, so I may be the odd person out here."

You will get to see the main concert hall -- but you won't see the artists' breakroom and get to go on the balcony or see the pipes. It's interesting -- but a full concert experience would have been so much more meaningful. The group was a bit large (around 30 people) and not quite as well orchestrated -- as we missed the last part of the tour due to lack of direction....not well orcheshrated...pardon the pun!"

Its amazing.You must not miss a visit to the Palau."

The Palau de la Musica is a stunning building, everywhere you look there is something else fascinating to look at - it is truly an amazing theater. The building is a piece of art . People were taking pictures but it would not do the building justice. We did not have time but tours are available ( in English) that will get you back stage and give you the history of the building - also a discount if you buy a ticket for a performance. We went to see Opera y Flamenco it was amazing. The opera singers are very good, the dancers were amazing. The woman dancer in particular was very good she flowed on the stage and when she danced with a long scarf it was amazing how she could make it move."

This certainly provided us with an excellent focal point to the stage. We enjoyed the Flamenco performance and were captured by their talents.The acoustics in the hall were excellent and we were pleased to have seen a performance here while we were in Barcelona. We did notice others in the audience bending & standing to see certain portions of the stage. They were seated in the back rows on the sides of the upper balconies. If the performance is not 'active' this may not matter."

Fantastic; it was one of our best and favorite tours in Spain.Seeing the Palace as it was meant to be, with light streaming in through the million cuts of stained glass was fabulous: the color reverberates onto the over-the-top ceramic frosting. The tour starts with a film on the history, building, and interviews with several distinguished musicians about the acoustics and appreciative fans. The tour takes you to the top, nose-bleed seats, so you get an overall appreciation of the 2,000-seat place; it takes you to the outside ceramic pillars for a photo-op; it ends in the orchestra seats near the meaningful statuary with a short organ recital. Although the place is mostly iron-and-glass, the seats have a bit of sound absorption (you learn during the tour). The acoustics were as good for the solo guitar that evening as for the throbbing organ. But the venue was much more dramatic during the day.Best of all, since the Palau is run by a foundation, money for the tours supports the resident orchestra."

Designed in Catalan modernista style, almost every surface is decorated either with mosaics or with stained glass. The central internal ceiling consists of a giant three-dimensional inverted dome in stained glass, representing the sun with its rays extending outwardly towards faces of women also in stained glass. Around the rear of the stage, there are eighteen different muses and each one is playing a different musical instrument. Unusually, their upper torsos are in three-dimensional sculptural form, but their lower bodies are represented in two-dimensional mosaics and each one is wearing a different skirt. It appears that one muse wearing a flamenco-style skirt appears to be looking backwards over her shoulder is playing the castanets. There are so many aspects to admire in this beautiful building either during the day or at night. The accoustics are incredible!"

Some of the dance was obviously talented but it was interjected with two Spanish women screeched and at times screaming over the top of the instruments.

The lady guide made the visit very relaxed and interesting, and the organ played so we could appreciate the acoustics. Our only disappointment was that there was a flamenco show on in the evening, but we had not taken anything suitable to wear to such a show, so didn't feel we could go, so I would advise that anyone thinking they might like to see a show here, pack something other than shorts!"

You start off with a video in the practice hall detailing the history of the Palau, then move through the building. The auditorium is amazing with so much to see with any different materials. If I had time I would have booked a concert as well, to listen to great music whilst looking at the amazing surrounding would be wonderful. Every part of the Palau has beautiful ceramics, glass and mosiacs on the walls and ceilings. Eating in the cafe is a bit like being in the dining area of the V&A in London. The building is hidden away and hard to find as it is set back from the main road."

The building is quite simply stunning with beautiful stained glass, carving and details. The show didn't start until 9.30pm which was quite late after a full day of site seeing but it held our interest throughout with excellent dancers and musicians. We had front row seats in the circle which gave us an excellent view. Only criticism was that the seats were uncomfortable but it's an old building so that's to be expected."

One starts the tour seeing a short movie about the Palau. Many of the performers who appeared on film said that when they performed there, they were quite distracted because there was so much beauty there.When we went they allowed photography, which is great. Apparently they had changed their photography policy about 2 years ago and now allow photography. This is the place to take photographs!The most amazing thing is that the architect Lluis Domenech i Montaner was able to finish the building in only 3 years."

I chose front, middle of the 1st floor central stalls ..brilliant views of the hall and of the performers, great sound. Saw a performance of 4 top guitar players, expected it to be a bit touristy but their ability was top quality. Highly recommended as a memorable Barcelona experience. It was busy but not booked out on the day so you could take pot luck, but I was glad I forward booked for prime seats. Arrive early for a drink and to soak in the atmosphere.

We intended to take the guided tour of the concert hall but noted there was a Flamenco concert on that evening so booked to see that and take the opportunity to look around the venue before the concert - combining both activities in one visit. The hall itself is magnificent - I've not seen anything like it before. Art Nouveau at its Spanish best. I was particularly impressed to see how they have also combined the new architecture with the old when extending the building. In terms of the concert - fantastic music and dance, powerful signing and a totally emotional performance. Unfortunately the event was marred by the poor view provided in the tiered seats. I imagine for a pure musical concert the seating arrangement will work, but for a stage performance the shallow raking of the seats means you are constantly trying to peer between the heads of the people in front. My advice - go for the best seats in the house and most certainly try to get front row seats in any of the upper seating areas."

The Palau is best accessed through taxi or public transit because it is in the very crowded Las Ramblas and Liceu area of Barcelona.

The price was 32 euros and 2 seats were still available in the 5th row of the orchestra pit, directly in front of the stage, so we bought them. The concert was wonderful, though a bit brief compared to long symphonic performances in the USA. We did hope to photograph the interior during the intermission but there was no intermission, and we were hurried out by staff that was eager to close up after the concert, roughly around 11pm. If you want to see the fine stained glass and art noveau interiors, plan to arrive EARLY for a performance, or, get the 17 euro ( a bit pricey by some opinions) guided tour during the day."

The tour of the building I took was very nice with lots of information about the building that I promptly forgot. One of the bad parts of the tour was that the building was silent and isn't the purpose of a grand theater to hear music?Following my tour I checked out the box office concert tickets and found a concert that was priced cheaper than the guided tour. Yes, it wasn't a first rate artist, but it was still a very good musician playing guitar which was very enjoyable to listen to while gazing all around at the beautiful details of the building. My seat for that concert was in the balcony with good sight lines to the stage and the glorious stained glass done of the auditorium seemed close enough to reach out and touch. Yes, a concert won't give you the details about the architect or the construction of the building, but those you can find in any good guidebook. A concert will give you the chance and the time to explore the building without a sense of being rushed through so go early, enjoy a glass of wine in the lobby or maybe a snack at the lobby bar and take the time to explore.Now when I plan trips to Barcelona I always make a point of checking out the concert schedule and make plans for an evening at the Palau."

The group was fairly small so it was easy to hear the guide and move about within the rooms. The tour was given in English and although brief (less than an hour) it gave a solid overview to the place. There was a short video at the beginning describing the building's inception, design, and notable performances. Once inside the theater, we had a chance to sit in the ground floor seats as well as the balcony and I have to say that I much preferred the view from the \"nosebleed\" section, since you are closer to the ceiling and have a full view of the entire space. (Of course if you were there to see a show, maybe you would want to be closer to the stage). The only reason for a four-star review instead of five is that at 18 euros per person, the admission fee was pretty expensive for such a short tour. (If you plan to do the Bus Turistica, do it before coming here as you can get 20% off per ticket. I wish we had done that, actually...). For only a little more than the tour fee you can actually book a show there, which we may try to do while we're in town. It is truly a gorgeous building, definitely a must-see among all the sites in Barcelona."

Hard to add new insights, but this really is a must see (ironically every Gaudi building we passed has queues round the block, where this is much quieter). The tour is not cheap but can be easily booked up online. The english speaking guide that we had was excellent, and took the time to describe the importance of the building to Catalonia - in an even handed and informative manner - and highlighting the differences in say, the mosaic technique there versus Gaudi's Parc Guell. Interesting anecdotes too - such as the movement to get it pulled down in the Modernist '60's and '70's. How times and tastes change. Domenech i Montaner must have been a complete genius to pull it off in a couple of years, including the interior decorations. The interior - stained glass, mosaics - is a riot of colour. The \"new\" glass side is well executed too, as well as the new tower. Wife and I made a mental note - try and come back and go to a matinee to listen to music in that beautiful hall."

Barcelona is so much about Gaudi, but here is an opportunity to see a building by his contemporary and at the time probably more respected architect Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner. The music palace is simply gorgeous. You must reserve a tour in advance and they are offered throughout the day in several different languages. We were there in August and were able to get same day tickets though we reserved them first thing in the morning for an afternoon tour. You can reserve online. The tour includes a brief 10 minute film which was an interesting introduction and history of the Palace. Then it is off to see the auditorium and its beautiful windows, organ, art. The tour guide was very informative and our entire group (ages ranged from 7-74) thought that it was one of the better tours of our 7 night trip to Barcelona. It lasted approximately 50 minutes. There is a nice, but small gift shop and a little place to buy food. The food was actually a great deal with a large hamburger, fries and drink for 10 euros."

If you've exhausted all the Gaudi's sites, or would like to visit places built by someone else, Palau de la Musica Catalana is for you. It is a concert hall built around 1905, still in use today. Don't expect the style to be too different from what's you've seen though, as Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner was Gaudi's main rival, also part of the Catalan Modernist / Art Nouveau \"movement\". The tour is informative and interesting, but a bit overpriced as there is not much to see besides the hall itself and the intermission room. Best might be to book for a matinee concert (for the light coming through the stained glass windows) and enjoy the views then. "

While not designed by Gaudi, it nonetheless exudes the groundbreaking turn-of-the-century exuberance that characterizes the city. Throughout the day, one sees tour groups stopping to photograph the ornate facade, and the theater itself is equally lavish inside, with an airy, sylvan feel and glorious light. It's a nice place to listen to music, too: The old-fashioned brass and velvet seats are well-spaced, and the acoustics seemed very good (although the performers used a sound system). Overall, for a night of art and culture, the Palau de la Musica Catalana is highly recommended!"

I was not crazy about the combination of opera and flamenco, and the sound was way too loud because of all the electronic enhancement that seems to be part of even a subway musician's technical equipment these days. The tickets are pricey, so we tried to get one of the less expensive ones, which means we had to sit somewhere from where it was hard to see the whole stage. Good thing that the hall was not full, and we could move to better seats with the usher's approval.The architecture, however, was breath taking. The painted glass windows change colors with the change of lighting from inside or the natural light from outside, and it was just fabulous. The tiles and other ceramic decorations in the hallways, the brickwork and the arches were just unbelievably beautiful and unique.Before the concert, there is food in a cafeteria, a selection of tapas-style mini sandwiches, good coffee, and drinks. The bathrooms are very small, but clean, with long lines of waiting both before and after the concert. On Fridays, the Metro works till 2 am, so we did not have to add taxi bills to the high price of our ticket, but overall, I agree with others on this site that it gives you a better feel for the Palau if you pay for a concert instead of just doing the tour. I wish they had more discounts for educators, or for those who have visited other sites in Barcelona."

We were in the balcony and that seems to be the best location from which to appreciate the grand and glorious architecture and ornamentation.

We enjoyed a light dinner at the Palace before the show and it was not too pricey. Definitely a must see in Barcelona."

You still have to see it but make sure you pick a date except Monday to see it. Unfortunately for us, the guide in english was a bit too rude. There was a couple with a little baby. Instead of politely pulling them to the side to talk because the baby was crying. He said in front of a big crowd that the should leave if the baby continued to cry.I would say this is very rude for a paying customer. I was shocked.Anyway, back to the place. It was good. Go but rather expensive."

I would not recommend flamenco performances. They are being repeated as a main tourist attraction, therefore do not meet the visitors' expectations. 35\u20ac ticket is a waste of money as you cannot see, even though you have paid more especially for that reason (lower cost tickets do not offer view). During the performance you can even change your seat, without any control from the personnel, which means that many persons that had paid much less than us, just moved in the front seats, having a better view and obstructing us at the same time."

I had never even heard of the Palau de la Musica Catlana before arriving in Barcelona and I question which rock I had been hiding under to have ever missed it. It is a phenomenal space, and that is just for the guided tour - I didn't even see a concert.As for all the large attractions here, buy your tickets online to make sure you arrange a tour in the right language. And please be sure to buy a ticket - the tour is 55 minutes long but flies by with an introductory video then a walk around the outside rooms of the hall before finishing in the concert hall itself, with an organ demonstration to feel the power of the acoustics as you gaze upon the splendour of the glass and ironwork inside.The guide we had was very knowledgeable and engaging and enthusiastically described the details of the space, its history, its present and its near-future. I was very impressed and will certainly book a ticket for a performance here the next time I visit Barcelona."

At the same time, this guide tour was a good English exercise for japanese. At the end of the tour, we had the time for a question and answer. Many people asked the questions. Next time, I also would like to do some questions.This building is decorated with the staind glass and the mosaic. Especially, looking at the beautiful , colorful columns with floral pattern, it seemed to me that the Spanish brightness, gaiety, and tenderness were expressed in those columns. After the sightseeing, we had a lunch at cafeteria on the first floor. Ordering the cappuccino, The garcon draw a musical note on the bubbled cream of cappuccino. I was deeply moved !

It was also nice that we were allowed to take photos :) I totally recommend this place! It was a pity we never got a chance to watch a concert there.

(Easily pick up the tickets at the theatre right before the show.) I picked 3rd row seats to be close which was fun. Seats a bit further back would have given you a better view of the entire theatre. Flamenco is not offered every night. I was so glad we didn\u2019t do the dinner/show combo places after reading the reviews of poor food and small stages. Make a reservation for Arcano, 2 blocks away, order their fixed price meal (with wine) and it will be less than the combo places. The great food and energetic show were our family\u2019s favorite night out of the whole vacation. P.S. we didn't book the tour--didn't see the point"

Tours are just 10 Euro without going to a performance. I highly recommend seeing a live show if you can, then you see it and experience for what it was designed for - both acoustically and visually.

His commentaries were interesting and clear and he spoke good english. It was the person accompanying him on the tour who made this even more of a Rip off than it already was. I don't know about you but for 18\u20ac I want to to have time to take in every detail of this magnificent place and take pictures, sit and wonder. However you are ushered out of every room in such a rush and if you try to take a few extra seconds for that one special photo you are told off by what I assume is \"security\" because they have a time schedule to respect. There is no way this visit is worth the money and I am disgusted at the way we were treated when we tried to explain that we weren't happy and we weren't the only people on our tour who weren't impressed. Buy postcards if you want to see what it looks like from inside it will save you time, money and a lot of frustration."

The Palau de la Musica Catalana is one of the well-known, stunning buildings that should not be left out of the list attractions of anyone coming to Barcelona. The building is worth seeing even only from the outside - if you're in a hurry -, as there are beautiful statues embellishing the outer walls, and you can enjoy a cup of coffee inside the old foyer, allowing you to admire some of the unique architecture while doing so.Tours are organized daily, in several languages, as there is no option for a self-guided visit otherwise. As others have mentioned, a good idea would be to opt for an actual concert, instead of the guided tour, as they tend to cost about the same (15 Euros). HOWEVER, you should keep in mind that the tour is held inside the *Concert Hall* in the old palace (with complex architecture, stained glass, statues, etc.), while most of the concerts are held in the *Petit Palau* instead (the new addition to the building, displaying a minimalist style that is not worth visiting in itself, as it totally lacks the glamour of the concert hall). I have added a picture of both the Concert Hall and the Petit Palau to this review, so that you can see the difference for yourself.As there were no concerts for us in the old palace, we did them all!We went on a guided English tour that took us to all levels of the old building, allowing us to take as many pictures as we wanted to. We also got to watch a short documentary about the history of the place and its architect. Our guide informed us that we could pick up some brochures on our way out that would allow us to go to the Mozart concert that night with a 50% discount, which meant we got to listen to the talented Kristian Bezuidenhout play the piano for only 7.50 Euro (instead of the usual 15 Euro rate), which was a steal!So, if you take the tour, make sure to ask about any available discounts, as you might be in for a treat.We had actually intended to go to the Sibelius orchestra concert, which was playing later in the week, so we went to it as well, and it was spectacular! I genuinely held my breath during parts of Pelleas et Melisande, due to the wonderful interpretation.Having visited the Old Palace (i.e. the Concert Hall) once, and attended two concerts in the Petit Palau, I still wish I could have attended even more events in this wonderful place.Word of caution for travelers - make sure you get off at the Urquinaona metro station located right across the street from the Palau. All other exits bearing the same name involve quite a bit of a walk otherwise."

This is a unique building that has been pleasing theater goers and tourists for decades and is still going strong.We opted to enjoy the opera and flamenco show rather than take the tour. The singers and dancers were first rate and real crowd pleasers. The surprise ending drove the croed wild.The building is awesome - it is hard to look in any direction inside or out and not be impressed.The cofee shop offers reasonably priced sandwiches, cakes and cofees fo you won't go hungry."

After being up for 24 hours (flight) it seemed a foolish idea to book tickets for a 9:30 performance but the program that we wanted to see (Gran Gala Flamenc) was only playing on that evening...so off we headed and hoped that we wouldn't fall asleep. First, let me say that we had been told to arrive an hour prior to the show so that we could tour the theater to take photos and we were very happy that we did as the venue itself is breathtaking. The show was so outstanding that there was no way in the world that we could have fallen asleep. This is a definite 'don't miss' experience and I would tell you to see a show that is a smorgasbord of flamenco (which is what we saw)rather than just one singer or dancer since it really is much more interesting."

It was AMAZING - the tickets were abut 18 euros each, which felt steep at first, but were treated to not only a tour of the hall, but also an introductory presentation about the history of the building, a listen to the incredible organ used in the hall and a look in all the smaller rooms as well. It was well worth the money and were guided around by a very friendly and passionate tour guide, giving not just a boring, run-of-the-mill monologue about the place. The decor was immense; full of detail, stunning sculptures and incredible colours (mainly from the breathtaking glass ceiling in the center of the main hall) and to say it wasn't Gaudi puts into perspective that the city was not just about one man. Seriously unmissable."

The tour (the only alternative to attending a concert to see the venue), however, leaves a lot to be desired. Got the ticket online because it says it's 20% cheaper and it'd \"beat the queue.\" When I got to the Palau, I was like, What queue?! You could just get a ticket at the tiny ticket office, which itself is quite cute. The tour starts right on time. We are first ushered into the new Petit Palau building and told to watch a 10-min introductory video. The video was OK but I found it quite odd that watching a video counts towards the 50-min tour time. The tour continues as one would expect. We climb up the art nouveau stairs and enter the reception room (?). You can see through the partly stained-glass windows the 12 famous ceramic columns, each uniquely decorated in floral patterns evoking a sense of nature. But sadly they can't open the doors to let you take pictures. You can take pictures of them through the windows. We then enter the upper circle of the concert hall, which is as beautiful as seen in the pictures. The stories and inspirations behind the sculptures and symbolisms are all fascinating. But I felt that you could always read about them online. Was hoping we could at least enter the stalls to admire the famous skylight from right beneath it. But we were told that was also not possible. And ... that was the end of the tour.Overall, I felt the tour is so not worth 19 \u20ac. Gaudi's buildings charge about the same at what first seem extortionate prices but their audio guides are so well done you feel you get more than your money's worth. No offence to the guide (who was actually a lovely lady but who probably could not change the program), but for an actual guided tour, I expected something more exclusive that you could only see by joining, well, a guided tour! For example, the Radio City Music Hall tour in NYC covers every nook and cranny of the venue and you not only get to see backstage, but ON stage where all the legends once stood, and BELOW the stage to see how the hydraulic system works ... but I digress. My advice: forget the tour and attend a concert if you can! You will see so MUCH more!"

So we booked tickets for Beethoven's 9th Symphony on our recent trip to Barcelona. We booked tickets online prior to leaving home. The Palau website is fantastic, showing actual views from all types of seats in the theater. We had no trouble picking up our tickets at the box office which we did earlier on the day of the concert. I recommend this, because the line at the box office was quite long just prior to the performance. The building is amazing. I have never seen anything quite like it inside or out. The architecture is so interesting and beautiful. The concert was wonderful and the acoustics great. If you attend a concert, go a little early so that you can soak it all in. One little tip--if you don't have the time and/or money for a tour or concert you can get a very good idea of what the building is like by going into the lobby which is free to enter. There is also a restaurant there."

Do yourself a HUGE favor and spend just a few more Euros to attend a concert at the Palau de la Musica Catalana rather than just have a tour! My family had the privilege and absolute thrill to attend the concert on May 24th of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony (The Choral Ode to Joy), one of the greatest works of music ever written, in my opinion. As big classical music lovers, we were moved to tears by this stunning, exquisite performance by L'Orquestra Simfonica del Valles! We were speechless (even my 18 yr. old son!) after the endless applause brought about the most amazing encore I've ever witnessed, when the entire chorus and symphony repeated the final movement and the audience was invited to sing along with the chorus in Catalonia (the lyrics were printed in the program.) But aside from the unforgettable performance I have to say that this exceptional concert hall is the most beautiful and our favorite Modernista interior in Barcelona, hands down, truly a must see!! The ceiling is jaw-dropping with a kaleidoscopic skylight featuring a choir of angels singing around the sun; you can hardly take your eyes off this visual extravaganza! There is nothing to compare with this in the U.S. and probably the world. The evening spent at the Palau was the highlight of our trip to Barcelona. Do not miss it!"

Each one of the guitar Masters showed their extrodinary skills on a range of guitars. Combined with some comedy (who was that guy?) and the audience was up several times for a standing ovation!Initially we did not know where to book seats and in the end were on a side 'terrace' in what could almost be called a box. We selected these seats as we figured they would be chairs not fixed seats. With a young child we like to be able to move a bit in case our little one needs a lie down. For those with kids: the stalls are fixed and the arm rests do not move. Where we were there was some movement possible, but with 8-9 chairs jammed in our box, there was no leg room. No prams allowed inside but a big cloakroom to store in. Front row on any box has great view but in truth the whole venue is well designed and I don't think you will be disappointed where ever you select.As for the Four Guitars, I strongly recommend! The musicians are so talented we were cued up st the end to buy their CDs and have them autographed. Even our four year old stayed up for the whole show and then pretended to play guitar for days!"

I decided to book a performance in it to be able to see it and thought that would be the way to experience it and its beauty. The joke was on me, in that the performance I booked was in the little Pelau theater. I was terribly disappointed that I did not get to see the beautiful glass work that had so attracted me to the building. However, we truly enjoyed the concert of the students of the choir school.We later shelled out the 18 euros per person and took the basically one hour tour of the building to see it. It is a beautiful building. I am glad I saw it. I probably would not pay another 18 euros to see it a second time. We spent about ten to fifteen minutes of the tour watching a small film with some history and a lot of testimonials. We spent a little more time getting some background and history. We climbed two flights of stairs to see the room for resting between acts, which is a lovely light room with a view of the exterior columns and stained glass. Then finally we got to spend 15-20 minutes in the actual performance hall. It is ornate with massive sculptures at the front of the stage, muses painted on the back part of the stage and the beautiful stained glass chandelier like creation on the ceiling. It was beautiful and a treasure for Barcelonians. However, I think that if you like music, the best path may be to buy tickets to a concert. Otherwise, think of it as a contribution to the arts."

The show was from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm non stop. While there might of been a few moments of fatigue the show and theatre keep us alert.The band was led by an enthusiastic small man who clearly loved the music. The music was basically American- Duke Ellington , Louis Armstrong , Glenn Miller , Count Basie and others. The band had numerous solos and several of the members could really sing and ham it up. One performer sang the same song in English , Spanish and finally in Catalanan. At the end, the band leader sang a classic Louis Armstrong song that was dead on. If you get a chance while in Barcelona definitely book a show to enjoy the beauty if the theatre and a great show."

When someone writes \"a feast for the senses,an ecstasy of colour\" does this sound like a vivid description,without a doubt, of the most spectacular building in Catalan?... we;; in my opinion,it does. This building demonstrates the splendour and multifaceted culture of modernism. I think its deliciously over the top,the decorations overdone,yet nevertheless,it provides a gorgeous interplay of architecture,decoration and most importantly,a sensory stimuli. I am told, by my guide that it is no accident,that one of the most notable uses emanating from the building was that of a musical association which took on the task of preserving catalan songs and making them better known. The luxurious decor of the interior is so overpowering that its easy to overlook the architecture. I love the contrast between the red bricks and the colourful ceramicmosaics which dominate the exterior, with the walls broken up by window galleries,balconies with a web of pillars,arches and balustrades, all creating a veriety of visual associations, reminiscent for me, of the Venetian Palazzi,Tudor buildings and the delightful Moorish structures. Yet, between all the eclectic architecture,space is still found for a collection of sculptures,busts with the' big-boys',Bach,Beethovan And daddy-Wagner,sitting on a pedestal each.  We attended a lunchtime soiree which brought together the artistic elements in this unique space. the splendour of the audience's space is surpassed- only just - by the adornment of the prosconium,as well as, the decoration of the stage itself. Never have i felt more joy then within the confines of this truly magical place."

We were lucky enough to get box seats to a Flamenco performance and it turned out to be a highlight of our trip.The venue is small so the performance felt intimate. The performance, combined with the venue, made it a special evening.

The flamenco dancers (2 women and a man) were excellent! The accompanying 3 singers, 2 guitarists and a drummer were fantastic and we were in awe of the whole show."

Our group of four had the Palau medium-high on our list of sites we wanted to visit during our 4-day stay in Barcelona, but when I saw a poster for a concert there by classical guitarist Manuel Gonzalez, the deal was sealed. The concert hall is bedecked by Catalan Modernist sculpture, paintings and tilework by a host of Catalan artists, and the hall felt acoustically intimate. Senor Gonzalez play some standards of the Spanish repertoire as well as a couple of pieces in which he extended his virtuosity with humor. We hadn't heard of him before but my friend Al now owns his oeuvre on CDs. A truly gracious evening."

We had a tapas which was lovely. Then we climbed the ornate stairs to our balcony seats. Wow what a beautiful hall, took lots of pictures before the lights went down for the performance.

The tour is excellent and showcases several galleries and the main concert hall, along with the history of the building, the music showcased there through the ages and the cultural impact of current events during its history. One of the top three must-sees IMO in Barcelona - along with the Sagrada Familia and Casa Batllo. The entrance is a bit hard to find for the tour (versus the main entrance used for evening performances). The day tour entrance is not in what appears to the be \"front\" of the building (on Carrer de Sant Pere des Alt) but from the side (look for the glassed in walls around the left side from the front of the building) on Carrer del Palau de la Musica (across from the entrance to Explore Catalunya - which also offers excellent day and half-day tours)."

The only concert hall in the world that was (and still is) lit by natural light.The guides were knowledgeable and helpful, but not overbearing.The leaded windows are probably unique; the use of leaded areas on the edge of large expanses of plain glass is not common - Frank Lloyd Wright did this but with much more geometric patterns.The queueing system for tours worked well - we only had to wait twentry minutes. Park Guell, please take note!The shop and cafe looked to be well stocked but a little expensive - \u20ac35 for an umbrella, \u20ac13.90 for a glasses case.The main drawback seems to be it isn't on the list of the standard sights in Barcelona; until this visit I had never heard of it."

The acrostics is natural, and the hall can accommodate more than 2000 people. The main attraction is supposed to be the design, with beautifully decorated sculptures like flowers and horses. The hall tries to make use of natural light as much as possible. Other than that, I am not too impressed about the concert hall, maybe I have too high of an expectation. The waiting area is very crowded and the place is small, the service is very poor, and one has to wait a while before the tour starts. Very uncomfortable place to wait for the tour to start. The tour lasts an hour, just looking at the concert hall. There are many places In Barcelona I can think of to visit before I will visit this place.

Next, we were taken to the main concert hall and given ample time to take photographs before the explanation of the hall, the statuary, glass, inscribed composers' names, and organ. Also heard the organ music for a few minutes. Then we were taken to the second floor.I was asked if I needed an elevator as I had an injured foot. I never requested this; they made the effort to identify people needing the elevator. Greatly appreciated!

They run on the hour in varying languages, it's worth checking the schedule online - on a computer, as I couldn't load it on a phone! Or just pop in and try your luck.The video at the beginning of the tour was a little nationalistic and over the top, but an interesting perspective of the building's history. The only downside is I wish it was longer! But the building's staff seemed quite relaxed about letting you hang around and take pictures.If anything, I'd advise getting a ticket to see a matinee at this place. That way you get the full experience. On our tour we heard a snippet of the organ music and it was absolutely divine. Worth going."

I took the English tour at 10:00 AM which starts with the short video explaining the history of the place followed by the actual tour of the building. The entrance to the tour starts from behind the building near the cafe which is also the collecting point of the tickets. As I could not book it online due to website issue - I emailed them and got the tickets booked and received 10% discount. If you have Barcelona card you can get 20 % discount on these tickets. There is cafe/ toilet facilities available. The tour will take about 1 hour and with the thousands of photos opportunities can take upto 2 hours. The panorama shot of the ceiling looks awesome !

And what an amazing visit it was as the sun shone brightly that day making the whole theatre magical and alive with colours!The tour informs us of the history of the building and the journey it has travelled for over 100 years which we appreciate. Pictures do not do justice to the beauty here. To experience it, sit inside the theatre underneath the stained glass inverted dome, to touch the pretty mosaics decorating the pillars, to go upstairs and view the place panorama wise - truly sublime. It has become one of our favourite buildings in the world!"

We were heading towards the Picasso Museum when we came across this fabulous building, somewhat hidden in the small narrow streets in the gothic section of Barcelona. Our curiosity led us to inquire about taking a tour. Fortunately we were able to get tour tickets for an English speaking tour that very afternoon. Lucky for us, as we found out the next three days would have no tours offered. The tour starts with a short film as an introduction. The group was divided in half so everyone could hear and see the concert hall without any trouble. We were able to take photos, too. This has to be the lovliest building in all of Barcelona. We wish there had been a show while we were in Barcelona but we are so thankful that at least we got to see the inside of this remarkable concert hall. There is also a very nice cafe on the first floor and a gift shop. By the way, you must be on a tour or at a concert of some kind to see the concert hall. This is definitely a must see while in Barcelona."

They are very talented and performed arrangements of familiar orchestral works, with some humorous touches as well. A serious classical music lover might opt to see a different performance, but for a light and pleasant 90-minute concert during a vacation, their show was perfect. I would recommend seeing a concert there rather than taking the tour, so you see the theater as it was intended to be used."

The show was entertaining, we are not Flamenco experts.. but the overall historical, visual and acoustical experience was spectacular and unique. Bring a camera.

A child's idea of a fantasy theatre at its best ... A visual delight at every turn. Lights down, musicians seated ... Huge anticipation and then equally huge disappointment as we realized we would not be able to see anything! The dancers and musicians were at floor level and not on the stage! So our 70 Euros bought us, and many other attendees, a sight seen after perilously stepping out onto dark wooden stairs and standing for the entire concert. The music and dancers were fantastic, enthralling, amazing even, but standing on a step ( careful don't fall) to watch, was a huge frustration and disappointment. Before you buy a ticket make sure you are going to be able to see, if it is a performance where it matters. A music only performance would not have the same issues."

It is a visually beautiful venue but the tour did little to add to our experience.We would rate the tour a 2.We attended a Flamenco performance which we wish we had taken the time to understand a bit better. The dancers were wonderful, the guitarist and other musicians superb, the lead singers enjoyable but we clearly didn't understand the role of the secondary singers/shouters. Choose your concert carefully."

The agency gave us tickets to the concert at the Palau de la Musica Catalana. I am usually apprehensive about going to what sounds like a \"tourist attraction\", because you never know what you are going to get, i.e., in this case, no genuine Spanish classical guitarists. I was quite pleasantly surprised with the concert performance. The musicians, although not all Spanish, were very good, the staging very clever and funny, and it was done in very good taste. It did not matter to me so much as to my friends that the musicians were not all Spanish and that the program was not all classical Spanish guitar music - musical talents and ability to interpret are more important to me. It was a very enjoyable evening, and I was glad we went. The Palau is beautiful in its Gaudi way, so it was worth it to go to the concert and see the interior at the same time."

The colours and mosaics an over-the-top ornamentation just makes you smile!I still can't understand the glass columns - how do they hold any weight or how were they constructed?Faced with the choice of pay for a tour or go to a concert we opted for the latter and I'm sure many others there did the same (the audience seemed less familliar with concert etiquet than normal) and I'm very glad that we did! When we went to the box-office for tickets it was possible to go in the building to the cafe and you could get to see much of the building (if not the concert hall) for free if money is tight, but Barcelona is not really a great place to go if you don't have spare cash.But amazing as this building is I don't understand how it can be number one in the list of Barcelona attraction.

It turns out the last row is right backed up into the rear wall, and there is hardly any leg room. But it was for a session of the jazz festival, and the music was great.There are elevators, but (excuse the joke) they don't go all the way to the top. This is just a note to warn people to whom this is important. Also, during the concert, the elevators are locked. But if you need to go, the ushers will call the elevator operator to take you there (in my case the bathroom on the deluxe section)."

There is a little courtyard and a bar where you can have cava before and after the concert and during intermission. The sculptures hanging from the walls of the stage make any concert an out of this world experience. If the Orquestra de Sabadell is playing, you really must go. They're the ones that did the Ode to Joy flashmob. Google it. It's great!"

The most famous architect most likely is Gaudi, but the Palau de la Musica Catalana is designed by his contemporary Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner and he did amazing designs as well.The Palau can only be visited by guided tour, which lasts approximately one hour. Entrance fees are high, but this holds for all interesting buildings in Barcelona (no combination tickets available, only discount cards for many tourist attractions which require you lots of calculation and knowing upfront what you plan to do ...). Book your visit on-line. This works perfectly and you can select the language tour of your preference. The stain glass inside the building is amazing, but you'll be totally blown away by the huge lustre in the concert hall. There's no way to describe it, you'll just have to watch it yourself. Don't forget to walk 'around' the building as also the exterior is worth your visit. If you enjoy your visit to the Palau, also consider to visit Montaner's 'Hospital de Sant Pau' (guided tours only; last English tour around 1 pm)Metro station is around the corner."

We were a little reticent to pay 15 Euros each to visit but boy are we glad we did. The English tour was fabulous, lasted about an hour, you start with a short film on the history of the building and why it was created in the first place. You then tour the building marveling at the stained glass, the plaster work, and listen to the organ playing and the acoustics will knock your socks off! Amazing. We were blown away by the beauty of this building which is just a five minute walk from Las Ramblas and close to the Gothic quarter. You can probably buy tickets for less ahead of time on line but we kind of did it on the spur of the moment and we are very glad we did. There are nice clean toilets to use after the tour (which may sound like a strange thing to say but there are almost NO public toilets in Barcelona - you have to buy a coffee or a drink to use the toilets in the restaurants/bars and they even have security guards at KFC and McDonalds to STOP you using the toilets!) so take advantage of clean toilets after your tour and then enjoy a drink at the magnificent bar or a coffee in the coffee shop afterwards. Highly recommended."

Despite the over-priced entrance fee, we DID enjoy ourselves, and our tour guide DID recommend a great place across the street for lunch. Wheelchair access: There is an elevator in the back of the theater, but my grandmother (in her wheelchair) missed a significant amount of the tour while she waited for the elevator. Alas, our tour was interesting, and the theater was beautiful, my only complaint is the elevator and the price of tickets."

Tickets were 49 euros each (about $60 or so) and we thought the concert was to be at 8:30pm. We arrived at 8pm after a fairly long walk from our apartment in Barri Gottic. The tickettaker informed us the concert was at 10:30PM, not 8:30pm! We could hear the strains of a Strauss waltz as they have concerts back to back in the hall which is a wonderful use of the beautiful space. So we wandered around the gift shop, went for coffee, and returned to learn they had added an additional treat of the \"Moldau\" piece. Our seats were in the first balcony directly in sight of the pianist's flashing hands. During intermission, you just sit and gaze at the incredible design of the hall...the mosaicwork is amazing on the ceiling, the columns ornately decorated in a mass of colors, the main ceiling light surrounded by faces of beautiful \"heavenly women\"....and then throw in the incredible music performed by a Ukrainian Orchestra....a glorious evening and well worth the wait.

When we visited, there was a maximum of 55 people per tour. At the tour itself, there were only 20-30 people there. I think during the week, it's relatively calm.

Having said that, we were lucky to be on our tour when a young quartet were practicising for their performance later that night and we got to sit in and listen for about 15 minutes. So we did get the best of both worlds. One reviewer described it as 'Gaudi's Best'.....but this in fact is not Gaudi. The architect was a peer of Gaudi but very different in charactor and style. He was more open to designing according to requirements than Gaudi and created the theatre for a local choir master who wanted a home for his choir to perform in. So the acoustics were designed especially for the voice. The atmosphere is tangible as soon as you walk through the door. It is a building of beauty with a heart and soul."

The tour (including the film) took about an hour .I see the point of other reviewers who mention that you might as well just buy tickets for a concert at the Palau, because the guided tour does not lead via extra rooms then you will see if you go to a concert.The tickets are not exactly cheap. I paid 13,5 eur for the guided tour (and that was discounted ticket, as I used a voucher, normal price is 17 eur). For a concert, prices range from about 20 to 50 euro, depending on the concert and the seat you want. Nevertheless, I do not regret spending my money on the tour, as it was an easy way to know what I wanted to know about the Palau, plus gave me a chance to take plenty of pictures (without flash). I guess it all depends on what you want to see/do/know.To conclude : definitely one of the highlights of my stay in Barcelona!"

Many people were trying to get seats when we collected our tickets from the booking office.The theatre itself is worth seeing for the design and lighting alone. At times it looked like Gaudi had had a real go at the design.The concert itself was with a group of 6 musicians seated informally on the stage with a large piece of wood in front of them. It was on this that the Flamenco dancing took place. One man and one woman who were really good. There were two singers who came on at various times to sing operatic songs. So it was very mixed but extremely good. Would really recommend it."

This is a beautiful palace and I'm sure the tour would also be worthwhile, but I don't have any regrets missing it in place of attending a live performance.

The tour was disorganised and poor.Our tour began with a quick over view and a walk to a small lecture theatre where we were meant to be shown a 20 minute film which would give details of the Palaus Catalana. The walk to the theatre and the next fifteen minutes involved our tour guide arguing with the other staff about whether we could see the film or not. Apparently the lecture theatre which shows the film had been double booked. The silly part was that if we had of been shown the film, it would have taken about the same amount of time as the arguments about why we couldn't see it. The process was very unprofessional and embarrassing.The rest of the tour involved seeing the main theatre by sitting in the theatre seats. We were told who did the art work in the theatre area \u2013 it was seriously boring. I suggest that if you want to visit the Palaus Catalana, then you should book in for a concert as you will see the same areas of the building. The tour did not give access to any area of the building that can\u2019t be seen as a part of being in the audience of the show. The tour seemed pointless."

However we paid for a guided tour in English and were very disappointed. The guide had a strong accent which made understanding her difficult. She began her talk in each area as soon as the first five or six people reached the spot ignoring the fact that the next thirty people were still struggling up the stairs. At one point she used a painting to describe the theatre and talk about it's history - but only the front row could see the painting! Do visit the Palau if you are able to climb several flights of stairs - but do your own tour don't pay the extra for a guide."

We were third in line the day we arrived to buy tickets when the ticket seller announced that she had sold the last tickets for the last english language tour of the day. So we purchased tickets for the first english tour for the next day. We had the great fortune of our tour being conducted while rehearsals were occurring for a performance that evening. Now not only were we unbelievably blown away by the beauty of the building, now we have experienced the wonderful sound of the building. Clearly one of the main attributes of this building is the stunning skylight. The dedication of the people of Barcelona who were instrumental in building such a wonderful work of architecture cannot be underscored enough. I will always recommend a tour of the Palau de la Musica Catalana to anyone going to Barcelona. I would encourage people to even try to attend a performance if the timing is right."

The guided tour is totally a waste of time and money. - The first 20 minutes of the 50-minute guided tour was to sit in a room watching a video. The video wasn't informative but more like a promotional thing of the concert hall. These things you could probably find on youtube or wikipedia. Why would someone need to fly all the way there paying to sit in a room and watch this?- The rest of the guided tour was mostly about the architecture, but very very little about the music. The guide didn't seem to know much about music at all. She pointed at the seats in the first couple of rows and arbitrarily claimed that those were the best seats. However, anyone with some knowledge about concerts and concert halls should know that the front rows are never the best seats. Anything the guide mentioned about the place had very little to do with music. more related to history and the design of the building or its sculpture in it. Even so, it was not very informative and was not too interesting as there were just so many great architecture masterpieces in Barcelona to see. Sadly the component of music was very limited even though it was a guided tour of a Palace of Catalan \"Music\". The guided tour didn't even take us to the back stage or on to the stage. What is the point?! I have been to much better tours, for example Boston has this symphony hall tours on Saturday. It was 1000 times better than this one and was offered free, and was guided by volunteers! I cannot believe a professionally guided tour that cost 18 Euros could be in such a poor quality. Also, they do have student tickets, but this information is not listed anywhere. It is 11 (or 12) Euros but it is super inconvenient to get because the student tickets are not available online. Their reason is simply stupid -- there is no way they could know if you are really a student. come on! Everybody sells the student tickets online and check the ID at the entrance. Even so I still don't think it is worth going at all.Without doing the guided tour, the outside of the building is covered with some glass wall, so you can't really see the building. what's the point?! This place is simply not worth going. There are a lot more places to see I am sure you will regret spending your time here."

I can only say that it is a rare gem and deserves the accolades it has received here from others.

It will be much hated by those who love minimalism and its opulence could be seen by many as distracting, however it is both an architectural and artistic delight. Book on line to save queuing for tickets and the guided tours are well worth it. Photography is permitted but without flash."

The price for a guided tour is pretty steep (around 25 dollars) but really worth it. We had great tour guide who worked the crowd well. She added some Catalan history as well. I was staying at the Hotel Casa Fuster which was done by the same architect so it was a pleasant coincidence. The tour includes a recorded organ section which was really nice and you visit all aspects of the theater. I would have loved to see a concert but our schedule did not allow."

If booking tickets to see the Gran Gala Flamenco show it really is worth paying extra for 'good seats'.Despite paying 33 euro per person for seats in the second floor stalls the view was limited, when booking online you can see a view of the stage from the seats you are booking, this is fine but when there are people in front of you due to the layout of the building / height of the rows it means your view of the stage can be quite limited.Luckily there was no-one behind us for a few rows and I spent most of the show propped up on the top of the fold down seat, there were plenty others doing the same with some even standing for the duration of the show.Photography is prohibited during the show but this doesn't stop some from continually snapping away with flash.Now to the show - absolutely incredible, once it started I regretted not paying more for seats close to the front. Normally I would give a lower rating due to the seating but the show was so excellent (once I got a view) that I couldn't give it any less than the highest rating available.The Palau building itself is absolutely stunning and also well worth a visit if you have the time."

Everyone asks about, talks about, raves about Gaudi, but from my perspective, if you want to see the finest example of that style, go to a concert in, or take a tour of the Palau de la Musica Catalana. Better yet, do both!I\u2019d been warned that one must book in advance for this architectural highlight of anyone\u2019s stay in Barcelona, designed by the modernista architect many judge as more than Gaudi's equal, Lluis Domenech i Montaner. But a check or three on line told me that I might just be able to show up a bit early and get in on the tour \u2013 lo and behold, I was right!The fifty minute tour of the extraordinary Palau de la Musica Catalana was, one of the very favorite hours I spent on my trip to Spain. It was built by funds collected locally for a revered group of singers, the Orfeo Catala, who had no proper venue in which to perform. I find that I don't have words that can do justice to this building, but I will attempt to paraphrase what the guide said to us on the tour. She noted (and others greater than her noted it as well in the excellent short film shown at the beginning of the tour) that the building unites the art of architecture with the performing arts in too many ways to count or relate. It also unites in a unique manner science with the arts, as the complex technique it took to design and build the palace seem apparent and essential when you're inside it. This is perhaps not apparent in photos but in person I can attest to it. The building seems to have a music of its own, that harmonizes with and supports the music being played in it. A highlight of the tour is the \"playing\" of the organ. I don't understand the technical aspects, but a fine organist played several pieces on the organ that can be re-played electronically, and the guide did so as we sat in the auditorium. I've never heard organ music like it, and this was so in part because of the organic connection/relationship between hall and music. A must-see in this extraordinary city!"

Be sure to do the tour if you have time since it gives you behind-the-scenes access to all parts of the Palau and you get great information on the history. It's also a lot of fun if you can catch a show here (though honestly the acoustics aren't the best). It's also pretty inexpensive. A staple to the standard Barcelona trip for good reason."

There was ample time to take photos of the beautiful palau and to listen to the organ being played.The Flamenco show was amazing and I enjoyed every bit of it. I bought the tickets on their online site which was very easy and you just picked the tickets up on the day of the show from their ticket office. My only regret is picking a seat at the lateral stalls - whilst you can still see most (if not all) the dancing from the side, the view sometimes gets obstructed by your fellow viewers leaning forwards in their seats. The view from the centre would have definitely augmented the enjoyment of the show so I'd advise spending a little more to get seats in the centre."

Not worth \u20ac33 a ticket!"

I attended a concert in the evening. I would however be careful what concert to go and see. The one I went to was by a solo guitarist. He was obviously very talented but perhaps too technical for my taste. Not being an expert on Spanish guitar or too familiar with that type of music, it all felt too monotonous too me. I actually fell asleep during the concert. When I finally woke up, I looked around and counted no less than 10 other people fast asleep!! Unless you are a true fan of Spanish guitar, for an evening's entertainment I would stick to a flamenco show or perhaps a performance by more than one artist so it won't feel all the same. Overall, I would definitely recommend visiting the palace and attending a concert. Just make sure you would enjoy the type of performance on hand."

We went to see 2 concerts, the Barcelona 4 Guitars and Flamenco. The performers themselves were first class. We had discounted tickets (27 euro) for the 4 Guitars and had seats in the side balcony. The view was restricted but not told this at time of booking at the theatre itself. Spent a lot of time craning our necks to see the performers and ended up standing to see the guitarists play. For the Flamenco we opted to pay a whopping 48 euro and got seats in the stalls. THIS WAS EVEN WORSE. The seating is only slightly elevated from row to row. Nothing but heads in front of us blocking the view of the stage. I did a lot of head swinging trying to see the show. With Flamenco you want to see the footwork but it was impossible from where we were sat. Couldn't even see some of the performers.Got so frustrated after paying so much I left in disgust. If you decide to go to this theatre BE VERY CAREFUL about which seats you book. The front row in the stalls or front row in the balconies, directly facing the stage are the only ones I would consider if I went back. Don't forget this is an old theatre and designed when people were not so tall. I think the management need to consider elevating the seating, maybe the stage and be honest about \"restricted views\" - just like we do in Britain. The poor seating doesn't give justice to the artists that perform there. PALAU DE LA MUSICA let all the audience see your brilliant performers PLEASE. My husband and I gave you 150 euro - a lot of money. You need to improve the seating when taking that amount of money from people."

The acoustics are amazing considering the hall contains huge glass window. The musican was great. Only complaint is that you need to be very close to the center line or in a box to not have to sit at an uncomfortable angle (similar to almost all concert halls) - the seating chart did not show my seats as being on mostly on the side. I should have waited to book this when we got to Barcelona as the Aerobus and Touristic bus had 10%15% off coupons and the event was only about 2/3 full.Also nice food (and drinks) available for purchase before and after event."

When we got there, there were PLENTY of tickets still available and it was not needed to buy tickets ahead of time (at least not on a Thursday). I paid 35 Euros for 2 tickets online when I could have paid less for student tickets at the door. To put that in perspective I only paid 34 Euros for 2 tickets to the Sagrada Familia! If I had to do it again, I definitely wouldn\u2019t pay that much to see this place. You start by watching a short film about the hall and its history. Then they take you to the bottom of the main hall, and then up the stairs to get a view from the top level. The coolest thing about this place is the glass ceiling chandelier \u2013 it\u2019s awesome. The light coming through it is amazing. It\u2019s truly a work of art.

It was a great experience to kick off our visit! --A few points: they aren't so strict about start time. They sound a bell 3 different times, warning bells. They also still let people come in after the show starts (disruptive when the people have seats in the middle of the row--should've had them sit in one of the 100s of empty seats...). Seats are close together and walkway is tight (read: once you sit, no room in front of your knees). If you get stuck behind someone tall, you may have a neckache from trying to see around them.

The Palau de la Musica Catalana is rather underrated compared to all the Gaudi work in Barcelona, which is a shame as it's my favourite attraction in Barcelona. We took an english guided tour which took us inside to admire the auditorium. The stunning stained glass dome is truly amazing, as is the mosaics throughout the interior. We were very lucky to have a lovely guide that was very passionate about Palau and he was informative and friendly. The downside to this attraction is that we were not allowed to stay inside after the tour ended, which meant that you need to make the most of your time inside and take as much photos as you can. A rather expensive tour at around 17 euros, but it is worth it and I recommend this attraction to everyone."

The concert hall is beautiful. A must see. The tour is highly recommended. There are some stairs, but elevators are available. You first view an introductory video in the newer hall. Later, you sit in the concert hall and hear a little bit of the organ. Then, go up to the balcony seats to view more of the hall. So, not much walking aside from the stairs.To complete your Montaner experience, I recommend having lunch at nearby Hotel Espana on Sant Pau. Their Fonda restaurant was designed by Montaner. The set lunch menu of water, wine, appetizer, entree and dessert is 26 euros. The food and service are excellent. You could be seated right next to the walls with his tiles. A very beautiful room. The hotel also provides a daily free tour of the building."

At the end of the concert, all audience were not able to stop applauding *standing ovation*, which forced Manuel to come back on stage to play a very unique piece, he called \"interrupted romance\" where he played a mix from almost all romantic symphonies with interruption from famous new rock songs - on the guitar. It was very humorous, funny and showed great deal of professionalism and skills on Manuel's side to pull this piece off to end the concert where everyone was very excited and happy to attend including our young kids!!"

Every bit of the design has a lot of symbolic representation. My favourite part would have to be the central skylight, made of stain glass, which is in the shape of an inverted dome.It would be great to attend a concert here - maybe next time.One has to book a tour in order to be able to enter all the rooms of the premises, and its definitely worth the time and cost.

If possible and if it's your thing..check out the program and take in a concert. Absolutely put this on your list of things to see."

The building is magnificent and the architecture is breathtaking. It has been completely restored and it is well worthwhile going for a visit - tours are also available during the day. The concert by the four classical guitarists was also excellent and was very much enjoyed by the audience. The musicians were extremely talented and the beautiful music was also done with some humor which was very cleverly introduced into the program. We had a quick dinner at a nearby restaurant, Gino's on Via Laietana. The food was very good and prices reasonable. Our waitress made sure we were finished in time to make our 8:00 pm concert. Both the concert hall and the restaurant are a five minute walk from Placa Catalunya. All in all, an unforgettable evening!"

As a fan of Art Nouveau and stained glass, the Palace de la Musica Catalana was just magical. I booked to see the only performance that fitted my schedule, a flamenco concert. Other reviewers have commented that you should see a symphony here, but I didn't have that luxury. Seeing the concert was only a little bit more expensive than just doing a guided tour of the hall -- and as a venue purpose built for watching performances, its probably the best way to see it. The flamenco was great despite other reviewers being critical of it being 'touristy' (hell, I'm a tourist after all!). Being inside the hall to watch the light change to night through the glass was wonderful . Get there early for reasonably priced pre-dinner drinks (or coffee) and soak in the ambiance. A Barcelona highlight not to be missed."

Tickets cost from 33 to 42 EUR (June 2013) and the best option to buy online at their own web-site http://www.palaumusica.cat/en/ where you can chose your seat Unfortunately, tickets bought online have to be collected at their ticket office anyway, so we had to went there twice (ticket office is open till 9.00 p.m., show starts at 9.30 p.m., probably one can do everything at once)"

After an amazing Tapas at the Ohla Hotel nearby, all I can say is WOW. The hall is truly spectacular but to see Flamenco in its purest form alternating with soprano and tenor arias was over the top. This was so much more than just an evening out. We left for home the next morning with memories of a fantastic Barcelona evening. Can't wait to go back! Highly recommended."

I visited the Palau upon the recommendation of some friends and was glad that I did.The price is not cheap for the length of the tour- I think it was 17 or 18 euros for slightly less than an hour. You can buy tickets in advance, and all visits are with a guide, so you have to buy tickets with a guide in the language of your choice. It is pretty neat that this place is privately owned by the choir association, and was for the most part built and maintained by private funds.Frankly, I thought the movie they showed at the beginning went a little too long. It WAS interesting to hear the history of the construction of the Palau and how it came to be, but there were far too many snippets of stars simply talking about how great it was. Well, if it was not that great, I wouldn't have come. For that, I took off one star.But the visit inside was great. The tour guide brought us down to the bottom of the lower level, and gave a good explanation of the sculptures and art work inside. They even played a piece from the organ so that you can hear the outstanding acoustics.We were then able to go up to the balcony, where you get another perspective and a closer view of the outstanding colorful central glass-stained skylight that is absolutely beautiful.This used to be a venue that you were NOT allowed to take pictures in. Now, you cannot use a flash or movie camera, but you can take photos without a flash, so at least you can preserve your memories.All in all, despite the price/time ratio, I would still recommend a visit for some perspective into an institution that is very important in the lives of those in Catalunya."

My wife loved the decor and use of ceramics with glass to produce such wonderful lighting with shapes and colour. I was in awe of the architect who has used diffusion with constantly changing irregular surfaces within a parabolic space to provide a stunning auditory experience. With glass, plaster and tiles there should be so many reflections it ought to sound awfully high range and tinny, instead the notes are mellow and rich. Bravo Lluis Domenech i Montaner!Well worth a visit for either the tour or a performance."

You can see it only on tours. The tour price is 17 EU. That made me raise my eyebrows a bit. But I was 100% happy that I went on the tour, and I only regretted that we did not have time to see a performance. I would return to Barcelona (for visit #3) solely to see live music at the Palau.Details on the tour: it lasts about one hour. English tours seem to be at 10, 11, etc. (a French tour began at 10:30). Most of the folks on the English tour were not native English speakers, and they seemed to enjoy it as much as I did. The tour begins with a 15-minute video that is very professionally done. It includes interviews with just absolute top-notch musicians describing how much they love performing here.Great history of the place, beginning with the \"orfeos\" (amateur choral societies from the latter half of the 19th century) and then the architects who made some just amazing decisions in the building and later remodeling of the space. It's nice to realize that there were architects other than Gaudi doing interesting things in Barcelona!"

Anyway this is a truly outstandingly beautiful place and photos will not do it justice, The guide was extremely good, her English perfect. She didn't rush or hurry us, letting everyone take in the beauty at a leisurely pace, I've been to some places where they just whisk you through a room and tell you not to loiter.

Through their site, I was able to find different performances by orchestras, soloists and in between at different venues during my stay. For the Palau de la Musica, the orchestra was performing two Concertos by Bach for the first part and then the Four Seasons by Vivaldi. Mr. Zennaty was the guest violinist for the performance. Tickets were easy to arrange and a visit to is not to be missed. The performance was outstanding. I would note that tickets purchased ahead of time are distributed in an area of the bar that isn't readily spotted. The Palau management could do a better job of directing visitors to the will call table. Highly recommended."

The doors opened about 30 minutes before showtime and I have never seen more people rushing around taking pictures at any musical event I have been to in my life. The reason, of course, is the stunning architecture of this building. It is literally breathtaking! From the stain glass ceiling to the terracotta figures that ring the stage, no other concert hall has this kind of ornate, intricate and inspiring design features. By all means, take the tour, as I'm very sure it will be worth it. But with literally hundreds of events available on an annual basis, I strongly recommend taking in a concert, where you can enjoy Spanish/Catalan culture at its finest, in its finest venue."

You can see the outside and entry level of the building for free, but you need to pay for a guided tour to see other parts of the building, in particular the auditorium with beautiful stained glass.Book your tour in the ticket office to the left of the entry; they have screens to tell you when the tours are for each language and how many places are left on each. As they restrict the tour size, I had to book for a later time slot and come back or there is a cafe and gift shop on the entrance level you could spend the waiting time at.The tour starts with a professional video presentation of the history of the Palau and then a guide takes you upstairs. Oliver was very informative and entertaining, summarising the Modernist movement in a way that made me appreciate and understand the building. The auditorium is stunning. Go see it."

What a spectacular feast for the eyes, ears and soul! For the very reasonable price of 13 Euro, this 1 1/2 hour tour was absolute magic! This unique, picturesque marvel had it's humble beginnings back in 1908 when the then local acapela choir needed a home. Every beautifully decorated ceiling, column, stage, organ and window tells an incredibly deeply loved story. The absolutely extraordinary stained glass ceiling is a sight you will not have seen before and never will again. Splendiferous in fact. Words cannot explain the beauty of this extraordinary tribute to international music.The tour takes you through the rehearsal rooms, the history, the ground floor of the theatre - with a fantastic explanation of the vividly exciting mosaic stage proscenium. Then you move upstairs via a spectacular reception/green room - to the 'dress circle', where the 7,735 piped organ bursts into song - giving visitors a tantalising taste of the brilliant sound this marble and glass architectural wonder reveals. This is all done by a computer, as the engineers realised that by programming the organ with certain pieces of music, it provides both a treat for visitors and exercises every one of the pipes, pushing the air through to avoid dust and pollution build up - pure genius! This wondrous musical palace holds over 300 concerts every year hosting musicians of every international flavour - orchestral, rock, Broadway theatre even dance troupes. Homage is paid to every great musician by rock carvings, paintings, or artwork - Chopin, Beethoven etc. Truly a Catalan treasure that leaves every local and international visitor completely totally awe stuck!

Unfortunately we bought tickets for an Austrian male voice choir, with about 80 boys and 5 adult singers. There was an orchestra, but they only played a few notes between the warbling. We really should have researched better: it was awful. We stayed until the first break and then made a sharp exit to go check out the nearby awesome church instead. I would recommend a trip to the Palau, but be sure if you go to see a show, to research - as the quality is not guaranteed. Building and potential for an amazing evening - awesome.Our evening - awful.Or at least it was, until we sneaked out way out!"

The special part was that we were treated to 3 encores with soloists and full choir - I think the concert finished at about 11.15pm. A very special experience and very Catalan. The sound quality was very close and intimate making the prokofiev we heard very loud! The only slight caution is that tickets are not cheap. but worth it in our view."

Both the inside and outside are attractive. The stained glass ceiling in the concert hall is breathtaking, as the outdoor pillars and the concert hall backdrop (the sculptures of the 9 muses). Good to visit during the day due to the natural lighting within the concert hall (huge stained glass windows and ceiling).The guided tour is limited to max. 55 people each. What we liked was that they allowed you to browse on your own after the end of the official tour - great for taking photos without the crowd.Good tapas bar - opens late, until after the end of our evening concert (11pm ish).

In retrospect (and in my opinion), the performance was not a 'must see', but the interior of the Palau de la Musica Catalana was!. Intricate Tiffany glass ceiling and wonderful mosaic designs on the columns - beautiful."

I still can't believe we spent 100 euro on 4 buildings (including this one and 3 Gaudi's), but had I to do over again I would do it in a heartbeat. First off, buy the ticket in advance. We did this just a few hours before we wanted to go, once we knew what our itinerary was for the day. Don't feel obligated to do it days in advance and then feel trapped into your itinerary - booking the day of is fine. Unfortunately, you can't view this site on your own, but you must go with a tour. First, you walk around the lobby and see the staircases and side rooms which are nice. Next, we went on the main floor seating area and they had everyone sit down while the guide talked. I was able to get up and walk around wherever I wanted to take photos, but not many did this, so it was nice. We were down there at least 20 minutes, we had great views of the dome on the ceiling from where we sat. I thought the views were great until we went up to the 2nd level - WOW! Again everyone sat in the seats while the guide spoke, and the view of the stained glass fixture is just stunning. It took a decent amount of time to get people out of the way in order to get a photo with our friends with no one in it, but it eventually happened. Unfortunately the person that took our picture forgot to get the stained glass dome in it. :( From being on this tour and viewing the interior, I could only imagine what a performance here would be like. Next time we're visiting I will seriously consider going to s performance here."

Built around 1905 by architect Dom\u00e8nech i Muntaner, it is designed in the baroque-modernist style that resembles Gaudi. For me, this is even better than any of Gaudi's buildings: more subtle and refined and much less touristy. The outside is fantastic, but I strongly recommend a visit inside, attending a concert or not: look at the incredible stained glass inverted cuppola, the ornaments in the ceiling, the statues, the columns.. it's like a jungle of ornaments.You will be transported to a magic place, specially if you are there at a concert."

Because there was already an opera house in Barcelona (Gran Teatre del Liceu), this phenomenal art nouveau folly was built only for concerts, specifically those by a men's choral group, Orfeo Catala. Designed by Lluis Domenich Montaner, who did nothing else of equal merit, it was constructed between 1905-8. The ornate facade uses practically every material known to man and makes Gaudi look conservative. The columns above the main entrance represent a forest. Inside the auditorium, stained glass windows let in natural light and there's another stained glass feature on the ceiling, which represents the sun. There are huge clusters of sculpture above the proscenium and a couple of flying horses emerging above the circle. At the back of the stage more sculptures (muses playing instruments) burst through the walls. A recurring motif, inside and out, is glass balusters, which I'd never seen before. Sightlines and acoustics are said to be superb; our tour included a brief organ recital. This must be one of the most inspiring performance spaces in the world. Re-modelled and enlarged 1991. Beware! It's almost impossible to get a good photo of the exterior because the building is situated on such a narrow street. Just look for the crowds of people gawping upwards."

Literally.The place is SO beautiful and the coloured glass looks so amazing \u2013 it is overwhelming.The guided tour continues with some explanations about the venue and the usage of sunlight to light the entire theater.We then had a short piece of music being played by the computer on the pipe organ.

The tour is a bit expensive, but the guide was great and informative. The stained glass is beautiful and it the hall has some interesting features that you learn about in the tour. It is too bad that the front facade of the building is facing a narrow street as it is difficult to fully appreciate it. During the tour, you learn why that is, though...

When you go to the second floor, you see many of the textures up close. This is very much a tourist attraction for those who want to see modernista architecture. If you are not into modern architecture, there are much better ways to spend your time and money. I must admit that I have a personal bias towards the architecture of many of the older cathedrals in Barcelona, but it is interesting to see some of the best examples of this modern period."

I was intrigued to hear what acoustic a building with all this Modernista splendour would produce. Purposely built to be as broad as it is high, the concert hall did not disappoint. One could easily catch the nuances from all of the instruments in a performance of The Four Seasons. And over the efforts of the orchestra, three dimensional representations of musicians watched, as horses swirled still higher into the roof and the russet-hued glass ceiling stood above them all. Do visit but not at the expense of other architectural delights in Barcelona which should score at least as well in the Trip Advisor listings."

Finally, booking a day in advance we were able to secure a place during our visit in November. It is required to book a tour with their guides if you want to see the theater of the Palace of Catalan Music. The price came to \u20ac34 which was a bit steep for such a small sight and short tour. We started by being forced to watch a cheesy slow-paced video about the history of the palace, then our guide took us to two different levels of the theater. Although the guide was good, speaking excellent English, the fact that there were around 30 people in our group made her speak more like a street performer. To be honest the Palace of Catalan Music would be better off presenting this place with more dignity, giving visitors the option to visit on 20 minute intervals on their own, with/ or without recorded audio guides. They made such a big fuss over having their own guides and really this along with the video are not necessary to really appreciate the beauty of this sight."

I could happily have spent hours just admiring the grandeur of its architecture - the attention to detail is simply stunning, and knowing a little of its history made the experience really poignant. However, my last-minute, impulsive decision to attend a concert here on my last night in Barcelona was definitely one of the best decisions of my trip. Interestingly, on that night, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra was in town to perform a Mahler symphony as part of a European tour - and it was absolutely amazing. The orchestra was in fine form, the soloists were magnificent, the audience was great, the setting was perfect, and it was all just beautiful beyond words. On a quirkier note, as I walked away from the venue after the concert was over, I could hear some members of the orchestra singing 'Uptown Girl' from the room where they were (presumably) relaxing after their performance. That was a really cool moment and put a huge grin on my face. On the whole, it was truly a night to remember, and I would love to attend a concert here again someday."

The building itself is one of the most beautiful structures I have ever seen. Even the snack bar, which served delicious tapas, was an architectural marvel with vaulted ceilings and wonderful tile work. The interior is unbelievably beautiful with every surface decorated with more incredible tile work and the concert hall itself outdid everything else with its amazing stained glass ceiling, and sculptural decoration around the stage and mosaic murals combined with sculpture as a backdrop to the stage. We were lucky enough to get tickets to a Spanish guitar concert with four talented musicians known as \"Four Guitars\". Well worth the price of admission. This building is a must-see in Barcelona and it impressed me even more that the Gaudi buildings which are incredible in their own right. Breathtaking is the best word I can use to describe it."

I'm so glad we did both, as there is no info when you go to a performance, and the tour is well worth the time & $. For the performance we were lucky enough to enjoy flaminco dancers, but the real treat was the music, a strange mix of keening/wailing/singing with a pair of wonderful guitars. The only dis was the quality of food/wine from their cafe while waiting for the theater to open."

Went to the \"tourist\" guitar show - wow - they were great players and the \"patter and side show\" were amusing, clever and about the right note. If you see the guitar concert, hope you get treated to \"Bolero\" - I won't spoil it, but superbly played and amazingly orchestrated. Both the ensemble numbers and the solos were well worth the price of admission, but eat and drink elsewhere - a simple gin and tonic was $13! The bar looks great, and the tapas enticing, but mucho dinero. The building not only has history, it is history. Bring your camera and use the loo early as the lines are long during intermission. But I will tell my friends to take the tour and see a show. Worth it."

There is a cute cafe area in the Palau where you can sit and have a relaxed coffee and then browse through the beautiful gift shop. However, you are better off buying souvenirs from other locations in the city as the same ones can be found for cheaper elsewhere.The concert and the walk around the Palau were once in a lifetime experiences and we recommend you don't leave Barcelona without hitting up this gem."

The box office staff were really nice and helpful in changing an online reservation that I had made. The guided tour was very informative and they apparently recently changed their policy so you can now take pictures inside during the guided tour. I don't want to give away too much - but the uniqueness and creativity of the art work, glass and mosaics is incredible. The acoustics are tremendous - if you can go to a concert here, definitely do it."

We booked the 1-hr English language tour before leaving for Barcelona, and were so glad we did. The building and concert hall is stunningly beautiful. The 1 hour tour is just right - a decent introductory film, guide gave good, concise information, and allowed for picture taking time. It would be fun to book concert tickets here too - but sit in the front, up on the balcony so you can stare at the beautiful ceiling."

On the morning of 13 October we bought tickets for a concert that evening. When we arrived in the evening we were told that the concert was cancelled. No reason was given. The box office declined to refund the money that we had paid in the morning, but took our e-mail address. Three days later we got an e-mail claiming that the Palace of Music could not refund our money as the concert was promoted by a third party, to whom we were referred - and from whom we await a refund more in hope than expectation.What did the Palau do wrong? 1. They failed to give an honest explanation (or indeed any explanation) of the reason for the cancellation. 2. They agreed with the concert promoters to sell tickets on their behalf, but seemingly failed to agree that they could give refunds on those tickets on behalf of the promoters if the concert did not take place. 3 They failed to offer any sort of compensation of their own - such a free guided tour - despite the fact that they clearly make a lot of money out of these concerts, the ticket prices for which would seem ridiculous in any other building. Overall their attitude to us as concert-goers and (indirect) customers was shoddy."

Don't be put off if you walk round the building to your left and continue up you come to an entrance where you can book tours and the main entrance is via a piazza adjacent to this. The tours are in various languages so depending on what language you speak you may have to wait or come back later. The interior is fascinating full of light and colour and the history was really interesting. Hope to go back and see a concert next time we visit the city"

Probably the most beautiful music hall in the world, the Palau is worth both a tour (English offered regularly, but reserve) and a return for a concert. The hall was commissioned by the local choral society in the late 1890s and was designed by one of Barcelona's top modernista architects, Domenech y Montaner. Think Spanish art nouveau, with fabulous stained glass and tile work, all best seen during a daylight tour. The 50-minute tour consists of a 15-minute, high quality video, a well-led visit to different areas of the hall, an organ demonstration, and Q&A. The ground floor cafe is notable for its architecture and good pastries, tapas, and coffee--a nice place to mull on the wonderful architecture and decor."

The concert and the music were superb: he was charming and informative and playful all at once. The acoustics were great.The crowd was enthusiastic.I just felt I was having one of those night that you will always remember in a magical setting.

The popular Opera y Flamenco show is performed in here a few times a week as well; for this it's best to get a seat either on the ground level or the central section on Floors 1 or 2 as it can be difficult to see from the sides."

If you hang back then you miss the chat and explanation.

On a different note there was a young wheelchair user in the group and the place was well equipped for this so buggies wouldn't be a problem either."

The outside of the building was stunning and I so wanted to go inside, but there was no time to investigate further as I was catching a cruise ship that afternoon. When my husband and I began planning a cruise that would depart from Barcelona in September 2012, I knew that Palau de la Musica Catalana would be a \"must see\" on our itinerary. I was able to purchase tickets on line for the morning that we arrived in Barcelona and I must say that the price was very reasonable and the tour was well worth it. Interesting that, as the guide explained, part of the outside design concept was to make people want to come inside. It really worked for me! The inside was incredibly beautiful - my husband got some wonderful pictures and we both were so happy that we took the tour.

If you are a student of architecture or just someone that admires a work of art, you must see this building. You will appreciate the amount of artistic work that went into this building. The tremendous glass skylight, the glass walls and the small tiles (some attributed to Gaudi or school of Gaudi I believe) throughout this building add up to a well spent hour touring this World Heritage site.

We went for a Flamenco performance which we booked a week in advance on line.The pick up is a bit confusing, at a box office across the courtyard from the main entrance. Stood in the wrong line for a while before realizing...The performance was very intense and energizing, great live music and beautiful dancing.The space itself is very unusual and ornate, some elements are quite beautiful, some over the top.The combination of the space and performance was a winner for us."

We enjoyed good seats in the theatre (Primer pis; Butaques centrals, Fila:1; Butaca:6) for 29 Euro/person. There was plenty of time to look at the theatre before and after the concert. It's difficult to describe the symbolism and good acoustical design built into this venue for music. It all works to glorify classical music and reward those who keep this art form alive. Tip: If you think you might want to buy something in the gift shop, make your purchases prior to the start of the concert. Gift store and cafe were busy before the concert but closed after. We were deeply disappointed to miss our chance to buy a music box we had been playing with before the concert."

The concert hall has the most amazing stained glass skylight and is the only auditorium in Europe to be illuminated in daylight by natural light. The concert-goers were nicely dressed and we felt this added to the surroundings and sense of occasion. We enjoyed the flamenco performance but I would personally not really describe it as a \"gala\". Having said that, it was reasonably priced and the performers clearly passionate about their art. I would definitely recommend going to the Palau for an evening."

While it was on our list to see, it wasn't a priority until one day we were handed a brochure advertising an upcoming flamenco dance concert that was being held at the Palace of Catalan Music. We decided to go to the Palace of Music the next day and got there just before the last tour at 3:30 p.m. which was given in Spanish. As my husband is studying Spanish, it worked out well. Although I didn't understand what was said, the beauty of the building spoke for itself. According to the schedule, English tours are given on the hour starting at 10 a.m. You need to take the tour to see the building. The architecture, the stained glass dome, the stage itself - even the cafe and small gift shop - everything is unique. While there, you feel as though you've been transported back to a different time. We had seen flamenco in Seville and were fairly disappointed with the performances, so if you have the opportunity to see flamenco dance or any concert at the Palace, be sure to go there."

The building was just SPLENDID! Enjoy roaming and looking at all of the architectural details! Also, we made a point to eat early and rush there; we didn't realize there was a lively cafe in the the lobby...perfect for a small meal before the show if you are on the rush!

I don't know what other shows are like, but the one we saw was terrible, as the musicians and even the opera singers were amplified through a sounds system that was loud and distorted; given the size of the hall and the nature of the musicians, no amplification was needed at all and it completely spoiled the performance."

Besides Gaudi, Barcelona has many other fantastic things to see, Palau de la Musica Catalana is one of the must see you should not miss.Strongly recommend to buy the tickets for a guided tour in English via their online system in advance to guarantee your seats. it's a very popular scenic spot. The guided tour has limitation of visitors and it is always fully booked.A good news is that it allows to take photos now. What a great news! No one can be immuned to the beauty of this hall! You will keep saying WOW....The guided tour takes 55 minutes, which starts with an inspiring movie which gives you the history and background info.Later, the guide speaking good English, will show you around the odeum with very detailed introductions.The building is just like a fancy palace with all kinds of amazing decorations. Stage is not big, however, the statues of goddess behind is very vivid and living. The most eye-catching is the colorful glass ceiling, just like a sun, shining over your head, let the natural sunshine in and covering every corner of the hall, bright, warm and peaceful.During our trip, we were so lucky that a group of choir from Califonia who visited Palau de la Musica Catalana together with us, requested to sing a song for us in this amazing historical odeum. Of coz, they were warmly welcomed! Very beautiful song! We enjoyed so much and gave them a big applause. This also addes up to the highlights of our trip in Barcelona.I took the video for them, you may click the link as follows.http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/UGRRU_PSGlg/If anyone from the choir see my review, pls accept our appreciation for you providing us with such nice experience!

They weren't inexpensive but worth every penny. The Palau is absolutely stunning, you don't know where to look first. The pictures don't do it justice. It is relatively small, intimate . . . and indescribable. The flamenco show featured a man and two women who performed solo and in man/woman couplings, and they were all excellent.

Not this place; it cannot be rendered in words or pictures - you have to be there. It is an ineffable part of Catalan history that adds context to other aspects. It is hard to imagine that a trip to Barcelona could be considered complete without visiting the Palau.We were fortunate enough to be able to see a (really quite superb) concert performance there. This is of course the best way to experience the Palau. Online purchase of tickets was simple and accurate.Be sure to allow enough time to sit with a pre-concert drink in the lower lobby area; read the parts of Robert Hughes' book that relate to the Palau, and reflect on the vision that gave birth to this space over 100 years ago."

The stuff she was telling us was interesting and it adds to your appreciation of the building's 'glow-worm' and the pillars next to the stage and Catalan history and identity. Most of the building has been financed with private money by the Catalonians, for the Catalonians and other music lovers. Plan ahead, as sometimes an English spoken tour isn't for another few hours. There's plenty to do in the meantime, but if you're on a tight schedule for whatever reason, planning is advisable."

The Palace of Catalan Music offers a number of English tours and has a box office you can buy tickets as well as concert tickets for for the same day. It's easy to walk to from the Gothic District, so you can do the Cathedral, a Walking Tour of the Gothic Area and a visit to the Palace of Catalan Music all in the same day if you time it right.

Ordered online and it went very well...present voucher in advance or day of for tickets."

The over-the-top Modernista building is incredible to look at, the performance space is intimate and the prices are reasonable. You can reserve ahead online, which saves time spent in the ticket line. Just be sure to pick up tickets a couple of hours early; the will-call line gets long, too.The Opera y Flamenco show is a consistent favorite. You can eat inside or out at the Palau or at one of many good restaurants nearby."

In the weekends there might also be concerts in the morning (during the Autum to Srping season).

The tour groups are small and the guides are excellent with a clear passion for the work of the theatre. The tour starts with a history of the Palua with a video presentation which is very well done. It is followed by a tour of the main theatre which is small by modern standard, but has amazing achitectural feature culminating in the a center piece stain glass that needs to be seen to truly appreciate.Despite its age, it is clear that the Palau is a working theatre and most nights have shows. If you want to go to a show, you will need to book usually well in advance of the day of the event."

The latter was delightful and much cheaper but the main theatre has all the architectural gems including the breathtaking coloured glass 'chandelier' which graces the covers of so many guide books about Barcelona. If your budget can't stretch to a tour or a show, you can still go inside to look at the beautiful bar and perhaps stop for a glass of cava and a small tapas."

An offshoot of art nouveau, Catalan modernism was kick-started by the reawakening of the region's art & language during the late 19th century, following 200 years of suppression by their Spanish overlords. Perhaps the movement's most glorious, unshackled expression is Montaner's Palau de la Musica Catalana, a glittering confection of polychromatic glass & ceramic flora that could be Europe's most exuberant building.The tour of this venue was well worth it. When you go in there, it's like you forget there is a town outside. It has tours hourly in English from 10am to 3pm but the time slots for the different languages fill up fast so make reservations ahead of time. The group gets shown around the concert hall's auditorium, overseen by a celestial, kaleidoscopic skylight of such disconcerting beauty, it once caused opera singer Montserrat Caballe to forget her lines. With the flowers on the walls & the sun above, it's like waking up in the summer countryside. The nearest Metro is Urquinaona."

Designed by the most famous Catalan Architect of that period, Luis Domenech i Montaner for the choral group, Orfeo Catala, Palau de la Musica Catalana is unique & astonishing. Built between 1905-1908 at the height of the resurgence of Catalan nationalism, the Art Nouveau structure is full of symbolic ornamentation emphasizing Catalan character, choral music, modernism & futuristic. It was awarded in 1909 as the best building in Barcelona. The exterior is of red bricks and ornamental iron. Inside, the fabulous Palace of Catalan Music has maximum light & space with its stained glass panes & inverted dome skylight. The architect's love of nature is obviously seen & felt all over with the elaborate floral ornamentation & the symbolism of sun & sky in the design of the inverted dome skylight. The guided tour included a mini concert & it confirmed the perfect acoustics of the concert hall."

The tour itself was informative but the beauty of the palace was amazing enough on its own to warrant a visit from anyone traveling to Barcelona. You really have to see it(IN THE DAY TIME!!) to do it justice. I say in the day time because that's how it was designed to be seen. The architects/artists designed it specifically to use the natural sunlight coming in through the stained glass. I only wish that they still did more daytime performances to truly let people experience it the way it was meant to be experienced. Almost as unfortunate is the owner's decision to forbid any photography during the tour. This is just selfish in my opinion as it hurts tourists' abilities to save their memories in pictures. I almost gave it 4 stars because of this but that just wouldn't be fair. Actually I think it could be a less of a hidden gem and likely an even more popular site in Barcelona if people coming home could show their families and friends images of it's wonderful interior."

We went to the second floor after the show to see if recommendations for sitting up high were correct, but it didn't seem that we could see well from there. Be sure to get a front row in a box, maybe. We decided not to tour the building since we paid for the show, but we were able to walk around all the levels after.

As recommended by many TripAdvisor reviewers, we skipped the tour and went for the concert. I bought online the tickets to Flamenco and Opera performance. I enjoyed the Flamenco part but the opera part sucked for many reasons and I love opera. In the case of Palau de Musica type of establishment you would expect to have some standards but that performance was obviously targeted for tourists and so kitschy that it hurt. We have visited quite many concert halls in the world and that was one of the most disappointing experiences we have had. So before you book your tickets, make sure that the performance is worth it."

But wish we hadn't bought the cheapest seats (30euros!) as could see the musicians but only an occasional glimpse of the dancers due to them dancing out of our sight and people in front of us leaning forward so they could try and see but that made it worse for us. Will try for seats in the stalls next time. Very disappointed."

It's not a far walk from Pla\u00e7a Catalunya or the Cathedral and the streets behind it (watch your bags!) are typical of a neighborhood in Barcelona. Inside the place looks like a wedding cake with a magnificent staircase. If you can get in or better yet go to a concert there, you'll love he soppy busts of composers that adorn the theater itself. The music played there can be international quality (at international prices) or just simpler local artists. But it is more a delight to the eye than the ear."

The music palace is more than just a concert hall: it is a de facto temple to \"catalanismo\", the cultural pride movement of the Catalu\u00f1a region. This quickly becomes obvious to visitors after you obtain your ticket, and are mustered with other members of your tour group for a lecture and short video about the greatness of Catalan art and culture expressed in the building. These very controlled guided tours, costing \u20ac15 per adult, with photography not permitted, are the only means of general public access to the concert hall other than attending a performance. The lobby spaces and a cafeteria are open to the public.Most foreign visitors to Barcelona will be previously aware of Catalu\u00f1a's most famous architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed (1852-1926), but not of Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner (1850-1923), who designed the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana. However, Dom\u00e8nech also had an important role in Catalan modernism. This building is very important as an example of that style, with unusual attractive decorative elements and uses of materials, particularly of glass and tiles. It is also a good example of what not to do technically in a concert performance venue: the small highly decorated stage has limited room and prevents use of sets, and vast areas of glass make the hall impossible to black out during daylight performances while also creating acoustical problems.Despite the restrictions on photography and flaws of the building, it has a very interesting interior and exterior, and has been exceptionally well restored. Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana is not a must-see in Barcelona, but it is close. We highly recommend it."

The construction and the historical aspect of the venue are great. A disappointing part of the tour was that photos are not permitted - not that I think photos would do the venue justice, but, it would be nice to have a take away of the experience. The amount of color is great, especially with the amount of natural light that flows into the space. To see how Montaner succeeded in envisioning and creating such a beautiful space to enjoy music and to incorporate so many elements of nature is definitely worth a tour of the venue."

I did love the idea of the muses though, I thought that was great.Overall, i found it interesting and probably worth going to for a lot of people."

Acoustics were excellent, and the young performers were stylish and talented. What really knocked our socks off, though, was the building itself: colors, textures, and design were all rich and exciting. It was interesting to learn that Gaudi was by no means the only genius architect Barcelona spawned. Muntaner, who created the Catalan Music Palace, was another. We wouldn't have missed this place."

We were told by another guide, that if you are going to see a concert, the best are the flamengo, just for the accoustics alone, as some concerts are less than enthusiastic in their performances. During the off season, there was not a line to enter for the tour, but the 40 - 45 minute tour still required a 15 minute wait before hand. Our tour only had 30 people, at 12 Noon, and as it is deceptively intimate venue, I understand the limit of 50 people per tour.Do add this to your list of must sees of Barcelona.

I am not reviewing the place though but the tour that you must take in order to see it. As this is the only way to enjoy the Palau as a tourist (as well as a concert I guess, but we weren't interested in any of the scheduled ones) I think that the review should be about the tour too. Half of the visit is wasted on a slide show telling the story of the Palau instead of actually seeing it. The guide's English was not up to standard making her explanations quite uninteresting and difficult to understand. And finally we weren't allowed to explore some parts of the building like the very top floors, which looked quite amazing. Don't miss the building but maybe try first to find a concert that suits your taste."

More than Gaudi, it is a preeminent stage for aesthetic splendor. In the Eixample district, a 19th century urban planning experiment, stands its queen: Palau de la Musica Catalan.Striking, inside and out, its impact on the eyes is potent. Its terraces and staircases are richly endowed with glass-blown vibrant railings. Tall mosaic columns are crowned with ornate porcelain floral patterns. The glazed brick and stained glass facade of its interior courtyard is encased glass as if a museum showpiece. Table-studded with glowing floating lanterns strewn across its open air breadth, this is its most luminous and atmospheric vantage point under the moon. Majestic and bewitching, this monument to music so singularly Catalan is an architectural statement to the world not to be missed. Undoubtedly one of the shining examples of the Art Noveau (modernism) school. It is primarily a product of architect Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner. It is a UNESCO World Heritage sight. If you want to enter its famed concert hall, you will have to pay for a ticket for a how or make arrangements. Access to much of its interior is free."

Montaner's vision as an architect truly comes to an amazing fruition, from the stained glass to the ceramics to the stone and plaster. It is an indescribable place, so I will stop trying. Simply a must go must see location. I strongly recommend a concert. The acoustics of the hall are amazing, especially for the human voice, violins, and woodwinds.

We arrived half an hour early to have a drink in the bar and look around this wonderful concert hall/palace. So much beauty.

There are over 300 performances a year.The cost to get in for the tour is 15 euros or about $20 for a \"one hour\" tour. This is the only way to get inside. My tour started with a video which took up the first 15 minutes of the tour. After that, I had a tour of the building which lasted 30 minutes. So be aware that the tour may be shorter than expected. The highlight, of course, is the music hall and the \"sun\" light above. But every inch is covered with something to look at. It is an AMAZING building and I have no regrets spending the $20 to get to see this unique place. No photos. In the music hall, the tour guide \"played\" Bach's \"Tocatta and Fugue\" for two minutes on the organ by switching on the computer that records everything played on the organ. Pretty cool. Study the venue online before going as there is a question and answer session at the end of the tour. It would have been nice to have had some questions ready.I went for tickets 3 times. The first two times, the tickets were on sale at the gift shop and were sold out in English for the day. (I think this was on the weekend.) The third time I went the tickets were on sale at the ticket office next to the cafeteria (located around the corner from the front Palau entrance.) Tickets were available for the next tour. This was a Thursday, I believe. You can also buy tickets online but although there is an English version of the website, the ticket sales were in Catalan only.If you found my review helpful, click on \"yes.\" Thanks."

My aunt and uncle have been to Spain many times and it was only mine and my parents first time and she insisted that we see \"el Palau\" because she had seen it long ago and absolutely loved it. So we went and we fell in love too. I can't remember now how much was the tour but it wasn't expensive. We had time to eat from the bar. Some of us had tapas and others enjoyed an espresso or a nice coke from the original bottle (we don't see many of those in the US anymore). We took pictures and finally headed in. They start you off by playing a small clip on a projector for about 6 or 7 minutes with each of the different artists and singer explaining how their experiences have been as they have played at the \"Palau\". They finally move you into the main floor of the theatre and explain everything to you in detail and stopping to ask if you have any questions. My one and only problem is that this place has different tours all at the same time (like maybe three) and the theatre isn't all that big. Our guide was a small lady who was trying her best to speak loudly to be heard but many times I couldn't catch what she was saying because of the other groups and their chatter. The building is just as spectacular on the inside as it is on the outside. The architecture of the building inside is exquisite and the sun/tear drop ceiling is just amazing. They DO NOT let you take any pictures or record any videos whatsoever. They are strict with that. I managed to sneak out my iPhone while it was on silence and took some shots but they did not come out so well. This place is truly worth seeing. I recommend it."

Built at the turn of the 20th century for a choral society that still owns it (thus no photography allowed), it is an incredible building, with a rather ornate exterior, and a very Victorian theatre-type interior. The dominant feature is a huge stained glass skylight with a \"gumdrop\" feature hanging from it. The only way to see the interior is on a guided tour.

The tour starts with a short film sharing the thoughts of several performers who have been on stage. As part of tour, you explore the various levels and really have an opportunity of seeing it up close. I think that children would enjoy the tour with its floating sculptures. I wish that the tour was longer to more fully absorb the interior. There is a caf\u00e9 attached to the building where we had a cup of coffee and some chicken strips. If you only have time to tour just one \u201cmodernism\u201d building, this should be on your list.

However, we were informed that we could watch Vivaldi's Four Seasons and so we splurged on tickets (only 27 Euros each, but a splurge for us). Boy was it worth it. The building is definitely the most beautiful concert hall I have ever been in. While not overly large it is packed with detail (stained glass, mosaic, plaster statuary) and has excellent acoustics. This has been one of the highlights of our time in Barcelona.For tourists, the building is very centrally located just off of Via Laetania (close to Plaza Catalunya, La Rambla, Passeig de Gracia, etc). But, it can be hard to see from a distance as it is in a densely packed city. Comically, I overheard two people asking a passerby where it was, and they were standing about twenty feet away.

Inside and out ... what an incredible place!!I had booked months prior to arriving and enjoyed the Salsburg Orchestra and the Palau Choir which featured two fantastic sopranos. I also booked tickets to a Spanish Guitarist while in Barcelona and enjoyed that as well.I went early for each show so I could take in more and more of the amazing work inside this building... it is beyond words and you really need to experience it.Many were taking photos but I did hear them ask one girl not too...not sure why as everyone else was...but.. they may or may not tell you to put your camera away as they do post no photos inside. I think flash is the big issue.If you have purchased tickets online, you must go to the ticket office inside prior to the performance to get your admit ticket. I did see many people present thier print out at door and be sent back to office.For seating.. I was front and center for the guitarist... so was perfect for that... a bit close but good last minute seats are available. For the symphony I was upper level on the curve..and lucky to be front row up there.. if you are a few rows back..it is very hard to see the stage from either side. Any center seat is a good seat...no matter how far back or how high. The sound is very good. The only distraction from the performances was the brilliance of the facility itself. I am so happy I booked two shows here as again I noticed something different each time.Brilliant !!"

And to think that it was built in only 3 years after construction started. Today it would be impossible to reproduce it in such a short time because we no longer have those artists and craftsmen who could work on it. Lluis Domenech I Montaner, the architect, was really a very exceptional man to have planned all the details of the building and assign each artist and craftsman the work he had to do.There were so many things that impressed me. The stained glass windows are really beautiful. They allow very much light into the building. Then there are all the ceramic works and sculptures on the fa\u00e7ade and interior of the building. Every where you turn, you see something really beautiful. Who can forget the stained glass skylight? And what about the ceramic roses that adorn the ceiling?This building is really a decorative arts building that is completely unforgettable. I am completely hooked on it and have to see it every time I visit the city."

You'll love the exterior, but pay for the tour (book a day in advance) so you get to see inside, and if you can score a ticket to a concert (any concert), do it.

We stayed in Barcelona for a few days enroute to Italy last year and stumbled upon it while taking a bike tour, as it is rather tucked away from plain view. This modernist music hall is beyond belief!!! The tour is very informative and prompted us to attend a rock concert on our last day.... It was spectacular! The building hosts and encourages all forms of music!...seeing the concert was really an unforgetable night out!!! The splendor of the stained glass, the 2000 plus mosaics which adorn the ceiling, the busts of Bethoven and Bach, and all other symbolisms which adorn the interior of the Palau, and the most raved about acoustics all made for a spectacular night out. One would think ... A rock concert in this beautiful historical place of grandeur????... Well let me tell you Latin grammy winning La Oreja de Van Gogh rocked the house!!!!"

Our guide was great but unfortunately, there was a huge group with kids that were apparently \"special guests\" as they were taking pictures everywhere even though we were told no pictures allowed. They were quite distracting and I feel as though the staff should have done something to ensure that they were not a bother to us. We went recently and it was 24 euros for 2 admissions. I also think they should explain to us the meaning and history of the auditorium rather than make us watch a video. That was a bit of a drag and def not worth the money. I felt 24 euros was more than it was worth for a 50 minute tour that included a 15 minute video. Also, if you pay ahead you can pay by credit but if you are paying at the ticket stand, cash only."

The theatre is extremely well designed with the main stalls all raked so a good view could be had from anywhere and the acoustics were also very good. Everything is in good condition. The theatre is the most decorated part of the building and really added to the experience. I will definitely go back again and I would recommend seeing the building by attending a concert.

The exterior is stunning and the concert hall is even more breathtaking! We wanted to see the space on our honeymoon in Barcelona, but rather than just do the touristy thing and take the tour, we instead bought tickets to a concert that was occuring while we were in town. The space was built for the Choral Society, but there are a wide variety of musical performances on the calendar. I may have preferred to see a more classical music act, however the only show while we were in town was a Spanish rock guitarist, Rosendo.The show was on a Saturday night and was, in my opinion, quite similar to an American rock concert. There were the casual fans, the groupie-types, the hippies, etc. All in all, it made for a familiar, yet foreign experience. The interior of the concert hall was, as I mentioned, gorgeous. The rock & roll music, strobe lights, and dancing fans did seem a little out of place is such a beautiful facility. But overall I am glad we decided to see the Palau de la Musica this way, because the cost of the concert ticket was only a little more than the cost of a guided tour and we got a much greater cultural experience!A note about the ticket-buying process.... We purchased in advance online through the venue's website, which redirected me to a company called ServiCaixa (sort of like ticketmaster). I was able to buy the tickets from the US, but then got an email with instructions on picking them up from a ServiCaixa terminal in Barcelona. Of course, I didn't know what that meant at the time, but thought it couldn't be too complicated. As it turns out, ServiCaixa is also a bank and you will see their ATMs all over town; but not all of these ATM terminals can print out your pre-purchased tickets. We had luck going to the box office before the show, where I showed them the email print out and they were able to look up and give us our tickets. It wasn't a terribly difficult process, but I did get a little nervous when I couldn't find a ServiCaixa terminal that could dispense tickets. I would recommend just going to the Box Office to pick them up 1 hour before the show."

The architect was NOT Gaud\u00ed but Lluis Domen\u00e8c y Montaner, but it is not less spectacular than any of the Gaud\u00ed attractions. In the 1990 the building became world heritage and was enlarged by Oscar Tusquets.If you arrive early for your tour you can have a coffee at the bar near the meeting point.The tour starts with a film about the history of the building in the rehearsal room, which is very well made.

Our first night in town, we walked by the Palau around 8 pm and there was a big symphonic concert about to start. It was fun watching all the dressed-up locals rushing to get to the brightly lit concert hall (there were a few tourists mixed in, too, obvious by their too-casual clothing). We thought about getting stand-by tickets for the concert, but decided to pass since we were tired. We did mingle with the concert-goers in the ornate lobby for a bit, though. (We later got tickets to a 10 am English lang tour of the hall; note that you have to pay cash, no credit card. My jaw still drops over its unique decor\u2014when you're on the upper level, check out all the amazing details of glass and wood.)I'm writing this review to add my vote about taking the tour, but also to mention that once we decided not to go to the concert that night, we wandered out to the Via Laietana and were going to head back to the Hotel Constanza, since we'd already eaten. Then we walked by a tiny creperie and I felt the urge for chocolate and perhaps a coffee drink. Two other couples were in there drinking beer, but once they saw our crepes they ordered their own, too. These crepes were to die for! A huge variety of choices, and just plain HUGE! We never should have ordered two (one choc + strawberries, the other dark chocolate and vanilla ice cream), and the shared coffee-and-Kahlua was too much, but it was a great ending to our first night in town. If you want dessert, look for Creps Barcelona, near the Palau at 45 Via Laietana (we later saw many more creperies around town)."

I suppose if I were a fan of the symphony, I would have appreciated it more. The accoustics were as great as the design and the artwork in this gothic meets modernista design facility. Tickets to the show were not cheap and the place was about 50% capacity on a Friday night. We went to the nearby 4Cats for a preshow dinner and it made for a nice night out in Barcelona.

What I liked about this particular performance is that it combined famous arias with flamingo dancing, sometimes they shared the stage and most times they performed separately. This helped to keep the show more entertaining than a full opera or a full evening of just flamingo dancing. The venue is truly beautiful. My only regret was to see so many American and British tourists show up dressed down in cargo shorts and running shoes. The European tourists that attended dressed up fully, some in full length dresses. You can image the mix. I booked tickets on line in advance at approx. $75 each. When we picked up the tickets at the performance we were 8 rows from the stage centre. You can select less expensive ticket options as most of the seating offers an excellent view of the stage. I highly recommend attending any performance at the Palau Musica Catalana in Barcelona."

You watch a little film telling you the history of the place then you have a guided tour all through it. But the best part was they take you into the concert hall underneath the stain glass window while listening to a demonstration of the pipe organ. The only disappointing part was that they didn't let us out onto the balcony with all the cool columns. I don't know if it was because of the time of year or if they just don't let any one out there.

Then our very knowledgeable guide took us to the top level where we could get the best view & we were even able to listen to the organ which was a delight. The stained glass orb skylight was large, impressive, colorful & surrounded by 40 angels. The columns inside are covered with busts & horse sculptures.

It is a very short walk from the metro station (Urquinaona) or a 5-minute walk from the Cathedral area.We decided instead of taking a tour that we would see a performance, since there was a dance performance that was only 1 euro more than the tour. Buying a ticket for a performance gives you full access to the beautiful theatre. Enter as early as they let you (about 45 minutes before the performance begins) to wander the theatre before taking your seat.Every square inch of the building is decorated with beautiful mosaics, carvings, paintings, and other designs. It's hard to know where to look! But it's absolutely incredible, if a little too busy for my tastes.If you decide to see a performance, I recommend sitting somewhere in the lowest balcony level (I forgot what it is named), as close to the center as possible. You will have a more complete view of the stage than if you sit in the orchestra main level.Photography is not allowed anywhere in the theatre, but there are several small shops nearby selling postcards if you'd like a picture of the interior. Don't buy from the official gift shop; it is triple the price of the smaller shops."

If you are going to a show, you can see and hear well even in the back and the seating is not steep for those who fear heights. It is designed to be level and for comfort. There are some limited view seats but generally, even the least expensive will do."
