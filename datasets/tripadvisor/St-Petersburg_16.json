Crossing the Gulf of Finland on the majestic roads is an experience in itself, Kronshtadt is a small naval island about 55 kms from Saint Petersburg, and has a wonderful rustic vibe attached to it. The naval cathedral is definitely one of the best churches I have seen in my life. The architecture is splendid both from the inside and outside. After the church do go to the park and the coastline, and then take a walk across the island."

Leave St. Petersburg north and enjoy first the beautiful ride on the dam across the Gulf of Finland before entering Kotlin island. The Naval Cathedral is located in the south and can be easily accessed. Free parking possible along the streets around the church. The cathedral is beautiful from in and outside and pictures can be taken (most probably not during ceremonies). Leave the island in southern direction (Tallinn) and be cautious not to miss the exit to Lomonossow (Oranienbaum)/Peterhof. Easily to do this trip in 1 day, having seen the outskirts of St. Petersburg as well."

This may not rank on the same level as St. Isaac's cathedral or the Church of the Savior on Spilled blood in terms of size or opulence, but it is a living church that you will want to see.We were able to visit this Cathedral on a Sunday morning and attended a portion of a service. Whether or not you can do so, this is a living church so there are a number of considerations. First, of course, this is a house of worship so you should respect those coming here for that purpose. There is also no photography, and there is a dress code of sorts including the requirement common to Russian Orthodox churches that women wear scarves over their heads.Although you cannot take photos of the interior, they are certainly memorable, with many artistic details, icons, and elaborate trim.This is a lovely cathedral and very much worth a visit if you are in St. Petersburg."

Being on the Kotlin Island in Kronstadt municipality, we visited beside the Kronstadt fortress, the Naval Cathedral of Saint Nicholas as well.This Russian Orthodox cathedral was built in 1903 - 1913 and represents the main church of Russian Navy. It is consecrated to the fallen seamen. In some period of time, the cathedral was converted in the cinema, the House of Officers and the museum of the Navy.The design was done in the Neo - Byzantine architectural style.The cathedral is very beautiful outside and inside as well.There are many stunning icons in the cathedral and main altar is raised on a 4 meter high platform. The main dome is quite impressive with the golden crown set along the perimeter and the golden cross on the top. Below, there are two bell towers with the smaller domes on each of them. Not to miss when in Kronstadt !"

For example, it became a cinema in 1932, right after it was defaced (crosses and bells taken down) and valuables nationalized for the Soviet treasury. As a result much of the glory of the church were lost or destroyed. However, it was fully renovated in the last few years based on the existing photographs, and since Kronshtadt is now an open city, public may enjoy its beauty. It is an impressive Eastern Orthodox Cathedral unusual in the use of many subtle nautical symbols. It is free to enter, but they ask that you keep your shoulders and knees covered, in fact they provide scarfs and surrongs at the entrance. If you are in the area, you must take a moment to visit it."

It has a complicated history, because of the war (it was converted to a movie theatre; the stone slabs honouring fallen sailors were torn out of the walls and used as benches in the washrooms; the bell is in situ simply because it was too large to be destroyed. Details such as these make you curious about the history of the place and the people).The church was reconsecrated as recently as 2013, on the centennial of its construction. Beautiful. The Russian Orthodox Cathedral can handle 5000 worshippers. As a family we thought this was quite the highlight of the trip. "

Because if you decide to go in you probably would be disappointed. YES, it looks nice. But NO, it looks so cheap and mainstream. The floors are covered with primitively designed pictures somehow associated with the sea and water(e.g. Fish, seagulls) and just random figures. Parts of the walls that start a little over your head are painted cheap and look mostly like a wallpaper. Windows are made of painted glass pieces, not even a mosaics.

I have a bone to pick with Trip Advisor on this one as Kronstadt doesn't really even count as St. Petersburg and if you go to the city, especially for a weekend, your time is far better spent in other locations than taking time out to go here and see the Naval Cathedral. It's a pretty sight, sure, but would max spend one hour here and only when I've seen about 10 other things ahead of it."

It's beautiful, grand, very light and the central part inside reminds the front part of a ship. Besides, the cathedral is maybe one the few places which successfully combine a museum and religious traditions. Everything looks so natural, even exhibits seem to be part of the inside architechture and don't ruin the inspiring and respectful atmosphere inside.It' a real treasure, don't miss the opportunity to visit it."

As this Cathedral is still an active place of worship, be aware that those deemed to be wearing inappropriate clothing (shorts/mini-skirts, sleeveless T-shirts etc.) will be stopped from entering.In addition, it's important to know that visitors are expected to remain hushed as many tourists/locals are praying. It's possible to 'light a candle' in this beautiful sacred place (charged for in local currency) to honour the memory of loved one's who have passed. If looking for a place of serenity - for a short period of contemplation/medication, I cannot think of a better place to recommend in St Petersburg."

Due to this, you can't actually see much of the building, but the part you can is really peaceful and beautiful, gives you an idea of what the daily use of a cathedral in Russia is rather than commercialized ones. Definitely recommend if in the area!"

This is one of the examples that Russian restoration processes could reach best results! this is really impressive cathedral and if you have some 6-7 days for St.-Petersburg it is worth to schedule a trip to Kronstadt. My advise it to calculate at least one hour to spend for this cathedral because there are a lot of small and interesting details and I am sure you would need some time to get the impression.

We visited during the 10 am service and a small choir of clear voices responded to the priest's invocations. Candles and candelabras flickered before the icons, seemingly animating them. Worshippers stood for the service while we silently observed from the back. A very worthwhile experience."

I very highly recommend investigating Kronshtadt, and I say so particularly as a foreigner, since the impression I have is that Kotlin island is very much overlooked by visitors. The peace of the town, its sea bay fronts, and the incredible cathedral, all with the fresh clean coastal winds, are like medicine for the muddy-headedness that might set in after a few too many days underneath Petersburg's magnificent but aggressive architecture.The peace of the cathedral is enhanced by the beautiful old drained gorge running by, which is uplifting in contrast to the flatness of the inner city, and the canal grid with the dilapidated brick complexes by the banks made a beautiful walking route, even feeling (to a Brit) eerily familiar. Kronshtadt garrison is a small place of great but often overlooked historical importance politically and militarily, and the naval cathedral is a perfect milestone to aim for on a visit, particularly when you can catch sight of the golden domes over the old naval installations as you get closer.Not least, the journey itself to Kronshtadt is absolutely worth making for its own sake, the stretch from Lakhta to Lisiy Nos especially, and the dacha areas and high rise outskirts of the city. True Russian sights, and - it cannot be stressed enough - totally easy and unbelievably cheap. 28r to Staraya Deryevnya metro, then 25r on the 101 bus from the bus park just to the north (slightly west) of the station, by the tram rails and Mebel city or whatever the furniture warehouse is called. The bus over to Kotlin is a busy one, but it is no hassle. There are useful toilets at Staraya Deryevnya in the Gulliver centre, and then on the ground floor at the rear of the commercial centre on Grazhdanskaya street where the 101 arrives (although that one will cost 20r).Kronshtadt was a highlight of my visit to Petersburg. I wish its residents well."
