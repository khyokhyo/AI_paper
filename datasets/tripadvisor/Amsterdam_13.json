It's called the Gentleman's Canal and was once considered as the most important canal in the city. It's where the wealthier merchants lived. It also happens to be one of the most interesting canals to walk along. It has Amsterdam's oldest house on it (No.81) 364-370 you find the four Cromhout houses. And further down are the Seven bridges of Reguliersgracht. One of the most photographed sights in the city and very beautiful. We enjoyed a morning stroll to De Herengracht cafe (435) for in our opinion one of the best breakfasts in Amsterdam. Coming back in September of this year, we noticed a few shops and cafe's had gone or changed but it's still one of the best looking canals in the city as far as we are concerned. And definitely worth a stroll down."

This 45 room home was originally built in 1665 for Paulus Godin, slave trader and director of the Dutch West India Company. Later, in 1926, the house became mayor's residence. The mayor lives on the third and fourth floors. The merchant's house on 497 was built in 1664. In 2004, the house was the main location for the Amsterdam sequence of the movie 'Ocean's Twelve' with with George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Andy Garc\u00eda, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac.

It was one of my most enjoyable experiences sitting with my legs dangling above the water surrounded in the most beautiful flowers and people :) A lovely feel for how Amsterdam was in the early 1900's. Alot of architecture fully intact and well maintained. Streets kept very well with a nice local ambience about it. Can't wait to do it all over again <3"

It is also the one that crosses the posh areas of downtown with the nicest and most expensive houses alongside it. Again, if you carry a stroller make sure you look ahead before you chose which sidewalk you walk in because not all of them are good for strollers and can be a challenge. This area is quiet and nice and charming. Make sure you also see the canal in a boat cruise, it changes the perspective of it."

I read somewhere that Herengracht is considered as the most important canal in Amsterdam. The reason being, many important businessmen and mayors of the city had lived here in the 17th century. On a Christmas day, I felt so bored and decided to get out of my cozy nest. It was a cold day but I guess Amsterdam never ceases to surprise me. What fascinated me most is the houses/ buildings at the canal. Depending on the shape or design of the gable, you can predict the year when the house/ building was built. I learned something new again that day. Some of the buildings have interesting stories. For example, the House of Bartolotti on Herengracht 168-170. The name does not sound Dutch at all. It's Italian. Well, the house was an inheritance from a successful merchant of Bologna for his Dutch nephew (who later adopted his uncle's family name).Or take the house on Herengracht 81. The physical appearance isn't as \"stylish\" as the Bartolotti house. But there is a story for that too. The house is the oldest building where people used to live in (Dutch: woonhuis). It was built in 1590. It was used by a merchant family. The lower floor was used as dwelling area. The upper floor functioned as a warehouse. These two houses are just a couple of examples of the many interesting canal houses in Herengracht.There were many bars/ cafes around the canal. So, don't worry if you feel tired or hungry from all the walking. If you take a walk in winter time (as I did), bear in mind that the day is quite short. That day the sun set at around 4 pm. There was no sun during the whole day."

While we were there, an unusual Christmas light show was installed over one section of the canal, which was unique in the installation (across the canal). We could not figure out how it was installed or the (power) source of the illumination (decided it must be chemical), but it was awesome and indicative of 'free treats' along the canal.You can visit the Bag and Purse Museum there, (we did not go), but the best Museum is the Canal House Museum, which we highly recommend."

Had the set meal of 3 courses and have to say that it was the most delicious meal I have ever had and they even happily obliged to take off the beetroot as I have a phobia of the stuff and they didn't batter an eye lid. Chef came out and talked us through the meal, a starter of noodles, white bait and cray fish, followed by the most succulent dish of lamb chops, lamb stew and seasonal vegetables and then the most decedent white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake, the lightest chocolate moose and raspberry sorbet that had me wanting to scrap the plate clean.

Rich merchants built their city palaces there. And can still enjoy the sight of then. Take a tour on one of the round about boats, eliminate the cars from your mind and look at the richest architecture Amsterdam ever produced. Remember that the upper floors were only used for store. People lived on the lower floors where the windows and ceilings are extremely high to catch as much light as it possible in wintertimes. During the summer months people moved to theirlarge summerhouses in the country side, away from the buzz of the city and the stench of the canals. The buzz is still there, but the stench has gone since the construction of the sewerage system in the 19th and early 20th century."

Like the spokes of a wheel another set of canals radiate from the centre making a spiders web. Each canal (gracht) has a road along either bank. The only hazard is from cyclists. The motorists are very careful of pedestrians. This cannot be said of Dutch cyclists. they are generally rather self centred and arrogant. they don't make any allowance for pedestrians who are forced to walk in the road as the pedestrian paths are blocked with parked cycles. They ride straight at you and don't slow down at all. Herengract is one of the circular canals that we walked along side many times on our travels to town centre and the various attractions we visited."

While a lot of the patrons were there just for drinks, we had just arrived on an early morning flight from the US, so we wanted an early dinner.

Near to the top of Herengracht, toward Central Station, lies a very sweet side street 'Herenstraat'. Here you will you find a scattering of independent quality shops offering everything from Asian Art, leather goods, clothes but above all, no less than FOUR superb little restaurants. They say 'healthy competition' is a good thing, hence this maintains the high standards offered by these very different establishments. Short menus are also a good sign of freshness and quality, large menus often mean some elements are prepared long in advance or even frozen to avoid waste. There is SO little to distinguish between these four, however, I will try my best!! MAX RESTAURANT, don't be fooled by the slightly stark minimalist interior, especially during the day. At night, this place 'glows' and once full, becomes very cosy. Service is impeccable, professional and 'not in your face'. The food is exciting with an Indonesian twist. For example, I had the amazing lamb fillet with a wonderful sauce infused with a gentle spice and coconut, not obvious but just enough to excite! The menu is fairly short but there will be something for everyone and priced for either a two or three course meal, depending how much you want to spend or how hungry you are. Check this out online. MAX is HIGHLY recommended, great for a romantic meal for two or a party of eight or more!! SEASONS RESTAURANT - WOW!!! We hit this place the night before it closed for just a few days for a new paint job, hence there were some items off the menu. Despite this, the service, food and ambience were outstanding!! I can't comment on the decor as I haven't seen the refurbishment but it's a very cosy place. Again the menu is fairly short but exciting and full of amazing tastes and textures. I had the 'Upside Down' Beef Wellington, a deconstruction of this classic dish with prime beef served ON TOP of a light puff pastry crust infused with a whiskey/mushroom sauce, incredible!! Google the new menu online as there will again be various price options depending on the number of courses. This place ranks JOINT NUMBER 1 with MAX, I simply can't separate them. TASTE OF VIETNAM - WOW!! This has to rank as one of Amsterdam's BEST Vietnamese restaurants, a hidden gem!! Service, menu and decor/ambiance makes this a total must. Too much to say here but check out online and add to your list!! Finally CHEZ GEORGE - You will love the white table cloths, impeccable attentive service, presentation and menu. This is fine dining but not at fine dining prices. There was a fixed menu on offer the night we visited offering a good choice of meat and fish dishes in typical French style. This is the perfect place for a very quiet and intimate dining experience, very romantic. The Chef and owner takes a very front of house approach and will take great pride in serving and talking you through the various dishes. Highly recommended. IN SUMMARY, this little side street has a LOT to offer with plenty of choice in a small area and will save you trekking up and down the canals to find something special. PLEASE RATE if you found any of this helpful on your visit."

Herengracht is full of old world Amsterdam charm - and also happens to be the location of my favourite hotel!"

Allow a full hour to go through the rooms. A new section has been added which will allow visitors to follow four children through the period. While interesting for adults, this area allows children to listen to stories told by the four children and enter into rooms designed to show how families lived during the period. This museum is well done and I would recommend for anyone interested in that period of history."

Very dangerous traffic conditions for newly-arrived tourists: bicycles and trams sneaking up on you from all directions, cyclists not always stopping for red traffic lights, some drivers stopping to let you cross - but then a bike comes tearing down the road. Little patience from other pedestrians if you forget to walk on the right-hand side of often narrow sidewalks. In terms of road surface the bikes are best off, followed by the cars. You have to look where you are going not to trip over cobblestones and manhole covers. In parts the sidewalk is taken up by parked service vehicles and thousands of locked-down bicycles. But we survived and learnt a lot. Also: when trying to find your way back to your hotel, remember that Amstel (Street) is not the same as Amsteldijk."

No warehouses were allowed to be built and the frontages appear much larger than the warehouses in other canals. One of the bends in the canal is meant to be called \"the golden corner\" as that is where the wealthiest residents lived.At one end of the canal is the Amstel River. At this junction is the Hermitage Museum and the \"Skinny Bridge\".I visited 3 museums along the Herengracht. All of which are based in stately town houses. They were :- Cat Cabinet : object d'arte of a cat nature- The handbag and purse museum, it was literally that, four floors of handbags etc. Very interesting, and a lovely caf\u00e9.- Museum Willet-Holthuysen, this is a mainly period furnished merchants town house.Worth the walk, but all of the canal cruises travel along this route"

The Prinsengracht, Herengracht and Keizersgracht are 3 of Amsterdam\u2019s most famous streets located on canals within the city center. These 3 streets and canals are south of Central Station (train depot) and Dam Square. They radiate south and outward from Dam Square in a curved or convex pattern, akin to the 5 lower sides of an octagon. Large sections of all 3 are walkable in a morning or afternoon. The ambiance of the canals, the architecture, the bicycles, the people and the shops, bars and cafes are what Amsterdam is all about. They are the contemporary live museums of Amsterdam. If you are interested in how and when these canals and houses were built, and good stories about some of the people you know that lived in these houses, along with the history and culture of Amsterdam and its place in the world, then read Russell Shorto\u2019s Amsterdam, a wonderful and inspiring book, that will also inform you about the roots of individual freedom and the great advances of the Enlightenment."

One cannot go inside many of the listed historic buildings along Herengracht (eg., oldest house and Bartolotti house) and therefore these can only be appreciated from the outside for their architecture. As such, a boat cruise would suffice for this endeavour, although strolling along the canals is equally enjoyable with comfortable stops to be had in cafes or benches."

The Herengracht (Patricians' Canal or Gentlemen's Canal) is the second major ring canals, the first of the three major canals dug around the city centre in the 17th century. The other two are the Prinsengracht (Prince's Canal) and Keizersgracht (Emperor's canal). The canal is named after the heren regenders who governed the city in the 16th and 17th century. The most fashionable part is called the Golden Bend, with many double wide mansions, inner gardens and coach houses on Keizersgracht. If you travel around Amsterdam very much, it is hard to avoid encountering this large canal. It is a bit hard to tell one canal from the other, having a map and giving it a look before traveling the city is probably a good idea. This canal can be seen by various means, one of the canal boat tours may be the easiest."

Strolling along the canals next to the beautiful houses is like walking in another world. Rather than just walking over the bridges to the next canal, make sure you take time to walk alongside the canals and take in the beautiful scenery and quirky buildings."

Boat tour was the best orientation to learn about Amsterdam and I enjoyed this more than the one in Venice.It was very relaxed on the boat watching the beautiful houses dating back to the 16th-17th centuries, the lined old trees, the historical landmarks, the carillon churches, the charming bridges, the busy city cyclists, markets\u2026The lord\u2019s canal (Herengracht), the first of the three major canals in the city was one of the most popular spot and it was quite scenic to pass the so called \u201cGolden Bend\u201d, where the elegant Dutch mansions of the wealthy people were located."

If you want to enjoy this great canal, stroll along it, stand on its bridges and just keep looking. I like to cross back and forth; there are always details on the buildings that catch your eye from a new angle, and every view from the bridges is worth pausing for."
