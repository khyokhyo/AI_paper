Be ready to hop off quickly as it comes into the pontoon. We travelled with a stroller and we managed to squeeze up. I think there is a maximum number of passengers allowed, as I saw some asked to hop off, so it is safe."

We had just visited the Sheikh Saeed Al-Maktoum House, and walked the short distance from there to Dubai Creek. I enjoyed this walk much more than the Sheikh's house. You have a great view of the buildings on the other side of the shore and it is a quiet walk. There is no automobile traffic, just other people walking, and at the time we were there, very few of them. This was a great end to a hectic day of touring."

We enjoyed the old historical context of the creek and the fact it is a working port with the fancy yachts and workings vessel together,is also unbelievably clean. A river cruise is a must as is a trip on a water taxi. The food at the creek side restaurants is not to be missed as it is very high quality and very cheap compared to the rest of Dubai. The only downside we experienced was when we went to the old market and were so badly hassled that it put us off going to the other markets which was a shame. We bought a week long tour bus and inclusive attraction tickets that were well worth the money to make getting about nice and easy so we went a couple of times and along with the metro had no problems getting about as the roads are too congested to make taxis worth the while or price,"

As Dubai wealth started with merchant trading in and out of Dubai the Creek was the original core of the city.It is a unique experience to appreciate how real and simple life was before the expansion.There are several boat restaurants where you can enjoy a nice dinner. Around the Creek there is what is left of the tower built to protect the city from invaders with a great museum. Several souks are spread on both side of the river.i would recommend a nice walk around there, eat some original Arabic food and learn about the history of this place. A must is a ride from Dubai to Deira with one of their local boat. A great experience for just 1\u00a3"

On the other side, shopping area begins with road side shops. First you will pass tones of shops that sells many variety of spices. It is surprised to see how many variety's are sold... The spice smell in the street is just so nice and soothing for the hot sunny days.... Pass the spice market to get to the Gold Souk wherein you can see huge ornaments made of gold and diamonds. The Gold price is displayed on the street itself at many spots. Most of the Gold items are priced piece rate. If they go by weight then they do add making charges. So I won't say gold is cheap here but it is a different experience watching shop full of gold ornaments. One annoying part is, there are many vendor agents trying to grab you to their shops that sells duplicate handbags, goggles, perfumes of branded items. But still this is one good place to visit at least once when you are in Dubai...."

You can do an enclosed A/c boat, but you really want to try a traditional Abra. The creek is a port for goods from Iraq and other places, namely Iran, but the UN is pressuring the UAE to crack down on trade with Iran so my guess is that this will be turned into a tourist and yacht area eventually. See it while it is still here, the old wooden cargo ships are amazing and it is fun to wander the streets and bargain for saffron and textiles afterwards."

We didn't receive a warm welcome like others did but that's probably because the cruise team were grabbing ppl of the street to get on board. The cruise includes entertainment and buffet style meal. Indian curries, veg options and a range of starters made it worth while. It's a slow cruise from end of the marina to the other and back again. Sit on the top deck, although it's humid and no air con upstairs the view is amazing in the evening. Entertainment was supposed to be a magic show but not quite wat we got. Get your mehndi done on board for 20dh. We set of at 8.30pm back by 10.30pm."

The new/old Heritage area is fun to walk around, if a bit 'manufactured', then there's the old souk area in Bur Dubai with an interesting mix of tourist tat and old trading companies, including the bizarrely named 'Semtex Trading'. On this side of the creek you can walk down the length of the old souq, then continue alongside the creek past the Rulers Court with its helipads, to the area called Bastakiya or Al Fahidi. This is really the only true 'old' area left in Dubai, with a few restaurants, coffee shops, art galleries and narrow streets. The Dubai Museum is not far from here. The area beyond Bastakia on Al Seef road is being modernised/beautified (in the name of tourism) and will be a bit like the Madinat in Jumeirah. I liked it like it was with grass areas and room to walk. The Abras (water taxis) that cross the creek are incredibly cheap and easy to use, somebody will always point you in the right direction. You can also privately hire an abra for a longer trip along the creek, cruise past the tall Bank building with it's mirrored frontage and take a photo of your abra's reflection.The creek still has Dhow traffic on the Deira side but it is all scheduled to be moved to by the Deira Palm, which I think will be sad as the creek has been home to trading dhows for hundreds of years. On a good day, late in the afternoon looking down the creek from the Bur Dubai side Baniyas/Old Souk abra stop, if you wear the right rose-coloured spectacles, you can almost imagine you were in Venice, well I can and I love Venice even more than here. Finally Festival City, beyond the Business Bay Bridge is being enlarged and will soon have an even better selection of restaurants and shops, but if you want a 'real' drink here then go to the Belgian Beer Bar in the Crowne Plaza."

Walk a bit further along and you'll be in the heart of the market traders and shopping where bartering takes pride of place. Try the trip across the river in a dhow or small boat. This is a short trip for about 15 minutes and only costs 1 dhiram per person. There are no life vests or any real safety features so be careful with small children. I doubt if they have any insurance either. Still it's worth the experience. You can always get a taxi back to where you need to be.

You can also see the beautiful wooden dhow boats, upon which you can take an evening dinner cruise along the creek. Don't expect air conditioning in the old souks! Just soak up the atmosphere! I didn't see any toilets but there are free toilets in the museums, heritage buildings and the Al Ghubaiba bus station on the Bur Dubai side of the creek."

It is very basic in general however the pleasant feel of the ride is something for which 1 dirham is much worth for. We went to Spice and Gold Souk thereafter and then returned back to the place of embarkment.

Fishing and pearling industries relied on Dubai creek in 19th and 20th century. However, after Japanese invented the art of cultured pearls in the 1930s the pearling industry in Dubai died. Fishing to some extent still goes on. Dubai Creek is just over 10 km in length but there are plans to extend this. As the original creek had deep and shallow parts, which meant only certain ships could enter or anchor in the creek, dredging was carried out 50-60 years ago to allow much more continuous traffic of good. This trade lead to the development of Dubai. The Creek is lined with a large number of modern buildings of a variety of material and design. The wooden boat trip with a commentary goes a long way to explain the value of the creek as well as describing the various buildings. Worth spending an hour or so especially in the afternoon."

We can take the Creek cruise from here and it's an hourly cruise from 10.30am to 5.30pm.Lots of quaint shops and stalls to shop souvenirs and pashminas or ladies' apparels.The gold souk is just before it and plenty of jewellery shops there to browse too. It's one of the oldest souk district here.It was quite a sight seeing labourers loading and unloading heavy goods and I felt a bit sad at this visage Best way to tour around here is by taking the Big Bus Tour on the red line of city tour which starts from Wafi mall and lasts for two hours. Definitely worth it and one can get a 24 or 48 hours Big Bus Tour tickets."

I stayed at Jumeriah Beach which is definitely my favourite end of town but at Dubai Creek you have easy access to the Spice Souk and Gold Souk which is a definite must visit to Dubai. Australians you can buy the spice and bring back into Australia so long as you declare it at customs. They have some amazing spices and cheap. Do cross the Dubai Creek just jump on one of boats for 1 Dirham to cross the creek. Some great cafes and restaurants down here as well. You can also catch the Dubai Ferry back to the Dubai Marina. Will def visit this place again"

I suggest going for the boat tour, you will learn soooo much and see how they still use ancient techniques in their import of products. Also, take a driver down the street, you'll find the gold souk and experience true UAD culture."

You can see working boats and also in this area you can find the souks where you can be accosted by annoying people trying to sell you crap."

And so, we got to abra, a mode of transportation through the river, and the cheapest. There is an improvement, but the government sees to it to maintain the essence of old Dubai. There are restaurants also where you can enjoy the views while eating or just taking a drinks. Just prepare yourself for a lot of walking or if you want you can just sit on the benches there. You should try to drop by at the Sheikh Saeed Al-Maktoum House. They have the collections of the old Dubai. And by the way, if you don't want to take the abra(boat), you can take the Metro, depends where you feel convenient. It was very nice for a culture loving person. My review title says it all. It was worth the adventure."

The daily grind of people using the water taxis to go about their lives. Fishermen and families trying their hand at catching something for the table. A large section where photography is prohibited as the family of the ruling Sheik live there.Where the Country Club set and the sailors rub shoulders - so much to see and experience.We puttered for a few hours and had the wonderful experience of the sun setting as we cruised along the water - our driver filling us in on what we saw.

After getting to the boat we realised why, but this did not happen until we had spent an hour and a half riding around Dubai in a minivan. The Dhow was appealing but very basic once on board. We had to share a table with another couple, and the buffet dinner was pretty basic, although the food was good and would not complain. The entertainment was bizarre and just absurd, but it made us laugh, and before we knew it we were back, after sailing up and down the creek a couple of times. The whole experience was quite cheese but good value for money. The ride back to the hotel was much quicker after reading we insisted we were dropped off first. "

Simple, wooden boats ferry passengers over the creek between the two sides Bur Dubai and Deira. This short trip alone is worth going there.On the eastern side, you will find a whole collection of so-called \"Gold Souqs\", essentially extensive markets for jewelry, trinkets, memorabilia and also loads of more-or-less hidden fake brand selling lounges for watches, handbags etc. mostly located in side alleys.The docks are filled with wooden Dhows and other rather \"low-tech\" transport vessels, representing a somewhat more organic and less glistening Dubai experience. Really something to see...There is also am amphibian bus, crossing the creek as a passenger service - also an experience in itself.If you are in Dubai - do visit and get to see a different side of the Emirate!"

We took the Dow to visit the Museum and then ate by the water before coming back along the water to the hotel. We also visited the gold and spice souk the same way. Much better than getting in a taxi! The breeze was beautiful and seeing the skyline from the water very authentic. Cost was cheap, there are people on hand to guide you to the right stops and it was safe. Very happy to spend the time on a boat watching them all pass by.

The perfect counterbalance to the glitz and glamour of modern Dubai, It' somewhere you can still feel the history of the place, and appreciate its trading origins. A dirham will take you on a five /ten minute abra journey - a gem of an experience - travelling along the Creek in an old traditional boat, taking in the views alongside. Very peaceful. You can still see the traditional dhows loading up with everything from cars to washing machines to sunflower oil - heading off to war zones the world over. Anywhere else in the world, the goods would be stolen, but here they remain on the quayside, alongside the working boats with the crew who live on them... Lots of lovely walks, souqs and restaurants to explore - clothes, spices and household goods all readily available and if you head beyond the tourist hangouts, a little further back you can get some mega bargains in the backstreets. Enjoy it while it remains rustic - lots of development taking place on the British Embassy side - building restaurants which will no doubt be lovely, but can't compete with the natural assets of the Creek."

The Creek and the surrounding \"Old City\" gives one an excellent opportunity for photography buffs to capture some memorable images. In the old days before oil, the Creek served as a major trading place in the region. Dhows and ships from all over the region brought in goods for trade. To this day you can see them still doing business along the Creek.The opposite sides of the Creek are named \"Bur Dubai\" and \"Deira Dubai\". For the exchange of a few coins you can take an \"Abraa\" boat ride from one side to the other. Do this early morning or after sunset so that you can enjoy the beauty of the magnificent city. You can also book a romantic dinner on one of the many Dhows which are available along the Creek.On the Bur Dubai side you will find the \"Old Souk\" which is in itself a fantastic experience. If you walk along the many allyways you will find the traders doing business, spice shops and other exciting stuff."

Lots to see through the spice souqs, gold souqs and watching the old working dowhs. It's a fascinating place where you can easily wander away from the tourist feel and end up seeing smelling and hearing old dubai. Had a superb Indian lunch which was tucked in a back alley. Don't be afraid to venture off the beaten track for the most part it's interesting and people friendly."

The creek is crystal blue and it is interesting to watch the different type of boats loaded up with cargo headed out for all areas of the middle east. There are also passenger ferries which cost 1 Duram (same cost as museum entrence). You can take a passenger ferry called a atouck (sp?), old wooden boat, all the locals take it to go back and forth.

Went to the Souk but quickly left because of the awful hassle.Tried a boat trip along the Creek which was advertised as being for an hour but lasted 50 mins. including a refuelling stop. Only two of us on the boat but no proper seats and had to sit on either side of centre to maintain balance I believe. It travelled at a very slow speed and didn't go very far before it was forced by a barrier to turn back and retrace the same route. Operator didn't say a word throughout-not that there seemed to be anything of particular interest to see. In fact on one bank there was almost nothing other than the wall of a building displaying large 'NO PHOTGRAPHY' notices followed by a building site. The cost was a wasted 120 AED. In retrospect we should have just paid the small amount to cross the Creek a few times by boat as it looked much more interesting.Decided next to take a pleasant walk alongside the Creek and visited what I think was called the 'Heritage centre' or similar. It was free and had nice toilets and that's it because the rest of it was a dilapidated eyesore."

Some sources say that the creek extended as far inland as Al Ain, and that the Ancient Greeks called it River Zara. Historically, the creek divided the city into two main sections \u2013 Deira and Bur Dubai. It was along the Bur Dubai creek area that members of the Bani Yas tribe first settled in the 19th century, establishing the Al Maktoum dynasty in the city. In the early 20th century, the creek, though incapable then of supporting large scale transportation, served as a minor port for dhows coming as far away as India or East Africa. Although it impeded the entry of ships due to current flow, the creek remained an important element in establishing the commercial position of Dubai, being the only port or harbour in the city. Dubai's pearling industry, which formed the main sector of the city's economy, was based primarily on expeditions in the creek, prior to the invention of cultured pearls in the 1930s."

I wandered around the streets and found myself on Baniyas Road along the bank of the Creek. Wandering along it I found that the Dhows are still loaded in much the same way they've been loaded for generations - there's a ladder between the gunwale of the Dhow and the quay and men run up it with packages on their shoulders. It seemd a friendly area and fascinating to wander along."

Before the large Ports were built the creek served as the wharfs for the maritime trade for movement of goods by the Dhows.The creek waters enter the land at Al Ras and winds its way up to Bur Khalifa passing through Al Jedaf. The Abra ride was the quickest way for me to reach The Customs House at Port Rashid from my workplace at Deira."

He dropped us at the Fish Market and we wandered throw there, then the fruit and veg market and the Gold Souk. There was lots going on and people approached us but took no for an answer , so we did not feel hassled. Then we crossed the road to look at the dhows unloading their wares and took a ride across the Creek on a show. After a visit to the home Sheikh Makhtoum grew up in we wandered again, visiting a more touristy market selling souvenirs where the vendors were much more pushy."

Common is simply crossing on a mad bus/taxi for a mere 1 dirham. Organised boat trip - which I'm sure is lovely or ask for the Hour Tour at 120 dirham for two.The journey takes you down one side of the creek and back up. Do it!

Apart from taking a leisurely walk with friends or family along the creek (recommended during winter months only), you can take the river/creek taxi to see Dubai from the water. It cost 1 Dirham from one stop to another. Do this during the winter days but also at night as then you can enjoy the beauty of the many lighted buildings (Bastakia Quarter for example) and the lighted fairy-like Dhows (Wooden boats). Also this is a good way to hop-on and hop-off at each stop/station and visit the Gold Souk, bazaars, Dubai Museum, Fort, street food stalls, traditional trading dhows and historical buildings that are along the Dubai Creek. Another transport option on the creek is the waterbus. You also have the option of chartering small (read tiny) private wooden boats called \u2018Abra\u201d and they will take you from one end of the Dubai Creek to the other end. The private operators will usually approach you from their boats as you walk along-side the creek. It should cost about 120 Dirham. Remember to very clearly agree on a price before you get on the boat. On the boat ride, consider photographing your reflection on the glass windows of Emirates NBD building (one of the most interesting buildings for a bank in Dubai). It seems to be the must do for tourist. Allocate about an hour or more for the boat ride. Careful when taking photographs at certain stretches of the creek (Some have sign-boards to alert you) as photography of some private-homes and Embassy Buildings (by law) is not allowed.Another more \u2018expensive\u2019 option to enjoy Dubai Creek is booking onto one of the Dhow Cruises. It takes more than an hour to enjoy the cruise. Comes with dinner and some dhows have traditional belly dancers on it for entertainment. Price varies according to what is offered.Dubai Creek is also a good place to watch the annual New Year eve fireworks display. Just make sure you take the Dubai Metro to get there on \u2018fireworks\u2019 days to avoid traffic jams and also as finding parking during festivals at the Creek can be a nightmare."

It's the more real part of Dubai, no tall high rise blocks and affluence. Lot's of more traditional buildings as well as the old home of the Sheik. The Souq is interesting and you can barter with the vendours quite easily. You can take a cheap and short boat ride (just 1Aed per person) across the water with the Gold and Spice Souq on one side and the clothing Soug on the other. Both are interesting to see. There are some nice restaurants all along the side of the creek and also a few good ones inside the clothing Souq. Early evening is really nice sitting at the restaurant watching the sun set - a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon and evening. When I have friends or family visiting, its a must go to place for me. It's not that old, but then Dubai is only 43 years old anyway, but still interesting to see."

You can rent an abra for 120 aed.The trip takes approximately 1 hour.The boat will head towards the floating bridge then head back, will pass the starting point by at least 1km then will go back to finish the tour.There's nothing much to see in the dubai creek aside from the fishing boats and the birds racing just above the water (in the afternoon I guess)The water isn't clear so you wouldn't see anything.I am not sure if it's allowed to eat or drink during the tour, but at least bring water and some snack if you're bring children with you. Be sure to hit the restrooms before since the tour will take more or less 45mins.The boat has life jackets and other flotation devices, waves are not expected except when the tide is coming.Aside from the abras (wooden motor boats ) I've seen a yacht and a speed boat with tourists probably renting them.It was just an okay experience, just enough to give you a small idea about old dubai."

Worth a visit to the Fort and Museum, however, though the exhibits could do with a refresh.The fake-old Bazaar is a nightmare if you're not a fan of heavy sales hassle. There is a nice courtyard teashop at the far end.Tip: travel there on the ferry from Dubai Marina and get a good trip along the Marina's incredible skyscape, around the Palm island and across the front of the Burj Al Arab.

After the Deserts and the amazing buildings we went over to Dubai Creek for authentic old Dubai experience.The Creek has a boat service which gets you for a low cost from one end of the creek to another. The calmness of the place was awesome. We also visited the shopping area near the creek which had some great authentic merchandise. There was also the Dubah Sheikh's old house which was worth the trip.There are also amazing places for good sheesha over here. So don't forget to check it out."

I remember to have spend many of my evenings there in the the creek not only because there were not many places like the Creed those time but, I always got some sort of positive energy while walking not much crowded creek. The abra used to be dangerously crowded and the innocently rude operators used to shout at commuters. My only adventure those days was crossing the abra paying 25 fils to Dubai side and 25 fils back. That was about the past. The creek has changed incredibly but not to my liking. The walk through creek was not as inspiring as before perhaps because there are a thousand other options. But I love my past."

It's all left on the side of the creek until it is loaded no locked storage no security but nothing gets stolen over night. The fun is to find the most extraordinary items being shipped and these will range from cars and tyres and pots and pans - even toilets! There are cheap cafes along the way to sit end take in the atmosphere or jump on an Abra which you can privately hire for as long or short as you want and peruse the creek itself. We prefer the public abras and usually ferry across the creek to the bur Dubai side and shop at the souq. Barter hard say you live in Dubai as the tourist prices here are extortionate and I would never buy anything at the first price. All the shops sell pretty much the same things so well worth shopping around. A lovely day out ending with another snack at the cafe this side right on the side of the water. Another must that can be done cheaply and if taking the big bus tour is easy to add in."

Labor is very cheap in Dubai so try to get as close to the gram price as you can, allowing for labor and overhead. There also many people offering fake watches, fake purses, you name it. They will hound you!! As long as you know that you are buying fakes is okay. Again, haggle. Be mindful that Friday afternoon between 12 noon and 4pm is the time for Muslims to take a break and many of the shops will be closed. Not to worry, they open promptly at 4pm and continue til 10 pm.

A nice place to grab a drink is the Raddison Hotel overlooking the Creek with a Jazz bar offering great views over the Creek up on the 10th floor. The Gold Souk is a must visit and runs parallel to the Creek, a great way to experience the haggle factor in a very safe and fun environment. The Dubai Museum is also worth a visit.

(A private tour up the creek would have been available for about 120 dirhams). Just queue and climb onto the next available Dhow.... our trip was around 15 minutes each way and to be recommended ...best value ever! So glad that we finally made the trip this visit!!!"

A great way to reach the amazing souks selling spices, gold, diamonds and textiles. If you're lucky a hint of a breeze in summer may cool you a little.

However, if you are not a fan of curry and other spices then you will not enjoy the food that is served. There is rice and salad, but the main food items include these spices. If the food was better, then this review would be a 5.The cruise itself takes about 3 hours and it is relaxing and a unique experience and different perspective of the city.

The staff welcomed us with smiles and got our luggage to our room without delay. The room looked perfect, it was after midnight and there on the bath were bath salts and a candle. The perfect start! I lit the candle, had a hot bath and followed it with a great night's sleep.I guess you can relate to the fact that sometimes when you stay in a hotel you look around and wish you had someone else's room but no, not this time! The next day we looked around, our room was perfect - two balconies - one with a table and chairs and the other with our sun beds. Both overlooked a lovely marina - it was all so very peaceful.From our first breakfast in the buffet restaurant right through to the end of our holiday, the staff greeted us with smiles and absolutely nothing was too much trouble. There were cereals available, continental breakfast and if you wanted the hot breakfast it was made to order and served very quickly.The complex is large as it includes a golf course so it's quite a long walk if you want to visit the shopping centre - no problem! - just mention it to the staff and a unique little car awaits you without delay and you are driven down to the main entrance as part of the service.If you play golf, you will find that it's quite busy but you will also find that you are made to feel very welcome by staff who only want to be reassured that you are enjoying the course.

It is supposed to be the last little piece of historical Dubai containing heritage buildings, a souk, museums, small restaurants, art galleries and a gorgeous view over the busy creek which can be crossed for a small fee with \"abras\" (water taxis). On the Deira side you can see all the old arabic Dhaus (wooden sailing ships), unloading their freight. If you seek for Dubai's history this is THE place to go to!!! on the negative side I have to mention the beautifully reconstructed souk where the shop owners (hawkers!) are actually a disturbance, throwing so called \"pashminas\" round your neck to encourage you to buy it even if you don't want to and bothering with other stuff. this has considerably changed over the last 10 years when nobody disturbed you once walking through the souk and you could easily browse through cloths, silk, shawls, spices...any way some people might not experience this as a disturbance!"

The banks of the Creek are where Dubai originally started, as a fishing port then trading port and then pearling port. Before oil was discovered, it was the creek which gave Dubai its wealth, so much so that the creek was dredged to enhance its attraction as a port. With pearling & fishing gone and containerisation taking port activities to the artificial harbour on the coast, the Creek now serves mainly the tourist trade. While not a lot of the old buildings remain, the water activity gives some idea of the old trading days. On the southern side of the creek is the historic district of the fort now housing Dubai Museum. It is a short walk from the museum to the local souk in a strret on the river's shore, selling souvenirs mainly. Then catch an abra (small boat) across the creek to its northern shore where a short walk away are the Spice Souk & the Gold Souk. An option is instead of the 1 dirham ride across, to hire an abra for an hour's private tour of the whole creek. We did the latter and found it to be worth the expense to see Deira from the water, as well as the various boats docked, both cargo & leisure.Be aware though that abras going to specific places leave from specific docks. Each dock is govt run with an info office which you can interrogate to make sure you are at the correct abra station for your intended destination across the river.All of the above can be done in a day with the souks open until about 10pm. All of the above-mentioned attractions are seperately reviewed by ourselves if you are interested."

A good place to visit is the bank of the creek opposite the Souks. These are traditional emirates structures remodeled to be shops, cafes and restos.

There are interesting souks in he old tradition; small outlets, plenty of haggling and streets full of sections devoted to specific goods. It is said that the Gold Souk in Deira sells some of the cheapest gold in the World, but I cant confirm that! The Spice Souk is also worthy of a visit as is the Fabric Souk on Bur Dubai side. Also worth visiting are the Fort/Museum complex and the Bastakia quarter. Being based on the Creek you have excellent access to the Metro which takes you off to the Downtown areas easily so for us an ideal base of operations."

I have been making short trips to Dubai for a number of years now and usually confine myself to the high rise, ultra modern and sterile shopping malls and the Jumeirah beach area. So this time, having a full Saturday afternoon free to myself I decided to head off to explore the Dubai Creek area.From my hotel in the Mall of the Emirates I got on the Metro and alighted at the Union Squre station. I have to admit that I got a bit lost but eventually found the Creek. After walking up and down the promenade I then decided to board a boat to ride over to the other side & visit the Old Souk. From there I took another boat much later in the afternoon to explore the Gold, Spice and Perfume Souks. In all I walked almost 20 kms that day. There are endless little streets - I sometimes wondered if I was in India rather than the Middle East, there being so many Indian shops and people everywhere. And little place to sit down & have an iced coffee.I returned to the modern part of the town via the Palm Deira Metro station - close to the fish market where the signs advise you that \"Carrying fish on the Metro is prohibited\"."

A great way to escape the over-the-top glitz of modern Dubai and pretend for a moment that you're in an authentic Arab trading post."

The creek was just an obstacle on the way to the airport to be crossed. London neglected the Thames for several hundred years, fortunately for Dubai the rift was less than ten. That thankfully has now all changed. Money, time and effort have really gone into restoring the old town along it's banks. The narrow streets and alleys give a real feel of what things might have been like in the beginning for the early traders. Around every corner is something new and exciting. And there are endless places to stop and take refreshments."

The show was great and am always amazed and how disciplined they are. Staff were great and attentive. We were picked up from our accommodation which was great. This cruise was at the lower end of the budget so probably got what we paid for. Maybe the more expensive cruise has more variety"

You can take a cooling walk in the evangelical along the side of the water, or by evening take a tour on one of the many Abra at a crazy cheap price. We didn't do a tour, but went a 10-15 minute journey from Deira to the Old Souk for the price of \u00a31.20 per person return! By night many of the buildings are lit up, and the restaurant boats are lit up too. This is a fun,cheap thing to do. A must!"

They are water taxis that go from one side to the other for 1 dirham. They are simple wooden boats but with a lot of charm. An abra ride lets you watch the Dhows get loaded from the water and people milling about the souks. It's a short trip that connects the gold and spice souks to the textile souk on the other side. You can also get to Bastakia where there are places to sit and eat along the creek. Keep in mind, bathroom opportunities are limited unless you are eating. You are also outside most of the time and walking, so you are going to get hot, but it's definitely worth it!"

This was where the city was established. Most of the buildings from the early days (which, in Dubai, means only decades ago) are long gone; some have been rebuilt although not always in a way that faithfully represents the original character. Nevertheless there is something special about this busy waterway, often wrongly called a river (there are no rivers in the region). It is exactly the things which have resisted change which give it its character. How much longer that will remain in a place which has an urge to build shiney showey things I can't say. My favourite time is the late afternoon in winter. Spend a one Dirham coin to cross on an abra. No tickets, just join the people who are clambering on, and pay the \"captain\" into his hand after you've taken your place. Enjoy the short ride on the open boat. Avoid the modern closed water taxis. Do it soon before it disappears."

We (a family of 4) rented an entire abra (ferry boat) at a throwaway price for a private short cruise on the creek, and it was simply amazing! The breeze was cool in our faces, and the hectic pace of Dubai seemed a long way off. Perfect way to unwind!"

Although I'm convinced after walking through the markets that everything's owned by a few Emiratis because everyone's selling the exact same stuff, it's still worth it to hike around the markets to see the fabrics and gold. You'd think someone would break out of the mold and try an entrepreneurial approach, but that doesn't happen.Worth the shopping experience but prepare to haggle especially if you look like a foreigner. I was surprised at how the prices were initially - at least 10 to 15 times what I was willing to pay. For example, a T-shirt with a picture of the Burj Khalifa on it should run you about 20-30 DHS but they were initially asking about 200. There was no way I was paying that so it took some time to negotiate down. What I should have realized is that there's another vendor just down the way offering the same damn shirt.

From trade ships near the souks end to tourist dinner tours on lighted boats at night, the creek never seems to bore the eye. Walking along from the Sheraton Dubai Creek towards the souks, the beautiful wooden Restaurant boats gradually make way for bright blue trade ships with the quay side stacked high with tires, boxes and all kinds of assorted trading stuff. Interesting to watch and seeing how the true locals (mostly Indians here) deal with life as opposed to the glitzy side of Dubai. I was planning to go across on a dow but didn't. Each docking station seemed full with locals, only men, and as a solo woman traveler, I found this daunting and wasn't even sure if it was culturally okay so I didn't do it. I could have boarded at a big Dock but that was so close to my hotel it defeated the purpose of how I was wanting to return from the Gold Souk. I wasn't part of a pre-booked tourist tour to include a dow trip; maybe that's worth it but in general I like to do my own thing. Dubai Creek: I'd say definitely worth a visit"

The trip lasted about and hour and I thought well worth the money. The only thing I didn't like was the price of the drinks as a can of coke cost me 4 euros. There is so much to see on this trip and to see all the big yachts in the Marina is unbelievable, there is obviously a disgusting amount of money in Dubai being one of the richest countries in the world. A trip well worth taking."

Don't recommend doing this in the summer unless you are very tolerant of heat, but any time between October and April the weather is quite reasonable. Why go there? See the dhows which still ply their trade with small voyages across the gulf. This trade is what first put dubai on the map when a wave of immigrant merchants arrived and were given permission to use the port as a base. See the buildings which are less than a 100 years old, but still use methods of construction which were in favor for centuries. They are built to be reused and many materials actually made their first appearance in far older structures which are now forgotten. Take a water taxi trip with the people who keep the city running, living a whole other lifestyle quite detached from the 5 star facilities frequented by the upper crust. If you are a photographer the small alleys provide tons of colorful surprises and interesting people. Grab a camera and spend hours looking around."

You can pay 1 dhs and ride the botes that will take you from one side to the other side its like the aquatic bus! They are also other type of transportation that will take you from the creek to other points in dubai.At night you can delight one of the floating restaurants Very colorful at night.

            "review": "A smorgasboard of activities to do!. When you first arrive around the Dubai Creek area, you might feel a bit intimidated by the activity of the many bustling businesses (and hence, pretty horrible traffic) happening on both sides of the creek. However, this is the 'old' area of Dubai, and in my opinion the most interesting. On the Bur Dubai side, you have the Dubai Museum (fun fact: opp the Dubai Museum is H.H. The Ruler's Court complex, one of the most important government complexes), the Textile Souk, and lots of small shops selling textiles, food, and others. Catch an abra (small boat - costs you 1Dh per person!) to the Deira side, and here you find many many dhows that transport materials of all kinds to places like Iran, India, etc. It's fascinating walking by and seeing all the random assortment of things the dhow owners will transport - individuals will give them anything from a huge load of refrigerators, so a small pack of money to take to a loved one. And everyone trusts these guys - it hurts their business model if they were ever caught (or even accused) of stealing something they were trusted with. Also on the Deira side is the Gold Souk, the Old Souk (lots of souvenir options here, from gorgeous lamps decorated in mosaics, to scarves - but it also has plenty of everyday household things so as a resident, I always like pottering around to find something for the house, be it cooking utensils, kids toys to give friends, or anything else. Be warned: it's a bit of a maze, so be prepared to get lost!), the perfume souk (not really very established, but it is there!), and again, plenty of small shops with wholesalers and everything you can imagine. Go a bit futher and you'll find the Fish Market (great, fresh fish at amazing prices) which also has a fruit and vegetable market (in my opinion, the produce here is of MUCH better quality than the fruit and vegetable market out past Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Rd). I do all my produce shopping here. This area reminds you of what Dubai looked like before the construction boom that has overwhelmed pretty much everywhere else. Try and go during the cooler times of the year, as almost everything is outdoors (save for the occasional shop with AC) so you won't get much respite from the heat. Also, sellers will bring down the prices, so be sure to bargain - I always try to get down to 50% (at least!) of their original price, and often I can do much better (if you like bargaining, this place is amazing, but you have to be firm!).The reason I don't give this place a 5-star rating? 'Disability access' is just non-existent. The traffic is horrendous (so coming by Metro, or parking nearby and then catching a taxi into the heart of it is the best way to go - parking is a nightmare), and you need to be wary that quality of products vary wildly - some sellers will happily explain to you that they have both fakes and the genuine article (e.g. pashminas), whereas others will try to trick you, and others just sell bad-quality products outright (I bought a terrible knife that was thrown out straight away). So if you want genuine products, know what to look for (e.g. real pashminas don't flame if you put a lighter to them, real leather won't melt if you put a lighter to them), and do your research. As a resident, I have worked out who I can trust and who I can't, so ask locals/residents if you know any. If you can bargain in Arabic, sellers will be very impressed!You can easily spend a whole day here, so pace yourself, enjoy the ridiculously cheap (and authentic) food and drink you can get at the small restaurants and stalls (Persian, Indian, so many choices!). If you buy something, many shops are happy for you to leave your (heavy) bag of goods at the shop, to pick up at the end of the day just before you go home, so you are not carting it around. Just ask!"

However, the chef very kindly prepared some kebabs for me without any spices. The desserts were delicious.The music was way too loud, to the point where we couldn't talk to or hear each other, and we would have appreciated a commentary every now and then, telling us where we were along the creek.Other than those issues, not a bad night."

Dubai Museum, in the Bastkiya area, is located within the city\u2019s oldest building, Al Fahidi Fort, which was erected in 1787. The house of Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum Al Maktoum, who ruled Dubai from 1912-1958, is considered to be one of the most important buildings in Dubai as it once housed a ruler. This is definitely the place for bargain hunting within the souks: the spice souk (be prepared for a surrender of all senses), textile souk (best pashminas ever seen, but the thought of buying one in such heat completely deluded me) and the gold souk.

Along the creek you will find old style souks that are a fraction of the price of the later air conditioned malls.However, nightime is when the creek really comes to life with traditional Dhow sailing ships decked out to offer guests a cruise up and down the creek, showing it in all of its lit up glory. On the cruises you will be treated to an all you can eat banquet and usually a light hearted show of some sort. These can be excellent value, but for those searching for a slightly more romantic feel, there is the bateau Dubai, which is a floating restaurant offering some fantastic gastronomic delights and a Friday brunch extravaganza.Dubai Creek should not be missed!"

In fact, the shopping all around this area is worth a look for inexpensive clothing and the usual tourist items. There are also many really tiny eateries where the locals eat. Extremely cheap food and really delicious!The water taxi will carry you across the creek for 1 dirham. Pay the skipper on the boat. This will take you across to the other side where other attractions are within easy walking distance: the spice souq, and of course the gold souq. These are not to be missed for any traveller to Dubai.

I love history and historical places but what dubai heritage villages offered was truly dissapointing. Not even the photo opportunities are that interesting. Again it all feels forced and fake.

Took a taxi down to the Dubai Heritage Village to find an obvious reconstruction complete with tourist traps such as Coffee museum, Coin museum and Stamp museum amongst others. After wandering through these streets for a while I headed down along the Creek and through the souk to the abras station to take one of these small wooden water taxis across the creek to Deira. The souk is full of the usual middle eastern hassle merchants who make the journey through it a bit of a gauntlet running experience with guys trying to wrap you up in various headgear whilst shouting at the top of their voices that you must buy something from them. \"Why do you come here if you don't want to buy something\". The abra crossing was a mini adventure in itself though as the boatman will definitely try to rip off tourists. It costs 1dirham to cross but they will inevitably try to get more out of the unsuspecting. The Diera side is a hive of industry and as you stroll along the creekside you can watch the dhows being loaded as they have been for hundreds of years. These days though the main cargoes seem to be vehicle tyres and refrigerators. Further along cross at the lights and into the narrow, shady passageways of the Deira Souks for a look back into history. Try one of the creekside cafes on returning for a refreshing fruit juice. Kiwi is highly reccommended."

The feeling is like you are in a busy market place few hundred yeas back and at the same time on both sides of the creek are the tall modern buildings . It's located in Bur Dubai area which is not far from down town . I can say that without traffic it will take approximately 12-15 min from burj khalifa by car . From Atlantis hotel will be about 25 min . Avoid rush ours : after 5 in the afternoon . What to see : you can park in Meena Bazar area and walk to the Abra ( the old wooden boats) station, where for one dirham (0.27 us$) and together with another 20 people , they will take the passengers to opposite site of the creek . I usually tell the controller \"engaged \" and he don't allow other people on the Abra but the price will be 20 drh ( 5.50 US$ ) . I pay the guy when he drop me to opposite site . There is option one can engage the boat for a 30 min or one hour creek tour but you have to try to push the price down and he will . I love to go and take trips in the late evenings , just to cross the creek and walk 5 min to Gold Souk . It's a very romantic experience especially if you are couple."

The creek is the heart of Old Dubai and still gives a sense of stepping back in time. Dhows line the banks and are a curious site piled high with an assortment of goods from washing machines to bags of rice. as they have for generations! the open sided abras carry passengers to and fro across the creek for the princely sum of 1dh (30 cents). For most of the day, the creek is a bustling commercial hub, however, after an early morning airport pickup, my aunts and I arrived not long after dawn recently. The air was reasonably cool, the creek was still with the early morning light reflecting off the water, and the locals were taking their morning walks along the banks. As an added bonus, wandering through Shindaga heritage village, we were welcomed to ghawa (Arabic coffee) and dates by the charming Yemeni worker who was just making his first brew over an open fire. My aunties were fascinated by the traditional architecture and recreated structures of the village. Following this, a trip across to Deira on the abra brought us to the spice souk. A few shop keepers were beginning to set up shop and we were able to browse the exotic spices. If you can brave the early start, the peace and quiet are worthwhile."

On one hand, you get to go down memory lane of Old Dubai - the old shops, the souks, passenger ferries, etc. And when you go out into the Marina, you come across the Glittering Dubai Skyline rising above the Beach front. You have the choice of doing this on a traditional Dhow Boat or one of the modern fibre glass ones. A word of caution though - Making the whole experience a memorable one with the right ambience, music, food and entertainment is a question of picking the right Cruise. Almost all operators promise the same , but only a few who get it right. Blaring loud film music, no live performers, serving cold tasteless food are some of the common complaints one hears with many operators, so get your feedback from multiple sources before you get on-board. But you do the homework right and it can be THE highlight of your trip at Dubai."

The most interesting part was getting up close to the dhows moored in The Creek. Many are very old and most are laden with white goods, technical goods, spices and any other things you might care to think of. Once laden they set off into the Indian Ocean bound for Pakistan, and East Africa - how they actually make it to their destinations one can only guess! We found the dhow crews really friendly and keen to be photographed - and not for a fee! Great fun, but very hot and few local amenities for refreshment unless like us you are happy to chance the local cafe!"

The shore is lined with different boats and is a hive of activity from sightseeing boats being cleaned to freight transporting boats being loaded. We then got a water taxi for the very cheap 10-minute ride to the Heritage Village across the water which is also worth a visit. It shows old Dubai and explains the history and Dubai\u2019s growth. It is also near the oldest building in Dubai which is now the Dubai museum. After walking around here we caught the excellent Metro to The Mall of the Emirates.

While an abra cannot compare to the sleek, driverless Dubai Metro, it is a very inexpensive way to \u2018cross over to the other side.\u2019 The covered abras depart as soon as they are filled.

You can ride one of the boats for less then 5 Dihrams.

Dubai has a long maritime history and the Creek today continues the tradition of shipping all sorts of things in and out of Dubai using traditional wooden dhows. You can see them plying back and forth, or watch the wide assortment of cargoes being unloaded at the key side. The little ferry boats (abras) carry passengers across and along the Creek for a few dirhams and are great fun. Along the Creek are the heritage areas of Bastakiya and Shindagah. Both have trendy cafes and guesthouses. The Bastakiya is gaining a reputation as an arts' centre and where you will find some traditional courtyard houses with wind towers - a kind of natural a/c which funnel cool air into the rooms below. Across the Creek from the Bastakiya are the spice souk and the famous gold souk. Both are well worth a visit. The Creek is the oldest area of one of the most modern and innovative cities in the world. It's easy to forget you are in the Middle East in Dubai - a visit to the Creek puts the new into context and connects the visitor with the city's heritage and its past."

There are food stalls, games, restaurants, shops around over here and a very local kind market at the end that sells souvenirs among other things. Mostly run by Indians and Pakistanis. We had the cheapest and bestesstt Falafel sandwich here, which is a wrap. It was delish. They have abra dock here which takes you across the river for 1dirham! It was a pleasant ride. We really enjoyed our evening here."

Probably because it's where most of Dubai's non European expat community, who aren't building skyscrapers hang out and work. The Creek itself is a body of water that gives you the opportunity it's to escape the bustle on an Abra \u00a330 for an hour tour per group or 80p per person to cross the Creek. On the Diera side is a plethora of shops that sell everything, get all your pashmina and tatt there as it's about 30% of the tourist trap prices. Be prepared to be asked if you want a watch or handbag every five mins, don't be shy to say no, these people are keen but not aggressive. There is a spice and gold souk which is interesting, fruit juice stalls are nice and if you go late afternoon you can be sure of plenty of shade. It's a vibrant, Indian, Pakistani, Afghan, African mix. Well worth an afternoon. On the other side of the creek there is a heritage site which again is worth a look.Don't bother with the dinner cruises. I've never done one but they don't look up to much. Best get a small Abra and look at them lit up while you cut about the creek. The only thing you need to be aware of is the toilets are......rustic"

Dubai Creek or Khor Dubai (Arabic: \u062e\u0648\u0631 \u062f\u0628\u064a, Khawr Dubayy) is a saltwater creek located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE). It ends at Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary. Some sources say that the creek extended as far inland as Al Ain, and that the Ancient Greeks called it River Zara.[1] Historically, the creek divided the city into two main sections \u2013 Deira and Bur Dubai. It was along the Bur Dubai creek area that members of the Bani Yas tribe first settled in the 19th century, establishing the Al Maktoum dynasty in the city.[2] In the early 20th century, the creek, though incapable then of supporting large scale transportation, served as a minor port for dhows coming as far away as India or East Africa. Although it impeded the entry of ships due to current flow, the creek remained an important element in establishing the commercial position of Dubai, being the only port or harbour in the city.[3] Dubai's pearling industry, which formed the main sector of the city's economy, was based primarily on expeditions in the creek, prior to the invention of cultured pearls in the 1930s."

Once we got to the creek we crossed over in one of the boats. It was very cheap and if you want to you can take a boat tour for pleasure, although on this occasion we were using it as transport. It wasn't entirely clear which boat we had to get on but if you ask they are very helpful. The boat is quite open so sit in the middle if you're a bit water-phobic. You might also need help stepping on and off the boat if your balance isn't great. I really enjoyed seeing all the different people using the creek though and it was just really interesting to compare with a similar place in the UK.

Shops laden with incredible quantities of gold jewelry line long hallways. The gold is of very high quality. The prices, fair - you can look up the current gold trading price and will find the shop prices are very close to it. This place will forge a great family memory. If you do not buy and only window shop, this will consume maybe 30-45 minutes Take a Dubai taxi - usually a Camry, cream body and red top. They are metered, and honest. Inside, on the door pillars between the front and back seats, is a metal tag. It has the number of the taxi. You may take note of it - if you leave anything behind, it is your way to find the taxi. You will get your stuff back. 2) the spice market is a short walk from the gold souk. A wondrous place that you will imagine has remained unchanged for centuries. Big open baskets and gunny sacks are piled high with brightly colored spices. Other bags overflow with sweet smelling dried flowers. Smaller containers hold different kinds of incense, amber. Look for Iranian dates and saffron. They are of the highest quality. The shopkeeper will be happy to offer a sample date for you to try. This will consume 45 minutes. Linger, it is worth it. 3) End the evening with a private dhow cruise. I think it cost 50 Dhiram per person (divide by 3.6 to get US$) for a 30 minute ride. We extended for another 30 minutes for another 50 Dhiram/person. The ride is magical. The night air is sweet and cold, a sharp contrast to the heat of the day. You might need a light jacket. Being on a boat that has remained unchanged in design for hundreds of years and going past elegant and very modern buildings on the banks of the creek is a unique experience. Three hours of wonder between the gold souk, the spice market and the dubai creek cruise. For about $12 a person. Excluding any gold you buy, of course!"

Going down Dubai Crerk is a must as it's at the heart of the old city. Take the Abra Taxi and see the contrast of the old and new.There are some beautiful new buildings, to see going in land. Coming back towards the sea, you'll see the Old Museum, and most importantly the very old houses and the tall Arabian wind towers. Amidst this, you have a bee hive of local traders with the Dhows moored up, with their cargo being unloaded. Heading to the mouth of the Creek on the right hand side is Bur Dubai, Deira a Tower and the very old Souqs, maiden with Spices, Arabian gold jewellery. To get this into your schedule suggest at least 4 hours, either go early morning while its still reasonably cool or after 4pm, and listen to the cocophany of the Mullas wailing from their Mosques for \"Call to prayer\".All in all, Dubai Creek gives you a balanced perspective of the historical and modern blend of a fantastic city. Aptly the old local Arabs are great people too."

A lot of Dubai is shiny & new, so much that at times it feels like a movie lot, and some streets reminded me of the Wild West, where the only buildings are along the main drag in town, with nothing behind that first row. The Dubai Creek, on the other hand, provides you with some actual history. Locals will tell you there's still not THAT much history there, but it doesn't feel quite as Disneyfied as other parts. You can access the major souks (marketplaces) from here, and take a water taxi across to reach others. There are creek cruises that cater to tourists, but you don't get much more on them than you do for a 2dh water taxi ride. The souks are fun, but there's a lot of touristy junk too. Keep in mind it's customary to haggle, and so the price the seller quotes could easily be twice or more what you should actually pay. A good rule of thumb is to start at less than half. Locals advised me that 1/2 the quoted price is the \"fair price,\" but these guys are very savvy, and know fresh tourist pickings when they see them. I knew i paid too much because a few places gave me extras after I paid \" as a gift.\" Be ready to walk away, ignore the guys trying to sell knock-off watches & handbags, and stick to your guns. Be polite, but don't get bullied into buying anything. I had one man run out & wrap a pashmina around me, and had to stop & drop it on a stack of his other merchandise, and my poor crowd & stranger-contact adverse partner had his head grabbed and wrapped in traditional headcoverings twice, with many more attempted :) Great photos... Still, it's an experience! As this is a more traditional area, don't dress like you might see at the Western hotels & clubs- ladies should wear looser clothes that go past your knees, and tops that at least cover your shoulders and don't show much cleavage. Some sites recommend you cover your head in the souks, but I was fine. I brought a scarf to be safe. I felt very safe despite the pushiness and the narrow alleys, and really enjoyed my visit.If you want to feel like you experienced at least a little Middle Eastern culture while in Dubai, the Creek and the souks are a must."

This was my second weekend that I spent going around Dubai and I was wondering why didn't I visit this place in the first weekend. There are various souk's (markets) in Dubai along the banks of the Creek. It depends on which souk you would want to visit. To reach Dubai Creek you need to take the metro through the Green Line and reach Al Ghubaiba and walk to the area where there are lot of ships (called Abra). You will have to pay just 1AED to reach \"Diera\" which is the Gold Souk. We also found a lot of shops selling spices.We caught the ABRA which dropped us to Bur Dubai again on the banks of the creek where we found the textile souk. Please ignore this place if you wish to shop. The fun lies in travelling on the boats and viewing the scenery and the old Dubai where there are no high raise buildings. The birds that fly on the water will surely capture your attention. You will enjoy the hustle and bustle of many sellers and beware of sellers who would wish to sell duplicate goods to you."

Another charming feature of Dubai Creek are the ubiquitous Abra Water Taxis that ply both sides of the creek and are a common form of transport for workers. For around US$0.50 you can enjoy a speedy trip across the water from the Deira side of Dubai to Bur Dubai. It's a bit scary, but well worth it!The Creek area also offers some tasty snacks and more upmarket restaurants on the Bur Dubai side. Try the fresh coconut juice from the actual shell and the famous Shwarma (lamb or chicken in a rolled up chappati-style Arabic bread. Delicious.The best time to visit the Creek in my opinion is just before sunset when it s cooler and you can enjoythe sunset over Bur Dubai."

After being in Bur Dubai you have to cross the Dubai Creek to Deira where the Gold & spice souk is. To cross the Creek you have to take a trip aboard an Abra (a rickety little boat). There are hundreds of \"abras\" which ferry passangers between Bur Dubai and Deira, costing 1 AED (Dirham) per trip and takes around five minutes. The Dubai Creek is not much to look at, but it is the surrounding neighborhoods on both sides of the waterway that provide a peek at what old Dubai was all about. Make sure you take a ride on an \"Abra\", it's a wonderful little journey, offering superb views of the fascinating muddle of Creekside buildings with their tangles of souks, wind towers, mosques and minarets.

Just be prepared to fend off endless merchants trying to lure you into their shops to sell you a fake watch, handbag, shawl, etc etc. The vendors in the gold souq were especially aggressive, but some of the stalls/stores seemed to be favored by locals, so bargains probably could be had for those willing to haggle. The spice souq was much more appealing, also the shops with textiles on the other side of Dubai Creek. Take the 1 Dirham boat ride across the water (feels a bit like the Grand Canal in Venice) and find your way to the Dubai Museum and heritage center at the Al Fahidi fort."

This dropped us close to the textile souk which had a vast selection of fabrivs ad well as clothing and hundreds of pashmina which the shop keepers drape around you in the hope you will buy.From the souk we walked to the restored historic area of Balistrka whete we found a bedoin tent complete with a camel falcon..

You'll face different people selling stuff here - they are really trying hard which is understandable knowing this area is mainly populated by poorer people. Can't say they are too annoying, but if you have issues with patience - better ignore the market completely. This part is roughly 2 times cheaper then newer and more prestigious areas, so might be a good option if you want to save on eating out. But the best part is the boat tour you can have for 25 EUR or so. You just go to one of the boats, say the magic sentence which is \"I want a personal tour with no people in the boat I don't know\" and you'll get it. It's quite a long way to go passing lit up bots, so people attracted by shiny lights may find themselves being in ecstasy during the whole trip. All in all I liked it in here. Didn't spend too much time, so might have missed something, so will definitely come back."

The Creek is a very busy place and a hive of activity.For just a couple of dirhams you can hop aboard a wooden abra for a short ride across the creek to visit the spice souk and the gold souk. The textile souk is on the other side of the creek. Be prepared for some hard selling by the locals, which can be a bit overbearing at times. If you see something you like, enjoy the bartering experience and you can get a bargain, particularly in the textile and spice souks, There are lots of little side alleys stuffed with all kinds of souvenirs and bargains. We found a lovely cafe on the creek bank on the side of the textile souk, which was shaded and provided an excellent view of the creek whilst enjoying a delightful lunch. Give yourself at least three hours to enjoy this experience and go and bag a bargain! Word of warning, the ladies toilets in the car park by the spice souk are the stand up kind and there is no hook to put your bag on. Quite an experience!"

It is one Dirham to cross by wooden abra and the short ride is worth the Dirham in convenience and views of Dubai Creek. There are many old wooden dhows that ply the waterway. Access to Gold and Spice Souk necessitate crossing the creek. I did not see access for handicapped people being to easy but maybe there were other abras that can accommodate.

My husband and I paid for an extended trip and we were taken down the creek and back again. I wouldn't say there was much to see that we couldn't have seen if we had walked, in fact the men loading the ships could be seen at a closer distance if you had walked. It was amazing to see the things they were loading on the most rickety of boats - it looked like something from the Arabian Nights but the men had washing machines and fridges on their backs. Travelling on the creek was cooler however, and it was a lot easier seeing everything from the boat and no walking in the heat. It was unforgettable."

Lots of lovely gift shops, Indian street stands where you can pick up a samosa for less than 50p!!!Then you head towards the boats you can hire a private one if you wish but we decided to take the public one it was 1 dhs each !!!!This boat takes you over the creek . You can get off & enjoy a fresh fruit cocktail, coconut juice( served in the coconut) or a milkshake and watch the world go by & the sunset set over Dubai .A great experience that gives you a taste of the local culture & take in the atmosphere definetly worth the trip!"

Forget about Skiing in the sun, Mega Malls and the Burj - spend an afternoon walking along the creek and then wander into the gold suq on one side and cross the creek by water taxi to old Dubai. But walking along the creek is best, watching the old dhows being loaded and unloaded with all manner of goods - cars, fridges, furniture, ACs, tyres etc etc. Still more dhows and their crews are just relaxing awaiting their turn. Bring your camera along as there is much to photograph. When you are finished you could take a night trip on a floating restaurant. So much of what is best in Dubai happens along the creek."

Although we didn't do the abra ride (at AED1 this must be the best value attraction in Dubai!) it looked worthwhile to give a different viewpoint.We toured the gold, textile and spice souks and bought some excellent dates.

You can see the old harbour, which is still used by dozens of commercial dhows to trade spices, rice and other goods with Iran and nearby countries. These goods are then sold in The Spice Market, The Old Souk and wholesalers in Al Diera. It's a step back in time.

Here you get to experience Dubai as it once was - crowded, bustling, loud, smelly and fascinating. The boats are crewed by very young men, daring to cross seas in crafts that are heavily overloaded and are belching black smoke . Wouldn't stand a chance against the pirates now moving into the area. The old Souk near the water taxi stop also offers bargains so much better than the malls and department stores. The fabrics are superb and a tenth of the price in the UK."

The Abra station by the Spice Souk appeared to be undergoing repairs and so only two docking spots were available, which made for a bit of a wait, but wasn't a big problem. At one Dirham per person per crossing this trip is tremendous value. We enjoyed feeling the wind on our faces enjoying the sights along the creekside particularly the colourful dhows. The Creek feels like the heart of Dubai. Super atmosphere. Well worth a visit. Not for the faint hearted though, getting on and off an abra can feel very insecure, it often rocks as you and others get on, riding across the Creek you are very close to the water with no sides to the vessel to give you a feeling of protection and there can be a violent bump when you dock.

My family rented a boat (120 AED). The boat will bring you along the creek for an hour. As you go along, you can also see the city landscape and the mosques. If not booking the whole boat, it only cost 1 AED for a ride across the river. The market is situated on the other side of the creek and is worth visiting.

When we challenged the driver, he claimed he had said he would take us round half the park, not for half an hour, but either way, we did not get what we had been promised and considered this to be a rip off. Eventually, after some discussion, the driver refunded our payment, however, be warned, it is not worth doing."

Make certain you know the location of the correct ferry terminal to catch the boat to the other side or to explore the Creek. There seem to be concessional ferry terminals and full-fare terminals close to each other. If you walk in the wrong direction from the fort, there are no ferry terminals, just a large white fence that prevents access to the Creek and which runs for several kms.Hiring a boat from one of the many spruikers is much more expensive than the ferry, so be patient and wait for the latter."

Cargo is break bulk, not in shipping containers. The loading and unloading process is still done manually. They ship all kinds of goods, from food items to car tires.There are a quite a few water transport options around the Creek. The cheapest is the abra, which takes you between Bur Dubai and Deira in small, traditional wooden boats for 1 AED. There's also the water bus which does the same in a modern boat and costs 2 AED. As for sightseeing cruises, the Dubai Ferry has several route options, one of which takes you between old and new Dubai.

The Dubai creek separates the Deira side of Dubai from the Bur Dubai side of the city. The Deira side houses the early areas of Dubai and the bustling traditional markets of Arabic spices and incense, dry fruits, gold, cloth and umpteen items that are traded into or through Dubai. The Bur Dubai area houses most of the Consulates and banks, apart from several trading stores and shopping and residential areas. You can take an amazingly reasonable 'Abra' ride for 1 dirham, go travel like a local There are modern boats run by the Dubai transport authority too.The Creek has a Corniche on either side where you can sit and watch the other side of Dubai, watch the boats go by, hear the water against the edges. Every evening the creek comes alive with dinner cruises on old wooden dhows ( now air conditioned for comfort) or the fancier glass enclosed cruise boats that apart from a meal on board take you up the creek and down the other way. The dinner cruise lasting for about an hour and a half to 2 hours.What with the traditional 'dhows' on the wharf on the Deira side that still ply with trading goods against the backdrop of amazing skyscrapers and watching them takes you back in time. If you go early in he day you will be amazed seeing them load the Dhows with everything you can think off including cars, some cut in half old air conditioning units, washing machines even lorries using a simple mobile crane. The Dhows depart on darkness usually for the trip to Iran. Brings it really home to you the trading in Old Dubai."

We went around the area scouring for souvenirs to take home and found a clean, friendly \" souk\" or market. There were spices, beautiful figurines ( camels in gold),glorious textiles from India, enthralling display of candies in a store ( looked like candyland to me) and preserved and vacuum sealed fresh dates (best buy ever). Too bad there was no free shuttle going back to the hotel, otherwise we could have bought more.Going back to our hotel, we found a Lebanese restaurant where we had a good lunch of grilled chicken, appetizer and a plateful of bread with dippings.

However, an evening negotiating (I use the word wisely) the souks of Old Dubai and making the most of the ridiculously cheap boat services is a must-do for anyone. The Creek separates two market areas, one largely for textiles, and the other side for spices and gold (well, all sorts of jewellery actually). My wife found a textile 'shop' with a fabric and design she loved, and we were whisked by foot through a mind-boggling combination of side streets and alleyways to a tailor, who promptly measured her up and had the entire creation ready for collection the following morning. All in, \u00a338 for a tailor-made outfit. When walking around the markets, however, it's best not to be the timid type, as the constant banter from the hawkers could be a little intimidating to some. Also, over the course of our evening there, I deduced that everything, but everything, can be bartered down by at least 50%, despite the sellers' howls of protest. Good entertainment. Whilst there, the boats are a must. For 50 AED (about \u00a39.50) we got ourselves a Creek 'cruise' all to ourselves for 45 minutes which was wonderful. We went at sunset which was stunning. Another day we invested 1 AED each in the 10 minute trip across the Creek from Textile Souk side to Spice Souk side. Brilliant fun to soak up some real middle eastern atmosphere with largely locals. The whole 'shopping' experience was so much better than being dragged from one Mall boutique to another."

One theory is that the word Dubai is a combination of the Farsi words for two and brothers, the latter referring to Deira and Bur Dubai.Others believe that 'Dubai' was so named by people who considered its souq a smaller version of a thriving market named 'Daba'.Either way, if you are travelling to Dubai for its culture and outstanding architecture, make sure you don't get so wrapped up in the glitz and glamour of this amazing city that you forget to take in the experience of the Creek.You will be sampling the heart of Old Dubai and seeing the hustle and bustle as commuters rally from one side of the creek to the other. The Roads & Transport Authority (RTA) offers many marine transport means for public transport users such as Water Bus, Water Taxi, Ferry but for the ultimate experience for just 1 Dirham each way, take a trip on what is considered the oldest means of transportation in the United Arab Emirates, the Abra.We are blessed with family visitors once every year and this is always on top of their to do list. So many tourists experience so many great things in Dubai but seldom get to experience the simple but fascinating way of life. You really get a sense of tradition especially when you take a stroll through Meena Bazaar: Also known by its former name \"Cosmos Lane\", this shopping area is known for its textile shops, tailors and Asian (specifically Indian) clothing stores.It is located along 50B Street (near Dubai Museum) in Bur Dubai.A fun and exhilarating part of Dubai that despite being old, is unspoiled."

Most major cities in the world have bodies of water as one of their highlight attractions not counting Venice which renowned for its canals. Some became focal points the cities. Some of these cities I already visited. London has the River Thames. New York has the Hudson River. Singapore has the Singapore River. Paris has the Seine. Chicago has the Lake Michigan. Cairo has the Nile River. S\u00e3o Paolo has the Pinheiros River. Shanghai has the Huangpu River.For Emirate and City of Dubai, it is Dubai Creek which divides the commercial districts of Deira and historical district of Bur Dubai where the defendants of some of the current ruler of the United Arab Emirates settled and established the country. It is a must thing to do while in that Arabic state.As we toured this marvelous waterway, I learned from my tourist guide that some parts of the Dubai Creek are natural from its inlet at the Deira Corniche where it sources its saltwater from the Persian Gulf while some part are artificial or man-made for further development of the area. The unnatural parts of the creek was a part of the Sheikhs's grandiose plans for Dubai like the Burj Al Arab, Palm Islands and others. Dubai Creek is an attraction by itself but it is also the location of some of Dubai's attractions that our group visited like the Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary, the Al Bastakiya historic area, the Sheikh Saeed Al Maktoum House and many skyscrapers from the beginning of Dubai's economic miracle. Our tour guide also told us that before the construction of the Dubai Metro and before automobiles and the bridges that connects the banks, abras were the only way to cross the Dubai Creek. Abras are a traditional Arabic boat made of wood. I said to him that it is similar to the Chinese Junks that used to be the only way to cross Victoria Harbour. The tour was capped with a Dhow Cruise. Dhows are sail boat style watercrafts. We saw some of the attractions we visited during our bus and foot tour.What a way to experience Arabic culture."

Lovely to have a meal at the side of the creek and watch all the boats go by and then explore the Bur Dubai souq would had a great atmosphere."

It is pretty unique with a blend of ultra modern buildings and high class facilities blended in with it's marvellous historic culture . A trip on Dubai creek is lovely and the spice and gold souks are well worth visiting - such an eclectic mix! You probably only need 4 nights there to experience this but if you are a true beach lover then go for a week on Jumeira Beach or Palm Island if you can!"

Walk back along here, and visit the other touristy souk, where you will be pestred into looking and buying souvenirs. Haggling is essential, ad do not be affraid to walk away. As you walk further along towards Al Fahidi, take a walk through the Hindu are, with its tiny, narrow pathway.I live here and I love doing this on a regular basis.The museums will charge perhaps 3dhs for a visit, and a trip across the creek in an abra is 1dh.

The Deira side houses the early areas of Dubai and the bustling traditional markets of Arabic spices and incense, dry fruits, cloth and umpteen items that are traded into or through Dubai. The Bur Dubai area houses most of the Consulates and banks, apart from several trading stores and shopping and residential areas. Crossing the creek is by road or the metro ( green line) or the choice of an amazingly reasonable 'abra' ride, There are modern boats run by the transport authority too. The creek has a corniche on either side where you can sit and watch the other side of Dubai, watch the boats go by, hear the water against the edges or simply take in a sunrise or sunset. Its a place to walk, jog or simply unwind. Every evening the creek comes alive with dinner cruises on old wooden dhows ( now airconditioned for comfort) or the more swanky new glass enclosed cruise boats that apart from a meal on board take you up the creek and down the other way. The dinner cruise lasting for about an hour and a half to 2 hours.All in all, the creek is a must see area to take in Dubai and its amazing change into a modern world class city. What with the traditional 'dhows' on the wharf on the Deira side that still ply with trading goods against the backdrop of amazing skyscrapers and watching them takes you back in time....such is the magic of Dubai creek and what it offers."

It's not particularly pretty, or clean, and there's not necessarily specific 'attractions' to visit, but it's got a real sense of itself, as if it hasn't changed terribly much in the past few hundred years, except that the dhows and abras ploughing the creek now have electric motors, and the souks have souvenir shops in them. This was, and in some ways still is, the heart of Dubai, and the reason for the original settlement. It's still a bustling cargo hub, with all manner of mysterious goods being loaded and unloaded all day and all night. The souks carry on their traditional business hours (meaning all the good places close around 2:30), and the traditional haggling over a cup of tea or Arabic coffee for your purchase will take you back in time. spices, material, clothes, tobacco and gold are the primary commodities, but even just wandering up and down the narrow souks, savouring the smells and the sounds and the bustle is a fantastic transaction in itself.across the creek from the gold souk is the dubai museum, really worth visiting, and you can also walk through the old town and visit galleries and cafes which have taken up habitation in the old dwellings.recommend to go in the cooler months from September to May, but whatever time of the year, definitely worth a half a day tour, or a full day tour if you're going to take in the museum as well."

The Cruise started on time, the food was good and the Tanora dancer who entertained during the fag end of the trip was admirable. Especially since he had to brave severe congestion on the small boat. What killed the trip was the extreme heat - the boat did not have proper air conditioning and both decks were boiling. Our suggestions that it was uncomfortably warm fell on deaf years as the staff refused to accept it was warm. However you could see restless passengers changing seats and ready to jump into the balmy creek. What should have been a pleasant trip turned to be an exhausting one. A free sauna one could call it if you are prone to look at a glass as half full.PS Avoid seats near the buffet table as the food warmers add to the discomfort."

The abras are open, sturdy basic wooden water transports with benches and a roof, and barely cost anything to cruise you across. Take an abra to the gold souk, browse around at the dazzlingly showy gold shops, the spice market is nearby too. Pick up chewy camel milk candy, and some spices like zattar and sumak. At night the abras are lit up and float by romantically, like a verse from an arabic poem."

Just the walk along it in the south side and then crossing it with an Abra, or why not, hiring one for 1 hour (is not expensive). This is where Dubai started and the abra to cross the creek is the oldest mean of transport in the city. Even today is still very used by the people that live in the neighbourhood. I'd suggest this and if you happen to do it before lunch, then finish it up with some food in the Karachi Darbar close to the last abra stop. Great indian food."

Where Dubai grew into the metropolis that it is, yet they did so bereft of oil. All they had was trade and a mirage. Dubai creek is literally the heart of it all and the closest that anywhere in Dubai comes to having a soul. The sterile glass and concrete does not reign here and you can still cross th creek from either side on the traditional abra boats. The authorities are trying to qualify it as a UNESCO world heritage site. I have my doubts but stranger things have happened.The pirates the smugglers, the wreckers with their false lights: As far as I'm concerned they're all still here. The lights have simply gotten brighter."

Once you get there it is relatively easy to buy your ticket and board. I felt like we were the only \"tourists\" on the boat, so it is definitely a good place to get a sense of what \"the real Dubai\" is like. The boat drivers sit and maneuver the abra from the center of the boat, strange..never seen anything quite like it! But all in all, the experience was enjoyable on the two rides we took across the Dubai Creek. If you are a freak about safety, maybe this experience isn't for you. Yeah don't think we would've gone on it if we had kids or any type of disability. Doubt these are regulated,,and am not sure what would happen if it was to tip over!

As you proceed down the creek you will pass things like the Dubai Museum on your left and the \"old Souk\" and of course Abra stations. on the return leg you pass the Gold Souk and Spice Souk and lots of working Dhows taking goods up and down the coast.It is a good idea to do the cruise to familiarise yourself with the area, then you can either use the hop on/off bus to move around or walk if you are feeling energetic. Personally I would recommend the hop on/off bus.You can of course cross the creek by Abra there are plenty around (like a water taxi).Try and time you visit to see the creek in both daylight and at night. It is quite nice to see the Dhows all lit up taking people slowly up and down the creek whilst enjoying a meal and usually some dancing.You will need to get a taxi or the metro on an evening as the hop on/off bus stops around 6-00 pm.There is plenty to look around each side of the creek and is worth spending at least half a day there."

My wife and I both agree that we would have preferred to spend the evening strolling around the Fountain lake next to the Dubai Mall. There seemed to be far more atmosphere and things to do."

There are also some good restaurants to enjoy along the creek closer and at the Heritage Village area where a meal can be enjoyed creekside.The constant moving about of the small boats (abras) creates a constantly moving scene and in the evenings after dark, the larger floating restaurants add to the colorful scene. The downside for me are the vendors and shop employees that want to push their shawls, scarves, watches, handbags, etc. that I just am not interested in. If you want to enjoy a unique space and take a 1 AED ride across the creek, come here and mix it up with the locals and the tourists."

It's a creek with lots of tourist and small boats taking tourists across and up and down the creek. It's not particularly beatiful - no interesting buildings or historical sites or anything. I would only suggest you going here if you don't have anything better to do - take a stroll along the creek in the afternoon and watch the people."

            "review": "Atmospheric, must-see on a visit to Dubai. I really like the creek area of Dubai. It's so different to the rest of the city and is one of the few places that really has that \"arabian\" spirit.There is much to do there - from visiting the many museums, to going to the souks, to visiting the cultural centers to going to the creek park and beyond. Its too much to see (and especially walk) during the day time so my recommendation is to break up your visit to the different ends of the creek and do it over a couple of days.I typically start at the abra dock end of the creek.The metro for this is al ghuibaiba ( and not creek). If you come out of the main entrance my tip is to look behind you as it can get confusing and you can easily miss the whole creek if you end up walking towards the wrong direction. A good orientation point is the HSBC bank and one of the government buildings (I think its the finance ministry). From this point you are at the corner of the top of the creek and can walk left towards the cultural centers or right towards the abra docks and the entrance to the textile/souvenir souq. The abra docks (abra is the name of the wooden open boats which go back and forth across the creek) have a couple of stops along the embankment. Coming from the metro station, the first dock is the boat which takes you across to the souq stop - baniyas. These boats go very frequently and you will find yourself being loaded onto them. They are open boats so you simply need to walk on and sit down, you'll be squeezed next to every nationality, age and sex - there are no rules that need to be adhered to. You do not need to pay until you are on the boat and then it should be maximum of 2 dirhams per person per crossing. Make sure you have small change available but also make sure that if they take your money and you don't get change that you ask for the change back as sometimes they \"forget\". Crossing the creek on the abra is very quick - a little too quick for my liking as I would have loved to stayed on it for hours, - its fun and you get to be right in the middle of the creek's hustle and bustle. Once on the other side you can head to the gold souq and the spice souq. There are not really any signs so you need to follow your instinct or ask to find the entrance . The gold souq is under cover of a wooden roof but it can get very hot and although its quite wide for a souq it is still crowded. Expect the calls from the shop owners enticing you to come inside and take a look - this is typical for souqs around the world. Apart from the calls there is not really any harrassment. The souq is only really a couple of streets across so its quite small compared to the more famous ones in marrakesch but still worth a visit. The Gold souq merges into the spice and herb souq. Again, it can be quite hard to find. My tip is to look for the spice shop within the gold soug (there are not many) , which is on the corner of an alley - this is the alley which leads to the bigger spice and herb section. Note that there are no shops with refreshments/selling water in the souq so take your own water or be prepared to buy from the men offering cans of coke etc from trays above their heads as they walk around - you'll find these close to the entrance and not further on. At the beginning of my visit I was annoyed by them trying to sell to me but as I got further into the souq and away from them I wish I had bought a bottle or two. After the souq visit you can get back on at the same abra dock and head back to the other side or alternatively walk about 10 minutes up the creek (with creek on your right side) and head to the second abra docks - these also take you back to where you started but the ride is a little longer so extends the abra adventure!Back on the original side of the creek you can either head into the textile souk - which is in a street to the right of the dock (right if you are facing the creek) or left towards the various cultural centers. The textile souq is open air and worth a look. There is not really any emiraati goods to buy - its all of Indian origin but if you look hard enough you can find some quality stuff among the cheap souvenirs.Walking towards the cultural strip of the souq you will go past an art center, a few restaurants (there is one quite close to the creek corner with an ice cream stall outside which has excellent food), and various old style buildings which all house a specialty. My favourites are the sheikh saaed al maktoum house (probably wrong spelling), - this hosts a lot of photo exhibits, old documents, etc which documents the history of Dubai - from the time before the emirates, to the agreements with the oil companies, to the lines of rulership between the different states. The islamic caligraphy center is also worth a visit - not only are the pieces beautiful but you will get invited in for tea with one of the emiraatis who can answer any of your questions. The heritage center is also along this same strip. Some of the houses have fees, some not but none of te fees are prohibitive. My tip is to go to the top of any of the buildings you go into as you get a good view of the modern city from the old and the contrast of seeing the silhouette of the Burj Khalifa in the distance is something quite unique. Also, feel free to open doors and go inside rooms - most of the exhibits are housed behind closed doors due to the sun but lack signs to tell you there is something inside - or the signs are so discreet they are unnoticeable. All rooms are air conditioned and often exhibits are triggered to start when someone walks into the room.You can take boat tours of the creek . There is one from the RTA (the transport system). This does not run very often but if you like to travel on a large, modern air conditioned boat then this is to be recommended. There are two tickets - gold and silver. The gold is 75 dirhams for an hours trip. My recommendation is to buy silver however as although the seats are less comfy, you are then allowed to stand out in the open at the back of the boat and its better for photos. If however you don't mind the heat then its much better to take one of the abra trips or one of the large dhow boats as this really gives you the creek experience.Not far from the creek area is the sheikh mohammed center for cultural understanding and the dubai museum . These are not in the same area as the other cultrual centers however and its advisable to take a map as the walk between creek side and the dubai museums is quite difficult. I have given up quite a few times. The creek is also worth a visit at night as its cooler and the boats are lit up.At the other end of the creek is the creek park. This is beautiful, huge and an unexpected sea of green in the middle of everything. Its a must see but not really doable in the same day so go back with a picnic basket and enjoy its tranquility . At the park end of the creek park you can also head to the nature reservation area and the yacht club if you are looking for some refreshments.My only tip is to take water and a hat as it always seems to be hotter here than in the rest of Dubai and there is not much shade.All in all, the creek is really the best area of Dubai and worth many many visits."

It was a really nice way to enjoy the views, fresh air and relax in the sun, before heading to the airport."

There was little atmosphere, not even background music, and nowhere to stand to take in the air or the views; in truth this area of Dubai Creek is uninspiring.Staff were polite and efficient and were pickup and dropoffs, but overall an anodyne experience.Surely there are better experiences to be had on one of the dozens of boats out there?"

Dubai is a cosmopolitan metropolis which has grown steadily to become a global city, a business and cultural hub of the middle east - once a pearling and oil industry. Today Dubai has attracted world attention. It's even harder to believe that it went through the Great Depression in the 1930s due to collapse of its pearling industry and many local people starved or emigrated to other parts of the middle east. Things to do and see: Dubai Museum in Jumeirah district is well worth a visit if you want to know how far the emirates history goes back to; Burj al Khalifa the tallest skyscraper in the world; Burj al Arab, a 7 star hotel and Jumeirah beach nearby; Dubailand and the Miracle Garden which opened earlier this year; the man made islands such as the Palms and the Globe can only be seen from space and the new hotel Atlantis; Dubai Mall the largest in the world, where one can shop in designer shops and eat international food under one roof and all at duty free prices; the Gold souk and the Spice souk in the Deira district of al Bastakiya; there is also a hop on hop off double dekker routemaster sightseeing bus - you can buy the ticket(s) from your hotel or from travel agent; the overground metro (mickymouse train similar to the London Docklands Railway), local bus or taxi are reasonably priced; Jeep or Camel Safari followed by dinner and entertainment in the desert. Dont forget to cross over to Bur Dubai (old Dubai) for one dirham on the old fashioned wooden boat not dissimilar from the Dhow on the river Nile. Bur Dubai is where the early immigrants came to work or open small businesses. Spend a day here to experience what it must have felt like to live a hundred years ago; check out the old houses and mosques; eat snacks and drink coffee in one of many small cafes or backstreet restaurants; shop in the covered market for pashminas, cushion covers, arab head dresses, kaftans, arts and crafts jewellery; drink fresh coconut water from the street vendor; buy spices and nuts from the old type supermarkets or perfume oils tobacco and saffron from the specialist shops and much more, before returning to your hotel in Deira Creek. Although a muslim state with international languages spoken, alcohol is only served in hotels, restaurants and clubs; dress modestly and don't forget to practice etiquette before going to Dubai."

However, take the time to walk the alleys and narrow streets beyond the landmark souks to take in a global perspective. Just as it is in most of the world, products are imported from Asia. You'll see China, the Philippines, Thailand and other countries as the source of goods on containers sitting outside the local shops, ready to be unpacked. There are shops owned by ethnic Chinese merchants (with Chinese characters on the signs over their shops), including a tailor shop. The streets have an ambiance and flavor so different from the glitzy malls, and they are safe to walk. Immerse yourself. Don't fear getting lost. The districts have large maps posted in English and Arabic (on opposite sides). Take the time to learn about the mounds of spices on display and for sale. The merchants are friendly and helpful. And the abra crossing is a bargain at one dirham."

            "review": "Just love the history and atmosphere of Dubai Creek.. I just love Dubai Creek. Up towards the mouth of the creek is old Dubai - the old spice and gold souks on one side, Bur Dubai and clothing/fabric souks on the other, lots of little eateries/refreshment stalls everywhere, very atmospheric, and the old wooden abras ferrying all mankind across and about their business. Further down, the creek is lined with the modern glass skyscrapers Dubai has become famous for, and parks, and along the creek there are the decorative and colourful old wooden dhows loading and unloading their goods for trading around the Gulf and on to India, Africa and beyond - always interesting to see what's being loaded that day (they all seem to be loading the same stuff at the same time) which can be anything from pasta to beds to second hand cars, loaded precariously one on top of the other. Beyond the dhows you'll see some very smart leisure craft moored up, including the Sheikh's yacht. On the other side of the creek are all the old dinner-cruise dhows of all shapes and sizes. Fascinating to see the contrasts and juxtaposition of the old and the new, I can so easily pass the whole day in the creek area, simply soaking up the atmosphere and the international melting-pot that is Dubai. The best way to cross from Bur Dubai to the Deira souk area is by abra - everyone uses them, and costs only 1dirham, see the sights with a breeze on your face, although the smell of the diesel can be a bit overpowering, though it only take a few minutes, so is bearable, and the water is very clear. The best way to see the whole creek is to take an abra for yourself & guests - 120 dirhams (approx \u00a321/$35) for the length of the creek and back, takes about an hour - just have a word with the abra drivers at the abra pier to arrange, no booking required. A wonderful day."

Yes, this is very damning, and to be fair we arrived mid-summer and it was Ramadan.We left Rome on a hot, but bearable 33C day to arrive in Dubai where it was 44C and unbearable. The saving grace was the ability to check straight into our air conditioned hotel. However, the hotel was awful and in dire need of a major modernisation and upgrade. It bore no resemblance to the pictures on their internet site or their brochures. The staff were laughable to adequate. A kind of Arabic Fawlty Towers!Our timing was poor as it was Ramadan and absolutely no food or drinks (not even bottled water) allowed in public between sunrise and sunset. This meant either staying in the hotel or sneaking a drink on the bus tour we had organised.The tour through the various Dubai Creek attractions (the souk etc) was just too hot to enjoy. Discomfort on steroids! Get me back to my (very bad) hotel!!! I was unimpressed by the brash glitz of the Dubai generally. Super modern, ridiculously high buildings of steel and glass stand cheek by jowl with primitive basic structures clinging to the seaside on the edge of a hot, dusty desert. No doubt it's a wonderful place for the shallow, flashy rich and those who would pretend to be - but not for me. Next trip to Europe from Australia will be via south East Asia. I have absolutely no desire to return to Dubai."

Many of the goods are old and get refurbished and the Dhows leave at night and cross mainly to Iran apparantly. Further along is the Abra station where you can cross to Bur Dubai for 1 dirham or you can negotiate the hire of the whole Abra for a tour around the Creek for a reasonable fee. Nice in the more moderate climate or at Dusk. The Dubai Museum at Bur Dubai is near the Abra Station.If you continue walking on the Sheraton Creek Hotel side you will find the Spice and Textile Souks and further along is the Gold Souk. All are well worth a visit. Nightime cruises around the Creek with dinner are also available at this location. All the workers are friendly.A real highlight of Old Dubai is memorable on our visit."

Great to visit for window shopping!So, if you want to buy goods at a more reasonable price, visit the old city of Dubai. Shop keepers are friendly and helpful. However, be aware that it's hectic there! Quality of goods is variable, so check carefully and shop around. The prices are negotiable so make sure you haggle. The main shops have credit card machines, and many will be happy to accept US dollars using the correct conversion rates too.For me, it felt like shopping in the side streets of India. You'll meet plenty of guys on the street trying to sell fake watches and handbags. Really annoying! So, the old city of Dubai didn't do it for me. The old water taxi's are a good experience and cheap (1 AED for one way crossing), giving a great view of the creek. But use them when its less busy. The gold souks are over rated and nothing special in my opinion. The shops we visited had the same gold rate as in the UK. Each shop has its own design fees, so again, haggle for discounts if you buy anything. You'll need some photo ID for big purchases (security). An average experience, but a great place to buy cheap souvenirs."

For a feel of Traditional markets, and inexpensive souvenirs.... drop by the creek..On the metro, take the Green line and the last stop is the creek.Note for photographers:Sunset and blue hour are really beautiful here....

Lovely short boat trip, lots to see once you're on the water. Totally worth the one dirham you'll have to spend on this. After lunch, we decided to rent our own wooden boat to let us float around the Creek for an hour or so. If you have time, you should do this!! It costs 120 dirhams per hour per boat. Since there was four of us, we shared the fee and really enjoyed ourselves! Boat rental is right next to the place where you (dis)embark the \"regular\" wooden boats."

The atmosphere was great compared to the downtown high roller experience with big towers and flashy food, not saying I don't like this as well. This area needs to be kept up to spec to show people what Dubai was really like less than 50 years a go. A great heritage location to the fast life in Dubai."

The commentry was easy to follow and understand. This is a great way to fully realise the contrast of Dubai; the old and the new merging so well together. The water taxis swish by - no thought to life jackets or even proper seats, everyone just sits along benches. To see the blue and white working dhows was great.

Good thing is they even buy used gold jewelry and if our item is less than that they pay in cash. Kanz jewellery ( the owners of world's biggest ring) is a good shop there and good service too."

The rates were varying from 125- 250 AED, sometime negotiable but not much. WE took Dhow at Dubai Marina, amidst high rise towers, but far away from Creek. This dhow is costlier 200 AED, but perhaps due to working day and last minute phone call got us at 130 AED. You can see the beauty of each and every tower here with close distance which may not be there at creek."

You get to see the old dows that still trade and transport little nik naks all across the ocean to trade once in Dubai... they love onboard the boat so you can get a real feel of what it was like back in the day!

Water is always a good way to energize oneself so after crossing a couple busy boulevards, we found ourselves at the correct marina docks to catch a water taxi. They were fairly abundant and the fellows at the ticket booth and cue were fairly helpful. I believe we waited about 15-20 minutes as it was mid day. Once aboard on this ferry filled with a wonderfully internationally mixed crowd, were able to observe other water craft and many of the beautiful examples of architecture in this area of Dubai. Our destination was The Old Souk. The cost of the water taxi was quite affordable and I was glad to spend some time on the water. By the way, the term creek is used lightly I think canal or ever river would be more appropriate!"

So if you take an abra ride(1drh for a ride), or a dhow cruise, you will get to see both:the little open markets(souks)on one side, and futuristic Dubai skyline on the other. Dhow rides often come included in the price of the city tour, and it is an excellent opportunity to see the Creek, because you don't get a chance to see it from the Metro.If you want a more romantic ride, you can opt for a dinner dhow cruise, and you will see the Creek in all its nightly glory.I do recommend taking a ride on the Creek, even if its just to escape the heat of the city!"

The trip takes about ten minutes and is well worth taking - it almost feels like a little getaway from the city while cruising over the water. Crossing the creek on an abra provides a spectacular view of the Dubai skyline, and birds will accompany the boats all the way across. As you come into the Bur Dubai side, you can see the ruler's court standing out proud (the huge white structure - beautiful and hard to miss). The Creek is the reason Dubai exists - it's where the first settlement was built and was the driving force behind the early pearl trade with the outside world. Go onto Deira side, from where the traditional wooden dhows still trade with the sub-continent, Iran, east Africa, and you'll see all kinds of goods being loaded - from canned milk powder to trucks!Then walk into the old spice and gold souks and on around Naif Road, a fascinating old shopping area. Get the abra ferry across to Bur Dubai and visit Shindagah, site of the original settlement, which is being renovated and rebuilt. You'll find museums, Heritage Village, Sheikh Saeed's House and several great open-air restaurants. Certainly an amazing adventure!"

Stroll through the textile souk and continue past the abra station and along the creek until you reach the Heritage village. Take a look around the displays, watch an Emirati show, or just relax at a table by the creek and have a meal or cold drink. Continue past the Heritage village until you see a pedestrian tunnel which will take you under the creek. Once on the other side, head towards the gold souk, and be amazed by the amount of jewellery on display. Then its on to the spice souk. On the way you should pass the Old School and a merchants house. If you have time, step inside and see what life was like in the 1900's in Dubai. Stock up in the spice souk then head to the water and take an abra for 1dhs back across the creek where you will finish your tour back in the textile souk.

It is very disappointing because in the offer it was written that all the food is unlimited!,the voucher cost 39 aed and we bought it from cobone.com and the regular price is 100aed , and the other people bought the offer at 100aed a waste of money!.and take note that the cruise ended early,about 35minutes only! So pls guys, dont ever attempt to book for this kind of cruise, because after all you will be disappointed and annoyed!"

The boat is a little bit rundown then the others but it is still worth going on the boat.Tip 2: Do not go on those fancy boats because they cost more and they use the same route anyway.Tip 3: If i am not wrong, there is a Deira boat station somewhere near the Spice Souk. So aske around or ask your taxi driver and he will be able to help you out.Tip 4: Wear some sunscreen because you will be under the sun for about 15 minutes. Tip 5: Prepare your camera well in advanced because when you go on the boat, you might be too busy to enjoy the view.If you think my reviews have been helpful to you, please click 'Yes' for 'Was this review helpful?'"

And we had taken the evening Dhow cruise, so we saw the illuminated Dubai city along the creek, and it was an awesome spectacle. In the daytime, you will be able to appreciate major buildings better in the daylight.A brief description of the Creek Dhow Cruise:- The tour bus drops you off at the Creek.-You board the Dhow boat, where a special table will be waiting with your name on it-At around 8:30 pm, the cruise will start-The boat moves very slowly along the creek, with arabic and instrumental music playing all the while-Food will be kept -Veg, non veg, everything with drinks. You can have whatever you want to your heart's content.-Staff are VERY friendly on board.- At around 11 pm, the boat reaches back to where it started, and the tour agent bus drops you off at your hotel."

The Dubai Creek is an inlet off the Persian Gulf (usually referred to locally as the \"Arabian Gulf\" because the GGC members don't like to give the Iranians credit for anything). Wooden sailing vessels called dhows have called on the port of Dubai for centuries and to this day there are dhows big-and-small moored along the Dubai Creek wharves loading up for voyages to Iran, Pakistan, India andf elsewhere in the region.A walk along the dhow docks watching the huge old wooden vessels being loaded with everything from used cars to tires and modern electronic goods like refrigerators and air conditioners can be fascinating. The dhows themselves look like they'd be an accommodation horror show for mariners plying their way between regional ports but there appears to be no end of sailors to man these seagoing dhows.Be sure to jump onto an abra (water taxi) to get from one side of the Creek to another for only one Dirham. For 120 Dirhams (about US$35) , you can hire a dhow and \"captain\" for an hour of cruising up and down the Creek. The spectacle of commerical Dubai with its high-rise buildings alongside these creaky old boats being loaded to their gunnels is a real, and affordable, treat."

You could then take a walk along the creek on a very good pathway to enjoy the sites at your leisure. The silk souks are a treat for the eyes with all the colours of the rainbow displayed beautifully. Be prepared to be bombarded (in a nice way) by the stall sellers all wanting to be your special friend wanting to sell their wares, anything from silks, imitation rolex watches, bags, clothing, shoes, souvenirs etc. Experiencing a river taxi (abra) for 20 - 50 dirhams is a must and they take you across to the spice, perfume and gold souks which are also very interesting and the beautiful aromas will entice you to discover much more than you would imagine. There are well signposted (English), clean toilets along the way and plenty of shade which is essential.I can't say enough about Dubai Creek - just go there and you'll most certainly enjoy if you love a bit of adventure.

The only thing we had to pay for was the museum and the abra across the creek. It was a long walk which we did later in the afternoon, however it was a Saturday and it seemed like everyone else from Dubai was there as well. Don't so this in the summer months or middle of the day as it will just be too hot. I found it hot enough when we did it and the tunnel was very hot and stuffy. By the end of it the kids (6y.o. to 12 y.o.) were exhausted but good in a way as they crash on the bed when you get to your room.We didn't go to the restaurants around the area but some looked nice. The creek cruise is not worth the money. You have to haggle your price at the souks and never accept the first price they give you, a good tip offer only a third of the price they give you and if they don't come down to that then walk away; most of the time you will find them running after you agreeing to that price in the end. It was a sensory overload with the colours and smells down some of the little allyways.The kids favourite part was the museum and we could have spent longer there then what we did."

If you get a choice make sure you ask for the upper outside deck and for a table on the edge - we were given this but I think that was because our hotel booked the trip.

This main artery running through the old part of Dubai is an essential experience for tourists, who might otherwise get the impression that the city is nothing but shopping malls and glass skyscrapers. Spend some time on both the southern and northern sides of the creek. The south bank is more picturesque and touristy, with the charming Bastakiya district providing a glimpse of the traditional local architecture, densely set along shady narrow alleys. About five minutes walk downstream is a cloth bazar and a strongly Indian district with tiny shops selling trinkets and flower garlands for use in the Hindu temple. You're right beside the waterfront here, and for a few cents (I think the fare is 1 dirham)you can take one of the little abra ferry boats across to the other side. The northern bank of the creek has a busy waterfront where the cargo is loaded on and off ocean-going dhows. Most of the bazars are also here, a few blocks from the water. The spice bazar, selling mounds of such things as indigo and turmeric, is colourful and fragrant. Dubai has been a trading centre for centuries, but in this area near the mouth of the creek you can get a sense of how things were before trading involved global corporations and stock markets."

We went right up as far as the pontoon bridge, past a royal summer palace and back again. A lovely way to see the city, but without the benefits of the humorous yarns spun by the London River Cruise pilots!. We then ate in the restaurant near the jetty reached via the market - sorry can't remember the name but it had a terrace on the water only used in the cooler months - like now.A lovely day out."

There really isn't much culture in Dubai, if you're looking for it, honestly, forget it!However, if you do crave some novelty of culture or would like to see something of old, then \"the creek\" and it's little ferries is it. The Creek is a small segment of old dubai, unlike the name, the Creek is more like a widened river canal. The only thing that truely makes it old is the myriad of small wooden boats that coast people back and forth for 1 dirham.It's quite an interesting little trip if you can spare an hour. There are no life jackets, now safety precations, just an old wooden boat, battered from use over time (seriously, the wood looks roten on so many of these boats, but it adds to the experience of it all)When you journey on one of these, you can't help but be charmed by how many of these littered the waterways and how seemlessly they putt along to their destination.It's quite a liberating experience and it's one of the only moments where you feel like a local (local migrant worker to be specific).One of the things you will soon realise whilst on this little journey, is simply the fact that there are no local Emirates travelling on them, just migrant workers. Overall, the ferry crossing is a lovely, relaxing cruise. It's a pleasant means of travel that'd no doubt be worth a couple of pictures."

Halfway along past the Rolex towers you'll come to the first Abra station. For a dirham you can take a small wooden dhow across the creek to Bur Dubai or keep going and you will come to the gold souk, spice souk and even further along the fish souk.

Park your car near the museum, and start walking through the textile souk. Lots of trinkets, clothes, pashminas, thobes, materials and treasures to be found at a bargain. Try the 'disco sandwich at the little sandwich bar at the beginning of the souk - yum yum yum; plus the freshly squeezed orange juice - can't go wrong. Keep walking under the wooden tressles until you reach the a bra/ taxi rank on the creek. Hope on a 1 dirham abra to get to the other side of the creek and alight at the ' gold souk' stop. On the opposite side of the road you will find the spice souk - enjoy the colorful array of spices presented in Heshen sacks, and smell the amazing aromas! Be friendly to the vendors and they'll be super friendly to you! At the back of the spice souk, you'll find the gold souk - lots and lots and lots of gold! Know your pries and know how to bargain! A wonderful, authentic, fresh day out"

Dubai Creek is one of the few authentic place in Dubai and I really love it for years and years now, it is my favorite place in Dubai and one of the most beautiful view if you stay in the old Sheraton or the Radisson on the Creek(formerly Intercontinental Hotel). It is not that easy to explore because of the heat now and the parking problem but it is worth making an effort because it is a bustling and extraordinary place, where the real Sinbads still are! It is one of the few harbours where you can still see the real dhows doing real trade. You will see the Indians (and other nationalities) dockers pushing hand carts in the middle of the traffic and taking the boxes of everything under the sun: fridges, TV, cooking oil, sinks, plastic items of every sort... to beautiful wood boats (some looking like ships you see only in Pirates of the Carraibeans or in Disneyland Paris Pirates grotto, it is the one I know!). On these graceful and traditional dhows are the sailors in their lunghis, T shirts and flip flops, who will cross the Arabian sea, the Indian ocean and bring their cargos I don't know really where but you just dream when you see them, you are taken to another time and age. You can walk near the boats, take some photos, but for me I never wanted to take one of these dinner cruises, I prefer to watch the real thing, not to do the touristy bit! When we use to stay at the old Intercontinental Hotel, I use to love watching the creek and the boats from the little balcony with its scruffy clump of bougainvilliers stubbornly surviving in its dry pot. Now there are more fancy hotels, but none have this delightful view."

First off, as this review is for the Creek itself, I will start by saying that it is a fantastic resource and well worth a trip by whatever means you choose. The sights on the river are almost as fascinating as the sights on the shore! Choose your time of year carefully if you don't want to get steamed slowly to death by the humidity though.The speed limit on the creek (estuary really) is posted loud and proud at 7 knots so it is as funny as hell watching the police boats planing up and down at 25-35 knots creating huge wakes that nearly tip the abras over along with the heaving masses clutching at their seats for want of a single life jacket amongst them!The mosques opposing each other over the water have a proper sound off going on with each competing for 'loudest and most distorted call to prayer' all at the same time... result? Pure noise pollution and surely no-one can understand a single word. Pity.We took a 'Dhow' dinner cruise (read: modern boat with tacked on wooden superstructure, not a Dhow at all) afterwards we had to re-live the experience and giggle that it was more like a river tour up the Ganges than the Dubai creek! Pure Indian culture, Indian food, Indian music and... wait for it (I kid you not!) an Indian conjurer complete with cheesy soundtrack and a tuxedo! Kids, you may need to Wiki 'conjurer'.Good fun but not a skerick of Emirati culture in sight, in fact Karama seems to have been given over totally to the subcontinent."

Cheaper option would be take the metro to Union station or Baniyas Square and walk from there or a direct a cab (standard distance based fares, one good thing about Dubai). Evenings are a good time for a nice walk, lots of shops and eating places line up either side. You could take a 2 dirham dhow crossing (one very 5 mins or so) from the Deira to Bur Dubai Souk (traditional market) or engage any of the upmarket cruises operating the dinner tours.Memorable Moments\u2022Watching the fireworks (happens every night during the shopping festival, the bridges are also tastefully lit) on a traditional mega dhow operated by Radisson Blu Deira (one of the 5* down town options, which I can also recommend).\u2022Watching the ever evolving Dubai skyline from the cruise, do carry a nice camera.\u2022Splashing creek water on the low surface motor dhows operating across the creek."

We had the transport card that allows us to take the newer water taxis at a discounted price but we choose to take the traditional Dhow which is only 1 AED per person. Walking along the older streets of Dubai and taking the tradtional Dhow is an assult on the sense, sight, smell, sounds & feel. Squeezed wth many other passengers, tourist and many foreign workers we sat facing out along the dhow. The Creek was relatively clean with not much debri or smell. Along the other northern side where we alighted were many cargo ships loading or offloading goods which l understand was destined to other Middle Eastern countries. It was a hive of activities which was very interesting. The creek and old Dubai Area felt safe enough although we did get stares as we walked through old Dubai streets.I love the creek & old tranditional Dubai because its not tainted by comercial tourist setups..yet. Coming from a city where its modern and filled with Malls and Skyscapers, the creek & old Dubai area is a place I feels connects me to the real Dubai."

The creek being a natural port, give birth to a thriving market with boats loading and unloading their cargos and people from different parts of the world doing business. Of course it was much smaller than what Dubai is today and it is difficult to visualise those early days of small fishing villages next to the creek but you still can catch a glimpse of that era by watching the wooden boats (called Dhows) taking in or unloading their cargos at the creek side. If you are visiting Dubai or even a resident of the city, you should do a creek cruise not only to get a feel for the city and its early days but also to look at the city from a different perspective. Of course if you want to avoid the over commercialised cruises then an alternative will be to cross the creek in an Abra, which will be much cheaper but you will see only a small portion of the creek."

A cracker show is held in the evenings and that was the icing on the cake. In simple words it took my breath away. A nice evening spent at the creek and shall be cherished for a long time. Parking is difficult to find. So if you are driving, reach early or take public transport. Also there a number of boats offering sailing packages for about two hours with dinner thrown in. Do take this offer. For approx 100 AED it is worth it."

Spent an afternoon wandering along the creek, it was very nice, you get a great view of the buildings on the other side, and there is some amazing boats, including floating restaurants on old dhow's. Everywhere you see the contrast between the old boats and traditional buildings, but with the huge skyscrapers in the background. The old abra's (water taxis) are a nice sight. We took a ride on a small boat which was great, all the way up and down the creek from the floating bridge down to near the open sea, was only about \u00a320 for the hour for just the two of us. Could spend many days wandering about here taking in the atmosphere."

The spice souk is laughable if you have ever sneeezed in a real spice market, The gold souk is average and I never even found the perfume souk. The creek is all you may ever see of the 'older' Dubai, but its been sanitised and redone for tourism so its not very authentic. The abra ride is nice, crossing the creek. spend a morning here or a late afternoon."

            "review": "Old Dubai's heart and soul..... The old Souks sit either side of the Dubai Creek, textile ones on the south side, spice and gold souks on the north side. These are the inevitable destinations of anyone visiting the Creek area. There's also a nice cheap n cheerful indonesian style restaurant that sits above the water, accessed from the second textile souk, that gives a great view up and down the Creek while you enjoy a pleasant lunch (if a tiresomely long wait for service). If you want to buy something in the souks (in the textile ones I'd go for the traditional man's headscarves) you'll be expected to barter. It's actually fun, and the guys there are not pushy and nasty about it like some in the Far East can be, but you'll be constantly approached to see if you want to but knock-off watches, etc, but just smile & decline. A word of caution though, it's fine to chat and have a bit of banter with them, which they will appreciate, but if you don't want to buy, don't start bartering with them. When they get to their final price with you they'll expect you to buy, and not to would be offensive. I always say I'm not buying today and they're quite happy to chat and show their wares without any pressure. Once you start bartering it gets serious and you should expect to buy.The fun bit is to take an Abra across the Creek from the one side to other, from one of the Abra stations. It costs 1 dirham each way, which you give to the boatman once on board. I'd recommend going up to the second station (the one closesto the ocean end of the souks), which then drops you off at the Abra station right by the spice & gold souks. The other one drops you further down the quayside on the north shore which means a longer walk. Although European Health & Safety officers would have kittens at the Abra arrangements, be brave and put up with the boarding hop on board and the squashing up as you sit on the central shared seat. It's been like this for donkey's years here and you'll get a real flavour of authentic original Dubai life, not the plastic Disney style you get with the electric, cushioned Abras on the waterways of the Madinat Jumeira.Further out along the south shore, towards the sea, you will see the collection of restored original buildings that comprise part of the Heritage Centre. Its a bit of a walk from the textile souks to get there but worth it. There's the old Sheik's palace and a building that now houses the Architecture musem, which is really worth seeing. Again, gives a good sense of what it might have been like here a hundred years or so ago.A visit to this historical area around the Dubai Creek is well worth doing, even if you're only in Dubai for a few days. You realise taht there's more to Dubai than just the sky scrapers and five star hotels....there's a real life side to it too."

The Dubai creek is in the heart of dubai, separating Bur Dubai from Deira.The creekside is a fantastic place to ride on an abra, waterbus or just look at the water and relax.You can use the abra to cross the creek for just 1 Dhs. the abra is the conventional way of crossing the creek and residents use to use the abra to cross before there were bridges and tunnels. The arbra has a capacity to accomodate around 15 people; and has longitudnal seating. The abras leave when they fill up, which is every 3 minutes or so during peak timings.The modern way to cross the creek is by the Waterbus, which is like the abra operated by the RTA (Roads & Transport Authority). The waterbus costs 1.80 AED and you can use the NOL multipupose card to pay. The 36 seater waterbus is more comfortable than the abra, with Air condition and proper seats. There is a waterbus every 15 minutes or so. There is also something called the Water Taxi which is a much costlier option, with prices ranging from 60 to 160 AED.The night cruise on the creek with a lavish dinner is a really worth trip. There are many private companies operating dhows. The prices start from AED 100 for a small dhow, reaching upto 500 AED for a luxurious ship with panaromic views."

The Creek is in \"old Dubai\" and is a million miles away from the glitzy 5 star modern Dubai, and if this is what you want don't waste your time on the Creek.However, to miss the Creek you would be missing out on what Dubai was and in fact is. Dubai is a trading town and trades with it's Asian partners and the Creek is where it all starts. We went to Bastakia and the old quarter which is on the Creek and fascinating, from there we walked to the abra station and for the sum of AED 1 we rode to the other side and visited the original gold souk. This was a priceless experience and on the next day we came back and did it again. My only word of caution is that our visit was mid season, attempting to do this in the Summer months would be difficult because of the heat."
