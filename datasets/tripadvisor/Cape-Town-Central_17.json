It has developed from a small fishing village into a thriving community. You can still visit the beach and fishing wharfs and some restaurants serving the catch of the day, but there is so much more to discover away from the waterfront. Cute shops and restaurants and the Friday night and weekend market. There is also a nice little animal sanctuary in town."

Over the years it has developed into a sometimes hectic large suburb with thousands of houses, an informal settlement, hundreds of businesses and restaurants. But is still very scenic. Its worth a visit.Some suggestions- Chapmans Peak Hotel (good seafood, great sunset spot overlooking a beach)- access point to Chapmans Peak Drive, possibly the most scenic spot in Cape Town- the food and goods market at the harbour- World of Birds (quick and easy way to see a variety of African birds, especially raptors)In truth, the beach is not great and the waters are polluted (but the City is working on that)"

Cape Town about 1-1/2 Hour drive and a fishermans wharf that caters boat tours studded with sail boat wharfs and good sea food restaurants. We went to the Mariners Wharf restaurant and had a good seafood lunch. I recommend the \"Kingklip\", baby kingklip.

There are quite a few eateries in the area and lots of local vendors selling their wares.From here we drove to Chapman's Peak which has the best views over the spectacular Houts Bay. So very pretty. There are quite a few vantage and picnic spots along this scenic drive. If you are heading down to the Cape make sure you go along this road at least in one direction or you will miss out on some of the best scenery in South Africa."

This is a quirky little town which developed around a natural harbour, its scenic attraction is highlighted by the rocky bastions which guard the entrance to the sheltered waters. At one time it was a very busy fishing harbour, but sadly, as catches diminished, so did the activity in the harbour. Today it is a dormer town, with many folk who work in Cape Town, 20 kms away,chosing to live here. It is still a pretty place, but if you are considering a visit, try and time it over the weekend, so you can catch the markets. There are more than enough activities around Hout Bay to make it your holiday base - and there are really a huge variety of restaurants from which to choose!"

You have the best seaviews and can go for a boat ride. Offers a lot of pleasure. Or just hang out on the beach and enjoy wading in the water. I know that you will enjoy the Curio shops and just walking around the deck is a must see an do. Quite a safe area with less incidents. Not aware of anything major going on.

Since the waiting time for the ferry was nearly 40 mins we took a slow stroll and searched for a place to take some fish and chips. The chips was so well done in all senses I found it really nice. The 65 rand ferry drive is worth the money as you will have a lot to look out for. Especially the picturesque views."

The excellent restaurants, Mariner's Wharf and The Lookout Deck offer culinary delights next to the more informal take-away outlets within walking distance.Tourists enjoy the many African stalls offering local and imported African crafts of all materials and designs.

For 2 adults and three children we paid a little over R600,00. We went out on a medium sized vessel. It was clean and safe. There is an inside cabin with a bar and for those who want to there is an area in the front of the boat to ride outside in the open air. It is pretty choppy an dhilly in the winter. My son gets motion/sea sickness but he did just fine on the inside of the vessel. There are little stands on the pier to purchase gifts but I thought they were a bit expensive. The people were a bit pushy but overall it was a great experience. We got so close to the seals, it was amazing. They were chatting and playing with one another...amazing. I would recommend a trip out there."

I was lucky to see a couple of whales in the bay. When you travel here you should take your time and stop as often as possible.

A walk down the pier, chatting to local fishermen and listening to them explain how they go cray/lobster fishing in their \"junks\"was informatively interesting. met with a local who was making money having befriended a \"wild\"seal and using the seal as tourist attraction was scarily exciting for me. I know better than to get up close to a wild seal! the local Craft Brewery is an excellent stop over to quench one's thirst. Their ciders are unique! If you lucky like me - Jeffery would be happy to take you through the processes of how he makes his beers. Ask nicely! The Friday evening flea market is a definite place to hang out with locals - being early winter and already very chilly by Durban standards - the fireplace, food and wine are a big draw card. How the day/evening passed so quickly...it was time to leave but not without the cray fish tails we had bought earlier in the day."

Have some calamari and chips or whatever fish you like when the salty air hits you and you get hungry. See the antics of Norman and Nicholas the seals as their trainer feeds them while you take pics of them. You can feed them too,by the way.They are only two of the many amazing seals that inhabit the waters nearby. It's always windy here so definitely take along a jacket. The weather changes quickly to cloudy so you have to be prepared."

Now that we have retired and live here, we fine every excuse in the book to make the long trek to Hout Bay whenever we can. Its an institution. Although the prices have escalated a bit over the years, we still find it such good value and a lovely BIG box of fish and chips is always on the cards. FRESH from the sea, nothing could be better.

What is now a reality is an endless stream of unemployed beggars and 'help me - family of many to feed' board waiting at every traffic light, a sense of discarded sadness and littered fear, overflowing from the Brazil-like squatter camp called Imizamo Yethu that now dominates the once quaint village of Hout Bay. Getting there from Cape Town or the Southern suburbs: The narrow Constantia Nek road is a time consuming nightmare, should you have the frequent misfortune to be stuck behind a truck or bus. If possible, use the scenic Chapman's Peak Drive (there is a toll imposed on using this road) or use Victoria Road (M6) from town via Camps Bay.The harbour is still functioning with its array of seafood delights and friendly seals. The fishing boats still come and go, but Hout Bay is a polluted former paradise where all the roses that grow have very sharp thorns indeed!"

There are market stalls selling goods, some are very reasonable but you need to barter."

Although very picturesque, Camps Bay seemed a bit crowded every time we passed by it. Instead we decided to stop at Hout Bay. The sheltered bay of Hout Bay has a white sand beach which didn't look as crowded as Camps Bay. After enjoying a nice lunch at Mariners Wharf we spent some time on the white sand. Unfortunately the water was too cold for swimming. Right next to the beach is the pretty Hout Bay Harbour, still an active fishing harbour. From here you can take a boat ride to the Seal Island, a small rocky island where you can see plenty of fur seals. Hout Bay is a perfect spot for a lovely afternoon."

The Nauticat is one of the number of charter boats that take one on a short trip into the bay and onwards to Seal Island.The trip takes about 40 mins and offers spectacular views of the surrounding mountains, as well as the seals at Seal Island. This can be classed as a minor sea trip so do not feel concerned about sea sickness. The boat travels quite slowly so there is minimal pitching and tossing.Take a warm top just in case, put on sun cream, take the camera and enjoy the trip ! Take the left hand side of the boat as this is on the side of Seal Island - where the boat stops for 10 minutes or so.Costs (23 Feb 2016) was ZAR 85 for an adult. Other boats charge less(or more) but I found this good value and there was ample space for sitting or standing. Sit outside for a bracing experience.Turn up early and you will be treated to the locals feeding seals. Also take a walk around the harbour, buy some fish and try one of the restaurants.Even though I am a Cape Townian, I thoroughly enjoyed the trip !"

Will probably always tell the story of being advised (Loudly and with some indignation) by one said seal to get out of the way...as I was standing between him and his treat-dishing friend. My husband is just sorry he didn't have the camera on to record the scene!We didn't eat here but the fish and chips smelled good, there were locals buying fresh fish and an interesting menu. Definitely enjoyed the visit."

This is a great alternative for those who do not want to go to Woodstock's Old Biscuit Mill market. Hout Bay's market offers great food, music, atmosphere, clothes, jewellery and crafts made by communities and young entrepreneurs. Come and support the locals!! Out Bay is at the start of chapman's Peak - a scenic drive that winds up and down taking you to Noordhoek, Kommetjie, Kalk Bay, Boulders (the penguin beach) and other equally amazing must see sights like the Cape Point/Cape of Good Hope which is the most south-westerly tip of the continent."

Note you can't get off the boat onto the island.. it's just a huge group of seals living together on a huge rock, and the boat drives around it and stops for a while.You can also buy fish here direct from the fisheries for quite cheap, but be careful of buying their previously-frozen fish, and also buying during peak tourist season.. it's advisable to know what the going rate is before you buy.There's also a Naartjie Kids clothing factory store (above the Spar grocery shop / opposite the Engen garage) that have amazing sales occasionally (go as soon as the sale starts, else you wont find anything worth buying). To the left of the Spar, where the bar is, you'll also find a Bug Zoo kids clothing shop (not as nice as Naartjie), and a pretty decent clothing shop for grown-ups opposite it.There are 3 roads into Hout Bay.. one tolled road via. Chapmans Peak (most amazing drive ever), one from Kirstenbosch gardens, and one from Camps Bay beach. Chapmans Peak is sometimes closed when the weather is bad, for safety reasons.. try and google the road status before you go, but it's normally open on great sunny days (obviously the best time to view any panoramic nature)To maximise your views and photo ops, I highly recommend getting there from Camps Bay, and going back to Cape Town via. Chapmans Peak and Silvermine Nature Reserve (it's a longer route, but so worth the views). Also, Silvermine is one of the top attractions in Cape Town.. Chapmans peak also has a lot of picnic spots that are certainly worth stopping for! You won't regret it"

Hout Bay is as typical as any other fishing bay/village in the world. 20 minutes from CBD.Most famous for its fish & chips, world of birds sanctuary, arts & crafts market , boat trips to Seal Island & shipwrick & not to mention the most eco friendly beaches and surrounds. But what makes it different is the most picturous views coming into and going out the bay. Mounted between Chapmans Peak and Sentinel Hill. The bay and beaches are best viewed from Chapmans Peak side. Easily accessible from CBD and Constantia side of the Cape Peninsula via car & bus. Toll fees applies for car & bus access to Chapmans Peak only. Alternatively access views from the Mosque on the Hill & mingle with locals. Take a walk on the jetty & see some locals managing \"un-trained\" seals or buy some fresh fish caught in resident coastal waters from local fisherman. A highly reccommended item for tasting some of the best fish the Cape has to offer. Best visited during hot summer months using the sight seeing hop on hop off bus sight seeing tour bus from the V & A Waterfront."

The journey takes approx 40 minutes round trip and our boat wasn't overly crowded so plenty of space to take photos. The seals were great. I would recommend taking a windproof jacket as Hout Bay can get chilly due to the wind.We didn't, but you could get here by using the red hop on hop off bus company from Capetown."

It can also be done in conjunction with chapmans peak drive. There are a few take aways as well as a restaurant. I recommend the fish and chips however. Nice and fresh as the fishing boats are based in hout bay. There are also a few shops for curios and jewellery etc.Not the cheapest but no more than at the V & A. It is also a nice idea to walk down the pier and look at the fishing boats as well as the lovely view. There is a guy who feeds the seals and for a minimal amount will let you take photos with the seals. These are not captive seals they are wild so it does make for a lovely photo. A great place to visit"

Though the place is lovely and the boat ride to the seal colony is quite mesmerizing with the lovely scenery of mountains and water, but the seal colony is quite over-rated. You will find thousands of black seals on a big rock but it is nothing spectacular or wowing (especially since you can find huge game in South Africa and even stuff like Dolphins / Whales etc. in the bay). Given it is very cheap, you should definitely do it, but do not expect that you will be blown away by the experience. There is a local market just next to the boat ticket place where you can get good souvenirs for cheap prices (Negotiate a lot, those people often reduce prices to even 30-40% of what they originally say).The boats are at 20 minutes interval each as there are 3 boat companies each of which has a boat ride at interval of hour. So if you arrive in between, you might have to wait 10-15 minutes."

Firstly if you drive up from Cape Town and around the back of Table Mountain you drive past Camps Bay and the Twelve Apostles and then closer to Hout Bay you pass the picturesque town of Llandudno. (Currently there are road works along the way but these do not spoil your enjoyment). The other route is to drive from Noordhoek to Hout Bay via Chapmans Peak - on a nice day this is a spectacular drive (although you will pay a road toll for the experience). Once you drive into Hout Bay head for the Harbour, Fishermans Wharf and the beach on the bay. The Harbour is a quaint place to visit and we were lucky enough to see two Sea Lions playing in the Harbour. The stroll along the beach is also pleasant on a nice day. Fishermans Wharf has some nice shops to browse and look for small gifts for friends and family and some nice restaurants where you can eat. We ate at the upstairs Fisherman's Wharf, sat outside listening to some buskers playing jazz - an altogether delightful way to spend a Sunday afternoon.It is well worth the visit to see the other side of the coast."

They also serve other combos such as, snoek, calamari and chips, etc. Whenever we holiday in Cape Town, we automatically turn towards Hout Bay and visit Snookies. There are other restaurants and take-aways in the area but his one is my favourite. This business started in the early 1950's, where fish and chips were prepared and sold from a mobile vehicle. They catered for the people that worked in and around Hout Bay. Today the business has grown to cater for tourists as well. The restaurant is simple, with wooden tables and benches that can be cleaned quickly and easily. Large windows allows one to enjoy the working surroundings, boats, birds, etc. On my departure, I usually buy take-aways to give to family and friends. If you see someone with a large cooler box, bound for Durban, at the airport - that's me."

A little detour might bring you to the tiny villige of Llandudno with its beautiful beach. Hout Bay is situated around a perfect crescent shaped bay and beach. Surrounded by mountains where the forest atmosphere makes you feel in a totally different area. And another beautiful short drive away from Constantia, heart of the Cape Town winelands."

DONT LET THIS DETER YOU! We had the famous Lamb Man ciabatta buns. So yummy. Slow cooked leg of lamb with mint jelly, salad (if you want) and gravy saturated in the bun. The dim sum opposite the lamb man is also yummy. Heaps of varieties. There are cakes, sugar free, gluten free and they are delicious also. All in all it is a great day out.

The market in the harbour is great offering a wide array of crafts and also food stalls where you can try some delicious African specialties and gourmet food, at the other side of the bay, the beach is a beautiful crescent shape with numerous people paddle boarding and kayaking in the sheltered bay. On the other hand there hoards of dog walkers who don;t pick up their dogs mess so you have to watch where you walk on the beach which has you looking at the sand all the time. not the beautiful views. We were lucky enough to witness a pod of dolphins enter the bay during our visit and watch them play in the waters. At the end of Hout Bay is Chapmans Peak Drive which is a beautiful coastal road that is well worth the small toll for the spectacular views. It takes you to Norkhoek which has the most spectacular super-wide sandy beach."

The fact is that you can do this on your own and add some spectacular views of the ocean. Many boats offer to take you to seal islands for about 7 dollars per person. Along the dock, some of the seals have been trained by locals to jump out of the water and take a piece of fish from the locals' mouth. This might not be something you want to try by yourself but it is quite fun to watch. The road (toll but cheap) brings you to the Cape of Good Hope. Spectacular spot with ostriches and sea birds on the way."

An old fish warehouse (no it doesn't smell) is opened up with more than a 100 booths adorned with arts, crafts, merchandise.. Found some beautiful hand crafted bowls for my home, gorgeous jewelry, sunglasses, clothing.. All for under a few hundred. And when you get tired of shopping, then you can do lots of people watching.  We went to Hout Bay twice. The second time, we walked along the pier with old beautiful boats, saw men feeding seals (literally putting fish in their mouth's and seals would jump out of the water and grab the fish.), We walked along a beautiful beach with panoramic views and ended up having a lovely little lunch at Dunes Beach restaurant. Great day!"

You must try the fish once there - Mariners Wharf is a hit, and sit on the beach outside the restaurant after for a relaxed day. It is a very calm beach so its pleasant. Round the corner from there is a craft market where you can find items for dirt cheap - like under R20 even! Also, the hop-on hop-off gets off right here so its super convenient :)"

Local children and families were splashing in the sea and tourists were queuing for tables at the restaurants, most of which serve freshly caught fish and seafood. It's a jolly little place. Much more down-to-earth and ramshackle than its snootier Camps Bay neighbour. Worth a stop off if you're on the mini blue peninsula tour bus."

Snoekies and Mariners are the famous places, but they just serve fried calamari and prawns and you can do well to stay away, unless you are desperate to fill your stomach.There are some great places to drink and eat away from the harbour. This is where you go for a gourmet meal. The harbour is a working harbour and its worth going around there between 4 and 6pm to see the fishermen bring in in their catch.There are also seals in the bay, and a local beggar does shows where he feeds the seals and allows you to also feed the seals.Its entertaining and very real."

Wonderful views and a nice beach to walk along a couple of times a day but the amount of dog poop on the sand and absolutely no effort on the part of dog owners to pick it up is disappointing. The sea is freezing so not much use for kids. Some nice restaurants in the town and the working fishing port is nice to stroll around even if it is rather run down. We did the sea fishing which was a bit of a dead loss and very expensive. Not an awful lot to do, but we managed a bunch of day trips away from the place for interest. As other have said, almost all of the beaches around are better. Great fish and chips at Salties."

In the town area there are numerous little places to eat, and at the harbour there are also various eating places. If one drives right to the end of the road there is Snoekies and On the Rocks, which are both very popular and serve really super fish and chips.

I wanted to go to seal island on the glass bottomed boat but the boat was in for servicing and the few shops there were very lacklustre and sold the usual tourist tat. The beach was accessible but it had been a showery day and it was not somewhere you would want to stay and relax.

Hout Bay should be experienced by boat, get on a ferry or book a sunset cruse from Hout Bay via seal island, Llandudno, (Sandy Bay), Clifton to the V&A. The boats take you past seal island, beware of the smell...

The journey along the coast on the 108 via Camps Bay takes about three quarters of an hour and costs less than 10 rand. The 109 bus only goes into Hout town not the fish docks, so if you catch this you will have to change to the 108 at some point. Sunday's are busy with lots of people going down there for Sunday lunch. I had a pint of Prawns, my wife Moules Marinier, both excellent value for money. You can take a boat trip from here to seal Island and view Adams peak. Take a walk around the docks and watch the seals at play, one was tossing a large fish around before deciding to eat it. A couple of local guys were feeding the seals fish and for a small fee would show you how agile these creatures are when there is a free feed available, reaching almost full length out of the water for a scrap of fish."

For my next visit I'd like to sample the smoked salmon and the crayfish. The broad selection of available food would satisfy the most demanding palate. My daughter loves the nachos which did look very moreish, and the fresh coffee also looked very tempting. The market is under cover which is a huge bonus for the Cape weather and is open on Friday nights and Saturdays and Sundays. I liked the fact that there was room to walk and browse and ample parking. Biscuit Mill by comparison is always a long walk from wherever one finds parking"

But in general, in my opinion, it was nothing super amazing so if you are short on time you could skip this activity, but once again the price is too cheap to pass up as it is still a neat experience. If you get motion sick you may want to take something just before as the combination of the rocking boat (depending on waters) and stink seal crap may turn your stomach.At the pier where all the seal tours depart there will be a bunch of vendors selling neat African souvenirs. I found that the prices here were the most reasonable when compared to anywhere else I had been on my South African tour, so if you're needing gifts buy them here! Then, if you can, take the drive up Chapman's Pass to get a stunning view of the bay. There is a great lookout point to snap some great photos!"

You can get some great fish and chips and some good shopping with quality African craft wares available. If you are looking to buy some fresh fish this is the place also, with fishing boats bringing fresh fish straight to the Bay Fish shop. A really charming place with a relaxing vibe."

In the harbor there is a man who, if you buy him some sardines, can feed some seals and let them do tricks. He is easy to recognize since he looks like a pirate. There is also a marketplace for handcraft."

A must try when you are in cape town, the queue can be long so don't go midday during the holidays when you are starving ( up to 1 hour+ wait).on the other side of the seaboard is Kalk Bay which serve the next best Fish and Chips in Cape Town, so when you are going to or from Simon's Town and passing Kalk Bay, Stop at the fish and Chips shop there, there are two, go to the one that is close to the entrance and closest to where the fishing boats unload There will be a lady there that screams out the orders. You won't regret having some of the best fish and chips ever.2. Seal Island. There are hourly cruises to seal island which takes you close to the seals, there are some others tours around that you can do but this is the most popular one. 3. World of birds, in Hout Bay but not close to the sea. A awesome place if you want to see a range of wild birds and even spend some personal time with some monkeys. 4. The Beach , cold water, not the ideal for swimming or sun bathing but okay to walk and wonder about.5. The Hout Bay shops for local foods/curios6. If you fancy some live lobster that you might want to take back to your place and create your own fusion, drop me an email and I will let you know where to go to get 2kg of live lobsters from a factory in the area. Legal. Tax invoice and all. It will cost about R500 (rand) for 2kg which equates to about 8-10 lobsters in a box. You can buy one cooked lobster at fisherman's wharf for R160 so it is a no brainer not to buy fresh live lobsters unless you don\u2019t know how to cook it. I don't check my tripadvisor email that often, so if you don't hear from me don't despair or try emailing me at devtcomm @ yahoo . com"

To me it is a cross between Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco and a down to earth working port. Some parts are looking like they could do with a makeover. There are numerous trips you can go on like catching a boat to Dulker Island and see the seals. I liked just wandering around and taking photos as it is that kind of place. There are numerous souvenir stalls along the front and an ATM in the middle next to a snack bar. I think a day is plenty unless using it as a base for exploring further afield."

Our tour guide stopped at the wharf so we could go on a boat trip in the bay to view seals.Fortunately, we were a few minutes late for the first boat that was about to leave - it was packed to the rafters with tour groups. The next boat along the wharf was not booked out and so we had no trouble getting a seat on the upper deck.While waiting for it to depart, we took photos of a seal being fed by a man sitting on the wharf near the boat. This was nothing compared with what we would see later. The boat sailed out of the bay to a group of rocks where there were dozens of seals sunning themselves on the rocks and swimming in the water nearby.It seemed as though the various boats were timed to allow one boat at a time. Our boat pulled up very close the rocks in the surging waves and winds to allow us to take as many photos as we liked.We were there for about 15 minutes before the next boat arrived. Because there weren't many other passengers, we were able to move around during that time to get the best shots - hanging onto railings as we went to make sure we stayed on board rather than joining the seals in the water. The whole expedition took almost an hour.It was a beautiful sunny day and so we were able to enjoy the fabulous views of the bay and the coastline as well as the seal viewing. It is beautiful setting.There was plenty of activity at the wharf including entertainers who welcomed each returning boat."

On a clear day the wind is brisk, sun wonderfully warm and you will see numerous sun bathing and swimming seals. You will hear them as well as smell them! On occasion, I have heard you might even witness a shark feasting on these unlucky bathers. I saw no such thing, anyhow it is a nice outing for terrific snapshots and video. The little village has an ample assortment of souveniers at reasonable prices and eating establishments that are quite good. Easy to find a cold drink and relax here.

Admittedly, it was not a very nice day - a little overcast and rainy. The cost is about 5 USD. The boat takes about 5-10 minutes in each direction (you don't leave the boat), but if the weather is not perfect, it passes through some very rough water. Rough water = seasickness. I am not prone to seasickness, but this boat trip did make me sick (and others as well). I think the guide, if not the boat operator, should have been more cognizant of the water conditions before sending us off. Leaving a rocky boat and then travelling in a van on a bumpy, winding road caused me to spend the next 4 hours in major discomfort.If the weather is good and you never get to see seals, it may be worth the trip - I wouldn't go otherwise."

It is a delightful little place, and has a very good little shopping mall with an excellent woolworths (same as UK M&S) and other small shops including a homeopathic store and pharmacy. The harbour offers lots of interest too, with regular boat trips out to sea. The locals are friendly and there are two excellent markets a week. One craft market on the green on sundays which is a delight, and the bay harbour enclosed market which offers a wealth of foodie delights and some colourful if not slightly overpriced stalls. But all in all Hout bay is a must. Would definately prefer to stay there than in central capetown but you have to have a car!!!"

If you travel via Chapmans Peak from Kommetjie and Noordhoek, then you are in for a treat...but there is a toll fee. Coming from Camps Bay, you will have awesome sea views...stop at the lookout over Llandudno at sunset for a special view.A walk along the Hout Bay beach on a nice day is always worth it and this can lead you straight to the harbour attractions if you wish. Should you prefer to join the locals rather, then coffee (and breakfast if you are hungry) at Darios on Victoria Rd is the way to go.A lazy lunch or dinner at Dunes on the beach is rewarding on a beautiful day and many foreign tourists do this very thing. An Italian restaurant, called Luigis, frequented by the locals is very popular. One drawback? Getting behind a heavy truck or overladen taxi going up Constantia Nek! Takes forever at 20 kms an hour. Also, cockroach taxis (Toyota Conquest etc...) stopping wherever they like, holding up traffic and making a nuisance of themselves. A bit more thought for fellow road users would be in order."

The actual harbor view is also nice and you can see some seals even without going on the boats. There are lots of stalls of african handicrafts and it was a great place for me to get photos without feeling too pressured by the sellers. I think most people go there for the seal boat trips, and not sure what else there is to do there, but definitely stop to enjoy the views OF the bay from the road on your way in/out."

Worthwhile to visit the harbour, try the smoked snoek, or eat at one of the restaurants.Hout Bay itself is a small sleepy village, filled with restaurants serving all types of food. Worth a drive Of course from there one can continue to Chapmans Peak and Cape Point."

Chapman\u2019s Peak Drive which overlooks the Sentinel Mountain across the bay is my favourite .I had a privlidge of watching a whale from here .There are many pleasure boats operating in the Hout Bay harbour for trips to the seal island and ship wreck .Tried quite hard looking for sharks on my trip but did not see any. Snoekis is my favourite resturant"

Hout Bay is still a great place to see the wonderful beach at Nordhoek, and to explore the Constantia winelands. A wonderful surprise was had at the World of Birds, reached by the Red Bus trip from Cape Town. Well worth a visit, for the birds, and for the monkeys :-)"

It's by no means a slum, but after the sterile environment of Cape Town, you are faced with stray dogs, unusual smells, boat fuel and market stalls. We went for the seal spotting, so grabbed a boat out of the harbour. I love a boat trip anyway, so it was nice to get out in to the sea breeze and across to the seal island, where we bobbed about for a bit while we all took pictures and tried to ignore the horrific fishy-seal-poo smell! Well, what do you expect?!"

The beach is white sand and popular with dog walkers. Take a boat trip to seal island a round trip of about 45 minutes. Visit the indoor market, open at weekends, at the end of the wharf. The Sunday market on the green is well worth a visit for gifts."

The boat certainly gets good,close views of the seals and turns around so both sides could see the cuties. We also took a ton of shots of the dramatic cliffs, clouds, and amazing water colors. The trip was well worth the small fee for the boat.

Hout Bay has the very touristy Mariners Wharf and a long pier at one end, along with a few shops and several boating berths, offering tourists trips out to Seal Island. At the far end of the bay it seemed much more functional, with fishing boats aplenty and a more industrial feel. The Bay is beautiful \u2013 even on a bad day when the mist was hanging low, I got some nice views of the steep hills around the bay, although I do feel that I missed out, as the clouds were very low when I visited.  Snoukies Fish and Chips is real highlight and is worth a trip to the far end of the bay - this place is a real gem - the best fish and chips! Hout Bay is a nice destination just a short trip out of Cape Town."

Hout Bay is a working fishing village which is unpretentious and can be quite busy.The beach is quite nice but as with all SA beaches - very cold!! Obviously it gets pretty windy here as there is sand everywhere, on every street, in every corner.Fish and Chips at the Mariners Wharf are a must - and they really live up to their reputation. It was cold on the day we visited, so we had lunch in the restaurant upstairs and the food was truly superb. It was quite a surprise as we were expecting the usual tourist standard fare. It was really the best fish and chips I have ever had (and with teenage kids tagging round with us, we have tried a lot!)It's worth a walk along the marina to see the fishing trawlers and lobster boats. There are seals everywhere and plenty of locals touting for cash to buy fish for them. The local market was interesting, and there are plenty of options if you want to go for a boat ride to see seals.For surfers, the point at Hout Vay is also know as Dungeons and this surf spot can pull a decent 40-50 foot wave when its working. Its a pretty impressice sight.Definitely worth a visit, HOut Bay is a good place to stop for lunch on your way to the Cape."

From the minute we got to Hout Bay we loved every moment with the stunning mountains and beaches. Mariners wharf was very nice with a couple of boats that did tours to 'seal island' and 'chapmans peak'. I especially loved the 'chapmans peak toll route' between Noordhoek and Hout Bay. You get the most awesome views. Also Hout Bay had gorgeous beaches with lovely sand dunes to explore. It was a lovely place to unwind and to get away from the city."

The beach is not as beautiful as some of the other beaches in Cape Town, but the bay itself is stunning, and from most places in Hout Bay the views are spectacular. There are many restaurants and bars, but it's not as touristy as Camps Bay. Chapmans Peak drive, overlooking Hout Bay, is probably one of the most scenic drives in the world. Hout bay has loads of character, being famous for its fish and chips, and more recently the vibrant new harbour market."

Mariner's Wharf at the harbour offers the best snoek, calamari and chips in Cape Town! Beautiful inland or coastal drive to get to Hout Bay.Dislike: Hout Bay can get incredibly busy during peak periods and school holidays. can also get sometimes very windy."

The vibe is interesting, the beach is wide and long, cruises can be enjoyed from this point and you can eat with great sea views. It's a multi-cultural town and the craft market on Sundays offers mainly African crafts. The swimming is safe, so it's great for families. There is not much else in Hout Bay but the beach and harbour (and World of Birds) are worth a visit."

Really beautiful coastline, cliffs, sea... but all white, with a Black township where workers live in appalling conditions on the outskirts. Although almost 2 decades after Nelson Mandela was freed and democratic elections held, the segregation by race and class pervades the South African culture, and destroys (for me) the natural beauty of the coast. The harbour is nice, fish and chips restaurant tasty, with seals/sea lions playing along the docks. It is a nice place to visit, but I just couldn't get past the segregated lives separating rich/poor and Black/white communities. To get there, most whites rent a car and drive from Cape Town. Most Blacks and Brown families take a bus from the central bus station by the Grand Parade downtown Cape Town. The bus goes along the coast, passing very pretty coastline and beach communities, again, exclusively white. Once in Hout Bay, there is a Brown township up the hill overlooking the town, separate from the Black township. You should check out all three areas and see for yourself the \"new South Africa.\""

The Seal Island ferry boat trip was nice and not expensive. The white sandy beaches were also great, although the water was too cold for swimming. We also liked strolling around a bit around the marina area. The most enjoyable part of our stop was simply eating fresh calamari at the kiosk stands, picnic style on the little wooden tables. This was just great, making a highly memorable stop in Hout Bay. Hout Bay can be best visited by CitySightSeeing Bus Tour (Blue Line) or as part of a Cape Peninsula day trip, where you'll probably stop here for 45 minutes to 1 hour to see the seals. Either way, Hout Bay is a very enjoyable place to spend an hour or more.We definitely recommend finding a way to fit Hout Bay into your Cape Town trip."

It's just too bad Chapman's Peak drive isn't open. Hout Bay is very accessable by car, taxi or the hop on hop off bus. Seacliffe Lodge looks on to the wharf and is the best central location. The service we received from the owners was second to none."

For starters the natural surroundings are spectacular with the beautiful moutains and sea. The beach was a lovely place to be especially during the evenings when everybody seemed to be having a great time. There are numerous restaurants and cafes to eat in nearly all with a great view of the bay, you will be spoilt for choice. We felt very safe there and had no problem walking around on our own, even in the evenings. It's a great place to stay if you are a keen photographer as you will get great sunset shots especially from the Chapman's Peak side of the bay, but the views are great anytime and anywhere. The seal island cruise is definately worth doing, you will see thousands. We will definately go back, it's a very special place."
