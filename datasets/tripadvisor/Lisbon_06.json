Go straight from the airport, taxi, tuk-tuk, public transportation ,car or walking. Whether you only have a few hours, days, or weeks this is a hidden gem...Early, mid late afternoon- each time of the day is perfect- shady or sunny, tables, excellent service only surpassed by the ever changing views..Loved it so much we re-arranged our schedule to see the sunset every night we were there."

Numerous restaurants, cafes and bars are within close proximity including several that share similar views as the mirador. Be prepared for crowds, especially in the evening."

The blue sky, the terracotta buildings, the shady benches, the grand old trees, the artisan lemonade, the tasty crepes, guitar music...a place to gaze, a place to read, a place to allow you breath to be taken away. So here is how I suggest you leave. Walk downhill past the noisy tuk-tuks queueing to arrive and then turn right into the larger road following the tram lines. Walk a couple of hundred yards and then turn left downhill when you see the river, again following the tram lines. Narrow streets, down, down you go, past all the crooked old houses, there are cafes and small restaurants serving grilled food, down towards Alfama where there are even more restaurants, bars and wine bars. And you are then by the Rio Tejo. About 45 minutes in total, downhill momentum and curiosity will make it seem like no time at all!"

Offering a view slightly higher than the Gra\u00e7a (and accessible through some stairways in the Gra\u00e7a district), on a clear day you can see Lisbon from the Castle S\u00e3o Jorge on your left down to the Belem Tower on your right.

Here you can have the most impressive view of this entire historical city (besides the Castelo de S\u00e3o Jorge which is located very close to this Miradouro). Surrounding the overlook there is an area covered in grass where, if interested, you can climb over the fence and settle, and just indulge in this picturesque sight in front your eyes. Especially during sunset. It's fascinating. You won't regret it.It could be a little complicated to reach the Miradouro on foot for people who are not too familiar with the neighborhood. I would recommend taking the yellow tram (El\u00e9trico) or No.734 at the bus stop near the Martim Moniz square. Beware of pickpockets because there're lots of them. Then get off at the stop Rua da Gra\u00e7a (near the Restaurante A Tasca do Jaime). Go straight along Rua da senhora do Monte, the street that slopes up to the Miradouro."

My problem is, there's not much in the surrounding area, you have to make a hike up there and then you find out there's really nothing but a similar view as other viewpoints in Lisbon .... it was pretty disappointing to me.

The now pervasive tuk-tuks stop there and have made it a major attraction. Regardless of this, it is still definitely worth a visit, as it has one of the best, if not the very best view from a public spot in and from Lisbon. Magic at sunrise or sunset in a warm day. No food or drinks there, go to the nearby Miradouro da Gra\u00e7a for that (a bit lesser view, yet still great)."

It seems that this miradouro is a bit out of the way, high up above Alfama, its quieter, and seems to have less tourists than other sites. The views are breathtaking! In the evening, you could pack a bit of a picnic with a bottle of wine and enjoy the sights and sounds of the town below while enjoying the evening. Once in a while, a tuktuk car will bring along a bunch of tourists, but they are there for about 20 mins before they move on to explore other parts of the beautiful Lisbon. Overall, this is a very nice spot for picture taking, both day and evening. We took pictures with our iPhones, but if you are fortunate enough to have one of those serious big cameras, they will find their calling here :) ."

When you sit down they serve bread, cheese, sometimes olives etc. These are not free & if you eat them you will have to pay for them.

You practically look over the whole of downtown Lisbon, the Tagus and the iconic Ponte 25 de Abril from here. It also has the most relaxing ambiance as it is less crowded compared to Miradouro da Santa Luzia and Portas do Sol that you will pass along the way. You can reach the miradouro by taking the famous Tram 28, it's worth the long and uncomfortable tram ride!"

You can get a number 28 tram to a stop about 400m away and then navigate some side roads to find it.The views are stunning. You can see right across Lisbon, over the river to Christo Re and the Pont 25 Abril as well as lots of other places in the city. The small shrine is also very pretty.If you want to walk back down to central Lisbon, there are some steps to the side, but beware they are very steep at the top and very narrow so not good to go down if you have a pushchair or similar."

There is a very small church too.There is no space for a coffee shop or any other kind of shop, which makes this spot cosy. It's an important spot to me since it was here that me and my wife started to date.It's a very nice place at night with all the city lights but it gets windy so take a coat.There is no parking lot, it's very difficult to park since it's a residential area."

On the other side of the hill we could see the Miradouro de S\u00e3o Pedro de Alcantara and the Convento do Carmo.
