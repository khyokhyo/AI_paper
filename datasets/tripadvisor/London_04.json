The clocks are mostly, if not all, French and fine examples. Porcelain abounds at every turn and there is a super collection of Majolica. Being just north of Oxford street it is a step away from frenetic shopping and offers a peaceful and educational respite! There is a good restaurant too."

The guides are friendly, well informed and happy to answer questions. Well worth a visit.....even if you don't think you like art galleries, give it a try, you will love this one.Tip: The cafe is overpriced - very small helpings - take a short walk to a nearby restaurant for lunch and then go back for afternoon tea.....even then, you will get 4 tiny sandwiches and a small scone. Guess they have to make money somehow."

I returned having felt that I didn't take everything in the first time I visited.The armory section is so special with lots to see and an abundance of swords and shields amongst other things. Considering the specialty of some of the pieces and paintings its not a busy museum, perhaps it isn't advertised enough which is a shame.The restaurant can be popular with queuing sometimes, prices are expensive, there are many other eateries in the area."

The art is particularly good and the armoury very beautiful. The restuatrant in the central atrium is quite expensive for the dainty portions offered (definitely a ladies who lunch venue) but the menu was interesting and very tasty (as was the sauvignon blanc). I had the salmon quiche, which was delicious but my husband's crab and prawn salad was particularly small. A great place to spend a half day."

The ability to walk without crowds was great, but more important, it's the art that brings people in. So much great art collected in that building as well as ornate furniture and ceramics. The Laughing Cavalier and Girl on a Swing are the famous pieces, but there is so much more. The volume of great art was way beyond what I expected to see, and of such fine quality. There was a donation box and we gladly put in 5GBP. It was one of the nicest museums we visited while in London, and I think we saw most of them."

The Wallace Collection is a delightful small museum in quiet Manchester Square, London, just a 100 metre walk from the relentless shopping throngs and bustle of Oxford Street. It is the former townhouse of the Seymour family, Marquesses of Hertford; an immaculate 3 storey building.It is beautifully kept, with a collection of riches which reminds you of why you visit London. In 25 galleries there are displays of French 18th-century painting, beautifully preserved furniture and a brilliant armoury. Splendid works of the greats - Rembrandt, Canaletto (The Canaletto Room is one highlight among many), Van Dyck.It is a quiet, contemplative museum, made all the more memorable by being our first visit."

The Wallace Collection is lovely, especially if you like suits of armour, but the collection is huge and by the time I got to the painting galleries I think I was a little worn out by the, what appeared to be, largely un-curated collections on the way there. The rooms themselves are magnificent and I think that if you can avoid being bogged down in the armoury and actually just go for the specific paintings that you're looking for it would probably be better. My husband loves the suits of armour so we spent quite some time in the armoury meaning that the sheer volume of the place had weighed us down by the time we got to the paintings. It was also quite busy in the galleries and people didn't seem to heed gallery rules not to make a racket as they would in a traditional art gallery, perhaps because it's mixed. I recommend the guided tours as they looked very promising. We took tea in the courtyard restaurant which was nice."

            "review": "The Wallace Collection housed at Hertford House in Manchester Square, London.. My wife and I were due to have a dinner in Seymour Street but had a couple of hours to spare before. So I typed in \u201cAttractions near to Marble Arch\u201d and up came quite a list. One that caught my eye was The Wallace Collection, which for all I knew could have been about the writer Edgar Wallace. I really need to broaden my horizon of knowledge. So with no more ado we set off for London. After a quick stop at Hamilton Hall in Liverpool Street Station for a cappuccino for me and a chocolate with cream on the top for Lola, off we set for the Central Line Underground. Eight stops later and we got off at Marble Arch Underground station. As you exit the station turn to your LEFT. Cross over Portman Street, same again for Orchard Street, Selfridges the store is on your side of the road. Just past it is Duke Street, turn left into here and straight ahead you will come to Manchester Square. Hertford House is on the opposite side of the square. One great thing is that entrance is free; such magic words in to-days world. As you enter, their gift shop is on the left, most items I found to be on the high side price wise. There is an exit from here that takes you into rooms containing swords, helmets and rifles. Further around you can even see in the largest glass case a full size horse with a figure seated on it clad in a full suit of armour. Beware, you will need to spend a long time here in order to fully appreciate the collection that has been put together. However there is a place where you can purchase a complete meal or simply a drink. It would appear that money was not an option when this collection was first started. Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford originally started this in about 1897, who left both it and the house to his illegitimate son Sir Richard Wallace . His widow bequeathed the entire collection to the nation. However a condition of the bequest was that no object should ever leave the collection, not even for loan exhibitions. Should you like to view paintings, then this place has some really fine examples. There are two paintings by Titian, five Rembrandts, nine Rubenses, four Van Dycks, eight Canalettos, nineteen Bouchers, plus masterpieces by de Hooch, nine Teniers, Frans Hals, nine Murillos, two Vel\u00e1zquez and paintings by Domenichino, Cima, Daddi, Reni, Rosa, Thomas Gainsborough, Joshua Reynolds, Antoine Watteau, Nicholas Lancret, Jan Steen, Aelbert Cuyp and nine Guardis. On the top floor there is the great gallery. We entered from the left door, and there on our right was that well known portrait by Frans Hals. The name of the painter meant nothing to me before, but the moment you see his work of art you recognise it immediately; it is of course The Laughing Cavalier, painted about 1624. There is just so much to take in that we will have to return yet again to fully understand the breadth and importance of this collection. Lower floors down you will find displays of gold boxes, miniatures, sculpture and medieval and Renaissance works of art such as maiolica, glass, bronzes and Limoges enamels. What it doesn\u2019t let you know is how much fine furniture there is here as well. Some absolutely gorgeous pieces that simply take your breath away. One is a brilliant desk; and one can only guess at the kind of house this was used in and who was it that sat behind it? There are also some cabinets in a long shape that have small works in them. Puzzling though are that around the outside there are leather type covers which you have to lift up; do not miss these. Under each one, there may be for instance, a small miniature portrait that has to be protected from the light or to stop it from fading. Cabinets of maiolica porcelain full to the brim, just a delight as you take in more of this wide ranging collection. Could this collection be one of the most underated or unknown collections awaiting discovery? My narrow range does not give me the gift to fully describe just what a pleasure it was for us both to find this collection on the off chance, and for that we are so glad. If you have some time to spare do visit it, you will not be disappointed; and like us may return time and time again to see what new item you can find to take your breath away."

The house is a combination of a heritage home, a museum and an art gallery, giving you so much to take in.

It was easy to get a sense of why the art was in the collection and the individual tastes of the collectors was explained and then demonstrated. So, it's a great combination of a state owned museum but at a more personal level. Another benefit was that the museum was lightly attended. No crowded rooms. The art is exquisite. Also, there is a nice cafe in a covered courtyard where one can relax with a snack or lunch."

There are many paintings by great artists, an impressive collection of armour and dozens of superb porcelain and furniture pieces, and more! All of this is contained in a grand house and there is a very nice restaurant as well."

A 5 pound donation is recommended, and really seems like the least you can do given the quality of the collection and tour. Highly recommend the tour. It was intimate and extremely informative. The collection is just amazing. Really enjoyed the armor. We arrived just as it opened and went for breakfast. The courtyard (now covered) serves as the restaurant, and is a lovely space. Had some of the best Eggs Benedict and at an affordable price for London."

You must see the knight in armour on his war horse.The house itself is magnificent and beautifully looked after. The collection is just the right size and after walking around all the rooms there is a lovely cafe in the middle of the building to relax in. Years ago this was an open area but it has been glassed in and is a delightful place to have coffee. Entrance to this remarkable collection is free but after being treated to such benevolence it would be mean spirited not to make a donation."

Wandering around the richly decorated rooms you feel like you are in someones private home. I went just before lunchtime on a Thursday and the place was relatively quiet. On my first visit a couple of years ago I overheard one of the tour guides mention that Vivienne Westwood was a regular visitor to the Wallace, finding inspiration for her fashion collections. We were standing in front of the painting 'The Swing' an 18th-century oil painting by Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard. This place is a must visit for anyone who loves art and interiors. And its free! Highly recommend."

Several huge Canalettos, the so called Laughing Cavalier, and many more amazing pieces. The collection of Sevres porcelain is world class.

Thanks to the widow of it's last owner Sir Richard Wallace, we can now all enjoy their family collection for free(donation is welcomed and recommended) and marvel at their impressive collection of art created by some of the most well known grand masters such as Rembrandt, Rubens, Titian, and Velazquez.

To tell you the truth, we were there primarily for The Swing, Fragonard, but left mesmerized at the beauty of the location. This is not your ordinary whitecube, the building has a lot of personality, which I haven't seen in a while, being used to visiting modern art museums. It made us travel in time, revisiting a XVII-XVIII century Europe. The collection is most impressive and I wholeheartedly recommend it."

The Wallace Collection is one of the finest art collections in England, if not Europe, and the nation is incredibly indebted to Lady Wallace for her bequest. As a condition of the bequest was that no be allowed the leave the collection, this is the only place you can go to see some of the most famous paintings in the world, and so well worth a visit.The only downside is (as has been stated in quite a few other reviews) a small number of over-zealous members of staff. I have always wanted to see The Swing in the flesh, and so waited for quite a while whilst a lady took many close-up photos with her camera barely an inch from the canvas. After she left, I leaned towards the painting for a closer look (not nearly so close as the lady's camera lens had been), and the gentleman posted in the room bellowed across for me to get back. It seems the museum different policies for men than for buxom blondes in a low-cut tops!"

This is a simply wonderful art collection in a classic 19th century house on Manchester Square in Marylebone just north of Oxford Street and west of Regent Street. It has a pleasant restaurant in what used to be an outdoor courtyard (now covered), too. I'm not much for the porcelain, furniture, and armor. Instead, I concentrate on the paintings, which are exquisite. It's a top collection spanning the 14th - early 19th centuries probably surpassed only by the National Gallery. One feature I particularly appreciate is that in each room sets of small guidebooks explain the background and themes of each painting in the room. I spent a rainy afternoon in here recently to reacquaint myself with the collection. Enjoyed nearly three hours of reading the descriptions and taking in each painting. Emerged refreshed and peaceful.Pair a visit with a walk up Marylebone High Street (the extension of Thayer Street) and stop in a pub or cafe. Then, for the ambitious, a walk up through Regent's Park to Primrose Hill."

So, in essence the art you see here will never be seen anywhere else. The collection really is stunning, I guess the most famous painting here is the Laughing Cavalier by Hals this really is the tip of the icebrg. There are stunning pieces throughout. I was lucky enough to join the 2.30PM tour and I would highly recommend joining one of the tours. I do appreciate art but the curators here have an immense knowledge and their description of some selected plus the history and context are wonderful. It is also a lovely place to enjoy lunch. We dined in the courtyard restaurant which has a limited menu but nice food with a great ambience and good service. I believe that the restaurant offers a wider menu on a Friday and Saturday evening. One to try as you can dine under the stars in Central London.A great place to visit for the art lover."

The horse armour room has to be my favourite collection in London. It is enthralling for kids. The Peyton and Byrne caf\u00e9 has a decadent feel and the cakes are to die for. As a minimum it's possible to share an amazing salad and tasty fries, have an afternoon tea, or go the whole hog and indulge in some fine dining.

I remember being amazed then that I had never heard of it, having visited a great number of museums and galleries in the capital growing up. I don't think much has changed, with this wonderful museum maintaining its best hidden treasure in London reputation.The are endless treasures to discover, but our favourite rooms are the suits of armour for both men and horses and also 'Brizo, the Shepherd Dog' and the Landseer animal paintings, all on the ground floor. Then there is the plethora of French frou frous to be found on the 1st floor by Boucher, Fragonard and similar. However, there is so much more and they helpfully identify a different treasure within the collection each month; this has been going since 2003, so they've got quite a few.As well as the riches on display, the Wallace Collection also has a very lovely restaurant in the central courtyard of the building, providing the perfect London al fresco experience; trees, flowers... and a roof. The shop also deserves a mention, a good source of somewhat less naff than usual fine art related pressies."

So vast and spectacular is the arms and armor collection alone that I've yet to make it upstairs to the art galleries. Each time I go, I see something new and the visiting family members I drag along with me are impressed and more fascinated than they expected to be.It's open 7 days a week and costs nothing--add it to your must-see list!"

The collection is really amazing with Old Master paintings in every room. There is a whole room devoted to Canaletto and other Venetian artists. Gainsboroughs, Dutch painters and of course the iconic Laughing Cavalier (Franz Hals) Even if you don't know anything about art you will recognise many of the pictures as they are on posters, chocolate boxes, book jackets, etc. A very accessible and user friendly gallery for those who might find the National or Tate a bit overwhelming. And it is free! It is a place you could keep visiting as it has so many wonderful paintings."

It is made up of armour, furniture, ceramics, glass and paintings & miniatures. The collection is strong in French Rococo with works by Boucher and Frogonard. There are two rooms largely devoted to Venetian vedutes by Canaletto and Guardi. Their collection of Dutch works are very strong. The most important works are displayed in the Great Gallery including works by Rubens, Titian, Poussin and the painting most associated with the gallery, the Laughing Cavalier by Frans Hals.One condition of the bequest transferring the collection to the state was that no items could be loaned or sold. Despite this the museum does run temporary exhibitions with objects loaned from other museums.Entrance is free with donations accepted. There is a restaurant on site in the central courtyard."

Its like the Frick Collection in New York in that it is set in a grand private house only much more so as the collections here of art, furniture, armour and porcelain are huge. You follow the house through and see room after room stuffed with Rembrandts, Vermeers and countless other important artists ( I am really not doing it justice) , the beautiful furniture is like art in itself and the collections of porcelain are again amazing to look at and study the detail. Its all free and all belonged to one family who owned the house and gave it to the nation. Unlike other London Museums its not crowded.Finally there is a great cheap restaurant in the middle of the place that serves nice food. If you are mobility challenged this again is for you as its a good size to get around and has ramps and lifts to ensure you see everything an able bodied person does. Visit it as you won't regret it."

In real terms art prices are now at astronomic levels; during the period of over a century in which successive Marquesses of Hertford and Sir Richard and Lady Wallace were assembling this collection - or in reality series of different collections - they were more reasonable, but one still had to be seriously rich to build up even one of many different categories within this gallery: and it's free.Manchester Square is slightly off the beaten track, which may be why the collection receives fewer visitors than some less impressive museums and galleries, but it's within easy reach of Oxford Street (Bond Street underground) and Baker Street.Different areas house different collections. There was one point at which I felt slightly overwhelmed by the ornate French 18th century furniture, displayed with appropriate paintings, but then suddenly found myself in a room with an astonishing collection of Canalettos and other Venetian paintings. Then one suddenly sees a self-portrait of Rembrandt, looking across the room at a portrait of his son. Much copied paintings such as 'The Laughing Cavalier' (by Hals) live here.The collection of arms and armour is another collection that could justify an gallery of its own.I don't think it possible to absorb everything that is here in one visit. Having lived in London several times, and still visiting fairly frequently, I am wondering why it's been on my list for quite so long without my managing to visit, but I shall be back.There is also a cafe in the orangery (although some reviewers seem only to have noticed the cafe).A visit is highly recommended, but I also recommend being selective."

Paintings are beautiful from Rembrandt to titian then to the famous laughing cavalier. Restaurant in the middle serves great food. Basement allows the children to try on armour. Great place to go not just once as you'll miss things the first time around."

It is absolutely massive and free. Fragonard's \"swing\" is there as well as Boule's 17th and 18th century numerous cabinets. Basically, when the Bourbon had to leave France they sold their lots and there it is.... after a few memorable auctions. Magnificient.There are free tours. Just Turn up and wait in the front hall. The staff are lovely and very knowledgeable.The restaurant is great.It is 3 minutes walk from the famous departement store Selfriges.It is an oasis of culture in the West End"

The collection is the accumulation of five generations of one family sheltered in the historic residence of a marquis. Each generation added their own twist to their exquisite acquisitions. Italian and French Renaissance paintings. Masters. Armory. Porcelain. Snuff boxes with musicale masterpieces. Furniture. Silver. Decorative pieces. All tastefully displayed as a private collector might, in an opulent residence, now 25 galleries including one grand gallery that has just been refurbished.I have loved the Louvre, the Rijksmuseum, the National Galleries in the US and the UK, The Chicago Art Institute and the Detroit Institute of Arts. But this was my very favorite art experience. It was more up close and personal in a grand space. And it seemed largely low key and FREE. I almost hate to reveal its appeal for fear next time I visit it will be over run. It is the perfect place to visit on a rainy London day-- or any day. If I lived in London, I might visit a gallery a month, taking two years to consider the details of the collection and then begin again. The galleries were serene and uncrowded. Embraced by the rich decor, quiet visitors carefully consider the works Van Eyck, Rubens, Rembrandt, Titian and Hals-- just in ONE of the 25 galleries. Miniature scenes in unbelievable detail layered jeweled snuff boxes. Hard armory and silver shine reflected in gilded mirrors. The intimacy and perfection of the space was alluring, making a departure, especially onto the soggy streets, seem a ridiculous notion. We had hoped to have tea or lunch in the Wallace Collection's courtyard restaurant, but it was closed for filming of a television segmen. That will have to wait till next time."

For those museum goers who are into houses rather than large less personal spaces for the display of cherishable art, the Wallace Collection will be right up their alley. A rather large mansion nestled behind Manchester Square, this museum houses numerous paintings from the Dutch Old Masters including the famous Franz Hals Laughing Cavalier as well as Canaletto's many views of the Venetian canals from different perspectives. There are many 18th century French paintings as well. Those into home furnishings will delight in the Sevres porcelains, vases, mantlepiece sculptures and clocks. The basement has an impressive array of suits of armor and medieval weaponry. It is mind-boggling to thinks that these various items were collected by a single family. Well worth the visit and for those wishing an American frame of reference, think New York's Frick Museum."

The legacy imposed several restrictions on the works of art in the bequest: they could not leave the home, they could never be sold or loaned and they must be available to the public to enjoy. The museum is free, tours are offered throughout the day and there is a beautiful enclosed courtyard restaurant. We went early in the morning on a Saturday and it was not too crowed. We took the first tour available and it was very informative, covering the major works in all the rooms. This is a place we will go back to many times: the art collection is stunning in its historic sweep and here is so much to absorb it is best to take it in small chunks.

Amazing residence with wow factor entrance hall. Went straight to the conservatory restaurant which seemed to do excellent afternoon teas - huge scones and cakes looked amazing. Just had salad for lunch which was great and service immaculate and first class. Excellent guide book taking you around all rooms in a house refurbished to its old grandeur with such style . All the pictures and furniture are in excellent condition by all the old masters, and then came across the laughing cavalier, who knew it was there !!! There was a guider son in each room who knew where everything was and explained all we needed to know. 3 hours passed so fast with only a brief look at everything. Will definitely be back, a huge congrats to all who work there and those who sponsor its upkeep, no crowds so a place to go anytime"

It has a rich collection, especially of 18th-century French paintings (Watteau, Boucher, Fragonard), sculpture, furniture and porcelain---probably the best outside France. It's also known for its collection of arms and armour displayed in four rooms, plus a small but select group of 17th-century Dutch and Flemish paintings, including the most famous one in the collection: Frans Hals' humourous portrait \"The Laughing Cavalier,\" where the soldier seems to be giving the viewer \"the eye\"!The gallery is tucked away in small, quiet Manchester Square in an elegant district just two blocks north of Oxford Street and Selfridge's Department store. It's the former home of a 19th-century politician and art collector, and the art objects are displayed much as they would have been when he lived there.The thing I like about this museum is that it's quiet, not overly crowded, and has only 24 manageable-sized rooms, so you can take your time. There's a beautiful sweeping staircase greeting you in the entrance hall, plus a good (though pricey) French-themed cafe/restaurant in the glass-covered courtyard. Also, there's a well-stocked gift shop to the left of the entrance where you can buy mini replicas of some of the pretty French snuff-boxes, jewellery boxes and china that you saw in the gallery spaces.A tip: make sure you're there when the hour changes, as a lot of the 18th-century clocks in the rooms announce the new hour with tinkling chimes!"

Prior to our visit to the Wallace Collection I have never heard of it, I would have to say that it is my favourite small museum in London and if ever we return to London it would be on my list to revisit.The Wallace Collection is located in Hertford House in Manchester Square, it is a free national musuem; open everyday expect over Christmas from 10am to 5pm. On the afternoon of our visit we joined a free guided tour lead by Nini who was very excited to be showing our group of 18-20 around, Nini wanted us to get the most of our her tour and our visit to the house, and that's exactly what we did over the next hour and twenty minutes. The collection is astounding, incredibly valuable and full of exquisite 18th century French artwork and objects. At the time of our visit there was a temporary exhibition of porcelain from Jean-Claude Duplessis from Serves, stunning craftsmanship.There are also paintings by Gainsborough, Rembrandt, Titan, Velazquez, Murillos, Frans Hals to name just a few to seek out. On the ground floor there is an extensive collection of arms and armour which is also well worth a visit. Overall visiting the Wallace Collection was a wonderful experience, a small and intimate museum with dedicated staff with very small crowds, and I very much look forward to revisiting."

The Collection is primarily 17th and 18th century Baroque and Rococo though it includes works by Dutch Masters too. This was stuff I normally would have little interest in. Yet the docent\u2019s insights in a 1\u00bd hour tour brought it alive. Bronze/turtle shell marquetry used in the period furniture was explained. In addition to furniture and paintings, the Collection houses the finest examples of European armor around. Who knew that armor imitates the clothing style of the period (makes it easy to date). Then there are the decorative arts displays, again one of the best collections to be seen in one place. Apparently that is the primary draw for this little museum. Each piece is more exquisite than the next. This was one of the most enjoyable museum visits ever for me (and we\u2019ve been to plenty).

My friend and I made our way to Manchester Square, Wigmore Street, behind Selfridges, and were just in time to join a guided tour. We began in the Billiard Room of this magnificent mansion, Hertford House, where we learned about the skillful technique of Boulle marquetry with an exquisite cabinet and desk. This fine craft is named after its inventor, Andr\u00e9 Charles Boulle (1742-1732), who perfected the technique of inlaying brass and tortoiseshell in wood.The Back State Room is home to a fabulous collection of dramatic S\u00e8vres porcelain, particularly the work of one Jean-Claude Duplessis (1699-1774), a goldsmith and sculptor who designed gilt-bronze mounts and vase models of unprecedented technical and stylistic skill for twenty-five years. He took his inspiration from a variety of bizarre sources, including elephant trunks and royal table ornaments, to create the most beautiful and exuberant Rococo porcelain. (I would rather say Baroque, as it is too heavy and ornate for the Rococo style.) I particularly liked the pot-pourri vase in the shape of a ship, designed to dispel the human odours of the day, and the inkstand made for a princess, complete with a little bell with which to summon her maid.Organic shapes taken from nature, the principal source of the Rococo artists, manifest not only in the pieces displayed in great glass cases, but the fabulous chandelier which graces this room. A Louis XV chest of drawers has no straight lines; the designs are curled, like leaves, curved and sinuous, and decorated with gold.Forty percent of the Collection is arms and armoury, and the ornate Tudor armour on display are all works of art; it is sculpture, designed to make the wearers look larger than life, and more magnificent. Lord Sackville\u2019s \u201cGarniture of the field\u201d has interchangeable pieces, and a rare 15th century Gothic German exhibit includes plate and chainmail armour for the knight\u2019s horse as well as for the knight.The Large Gallery, the walls of which are covered with beautiful crimson silk, displays a collection of paintings which represents a \u201cdialogue\u201d between the great European masters - teachers and their pupils: Rubens, Rembrandt, Titian, Velasquez, Frans Hals, Van Dyck and Poussin. A highlight for me was Poussin\u2019s A Dance to the Music of Time (1634-6), which depicts Jupiter\u2019s gift to the world: wine. The four Seasons, and Saturn and Apollo, the gods of Time, dance to the music of Time\u2019s lyre. It is a representation of the cycle of the human condition: day and night, life and death, and conveys a deep philosophical message.Three Dutch Galleries, lined in royal blue silk, display works by Rembrandt and his contemporaries. The d\u00e9nouement, my favourite picture in all of London, hangs in the Oval Drawing Room: Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s The Swing (1767), displaying all the gloriously carefree and unbridled joie de vivre of the French Rococo."

As you explore the collection of art, sculpture and the decorative arts ( which is amazing) you'll find the pieces you've seen in art history books, you'll discover new favorites by known artisst and you'll discover new favorites. The experience of roaming a home where art was displayed among wonderful pieces of furniture truly takes you back. There is excellent signage so you can come to an understanding of just who might have worn that armour. There were no crowds when we arrived at opening, and the lunch on the enclosed pation was relaxing as well as delicious."

The great news is that, unlike most well known art galleries/museums, there are so few people who know of the Wallace so you can actually SEE and appreciate the exhibits without crowds of unappreciative and bemused tourists seeing what they think they ought to see rather than because they want to see it and thus getting in the way. What a joy it is to wander round quietly with unrestricted views. I remember when most European museums and art galleries were like this, but that is no longer in this age of mass tourism, so make the most of the Wallace before it gets 'discovered' as it deservedly should be.The large hall on the first floor is the best of what is already very good. It is a concentrated cornucopia of excellent European art mostly for the 16th and 17th century. They do not have everything, but almost one of every kind of genre. The lighting is excellent and the pictures hung so well for viewing; a very model of how an art gallery should display.It is not just the pictures either: the furniture and general decor is so tasteful and right and dare I say it, opulent. Then they have some very good porcelain, not a lot, but what is there is good and again beautifully displayed.And what about the enamelled miniatures!There is even a good collection of armour and so beautifully displayed and like everything else well curated to educate.The staff seem to be largely volunteers, well informed and knowledgeable, another welcome feature.There is even a nice cafeteria and a small but good shop.It is free! It ought not to be because it is so worth paying for, so give a good donation when you leave. It deserves one."

The Wallace Collection - house, art, and furniture - was willed to the people of Britain by the 5th Marquisse of Hertford. At one point the family was among the wealthiest in Europe and this is evident in the brilliant collections of paintings, silver, armour and porcelain. Housed in what was once the family home, the collection is quietly looked after by some of the most knEowledgeable docents familiar with location of pieces and the history of the family and their works of art. Rembrandts, Hals, and much more! Each room is a work of art in itself. Admission is free of charge. The Wallace Collection house is located opposite a quiet little private park just a block behind Selfridges. It is worth repeat visits and there is so much to enjoy. Treasures abound. There is a nice restaurant in the courtyard."

We are fans of old manor houses and their decor and we hoped to see a nice, antique house and learn its story. Somehow, looking at trip advisor reviews, we believed we are going to find these, on top of the art collection. Sadly, the art is the only thing to see at this place, as most of the rooms were renovated petty recently and there is nothing to discover regarding the story of the house. If it is art you're looking for, you should be more than satisfied, as the collection is immense. If it's something else, it's probably not the best place for you.Some tips:There's a guided tour at 14:30.There's also an audio guide available for 4 pounds at the reception."

We were at a loss to entertain ourselves on a Saturday afternoon, so essayed the Wallace Collection as recommended by a relative. The, um, traditional array of paintings and porcelain was better than we'd expected; we suggest you organise some sort of competition based on counting the number of dead animals in the Weenix paintings. The real star, for us, was the Armoury. Galleries of items that document industry and craftsmanship, but on items intended to maim and kill. I found it absolutely fascinating, both admiring the workmanship and contemplating the use of these things. Not to mention their history, particularly those from Asia and India. These are tangible reminders of the fraught relationship that Britain has with these countries, but it's important to remember that we live in a different age with different forms of Imperialism. The European armour is simply astounding. Declarations of wealth, of intent, of desire to protect. There are cuirasses bearing the impact scar of the bullets that 'proved' them. There are pikes, boar spears, two-handed swords, rapiers, knives, jousting armours, horse armours. Come and be amazed. And remember to refer to the bound catalogues for more information about each item - the catalogues themselves speak volumes about people fascinated by the items they catalogue. just writing this review makes me want to go back, spend more time wondering at the items and the implications of their existence. The caf\u00e9 food is excellent. Like the Museum itself, it has a very Adult ambience: although I daresay some children will enjoy the Wallace Collection - and they do have some things that will appeal to kids - to me this seems a fundamentally adult place to spend time. There is some seating for visitors in most rooms."

Consequently when we were eventually served I asked for the food and drink to arrive at the same time. The waiter claimed this was not possible.... Our not very exciting finger sandwiches,scone and 3 tiny cakes came 20 minutes after the pots of tea. I did get fresh tea brought when I expressed my dissatisfaction but this is not acceptable and it ruined what was supposed to be a special occasion.

I fell in love with this museum and everyone else I went with fell in love with it too. There are so many master pieces and each of them tell an interesting and an intriguing story.The Staff are very welcoming and the museum have a beautiful caf\u00e9 that we relax in it when we feel tired.I wish everyone can pay this museum a visit, they wont be disappointed."

You can reach it on the center or jubilee tube line, getting off at Bond Street. It is away from the touristy areas and therefore not crowded. It is free with a restaurant in the covered courtyard for lunch and tea. The collection spans baroque, rococo, and neoclassic styles from the French artists of the Louis XIV and Louis XV. It has one Titian and some Dutch masters as well. Definitely worth a visit if you are into French art."

Very slow service, grossly expensive dishes, so tiny you need to go somewhere else to eat. Very disappointing. High expectations, but really unacceptable. Cafe situated in a lovely area, so you really do think you will have a special experience, sadly not. Leave before you order, or you will be sitting there waiting. And be disappointed, sadly I could not find a separate way to review the cafe, but the Wallace Collection itself is quite wonderful, so this review should not be read about the collection, but only THE CAFE."

On the ground floor there are several rooms packed with European and Middle Eastern armours, most amazing being the daggers, long guns and knives encrusted with precious stones or simply having different texts on them, lying next to gorgeous armours in the fashion of the Ottoman empire (although not as many as in museums in La Valetta). You do not know where to look first as the collection is simply amazing and there are plenty of sitting areas to relax and enjoy everything. If you are into these kind of things, trust me, you will pat yourself on the shoulder for visiting it."

London has many hidden treasures and in Manchester Square, just off the crowded nightmare of Oxford Street, is the finest of them all - The Wallace Collection. Hertford House - formerly known as Manchester House when it was built in 1778 - once belonged to the Marquesses of Hertford, among the world's greatest art collectors. They were immensely wealthy and could outbid even the Rothschild family - something they took great pleasure in doing. The collection was founded by the 1st Marquess of Hertford and continued through the line of succession, but it was the 4th Marquess, Richard Seymour-Conway, who bought most of what you see today. His collection of 18th century French paintings is unrivalled except by the Louvre. He adored beautiful things and what you see at the Wallace Collection is the cream of the paintings, furniture, porcelain, armour and many other artefacts acquired by the Marquess and his antecedents. As you wander around this opulent London townhouse you will find paintings by Rembrandt, Titian, Velasquez, Rubens, Gainsborough, Reynolds, Murillo and many more, including the famous \"Laughing Cavalier\" by Frans Hals. There are exquisite collections of Sevres porcelain, French furniture and miniatures. There is an extensive collection of arms and armour and exquisite collections of miniatures. Eye - popping stuff, to be sure.But this is no mere art gallery, oh no. This is a ravishingly beautiful house in its own right and every room is hung with paintings as though it were still a house lived in and loved. This is London's finest example of an aristocratic town house, open to the public. As you enter through the pillared portico, you enter into a world of beauty and no little privilege. The grand staircase, hung with several huge paintings by Francois Boucher, gives you a tantalising glimpse of what delights await. There is also a fantastic restaurant in the great courtyard. Hertford House and the greater part of the art collection were left to the nation by the widow of Richard Wallace, the illegitimate son of the 4th Marquess - although there is little actual proof that he was the father. Wallace, and his wife Amelie, used Hertford House - as it was now known - as their London base after moving back from Paris, and they brought the greater part of the extensive collection with them.The 4th Marquess lived in Paris most of the time and used Hertford House to store much of his ever expanding collection. When he bought Ruben's painting \"Rainbow Landscape\" in 1856 he outbid both the National Gallery and the Rothschilds. The painting was sent to Hertford House and the Marquess, who preferred to live in Paris, never saw it.If you only have time to visit one gallery in London, let it be the Wallace Collection."

On our most recent trip, we enjoyed a simple lunch in their peaceful and relaxed atrium restaurant. On every visit, I now enjoy seeing the collection of paintings, furniture, carvings, and sculpture. It is a fascinating variety of pieces, displayed in an accessible and elegant manner. It's not a large place, but I have never seen it crowded. Easy walk from Selfridge's, another of our standard stops when visiting London."

Now that I've discovered what gems can be found here, I am determined to return on a quieter day and have a good look at the paintings and other precious collections displayed in the multicoloured flock-papered rooms. Events such as this must be a major money spinner for the museum. Unfortunately, bar staff seemed unprepared for the sheer number of visitors, and it just seemed ridiculous to have to queue twice, once to order and again to pay for your drinks. Not very sophisticated. Perfectly understandable that you are not allowed to walk about with your drink, but rather annoying when you've paid more than a tenner for a glass of bubbly and David McAlmont is about to hit a high note in one of the upstairs galleries."

The Wallace Collection is a free national museum in an historic town house that houses a beautiful collection of historical antiques; although I have to confess to not looking around too much but heading to the central atrium cafe for afternoon tea. The cafe boasts a space that offers al fresco dinning in a lovely setting, with trees and sculptures and lots of lovely natural sunlight. The afternoon tea features classic homemade scones, with jam and cream; a selection of finger sandwiches, including a vegetarian selection on request and a number of delicious cakes to enjoy. Not forgetting a choice of teas or coffee served in Chinese t-pots. My one and only complaint is that a second pot of tea is extra although not enough to break the bank. Recommended for a relaxing and enjoyable afternoon."

I spent a good two hours just scouting them alone, examining each piece individually. I had arrived mid-afternoon so only had a few hours to visit - I quickly discovered this was not sufficient. I had to skip a lot of the upstairs rooms, even rush through some as I simply did not have the time to properly appreciate all the stunning collections. I would recommend visiting first thing in the morning, so as to allow yourself enough time to see the entire house.I decided to tag along on the 2PM tour - the tour guide was knowledgeable but due to the amount of rooms was only able to talk about one item per room, which was a little frustrating as it felt we were missing out on so much. I wouldn't recommend the tour for the simple fact you would be better exploring it yourself.I also found the information on the pieces to be a little lacking. I am a tour guide myself, and had been advised by a friend there was a Vernis Martin desk which I would be intrigued to see. It took me a very long time to find it! I eventually found a tiny label indicating it was the one I had been searching for, but it had no further details which was a little bit of a let-down. In terms of location, it is central however a little difficult to find. I ended up having to set up google maps on my phone to direct me towards the house. Getting back to the tube station was even more confusing.Overall, I would very much recommend the Wallace Collection for anyone interested in history or antiques, particularly that of the armouries."

If you are into big old paintings and huge Dresden pots, heavy furniture and dramatic chandeliers then this is just the place for you.There are saucy paintings by Fragonard and chubby nudes by Rubens. You get the gist.The paintings are from the 'who is who' of old world-famous artists.If you are not into this kind of stuff you will enjoy the house nonetheless!This is one of the very few museums which feels as if it is really loved.It is a place which feels ''alive'.The volunteers working there are fabulous - friendly, attentive and kind.There is so much love and attention to detail that even people like me who are definitely not into that kind of stuffy art get interested. I was never into porcelain but I became interested when I visited the Wallace collection.The Wallace collection is a delightful treasure trove with a wonderful atmosphere. There is a nice cafe /restaurant in a light-filled courtyard. It is upmarket and on the pricey side but a real treat, though the waiters like to ignore customers so you have to wave very hard to get their attention.Everything feels happy and peaceful.There is a delightful petite shop in the Wallace collection. Nothing is tacky there. They got a good selection of books relating to the art displayed as well. I bought the larger guidebook - I think it cost seven or eight quid. But it is on high gloss paper and the colours of the reproductions in it are good.I wouldn't bring small kids. Leave them at home and give yourself an art and educational treat!But if you try to educate stroppy teenagers - they probably will - like me - suddenly get an inkling of a period and styles which up to then was not accessible.My personal highlights were the miniatures of Napoleon. The oval drawing room was delightful in its proportions and in its 'feminine' theme.By the way: The Museum feels very romantic! It might be a great place for a rendezvous - for 'golden oldies'.For me the visit was an eye- and mind-opening experience. It trained my eyes to see styles of art, I was never into, in a new way. So I definitely will be back - to learn more."

The Wallace also gives the visitor a good impression how the later Victorian and Edwardian elite in London actually lived. Plan to spend 90 minutes here, and then do some shopping on nearly Oxford Street. Visited the Wallace Collection for the first time this weekend, despite living locally for many years. Given that there's free admission, you really have no excuse not to while away an hour or two at the Collection. This impressive Edwardian mansion on Manchester Square (three blocks from Selfridges) is a gem! Yes, there is plenty of third-rate art and an overabundance of objects d'art scattered throughout the Wallace, but there are also occasional gems - paintings, minatures, armor and furniture."

You will recognise many of the original paintings there but seeing the originals is rather special. The rooms have been renovated over the past few years and the colours are wonderfully vibrant and give a good sense of what the house would have been like when it was lived in. The Wallace restaurant is the perfect place for an afternoon tea treat after spending time looking around the collection.

We had a two hour window in London to fill and there was too much here for two hours.I'm not very good at appreciating art, but if you are, then you will love the really impressive collection of famous artists' work. I was more impressed by the building's interior decor and the armour rooms. Some of the miniatures of Napolean caught our eye but we didn't see all of the collection at all and I'll have to go back.The cafe/restaurant is table service and the service charge of 12.5% will be added to your bill. The cakes aren't cheap but the ambiance is great and, given that entrance had been free, I didn't object to the prices. The thing that was irksome was the slow service. I should have perhaps been more assertive when I wanted the bill but we spent about 20 minutes in here waiting for the bill when we could have been looking around.As you're looking around you need to refer to the books in the rooms for descriptions of the items as the guides in the rooms won't necessarily know. Even then we found a glaive, as described in the book, and it looked fearsome, but we couldn't quite figure out how it would have been used. Research via smartphone wasn't overly illuminating either. None of the online images quite matched what we'd seen although I now have a new word to use if I ever take up Dungeons and Dragons."

Like all speculators (word used here in the neutral sense, as guessing an uncertain future, not as dirty capitalists), they sometimes get it right, sometimes less so. Whether the buyers exercised judgement all the time or pursued opportunities as they come, is untold. The result is a somewhat disparate collection of what was anticipated to be fashionable then. Visitors should not impose themselves to visit all, but can discard what, in their own judgement, went to the dead ends of history of art.The rooms are arranged with the constraints given by the original set up. However, a lack of imagination has struck. Labelling of works is on the minimal side. A lot of staff members show their boredom and their longing for retirement. The use of digital technologies seems unknown. This may be part of the visit, I guess?"

Beautiful Georgian townhouse just behind Oxford Street. Huge collection of famous paintings, and large collection of armoury (some of which you can try on). I don't know anything about paintings but the guided tour taught me so much, and brought the house and its contents to life. Imagine the opulence of Windsor Castle state rooms, Tower of London Armoury rooms, National Gallery paintings, on a smaller scale in a Georgian Town House. The caf\u00e9/restaurant is beautiful, with delicious food. Your coats can be left at the front foyer, the toilets are clean and well equipped, no queues anywhere despite it being a Bank Holiday!

I used to live in London and have since been back over a dozen times and I had never heard of the Wallace collection until a friend introduced me to it last year. Set in a former private 'country' estate (the city has since swallowed up the country around the house), the collection includes a huge amount of 18th and 19th century interior design and jewelry, as well as an enormous collection of weapons. Yeah, *that* diverse. Many pieces came from the royal collection at Versailles and Madame de Pompadour's estate, purchased after the Revolution. These collections are really stunning, and you should view them during a tour, which can provide the context and detailed information on the pieces that you'll see. In addition, the central courtyard has been glassed over and is now an all-weather cafe - really a nice place to come and have tea or a full meal. I'd highly recommend this hidden gem."

Behind Oxford Street on the north side, the museum houses the collection of Sir Richard Wallace and includes classic art including paintings, sculpture, china and furniture. Of predominantly French origin, the collection also includes works by English and Dutch artists of varying notoriety. Do your research to identify the world-famous paintings one can see here. I would liken this museum to the Frick in New York City as the types of works are similar as is the setting of a family house.

I visited this place on a recommendation from a close friend who had suggested this as a pleasant day out with affordable afternoon tea. I decided to pre-book our visit to cater for our group of 11, who had planned a visit for our friends baby shower as part of her weekend of pampering. The telephone booking was very informal, I informed the lady on booking that the numbers are not completely confirmed but she was quite happy to take the booking, no reservation fee was taken, no terms and conditions stated. We were very excited because the gallery looked beautiful from the pictures and it certainly didn't dissapoint with beautiful paintings, artefacts, exquisite furnishings and decor. We had pre-booked our afternoon tea and we were seated at our table by one of the waiters. We informed them that 2 of our party had cancelled that morning due to childcare issues and therefore we no longer needed as many seats at our table. The extra small table was removed from our party and set up to accommodate for other guests, as the restaurant takes walk in customers for their afternoon tea. Unfortunately it went downhill from there. The whole afternoon was ruined by a completely unpleasant man who I assume is the manager. A chap dressed in a suit who couldn't be more unhelpful or rude if he had tried.Having made some dietary requests on pre-booking, we were promptly told that those changes may not have been made and he would have to check with the chef but they would try to accommodate nonetheless. Well this was fine, it happens. We told him that was fine and appreciated that he would try. We were then handed the menu for the afternoon tea. We asked if we could order any sides with our afternoon tea and were told that we couldn't because the restaurant doesn't open alongside the afternoon tea (this was strange as others who had visited recently had recommended ordering sides because the tea wasn't quite filling enough and had done so themselves without any difficulty).On choosing our preferred teas from a range of teas available on the afternoon tea menu, we were told by this man that because we were a group of 11, we could only choose from breakfast or mint tea. Well this baffled us, surely if you book afternoon tea, you should be able to choose the teas from that menu? And why should the number of your party restrict your options? When we raised this point, the gentleman had no response as to why this rule applied. Nonetheless we prompted to choose from the 2 options available. A member of our party remembered that in fact we were no longer a party of 10 so we clarified if we would now be able to have a choice of teas. The man then informed us that whether they had turned up or not, we would have to pay for their afternoon tea also?! When we questioned why that was the case, he tried to suggest that it was because we had pre-booked and that was their policy. Then when we probed why this hadn't been mentioned on booking, he changed his tune and tried to suggest that this was because of the dietary changes we had made. The same dietary changes he had told us earlier he wasn't even sure had been implemented. He suggested they had turned customers away because they were fully booked and therefore would be losing business. The afternoon tea runs for about 2.5hrs and having arrived at the start, we couldn't see why having a table now free and plenty of guests still in the gallery and trickling into the restaurant, the table would not be filled. Having completely ruined the atmosphere at this point, he stated that if they get walk in guests requesting afternoon tea and they managed to fill the table then we would not have to pay for the extra 2 afternoon teas for our party. Within 30 minutes the table was filled. The whole experience was abysmal. As much as we tried to enjoy our day, the sour end left a bitter taste in our mouths.On a final note, our waiter was very attentive and friendly. I recommend the restaurant management be reviewed because service like that doesn't belong in such a beautiful place. I certainly will never return and have told friends and family the same."

It is an absolute treasure trove of wonderful collections of art (Italian and Dutch especially good), ceramics, armour and curios such as exquisite 3d wax portraits, with jewel embellishments. The guide we met was friendly, informative and enthusiastic and obviously loved the being there.It wasn`t busy for a Saturday and had a peaceful, unhurried ambience. It also has a lovely enclosed courtyard dining area which was very popular. You need to go more than once to truly appreciate this special place."

How can you beat a free museum with a great collection of artwork and mid-evil armory, no crowds, and easy to get to from the Bond Street Underground station. Some folks we met on the plane over to London highly recommended this place, and I have to agree with their recommendation. Lots of 15th, 16th, and 17th century artwork. And, an amazing collection of armor, armory, guns, pistols, knives, and other war tools. A short walk from the Bond Street Underground station. We went mid-afternoon on a nice Saturday in March...no crowds and easy to take our time in the exhibits."

Definitely make use of the guides if you can! If this is your visit to London though and aren't that big of an art buff, don't bother putting it on your list."

I visited Kensington Palace which has nothing much to see and too much fake ambiance and had to pay \u00a316 to enter, it is quite incredible that one of the best museums in London is free. The Wallace Collection is in an elegant mansion townhouse in central London, easy to get to from a number of underground stations, and a haven back to a more beautiful era. The original owner of the collection bought several items at auction from France after the French Revolution government ruthlessly emptied the wonderful collections within the French palaces. The Wallace Collection holds the largest private collection in the world of French pieces and paintings from Versailles and other royal chateaus. Fortunately, the art and furnishings have been kept in perfect condition, a tribute to the owner's foresight and great love of beautiful things. The Wallace Collection is a very special place as it manages to do two very hard things: every artpiece is displayed magnificently and the house still retains the ambiance of a living home. One of my favourite places is the mezzanine floor with corner windows and large Edwardian-style plants that gives the feeling of a miniature conservatory and the great staircase that takes you up there. The staircase was saved from a former bank in Paris. When I have enough money I want to become a lifetime Friend of the Wallace Collection and be able to donate to this really wonderful place."

We got there well in time for the daily 2:30pm free tour (so had a coffee and hot chocolate in the excellent cafe first - must go there for something more extensive next time) which was conducted by a very capable Polish volunteer lady. After the tour we walked round the same rooms once more to take everything in at leisure and study in more detail what we'd seen.

Good scones and tea at the cafe, and the ambiance is not too shabby either, with its glass ceilings."

The walls are full of picture to enable comparison between styles and artists. Need a few more visits to see it all in detail . dOnt often buy guidebook butthink I will to appreciate it better."

While it is an excellent reminder of what idle rich folk did with their money - while poor folk toiled and struggled to live - see past that and you will find a visit to the Wallace Collection time well spent. It is a fascinating and uplifting tribute to arts and crafts of the past. The stunning fine illustrative work on ancient armouries, through the vivid (if not gaudy) splashes of the chunky ceramics, to the ornate and facile fussiness of the showy furniture and flash fittings, to the captivating subtlety of Reynolds and Gainsborough. Magnificent.There remains a strong feeling of the private residence here and although one imagines not everything displayed now was there when successive Marquesses of Hertford got by here when up from the country for 'The London Season\".Therein lies the rub. A privileged and noble London residence it no longer truly resembles because it is cluttered. On the other hand, it's intimate nature prevents it from being a proper gallery because it is too small. It is near impossible to step back to drink in a piece of work, either due to lack of space or because someone is trodden on.So, while this wonderful collection is not to be missed, I fear it is niether one thing nor the other and 'tis a pity. Perhaps to see the house as the Lords Hertford and all the little Hertfords saw it would provide a more complete experience. Otherwise, thin out the goodies and give us space to wallow in their majesty.The Wallace Collection is free entry for everyone and, in my book, one of the greatest free shows on Earth."

Excellent website and essential to plan visit and to avoid peak times. We received a generous welcome and were offered a guided tour at the next set time (about every two hours). We did not have time for that but had a short visit, then later regretted we had not spent more time! Everything was there to facilitate the visit, cloakroom, excellent gift shop, cafe and restaurant. We have to return soon, and it it is still free admission. It is a must to get a break from central shopping! Brilliant thank you."

The curators advise that the remarkable picture density reflects the hanging style of the period when the works were assembled, but it does undermine the experience.Faced with a dense array of paintings the \"ordinary visitor \" has to guess at what might be worthy of a pause and can easily guess wrong or give up on a room that deserves more time. Depending on which way you tour, you might easily have seen a dozen very similar Weenix still lives - slight variations on \"Pheasant in pantry\" - then find a bunch more in the next room. Are these such masterpieces that we must study them and their differences closely, or did old Mr Wallace have a penchant for partridge, or was he duped into buying a job lot? At that point your confidence in the quality of the collection begins to wane. No doubt some expert guiding would answer the question and help the inexpert visitor maximise their time, but I could not help feeling that the \"jam the aisles, pack 'em high\" presentation undermined rather than enhanced the possible enjoyment. The \"amazing\" is for the beauty of the interiors and paradoxically, for the sheer size of the collection.The caf\u00e9 - the entire glassed over inner courtyard - is a physical gem; when we visited the maitresse d' was very attentive but the actual waiting staff could barely be bothered"

If you are tired of the massive crowds at the larger national museums, treat yourself to this intimate and worthwhile place that is free. The collections of art, furniture and yes, armour, is amazing and you can wander from room to room of this mansion and pretend what it would like to call this your home. There is an intimacy you can not get at the larger museums. Reminds me of the Jacquemart-Andre Museum in Paris or the Frick Collection in New York City...museums made from former private homes. Visited near closing (3:30) and had afternoon tea (18.50 GBP) which was so much more reasonable than at hotels (Savoy - 40+ GBP) yet was still a tranquil experience in a refined setting under the glass ceilings of the central courtyard restaurant. After tea, still had 30 minutes to wander the museum rooms and the armoury on site is extensive and more impressive to me than the Tower of London or British Museum. Visit and enjoy being a tourist minus the jostling crowds. I will go back again and have afternoon tea and a wander again..."

Parts of their collection have been seen in magazines and various publications, yet not that many have been there.The Wallace Collection is actually very easy to find. It's at the back of Manchester Square, and a block or two behind Selfridges. If you are walking towards Selfridges from Oxford Circus, turn right when you get to Selfridges and a few minutes walk and you are there. It's also very near Wigmore Hall, if you're into classical music. As a museum, there is a mixture of porcelain, silverware and a very fine collection of fine paintings. These include Canaletto, Guardi and Fragonard. Dutch, French and Italian paintings are well represented. Perhaps not so well known is the collection of arms and armour. You will be hard pressed to find a finer collection in London apart from the Tower of London. You could spend several hours here. There is a nice restaurant in the courtyard and there is an interactive area downstairs for children, where you can try on armour. The good thing is, is that it's free to get in. Personally, I think The Wallace Collection is one of the finest collections in the UK and highly underrated. Think of it as all the good bits from the other major art galleries and museums in London under one roof."

The Laughing Cavalier and a host of Canalettos are just two of the highlights of thus very impressive array of unique and priceless artefacts and works of art. Definitely worth a visit, and nearby Marylebone High Street and other streets off it, are worth visiting some intriguing independent shops."

Anyone with one oita of real interest in the arts, of the nineteenth century and before should make the Wallace collection a must see ,when rounding off a basically round education . Here in a mid nineteenth century home ,of an affluent Englishman ,is a mouth watering collection of English and French art and furniture . For those interested in arms and armour there is a fine 'world ' collection . The whole collection gives one an insight in to one man's tastes and interests . Unless you are a complete Phillistine , some of this experience will enrich your soul ,. and to quote Nicholas Goodison , there is joy in the perpetual enjoyment of looking . This is NOT the place for small children ,well behaved or otherwise. There is also a fine dining experience in a covered courtyard of the old hose . The Wallace Collection also has a fine shop where the discerning might be tempted to purchase art/ postcards/CDs etc "

I joined a tour at 2.30 p.m. A fluent, knowledgeable and very personable guide took us on a selected route to introduce various works. A real gem. There is no entrance fee, the tour also without charge. A quality cafe serving attractive food in genteel surroundings complements the visit.The collection is owned by the state and welcomes donations towards the considerable costs of running and maintaining the collection. After experiencing a visit a generous donation is fully warranted"

The collection of paintings, porcelain, armour and furniture is not huge, but it is very impressive.The Wallace Collection is probably best known as the home of 'The Laughing Cavalier' by Frans Hals. But many of the other works are also superb, and the claim that the gallery houses some of the best French 18th Century Art may well be true.Also, that essential part of any good museum these days - the caf\u00e9 / restaurnant - is a most pleasant, if somewhat pricey, place to sit and study the guide book.All in all, this is a place which is definately on my 'to be returned to' list."

So many visitors to London and indeed residents of the city 'stumble' across the Wallace Collection, which is surprising given its central location. A wonderful place to come to escape the Oxford Street crowds or as part of a visit around Marylebone. There is a wonderfully intimate atmosphere, it really does feel like stepping into someone's house, albeit a rather opulent, aristocratic one! It reminds me of the Frick in New York, albeit without the Vermeers, but lots to please the eye instead, including Titian, Rubens, Canaletto, Velazquez and Canaletto alongside plenty of French Masters. They have an interesting programme of exhibitions as well. Thoroughly recommended, but my one caveat is that the security guards at the entrance can be quite unwelcoming and officious, but worth persevering to the treasures beyond!"

The collections are very important and of national significance. It is worth visiting just for the Sevres and Meissen ceramics. There have been major armoury exhibitions and I believe there is one relating to Agincourt on now. I usually go to meet friends in the restaurant which is the best courtyard al fresco dining experience in London. Afternoon tea is fabulous. The facilities are great.

Wallace had a taste for painting and art in general. You will be surprised with the quantity as well as with the quality. The paintings are hanging in three rows surrounding all four walls of the main gallery. This amazing place right in the heart of London's shopping center reopened 1 year ago and you will not regret for taking this extra art dose."

This is museum worth savouring but I realise now it is also a museum worth popping in for a browse every now and then like your favourite bookshop. There are sufficient seats (it was sparsley populated even on a drizzly Saturday afternoon) to allow you to admire the rooms at leisure (the paintings of Venice my favourite). And the cabinets of hidden gems will take you hours to discover. Now with a restaurant which I am keen to try on my next visit this is an oasis away from the hustle and hustlers of Oxford Street. Entry is free but a large donation is definitely warranted on at least one of your visits."

Unbelieveably, still free (very generous bequest), this is a powerhouse collection of fine and decorative arts - with every period and nationality (well, European, that is) of the history of art beautifully represented. You'll glide round this mansion (it's laid out as a grand 'house' collection with sumptuous room settings) and just let everything sink in. Aside from the pleasure of the place - it's spot on for research and holds monthly events/tours/lectures etc. to suit most levels (incl. family/children/seasonal). On a more basic level - beautiful cafe/restaurant in the 'atrium' of the house pricey but well worth the treat; gift shop likewise, but possibly not quite so worth it! GO."

A stone's throw off Oxford Street, the Wallace Collection is small but imposing, a grand house hosting a serious art collection - from paintings through furniture to ceramics and clocks, this is an important collection well worth viewing. Great restaurant in the courtyard worth going for alone, but do take some time to browse. Excellent tours offered too - well worth the hour or more it takes to go through the collections highlights. And it's free - incredible!"

While competing with prestigious large museums in London, the Wallace collection stands on its own for what I enjoyed as a good balance between a nice historical building (the family house where the collection is hosted) and the variety of the pieces on display. Not being too big, it makes an easy visit; the display is logically organized among the different rooms, and you can quickly decide what you want to focus on; however, it pays to go through each room, at least quickly, to get a full flavour of the house itself, the original use of each room and how the collection grew in time to fill them. The web site is well done, it gives a good description of what is displayed inside (porcelain, armour, furniture, in addition to paintings of various nature). The position is central and easily reachable (nice complement to a day in the centre of London), the staff is kind and helpful while watchful of the artwork on display (often unprotected, thus giving the real flavour of a private collection). I was very happy to visit, and will go back possibly trying the caf\u00e9 (though I have read many unfavourable reviews - anyway, plenty of places are available around the house)."

I would have given it 5 stars except the cafe had shut at 4.30 just before my sister arrived and would not serve her a cup of tea.

It houses paintings by artists such as Titian, Rembrandt, Hals and Vel\u00e1zquez . Apart from paintings, you also see an exquisite collection of eighteenth-century French paintings, porcelain, furniture. The intimate nature of the museum makes viewing quite special. Though I have no strong interest in 17th century or 18th century French, Flemish or Dutch paintings, I was intrigued by the opportunity to have an insight into how the really privileged build up their own private collection. The curatorship in itself is an interesting story. So, I would resist the temptation to whisk through the room as you would miss much of the context and the narrative behind the collection. The restaurant in the atrium is a fine place for a meal and drink. Compared to the extortionist price and terrible food you get in the lourve, the cafe in the Wallace museum is a 3 michelin star restaurant."

I looked at some pictures she'd been sent and it looked great I then googled it and I filed the info in my brain but only recently when thinking of possible places to take a friend for her birthday remembered it. So glad I did we met for lunch in the beautiful airy courtyard which was delicious then spent the afternoon viewing the myriad delights on offer. So many beautiful items to see displayed in lovely rooms. There is nothing stuffy or serious about the place despite the grandeur its inviting and relaxed. Such a brilliant place I loved it I even tried on chain mail which although heavy was surprisingly comfortable. We left saying we couldn't believe we had never been before and both agreed to visit again soon as there is so much to see it deserved more time than we had allotted. We left feeling happy and uplifted that we'd discovered such a gem of a place to visit. "

You'd walk around with someone who would turn out to be a leading authority on 18th century French painters and perhaps Fragonard in particular. He or she might pause before The Swing to explain that this sort of painting was meant to titillate and invite us to consider the fact that the young woman depicted would be grossly deformed if she ever got off the swing. Her proportions were all wrong: rather like Barbie Doll.My wife and I were there again this week. There's so much there to enjoy whether it be paintings, furniture, clocks, snuff boxes miniatures and armour, the list goes on. Each time we're there we gaze in awe at The Laughing Cavalier. He looks ready to step out of his frame and talk to us. There's so much to see and yet the setting makes the exhibits seem more accessible than they might be in the great museums.There's a caf\u00e9/restaurant which is very good. My wife tells me that the ladies' loo is splendid. She had her own little bathroom as it were, with the luxury of your own hand basin. There are a few benches outside the main entrance. A perfect place to relax and enjoy the sunshine for a while."

It has a fine (if idiosyncratic) coillection. Some excellent art: a Hals, a couple of Rembrandts, etc. -- some very good Boucher, if you like pre-French Revolution French art. And a lot of not quite first rate painters (and some rather academic 19th c. French art). It has wonderful furniture -- in every room. Statues. Miniatures. 15th c. maiolica plates and vases. And three or four rooms of armour, daggers, and guns.It is well worth a visit, and it does not have the hordes of tourists of the National Gallery. (If you know the Frick in NYC, the Wallace is like that, but with more space and more items.)It also has a restaurant, which serves lunch and -- 2.30 to 5:00 -- high tea, for about L17.50. Delicious. Choose your tea (black, green, or herbal). You get three half sandwiches, a scone with clottted cream and jam, and three sweets. We ate at 2.30, instead of lunch. Delicious, and fun"

The galleria is very close to the busy Oxford street, just several bus stops from the Marble Arch tube station. All about this place is exceptional: the collection, the building and the stuff. If you are very short on time, you can skip a first floor exhibition of armory and go straight to the upper floor where the main masterpieces of painting are displayed. Among the painters represented are Titian, Rubens, Rembrandt, Vel\u00e0zquez, Poussin, Canaletto, Gainsborough and Lawrence. But if you do have time, I'll recommend you to spend extra hour or two and explore the whole collection, including miniatures, furniture and armory. Take a break in the winter garden cafe and enjoy delicious, but expensive snake. If you want to have a lunch you can do so, but be prepared for a high price tag."

One of the rooms has the walls covered entirely in emerald green Dupioni silk brocade. It is gorgeous to look at, and even more amazing when you realize the silk \"wallpaper\" probably cost over $100,000. The art are very interesting. For example, in most museums you will find one or more Canaletto paintings. In the Wallace Collection, there are six ... and they are all in one relatively small room. So, instead of having them spread throughout the museum, they are all in one place where you can easily see and compare them without moving. It is magical."

You will find period paintings by reknowned Old Masters and other European artists, as well as sculptures, ceramics, furnishings, clocks and arms and armour. If you already have seen all the major museums in London this is a good secondary stop. Admission is free and there is an attractive cafe in an interior courtyard. Note: I consider this museum to be more of an adult attraction despite the armour display since space is limited and there is not really enough room for young children to wander around. You will especially enjoy it if you like period furnishings and interiors."

In a city in which museums are packed to the gills and too trendy for their own good, The Wallace Collection excels because it has outstanding offerings in a select range of artists, including Gainsborough, Canaletto and other exponents of 18th and 19th century landscape paintings, you can immerse in these works quietly and contemplatively. It is a pleasure to discover works that are not \"blockbuster\" but are instead the achievements of masters who do not often command our full attention. We pay attention in new ways and this enables us better appreciate art in general. There is one famous work--Frans Hals's \"Laughing Cavalier\"--and paintings you might not know by Rembrandt and Velasquez. The building itself is fascinating and historic and in its rooms you can envision a life of privilege in bygone days. There is also a lovely cafe/restaurant with outdoor tables in a central courtyard that makes a worthy destination even if you don't spend much time looking at the art."

For me, gawping at Victoria wealth expressed through oil paintings and ceramics isn't an aesthetic experience, it's a political revulsion! But, my friends were more tolerant and especially appreciated the guns and armoury. We all appreciated the tea, sandwiches, and cakes had in the central glass covered inner courtyard.

I still managed to stay a good part of the day because I enjoyed the collection so much and I particularly liked the free guided highlights tour I went on even though I do not usually like tours. Our guide was an arts professional and very knowledgable and interesting. The collection is amazing and because a portion of the building had once been a private home, it is set up as a house with exquisite furnishings that complement the paintings perfectly. I also had lunch in the covered courtyard and it was delicious though, as is common in museum restaurants, the lunch portions are small (but, I am a pretty big guy). I strongly recommend that visitors to London make time to visit this free museum."

My five and six year olds love this place - and I like it for evening functions too!If you are going with kids, maybe think about starting in the basement - there is some very unsung kids stuff there (hugely heavy suits of armour - a real lesson for the kids!) and then up via the armour. That said, my girls are very happy to potter round the pictures on the first floor. The volunteers are incredibly friendly, not pompous or off-putting and have really given an insight to both my kids on our visits. Would unhesitatingly recommend for a microcosm of great british history - and if you go on Sundays, you can park for free in the square. Very convenient for Oxford street, too!Nice shop, fairly high end - and how privileged are we as a nation that a place like this remains free to access."

At first glance I thought I'd made the wrong choice to come here - lots of 18th century French paintings crammed into a room - but the more I explored the more I came to enjoy the Wallace. There's plenty of European painting up until the late 19th century, lots of furniture, ceramics, armour and weaponry, laid out in a house that's a bit like a British version of the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum in Boston. The cafe is is a lovely covered atrium and combined appealing food (endive & Roquefort salad - delicious; carrot cake - decadent) with good service. I'd suggest that the Wallace is ideal for an art-lover who's on their second or third trip to London, or who has a few hours to spare. And no crowds!"

Crammed with not only fabulous pieces of art but armour and all sorts of other stuff as well. Unlike the more well known galleries and museums it was warm and welcoming and it really felt like you were going into someone's home. We originally planned to pop in for a brief visit but ended up staying for hours. The painting ,'The Laughing Cavalier' is here. In the holidays there are activities organised for families with children. There is a splendid restaurant and cafe which has been created by putting a roof between two buildings which makes you feel as if you are in an orangery or glass house and is gorgeous.

None of the items are contemporary. The cafe was very calm and serene in a huge glass ceilinged area with a few trees, set in a quad in the centre of the building. We didn't have time to see everything as there was so much, but will go again to see what we missed and enjoy more tea and cake."

A truly magnificent experience, starting with the location in Manchester Square, the house itself, the atmosphere as you enter. A great collection of paintings, many of which I have seen before in reproduction, and several wonderful pieces that were new to me. Incredible collection of Sevres porcelain, much of it previously owned by Louis XV, and fabulously over-the-top furniture. There is also a collection of arms and armour, which we did not have time to see, so we shall visit again soon. An unforgettable experience (and it is free! Amazing!)."

The beautiful building houses an unusual collection ranging from Ceramics from the French court to medieval armoury. I got the audio guide but thought it was quite useless. They tried to sell me a guidebook instead and seemed quite crestfallen when I declined! The art work was really quite interesting and well worth checking out. The armoury section is surely where Game of Thrones got their inspiration! Though why have one helmet when you can have 50 of the same one. Less is more? We had lunch in the Cafe which was nice, I treated myself to a chocolate dessert, which was to die for!"

What an amazing collection - and it's free! There are three main themes- paintings, ceramics and weapons. The painting collection is large and eclectic with several big \"names\". The ceramics are mostly majolica and include some rare and early patterns. The weapon collection is quite extraordinary and you are forced to question whether some of the firearms were ever intended to be fired! There are some very special art pieces amongst the firearms and armour section and the quality of manufacture is of the highest quality. This collection of firearms would rival the Met or the Musee de Chasse in Paris. If fancy ancient guns are your thing, you will enjoy this collection. The building is wonderful and there is an attractive central covered courtyard which houses a cafe ( not sampled by me)."

After fighting the crowds at the V & A, the fact that only a couple of dozen other visitors were in evidence was an absolute treat. You can absolutely stand and admire a Rembrandt with no one to elbow you aside. The rooms are stunning, and the armor collection was amazing. I didn't even know I was interested in armor, but up close it's hard not to be riveted by the gloriously decorated swords and suits. My personal favorite was a tiny pistol no bigger than a pack of gum. Highly recommend."

All the way from sneaky knives, to huge suits of armour and big axes. Not only do you get to see them, there are clothes and armour available to try on as well! Aside the awesome armoire, there are some good works of art that are unique and quite interesting; There are some brilliant sets of kitchenware and furniture.

For those, who love to see the 'old' masterpieces in a more intimate surounding than the National Gallery I can highly recommend the Wallace gallery. I very much enjoyed the guided tour through the collection and also bought the guide book, which contained explanations and descriptions of the place. Although, i had visited London several times, I have to admit that i was ignorant about the Wallace collection, though it is located not far away from the most pulsating streets of London. Not far from the Bond street station, you will find a quiet oasis, charming rooms and friendly staff to share their knowledge free of charge with you. Moreover, in each room you will find information sheets to guide you. Also well done is the composition of art master pieces (paintings, furniture, porcelain etc.) according to the era the stem from. Moreover, comfortable seating arrangements allow you to rest in the middle of the room to enjoy the athmosphere and masterpieces. I did not have time for the armourment exhibition, so i cannot comment on that part of the exhibition."

The collection is so varied; from paintings, including works of Joshua Reynold, furniture and one of the largest collections of armour I have ever seen.

A little gem hidden behind posh shopping area Marylebone High St, the collection is housed in a stunning historic building, the home of its former owners, the Marquesses of Hertford and Richard Wallace, whose widow gave the collection to the nation. It's a European art collection and is particularly strong on eighteenth-century art of France, Italy and England. There's also some arms and armour, including an amusing Indian dagger with a smiling tiger's head! It's home to some lovely seventeenth-century Dutch paintings, including Van Dyck, Rubens and Rembrandt's intimate portrait of his son Titus at age 16. I use the collection for costume research, as the details on portraits such as Franz Hals' 'Laughing Cavalier' are excellent. There's a charming caf\u00e9 at the back of the house with a good set menu at lunch, tasty cakes and a variety of refreshments. Truly a hidden London gem."

What makes the Wallace Collection really special is the fact that it is not just an art gallery, but also a collection of porcelain and fine furniture all together within a splendid London house. The whole really is greater than the sum of its parts. i am not a great fan of Rococo but in this setting the paintings by Boucher and Fragonard create a wonderful effect. But it is not just Rococo, there are paintings by Gainsborough, Reynolds, Velazquez, Canaletto and Hals to name but a few, as well as some impressive Sevres and amazing furniture. There is printed information in each room and you can also hire an audio guide.The cafe / restaurant is very pleasant with a glass roof almost creating the impression that you are eating outside. However, was not so impressed with the goats cheese salad which contained a few meagre crumbs of cheese although it was eventually replenished when I took it back."

However, even for me, I found the Wallace Collection to be really interesting. Most impressive for me was the intimate nature of the collection, you can get right up to most of the furniture with only small, delicate or breakable items put behind screens. It's a definite must see for anyone who likes their armour and swords/shields/pikes as it is one of the biggest collections of these going. It is all housed in a beautiful building a 10 minute stroll from Baker St tube station or from Oxford Circus. Its also presently free to enter, however they ask you to leave bags in a free cloakroom."

To the left of the airy room you can have a light repast, to the right a more substantial meal, both I can heartily recommend.

But all the snuff boxes with minitiature painting on it were beautiful too. They also have paintings from the Dutch painters Rembrandt and Hals (The Laughing Cavalier) You can take an audio tour or a guided tour, but there are booklets with information in each room as well. It is easy to find: just go to Selfridges in Oxford Street and walk through the street on the right from Selfridges, just walk straight ahead until you see a small park, the building is on the other side of the park."

The Wallace Collection is one of those places we've never quite got round to in London and decided to try it when we had a spare day. The collection is set in a beautiful 18th century house and there is a wide range of different items on display. They have a particularly fine collection of Sevres, along with 18th century French furniture, and the paintings. As always with a collection of this kind, the pictures are a mixed bag - for example, there are a large number of second-division standard French painters from the early 19th century that are not well known now, but when the paintings are good, they're very good. The best are in the Great Gallery - a couple of van Dycks, Valasquez' Lady with a Fan, and The Laughing Cavalier. For those who like this kind of thing, there is also a huge collection of armour. And to this a classy shop and restaurant and free entrance and you have a serious good day out. Well worth seeking out."

This museum is unique in that it consists of artifacts collected by one family over about four centuries and it is housed in the building they called home. It includes a wonderful collection of paintings that includes Titian, Renoir, Gainsborough, Cannuletto , Sir Joshua Reynolds, just to name a few. To stand in front of The Laughing Cavalier by Hals and admire the intricate brushwork in the lace of the collar and cuffs is a treat. There is something here for everyone and admission is free. Photography is also allowed. The Peyton and Byrne cafe is excellent and the galleries making up the Armory are fascinating. if we lived in London we would be visiting on a regular basis. Most of our local friends have always meant to visit (if they were aware of it at all), but all are planning a day to visit now."

Each room has books on the room's contents so we were continually looking up items to get more information (a fantastic option)! In the lower level they actually have some demo armor pieces (5 or so) you can try on. Heavy stuff!

The Collection offers something for everyone, and if you have no interest in painting, for example, you will find a number of rooms devoted to the history of weapons. Tours are available, but I found it very easy to just wander solo and skip over bits of little interest to me.

Hartford House, the home of the Wallace Collection, quietly sits in Manchester Square, a seventeenth century building on the back of Oxford Street, with large and beautifully maintained rooms which retain their original homely charm, rather than that of a museum. Among other works of art, exhibits include paintings, furniture, swords. Free Tour Highlights of the Collection every day at 2.30 pm, as well as weekend concerts, and other cultural activities. Staff are instinctively polite and helpful and there is a relaxed feeling of quiet enjoyment which makes a visit so very special. Admission is free. Open 7 days a week. There is a very good shop and a stunning restaurant for breakfast, lunch, tea, events and dinner. For me, this building represents the essence of elegant Britishness and should not be missed."

This is personal.(My friend and I personally felt that the collection reflected a love for tatas. See pics.) ;) Other reasons for going here-1. It's in a lovely neighborhood. It's enjoyable to walk around Marylebone and there are some great restaurants nearby.2. It has \"the swing\" by Fragonard. Fun, saucy painting you should research before coming.3. Super book/giftstore. I love art but I also like to shop and they have fun things."

It was a really interesting tour with a knowledgable docent, and we really learned a great deal.We then wandered around a bit more - it is a BEAUTIFUL building, with a great somewhat eclectic collection (which adds to the total charm).So I would recommend this to anyone with some time to spare near Oxford Street.we also had a quick cup of tea in their courtyard, which is lovely, and where they do the three tiered tea, I noticed.I intend to return soon"

The downstairs retains an incredible collection of European arms and armour, as well as oriental weapons. The European armour, however, was my favorite. It is magnificently displayed, and there is a wonderful wide variety of dates and makes. For the weaponry and/or art buff, a must see."

Do yourselves a favor art lovers and go! From perhaps the finest Collection of French porcelain to oils by Rembrandt, Canaletto, van Sykes and more plus an armory collection fit for its own museum, this is a 2 hour treat for sure. Art treasure that belonged to French kings, Marie Antoinette and much more to describe. Don't worry about going hungry since there is also a restaurant inside. Restrooms as well."

Friends took us and the first surprise was entrance was free, although donations are much appreciated. (Another must see exhibit that is free in London is The Imperial War Museum). The next surprise continued as we walked through this extensive exhibit and continued to be awed by the multitude of treasures. We did not take one but if visited again would take a guided tour. There is a very nice cafe where one can have a nice cup of tea and a delicious Victoria Sponge or other goodies."

The collection is housed in a former home, Mansion actually, and that is the effect, as if one was slowly walking through someone's home looking at their collected treasures. There is also a fine restaurant in an atrium and several exhibits that explain how restoration is accomplished and how different items were constructed during their time.

But as it is nearby to our hotel, I searched around the web and their youtube channel and unexpectedly this happened to be one of the main reasons I wanted to go to London. After the visit I can say that for me it was THE NEXT BEST THING AFTER THE CROWN JEWELS.We've only had one hour until closing time at 05:00 PM and were in a hurry to see everything, so if you really wish to enjoy this marvelous place give yourself at least 2-2.30 hours on your visit. I can't understand how it was free entrance, because they can easily charge you 10 GBP, and still it would be worth it. AND you can take as many pictures as you like inside the Wallace Collection UNLIKE most of the places that charge you for entrance."

They have a very good cloakroom and lend out small folding stools so that the less able to stand can perch on a stool whilst listening to a guide or indeed just sit and look at some of the exhibits.

Also Gainsboroughs, Rembrandts, and the most famous of all, the Laughing Cavalier of Franz Hals. A Poussin. Some Delacroix. Others. And lots of great, great furniture, and some great porcelain. But, what I want to say is this: there is a 45 minute tour every weekday at 2:30 PM. I was lucky enough, and I mean lucky, to happen to be there at that precise minute. What a happy coincidence!

What a great collection of art here: medieval and renaissance objects, porcelain, arms and armoury, great masters like Titian, Rembrandt, Velasquez, caskets, clocks, furniture by Andre-Charles Boulle, and so much more, all in this wonderfully preserved mansion. This collection is so worth a visit."

They were avid collectors as you will see. The large gallery upstairs as you walk up the majestic staircase is something to see- rivals that of the Louvre and National Gallery. Masterpiece after masterpiece. There are objects and furniture from hundreds of years ago right before you without any barriers. The staff throughout the museum are friendly and willing to answer any questions. In my opinion, this is one of the best museums in Europe and there is no fee to enter. When you visit London, this should be on the top of your list of places to visit."

There are, indeed, some fine paintings though there are many others that are wholly unexceptional. However, I recommend you take time to check out the wonderful collection of miniatures, normally with display covers to protect them from the light, and the arms and armour section to witness some truly extraordinary craftsmanship. I try to close my eyes to the Meissen and Sevres porcelain which is almost epic in its tastelessness. Yuck! I am not a big fan of the in house cafe though others seem to drool over it. Perfectly fine but overpriced and I don't like the atrium within which it is contained. If you build up an appetite wandering around the house, Marylebone is replete with great cafes and restaurants I recommend you check out instead."

Most tourists overlook this extraordinary museum, which isn't generally on itineraries and is somewhat off the beaten track off Oxford street, though easy to find. The gorgeous, grand mansion is reason enough to stop by (free, like most of London's museums) but the stellar, surprising collection of artwork (mainly 16th - 19th century), armor, and decorative arts is world class, and nothing is ever loaned out - this is the only place to see it. The special exhibitions are also wonderful, as is the courtyard cafe and well-edited gift shop. Unlike the larger, better known institutions (British Museum, Tate, V & A for instance) there's never a horde to push past, you won't be jostled. It's a place I return to again and again - highly recommended."

Wonderful eclectic collection of Pictures, armor, and furnishings, I believe there was more authentic furniture from Marie Antoinette's than we saw at Versailles! The armory Collection is the best and most extensive I have ever seen. Some outstanding rare Pictures as well! Ron H."

We love this place, a fabulous collection of art, pottery, metalwork, armoury etc. Conveniently situated just off Oxford Street in a lovely old house. The great thing about the Wallace Collection is that you can see everything in a few hours and there is a lot to see. If you only visit one museum in London this should be the one. We have been on dozens of occasions and never tire of it."

The Wallace Collection has some beautiful rooms containing random and interesting artefacts, well maintained and presented.Moreover, it is generally fairly uncrowded and free beyond a voluntary donation. A cloakroom exists to dump all those heavy shopping bags and on rainy days they hand out plastic covers to stop wet umbrellas dripping on the wooden floors as a matter of course. Staff are friendly and relaxed.This is one of those museums that always has something new to see, even if you have been there before, simply because there are so many detailed items inside.It does help if you have SOME interest in subject matter relating to architecture of the period the building was designed in, pottery, ancient military paraphernalia, artwork and the like or you will be bored. 'Modern' does not come into it. Having said that, the space in the middle has been converted sympathetically to become an enclosed conservatory containing a warm bright cafe area. This is difficult to get seating at due to the number of wealthy pensioners and the fact that the purveyors of the place have a good rating across London (they supply a few different places). It is worth considering though if you want white table linen, table service and a feeling of peace amidst the bustle.Special events at this venue tend to be well run and worth a look in."

Entrance is free, there is a shop for anything from post cards to swords and armour. The displays of armour from all over the world were extensive but the armoured horses were amazing. There are also rooms of famous paintings which you would not have expected to find in a little known collection like this.

It really feels like what it is - namely a personal collection. The furniture is ornate and exquisite and there are art works by so many well known names like Joshua Reynolds, Franz Hals and Rubens.Try to have lunch or tea in the atrium restaurant, which is beautifully designed allowing you to sit in the covered courtyard surrounded by trees and statuary.

There are some wonderful pieces of furniture ( very intricate marquetry workmanship), hidden under lift able covers fantastic miniatures the detail of which will amaze you, snuff boxes which are as ornate as a faberge egg and much more.Because this seems to still be a hidden gem it is not over busy and the rooms are spacious, some of which have been renovated. My only gripe is the restaurant/ cafe is a trifle expensive but is a work of art in its own right being a glass covered area at the back of the building."

The paintings are wonderful and steeped in stories and history, as is the building itself and the objects to look at are beautiful and timeless. To top off our wonderful time here we ended with afternoon tea in a stunning glass roofed room which makes you feel like you are outside, but protected from the elements. Well worth a visit!"

If you don't have time to do many different museums, and just want a quick overview of the best of European and some Asian art, including paintings, laquerware, armoury (horse and human), china, glassware, snuff boxes, silverware, then head to this unassuming collection in the London mansion of the Wallace family. Another free museum, bring the kids and goggle at the knights in 100 lb armour, the horses in full metal, then pop them upstairs to view a few Rembrandts, Fragonards, Hals, Gainsboroughs. When your brain and feet can take no more go to the covered central court for tea and scones, or a glass of wine if you need reviving."

Located just north of Manchester Square, the former Hertford House holds many treasures. The large collection comprises paintings, sculpture, decorative objects, and an extremely large collection of European armor and weaponry. It is easy to get close to the art here. This is a very intimate gallery that clearly makes an effort to educate its patrons and allow them to enjoy the art on a very personal level. Each room has a printed booklet describing the artworks in that room, and the information does a great job with the provenance of much of the art, describing when the works were added to the collection. There are many paintings by well-known artists, including Rembrandt, Frans Hals, and Canaletto, to name just a few. Don't miss looking at the decorative items, including furniture, chandeliers, clocks, and urns. The shop is very nice, the restrooms are clean, and the restaurant's menu looks good, although I did not eat there. Admission to the Wallace Collection is free."

It wasn't my plan to go there but since I was at the St. Christopher's Place, and I've done much of my sightseeing that day, I decided to stop by. It was 4pm so I thought it'll be enough time to check this place out. I was so impressed with their selection of the paintings and objects(?). They had everything in this beautiful building! Sure it's smaller than London's major museums, but it's got things you would see at V&A, Tate Britain and even Tower of London all in one place! They had amazing collection of armories on the ground level. As you walk through the rooms on the upper level, you'll see paintings ,scriptures and furnitures beautifully arranged around the rooms, and I noticed many paintings are in amazingly beautiful and unusual gold frames! Each room has different color walls and chandeliers, and a spacious cafe in the middle. I wish I had more time there! Don't underestimate time. This is a small museum compare to the other major museums, but 1 hour was not nearly enough for me to see all. Very impressive museum. Enjoy your visit!"

The house itself is a beautiful Georgian building; set in small, but immaculate, grounds. The property houses an incredible collection of paintings and artefacts called the Wallace Collection, which is named after Sir Richard Wallace who was the son of the Marquess of Hertford (who was the original owner of the house and the creator of the collection). The collection has been given to the nation on the understanding that the collection is kept intact. The collection is extensive, covering the periods from the 15th through to the 19th century. It comprises many French, Dutch and Italian paintings as well as antique French furniture and a full armoury. There is a lot to see - in fact, probably my only criticism is that there are so many paintings on view in a small space that one can end up with information overload. However, as the exhibition is free - one option would be to visit different rooms on different days. There is also an excellent cafe - which offers lunches as well as a good cream tea. It also has a great selection of cakes, including a wonderful gluten free orange and plum cake!"

We took the tube to Marble Arch and it was just a short walk to the museum. It was named after Sir Richard Wallace and houses a fine collection of art from Medieval and Renaissance art, to Dutch and Flemish art of the 17th Century, and French art of the 18th Century. The ground floor has exhibits of European and Oriental Armoury. The first floor consists of different art galleries full of famous paintings and fine furnishings. We walked through beautiful drawing rooms, State Rooms, and finished off our visit with delicious teas in the outdoor glass topped conservatory area. There is no entrance fee but a donation is appreciated. You may also like to collect the odd souvenir at the gift shop. It was a wonderful way to finish seeing London."

The gallery has a number of paintings that are very well known and that you do not not expect to come across in such a small gallery. And from experience I can say that the collection of armour appeals to young children. The restaurant was very good although I haven't eaten there recently. I would highly recommend visiting even if only to recharge your batteries before heading back to Oxford Street."

There is so much to see that you need several visits to take it all in. It is a hidden gem in London that a lot of people do not know about. A short walk from Oxford Street and a welcome oasis of calm and beauty."

I would suggest getting a floor plan & focussing on the items that appeal to your particular group. There are some very fine examples of paintings, miniatures, items of pottery ,religious artefacts & armoury but sadly too much to absorb. The collection needs some way of highlighting the treasures of which there are many. I would recommend looking at a section visiting the caf\u00e9 & then moving to another section. Despite the drawbacks we enjoyed the day very much & will return on another day to see more."

This museum has an amazing collection of works of art, really too many to take in on your first visit, perhaps the most famous being The Laughing Cavalier by Frans Hals. You need at least two hours but it would be possible to spend all day there. The collection is housed in a lovely London town house. Admission is free, but a donation of \u00a35 is suggested. The internal courtyard has been roofed over and houses a lovely restaurant and cafe. The restaurant is on one side and the cafe on the other side. We had a very enjoyable light lunch in the cafe, with courteous, attentive staff."

I was stunned that Fragonard's The Swing is so tiny. I don't like baroque but this paiting is really sweet and charming. I didn't know that they have so many Rembrandts! The only part I didn't enjoy is the Arms and Armour, I was never interested in it. I think it's a great place to introduce kids to great art pieces or to spend a delightful afternoon followed by a cream tea in the cafe within the building."

He used the house as his principal London residence, holding many parties there, the most prestigious of which was the Allied Sovereigns\u2019 Ball held after the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. In 1836-51 the house was let as the French Embassy.The 4th Marquess between 1800 and 1870 lived largely in Paris and used Hertford House as a London store for his increasing art collection. It was only with the Paris Commune of 1871 that his illegitimate son, decided to move back to London, bringing a substantial amount of his Parisian collection with him.He redeveloped the house, creating a range of galleries on the first floor. After his death the house was converted into a public museum and on 22 June 1900 was first opened as a museum.

It is a huge personal collection given to the nation about 130 years ago on the condition it was kept in site and not added to. So it gives a fascinating look at the taste and lifestyle if one rich family that was much more cultured and international than the usual British Aristocrat.The Herefords/Wallace were increasingly francophile and their collection shows that as does the rather heavy French furniture and decor which provides a good backdrop to the art. The furniture and objects are high quality and will interest this who like that sort of thing.The large mansion is packed with paintings as well as some sculptures and a host of miniatures, china, pottery, chalices, etc. It is organized pretty much in chronological order so you can pick your fancy or do the whole thing. There is not much by way of explanation so buying the guide might be a good idea. I also chanced on a free docent highlight tour that was nicely done for some of the rooms.As far as I could tell, 3 generations collected fairly steadily and then Wallace got serious and bought in bulk at a time when a lot of family heirlooms were coming in the market. The rooms show this. Some are fairly restrained with the usual single or double row of largish portraits and scenes. And then you turn a corner and the place is packed from floor to ceiling. The renaissance section has good but not exceptional paintings and some lovely medieval book illustrations and goblets plates, etc. There is also a long gallery full of painted ceramic plates and rooms of armour and weapons if you are into that sort of thing. There are some good English c18 and early 19 paintings, largely portraits. A room full of Canaleto and contemporaries. But no Turner, Constable. There is huge collection of Dutch painting with Rembrandt, Rubens, Van Dyck, mixed in with a host of other names in the next level down. You get a tremendous impression of the output and skills the Dutch as well as the change in subject matter. The new great gallery at the back upstairs is impressive. Murillo, Velazquez and co fairly well represented and then you walk smack into Frans Halls The Laughing Cavalier (bought for relatively little as he was unknown in the C19). The collection is heavy on French with a lot of Watteau, Boucher and other C18 \"pretty\" painters as well as some nice still life. Lovely miniature collection. Ends with a lot of C19 French which is not all to my taste but tells you a lot about the collectors. No interest in the impressionists nor pre-Raphaelites. You get the sense they collected the recognized names.All in all it is well worth the visit and has a very nice restaurant and tea room in a covered central courtyard (reserve the restaurant and cafe at lunch time). Frick gives you a restrained collection of high quality individual pieces. Wallace gives you a riot of a century of collecting \"warts and all\"."

There are no labels on the majority of items on display so you can really lose yourself just wandering around and taking in the glorious surroundings. There is something for everyone here: suits of armour, painting, furniture, porcelain, a Napoleonic room, a Venetian room and more beautiful art than you'd think possible. In the basement there is a good little exhibition about the Wallace family who amassed the collection on display."

She was an enthusiastic older woman who had airs and graces about her that I feel put most of the tour group into a daze where they thought they should be prim and proper. Her routine was slick, comical and full of innuendo about the fascinating lives of the collectors of the paintings and the subjects within. I was sniggering the whole way listening to her commentary while the rest of the group seemed to be oblivious, humourless or perhaps (not-unreasonably) non-English speakers.Be organised and take the tour. It is free and entry is free. I bought a small book and a postcard of the famous Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard painting 'The Swing' which features a creepy old man pushing the commissioner of the painting's mistress on a swing."

It would have helped to have a notice or for the receptionist to point it out first instead of saying 'sit anywhere'!

A friend recommended this collection to us, and we were impressed far beyond our expectations. The collection of art is amazing, ranging from Constable and De Valazco to Rembrandt. Many other fine works, including many by accomplished but less well known artists, are on display as well. Most impressive too were the collections of armor, knives, swords, rifles, pistols, and a multitude of similar armaments from the Crusades and other periods ... wall upon wall, in many rooms; simply breathtaking. The structure, being an elegant and substantial Victorian mansion, is astounding in its own right. We spent two hours here and could have stayed longer. We bought a well-done book there describing the collection, family, and home, for about 6-7 pounds, which was helpful and will be a cherished reminder and keepsake. There is a restaurant on premises which looks nice but is quite pricey; due to a time constraint and line waiting, we did not try it. The restrooms are immaculate. Overall, in our view this experience is on a par with the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery (which we love). Note, there is a good selection of places to eat on James and Marylebone High Street nearby."

Other rooms full of Van Dykes, Rembrandt's, and many old masters including; Frans Hals 'The Laughing Cavalier', one of the most brilliant of all Baroque portraits. Rooms full of armour, guns and swords. Room after room full of miniatures, icons and ceramics. So much to see.I've been a number of times and see something different each time, even though the collection, left to the nation by Lady Wallace, never changes. There's just so much of it. I've taken friends, grandchildren, my husband, and even go on my own. It's fascinating,Free to all visitors, just behind Selfridges, there's also a lovely restaurant and cafe. The food is lovely; tasty and beautifully made and presented. The last meal I had there was the smoked salmon quiche, which came with potato salad and a small green salad. The quiche was beautiful. The staff are also very friendly and helpful.If ever you are in London this is an absolutely must see museum. You will not be disappointed, and I bet you'll want to go back again. PS: Whilst I've clicked good for couples it's only because I couldn't click on all the icons; Family (young children), Family (teens), Friends, Business - for a lunch, Solo. Good for them all."

Cost was around \u00a34 each, for a pot."

It lasted for approximately one hour and highlighted different elements of the collection - furniture, pottery, paintings and armour. There were so many interesting facts and I certainly felt that I learnt a great deal. The recently refurbished rooms have enhanced the hanging of the paintings, but may not be to everyone's taste. The staff were friendly and it was very easy to leave small suitcases in the cloakroom area. We did not eat there but the eating area looks very grand."

It is a wealth of artistic endeavour including the building, fabrics, furniture, sculptures, painings, obects d'atre porcelain, bronzes. It is pointless trying to list specific items. Entry is free but a donoation is requested. My one piece of advice is to try and select exactly what you want to see before you visit otherwise the result will be stimulus overload and only half remembered glimpses. Be sure to lift up the covers on the display cabinets to see one of the best collections of 19th century miniatures. A very gooo restaurant / coffee shop is available for meals and the occassional light meal. Why did I fail not to visit sooner? Small children will not appreciate a visit but teenagers will."

There are two options, the restaurant or adjoining cafe. Both great but better comfy chairs in the restaurant. If you haven't been to the gallery before, obviously do that too and come back again just to eat as a treat. No wonder the cavalier is laughing. "

The outside gives little indication of the art treasures inside. What I loved was the feeling of openness and accessibility to some of the most outstanding and excellent examples of international art from the past 500 years. The works are extremely well displayed and the visitor is allowed to view many of them up close without the usual restrictions of barriers getting in the way.We visited on a Monday and found we were able to stroll around the house and enjoy looking at the exhibits without feeling overcrowded or hustle. Not knowing what to expect in advance, we planned to be there less than two hours. In the end we were there for well over three hours and found the whole experience totally absorbing. A visit is a must."

Well worth it!Point to note for disabled access: ALWAYS call before you visit, as one time we visited the lift ('elevator' for our US cousins) was not working, and then we called a few more times in the following week and it was still up the creek (this was quite a few years ago)."

Breathtaking!A delightful coffee shop or lunch venue on the first floor and I'm not sure how you can spend a better morning in London. I'm lost for words.It's so good that everyone leaves a donation, if only out of embarrassment that it should be free. The very best of London."

The cafe in the courtyard was a lovely place to take a break from the surfeit of beauty and it was marvelous seeing paintings I'd seen in books for years and in an exquisite setting.

Room after room of mostly huge 'glitz' Italianate OTT furniture and gloomy paintings..though the famous Laughing Cavalier and the Rembrandts plus a few others lightened the viewing. There were some rare early pieces of glass and ceramics which caught my attention but unless you like galleries full of armouries and religious pieces, it can be somewhat tedious and tiring traipsing the corridors. I've rated it four as I'm sure most people would enjoy the collection more than us....just not my taste. The cafe was situated in a nice environment and the loos were very modern and clean."

I also visited the Imperial War Museum ,in London, thus month and the cafe there ( also run by the same guy) is terrible- quite a disaster!The common features of both cafes are over priced food which is poorly cooked and not very tasty!

The Wallace Collection is far from perfect, but I can't help but give it the top \"excellent\" rating because of its historical significance and artwork that can only be seen here.The Wallace Collection was amassed by several Marquesses of Hertford and Sir Richard Wallace. It is housed in what appears to be a huge mansion circa 1800 and under the terms made when the collection was donated it must stay there. The result is both good and bad. On the good, the collection is magnificent and we all get to see it for free. The impressive setting is also exactly what is needed to show off much of the art. On the minus, it's kind of a time machine frozen in the early 1800's, and it's hard some times to find the best of the best among the many, many pieces. Some rooms have walls virtually covered by oil paintings going up three or more levels, so it's impossible to see everything in one visit or, in some cases, to find a particular piece you might want. We found the staff extremely helpful, however, so if there is a particular painting or piece you want to see I wouldn't hesitate to ask.Most of the art dates from around 1400 to the early 1800s. There is no contemporary art, nor, frankly, would it fit into this setting. They have maps and materials there, but before you go you might want to take a look at the museum's excellent website, which has various \"tours\" set up for you, including one of the collection's highlights.You have already seen photos or images of much of the art in the collection as it is virtually iconic. These include the \"Laughing Cavalier\" by Franz Hals and \"The Swing\" by Jean-Honore Fragonard, along with other works. The art includes pieces from Rembrandt (although you don't need an expert to see that several are from his studio, not from him), Titian, Rubens, Hans Holbein, Velazquez, Poussin, and Jan Steen. If you are a little pressed for time, perhaps the \"best of the best\" paintings are in the newly renovated \"Great Gallery\" on the second floor. The room itself is extremely impressive, and beautifully displays these magnificent oils.You also do not want to miss the great armor galleries on the back of first floor. This is the greatest display of armor we have seen and even the members of our family with no interest in military matters were fascinated by the ornate details of many of the pieces. They also have one of the few (apparently only three exist) complete sets of horse armor from before 1500. There are many examples of jousting and ceremonial armor. There are also examples of armor from Asia.Several of the rooms have pieces under cloths to protect them from light damage. They encourage you to lift the flaps and you should do so as many are exquisite, including a miniature by Hans Holbein the Younger (of Henry VIII fame).We expected a nice museum and were surprised at the fun and quality of the armory and the overall experience of visiting here. We'd gladly come back to find the treasures we missed the first time."

It ranges from enormous paintings to tiny miniatures, most of it to a very high standard. I don't appreciate the collection of arms, but among many other collections, enamels and 18th century painting are well represented and there are also interesting temporary exhibitions. I shall try to go to see Reynolds in 2015. A snack in the glazed-in courtyard sometimes proves a bit of a struggle, but most relaxing after a two-hour visit. Entrance is free."

The rooms have been kept in original condition as far as possible, & some of the wall coverings are just beautiful. It's worth taking your time as you walk through the different rooms & galleries as there are unusual & interesting pieces everywhere.

We choose the Basserie, enironment ,service & food all very good. You are sit in an atrium which is just lovely to have all the natural light.I would suggest you order some side dishes as the size of main courses are rather small but delicious.

This is a fine collection of a very eclectic and diverse nature - from illuminated manuscripts to tiny finely detailed ivory carving, Italian painted crockery, miniatures, furniture, clocks and paintings. The paintings are impressive and ofbviously collected for their subject matter (Dutch and Flemish still lives and small vignettes of ordinary people's daily lives as well as scenes by Murillo and portraits (including ones by Rembrandt, Frank Hals, Fragonard, Reynolds and Valasquez).

We admired the curtains and the fireplaces, as well as the intense colours that separates each room. It was interesting to note the 15th - 18th century silverware, ceramics, paintings, all came from a private collection. Equally interesting is that Conway had bequeathed the rich collections to his illegitimate son, which would have been scandalous in the old GB days. And of course the generosity of Wallace's widow to leave it all to the people of GB. After a circuit tour of the various museums and galleries, one could began to appreciate the distinct brand or reputation equity of each collection. Hertford House can be included in a circuit tour along with Hyde Park, Sherlock Homes Museum, Mdm Tussauds and further down to Green Park and Buckingham Palace. A must visit."

The fact that the museum is free to enter makes this all the more one of London's hidden gems. Each room was well attended by staff who were clearly keen observers of patrons, safeguarding the works well, which is great to see.

All are carefully documented and labeled. I have to go back; this place is three floors and I only finished two rooms!

I found the lack of signs/labels next to many of the artefacts difficult to manage especially as the only way of finding out about them was through referring to one of two books on lecterns in each room. The content of each book varied and was not at a convenient height for wheelchair users or the vertically challenged! My other disappointment was when in a very beautiful room an alarm went off and staff came running only to find an embarrassed partially sighted visitor who explained that the artefact she was looking at high up above her head on a mantelpiece had a label that she could not read because of its height, she had taken it down and so had inadvertently tripped the alarm. Staff were very abrupt with her and took the label away from her to replace on the mantelpiece rather than let her finish reading it. She was clearly embarrassed and turned to explain her sight difficulties to me. The splendid new caf\u00e9 had staff who had problems finding the hot chocolate drink they had on the menu but once found I was kindly offered a complimentary one. A plus was the staff in the room where I had specifically headed for who went to great lengths to find the artefact I was looking for.Such a beautiful building and its wonderful contents needs to have all staff equal to it and facilities that anyone can use."

The Picture Room stands out on the first floor : The laughing Cavalier and Fragonard's The Swing stand out in particular. Downstairs you can wander around the rooms viewing historic antique furniture, pictures galore and the ever auditory presence of ticking clocks. It is pure peace from the hustle and bustle of Oxford St and as with many of London galleries and museums it's free! In recent years the central courtyard has been covered with glass and whilst surrounded by palms and peace, waiters and waitresses will serve you. This museum/ art gallery is often overlooked. It shouldn't be."

The Wallace Collection not only boasts an eclectic and delightful art collection, beautifully displayed in the recently renovated ( by the looks of it at least!) rooms, but also a Cafe and Restaurant set in the light and elegant atrium area. The restaurant serves excellent food ( about \u00a330 for two/ three courses, or Afternoon Tea English style).The cafe is a more price friendly, but equally appetising, choice. Even on a grey London day the atrium feels light and inviting. A favourite refuge of mine in London. Both for the art and the cafe."

The combination of the quality and range of the holdings and the impressiveness of Hertford House itself makes a visit to the Wallace Collection particularly rewarding. Because admission is free, it is possible to return at leisure a number of times until one has really got to know the collection well. It's looking particularly spectacular at the moment, some of the rooms having recently undergone restoration, particularly the largest gallery (home to Hals's \"The Laughing Cavalier\" and Poussin's \"A Dance to the Music of Time,\" which provided Anthony Powell with the title for his novel sequence). The whole experience provides fascinating insight into the power and wealth of the private collector in the 18th and 19th centuries: the good fortune of the collection's having survived in tact as a gift to the nation -- with little added, except relevant ancillary archival material, and nothing sold off -- gives it a particular historical unity and significance. A small exhibit in the basement provides a very interesting survey of the family responsible for its creation. There is a handsome, once open now glass-roofed, inner courtyard where (quite expensive) meals and snacks are served, sometimes rather slowly, and a more than averagely creative gift shop. Given a few of the earlier comments here, the staff seem to have undergone attitudinal refurbishment along with the house: they have been uniformly pleasant and helpful in my recent experience of them. In short, this is one of the most satisfying gallery experiences to be had in London or anywhere else."

The highlight is undoubtedly the deservedly well-known 'Laughing Cavalier' by Frans Hals - whose rogueish glint is so well captured by the artist. There are also a couple of good Rembrandts and Van Dycks, among the other worthwhile works.Because there are so many paintings, in many rooms they are hung two or three high on the walls; fortunately, many of these don't deserve very careful inspection - undistinguished landscapes, mythical scenes or hunting still lives - dead hares and pheasants, etc. Otherwise, I was most impressed with a number of beautiful polished marble tops - natural, except for a brilliant piece of work in the Venice/Canaletto room where a sort of stone marquetry technique has been used to create three pastoral pictures from different coloured stones - the first time I've seen anything like it. Superb!"

It houses the collection accumulated by one family in a building which was once one of their homes. The collection was given to the nation many years ago and is certainly varied. There are paintings, miniatures, furniture and pottery from the 15th to the 19th centuries. While I enjoyed the ground floor I preferred the upper floor, on which can be found The Laughing Cavalier and many works by Watteau, Fragonard and Rembrandt. Returning to the ground floor I found the displays of armour rather depressing, if impressive. Although small, the layout of the building is a little confusing, and I would recommend you buy the guide book, which includes a plan (with rather small print), and perhaps leave the change as a donation. If you need some refreshment there is a well-regarded restaurant, but I did not try it on this occasion. Well worth a visit of an hour to two hours. One of the great things about it is that it is much quieter than many London galleries, and you can take your time to enjoy whatever pleases you."

It has hundreds of items of furniture, paintings, sculptures and ceramics and a really amazing collection of arms and armour from all over the world. The breadth of the collection means that anyone with even the slightest interest in the history of art or arms or social history will find themselves wanting to spend more time than they have available. It contains the originals of many works of art that you will have seen before in reproduction, for example Frans Hals' 'Laughing Cavalier'."

Nothing has been added or changed at the original owner's request and the collection is available for free entry. What a deal! Hertford House, home of the collection, is an absolutely massive property. At the front door an employee told me I had to check my backpack (free). A tour would be starting in half an hour if we were interested but that would likely take a very long time and we only had an hour. I knew this place was huge and that wouldn't be near enough time to see everything but I was determined to try. We started out by going right from the lobby and heading into the first room of sculptures, carvings, coins, and paintings. I am sure each room had a theme or time period represented but we were not paying enough attention in our rush to get through. There were more historical items on the first floor and up a flight of stairs I found several large art galleries. The rooms themselves were also extremely grand. The largest gallery was big enough for double-stacked paintings or ones as tall as fifteen feet. The art was fantastic and so was the furniture in the house. With the exception of the occasional chair or bench for visitors there was rare furniture in each room with signs saying \u201cplease do not sit on the art\u201d. In addition to chairs there were couches, grandfather clocks, tables, vases, and a couple fantastic 17th Century armoires. On the second floor there was an interesting sun porch that didn\u2019t really fit the rest of the house. It was a different color pallet than the bold colors of the rest of the house and there were palmy plants everywhere. It was like a cabana. Maybe Lady Wallace went on a trip to Cuba at some point and tried to bring it back with her.Back on the first floor the last few rooms were the armor and weaponry collection (because why not, they were rich). There were thousands of weapons including axes, spears, swords, crossbows, pistols, rifles, shotguns, and a cannon. A lot of the weapons were both pretty and deadly. Many of the pistols and rifles, for example, had ivory handles with painted designs. The spears were probably more useful for ceremonial or gift-giving purposes than killing simply because of their carved and/or sculpted handles. The armor displays were also expansive and ranging from plain plate armor to super-intricate ceremonial armor. A couple shields were basically beautiful paintings that just happened to be on shields. A courtyard at the center of the building has a large cafe (we didn't have time). It is covered with a glass roof now but it would have been a nice outdoor escape in the center of the building when the Wallace\u2019s lived there. The bathroom was under the cafe in the courtyard. Each stall was unisex and enclosed with a full door and sink. I really like the European system of public restrooms. They\u2019re not all as nice, of course, but it\u2019s great to have privacy. Even the hallway outside the bathrooms had art displayed. At the bottom of the stairs near the bathrooms there were more art galleries (yes more, I couldn\u2019t believe it either) and a studio for making new art (presumably for artists flocking to the Wallace Collection for inspiration). There were a lot of books for sale in the gift shop but not much else in the way of souvenirs.Visit the Wallace Collection and try to set aside more time for it than we had available!"

We spent a good two hours here as there is so much to see. The nice thing is that the collction is very eclectic within a museum that is a manageable size. The highlights are the arms and armour, sevres porcelain, Canaletto paintings and numerous other paintings by the great masters of the 17th and 18th centuries. The Sainsbury Gallery - first floor rear has just been re-opened after a substantial refurbishment so the space has changed considerably to show the paintings off better. Don't miss the small exhibitions in the basement. Probably eat elsewhere as the restaurant looks as though it is overpriced.Wheelchairs and pushchairs appear to be allowed and there is a lift to all floors."

The Wallace Collection is a fantastic collection of mostly European decorative arts from around the Renaissance and slightly later, and some eastern weapons in the armory, with superb and comprehensive collections of several categories. Well presented and arranged. A few paintings by masters as well. The armor collection is a little disappointing for medieval enthusiasts but if you're into the decorative, it's the place to be. Clean and accessible. Highly recommended, great gift shop and a wonderful little caf\u00e9 with good prices (high tea starts at 2:30, plan accordingly!). Admission is free but please donate!"

The Wallace House has the most amazing collection of Art, Porcelain & Armour among many other items that I've seen in any museum. The guided tours they hold are great or you can just wander around the mansion by yourself. I have been back to The Wallace so many times now & each time I find something new. Its a little hidden gem in Manchester Square which is roughly 2 blocks behind Selfridges, but well worth the effort. The nearest tube stop is Bond St & about 10 minute walk from there. If your in London & want something a bit different to do that is free... then The Wallace is for you!!!"

I wanted to view some paintings to round out my very short London visit but was too tired to go cross town to National Gallery. This gem of a private collection was very near the hotel and completely absorbed my attention for two hours. There were beautiful portraits, including a Rembrandt of his son, and numerous allegorical scenes, dutch/Flemish works, illuminated manuscripts, decorative arts, and rooms of armor and weapons. The educational materials are adequate, with an audio tour that discusses some of the objects, and in each room a more extensive reference discussing each painting and object. \"It is probably best known for its paintings by artists such as Titian, Rembrandt, Hals (The Laughing Cavalier) and Vel\u00e1zquez and for its superb collections of eighteenth-century French paintings, porcelain, furniture and gold boxes, probably the best to be found anywhere outside France. Less well known is that the Wallace Collection features one of the finest groups of princely arms and armour in Europe and, alongside this, you can enjoy splendid medieval and Renaissance objects, including Limoges enamels, maiolica, glass and bronzes.\""

Sadly I suppose many others do not realise until word spreads as plenty of spare capacity. Yet the pricing of a two course or three course meal was very reasonable for the location and the actual dishes were fine cuisine with superb presentation. Wine and drinks are available and our group dined really well without breaking the bank. I believe the chef is newly appointed and I trust word passes around to keep the enterprise viable, we would certainly return and soon. If I had one reservation it was that although the waiting staff were generally amenable and did a lot well, it always irks me if a group had orders taken systematically that when the course is served it is not placed directly to your place but the meal is called out. The food outweighed that criticism all the same."

Leave the shops and enrich your minds with this collection of art, armour and artisan - all free.With new exhibits held regularly, this collection never fails to amaze and there is always something for the younger children including holiday activities and fun activity pack for them to complete.This is also one place where the refurbishment has improved the exhibits and enhanced the overall display by adding more space and improving some of the previously tired decor. The Wallace restaurant in the central courtyard is also a touch of luxury in palatial surroundings - a great place for a romantic meal or a family treat. As a Londoner, the beauty of the collection being free is that you can take the family again and again to focus on different parts of the collection and absorb it in more detail. There are fun rooms in the museum where the children can try on costumes from the past and enjoy interacting with some of the exhibits. In addition the galleries are a cultural treat but some younger children might find this challenging to get round, although sometimes they have special activities to encourage children to engage with the art. It is a reasonably sized place if you don't want to traipse for miles around one of the bigger museums and usually less crowded - a best kept secret - just minutes from Oxford street. A wonderful gem of a place."

This is one of the finest collections of French art, furniture and ceramics in the world. You can further see some incredible works by Dutch and Italian Old Masters and an impressive armoury collection at the the historic Hereford House, where the Wallace Collection is held. We recommend taking one of the free tours given here each day by volunteers. They do a nice job of explaining the history of the collection and how it was accumulated by Richard Seymour-Conway in the 19th century, before being passed on to his illegitimate son, Richard Wallace and later bequeath to the nation by Lady Wallace. Tours walk you through the various rooms, showing the collection highlights, which include rare ceramics and furniture from Versailles as well as a wonderful assortment of paintings by the likes of Boucher, Fragonard, Decamps, Poussin, Watteau, de Houch, Hals, Rubens, Rembrandt, Van Dyke, Canaletto, Titian, Vel\u00e0zquez and others. The paintings alone rival any small art collection in the world. In the end, this is an attraction that art lovers will simply not want to miss when visiting London and we highly recommend the free tours which we believe to improve the overall experience one can have of visits to the Wallace Collection."

Even though I've been to most of the museums in London somehow I had always missed the Wallace Collection, maybe because it is sort of off the beaten track tucked away on a side street of Baker Street. i was fortunate during my visit that I happened to arrive right when the free tour commenced (1130 in my case). I would highly recommend this. The free tour is comparable to what you have to pay elsewhere, and gives you an exhaustingly complete history of the collection and highlights of the display.I was utterly unprepared for the sheer enormity of the collection and left after several hours feeling like I must have missed half of it. Best thing about the museum is that it isn't crowded and nothing is roped off - you can get right in front of the artwork if you want, although I'm sure an alarm would go off at some point!Simply amazing collection and not to be missed. I even liked the ground floor restoration exhibit that many advise to skip."

However long you spend there, you will not be exhausted when you have finished, and you will be able to enjoy most of the wonderful exhibits.The restaurant is light, airy and expensive. It caters for vegetarians, but like so many places that profess to do so, it forgets those who do not eat eggs or non-vegetarian cheese.There is limited disabled parking (3 spaces), which should be booked in advance, and there is a lift to take you upstairs. Wheelchairs are also available to borrow, and there are very lightweight stools that you can easily carry around.Weekdays it is usually fairly quiet, and even on weekends it does not get overcrowded."

Not only is this a cornucopia of different objects but includes great artwork and a fantastic armoury. The house itself is fantastic and on a beautiful square set back from the madness of Oxford St.Going in, I was aware that The Laughing Cavalier was the star attraction, but for me, the star of the show is the French art. I've often seen prints of Fragonard's The Swing, but until I saw it for real, had never realised how \"naughty\" it really is. That suitor really has chosen a prime location!!I spent several hours at the Collection and can thoroughly recommend a walk up to Charing Cross Rd along those back streets. Not only is it much quieter than Oxford St but there are beautiful quaint shops and fantastic little cafes."

There are many great paintings by the likes of Velazquez, Rubens, Poussin and Watteau, but also many space-fillers by less distinguished artists. And this is a must-visit museum for lovers of Sevres porcelain. The real stars are the rooms themselves, with their extravagant decorations, which are well worth seeing. Personally, if I only had time to visit five museums / collections in London this would not be one of them, but it would be in my top ten."

The hostess was very pleasant, but the servers either ignored me or promised they'd bring whatever I'd been waiting ages for -- and then left me waiting again. Even getting a glass of tap water took nearly a half hour. After I waited 45 minutes for dessert (the tarte tatin), the waiter admitted it had been burned. The hostess immediately asked if she could substitute something else - but the waiter should have figured this out much earlier.Finally, with less than two hours until the museum closed at 5 p.m., I left the restaurant and headed to the museum's entrance where I purchased the audio guide. The guy selling the audio explained that the \"masters\" tour (promoted on the museum's web site) had been replaced by a much more efficient tour. Instead of listening to an entire long description, visitors could simply key in the number displayed next to the work of art. As I meandered to the upper level to start (as directed) I discovered that hardly any of the displayed works were covered in the audio guide. One room, crowded with lots of small works on every wall, didn't have a single audio description. Other rooms had only one or two descriptions. The descriptions themselves were quite good, running a couple of minutes each - but there were surprisingly few. Besides that, some of the numbers were incorrect and others didn't work because they were part of \"the family tour.\" When I pointed out these problems to the audio guide guy, he initially denied it. So I showed him a nearby painting with an erroneous number. He conceded I was right and said he'd \"pass the information along.\" No mention was made of refunding me the fee for the audio rental. (There is no entrance fee for the museum.) I had the impression that both in the restaurant and in the museum no one really cared much about the visitor's experience. (Well, the restaurant hostess seemed to care, but you can't expect her to do everything.)The museum is jam-packed with artwork, but I'm not an art historian, and consequently I rely on audio descriptions to make the most of my visit. The skimpy audio tour combined with my lunchtime restaurant experience left me wishing I'd spent the afternoon elsewhere."

That's right if the lovely ladies of Downton Abbey we're going to London I'm sure they'd be staying in a place just like this which used to be the London town home to a very wealthy family.They had amassed a huge art collection and when the husband died the wife left the collection to the city of London with the stipulation that the whole collection must stay in one place and can never be on the loan so all the paintings are there all the time and also their collection of fine furniture statuary porcelain and other numerous items.There are so many paintings most of them well known so you will need several hours to take this all in and the best part ,Yep it's all free ! Of course a donation of your choosing is well appreciated.Also there is a lovely restaurant in the middle courtyard where you can luncheon , have a drink,or a spot of tea.And though you may feel the urge to go in your finest silks,gloves and finery ,they will take you as you are !!"

Staff were welcoming but it doesn't seem the sort of place that would permit relaxation. This theme carries through to the galleries: staff here were snooty. We were made to feel like a threat to the exhibits. I was ticked off by one who came across like a headmistress scolding a schoolboy. This was for holding a rucksack, something one of her colleagues had just suggested I do instead of wearing it on my back.Don't be put off though.

Started as a private collection, it was donated to public and is available free of charge to everyone with a condition to preserve and maintain. It should be emphasized that currently not a single piece of exhibition could be taken out, so, it is solid as stone combining masterpieces of XV-XIX centuries with original interiors.If you are tired of huge and crowded museums where you're lost and confused after 20+ rooms representing thousands of pieces, Wallace collection is a right choice. It was collected with love and taste and preserved carefully. Without a single sign of redundancy, this exhibition will allow to to enjoy the very best masterpieces of art and miniature drawings (mainly French) wisely diluted by porcelain, armors and furniture. If I am allowed to say so, Wallace collection is resembling the best from Victoria and Albert, virtually a concentrate where all water and waste are thrown apart to supply you with the best sensual experience you may search for.This is an excellent place to visit anyway, but if you are limited in time and want to get best from the time available, go directly to Wallace. Yet, if you have enough time to rest, don't miss a cozy (but pricy) cafe in the very centre of the building where you can spend your lazy half-an-hour with a glass of wine and recent impressions."

As \"la Wallace\" is the no. 1 London attraction in the French Guide Michelin, the French weekend invasion begins on Friday evening, so mid-week viewing is strongly recommended."

The collection itself is quite extensive, and if you like porcelain they have the worlds largest display of Sevres outside of France. The collection assigned a very knowledgable woman who took us around (free of charge) and it gave life to the works that otherwise would go unnoticed. I would recommend a visit to the Wallace Collection, as well as the shops and cafes in the Marlybone area on a Saturday afternoon."

You lift a leather cloth to reveal the treasures below. There are famous paintings such as Frans Hal's famous 'Laughing Cavalier' and Rembrandt's self-portrait along with Fragonard's The Swing. Also Reynolds and Gainsborough portraits of famous beauties. So many treasures in such a beautiful house.

Each room has a leaflet with details of its treasures and information as to its purpose when it was a home. There is a small shop although the girl serving could do learn some customer service (chatting away to a colleague and disinterested attitude) and a lovely looking restaurant outside which stays open for dinner on a Fri / Sat. Free admission (donations welcomed of course) with friendly, knowledgeable staff. Open daily from 10:00-17:00 (except 24-26 Dec) and photography allowed (no flash).

If you have a Saturday afternoon to while away and you are someone who likes a relaxed, refined atmosphere in which to admire some absolutely jaw-droppingly smashing art, the Wallace Collection at Hertford House is for you.I hesitated to write a review because this was one experience I didn't really want to share! In the first place they have a lovely restaurant and cafe, very good food. They even let us have our champagne afternoon tea at the wrong time (lunch), yes i know, not very refined of ME, but shows how flexible and professional the service is. As for the art, well, it's not just the art, this is indeed a collection. The house itself is the framework; each room demonstrates a theme, and each theme is executed exquisitely well. Please, take the time to admire the furniture and soft furnishings. Take the time to imagine how people lived in the period. This is not a place in which to go rushing by. One caveat would be to bear in mind that most of it is 17th- 18th century European work, which I am personally rather partial to. I would certainly want to visit this place again."

The quality varies a lot, there are some fantastic paintings like one by Frans Hals, but overall the collection has too many french and italian paintings from the 17th century, aka boring. Overall if you like paintings from that era you will like it, but other museums are more worthwhile in london. The opening time at 10m is too late for my taste but i canno complain because it is free."

Every city has one heart-stoppingly great museum that only the locals seem to know...and love. In London, it's the Wallace Collection, magnificent collection of seventeenth century art, furniture, etc. together with the best, most accessible collection of arms and armor I've seen. The house is constantly (but unobtrusively) being improved, and the garden restaurant is a quiet oasis for tea or whatever. Quite wildly underappreciated; not to be missed."

It was worth the trip to see it. The rest of the collection is not really to my taste but was well laid out. The staff were helpful. The gift shop is one of the most comical I have been in. There are loads of tacky souvenirs. For people who enjoy art of this period it would be great, think little old ladies. If you are one, go for it!"

It also has a just wonderful cafe right in a middle attrium. I just can't say enough about this place if you are into historical collections. They have personal belongings to such famous people as Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. They have some of the most famous paintings including Rembrandts, Fragonards, Gainsboroughts and more. Just a lot more than that, too - too much to go into. One thing I would caution, however - if you can take it in in 2 days instead of one, I would do that. A good alternate would be to get there in mid-morning, see half of it, eat lunch in their cafe, and then see the rest. It is like eating 10 rich chocolate cakes all at once, if you know what I mean. We took over 3 hours to see it and could have been there longer if we weren't so tired. This is longer than we spent in the British museum or the National Gallery. The rooms have lots of places to sit down and that helped (we're in our late 60's). Also, not crowded (although we went on a weekday). This is a first class attraction and I hightly recomment it. By the way, if you walk there using a map like I did, it is easy to walk right by it.

I am so glad we did it: Wallace collection has it all: wonderful paintings, collection of the most elaborate china and miniatures, and fantastic furnishing. You can also enjoy their spectacular collection of world class armor, both European and Oriental. The rooms decor is fabulous: no words to describe how elegant and ornate the design is.

Allow at least 1/2 day if possible, and better still, book onto one of the escourted tours. The staff are wonderful- passionately supportive of their collection, even promoting the private hire of the venue for corporate events (as the government funding has been cut back, and entry is free). Do make a donation. We went at a time when the great gallery is closed for refurbishment until late August; however they have shoe-horned most of the art (but not all of the military collection of guns and armour) into the other rooms.This means sometimes the highlight pictures are not where you expect according to the prinited guide. Go early and book on the 11:30 or 2:30 walking tour- these take a little over an hour. We only saw a small fraction of the exhibits on the walk, but you learn the history so much better with a guide. We ate at the restaurant which is part of a group who supply the British Museum amongst others and the food is great- perfect setting in the newly glass roofed- atrium, great space between tables, good service, very acceptable food; not cheap, but then we find London and other major cities more expensive than provincial restaurants- soak up the location, make time to enjoy the food and wine and make it part of the trip (or just grab a snack if you treat teh food as fuel or don't have the time) . If we had the kids with us i would perhaps think twice about the cost, but since entry is free and should say be \u00a315 each (at least) then look at it as a saving towards the meal, perhaps. Anyway back to the exhibits- other than the pictures, there is wonderful porcelain, furniture and a very impessive collection of armour and weapons over they years, so this should be a wide enough range of items to keep most people happy. We are so lucky this was given to the Nation (with a condition it cannot be loaned, or added to, which is very unusual)."

The collection is displayed in a very large, historic house that is less than 5 minutes walk from Selfridges on Oxford Street. If you feel like mixing retail therapy and culture this is a great place to visit. As it is free to enter one can just drop in for a short while. There are a wide variety of things to see: many interesting paintings including some famous ones such as -'The Laughing Cavalier', Fragonard's 'The Swing', a 'Self Portrait' by Rembrandt and paintings by Reynolds. There is a good collection of Sevres Porcelain items, arms & armour, some furniture and the house itself is an interesting building.There is a pleasant gift shop, lift to all floors, very clean toilets and an attractive courtyard restaurant. Note - this is not a self service caf\u00e9 but a proper restaurant with waiter/waitress servers. One can buy breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and on Friday & Saturday evening meals too- it's not the cheapest of places but is very nice indeed. However, as one is so close to Oxford Street one can find plenty of alternative eating venues if this restaurant does not suit you.Currently, the great gallery is being restored (I believe it will reopen in September) but there is still a great deal to see and the most famous paintings have been rehoused in other parts of the building whilst work is in progress.This gallery does not contain modern works of art but if you enjoy looking at paintings that depict life in a more photographic way then you will find much to enjoy.Overall, this is one of my favourite galleries, I always enjoy my visits here."

The restaurant looks fabulous but as there was a queue we headed (unfortunately) elsewhere. This visit was part of a packed cultural visit and was a clear highlight of our week."

For those who need a break from Oxford Street mayhem .... direct your feet a short distance behind Selfridges to the Wallace Collection.The art works are, of course, the main reason to go here - they are splendid and varied. The bonus is the glass-covered courtyard where one can order high-class light meals and some pretty good wines as well. I often just drop in here to relax in the courtyard with a snack and a red wine - sometimes a champagne. I strongly recommend that you do the same!"

Set in an old manor house, each room is full of quality artworks and other collectables. It is certainly worth spending several hours here, but knowing what you are looking for or at helps a lot. The brochure (for sale in bookshop) titles Directors Choice is helpful in this regard. Each room is decorated in a style befitting the contents on display, we loved the Dutch Rooms (including several Rembrandts) and the Round Room. Entrance is free and there is a lovely coffee shop in the courtyard. It is near Bond St tube station. Only criticism is that it is probably too stuffed with items on display, making it slightly overwhelming to take it all in. But if you love privately collected antiques, this is the place to go. But it is not the Prado or British Portrait Gallery!"

This house was once the home of the Hertford family, based in both Paris and London, and the collection of treasures reflects this with paintings by Canaletto and Gainsborough and also Dutch paintings including The Laughing Cavalier. The house and collection was handed over to the nation in 1897. This priceless collection is housed in a beautiful building overlooking Manchester Square, just off Thayer street behind Selfridges. It is free to get in but a brochure is offered for \u00a35.99 and is good value. The collection is over 3 floors (and has lifts) and even includes a collection of Oriental armoury. Walk straight through from street level and you will enter the old courtyard garden, now covered by an Atrium roof, which is the restaurant. All types of tea, coffees, juice cocktails and a good wine selection is offered at good prices. Wines from \u00a34.50 a glass, salads from around \u00a38.50, hot meals or just a pot of tea is served by friendly liveried staff.

It could occupy your day if you looked at every item on display. For me the paintings were fabulous, Titian, Canaletto, Rembrandt , Gainsborough, it goes on. There were also other interesting items, furniture, sculptures, collection of armour and weapons and more.Added benefit there is a licensed restaurant so you can break you visit with a coffee, light snack or even a full meal if you wish."

Prepare yourself: this place is PACKED with a fantastic collection of porcelains, miniatures, an unbelievable array of medieval armaments form many cultures, paintings, furniture (getting the idea: packed). The space is relatively small, compared to the V & A or the National Gallery, but what an experience. Frankly, I began suffering from sensory overload after about an hour.

I was all but held hostage by my guest in the Armory collection, which is quite extensive and can take hours to tour if you buy the guide book at the door and stop to read the full history of every piece... not my cup of tea!But it was all worthwhile when we got to my little crumpet (and my only reason for the visit), Fragonard's \"The Swing\". I soaked it in for at least 20 minutes, and I continue to enjoy the memory 20 years later. I still have the fridge magnet on display that is a 2x3 miniature of the painting. And I still go back every few trips to refresh my memory!I was quite surprised to finally find it in Manchester Square, London. It would be more at home in Paris, but I can see it more often in London.If one doesn't insist upon examining the minutiae of the extensive armory, the art collection can be well-enjoyed in an hour. It's a wonderful quickie for the culture-vulture with a full itinerary, and the entrance fee won't make you Ba-Roque (I know: that was terrible.) Enjoy!"

Once I turned the corner, I was in a different world for there were few people or cars in this 18th century garden square in the Marylebone area.

There is no entrance fee (donations welcome) nor tour guides but you can hire an audio guide should you require more info. At the moment one of the larger galleries is shut for renovation. There is also a very nice cafe/restaurant situated in the inner courtyard although we did not take advantage of this.

The jewel in the crown (although many may dispute this) is undoubtedly the painting 'The Swing' by Fragonard - which inspired the art animation in Disney's 'Tangled', as well as making a cameo in animated form in Disney's Frozen. I visited with no expectations and was blown away by the quality of pieces in there, as well as the interiors of the mansion itself, and could not believe it was free entry. The restaurant also looks charming, as well as the private garden across the street which was lovely in full bloom. This is definitely a hidden gem in the heart of London and certainly underrated. If you are keen on viewing art by a range of masters, as well as having a peek at the interiors of a stately british home from a past era, this is for you.

It is on our list every time a friend comes in from out of town - we go 5-6 times a year. First, call and book a table for late lunch (2:15 or so) in the atrium courtyard. Even on on a cold day it feels summery. Hit the museum a bit in advance of the 1pm guided tour to have a quick browse, do the one hour tour - it is different every time depending upon the guide and what they feel like chatting about that day. Food is lovely, setting superb, then you can see more of the collection or move on. And if the men in the group are tired of pairings, it has of the greatest collections of arms and armour anywhere."

            "review": "Gem of London. I'm a New York City tour guide on vacation in London. The Frick Collection is my favorite museum in New York so naturally I always wanted to visit the Wallace Collection. The Wallace Collection is located in a fine manor home in Manchester Square. The Collection is free to enter and there are two tours of the highlights at 11:00'AM and 2:30 PM respectively. The Marquesses Hertford (pronounced like Hartford, Connecticut) spent five generations amassing the fine art, objet d'art, and furniture. The tour guide was superb. Imagine a social X-Ray in chic Chanel with a French accent appearing to be a curator at Sotheby's who volunteers her time at the Wallace Collection in an attempt to educate Philistines. She had more class in her pinky than I'll ever have. At one point after she casually discoursed on fine lacquer techniques I asked, \"Everything is so perfect and exquisite but the floors are rather plain. Were they added later in a renovation by the conservators?\" I stumped her but an assistant came forward with books showing originally there was a lot of carpeting. Then the patient guide went on to illustrate some delicate craftsmanship on a secretary. Another American stepped up behind me and whispered, \"Thanks for asking. We were wondering what's up with the floors too.\" Photos without flash or click are allowed! Bring those I-Phones. If you love French Art and furniture design with an emphasis on Rococo and French Regency this place is for you. Kids will be bored to death. This is probably not a family visit. I used the Central Line (red) to Bond Street. Walk about four blocks west on Oxford Street and make a right turn up Duke Street. It's a five minute walk to Manchester Sq."

The paintings are worth the journey and if you are lover of all things gold, as well as the rococo movement then you best come see these exquisite pieces. Artists of all walk should appear, but be warned stay away from the staff as they are notoriously pretentious, rude and fairly ignorant in terms of their actual job. Most take a rather snobbish approach to the concept of tourists and basic civil pleasantries as I heard one member of staff scolding an elderly lady about her walking stick and that she should probably check it the coatroom when it is quite obvious this women was simply using as the crutch it is and she would have been unable to tour the building without it. A great collection that should score higher, but staff do indeed make the difference."

We said fair enough and went for a walk around the building on our own. As it was a warm day and I was thirsty from walking around, I had a bottle of juice that I took out of my bag. Immediately I was approached by one of the staff members saying \"Excuse me! What are you drinking?\" In a loud voice and made me show him the bottle only to say that no soft drinks are allowed inside the house. I did not feel welcome on my first trip to the Wallace Collection, and although the building and it's interior is fairly impressive I wouldn't recommend anybody to go."

Not a huge amount of any of them compared to places such as the V&A or national gallery, but its good to have the mixture within a relatively compact building. In each room there are leaflets/folders containing a few pages of commentary/guidance which helped explain the exhibits. I particularly liked the horse armour, and the bronze frieze (in the basement). Now I want to go back for a longer visit with my wife, to try a guided tour and perhaps sample the cafe food and drink."

I have to say however that the rest of the staff we encountered were all very pleasant and courteous, and if it hadn't been for the ill-mannered invigilator I would have scored the experience a 5 out of 5.

The Wallace Collection is one of the world's finest small museums, with an outstanding assortment of art treasures from the 15th to 19th centuries, housed in the historic Hertford House. Here you can see truly wonderful artworks, an exquisite holding of 18th century French paintings, furniture and armour as well as a large holding of Old Master paintings. The majority of the Wallace Collection treasures was accumulated by Richard Seymour-Conway, who left the entire house and its contents to his illegitimate son Sir Richard Wallace, for which this museum takes it name. In 1897, Lady Wallace then bequeathed the property and art collection to the nation, with the simple conditions that the collection be left as it was, nothing added or removed, even on temporary loan. At that time, this was considered the single greatest bequest of art treasure to the nation. The museum was opened to the public in 1900 and has been free to visit since that time. We recently visited the Wallace Collection and participated in one of their free tours. This was an absolute treat. In addition to the remarkably items seen throughout the building galleries, we were treated to a rich history lesson about Mr Richard Seymour-Conway and how he acquired the many items, the stewardship of Sir Richard and Lady Wallace and how the collection came to be bequeathed to the nation. This was a marvellous lesson and highly recommendable experience for anyone with an appreciation for fine art and museum visits. Unfortunately the Great Gallery where Old Master collection is found is presently closed for much needed refurbishments. It is scheduled to reopen sometime in 2014, much to the delight of future visitors of the museum. Many of the works of art normally shown here have been redistributed through the museum so that you can enjoy them. Hint: There is a small gift shop where you can pick up a souvenir or art book. There is also a courtyard restaurant if you are interested in having a rest for food and drink. Tip: The Wallace Collection has a well designed website that provides information about the property and history of the collection. You can also find details about the galleries and treasures on display at the Hereford House."

Rembrandts, Gainsboroughs, Rubens and so many more priceless paintings, sculptures and artifacts in a very special museum in a home setting. The home itself is an exquisite place reminiscent of Downton Abbey opulence and style. You must see the Wallace Collection. It is possible to simple visit for an hour or so to get a taste of this very special place."

Amazing collections which includes: pictures and miniatures from different eras; armours which belongs to Medieval times to Islamic and Chinese times; furniture that is a work of art; sculptures; colourful handmade ceramics and works of art like jewelery boxes. It is exquisite! Make sure you eat properly because you will need all the energy you have to wander around the place. It would take 2-3 hours to actually enjoy every little detail there. Get off Bond Street tube station and walk to it, takes around 10 minutes. It is truly a hidden gem and I highly recommend it."

This is a lovely, free, attraction situated on Manchester Square, just behind Selfridges on Oxford Street.Compared with the Kensington Museums and the National/ Tate galleries, this is very bijou....but the artifacts are displayed beautifully, intelligently and one can drift from room to wonderful room. In truth one could do justice to the whole building in a couple of hours....but, if you were to look closely under the covers, or have a specific interest in say porcelain or jewel boxes, you could easily spend all day there. You don't need the stamina of a Roman legionary to walk round...it is small and intimate..personally, I love graphic art, so for me the highlights were the Gainsboroughs, Fragonard, Rembrandt and, the start of the show, Fras Hals' Laughing cavalier.Although I have some reservations about the cafe/ restaurant (I have commented separately) its location is delightful and for a quick cuppa and cake/ snack (not a full meal!!) it is worth a visit.I have awarded four stars as not all the rooms were open....but I'll be visiting later this year and know I will again be thrilled by this hidden gem."

I find it interesting that most of the other reviews are along the lines of: 'it's great! it's wonderful! you'll love it!' My take on it is: well, you MIGHT love it - but only if your taste runs to 18th century French rococo - or is it baroque? (can never keep those 2 straight). In any event, keep in mind that this is, strictly speaking, the Wallace 'Collection', not the 'Museum': it's what one family liked to collect... and what they liked was lots of Sevres porcelain, those little spindly chairs, tables with lots of marquetry and chests and armoires heaped out the wazoo with that gilded stuff.The art collection also veers heavily to the 18th century, but you will see some great Van Dycks and Rembrandts, as well as English painters of the century, including some lovely portraits by the usual suspects: Reynolds, etc. Guided tours are given regularly, and do an excellent job of putting the collection in context and giving an appreciation for some of the objects you might otherwise overlook.For those who are not particular fans of the rococo/baroque, you might still be enchanted by their outdoor restaurant/tea room. The space is covered in glass - you have the wonderful pleasure of sitting outside in the middle of winter. Great for afternoon tea, particularly if you are weary from Oxford Street shopping. (note though, that the restaurant closes at @ 4;30, so best not to leave your tea drinking until too late).As others have noted, this is an incredibly tranquil spot, just a short 5 minute walk from the Bond St. tube and the hurly-burly shopping area. It is well worth a visit, even a short one, (easy to drop in/out because it is free) and gives you the feeling of knowing about a secret hideaway."

Personally, I think it's best to explore alone and at your own pace (especially if you're like me and always have your sketchbook handy). Besides the hundreds of beautiful items and paintings, the house is an attraction in itself.

Interestingly NASA came to this museum to study the joints on the various different types of armour, through the centuries, to get ides for how to build the (knee, elbow, neck, etc) joints on their space suits. They also have the Laughing Cavalier painting here, which is something I had seen copied in advertising and in popular culture but had never seen the original.

A wonderful haven near the bustle of Oxford Street."

It is housed in the owner's home, a quick walk from the Marble Arch tube station. The collection is varied and eclectic; for me, that kept me from experiencing museum fatigue. The highlights were the armor, Marie Antoinette's items, the Dutch paintings and the guns. The fact that you get to walk through the rooms of the house was interesting as well. There is also a small, but lovely gift shop."

Paintings, porcelain, sculpture, furniture, armour, swords, weapons - this is an amazing cornucopia of treasures all amassed one collector family. The Wallace Collection is five minute's walk from Selfridges and yet worlds away from Oxford Street. If you're local (and because it's free) it's easy to pop in for a few minutes from day to day, to take in another room of delights. The shop has excellent 'different' gifts and souvenirs. There is also a lovely atrium restaurant/bistro which is very popular - booking is advised."

As well as the paintings, there is a fine collection of furniture, armour and porcelain. It is hard to believe that one family, the Hertfords, collected all of these treasures.Yes, it is free, but you don't mind making a contribution. The Frick Collection in New York, for which we were charged 16 dollars, isn't a patch on this collection. As already stated, there is a fine restaurant as well."

A very nice looking Cafe although I did not try it. The house itself is also quite spectacular.

There are rich displays mainly of French and English paintings, furniture, porcelain and tapestries, much of which dates from the 18th and 19th centuries. There are sculptures, busts and a large array of arms and armour. The overall effect is definitely rococo, with huge paintings, imposing staircases and many of the exhibits are unashamedly ornate. The museum runs a Treasure of the Month and there are special exhibitions such as The Male Nude, and Special Talks & Lectures. There are links with the Arts Fund and art classes for adults as well as family based activities. All in all a fascinating place, entry is free and it is very close to Oxford St."

Very easy to find, just two minutes walk from Oxford Street, in a beautiful building on Manchester Square. The collection is fascinating, with some recognisable paintings and beautiful pieces. I don't usually like armoury exhibitions, but this one is a must-see."

This is a magnificent private collection that was turned into a national museum according to the will of Sir Richard Wallace's French widow.You'll get items from the 15th till the 19th century, from paintings to armory displayed in several impressive rooms.Creations from Rembrandt, Canaletto among many other are on sight to be admired.The guided tour was very informative and helped us understanding a bit more of the collection itself and the social backstage that also led to it.During this last visit there was an interesting exhibition \"The male nude\"! Very interesting as you can see some different draws from the same model done at the same time by different painters. Different perspectives.The restaurant has a very trendy but traditional atmosphere but we weren't impressed by the service before or during seating down. Waiters chatting while we stood there, standing up, for several minutes, waiting to be seated didn't give us the best impression. We were expecting a lot more from the atmosphere and the prices. It's such a cozy patio that is a shame about the lack of attention to detail and customers.The shop is very nice and has a welcoming feeling. It's divided mostly by specialized books and special edition items and then there's another room with more of those items and commercial ones to match everybody's taste. It's ideal for Christmas shopping. I bought a nice piece of jewellery with \"The swing\" - inspired. What impressed me about this particular piece was the fact that is different from everything else being sold in other museum shops and the reasonable price. A find indeed!We cannot forget that places like this need to be conserved and rely on donations and sales from the shop. We are happy that our purchases helped to maintain this beautiful private collection.A place to return and enjoy, specially because some pieces are taken away for sometime and back again. the clocks are a good example of this. Some dozens are displayed and some are away to rest for ten years. This is a good way to conserve the pieces but also makes it more dynamic and interesting as you can see different things in different visits."

On the last morning of a recent visit to London, my wife and I decided to squeeze in a visit to the Wallace Collection, a national museum in the heart of London, because of its proximity to our hotel. We found ourselves overwhelmed with the sheer volume and quality of the Collection, which includes a massive arms and armor collection and room after room of paintings by Rembrandt, Hals, Vel\u00e1zquez, and Canaletto (a newly acquired taste), among others, S\u00e8vres porcelain and other exquisite ceramics, and wonderfully preserved and ornate furnishings. We staggered out after little more than an hour, happy but unable to absorb any more in such a short visit.Visitors should plan to take a break from viewing the Collection by visiting the spacious and airy restaurant in the covered central courtyard of the Collection's townhouse. Prices were reasonable, and a pause for brunch or a drink is almost essential to give yourselves time to absorb what you are seeing. The National Gallery might attract more attention, but the Wallace Collection is not to be missed."

Returned here recently after a 15 year gap,to refresh the memory, and was not disappointed. It is a large collection but including acres of less popular, less fashionable material like old furniture, china, armour (Oriental and European!) and of course muskets. So not a lot of paintings and many of the paintings are relatively obscure. But... this is exactly why it pays delving, for art that is less obvious and available. There are some standout paintings like Franz Hals, and others, like Velazquez and Bronzino. But there is the marvellous collection of miniature paintings, many of historic people, and the china and porcelain, even some of the weaponry, especially that decorated minutely. Also the collection is generally not crowded, has an other wordly ambience, and a good cafe in the central atrium."

I have also looked with interest at the collection of famous Italian maiolica from Urbino, Deruta, Gubbio, Pesaro and Faenza. In addition to the famous painting The Artist's Son Titus by Rembrandt, there is a rich collection of paintings by Boucher, Canaletto, Delacroix, Delaroche, Greuze, Rubens, Rembrandt, Steen, Tiziano and Turner to cite just few examples. Each room is enriched with beautiful furniture coming especially from France. Close to the shop there is the beautiful Oriental Armoury room with rare Indo Persian swords and arms. Here I could admire the treasure of the month, a small but precious Mughal dagger, an oriental object enriched with beautiful gems.A bright courtyard hosts a charming tearoom.The museum is open every day from 10am to 5pm and admission is free."

The Wallace Collection is a museum in London, with a world-famous range of fine and decorative arts from the 15th to the 19th centuries with large holdings of French 18th-century paintings, furniture, arms & armour, porcelain and Old Master paintings arranged into 25 galleries.Many of the paintings are by famous artists - Rembrandt, Rubens, Boucher to name a couple. Very tastefully done. This 'home' was established in 1897 from the private collection mainly created by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford (1800\u20131870), who left it and the house to his illegitimate son Sir Richard Wallace (1818\u20131890), whose widow bequeathed the entire collection to the nation.It is a couple of blocks behind Selfridges. In the center of the courtyard is a lovely French restaurant. Take a couple of hours here rather than the bigger museums. Less crowded and friendly guards ready to answer any question or spend a few minutes discussing the collection."

Having been told by an ex-pat friend that the Wallace Collection was by far her favorite London museum, I was pleased when with the rain pouring down we found ourselves inside the gorgeous building and grounds off Manchester Square. It does not rival the National Gallery or V&A in size, but the content would equal (and in some cases surpass) any fine arts museum in the world. It is a carefully curated collection with many pieces sure to be recognized. Fine examples of objets d'arts from around the world are displayed in rooms of true grandeur. In many instances, the architecture and design of many of the rooms and hallways overshadows the displays, or at the very least, vies for your rapt attention. This is a sophisticated collection, deftly arranged and very pleasing to the eye. The lack of heavy crowds makes the browsing even more delightful. So, don't tell anyone else, but make your way to the Wallace Collection and delight your senses and expand your world."

It doesn't seem overcrowded like the British Museum, does not suffer from the stuffy atmosphere that plagues so many other museums and the visitor has a true feeling of being really appreciated. The collection, which mainly has been acquired in France is amazing and ranges from medieval to late 18th century. They have an extensive display of medieval armors, rare paintings, clocks and various precious furnitures.I was truly impressed by the Venetian landscapes and the way artifacts are presented with wall tapestry of different color for each room.Food is served in a beautiful large veranda inside the building.

We enjoyed our visit to the Wallace Collection, as much for its eccentricity and excess, as for the huge number of artworks and furnishings crammed into the residence. Entry is free, but they encourage you to buy a guidebook as a 'donation', which is fair enough. We began our visit by having lunch in the open air restaurant in the courtyard. The setting was wonderful but the service was very poor and a number of people around us just gave up and left before their orders were even taken, based on the fact that you might well wait for ever. There is a snootiness among the staff in some English eating establishments that takes some beating, and such was the case here, which was a pity. The food was also only very average, despite the prices. The collection itself was remarkable and included a couple of real gems such as Franz Hals's \"The Laughing Cavalier\". Amazing to come across a masterpiece like this in a private residence. We always enjoy the limitations of a private collection - not too much to take in all at once (e.g. the Villa Borghese in Rome and the Frick in New York). The fact that the Wallace Collection was given for the public to enjoy was a wonderful gesture and we were certainly glad we saw it. However, it IS excessive in its opulence and you had the feeling it was almost collecting for collecting's sake. Nevertheless, definitely worth a visit - and so near to Oxford St."

Awe inspiring the moment we walked up to the home, wonderful docent/tour guide and had a thoroughly delightful afternoon that we both agreed was the highlight of our 5 day London trip. Outstanding array or Art---Hals, Boucher, Rembrant, Gorgeous china---amazing Armour collection--second only in the UK to the Tower. Would recommend this outting for anyone!!"

You have a two hour afternoon tea sitting - what that means is you drink tea/champagne for 1hr and only then do they start to bring out the goodies (scones were a little overdone but tasted good). Lots of tea top ups throughout, which is wonderful until they rush you out and refuse to let you use the toilet and are remarkably rude about it - \"but we've just drank tea continuously for the past 2hrs\"...\"well that's not my problem\". Nice. Definitely brings the level of class down a notch or two. But don't fret, just use the loo no later than 4.30pm or, alternatively, you can always walk down the road to Floor 2 of Selfridges!"

In a fine period house in Manchester Square along Duke Street, the Wallace Collection is a truly remarkable tribute to the taste of the family that put it together. There are paintings by iconic artists ('The Laughing Cavalier' by Frans Hals, various Rembrandts including a self-protrait and a study of his son, van Dyke, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Velasquez, Titian, and so on and so on: there is a fine collection of armour and weapons: there are miniatures, snuff boxes, glassware and porcelain of breathtaking quality. And all this is in rooms full of furniture of the very highest quality. The jaw drops from the moment you go into the spectacular entrance hall. And the glorious thing is ... it's all absolutely free (although donations are encouraged: buying the excellent guide book is a useful solution at this point, as both parties benefit). If there are 12 of you a pre-booked group tour would be well worth it- the guide we listened to in one room yesterday was first-rate- but there is also an audio guide for individuals. The 'but' ? Well , the restaurant in the covered courtyard really does have some problems with its service to sort out: my wife's (somewhat dry) lemon cake arrived a long, long time after the coffee (we were on the point of leaving) and the two people next to us had been there ages before their main courses arrived. The restaurant is a disappointment but definitely the only one. You really should go !!!"

A lot that was in the Tower has been dispersed, some of it to Leeds. This leaves the Wallace Collection as possibly the best collection easily accessible.

It was collected by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Marquesses, and his illegitimate son who became Sir Richard Wallace. It was bequeathed to the nation in 1897. Much of the collection is 18th century Paris. There was a free guided tour that was given by a most informed docent, who loved her job. The furniture and paintings were exquisite. My favorite painting was of The Laughing Cavalier. It is free to tour and certainly worth a look."

I'd heard about it 40 years ago, but the glamour of the National Gallery, Portrait Gallery, Tate Galleries and so on had always tempted us to revisit those well-known places. Finally, we found ourselves in London on a very wet day and decided to find our way to Manchester Square, actually not too far from Oxford Street. We were astounded! The collection is housed in a wonderful old building and every room is a treasure-trove. There are wonderful paintings, porcelain, furniture - and I believe armour as well but I have yet to see those rooms. I couldn't believe that there was no entrance fee and yet the house was not too crowded. It truly was a quiet haven close to the heart of the busy Oxford Street area. We had afternoon tea in the stunning glass-covered Orangerie and although it was not cheap, it was truly a part of the Wallace Collection experience! We will certainly return to Manchester Square on our next visit to London, and meanwhile, I am spreading the word!"

After visiting most of the top museums London has to offer, including the National Gallery, I have to say that the Wallace Collection is my favorite art museum in the city. While the two museums I mentioned are both free, the Wallace Collection had a more intimate feel and it was less crowded, so you didn't feel like people were pushing you to move on to the next piece. You could have as much time as you wanted admiring each work of art, and photography was also freely permitted, unlike in the National Gallery.At the same time, since this is a collection, the exhibits aren't just limited to paintings or art. Each room is beautiful in its own, with different colored silk wallpaper, exquisite furniture, chandeliers, candle holders, statuettes, vases and various other decorations that are very enjoyable to see.We were suggested to go upstairs first and work our way down, which was great because just walking up the grand staircase was impressive on its own and most visitors feel like taking pictures before even entering the first room, due to how wonderful the place itself looks.The ground floor holds armory and pottery and various other items that we had not seen in any of the other museums we visited.If you only have a short stay in London and can't visit all the art museums you'd like, I recommend you choose the Wallace Collection because it won't feel overwhelming and it brings together all the beautiful art you might be looking for."

It was also not too crowded (and I visited in August) and was very manageable as it is in the home that the collectors owned. There are maybe around 20 rooms to see altogether. You could spend lots of time in there or could just pop in and out, as it does have free entry. The guides in each room were extremely helpful and took loads of time to explain paintings and other works in detail.We did not eat at the restaurant, as we didn't have time.

Unlike the Museum it doesn't get too busy, definitely go and see it if you live in London or are visiting. There is a nice display of armour and weapons there which can help keep sulky teenage boys happy, this is cool as kids can make a trip to an exhibition a day of misery. But don't eat there, the restaurant is over priced with a limited menu featuring average food and the service is rubbish; a definite no star.

We almost missed going to the Wallace Collection, because of an awful street map & faulty directions given by a couple of friendly locals who weren't sure where it was, but I was so glad that we didn't give up looking, & once we found it (tucked away beside a park in Manchester Square, just of Marylebone st) it was so very well worth it! The house in itself is a piece of art- if classic architecture & old english mansions even slightly interest you, then this is the place to visit! Twenty-eight rooms filled with a wide range of art work- something that will interest everyone- french porcelain, antique furniture and many paintings, ranging from Rubens to Murillo to many other european artists; The richly coloured wallpaper only enhance and add to the whole feel of the place, there is also a huge armoury collection-located just behind the cloak room and small gift shop, with knights, horses, swords from all over europe; it was the first time that my wingey 15 yr old who hardly enjoyed anything on all our 20day trip around the UK, grabbed the camera and started snapping away (you're allowed photos with no flash in the Wallace House) The staff are helpful and proud of what they do, one lady even offered to take a photo of the 3 of us in the armoury; there is also a cloak room to leave your bags, where you can leave a small donation here or at the entrance. There was also a lovely restaurant located in the middle of the courtyard, which we would have loved to try, but were in a rush for time. Our time here was very relaxing, and well worth 2-3 hours we spent; a privated art collection, with free entrance, I hardly ever give ratings with \"excellent\" but the Wallace House well deserves it!"

Inside this magnificent house, you will see some very famous and some not so famous paintings, armour from around the world, as well as French porcelain and furniture. The collection was acquired by several generations of the family and it reflects the personal tastes of the collectors, which tended to 18th century France, although other schools and centuries are also represented. At the time I visited, there was a temporary exhibit of early 19th century watercolours that was of great interest. Knowledgeable staff members are easy to find and happy to answer questions; there is information about each room and its contents in binders in that room. There is also a small guidebook for sale at the entrance. The house itself is part of the experience--it invites visitors to step backwards in time to a vanished way of life. The restaurant and cafe offer pleasant surroundings and good food when one has become overwhelmed by the collection. I visited in July 2013, at a time when the British Museum and all the other well-known attractions were bustling, yet the Wallace Collection was uncrowded and exceptionally pleasant."

I believe there were audio guides, but we didn't use them. AMAZING painting, armor and china collections. The rooms are lovely - all in different silk coverings & color schemes. Very well planned out, with history placards describing each room. There were Reubens, Fragonard, Rembrandt, Van Dyck's, Broughills, Titians, Raphaels, Vermeers and more. Lovely, intricate furniture - Wedgewood inserts on desks, beautiful clocks (that all kept perfect time). Easy to walk around in and enjoy. Very thoughtfully curated and displayed. There was a large armor room with suits of armor, swords, chainmail and more - from European as well as Indian & Asia cultures. There was an amazing looking additional armor room closed for refurb that had some really large, impressive looking horse armor too. SO many muskets, sheilds, swords and more. Gorgeous detail, gems and carvings.Lovely display rooms with china, curios, protected iconography and biblical papers lovingly preserved. One room just full of snuff boxes & cameos. Everything from painstakingly carved wooden religious items, to gold=plated iconography, illustrated pages from Bibles & Hymnals from the 1300-1400s, onyx statues and more. Quite a bit of statuary in marble as well as onyx. there is a cafe/ restaurant in the middle in a greenhouse type area - lots of people there & then menu looked lovely for tea. There was another exhibit about Paris in the downstairs (go to middle courtyard & down the stairs) that we didn't have time to catch as it was almost closing time ( 5pm) .There is a little giftshop as well as facilities - nice area & hidden gem that I would have had NO idea was here! (Thanks TA!) You could easily spend 3-4 hours there. After your visit - go back 1 block east of Selfridge's to Jame's St. for a great lane/ street of outdoor cafes."

The Wallace is exactly that kind of place and it is located in the beautiful setting of the house inhabited by the collectors. There is a lot of to see, but you won't like everything because it is so diverse, so you can walk faster in certain rooms and focus on what really touches you. The temporary exhibition on watercolours of Paris in the 1800's by English painters is worth visiting too. Even using the ladies room is a pleasant experience."

Minutes from Bond Street station, and free, it's tucked quietly into a regent Marylebone square and is one of my favourite places to go in London, full-stop. Construction began on what was originally called Manchester House in 1766. The building was bought into the Hertford family in 1797 and in 1871 when one of the family, Richard Wallace, moved there from Paris he brought much of the family's art collection with him. Following his death, the building became a museum in 1900. Not unlike the Frick Collection in New York, this is an enthralling attraction on three fronts. Firstly, it is a world-class collection of art, including paintings by Titian, Hals, Rembrandt, Rubens, Canaletto, Gainsborough, Reynolds and van Dyk. All in one place, these are some of the most eye-catching assets you might find in any single art collection in London, not to mention the furniture and works of sculpture which abound throughout the building. Secondly, it is a beautiful piece of architecture and interior design in its own right. It is the product of several developments, begun by architect Joshua Brown, with subsequent additions and changes throughout the 19th century, and developments including a roof over the courtyard added only a few years ago. The interior design is also intricate, with every room in perfect proportion and displaying gorgeous use of colour. Thirdly, in especial similarity to the Frick, it is a fascinating snapshot of a home once occupied by a wealthy family. It offers visitors a window into the social history of the city. The art that is housed in all this splendour is an insight into knowing tastefulness, conspicuous consumption, and the pursuit of wealth that lasts beyond the human lifespan, all of which characterise the life of Victorian aristocracy. If you fancy some fine art, a resplendent setting and a bit of social history while you're at it, and you want to be able to access it for free, you really can't do better than this jewel."

I visited with my sister and our 'quick visit' turned into three hours and we still didn't quite get through it before they closed. There's a cafe on a terrace that would be an amazing lunch spot, perhaps next time. The largest gallery room was closed while we were there but you won't miss it as paintings have been moved into other rooms. Each room has a theme and there are guide sheets available to talk you through the highlights. The decor of the rooms themselves is worth noticing.

It looked like a grand walled mansion on the outside and I thought perhaps the focus of the collection would be fancy paintings and furniture. I was very wrong and would have missed a wonderful collection if I went with my first impression. I had by this point been the major museums in town: The V&A, The Tates, The British Museum which are all multi-day excursions that overwhelm you. I loved the Wallace because not only was it manageable within a morning or afternoon visit but because it had a very good collection. It had the architecture, the jewellery, the relics, the furniture, the paintings, and my personal favorite, weapons and armor. They even had a section where children (and adults) can try helmets and mail shirts. The cafe had very good food with reasonable medium/high pricing. If you are looking for a more intimate half day museum visit that doesn't skimp on anything visit the Wallace Collection."

There is a delicious collection of art from various European centres and with names of artists that trip off the tongue of even those least educated in art. Free to the public, but do make a donation, the works from the 16th century (earlier indeed) to the 19th century are appealing with only a limited number of less interesting pieces and far more of those that really buy the eye. We were there only briefly, mainly to show a friend the Laughing Cavalier. For that alone it is worth a visit. As per the title, don't leave it for a rainy day. There is a very good cafe/restaurant on the premises but I chose not to use it today as time was limited. If you do intend to eat then I would recommend earlier rather than later as, with a lot of venues, staffing levels for those taking lunch there may be a tad stretched - but perhaps that has changed since my visit previous to this one."

Admission is free-of-charge but visitors are encouraged to make a \u00a35 donation. All of the collections displayed are of staggering high quality - Old Master paintings (English, French, Italian and Dutch schools); French porcelain (as recently featured on BBC 4's programme 'A Passion for Porcelain'); armour and weaponry; early Italian maiolica; miniatures; be-jewelled gold boxes and other exotic knick-Knackery; furniture; clocks etc. etc. You will need at least 3 hours to do this museum collection justice - longer if you eat in the classy restaurant on- site. What a privilege to have such an amazing repository of the Arts displayed just a stone's throw from London's Oxford Street. The house is beautiful - lavish decoration and interior fittings. The shop stocks an amazing range of arts-related books as well as other souvenir items."

A 5 min walk along George street , turn right on Manchester Street and you see the board directing you to the front entrance . I was given a free floorplan to get started. At first glance, it doesn't look very big, but once you're inside, there are quite a few rooms to cover. I spent a little less than 2 hrs , and it was really worth it.The house itself is amazing , and the balustrade along the stairs leading to the first floor is quite stunning . The decor in each room is beautiful and complements the paintings , chandeliers, furniture and intricate clocks ( in some of them ) . There were hand books with explanations for the paintings , which are quite different to the usual stuff you'd find in some of the bigger museums. What I really enjoyed, is that you can get really close to the paintings to have a look, without any rope barrier between you and the painting. The armoury section was interesting . Photography was permitted everywhere as long as no flash was used. The only thing I found a little annoying, was the lighting for the bigger paintings. If you stood close to the paintings , there was so much glare that you couldn't view it well. So in most cases I'd have to go to the other end of the room, which no doubt gave you a better view , but with my short sightedness was a slight drawback. However, this is such a small issue that I wouldn't worry about it. I didnt get to try the restaurant, but it looked beautifully laid out and inviting...maybe next time . All in all a must see if time permits. On exiting the museum, diagonally across the road on your right is a short cut to Baker Street ( I think it was Fitzharding Street) from where you can catch a bus. I didn't realise I could just cut across and did the long route , returning the way I came from George street. Walked back to Orchard Street and popped into M & S before hopping on the bus again.Note: I was there exactly at opening time 10am . Apart from me, there were only another 3 or 4 people and it made moving around easy. I'm not sure how crowded it gets later on , but would recommend getting there early."

The 9 year old boy loved the Armour and guns and the older members were fascinated by the art collection, but being philistines rather than art historians, were curious about the lack of clothing on at least 75% of the models depicted! After questioning the many helpful guides we came to the conclusion that the majority of the paintings were 17th century pornography painted for the delight of the upper classes. All very interesting but the very young girls in suggestive poses are not really acceptable in today's climate so must be viewed as part of a history that, although cannot be erased, has to be looked on as unacceptable today. The restaurant in this magnificent building is worthy of a 5* rating. The youngest member of our family party (who ate an octopus starter and a whole Dover sole) is nut intolerant and the care and help given to him by the excellent staff was second to none. The quality of the ingredients and the way they were cooked were amazing and we recommend anyone wanting a meal in top class surroundings books here straightaway.

There is a non-fussy feeling about the House, and you are left to wander on your own, or you can join an informative guide for a tour. The decoration of the house itself is so beautiful, and you can just marvel at that alone, without even taking notice of the exhibits - the chandeliers especially are absolutely amazing. The exhibits themselves include portraits (The Laughing Cavalier) and interesting, funny paintings of everyday scenes. The collection of suits of armour is second-to-none, I especially loved the horse armour. This place really allows you to imagine yourself back in time, and I wish I lived nearer so that I could visit it more regularly, there is so much to see. AND IT'S FREE."

The artwork was amazing and to see everything in the lovely rooms of this amazing mansion just added to the experience. The armory collection was huge and would be fun together with children who like fairytales of knights and such. I would recommend visitors to start the tour by making a reservation at the cafe/restaurant if you would like to eat there as it gets very busy. We didn't want to wait so we left and had our lunch at the corner of Wigmore and James St. at Ayoush, a moroccan restaurant. Fabulous tagine!"

Just behind Oxford Street (near to Selfridges) is the one-time mansion of a family of great collectors - and it has been wonderfully kept together. There is some exquisite fine art (including the Fragonard swing), much French \"court of Versailles\" furniture, armoury including unusual Sikh helmetry, ceramics, enamels etc etc. And all free for entry - though I certainly would recommend you make the suggested donation or buy a guide book - it certainly is worthy of support. And in the atrium in the middle of the house is a light and airy restaurant with a tempting menu. We spent a good 3 hours here, and still did not feel we did it all justice. But what a delight to take a break from shopping, get away from the hurly burly in the contemplation of some wonderful art, then refresh yourself with afternoon tea - or meet up after a long days shop for a relaxed and tranquil dinner?"

If you spend a week in London, you can visit several deservedly famous museums or historical buildings every day and never make it down the list to places like the Wallace Collection.But it's smaller museums like the Wallace Collection or Sir John Soane's House that, I think, really give you a feel for England. Both of these museums are former private residences that have been converted into museums in order to display the original owner's collections of art and antiquities.The Wallace Collection is a mansion near the Bond Street tube station. Admission is free, and the collection is amazing. The sheer quantity of artwork by famous painters that line the walls is overwhelming. And the furniture and clocks and other items in each room are equally deserving of your attention. The massive collection of armor is comprehensive and very well preserved.I've visited London a dozen times, and I'd never even heard of this museum. It was recommended to me by a tour guide at the Museum of the Order of St. John (also worth a visit). I'm glad I finally got to see it."

The feeling of being in the townhouse of a 18th/19th C patron of the arts is what sets this gallery apart.The paintings themselves are mostly fine, and in some cases less fine examples of the \"old masters\" - you will not find anything here from after about 1820. The galleries are all actual rooms in the house and titled accordingly - Landing, Salon, Drawing Room East etc. This is the only place in London to see really decent Canalettos, Bouchers and the like. From the catalogue the armoury (which I did not see) looks splendid and would undoubtedly appeal to small boys of all ages who did not fancy viewing the paintings.On a distinctly non-artistic but necessary point, the loos are some of the finest I have encountered in a public building in the UK."

Magnificent examples of Sevres and Limoges craftsmanship nestle alongside porcelain miniatures and illuminated manuscripts, overlooked by a variety of old masters including French 18th century, Dutch landscapes, Titian and of course The Laughing Cavalier. However, for me the most outstanding items on show were the exceptionally elegant majolica pieces of which there were many. The furniture in the 1st floor rooms was finer than that which can be found in most European stately homes and the armory will be of interest to enthusiasts of antique guns, swords and armour. Just five minutes walk from Marble Arch tube station and it is free."

Set in a private mansion house in Central London this is not one of the better known museums but should definately be on your list to visit.The art particularly paintings is quite extensive and beautifully displayed,it is also the home to the famous painting the Laughing Cavalier and many others and there is no fee for entrance.The collections are spread over many rooms but for me the highlight was the arms and armour collection.Wonderful swords helmets and shields from British India and the days when England had an Empire very nostalgic.Definately worth a visit....................."

Situated just a short walk north from Oxford Street, the collection is housed in beautiful Hertford House, originally the home of the Marquesses of Hertford. The French 18th century paintings, furniture & antiquities are displayed in original room settings & include masterpieces by Rubens, Watteau, Fragonard & Canaletto. There is no entry charge but donations are invited. Guided tours take place daily. It\u2019s not really suitable for young children but some older teens may find it interesting. I\u2019d suggest you allow about 2 hours to see the whole collection, longer if you\u2019re an enthusiast."

The Wallace Collection is one of those museums which slips off most people's radars when they think of central London museums which is a shame as it is a great little oasis just off the madness that is Oxford St.I have only had a chance to visit the armoury section (with a little boy who is mad about Knights) but it has an impressive range of medieval armour from Europe and Asia.There is also a decent cafe (Peyton & Byrne) in a glassed over courtyard which is great for a cake & coffee break."

There's no doubt about it: the Wallace Collection is a genuine hidden gem, a truly amazing collection of paintings, ceramics and armour in a private house in a smart but otherwise unremarkable square close to Oxford Street.However, as many other reviewers have pointed out, it's badly let down by the hopelessly mismanaged caf\u00e9. On paper it looks wonderful. The setting is a beautiful space filled with natural light. But the service is woefully slow and simply can't cope with even the small surge of customers who arrive for coffee and breakfast after the museum opens in the morning. The web site makes it sound marvellous. Sadly it's a fine example of how modern British management is better at flattering itself than serving customers."

They have a huge collection of arms and armor from many places/periods (in fact, one of the largest and best in England), they have an excellent collection of decorative arts, paintings (including several Dutch Masters, Watteau, Rembrandt , and Rubens), French and Italian landscapes, porcelain, and Wedgewood. In a word, WOW!From the moment you enter Hertford House, just off Baker Street, about a mile south of Baker Street Station, your eye travels from one fantastic item to the next. The arms rooms, and there are several covering Asian, Indian, European arms and armor, you can't help but be impressed by the exquisite workmanship. They collected the best and most beautifully executed works of the ages. This is a must see for anyone into arms and armor, or into decorative arts, or fine paintings. Hals' \"The Laughing Cavalier\" is here, and it's always a treat to see such works up close where you can appreciate the finest details. I encountered someone who was looking for the hidden signature on a landscape. It was like a glorious treasure hunt! I was disappointed that they were out of stock in the gift shop of a book I was most anxious to get my hands on, but it turned out to my benefit. I checked one of the prominent book sites, and found them there, available in the US. So, do your research in advance, and if there are any books you're interested in from museum exhibits, check your book sites first, rather than risk having to lug them around in your luggage. "

It's very impressive, go to the website to see more about the collections and to get directions and maps. Staffed by an impressive range of peeps all very informed and happy to talk about the exhibits. There are a number of guided tours , these seem to happen all through day but again check the website or ring to find out more. .There is a lift , the stairs are a nightmare (my knees are crap) and there is a swanky restaurant set in a lovely light and airy atrium on the lower ground floor. noisy , so turn your hearing aids down .

Much less crowded than the National Gallery so you can enjoy your visit at a more relaxed pace. Although it's a bit smaller than I expected, the collection is very rich and the decoration of the house is extravagant. You can rent an audio guide for \u00a33 from the museum shop which is really worth the price. It's detailed but takes a long time to listen to every interpretation carefully, so plan your time wisely, maybe hit a few famous ones first before searching for your own favourites. It's home to some very interesting paintings and art crafts, worth a visit for people who come to London on a regular basis but not so much for first timers I guess."

You are minutes away from this and more at the Wallace Collection in Manschester Square, just behind Selfridges. The collection is made up of exqusite objet d'art, furniture, curiosities, paintings ect including several well known masterpieces incluiding the Laughing Cavilier and The Swing, all set in the spendor of an intact Georgian Town Palace. And, best of all, it is free to the public. In the enclosed and roofed courtyard is an excellent cafe featuering beautiful cakes and pastries, cream teas as well as more subsantial fare for the hard core shopper needing refueling. The collection is expertly displayed and there are guides and experts throughout the house who are happy to explain items or help you to find the most minute and incredible detial in some of the carvings in the medievial collections. THe overall decor can only be described as sumptuous. It truly is an amazing place that few Londoners let alone out of town or overseas visitors know about. Therefore you can stroll casually and through uncrowded rooms, taking your time and enjoying the splendors of a byegone age before popping back into the 21st century hustle and bustle that is London."

Here, beyond the Murillos gathered in their own gallery on the lower ground floor, there are the East Galleries, which amid so much else contain lovely works by ter Borch, de Hooch, Steen, and Metsu. As you meander into a connecting room you suddenly notice, in addition to the Ruisdael, two Rembrandts--a wonderful self-portrait and a fine picture of his son.

The collection consists mainly of art from France which was shrewdly purchased by this family during the French Revolution, when they could buy if for very cheap! The woman tour guide we had was a French woman who had an extensive knowledge of all the pieces and collections and explained all areas in detail. The beauty of the items is unbelieveable.

The latter sounds dull but it contains amazing historical stuff that this visitor had never seen or heard of before. There are occasional free tours of the collection and lectures too. There is also a shop."

I had been to all the 'big' museums in London many times and wanted to try something new. It is in a beautiful building with a lovely ambiance and a great collection. It is bite sized so you get a real full and lovely experience without it feeling overwhelming. My friend who lives in London proclaims it to be here hands down favorite museum and she will just wander in on some days to disappear for a few moments into it's loveliness. It also has a very cute little boutique shop and I use my pen and glasses cleaner embued with my favorite painting in the collection every night. Reiminds me of my happy day at the Wallace."

The Wallace collection is in London... thanks to a(nother) Revolution in France (when Sir Wallace decided to play it safe and to come back to England). This gentleman was a collector of any kind of art and it is all well represented in the display. For instance, it offers UK's second largest collection of armours (after the Tower of London). I have been there 4 or 5 times, and each time is was not crowded at all. Just go there, and you will be surprised."

Murillo\u2019s expressive technique - warm and specific colours in his late stage shows how he was using sfumato techniques. Murillo was very famous for his paintings of religious and everyday life pictures and it is perfect chance to see this perfection from so gifted master.This fabulos colection and whole place - hard to find anywhere- need to be seen.You need time to see and enjoy , explore and have a grate time.It was not my first time but not last as well to visited this grate place.This is the best kept secret."

I say cafe, but it is effectively a restaurant with a limited menu. There were 5 of us and we had variously - soup, mussels & chips, quiche, and tea/coffee/elderflower cordial /gin & Tonic ! It wasn't cheap (what in London is ?) but it was very good, in a lovely setting, much nicer than a typical coffee shop or starbucks.

The ground floor and first floor rooms with the paintings and miniatures and bible calligraphy pages is what I visited most recently. The objects in the cases are protected by leather coverings, that you pick up one by one to examine. So it is kind of like opening a present each time. Fun and beautiful.

After that, I wandered the house, viewing fine paintings (including a famous Rembrandt), stunning furniture, and examining Marie Antoinette's toiletries. The French porcelain on display (much of it Louis the XVI and Marie Antoinette's) is some of the finest examples I've ever seen. There's an extensive armoury collection, too, but that's not my thing, so I skipped a lot of it. I recommend it more for adults than kids."

The carte was, I thought, much better value for money; the dishes on the set menu looked rather simple and the portions quite small, though my friend said he enjoyed it very much. My starter of poached egg and wild mushrooms was a wonderful, deeply flavoursome experience; a perfect beginning. But the roasted brill I had for main course was even better - a thick and sizeable piece of fillet, perfectly cooked, with the lightest of sauces, accompanied by tender pieces of violet artichoke. This dish cost rather less than twenty pounds - much less than you would pay in many restaurants. The two others at the table had roasted rump of veal, also with a delicious sauce and accompaniments. The house wine was of good quality, given the reasonable price and the espresso we finished with as good as any I've had in France or Italy and better than some."

I won't say don't bother, it definitely is an interesting place, but whether you love it or not is very much a matter of personal taste. For lovers of the baroque, the ornate, the 18thC and, frankly, camp historical bling, it's a very heaven. But modern minimalists may want to take a rain check!"

It houses a superb collection of historic porcelain, metalwork, clocks, armour, paintings and furniture. For so many of the exhibits most of the national museums of the world would dearly love to own - such is their artistic and historic merit.As well as its permanent collection there is a brilliant conservation display, a great restaurant, library and lecture theatre.Easy to get to being a short walk north of Oxford Street."

The Wallace Collection is to be found in Hertford House, Manchester Square, a few minutes walk north of Bond Street tube station. More relevantly for me, it's a gentle stroll from Marylebone Station, where I arrive when I come in from the country.Visiting this extraordinary collection is a perfect start to a day in London. I'm not interested in the extraordinary collection of armour and weaponry, and probably don't spend enough time admiring the beautiful furniture and porcelain, mostly French and from the 18th century.What I, and most visitors, go for are the paintings, many of which are unsurpassed in any museum anywhere. You could spend a day just in the main hall which, among many masterpieces, contains 'The Laughing Cavalier', by Frans Hals, The 'Dance to the Music of Time' by Poussin and, amazingly, three paintings of Mrs Mary Robinson (the actress known as 'Perdita') by Gainsborough, Reynolds and Romney. There's glory for you.But what draws me in more often than not are extraordinarily complete collections of paintings from 18th century France and the Netherlands of the century before. Here are a few of my favourites: from France, the exquisite portrait by Francois Boucher of a young Madame de Pompadour in a salmon pink dress, and the saucy 'Swing' by Fragonard; and from Holland a moving pair of works by Pieter de Hooch - that tender painter of children - one of a little girl helping her mother peel apples, the other of a little by delivering bread to a housewife; and a moving portrait of a lace maker, by Caspar Netscher.And all these gems can be seen for free! So you can just stroll in, spend five minutes in front of one of your favourites, and stroll out again."

It was through the information sheet that I learnt about the tricks which Canaletto employed to ensure that his paintings were saleable to a foreign, not local, market. If you like Reynolds, Frans Hals, Rembrandt, Fragonard, Sevres porcelain etc etc, then this is the place to come. It's also incredibly quiet. I visited on a Saturday afternoon when the whole of Oxford Street was pedestrianised before Christmas and yet there were only a handful of people in each room.

The Wallace Collection is a hidden gem \u2013 a rare place that is privately owned, yet free to enter, consisting of some precious work from artists of great repute. I wish the staff was a bit nicer though. They remind me of British Airways cabin crew: the tight smile (if there is ever a smile or acknowledgement), a barely hidden snootiness and a feeling of Little-Britain (or League of Gentlemen) type provincialism. The staff there have the face of someone barely tolerating visitors, walking about with loud, angry, accusatory steps, thumping over the laminate flooring. That kind of angry, emotionally-dead Englishness is slowly dying, but at the Wallace Collection it lives on, fustily. The British were probably like this in India in the dying days of Empire (sulky, refusing to emote, unable to feel, all hidden behind a mask of passive anger, cloaking a lack of achievement). Thankfully most of London is no longer like this \u2013 most of London is more real, alive, human, even trendy. Walk through Charlotte Street in Fitzrovia or Soho Square and you see the real London \u2013 people who work, read, eat and emote. Real human beings who feel real emotions. The staff at the Wallace Collection isn\u2019t like this. The staff at the South Bank centre are nice, so are those at the legendary Curzon cinemas."

Pay particular attention to the furniture, the collection displays an impressive number of matching pieces from the Boulle school. You can recognise them as they use the same wood cuts but in opposite effects, a highly precise technique that took months to craft back in the 18th century. There is an impressive armoury which will delight little boys and grown men, and some of the armours are placed at ground level so that one can watch their reflection in the cabinet glass and imagine they're inside it.A very nice cafe/restaurant in the center courtyard has a glass ceiling makes it perfect in winter to catch a bit of daylight.

Combine your day at the museum with shopping on Oxford Street a few blocks away (you can check your purchases while you look around). A beautiful building, with art displayed in every room. An amazing collection - paintings by all manor of famous painters, miniatures, lovely Sevres and Majolica porcelain, sculptures, furniture, illuminated manuscripts and jewellery. I even enjoyed the display of weapons and armor (beautiful engraving and jewels on the hilts of the swords and pistols).And it's free!! This museum is well worth a visit, as is the gift shop (we didn't try the restaurant)."

The size of the museum means that it gives a personal feel, and you can easily get round all the rooms. Being a collection means that there is something for everyone, the ceramics and beautiful and the paintings are really interesting , with some well known and some much less so. It is very interesting to see all the different styles. As it is free entery you feel happy to go in and just study one area , and visit again to spend more time looking at other things. As well as all the works of art I find the house very interesting , and each room can give you the feeling of being taken back in time and imagine living in such a house. Of course the resturant in the covered courtyard gives a welcome break and is a lovely place to sit and relax over tea or coffee, although the service can be a little slow. I will Keep returning to the Wallace collection"

Sadly, these arrangements had seen better days. We were underwhelmed by the finger sandwiches - think 'care in the community' - no flavour but edible. The sandwiches were accompanied by three miniature cakes that had seen better days. We sent them back requesting a swap - the elderly little cakes for one slice of carrot cake. This was refused. Although the particularly ancient strawberry tart was retired and replaced by a morsel of apple cake. We ate our expensive little fossils with no pleasure. A lot of money for mediocre food. The addition of a 12.5% 'optional' service charge was contemptuous. "

We spent several hours touring this positively wonderful museum tucked away on a charming little square near Oxford Street shopping as well as not far from The British Museum. The exhibitions of 18th and 19th century paintings, sculptures and others artworks (furniture, porcelain) were truly representative of some of the great masters collected by the Marquesses of Hertford and Sir Richard Wallace. The restaurant in the downstairs courtyard looked like a great luncheon spot. We plan to return the next time we travel to London."

The prices in the shop were a bit steep and were they slightly less so I would have made several purchases, however this did not seem to deter people.Location excellent just being a short walk from Oxford St. I think they should advertise more and get more revenue from the cafe and shop to help maintain the artworks."

We went round the paintings the sculpture, the china/pottery. All of it fascinating - something for any interest, and in some parts even if you aren't interested you still have to look. Because it's a collection and not a museum (in the sense of the British Museum say) it has a personal feel and a little quirkiness that adds to teh charm - not to mention the Canalettos, the Ruebens, the Gainsboroughs....I could go on.

Understandably, with so many fine antiquities close at hand, the staff are always nearby, but my wife found their constant directions to move away from \"this chair\" or \"that cabinet\" a little neurotic, as we didn't have any intention of touching the said items. If the museum was busy I should think the staff would be having kittens, (or restrict numbers in each room?)Fine furnishings personally hold a limited appeal to me, although the craftsmanship in these items was stunning. The medieval weaponry and armour collection has to be the finest I have seen outside the Royal Armouries in Leeds. Some truly fearsome looking weapons and the mounted Knights were stunning, giving a small insight as to how awesome these warriors must have been. A great way to spend a few hours away from the frenzy of west end shops."

Their collection of Sevre porcellain is quite lovely also. While this period of art isn't my favorite, it was wonderful to spend a couple hours in just to see it. We ate a small late lunch in the cafe, which is beautfiul situated in the glass topped courtyard of the house.

We also enjoyed lunch at the restaurant - which was of an excellent standard (although reasonably pricey). It is in a lovely setting - what must have been a garden area once, but which now has a high glass roof so it feels light and airy while being indoors.We were admiring 'the Laughing Cavalier' - one of the most famous paintings here, when a guide approached us to tell us all about the forthcoming refurbishment - and not to worry that he would still be on display elsewhere in the house for the duration. She was very friendly and informative. We enjoyed all the house - particularly the fantastic collection of Canallettos.All in all, a very pleasant outing indeed."

There is so much to look at at this collection - I had no idea they could have so much and still be such a well kept secret! I think they have more armor to look at than the Tower of London! The upstairs section has been preserved as the family might have lived in it and is full of the artwork and collectibles the family amassed over many years and that the trust has collected.I highly recommend eating at the restaurant in the atrium. The natural light is beautiful and while there is a definite \"museum mark up\" the service is very attentive and everything we ordered was perfectly cooked and delicious.

The armor rooms are fascinating and include swords, daggers, muskets, and an amazing intricately carved canon.

Trip down memory lane for me. I used to visit regularly during lunch hours working round the corner 20 years ago. It was free then and it still is (plus donation of course). The kids walked into every room - going wow! They admitted this was far better than they expected. An outstanding eclectic collection of amazing paintings, armour much more, beautifully presented. Nice cafe in central atrium with an extensive selection of teas - I tried white silver needle tea - very nice. Kids loved the armour dressing up zone in the lower ground floor. Easy to visit and totally inspiring."

The glorious arms and armour collection, the beautifully-laid-out furniture, china and statuary, the wonderful pictures - everything is magnificently displayed and beautifully curated, with just enough information and skilled staff on hand to offer more. The collection of Marie Antoinette's possessions is particularly well displayed, giving a real feel for what rooms of the era might have looked like. The house is an artwork in itself, carefully balancing the transformation into a modern museum with the preservation of its history. The staff are absolutely charming, among the most helpful and pleasant in any London museum."

If you want a great place to eat lunch in secluded elegant surroundings, minutes from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street, you should try the restaurant at the Wallace Collection. The restaurant is set in the now glass-roofed courtyard of Hertford House, former home of the Wallace family, which also houses the Wallace Collection. The collection itself is well worth a visit. It's an eclectic mix of mediaeval religious iconography, armoury and historic weapons, Meissen and other pottery and paintings which include The Laughing Cavalier and Fragonard's \"The Swing\" - an erotic painting which seems tame by today's standards, but was quite racy in it's day. And once you've filled up on culture, you can sit down and enjoy fine food in this elegant ( if noisy- all the surfaces are hard and the space is large and loud) restaurant. It's hard to believe you are just a couple of blocks north of Oxford Street when you visit this place. It transports you to another world, which is all to the good. So, if you're anywhere near Oxford Street and you fancy a different lunch experience, head to Hertford House on Manchester Square. You'll be amazed and surprised: it's one of London's best kept secrets - until now."

This museum is not huge and overwhelming like some others and yet there is much to see. There is an audio guide available as well as printed leaflets in the galleries to tell you about the works. This is definitely on my \"must do again\" list."

This is quite simply an amazing collection of arts, furniture, porcelain, minatures, armour (the list goes on and on...) that I have ever had the pleasure to visit, all in a beautiful and accessible house in Manchester Square. A fabulously displayed and obviously well-loved treasure house that is a must-see in London. Moving from room to room in this beautiful house was quite unlike anything I'd experienced and I will definitely be returning here as well as buying the book of the collection. It is bursting at the seams with countless treasures of sheer beauty. Highly recommended!"

It's located in Hertford House, in Manchester Square. It's a very short walk from Oxford Street and yet it's a million miles away in terms of culture and refinement.The Wallace Collection has over 5,500 items categorised as fine and decorative arts - and I think that includes the amazing collection of armour! It attempts and I think succeeds in trying to retain a sense of what the paintings, sculpture, furniture and china etc would have looked like when the collection was part of a family house prior to the bequest. In effect, this is a what a house would look like after its owners returned from a gigantic splurge on their \"Grand Tour\" of Europe. I always get the impression that a lot of effort and investment has gone into presenting the works at their very best.The art collection is excellent. It has a really excellent collection of Canalettos and I saw my very first paintings by Meissonier here - who was the painter of choice in Paris before those upstart Impressionists came along!"

Over many visits to London, I somehow managed to miss this superb collection, perhaps because I never expected to find a museum of this caliber just blocks from the commercial bustle of Oxford St. Still, better late than never - this is a wonderful addition to any list of London highlights.The perfect jewel box of a mansion - with its beautifully proportioned rooms, elegant pastel moldings, and sumptuous wall coverings - is worth a visit on its own. But world-class collections of art and historical artifacts make this a truly singular destination. The galleries of paintings include many remarkable works, including groups by Canaletto, Fragonard, and many, many more. Displays of miniatures - some lovely, some intricate, some simply bawdy - are handsomely presented, with explanatory texts detailing the subjects. Admirers of ceramics will find an excellent display - the Turkish pottery, Italian majolica, and lustreware kept me lingering, and lingering. The ground floor is largely dedicated to an impressive array of arms and armor, from a wide range of European weapons and mail to magnificently worked Indian and Persian ceremonial armor; life-sized models of horses display the protective devices crafted for valuable mounts.A short walk from Marble Arch, just a couple of blocks above Selfridge's flagship site, the museum is served by numerous Tube and bus lines. It's open 7 days a week, including public holidays, and - amazingly - does not charge an entrance fee."

You have seen some of these before -- the Old Masters -- and they are exquisite. It's shocking to me that they were all in one home -- such unimaginable wealth!! -- but now you can see them for free (do make a donation). If you can take your eyes off the walls, the furniture and porcelain are equally breath-taking. Most memorable for me: a portrait of a toddler by an unknown artist, said to be recently cleaned. I wonder what would happen to the Old Masters if they dared to clean them -- would some darkened, muddy colors become as vivid as this? Most memorable for my husband: the armor and weapons, which take up half the ground floor. I will have to go back to see them because he says they are absolutely incredible. Take advantage of the collecting mania of the very rich of a previous century, and see the Wallace Collection when you're in London."

The fine porcelain, sculptures, furniture, armour and weapons also reward attention.The nation should be grateful for the clever collecting of five generations of Marquesses of Hertford and to Lady Hertford who bequeathed the results to us.The now glass-enclosed central courtyard houses a pleasant restaurant that I recommend as a midway refreshment source as you spend a joyous at least three hours exploring these marvels.

There is something here for everyone: The vastest collection of armor that I've ever seen, period rooms, Old Masters, miniatures, majolica, amazing furnishings and decor. Though I didn't eat there, the restaurant in the courtyard looked lovely.I loved seeing Fragonard's \"The Swing.\" As well, there's Rembrandt, Pisarro, Watteau, and Rubens, among others. The size of the collection is extensive but manageable, so that it can be reasonably \"done\" in a day. There are also extensive descriptions of the rooms and all their contents available."

The Wallace Collection is my favourite galley housing a very eclectic collection of fine art so when I needed a venue for an afternoon tea this seemed a nice/special/different choice.Having read previous reviews I was forewarned that the service was poor but as we were a group of gossipy friends having a leisurely afternoon together this didn't seem important. Sure enough we were shown to our table and half an hour later we managed to attract a waiter over to take our order. After another long-ish wait our glasses of pink Champaign arrived followed by the tea served in cute cast iron teapots. Another 10 minutes or so later and the three tiered afternoon tea plates arrived.Bottom plate was a selection of finger sandwiches - a few smoked salmon, a few egg and ham and mustard which were OK but nothing spectacular. Top plate was the scones (slightly over done) with decent dollop of clotted cream and \"red\" flavour clear jam/jelly (perhaps made by Chivers?).Middle plate was a selection of mini cakes including a smashing lemon tart that was to die for. What looked like a mini 1970's retro Blackforest gateau didn't seem particularly fresh but tasted OK as did the mini Victoria sponge.All in all at \u00a317 for the main afternoon tea menu (or \u00a325 if you wish to include a glass of Champaign) the food was OK but was more than made up for by the surroundings. Ours was a sunny day and the courtyard venue and the tour before hand made it extra special and we didn\u2019t mind the long wait too much. The 12% service charge added was treated with derisionAfternoon Tea is served between 2:30 and 4:30 pm. The gallery closes at 5pm which doesn\u2019t give you time to look around afternoon so come early. As this is a Government owned museum I'd suggest any disgruntled customers feedback poor performance to DCMS and ask how they justify tolerating the poor contract management of the restaurant. Clearly the contractor is taking the museum and tax payer for a ride and badly letting down the attraction."

The courtyard area is beautiful setting and is great for a coffee or even a business meeting as several were taking place whilst we were there. The cafe itself is run by Peyton and Bryne who have several catering outlets around London.We decided to have brunch and after attracting one of several waitors attentions we were seated and each finally ordered our brunch. When it came it was beautiful the eggs royale were excellently cooked runny on the inside and firm on the our and the boiled eggs and sourdough were lovingly and quickly consumed. With coffees it was around \u00a315 a head which is not the cheapest nor the most expensive in this area and definitely worthwhile if only to sit in the atrium courtyard on a sunny day. Just a word of warning the waiting was a bit haphazard with us several times getting up to attract the staffs attention. Back in the museum the collection was vast and very different there were a large collection of various items including weapon displays that could challenge the army, minatures paintings and gentile living examples of serval eras. All made it a devine way to spend a chance day off. There are also talks and tours to watch out for and the clock tour was particularly interesting.There is a clockroom for jackets etc, and whilst there is no charge a small donation is appreciated for the muesum."

We spent 3 hours there, and covered perhaps half of the collection.Entrance is \"free\", although a donation of at least five pounds per person is appreciated (if not expected).I don't believe this would be a suitable attraction for young children, although older teenagers with an interest in history and/or art, or just an apprecation of beauty and craftmanship, may very well enjoy this remarkable place."

We pop in there occasionally with friends visiting the uk.last visit was with friends from India, and it was a perfect taster on a very busy trip.I enjoy the occasional exhibiton, and the little shop is just right. the Cafe is ideal for a treat, and a very nice environment for a chat.Do not overlook this little gem on a visit to London. Easy to reach on foot if you are on Oxford St. No charge, but donations accepted."

It's a manageable size, the collection is not too big, on 2 floors of a mansion in central London, it's free, and it closes at 5, so give it at least an hour or 2 before. It's not really for kids (wait, the back 3 rooms are full of armor and ancient weapons), but it's stuffed with large and small furniture, porcelain, and paintings, some of which are famous and stunning.There's a beautiful glassed - in atrium cafe/restaurant in the middle, but I can't vouch for the food. We didn't stop to eat."

Then there are the clocks - the girl who walked us around was really knowledgable and gave a splended presentation in her broken French English - I think she spoke far better English than she would admit and played on her accent and supposed lack of vocabulary!

There are porcelains, Louis XV ironwork and furniture, bronzes, works of art of major artists (Rembrandt, Titian, van Dyck, etc.), clocks all housed in rooms with period wallpaper, out of this world chandeliers, and luxurious window treatments.

Staff were very welcoming, took our soaking wet coats and umbrellas (summer in London). We had a good time wandering around the collection, in particular the' Time Regained: Works by Artist Goldsmith Kevin Coates' exhibition which were superb, especially the George and Dragon he made for No 10 Downing St. We had a cup of tea in the Wallace Restaurant in the courtyard which is covered with a glass roof, which had a lovely atmosphere and can be booked for dinner on Friday/Saturday evenings which we thought would be a good thing to do. All in all a great visit. The paintings were in fantastic condition with strong, bright colours considering some of them were over 500 years old. Huge collection of weapons and armour, sevres and paintings and furniture. Some of the biggest chandeliers we've seen. It must have been a fabulous place to live, when it was a private residence. Lots of lectures and family activities scheduled throughout the summer holidays. We put \u00a310 in donation box as we thought we should support it!"

They have a great collection of stuff although they could certainly do with including more than one piece per room in their audio guide.Then tried to get lunch in their restaurant. Joined a queue and we all stood there for ten minutes trying to catch a waiter's attention, but they were all deliberately ignoring us, even though there were plenty of tables free. Eventually I rang the restaurant up from my mobile (I was standing near their phone) and asked them when we might get served. When the waiter realised it was me on the phone he just hung up on me. After five more minutes the manager came among the queue to tell us they were expecting a large party. Why they couldn't have had a sign to that effect I don't know - instead they were happy to waste all our time waiting for tables that weren't going to be available. When I complained to the manager she did offer us a free drink... in fifteen minutes' time. We decided we'd had enough of standing around and went elsewhere for lunch. There are lots of good places on Marylebone High Street / Thayer St just nearby, so I'd suggest you go there. You can get back into the museum afterwards as it's free."

There were empty tables but waiting staff did not seem in any hurry to clear them and no-one seemed to be in charge of the front of house. I wrote to the managing director (Mr Peyton) as the wesite says that he would like to hear feedback but he never bothered to reply.

            "review": "Excellent Gallery. Restaurant needs serious attention. The Wallace Collection is exceptionally interesting, with a remarkable history and fine contents, mainly eighteenth century pictures and furniture. It lives in a magnificent house just off Baker Street. Admission is free; a remarkable thing in these philistine days, but one is rightly invited to give something. However, this is a review of the restaurant. Six of us went for lunch. We were in no hurry, which was all to the good as the meal took five minutes short of three hours, in a restaurant that was well populated but not full. The beautiful setting deserves exceptionally good food and service. Unfortunately, places, like people, don't always get what they deserve.We all had the set lunch, so that the kitchen should not have been unduly stretched. First courses were bland and uninteresting. Tian of crab is a good test of a kitchen, because one can produce either a fresh, tasty, thoughtful event, or just wing it, knowing that crab meat will carry one through somehow. Ours belonged, in every respect, to the second class. The main courses were much better. We had high quality salmon and tender, excellently cooked pork, with an intense jus. Desserts were disappointing. Tarte tartin is one of my favourite things: this one was ungenerous in size and not what a tt fan would expect. In England, by and large, restaurants serve imitations of good food and haut cuisine. Wallace is no exception. I did not detect a human being who really cared about what went out from his/her kitchen? But are people in this country concerned with what they eat? (A young French friend is shifting his small catering business from quality to volume because 'that's what the English want'.) The wine list looked interesting but we thought both a sancerre and a loire red did not justify their prices, even allowing for the usual restaurant mark-up. If there was a sommelier to consult, we did not see him.The service was poor, with long delays between events and - always the acid test - no attention. This is a management problem, of course.The staff were willing, but appeared to be half-trained and without direction. People were helpful when actively summoned, but rarely proactive, because one suspects they did not understand how 'front of house' should work. I did not see a head waiter at all, let alone someone who was alert to difficulties, related to his diners, and trained his staff. Should you eat here? Yes, if it is convenient, but don't expect more than a refuelling stop.If the Wallace Collection owns this restaurant then it should appoint an experienced maitre d' now; give the chef far more freedom; hire young staff willing to be trained and try for real food. If the place is out-sourced, find a company that actually cares about food and service or take it in house and start again. Galleries can run fine restaurants if they want to. (Try the Rex Whistler at Tate Britain.) The Wallace Cafe could be every bit as good. What a pity it isn't!"

It's remarkable that it's free as well, and the collection is like no other in London or probably England. The cafe is a different matter unfortunately. With its setting It ought to be a wonderful experience, and it is also an unsusual treat to have table service in a London gallery. For these reasons I wouldn't t mind paying the higher than average prices. But there was a long queue to be seated even though many tables were free, the woman at the desk asked \"Can I help you\" as though it were not obvious why one had been standing there for 10 - 15 minutes; the cake arrived separately and several mintes before the pot of tea, and it was necessary to go to the till to pay the bill because of inattentive waiting staff. The whole experience reminded me of the indifferent or snooty kind of service you often get in southern Italy or occasionally Paris."

Not only is there a wonderful collection of art, furniture and porcelain but also an amazing armor collection. They offer free guided tours. The tour I went on was led by Victoria, who not only gave information about some of the different pieces of the collection, but added in history and some very informative explanations (such as how porcelain is made). The history of some of the pieces in the collection is so rich, it made the art pieces almost come alive. Before this tour, I was only marginally interested in medieval armor, but Victoria gave such a good description of the pieces in the collection - how it was made and how armor changed over the ages - I was really fascinated. Bravo, Victoria!! After the tour, I had a wonderful lunch at the French restaurant at the Wallace Collection. The pate plate accompanied by a lovely French wine that was recommended by my waiter were the perfect ending to my visit."

I looked round and saw I was the only person in the room. Obviously, they thought I was going to nick something. Pathetic really. All they have to do is to tell people to hand in their bags when they enter.There was a horrible atmosphere throughout the museum. Groups of staff huddled together whispering. It didn't seem like a happy ship.My complaint was answered after a couple of months saying it had been forwarded to the Director of Finance (I think) who was in charge of the staff, who would be in touch.

We started with a short tour of the front of the house and had brunch in the restaurant. The staff was incredibly patient and careful around our son and helped accomodate us. I even asked for my eggs to be recooked (scrambled was incredibly runny, too much for my taste). We weren't expecting exception service, and the food was good, but the service was slow. Onward to the collection. We had a great time looking and reading up on the collection. My good review stops there. The staff followed me everywhere I pushed the stroller. At one point my husband was carrying our son in the baby bjorn and the staff would run up and tell him 'no touching!' every time he would point at an object and talk to our son. My husband was no where NEAR close to any of the objects to touch them. My son would, of course as babies do, reach out his arms and babble, especially at the paintings and suits of armor. Again the staff would run up and tell them again 'no touching'. I got fed up with it after the 3rd time considering my baby has a short reach and my husband was standing at least 2 feet from the object. I seriously doubt my baby has magical superpowers that would turn him into Elasto-boy to make his arms stretch far enough to actually touch any of the art work or armor, but the staff at the Wallace Collection behaved and acted as if that was happening. On the second floor were all the painting and serious Baroque/Roccoco collections, but we didn't stay long as the staff followed my stroller everywhere until I parked it in the corner. I felt I was being treated like a shoplifter for just having a baby with me. I found this all heavily ironic becuase the Wallace Collection has a fantastic elevator/lift and a really nice baby changing room on the bottom floor. I did not have the opportunity to really enjoy my time at the Wallace Collection because my husband and I felt like bringing our child along should have been a crime, when instead the staff should have been more understanding."

My friend reserved a table for us last Saturday at the cafe at The Wallace Collection as she had been to the cafe before and thought that it would be the ideal place for us to enjoy a light snack and a glass of bubbly before trying on dresses for my upcoming wedding. As we wanted something light we decided on the ice-cream and sorbet to go with our Champagne.When we were seated we had to wait for over 10 minutes before anyone came to take our order - in fact, nobody came - my friend had to ask the Maitre d' if anyone was serving our table and so he came to take our order himself. When we enquired as to what the sorbet was the maitre d' looked at us in disbelief and then told us that he didn't know. When he asked one of the waiters, the waiter looked baffled as to why we would want sorbet and in response the maitre d' said \"I know\" and rolled his eyes. We felt like naughty school-children and my friend felt humiliated that the location she had chosen was turning out to be so awful. Once our order for ice-cream and Champagne had been taken and after our cutlery, napkins, water glasses etc had been snatched away and a single ice-cream spoon had been slammed down in their place, the maitre d' came and knelt down at our table and told us that 'for future reference' we were not really 'allowed' to simply order sorbet and ice-cream but that as we already had there was nothing he could do - really we should have ordered a main meal and ordering sorbet & ice-cream was insufficient for a reserved table. My friend pointed out that when she had made the reservation there had been no mention of the fact that we would need to order a main meal and that she didn't really understand what the problem was. He then reiterated for 'future reference' that what we had ordered was unacceptable and so I informed him that 'for future reference' I would never be visiting the cafe again after the way that we had been spoken to.The ice-cream and Champagne was lovely and despite the embarrassment we had a great lunch-time snack but when we wanted to pay we had to ask 3 times before our bill was brought over (which was \u00a350 by the way so that was pretty expensive ice-cream!).We left feeling like we had behaved improperly yet all we had done was order items that were on the menu. We didn't realise that we would have our food choices dictated to us. I will definitely never be going back there after such a horrible experience and if I could score zero I would."

Visited the Wallace Collection a few weeks ago when we had some time to kill before a matinee performance at the Royal Opera House and it was a very pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. It's just a short walk from Selfridges on Oxford Street and entrance is free. There is also a free guided tour: although we didn't have time to do the full tour we did listen to the start which gave useful background to the collection and the family who created it. The exhibits are very Europe-centric (France in particular) but interesting nonetheless. When we visited there was a special exhibition of bronze sculpture in the basement which was staged in a very atmospheric way but unfortunately we didn't have time to visit the upstairs rooms; hopefully we will have chance to return.We stayed to have lunch in Peyton's Cafe, which is in the enclosed courtyard. The location is spectacular - comfy seating and natural daylight without the worry of rain but the food and drink we were served didn't live up to expectations. We started with a smoothie and fresh lemonade to drink - the smoothie was fine but the lemonade was very acidic. I have ordered fresh lemonade in other places and even made some of my own and I have never encountered anything as sharp - it seemed to be almost neat lemon juice with not even the slightest hint of sweetness. To eat we both chose scrambled eggs and smoked salmon. This was slow to arrive despite being simple to make - other tables whose orders were taken after ours were served sooner even though the cafe (and restaurant which is on the other side of the courtyard) wasn't that busy. When the salmon/eggs did arrive it looked rather un-appetizing: the eggs were grey-ish as though cooked in a pan with dirty oil, although it tasted ok. The smoked salmon was in flakes rather than thin slices which was rather decadent but unfortunately it contained several bones. We finished with cafe latte which was well made but didn't really make up for the disappointment with the lemonade and eggs/salmon.I would definitely return to the Wallace Collection again to experience the full guided tour and see the upstairs galleries but I am wary of visiting the cafe again except maybe for a cup of tea or coffee."

This place has such potential that it is a tragedy this is not being realised due to what I can only assume is a lack of effective leadership and vision.When I visited the visitor experience was very poor indeed - I would rate it as the worst venue in London as far as quality of service to the customer is concerned. Staff were unfriendly, snobby, and gave the impression that they were doing you a favour by letting one of the 'commoners' visit their Museum. Indeed throughout the entire visit the universal impression gained was that the entire offer was begrudged and forced with staff looking down their noses at the visitors and some of the warders being downright rude in the way they spoke.The restaurant was reasonably well laid out but was spoiled by a lack of consistency in the quality of what was served (plates were different sizes for the same meal, cutlery was dirty and the soup was cold). The waiter was inattentive (we had to ask for the bill three times), exuded snobbery, and clearly felt that he was working at the Ritz rather than a publicly-funded visitor attraction.The collections were not displayed or interpreted to their full potential with a very traditional approach to presentation (think 3 decades behind other museums). Information was limited at best and objects were often impossible to identify properly. This museum clearly has serious problems behind the scenes and needs a massive shake-up to bring it into the 21st century.The staff on the galleries had no idea about active interaction with the customer, sitting slumped on their chairs and scowling at the visitors (one was asleep when I visited). The shop was limited in scope and the staff there did not offer assistance to customers actively.Would I recommend visiting? Strangely enough the answer is yes as the collections and building are worth a look in themselves. It is also worth visiting if you want to remind yourself how not to deal with customers and fancy a glance through the window of time into how museums used to be in the 1970s....On a more positive note the toilets were clean and well presented."

You roam from one room to another in a chateaux-visiting fashion, each furnished with exquisite objects of arts. It is easy to overindulge in its sumptuous richness, once you feel a little too full, head to the cafe. It is such a contrasting oasis. The high dome gives the much needed open space, soothing natural light and refreshing green trees, you can rest well and recharge leisurely. A little pricey, but the cafe offers delightful bites.The best of all, however, is the free daily guided tour. I had mine with Ms. Marie-Claude Elliot. So charming and witty, her presentation is a work of art in itself. The tour was highly entertaining, rich in fascinating information and insightful musings. It is the highlight of my London trip and no doubt the most enjoyable hour I had there. I cannot recommend the Wallace Collection highly enough. To be fair though, for many visitors who are not UK residents, this museum is low priority, if not easily skipped altogether. After all, this museum is undoubtedly more French than British. And understandably, people wonder why do French things while being in London for a limited time. However, if you are into excellence beyond expectations, this is perfect.Finally I would say it is not quite child-friendly. For visitors with children, I did not find anything catering to the young. Too many objects are within the reach of little hands, especially those that are highly curious, the parents might end up keeping their eyes fastened on their kids that they couldn't see much of anything else. The rather compact space neither helps, kids who like to move about might be frustrated being kept in tight tow.Big bonus: it is unbelievably free of charge. But after such an indulging visit, this is one place I bet you would feel highly merit the suggested donation."

The Wallace Collection will never match the National Gallery for selection, but I enjoy it far more because it offers charms that no large museum can match.For one thing, it displays art in the proper context. Artists never created works for the endless gallery of the mega museum. They created them either for churches or massive private residences like the one that houses the Wallace Collection. They intended their works to hang (or stand) with both furniture and with very different works and that is how you see them here.The second big advantage here is unity. Unlike large museums, which try to meld the often competing tastes of hundreds of curators over many generations, the Wallace Collection centers on the acquisitions of just two men. Visitors thus see more than great paintings, they feel the spirit of the men who built the collection and learn the traits that those men thought essential to great art. It's exciting to look at two very different pieces in the Wallace Collection, both bought by the same man, and suddenly see the uniting principle that caused the same guy to buy both.Truly brilliant."

This was a very enjoyable collection, great themes in the paintings and interesting furniture all splendidly set in the grand old family house. Not so much impressed by the current Damien Hirst exhibition or lunch - lovely atrium and coffee/cake fine, but we found the lunch food disappointing for the price and service was slow and offhand."

There are some amazing finds, from Madame Pompadour's Sevres china tea sets to jewelry from the medieval era to an astounding collection of armory and portraits. There is something for everyone's taste. And best of all, admission is free. They serve a wonderful tea, and you're not crowded. It was nice to be able to just be able to soak in the ambiance and take my time. I'm still sure I missed things, though, there's just that much to see. Set in the original house, you are spared the sterilised tour experience."

The pieces are over the top, but the layout within the home helps you to imagine what life for the privelage might have been like. After you've done all the typical tourist attractions, come to this musuem-its a gem for your London experience. And stay for the cafe! We had tea, but also saw families and business meetings happening in the atrium cafe."

You need to search it out and perhaps do a little walking or just get a cab.The children may well love it, fantastic collection of armour, paintings pottery etc everything, will take you way more time to see it all than you expect. Do allow at least 4 hours to visit, really great collection my family loved it and we will go again for sure and we live 6000 miles away"

You should go, even if you only pop in, (admission is free and its in the center of London, near to other tourist attractions), but there's a good chance you'll spend much longer than you planned for there. The collection and interior of the house are beautiful and magnificent. You can see Fragonard's 'The Swing'. I recommend looking at the website.http://www.wallacecollection.org/index.php"

As all the previous reviewers have said the collection is fantastic, however the quality and style of the d\u00e9cor and finish of all areas of the building is also to be admired. The museum has a restaurant in the enclosed courtyard offering excellent food at all times of the day and we will be back to this very stylish oasis just off Oxford Street many times to enjoy lunches or afternoon teas etc."

A hidden gem, tucked-away in a leafy square just behind Selfriges store on frenetic Oxford Street, but not to be missed.Personally,not enamoured by flouncy flashy French styles of art, but nevertheless entirely 'gobsmacked' by the sheer scale and quality on display here.Such an experience too to come face to face with Rembrandt's selfportrait as well as the Laughing Cavalier.Swish elegant covered - courtyard cafe too.FREE admission !Cannot recommend too highly !!"

The collection reflects the acquisitions by one family over 4 generations and it is immense. Yet the museum is quite manageable and friendly for a day's outing. All in all it is a quite intimate experience.The paintings themselves are lovely featuring Hals, Rembrandt, Titian, Boucher & Fragonard among others including a strong showing of Dutch & Fleming works. I especially enjoyed the collection of S\u00e8vres porcelain, one of the finest in the world, while partner spent his time viewing the amour. The museum has a restaurant in the enclosed courtyard, audio phones available for a donation, free admission, and knowledgeable room guides."

It helped that I was with people who knew a lot about the collection but well worth the visit even if you dont know everything about what is in there. Lots of boulle furniture, armor, sevre and paintings including the Swing. Must see!"

            "review": "A lovely surprise in London. I had heard of the Wallace Collection many times, but had never visited it in my many visits to London. Only now do I realize how much of an omission it was. The Collection is located in Hertoford House, a beautiful mansion in Manchester Square, in the heart of London. It contains mostly French XVII and XVIII century objets d'art, such as vases of Sevres porcelain, Titian portraits, seventeenth century bronze statuettes, XVIII and XIX century miniatures, just to mention a few examples. It is a paradise for anyone who appreciates the decorative arts. It is definitely a must see.In addition, there is a new restaurant on the premises, fashioned after a typical French brasserie. It offers main dishes, like seabass, steak tartar, etc. It also has an array of terrines, cheeses, platters of oyster, clams, and prawns. On the way out make sure you survey the scene around Manchester Square. The park is lush green even in late winter, and surrounded by XIX century mansions (although none as large as the one where the collection is housed). In short, the Wallace Collection is a gem. I can't wait to get back. Anna L. Josephs"

I love this museum: the basis of the collection seems to have been 'is it for sale and do I have my wallet with me', but this means that it is full of suprises and after several visits I am still finding new treasures. It is pretty crammed, but the relatively small size of the house means that you can whisk around quite quickly, or just speed along to your favourite area before gallery fatigue sets in (anyone trying to do the National gallery in a short visit will know what I mean). The acid test: I took daughters 12 and 14 along, in the middle of a shoping trip, last week - despite initial 'we'll endure it for the sake of her credit card' looks, they really enjoyed it (and it is not too far from the coffee shops of Marylebone High Street. for a recovery break) The youngest has now developed a facination with minatures (of which there is a very good selection) I've been trying to persuade my husband to pop along in his lunch hour to see the armoury - not my area of interest but a good example of the amazing range of subjects on view. A friend and I spent a quick post lunch visit playing 'spot the painting that you recognise as a book cover illustration'. The restaurant is lovely - surely one of the best settings in London, but was closed when we visited on 1st September, being apparently refitted. Hope the food remains as good as I have expereinced - memorable risotto. My 2nd favourite gallery after the Courtauld in Somerset House. And it's free."

Visited the Wallace Collection for the first time this weekend, despite living locally for many years.Hertford House is a beautiful 18th Century building, and there are lots of stunning objets d'art. The highlights for me were the Laughing Cavalier and the overly ornate French furniture.Given that there's free admission, you really have no excuse not to while away an hour or two at the Collection."

Yes, there is plenty of third-rate art and an overabundance of objects d'art scattered throughout the Wallace, but there are also occasional gems - paintings, minatures, armor and furniture. The Wallace also gives the visitor a good impression how the later Victorian and Edwardian elite in London actually lived. Plan to spend 90 minutes here, and then do some shopping on nearly Oxford Street."
