We began with a tour of the outer market, learning about the stalls and buying fish and ingredients for our workshop. Next, we went into the inner market, and all I can call it is a fascinating world of fish!Our last stop was our kitchen to learn about filleting fish, preparing sushi, and tasting our handiwork. Seriously some of the best fish I've ever eaten!We also opted for an extra sake tasting menu, and loved it. The whole workshop was so much fun, and the guys who run it are friendly, funny and so knowledgeable about the market and about what makes delicious sushi.If you love sushi, I wholeheartedly recommend the Tsukiji Sushi Insider Workshop. Go with a healthy appetite, enjoy the fabulous food and soak up the awesome knowledge of your chef and guides :)"

            "review": "Tsukiji market is an interesting place. We did the auction tour which involved getting to the market at 2.30am for an auction at 6am that lasted about 30 mins. What was worth paying for was the tour guide translating how the market runs and the inner secrets of the market. It also turned out the tour guide helps the security with translation too! The waiting time of 3 hours was spent sitting cramped with other humans like sardines on a hard wooden floor that was in a building next to the market. How ironic! I would recommend wearing pants or shorts and a cushy bum! The auction itself was very interesting and eye opening but we could only see it for about 30 mins. Then the rest of the tour involves walking around the market, visiting some shops. However, it was pretty dangerous as carts drive past you and the people in the market are pretty anti-tourists so it was a big change from the usually friendly Japanese people. The outer market was a lot friendlier tho and we managed to try sake and green tea. Our guide also recommended this amazing sushi restaurant where we had sushi breakfast and were stuffed by 8am. Overall, a great experience but a bit pricey. However, I would still do it again."

We had a great time during this four-and-a-half-hour tour through the Tsukiji Fish Market and the sushi workshop that followed. Getting a glimpse of the fish market while many buyers were still there and before it opened to the general public was a big selling point for me. It was interesting to see that tourists and cameras were not particularly welcome - for obvious reasons. But our guide told us exactly where we could photograph and where not, so thanks for that. Definitely super interesting. The workshop was also great. We could see every step from the live fish to the sushi pieces on our plates. Absolutely delicious and recommended!"

We had the best day at Tsukiji Fish Market up at 6am to get the train from Shinjuku we met with the young guide chef and translator and explored the market which would have been lethal without a guide, we also had samples of cheese and saki from some wonderful vendors and sampled cooked crickets and goodness knows what else. After choosing the fish we needed we went to a little building with three other holiday makers. The chef showed us how to prepare and gut the fish we had chosen prior to making our own sushi fromSea bream, yellow fin,mackerel, tuna, scallops with a selection of saki. Amazing day."

My wife and I tried to visit Tsukiji market the morning we arrived in Tokyo, and even though we had done a lot of research, we left feeling like we didn't really see or experience what it was all about. Then on our Mt. Fuji hike we met a couple that raved about this tour and said we had to try it, so we booked it the night we got back to Tokyo and we are so happy we did!We did the 8am market tour and sushi making class, and it was fantastic! Going through the market with an experienced guide makes all the difference, and seeing the inner market as we did will be a lifetime memory. The class was super fun, the chef was awesome, the food was phenomenal and every bit of the experience felt like it was catered to our exact wishes. I am so happy that couple recommended this tour, because otherwise we would have left Tokyo without these amazing memories."

It's easy to go to Japan to gorge on sushi and sashimi, but I think you gain another level of appreciation of the food when you know how it is being caught, handled, distributed and finally served on your plate.For the tour, you will need to arrive by 2:30am. I arrived a bit late and was told by security that the quota has been filled and to leave. Luckily the tour guide has good relationship with security and was able to hold my spot. However, it seems I could've lost it if I arrived even later. Around 4pm, one of the buyers will come in to give a run through of what usually happens during the auction. This was an excellent Q&A opportunity with an insider, so be prepared with some good questions.Be careful when walking around because the place is made for business and not for tourists. Bring some cash to buy the fresh goodies at the insider market and for breakfast!! It's a good place to splurge on food because you know it is FRESH!!"

The wait in the room with 120 other people was a little brutal but I just took a quick nap on the ground (bring a plastic bag so you can lay not he ground). I booked their Tuna Auction tour. My guide, Katsuhiko, was awesome. He knows everyone!!!! He got me the best position for the auction and then got me into the inner market and met with a bunch of wholesalers and workers. I really got an insider look at how the fish market works. Also, don't waste time standing in the ridiculous line at Sushi Dai, there are so many other great places to get your sushi fix at the market. Great experience!!!!"

            "review": "One of the best activities in Tokyo. We did this sushi class and tour in Tokyo on our second day and it remained one of the highlights for our whole trip to Japan. My two kids (4 & 8) absolutely loved the whole experience. It was very informative from the beginning tour of the outside fish market, then inside the fish market, and finally the sushi class and tasting. You get to learn about each step of sushi making from how the fish is selected, to what exactly they do to the fish to keep it fresh (a bit gruesome to watch for first-timers), to how a fish is properly cut, and finally how a proper Nigiri is made and eaten. It's more than just sushi making since you get an escorted tour of the inside of the fish market before the general public is allowed to enter. The inside part of the fish market is a bit crazy and quite dangerous with all the trucks and sharp things moving around, I cannot imagine moving through there without a Japanese speaking tour guide. I would encourage people to do this tour soon since the fish market is moving to a new location in October I believe. This is the original location of the fish market and a must see. Overall, this was an awesome experience with the freshest sushi we tasted in all of Japan (even more fresh than the high-end restaurant we ate at called Kyubey)!"

We arrived at the visitor facility at 230am and weren't excited to wait until 5am for the auction. The wait was worth it! Katsuhiko translated the auction and provided a exciting play-by-play experience. The market has so much history and is really a fish distribution power house. After the auction finished, while the other members of the free fish market tour went on their way, we went on an awesome tour of the market. It was a top-notch VIP experience."

            "review": "An Exceptional Way to Visit Tsukiji Market. My family of five spent a lovely morning with the team at the Sushi Insider Workshop as part of our visit to Tsukiji Market in Tokyo. For 95% of us who love food and adventure but don't really know how to filet a fish, prepare the basics around sashimi or sushi making or just to intimidated to ask your local, passionate sushi chef, this is a fine adventure. The $150 pp price tag is quite expensive relative to visiting the market on your own. However, given the ability to access several areas of the market before the public (just changed to 10am by the way, effective July 1st), the fact that a skilled, knowledgeable sushi chef with an excellent translator is on hand to talk through his morning purchases, and that you will undoubtedly eat more fresh, exceptional raw fish in a one hour period (the big finish), it is an experience very worthwhile.I found the tour team, led by the young entrepreneurial owner, to be professional, passionate and inviting. Every question found an answer. Every palate was satisfied, even my daughter who HATES raw fish. Long story for another day.The tour team also operates an auction tour and because of their connections throughout the market (I saw lots of access happening with security and other inner market vendors because of their solid relationships), being the very first in line at 3 am is not 100% necessary, if you book the tour company's small group (less than 10 people) visit. Again, I did not attend the auction so I could not give you any insight.But I would give a hearty big thumbs up to Sushi Insider Workshop for a fun filled morning and afternoon making sushi. If you are a michelin starred chef or on The Food Network, this is too basic for you. But for the 95% of us that crave travel adventure but want a little hand holding, this is a very fine tour."

            "review": "Insider Access... Highly Recommended. Kicked off our recent trip to Tokyo with fish auction tour and sushi workshop. Fresh off the plane only a few hours prior we walked to Tsukiji Fish Market building at 2:00 in the morning to meet up with Katsuhiko by 2:30am. We were informed by Tsubasa a few days prior that the meeting time had been changed from 3:30am to 2:30am because of the increasing numbers of people lining up for tours (Tsubasa does an excellent job communicating and organizing everything and even sends pictures at the end). With reservation we trudged on as visiting the fish market before it moves in November was the primary reason for the trip. To our surprise there were already people in line when we arrived and by 3:18am all 120 slots for the day had been given out.... I should not have doubted them\u2026 they certainly know their stuff! They are there everyday, know the market inside and out and are friendly with the vendors. In fact, Katsuhiko personally knows many of the security guards and even helps direct the tourists! He informed us of the best place to stand for the auction and told us what was going on as it was happening. He even took pictures of us, recommended places to eat and most importantly, took us into the inner market around 7:00-7:30am when there was still lots and lots of action going on and introduced us to some of the sellers and dealers. This is the REAL value of the tour! Normally the public (including other advertised tours) don't get access to the inner market until 9am when most of the action has died down. I know this first hand, because for the second part of the tour we signed up for the sushi making workshop and joined up with the rest of our family, getting to enter the market again at 8:30am to buy fish for the workshop and by then it was not quite the same experience\u2026 still good\u2026 but not AS good.Shopping with Morita san, watching him choose the fish and then having him give a step by step demonstration of the preparation is priceless; we even got to try slicing the fish ourselves. Their set up, located directly in the market place is super convenient. Morita san was very good with the kids and even gave us a few special treats. Making sushi is much harder than it looks but it was a fun and tasty experience with more than enough food. The food was excellent but the company even better. These guys are outstanding and top notch\u2026 professional and personable. By the end of the experience they kind of felt like family and I would not hesitate one bit to recommend them to my friends and family!"

            "review": "Great way to end in Tokyo. My sons and I were traveling in Japan for 6 days. Before our trip, I reserved this workshop for 4 people. We arrived at the meeting point, easy to find with signs and two or three people waiting for us. Gathered into a fairly large group of 13, but split into 3 groups so never felt crowded. Short walk to busting inner market. We first get to a vendor (fish monger) where we are shown several of the fish we will be eating a few hours later. They are still alive and then prepared in a style that allows for fresh sushi taste. We then spend time going though the market and seeing an amazing array of fish and sea life. So very sad to see this move in November but so happy to be one of the last to be able to experience this. We make it to the sushi studio, small air conditioned apartment on the third floor of the outer market. There we watch the preparation of nearly a dozen fish for our lunch. Hands on preparation allowed but the sushi master guided the entire way. Fresh wasabi ground by hand on shark skin paddle. Then we learn how to hand roll our own sushi or try sashimi style. Just fantastic. Even if you don't like the people on your tour you really are in your own group so great. Way more food than you can finish or need. The only thing I would suggest is actually LESS fish so as it doesn't go to waste. Great 4 hours and then to Narita back home!"

My friend and I took the tour in May and learned SO MUCH about Japanese culture and how they prepare their food. It was interesting to walk through the market and learn how to properly pick the right fish (I would've never been able to do this on my own!). After touring the Tuskiji fish market, we went back to a private kitchen to learn how to prepare our fish for sushi. We paid extra to have sake (trust me, it's worth it -- their sake selection is DELICIOUS!) and made a delicious meal with the fish we picked out from the market. Overall, I highly recommend this workshop. I had an amazing time - thank you to our guide and chef for the laughter and great food!"

I am loathe to make criticisms of a business with so many great reviews, but the truth is that my friend and I were truly disappointed at this experience. I am only hoping that my review will save someone the money that I regret spending on this so called 'sushi workshop'. Just to be clear, I am not disputing the customer service, I am unhappy with the fact that it was not what they advertised it to be. On their website, the workshop state \"The half-day workshop we at the Tsukiji Sushi Workshop are offering is aimed at people wanting to know not only how to prepare sushi, but everything from learning about the procurement of ingredients to presentation.\"The tour of the market wasn't bad, it just lacked a lot of vital information. The guide who was perfectly polite, as most Japanese are, didn't give any background or info about the market not even that it's the largest in the world, etc. He did point out some interesting things like sea urchin and fish roe, but if you are into Japanese food I would have though most people know what that looks like anyway. The guide functioned mostly as a translator. The most disappointing part of the so called sushi workshop was that it was entirely about assembling nigiri sushi - we didn't even cook the rice or get to cut the fish. If you already know the basics of how to fillet a fish, then the fish part did not offer much insight either. I notice one reviewer mentioned that the chef showed them how to position themselves at the bench and how to slice the fish but we did not get any of that. We also did not learn how to cook the sushi rice, it was purchased at the market and all we got to do was form the rice and fish into nigiri. A YouTube video could show you how to do that and you could practice yourself for a lot less than US$150. When I asked the guide if he could explain how to make sushi rice, he said that he would email us the recipe IF we wrote a TripAdvisor review. This is blatantly in violation of TripAdvisor's policy on incentivising reviews. If you are a foodie and already know the basics of how to select fresh fish (let's be honest all the fish at this market are fresh) and how to fillet a fish, this workshop is not for you. I truly though the workshop was a waste of money - use the $25 to buy yourself a great sushi lunch and $125 to buy yourself a nice Japanese made knife that you can keep instead."

Our group was on the larger side (10 people), so we were split up to better maneuver through the market. We shadowed the chef as he went to his favorite vendors in both the inner and outer markets and made his selections. We learned not only how the market worked, but how to pick the freshest, best tasting fish. A fish monger also showed us how he killed and prepped the fish to be taken home. When we had made all our purchases, we convened at the kitchen where the chef showed us how to make nigiri sushi. Then we were each provided with a good portion of sliced fish and a bowl of sticky sushi rice to make (and eat) our own. It was some of the best sushi I have ever had and I had A LOT of it. The meal finished with a cup of rich fish broth made with the leftover bones. Delicious.All in all, it was a fantastic, informative, interactive tour and I would highly, highly recommend it."

I highly recommend the morning offering of the sushi workshop because you also get to walk around the Inner Market before the general public is allowed to. The day I did the tour, I was the only one who signed up, so it was like having a private tour. Chef Morita-san and translator Kaieda-san asked what kinds of fish I liked and customized the menu around that \u2013 I also told them \u2018omakase\u2019 if they saw something that looked good. One of the first things we did was to buy real wasabi root at a stall in the outer market \u2013 definitely a good start to the tour. Then we got to see the inner market. We got cherry salmon, first bonito of the season, yellowtail, and flounder (or a fish similar to flounder). Even though I was the only guest, they still bought enough fish for a whole group! I even got to see the special way to butcher one of the live fish that we prepared later.Back at the studio, Morita-san prepared the fish into fillets. At the same time, he created a tasty fish stock with the remaining bones. I tried my hand at some of the sogi-giri cuts to make nigiri sushi \u2013 I definitely will need more practice. He also showed how to shape the sushi. There was so much fish, and he also served up some fire-roasted (via blowtorch) slices of the fish. To finish off this great meal, he served up a cup of piping hot fish stock. A great way to experience Tsukiji and sushi!"

Joined this Sushi Work Shop with my American husband and a friend from the SF Bay Area. All of us are foodies and keen amateurs. We are extremely happy that we made it before Fish market moves to Toyosu location. The lesson starts with the shopping inside the fish market, which is an exciting rare experience as well. You can learn the professional secrets - inherited Japanese knowledge and skills how to deal with the fish. No doubt eye-opening experience even for a Japanese. The hands-on lesson inside the classroom is very well organized. Starting with chef's demonstration, followed by volunteer hands on trial to de-born and slice the fish. We did scallops, too, out of shells. Then all the participants can make your own nigiri on your table. We enjoyed good sake as optional choice. Great choice of sake. Never crappy. Chef Morita-san is very friendly and experienced to share the tips how to position yourself against the counter top and and how to use the Japanese sashimi knife. Hayashi-san and Kaieda-san were very knowledgeable and helpful as well. They also shared the good Sushi place they recommend, which was a big bonus, too. Overall, very valuable experience and so happy we did ! Highly recommended for foodies keen about hands-on lessons, but also never compelling pressures even if you just wish to observe, hands-off and eat Sushi !"

Only one in our party actually ate raw fish (my husband), but I wanted to see the market and have our kids experience it as well. We discussed this in advance and they indicated they would have other options available for us to eat. A day or two before the tour, they sent a reminder email with directions for a taxi in Japanese kanji as well as the subway meeting point. This was very appreciated as we got a late start the morning of and ended up hoping a taxi. Unfortunately, despite giving the driver the instructions in Japanese, the taxi dropped us at the wrong location. Panicked we called the numbers provided and they came and found us once we were able to describe our location. Whew!  I thought based on the emails from them that mainly dealt with the tuna auction (we did the sushi making in the morning) that it would be a humongous group. It was not, as there were only 10 in our group, which was a great size and then they broke the group in 2 as we walked through the market. They explained what we were seeing along the way, and walked us through to the inner market. We were there right before the general public could get in, so things had calmed down a bit, but were still crazy busy. It was very interesting to watch the merchants at work, mini forklifts darting all over, preparing seafood, and in general see how it all functioned.  Back at the kitchen area (studio) was where it was really fun, listening to and watching how to prepare a fish, learning about what is in season, learning about Japanese customs surrounding it all, just so interesting. When they noticed our kids didn\u2019t have anything to eat, they ran downstairs and bought both veggies and meat for them. They also \u2018cooked\u2019 with a blowtorch some delicious cherry salmon for me to eat. They were very accommodating, fascinating to listen to and the combination of backgrounds of the folks leading our tour gave us what was the highlight of our trip to Japan for my sushi loving husband. Don\u2019t hesitate for a second to book with these guys."

I wanted to eat Uni (Sea Urchin) so they showed me how to pick the best Uni, which was purchased for the sushi making course. They showed me the different grades of tuna and how the fishmonger would prepare the fish. Later, at the workshop, the chef taught me how to use the knife and slice the tuna. I had a guided tour in the outer fish market (where they showed me how to choose the wasabi root) and the inner fish market (where we saw all different types of seafood including puffer fish, which I was interested in seeing alive). Since we had some extra time, the guide showed me how to pray in the Japanese shrine nearby. It was such a wonderful experience - a really important part of the cultural experience! I would do it again and recommend others to attend this workshop."

We truly felt like locals walking around the market with our wonderful guides who are not only extremely friendly but also a treasure trove of knowledge about not only seafood but also the history of Tsukiji Market. They were also extremely generous with the variety and quantity of food provided, way beyond our expectations. We were lucky to land right at the tail end of the Cherry Salmon season (delicious) and got to taste some amazing Blood Clams and massive Kuruma Shrimp that were so fresh they slapped you in the face when bit. We also had some delicious tuna (from South Carolina) and I believe skate or flounder. Being a rice lover though, the highlight was certainly the delicious rice, cooked just right and seasoned so well I'm unsure I will ever get to taste something of that level again. Do yourself a favour and head over to Tsukiji... It apparently won't be there for long now since it's moving to a new building."

He took us on a tour of the inner and outer markets and we picked up different types of fish for later- we got cherry salmon, tuna, seared squid, black clams, and flounder. The market is super interesting and you need a guide for the inner markets, so this was helpful. We took the fish back to the kitchen, in a building in the outer market where the chef met us. He skinned, gutted, and cleaned all of the fish and chopped up a bunch into sushi and let us try when we wanted to -- it is much harder than it looks! We took tons of pictures throughout and were able to taste the sushi while he was preparing it. You even get to grind the wasabi root! After everything is chopped up, we sat down and the chef taught us how to put the sushi pieces together with the rice - also not so easy! We changed off eating sushi and making it and there was plenty of food - I've probably never eaten so much sushi in one sitting and it was the freshest fish I've ever tasted! The chef made a bunch of pieces for us too so that we were able to enjoy it and not spend all our time making it if we wanted his help. Highly recommend!!! Super friendly staff, intimate experience, very professional and fun."

We had our own private guide, who was absolutely lovely and ensured that we had the best experience, leading us to the best viewing point of the tuna auction, the best photo points and explaining the entire process to us in well-spoken English. Following the Tuna Auction, we were shown the Fish Market. Most foreigners and individuals who do not work at the Fish Market are not allowed access until 9am. However due to special connections, we were allowed to walk through the market at 6am, with no other tourists there! It was amazing. Following the unique experience, we ran into the talented sashimi chef on his way into the market to buy fresh produce for the sushi making class that would start in an hour. The Chef was funny and interactive and everyone had a go at cutting the sashimi and learning how to slice it in the correct manner. After we did the sashimi slicing, we started making the rice into the special shape needed to be able to sit under the sashimi. It was so much fun and the staff were so attentive and friendly. Not only that, but the other guests on the tour were from America, South Africa, Australia, you name it - this great company is bringing in culturally interested individuals from all over the world. Finally, to make the day even better, there was a Sake buffet! Unlimited Sake, all different types, to drink with the sashimi. It was an extremely memorable experience that my boyfriend and I shared, and we are so so glad we decided to get up early, do the Tuna Auction, see the famous Fish Market and make sushi and sashimi as well as new friends.

They lead us to an apartment nearby and showed us how to clean the fish in a way suitable for sushi -- which was much more involved than I was used to and felt more like an autopsy which was really cool and eye-opening. Next, they taught us how to form the nigiri and grind the wasabi. The main focus of the class was on preparing the fish and forming the nigiri -- we did not make the rice or slice the fish which we were perfectly fine with. We were completely full after eating the sushi and half of it was left-over. They neatly packaged the sushi and sent it home with us along with a bottle of the chef's homemade soy sauce! We expressed interest in buying a knife and they took the time afterwards to introduce us to the knife store and owner. We decided not to purchase one but appreciated the gesture.

The price for this is also quite reasonable as you will have more than enough to eat to go along with the experience.We were fortunate to have the day to ourselves (2 of us) with the class being taught by a sushi chef and a translator for English speakers. His English is excellent and the two work extremely well together (We had Hirobumi Morita as our chef). The fish are selected based on the types you like, what is fresh in the market, and what the chef finds interesting. We had fatty tuna (better than any I've had in the US), Japanese Barracuda (smaller than most species and delicious), scallop, blood clam, baby sardines...and I think flounder and a snapper variety. At each step, the technique was demonstrated and we were given the opportunity to cut as much as we wanted. The instructions were great and you really have the ability to control how much you work and how much you watch.Rice was brought in from a rice vendor across the street and it was very well prepared. The recipe is provided for that as well. Plating was a fun experience and it really lets you do what you want from single rolls to nigiri to sashimi. The chef even brought out a torch to bring some extra flavor to a few of the pieces and so we could see the difference...a must try on the fatty tuna.This was a really great way to see the sushi process from start to finish, and you really start to appreciate the work that goes into good sushi. The fish you use in the workshop is excellent quality and extremely fresh -- The barracuda are fairly uncommonly used in the class but he was able to find some that were fresher than usual. One of the main reasons I would recommend pairing this with the tuna auction+tour that they offer is that the market is a completely different world once non-vendors are allowed access (workshop fits this time slot). The auction part allowed us to get access beforehand and there was a much larger variety and more activity at that point (6-8am)."

The tour leaders and sushi chef were extremely pleasant, accomodating and fun to learn from! They even took a couple people to a knife store they recommended to help us buy knives. This course is even more fun if you have skills filleting fish or good kitchen knife skills in advance as you will have the opportunity to do as much cutting of the raw fish as you like!"

We wouldn't have been able to see the fish market otherwise. On top of that we would have been lost in the market by ourselves. We really enjoyed learning how to break down a fish from whole fish to filets. I also really liked eating fresh ginger and grinding my own wasabi - who knew it was a plant?!"

Our guides were incredibly knowledgeable, telling us how to pick out the best fish for sushi and sashimi. They knew just about everyone in the inner market, and so we got shown a few insider's tips as well. It would have been easy to get lost in the maze of the market, or run over by one of the many carts that were zipping around. Our guides kept us safe by reminding us that it is first and foremost a working environment, and that we should try to stay out of the way of the workers and traders. After touring the inner market and parts of the outer market to buy our lunch ingredients, we headed back to the 'classroom' to make the sushi. Both our chefs were wonderful, showing us the best and most efficient way to prepare the different fish. The group were really fun, and we were all laughing and chatting while we made and ate our sushi.I had been a little bit nervous about attending the class solo, but Tsubasa took the time to speak with everyone both individually and as a group, which helped put me at ease.I would highly recommend this workshop."

The workshop taught my wife and I a lot of about the craftsmanship that goes into sushi making. The guides, Tsubasa and Morita, were very gracious in helping us foreigners learn about their culture and craft. Morita was obviously very skilled in picking out his fish and in his preparation of fish.There was a LOT to take in but it was fascinating to learn the differences in seasonal fish, how to find the right ones, and how to prepare each one for sushi. We should have brought a camcorder!We mainly learned to make nigiri so if you're looking to make something like California rolls or other Western rolls like that, this is not the right place. This workshop is all about Japanese style sushi so it's good to keep an open mind and palate.The best part about the whole thing is that we got to know our guides, Tsubasa and Morita really well that it felt like we were leaving our friends behind when the class was over. If you ever get a chance, ask Morita about the one time he almost died from eating pufferfish. It is a fantastic story!"

Being sushi lovers from Australia, we read the reviews on trip advisor and heard stories about this unique tour. It was fantastic and the guides Tsubasa and Sushi expert Hirobumi showed us an awesome day, with quality english interpretation and throwing in the odd joke or two. We begun by being guided through the marketplaces, both the outer and the inner market, and learning about the local produce, meeting different vendors and gaining an understanding of the area and its purpose. Once inside the main market we were able to learn about the seasonal fish and seafood, handling and the art behind picking the right one. After all of this, you take the produce back to the kitchen and the fun begins, sushi making! Even for us rookies, we seemed to get a hold of it pretty quickly. Slicing the fish was heaps of fun and I highly recommend this if your visiting Tokyo. Thanks for an awesome day."

I have also taken a sushi making class before, but this class focused on the cutting of the fish, which is, for me, the more difficult aspect of the process since it is something that one hesitates to practice at home. I will definitely take this class again when I next go to Tokyo. I have already recommended it to several friends. I would recommend this to both those who never cook and to those who are experienced home cooks.If you like to take photos, then definitely bring your camera. There are a lot of things you will want to photograph, both at the market and during the workshop. Wear sneakers. Don't wear sandals or shoes that you would not want to get a little messy from walking around a place where there is a lot of water on the ground and that water may have a little runoff from cutting up fish."

If you ever wondered what goes on before that exquisite piece of nigiri sushi ends up on your geta during an omakase meal, this is a must do on your agenda for Tokyo. The Tsukiji fish market needs no introduction, but navigating the labyrinthean innards of the wholesale section is made that much easier with good guides Morita-san and Tsubasa-san. Of course, being the consummate foodie and aspiring home cook myself, I got a chance to pick and choose which seafood items we wanted for our sushi making experience, then followed the experts as we hunted down our assortment of live and live finished catch of the day. Learning how to shuck, clean and process the seafood for the day was very informative and instructional with experienced chef Morita-san. For the class that day, we ended up with hirame, suzuki, akagai, kaki, otoro and akami. During the process, the more squeamish were content to watch the live entertainment as scaling, filleting, skinning, cleaning and slicing went on. However, the organizers are very welcoming to participants, and for those with an interest in the culinary arts, this is where you get more than your money's worth. All in all, I highly recommend this for anyone with an interest in cooking, even if you're not going to run off and host sushi parties. Just the skill sets of choosing and processing seafood would be a great takeaway from this class. For those who want an informative guide and an authentic local experience, this fares pretty well too!"

His expertise was apparent and he managed the group well. Morita sprung into action during the shopping of the inner market. So many fish, so little time. The sushi workshop allowed time for two chefs (Morita +one) to demo their skills and then invite participants to try their hand at fish scaling and filleting. My kid did us proud! Lastly, we got to make our own little nigiri with a dab of freshly grated wasabi (Tsubasa's touch) and lay on slices of five different fishes.

Once we got the fishes, they showed us how to prepare the fishes, by removing the bones and slicing the fishes. Definitely not easy! Some of us got to try the slicing of the fishes. After the fishes were prepared, we got down to preparing the sushi itself. We learned the techniques of kneading the rice into the correct shape using our hands and placing the fish on the rice. The chefs were very friendly and would patiently teach us. Good for those who are interested to learn making sushi from the natives."

He made sure we were in the right place at the right time, made sure we had a great viewing position, and most importantly, explained and translated the auction for us.. (so we actually knew the prices the fish were going for). Afterwards he took us through the internal market which was phenomenal! We saw such an amazing variety and quantity of fish, including seeing the giant Tuna being filleted with the large \"Maguro bocho\" knives (think Sword).We bought some wonderfully fresh scallops and sea urchin, which we ate for breakfast (prepared for us by a local restaurant alongside some other wonderful sashimi)An incredible experience.Notes: 1. Inside we saw whale meat openly for sale. I didn't expect it to be so open.2. I do warn you to wear shoes/pants than you don't mind get a bit wet/fishy if you venture into the internal market. (It is a busy place and the people there are busy working so you might brush against them)"

I\u2019ve had countless meals and sushi since I returned to the states, but nothing remotely compares to what I had at this cooking class. We first started off the cooking class by making a trip to the market at around 8:30am. Tsubasa and Mr. Morita were both extremely welcoming and friendly and knowledgeable about the market and industry. As we walked around the market, the two of them explained how to pick good fish as well as the history and general mannerisms of the fish market. Mr. Morita has been a chef in the area for many years, so he knew everyone \u2013 literally shadowing a local for a few hours in both the inner and outer fish market. Tsubasa and Mr. Morita were especially good at taking into account what I wanted to eat, and we ended up picking scallops (still in the shell and oh so delightful), tuna (didn\u2019t know tuna this good existed on Earth) and sea bass (cannot stop thinking about the sweet richness). The cooking class after we picked out the fish was extremely comprehensive, and I learned how to skin the fish, descale it, clean it, cut it, and make sushi with it. My teachers were extremely patient and the filled with laughter; eating, making sushi, more eating and lots of jokes in between, I felt not only to have learned so much, but also to have made new friends \u2013 a true cultural exchange. What an amazing and unforgettable experience. I love that I was able to share this tradition and art and integrate myself into the culture. Definitely a highlight to my trip \u2013 thank you for making this possible!"

We started by visiting the inner market with Morita-san and Tsubasa-san (the sushi chef and translator/guide), learning about how to pick which fish to buy (each fish can be different), and about preserving them in the right way for making the tastiest sushi. Afterwards, we headed to a communal kitchen where we learned to fillet each fish, and finished by making our own sushi lunches!Both Morita-san (the sushi chef) and Tsubasa-san (the translator) were fantastic.

Even though we go at the end of the market hours and there are lots of tourists with cameras, it's an incredible experience. So many fishes you never knew existed, huge slabs of tuna, beautiful uni, it goes on for row after row into the dimly lit distance. Tsubasa was knowledgeable and friendly, showed us lots of great stands, and then took us to buy fish. We learned about feeling the gills (deep red and slimy is good!) the color of the skin, how good squid reacts when you touch it. And then we were off to watch the filleting. After learning the differences in preparing sea bream, sea bass, flounder, blood clam, squid, and scallops (and tuna, but we had just bought a piece of a tuna, not the whole fish!), it was time to make the sushi. Some people had the discipline to make a whole plate of sushi before starting; I couldn't wait. Make a piece, eat it. Pleasant staff, a fun group of people on the tour - it was a lot of fun."

Yuka is wonderful and gave lots of insight on Japanese sushi making culture but there were a couple of downsides to her class. The class started at 9am and until around 2.30pm when we started to eat what we made no drinks or snacks were served for the students. I have been to multiple cooking classes around the world and they usually consist of tasting ingredients/ elements along the way and at least water is availible. We also found that the quantities of ingredients were very stingy, for example not everyone got cucumber/other ingredients as there were not enough. The sushi making was only the last hour of the class, with not a lot of explainations. The students did not get to stir the rice to cool it down, we had to use clear wrap between our hands and the rice instead of learning the real way etc. It was a nice day and don't regret going, just hoped that more sushi making would be happening.

I'm glad I went ahead and booked. Yuka was great about answering all my questions and was very quick in her response times. Payment was a breeze with paypal. The meeting point was easy to find and Yuka is very personable, putting everyone at ease and made us feel welcome in her home. Yuka entertained us the entire time with funny stories while still teaching us so much. The class was entertaining and I felt like I learned quite a bit. After class she took the time to show us how to properly sharpen knives on a stone and even walked with us to a local grocery store for an impromptu tour. I couldn't recommend this class more!"

My family and I enjoyed Yuka's Sushi workshop yesterday.Yuka was extremely friendly, explained clearly about the various ingredients, techniques, processes, do's and don'ts and ensured that every participant in our (small) group of six will practice hands on what they learnt.Eventually, before escorting us back to the Metro station Yuka was kind enough to offer to join us to a Supermarket tour, where she explained about various ingredients and answered many questions.A great experience, both for trained cooks as well as armatures."

The first experience I went along with a friend and together we made Sushi. The sushi making was tricky but Yuka soon made you feel like a pro and you left with recipes that you can make at home. The friend and I soon after made sushi for our other halves and they thoroughly enjoyed learning how to roll! Both my friend and I live in Japan(short term) and the learning about the ingredients and the shopping experience afterwards enabled us to have a much better understanding of Japanese cooking and how to navigate around a supermarket. The Gyoza cooking class I went alone but soon made friends. It was a just as fun and yummy experience. Yuka herself is great fun and makes you feel at ease. The groups are small and all the dishes that you make are to die for."

Our class had 7 people in total and it was at Yuka Mazda's house. Yuka was very thorough with her teaching and her english was superb. Instead of the normal places where they demonstrate most of the time, Yuka demonstrated and let us follow each step to make the sushi. It started from cooking the rice to fanning it and then shaping it to a sushi. The experience is expensive however it is well worth it. You actually spend about 4 hours with her and she also provides recipes to you after the class. Unfortunately we lost the recipes while we were travelling but we still have a very clear idea what was taught which is amazing. She was even nice enough to show us ingredients at a nearby supermarket after the class and dropped us off at the nearest subway station. What a blast we had. We would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys eating and cooking. Not to miss, we ate all the sushi we made and had miso soup and the appetizer Yuka made ahead of time. Thanks Yuka."

So many cooking classes work in 'stations' where you hear all of the lessons but only get to try the pieces assigned to you. Not in this class. In this class, you make your own sushi from start to finish under Yuka's careful guidance. Even if you never made sushi again, you still learn everything you need to know about eating sushi -- what to watch for and how to eat it authentically. And after the class, Yuka even took us to the grocery so we could learn what ingredients to use in a number of dishes. Worth every penny and more!"

Would have been easier just getting a taxi there (not that im lazy!)? Or using GPS to get there ourselves?We did the sushi class and have been on other cooking classes in different countries and always enjoyed them.The biggest downside is that like many Tokyo apartments Yuka only has 1 cooker, which means most of the class is her talking about what shes doing and you watching. Maybe portable cookers so everyone can cook?We were eventually able to roll some sushi, about 2 hours into the class but i dont really know what was in it as i didnt make it... Just figured id read the recipe when we get home.We got about 20 minutes of rolling sushi in 3 hours and the rest was watching or talking?

Yuka is an amazing chef and her lesson is clear and funny! We really like it and we learn a lot of useful things to do sushi and miso soup. At the end of the course, Yuka took us in a super market and show us which things to buy... GREAT!!"

With top quality ingredients and maker-friendly recipes provided by Sensei, we can't believe that we can make tasty Beef Don, Miso soup and dumplings with a touch of Japanese style and flair. Food is truly a vista to a country's culture. From Yuka Sensei we learn not only the great way to prepare food but background knowledge of Japanese food, etiquette and culture. It's a class that helps us fall in love with Japan and her wonderful culture.Sensei was also kind enough to offer us loads of recommendation about having great food in Tokyo. We are lucky to have tried them all - never underestimate the taste buds of a great chef; our trip was enriched with rounds and rounds of gourmet.Sensei's lively presentation and very personal style made us feel very welcome.

She said she would meet us at the station at 10 a.m. and she arrived on time, almost to the second! It is a 10 min. walk to her house from the station during which you can get to know your fellow students. As other reviewers have mentioned, her English is excellent so that's a big relief. Coming to the class - you get to learn and practice a lot of techniques. How to slice the fish, make the sticky rice, make the soup, roll the sushi roll, etc. Everyone gets to practice the techniques. And it is not at all easy towards the end - especially when it comes to rolling the sushi rolls perfectly...I found it quite tricky. Japanese cuisine really is a lot about getting the technique and presentation right. But at the end of the class, when you finally get to see (and eat) all the delicious food you have prepared, it is definitely a great feeling. Would definitely recommend this class.Some things to keep in mind - this will take around 5 hours, so do keep that in mind while planning your trip. Also, make sure you keep up with the rest of the class, else you might find it difficult to follow the remaining steps (happened to me)."

Recommended for foodies or anyone looking for something a bit different."

I contacted Yuka with only 24 hours notice and she fitted us into the gyoza and beef class. She met us at rail station and we walked to her apartment. We had a lovely time cooking and talking to the other 5 students.We all had a turn at the various tasks and enjoys our meal very much. We learnt a lot about Japanese soy sauces and miso pastes and also about Japanese knives. A great way to spend 4 hours. Thank you Yuka for being such a great teacher and lots of fun too."

She constantly adapts the course to the tastes of the people visiting and is even excited to learn new English terms/phrases to improve her future interactions. The ingredients used for the class are of the highest quality (such that I'm not even sure if she runs it at a profit), and it goes without saying that the final product is delicious. Meeting Yuka was an absolute pleasure, and I cannot recommend this experience enough."

Yuka meet us all at the train station and then we walked to her house to begin our education in sushi making.I have no hesitation in recommending you take one of Yuka's classes - in fact in hindsight I wish we had taken more while we were in Tokyo - Thank you Yuka for making our visit one of the most memorable."

She met the 2 of us and 3 others at the train station before we walked to her apartment. We were lucky our class was small as we had previously read the sizes can vary significantly. We made gyoza and a Japanese beef dish. She used high quality ingredients and made sure all the students had turns in helping to prepare. The food was delicious and explanations were clear. She gave us the instructions to take home and even suggested alternatives to use back home if we couldn't find the correct ingredients. We were given miso, green tea and a Japanese dessert to accompany our prepared meal. After the class ended I asked where I could purchase some ingredients locally and she walked us to her local supermarket and gave us a tour of the place and showed us all the ingredients and explained the different types. It was a lovely experience and I would recommend it to friends who want a different way to experience Japan. The class lasts approx 4 hours."

We signed up to take Yuka's sushi class and it was the best decision ever. I emailed her to ask about availability and she replied right away, in perfect english. We signed up and she sent an email with instructions and her contact info. She met us at the ticket gate of the subway exit and we walked to her home. The class was amazing. She explained the difference between different ingredients, what to expect at different levels of restaurants, and answered every question we could fire at her. We laughed and learned and felt so welcome in her home. The final product was something you'd expect at the finest sushi restaurants. And the taste!!! You eat everything you prepare so come hungry as it is a lot of food. We took so many pictures and videos so that we can take Yuka home with us when we leave. She even sends you home with printed recipes too.And when it was all said and done, she took us to the grocery store and walked us through all of the important ingredients, and even beyond what we prepared. She spent almost 6 hours with us and we could have spent an entire day with her! Don't bother looking anywhere else. I promise you this is worth every dollar, and I would easily pay double for all that you get."

This is something you should definitely chose, if you are interested in Japanese cuisine, else you just get lost in the supermarket.It is also very kind of her that she comes and picks you up at the subway station, it helps you a lot, even if you are experienced finding your way around - which can be quite challenging in Tokyo."

My husband and I had taken a class elsewhere during a previous trip to Tokyo, but I was keen that this time our sushi-loving kids could try and learn to prepare some too. Yuka gave clear instructions and demonstrations in excellent English, and kept all 8 of us in the class fully involved with hands on preparation of the rolls and nigiri. She introduced us to ingredients I hadn't encountered before, and helped us with techniques - and the end results were delicious. Yuka is great company, clearly passionate about food and full of recommendations for places to eat and buy ingredients around Tokyo. After the class was over, she took us around a supermarket and helped us select some foods I would never have been able to identify left to my own devices! She was very generous with her time, which we really appreciated.I would definitely recommend this class as both very informative and enjoyable to families, couples and friends alike."

Yuka does not let you skip steps or allow you to passively go on to the next step even if your prior attempt was poor. She strives to be sure you understand what you are doing and if the last attempt didn't go well, she asked me to do it again like a wonderful teacher should.

Secondly, Yuka is equally inclusive of teenagers and adults, therefore the whole family was engaged in measuring amounts of rice, 9, 10 or 11 gr - those small amounts actually made every difference.

I also went with her to the supermarket after, DO THIS! She takes you through the whole place and it is worth it! Could not recommend more highly."

Must book in advance as classes have limited spots.This was my 2nd time visiting Japan and was really stuck on what to do. I was bound to Roppongi and couldn't venture out further. I did some research on nearby activities and found out about Yuka's class on TripAdvisor. After reading some positive reviews, I was adamant I should try it out. I decided to pick the Sushi class, because it's such a popular food here in Australia and I wanted to know how to make them...properly and from a local too.Yuka picked our group up from the station and it was an easy walk to her home. It was also amazing hearing about her about background and comforting to know that we'd be in good hands (she knows a lot about how to eat/eating really good food!!).As soon as we arrived at her house, we got straight into it. She uses the freshest ingredients and her classes are very easy to follow. A very hands on and interactive class - we made some pretty tasty sushi, miso and learnt about dashi broth. Dessert and delicious drinks were served after. Little Japanese everyday basics which was great to learn about. And you can tell Yuka was very passionate about sharing this with us!If you don't know anything about Japan, Yuka is very happy to share her culture with you! She added her own personal touch to our group's experience, by sharing her travel experiences with us, favourite restaurants and places to visit in Japan. One of the guests requested a visit to the local supermarket after the class. It was such an invaluable experience, learning about different ingredients, dishes and beverages that you'd find in a Japanese supermarket.Yuka was so lovely and such a knowledgeable teacher. She goes above and beyond in making each of her guests/students feel welcomed and cared for...from initial emails/communications, to the very end when we say our goodbyes. Thank you for making my experience in Japan very memorable and worthwhile, Yuka! I will be back for more classes :-)"

Everyone has the chance to slice the fish chunk and made their own sushi.Yuka spoke fluent and idiomatic English and was quite humorous. I was deeply impressed by her meticulous attentions to details and timing. A camera crew was there shooting some documentaries that day, which added a surprise to this unique experience. Yuka lead us through noisy game studios and quiet residential quarters to experience brielfly the diverse Tokyo life before seeing everyone of us off.For dipping into real Japanese cuisinal culture and serving Japanese food yourselves, this is the top choice in Tokyo."

The first great thing about the course is that it was at her home making it personal. There was only the 4 of us and 1 other so we had plenty of time to chat to Yuka and ask questions about the food. We chose the Gyoza and wagyu beef course which was delicious! Another bonus about it being in Yuka's house was that she could talk us through everything as if we were at home and the ingredients were in the fridge.

I only gave this 3 stars for 2 important reasons: There were 9 students in this class (10 at the table when you add Yuka). It was just too crowded for her small apartment. My other piece of feedback is that we made several courses (all very tasty), but we waited until the very end to eat everything. It would have been really nice to eat as dishes as they were finished--as the class went from 10am to 2pm (right over the lunch hour). I was famished by the time we ate."

She was very informative about life in Tokyo and what we should see/do while we were in town - we took a lot of her advice and had a great time. The amount of food was substantial - it was like a Japanese Thanksgiving! We left totally stuffed! We would highly recommend this to anyone interested in sushi or learning how to make it."

Yuka is quite particular about ingredients and method, and this should appeal to both hobbyists and even experienced cooks. Fun class!"

Yuka was patient and showed us how to cut meat na omelette and other ingredients and then we prepared everything and of course ate it.Our group was only 5 people and that was also what I liked a lot compare to bigger cooking classes.I definitely reccommend you to choose Yuka as your japanese food cooking teacher."

It was a small intimate setting, which was very nice after the bustle of the city. I am so glad I didn't end up in a class with 20 people -- the 6 of us got to try all different techniques. I learned a lot! I also really appreciated that Yuka used really high quality ingredients and she shared a lot of information about how to buy the ingredients-- both in Japan and in the US (where she has spent some time). Her english is also great, which made understanding the directions fairly easy. I also really appreciated that she met us at the train station and walked us back - it would have been hard to find her place on my own. I highly recommend this class - it was a lot of fun!"

It was very hands on and Yuka made us welcome in her home and gave us the recipes to take home. It was a great day and Yuka even took us on a supermarket tour at the end and we learned about other Japanese ingredients and how they are used in cooking. She was a lovely teacher. Highly recommended!"

Thank you very much Yuka for the great time, advise and mouthwatering sushi!What is better at Yuka's cooking class compared to others:> price or value for money!> small groups - we were five - in the kitchen is space for a maximum of 8 Persons so it is garantueed that you are not more than 8 (most of the time less people!) > you do EVERYTHING > starting with WASHING the rice! You learn to prepare the sushi from the first step, so you will be able to do exactly the same thing later at home> you get the recipes printed out with all information (so during the course you can pay attention without the need to write everything down)> Yuka is a very clean person - she will make sure EVERYONE's hands are washed and desinfected before starting!> a lot of extra information - during cooking there is a lot of time to chat with Yuka about Japan, Japanese people, japanese food ...> after the course Yuka accompanied us to a supermarket and showed us where to get all ingredients and what to consider during the shopping! Moreover she showed us around the area > contacting, booking, getting there > all very easy!!> and and and The class was totally worth the money (8000Y). (I know that sushi classes in Germany cost even more - but they do not take part in Tokyo - the Sushi-mekka, they don't come with a lot of extra information, the fish is less fresh,...)Thank you again Yuka - I will definetely recommend the Sushi class and your other cooking classes to my friends!"

I will have to stay there were mostly great things about this class, and only a few \"need to improve\" things. Let's start off with the great:Yuka was such a wonderful host! She was polite, punctual and extremely informative.Yuka picked us up from the Hiro-o station and we walked to her home, it was nice to chat with her about the surrounding area, and learn a bit more about Japan along the way.The sushi we made was way better than our hotel sushi (but I'm sure most places would have been better than our hotel) Her home was very nice, and relaxing. She made us feel welcome and part of the family. Her instructions (while a bit rushed), were clear and she helped everyone cut the sushi properly, and went over every little step of the process.She went out of her way to make sure we had the best ingredients! The money paid for the class went a long way, and I was glad to see this!Now, for the \"needs improving\":While her class doesn't really have many negatives about it, there were just a few things that I would recommend improvements upon.Don't leave tasks unsupervised! The poor gentleman from Milan, Italy was left to monitor the miso broth, and ended up throwing away the broth due to a misunderstanding of instructions. Try to be a bit patient with everyone. I do understand there is a lot of information to be covered in a short amount of time, but I felt as if we were rushed to do things on our own after just a couple of steps. This left most everyone around the table confused, and asking each other for help. Overall, I will take her cooking class again for different options. I was highly impressed with her professionalism and courtesy to everyone. The company was wonderful, and I left feeling full, happy, and satisfied.A+"

We enjoyed from the get-go, in fact, the details of making sushi are so mind-boggling that it made us appreciate it even more. The best part about this was making it, eating it and learning about many other aspects of Japanese culture including how to use wasabi. You will never learn these anywhere else so candidly. We were also taken on a tour through the neighborhood and supermarket later to see what goes into buying the right ingredients. If you have 3-4 hours to spare, this is a must-do activity and with Mazda-san, you will never regret it! Thank you Mazda-san!"

I don't care for the miso paste served in most restaurants in the US. I must say this was amazing. Susie making was fun - but not as fun as eating our delights.

But that was just the beginning as Yuka brought us along the interesting paths of Japanese culture and its delicate and tasty cuisine.During the class the atmosphere was relaxed and funny so that the only hint of the passing of time was given by my stomach asking to try the wonderful food that we were preparing.In fact, thanks to Yuka`s suggestions, regardless of your level of experience, at the end of the day you will enjoy a juicy, tasty meal prepared by yourself!And that is just the beginning as I can now start to try the generous amount of recipes that Yuka taught me in my own house at any time.To resume, if you are in Tokyo and feel like spending a day in a warm atmosphere, with great, funny and competent company, cooking and eating wonderful traditional Japanese food and with every detail gently taken care for you, then Yuka is really what you are looking for: Absolutely suggested."

She was on time at our Meeting Point and walked to her home with us. Beside me and my friend only one other couple joined us. So we were a really small group. At home, Yuka's kitchen was already prepared. She has bought only the best ingredients and everything what you need for really good Sushi. And be warned, don't eat, before you visit the cooking school. You will really make a lot of Sushi!During our preparations, Yuka explained and showed us every step. With her explanations Sushi making was really easy. But that is no wonder, because, Yuka herself is a very popular cookery book author in Japan. Yuka also explained a lot about general Japanese cooking and Japanese living. And if you need some more sightseeing tips, she will be happy to assist you. She recommended a lot of restaurants to us, which we should visit when we are in Kyoto (our next place during our Japan trip). And the restaurants she recommended have been worth a visit!After everything was prepared, we started to eat. Additionally to the Sushi, we prepared a really tasty Miso soup. As a surprise Yuka had already made a dessert for us the day before. So that our Sushi cooking class was in fact a full 3 course meal with one cup of traditional matcha tea at the end.And to top it all, everyone even got a present at the end. Yuka, I can only say: thank you! It was a great experience, which I can only recommend to everyone!"

We were fortunate to be able to book an evening class with Yuka on New Year's Eve, a special time in Japan and the last night of a memorable family trip. We went on the strength of her reviews here and it was absolutely better than we had even expected. Yuka is the real deal - she has written numerous cookbooks, has a vibrant online presence, teaches cooking extensively to the Japanese and thanks to her training in Europe, she has the communication skills, humor and ability to bring Japanese cooking alive to people who want to learn. We were humbled by the things that we did not know and the craft of Japanese cooking, but also by its simplicity. Yuka-san demystifies the techniques needed, but also give hints to the deeper understanding and skills associated with everything from making sushi rolls to preparing rice, to handling Kobe beef. We could not have asked for a better way to wrap up our trip, particularly as we followed her advice and went right after our class to the Meji shrine at midnight. Thank you, Yuka, for lasting lessons in cooking, and for special memories of Japan."

However, Yuca's sushi making class was awesome and so much fun! To begin with,Yuca met us at the train station nearby her house, for that reason it was very easy to meet her as the train lines in Tokyo are very easy to understand. She is a very sweet and funny lady, and her teaching skills and techniques were pretty impressive. Her English is also very good and clear, so you won't have a problem understanding the steps. She is very detailed and make sure everyone understands the steps without getting bored. I was amazed by what I learned and already practiced some of the recipes at home, back in the U.S., and it came out exactly like the one we made at the class because she also sends you with the recipes you learned during class. I will definitely come back for another class next time I'm in Tokyo! Maybe the Tempura class next :). Also, make sure you don't eat too much prior to the class as we had so much food that we couldn't even finish it. I would recommend this class to anyone, even if you are not a fan of cooking, Yuca was so welcoming and wonderful that she will make anything interesting."

Yuka took her time To explain us all the different ingredients, where she got them from And which one have the highest quality. She used only the best of tuna, salmon and scallops . In addition to this she had a big variety of different veggies and herbs. Her English was excellent which made it quite easy to follow her instructions which made us create the most beautiful and delicious sushis.

She was quick to add expert tips on the brands to buy (that would create the difference in taste), what to look out for in the cooking process before the next step etc. These were the added special touches that one won't get from recipe books.

The class was good value (I paid 80,000 JPY for each person and took at least 3 hours but it would have been longer if I didn't have to leave early). She also even offered to take us to the grocery store after class! She was very knowledgeable (having studied and traveled all over the world), adorable, but most of all kind. I was ill during the class and unfortunately had to cut the class short. I was so disappointed but Yuka wrapped all the food up in individual wraps, gave me soy sauce, chop sticks, added freezer packs and put it in a portable cooler just to make sure the fish would be the perfect temperature when I got back to my place to enjoy later! She offered me her help in case I needed to see a doctor or pick up medicine at the store (since I would be lost in a pharmacy in Japan). She truly felt like a friend or family member. It's so rare you find someone like that, especially in a time of need when you're away from home. Thank you Yuka. Hope to see you sometime again."

With a broad culinary knowledge base covering a variety of different continents Yuka is clearly very into her food and judging by her TV shows on Youtube and numerous published recipes, also extremely talented. The class I took was the 8000 Yen Sushi course, covering nigiri, sushi rolls, sashimi, making of the miso soup from broth, dipping sauce for chilled Tofu as well as sake and a Tea ceremony at the end to finish the day off. Given the quality of the ingredients alone the course is extremely good value (some of the best quality fresh fish I had while in Japan), while Yuka very generously at the end of the class provided me with the required sushi equipment that would be difficult to source back home. Throughout the class Yuka shared useful and insightful knowledge on both the food we were preparing, and wider Japanese culture, while instructions were clear and concise (also printed recipes given for the day), ensuring I was able to keep up with everything that was being said, as well as lots of encouragement given as I navigated the slightly tricky part of rolling the sushi in line with her restaurant quality standards! A lot of preparation had clearly gone in from her side (all ingredients had been pre measured for instance), making sure the day's learning was maximised, while she was also extremely generous in allowing the lesson to overrun by a few hours as I tried to get as much as possible out of the experience. I couldn't recommend the day more highly, and have come away with this being the highlight of a fabulous trip to Japan."

Yuka, a Tokyo chef, invited us into her home to teach us about Japanese cooking as well as about the inside look into life as a local. She is a chef with her own cookbook and makes tv appearances, given that we were taught how to cook from a true chef was an amazing experience. She also explained to us the importance of fish selection, the customs of Japanese eating and about how people in japan live. We made all different types ofsushi and miso soup based on clams. Being a chef she bought only highest grade fish and products , and we got to use her high quality cooking utensils which I must admit, was fun. After we completed our cooking, we sat down to enjoy our final product together.This was when the evening went from great to amazing. She treated us like we were family , started opening her cupboards and bringing out sake for us to taste, then after that was done, we shared some asahi beer.We spent the evening talking like old friends. Afterwards, she walked us to the local supermarket, showed us the different Japanese products and explained a few to us, and showed me which matcha tea she made me in her home so I could buy it to bring back to canada.She walked us to our subway station , hugged us and waited (like my parents and family always do) until we boarded our train and waved and waved to us. She asked us to reach out to her and come back to japan. Such a GENUINE and kind person, I was very impressed with her not only the cooking class but moreso, with her as a person. Thank you , Yuka,For one of the best experiences I've made during travelling. Hugs,From Toronto:)"

She started the class off by giving us each detailed copies of the recipes, and then going over the ingredients we were to use, which were all top quality. This was followed by a hands-on lesson -- Yuka would give a demo of key steps, pointing out best practices as well as bad habits to avoid, and then let us students loose in her kitchen. The class size was small (only 3 people) which meant that we each received focused attention from Yuka. Following the class, she took us around Hiroo, including a tour of the supermarket. Whether you're an expat living in Tokyo or a tourist just passing by, I highly recommend setting aside some of your time for Yuka's sushi course."

Yuka was kind enough to accept only 4 of us as I requested. When we entered her apartment there was a small but gorgeous looking chocolate cake waiting for our friends to congratulate their wedding. It was a really really sweat gesture. Although all of us have been living in Japan quite a while neither of us knew anything about japanese kitchen or how to make sushi. Yuka started from very basic (but most important) like how to make a good rice..etc. Few things I really like about the class was;1) Yuka absolutely bought the top quality ingredients. I can say that because I live in here. there was only best tuna, best salmon, best avacado..etc on the table2) We actually did everything. Yuka just showed us one sample and the rest was ours. It was not a just listen and watch class.3) All the ingredients on the table has been used. It was way too much food. In the end of the class, we were quite tipsy, proud with our amazing looking sushis and so full from eating them. Cant wait to host sushi parties at home now! It is highly recomended"

I did the sushi rolls course, and yuka was very careful to check which ingredients i could eat (i have a shellfish allergy) and happy to make substitutions. She also picks you up from and returns you to the station, so you won't get lost. The class lasted 3 hours, and you can learn lots of different techniques in that time. Yuka also gave me the tools and some ingredients so that i could try the dishes again by myself. I highly recommend this class!u"

A personal experience by Yuka is the \" breath of fresh air\". Right from the immediate response to my email enquiry, and the personal meeting at the subway station, I felt this was going to be a great experience. After meeting we walked to Yuka' s house through her local neighbourhood! So different looking at the sights through a \"locals\" eyes. We took the sushi class. It's all about the \" little things\". The attention to detail, the smallest mistake, can determine the wrong outcome. Yuka highlighted the importance of such details to make the perfect sushi. I was so amazed that once we had completed the sushi class, that the platter in front of us, had been made by us. The class included the delicate art of making dashi, the beautiful refined dish of silken tofu, lots of questions answered about ettiquette, and fantastic restaurant recommendations for the duration of our stay. Thankfully we visited Yuka on our second day, so had a long list of restaurants to try.After the class we went to the local market to swoon over Japanese product, and amazed by the diverse array on offer! ( it makes shopping in Australia seem somewhat dull) . I now know the obsession the Japanese have with food. In Yuka's words, \"the Japanese are crazy for food\". Of course most travellers to Tokyo take in the famous sights of the palace, the temples, and the beautiful Edo culture. If you want a personal experience into \" real\" tokyo, this is it! Not to mention how amazed you will be at how well you can cook!( with Yuka's help) did I mention you get to eat all you make!! Do not eat before you go!!!!! I can't thank Yuka enough! I'm writing this review the following day because I'm so excited about the restaurant recommendations I will try for the next 5 days. Arigato!!!! A small insight by a foreigner into a fascinating foreign land.It's more than a cooking class, but Yuka sharing her Tokyo with us!!!!LUCKY US!!!!!"

When you out there backpack by yourself, one of things on my checking list--ensure I can really get to know food and culture. Taking Yuka San's cooking class is one of random things I had done over Japan a month ago. First, Yuka San is very conscious of what cooking materials she offered, such as: producer brand, producer location, and how the cooking material produce. To her, everything she teaches her students to cook has to right. Second, the health and nutrient aspects of material has to be calculated properly. As we cooked, she made sure me drained out all the grease, and we really did not see that everywhere I took the cooking CLASSES. Third, the presentation of how to serving the food is one of most essential part that she shared. I was blessed enough to be the only student for the entire day. she shared with me everything she can in that short period of time from food, local life to social life in Japan. It was definitely worth visit and great investment on the day. I miss the time spending with her. thanks Yuka San."

She was well organized and got us going on our respective tasks. It was so much fun! Our daughter does not care to eat seafood, so she prepared some vegetable rolls for herself. We also learned to make a wonderful tofu dish as well as a delicious soup. All the ingredients for the class were of high quality. We finished with tea and a sweet, then were presented with some thoughtful gifts. Yuka then walked us back toward the train station, stopping for a tour of a very nice grocery store. We thanked Yuka for a wonderful afternoon and decided to explore the area before getting on the train. After visiting a couple shops to our surprise we heard Yuka calling after us. With our enthusiasm with the class, we had forgotten to get information from Yuka on an unrelated matter. She actually waited there to find us to give us the information then offered to show us around for the rest of the afternoon. She could not have been nicer or more accommodating. We graciously explained that we had other plans, but we were so touched by how friendly she is. Yuka also e-mailed us the names and locations for a few of her favorite restaurants. We highly recommend taking a cooking class with Yuka Mazda."

Yuka is a friendly person that knows when to help students and when to let them work for themselves so they learn the most. I definitely recommend this cooking class and Yuka's friendly demeanor!"

Mari made us feel so welcome in her home and the whole experience felt so personal compared to doing this with a big group. It was so lovely being taught how to make traditional Japanese food and now that I have the recipe I will definitely be making it again. All of the food we made was delicious. Mari even taught us how to serve Japanese food and plate it correctly. I enjoyed learning about Japanese cuisines and traditional cooking methods. Mari ended the cooking class with a beautiful dessert she had made and even gave us all a little gift to take home. So glad we did this cooking class. It was a lovely experience and very rewarding."

She offered us tea and explained about the ingredients that go into a typical Japanese meal. Each person was given one or more tasks to help prepare the meal. My task was cutting onions which I did badly, as in Japanese cooking onions have to cut really thinly.After some hard work mixed with general conversation we sat down to taste the food. I can honestly say, it was one of the best meals I have ever tasted. We even had a desert made from coconut and banana which Mari prepared plus some Chocolates from Papua New Guinea which I provided. These proved to be quite popular with the group.This was my first day in Japan and a really enjoyable experience. Mari is a great cook, a kind host with a lively personality."

Mari's class was very well reviewed and her website was easy to access and use for English speakers. I emailed her ahead of time and luckily she had an opening for us. The class itself was very informative and fun. There were 6 of us in the class from all over the world: Hawaii, California, Germany, Australia, a good mix of students. We did a lot of the food preparation and Mari helped us while cooking the dishes. We made several different dishes: a salad with homemade dressing, soup stock, a marinated pan-fried fish main dish. Mari also made a fancy dessert for us at the end.Mari is knowledgeable and she includes many key details as to why the Japanese cook the way they do. She has a lot of info on what types of ingredients and where to get them. She even assisted one of the students locating a knife shop to pick up a Japanese-made chef's knife. Her English is very good, did not have any trouble communicating at all. All in all, it was a very good experience and well worth it. Highly recommend the experience."

Mari is incredibly friendly and outgoing with grade A English and a great sense of humor. She is also a top notch chef, with years of experience, formal training in cooking around the world, and a recently published popular cookbook (yet you'll never hear about it from her). The food we cooked under her direction was one of the best meals we had in our month long stay. Don\u2019t let that scare you - her class is incredibly and approachable for beginners and advanced amateurs a like. Her explanations are very clear and thorough, with plenty of room for questions. She gives ample background information about the dish\u2019s history and role in Japanese cuisine. She spends time discussing the technique and the different cooking utensils we will use. At least two talks (before and after the cooking) were spent going over the various ingredients: where do they come from, what is their function in the dish, how to choose them, and of course - how to substitute those hard to find outside of Japan. The class format was a group of 6 people. We started with a short introduction. Mari went over the dishes we will cook, when (and how) are the dishes served, and then gave out tasks for different prep work and cooking. We had two main dishes and several side dishes, so each person had several things to do, and participated in nearly all dishes (which is something that does not happen in some cooking classes we read about on TripAdvisor). We had a great group with plenty of stuff to chat about, and made sure to swap tasks between us, so everyone could take part in all the dishes. Mari went from person to person, giving pointers and correcting technique, making sure to call other group members to pay attention for important tips. Obviously, Mari printed the full recipes for us, with plenty of space to scribble additional remarks. We set up the table and talked some more over the incredible meal we cooked. We had a blast talking to the other participants and Mari herself. We talked about cooking, about travel and about Japan. In many ways, this class was a cultural experience as well as a foodie one. After another round of questions and answers about what we had just made, Mari served a surprise French dessert, which was amazing, and gave out packages with more stuff to take home. This was a great way to end our trip, and we are eager to invite our friends for a Japanese meal, to flaunt our newly acquired skills and ingredients."

Mari's apartment is located to Tsukiji Fish Market (which is also a must-do), so I visited the market in the morning, and had a sushi breakfast there. Afterwards, I walked to the station where we're supposed to meet (about 1 mile/1.6km away). There, I met with Mari and the rest of the class. In my class of 6, 2 had taken the class before, and are taking it again on their next visit to Tokyo. From this, I was sure that the class was going to be a memorable experience. Mari was the sweetest lady ever, and the class was absolutely fantastic. She invited us into her home, and had all the ingredients laid out and ready to be prepared. I've never really had experience cooking before, but I was still able to contribute and help make the course. After cooking all the food, we sat down and all ate together. It was delicious! I'll have to try to replicate this meal in the future. If you're looking for great conversation, a lesson with real, traditional Japanese home style cooking, Mari's class is the place to go. I loved it!"

Taking this class gave us insights not only into how to cook Japanese food but Japanese culture and daily life in Tokyo. First, we learned how to make the essential basis of much of Japanese soups and sauces, dash broth, and then moved out to a whole Japanese meal. We loved this class, and Mari made every minute count!

When it came to the cooking, we all took turns on different jobs and then she ran through how to bring it all together. And the food was AMAZING!!! I don't know if I'll remember how to make it again even with the recipe, but it was very delicious. She even gave us a little bonus dessert afterwards and we sat around chatting for 30-40 minutes after we finished eating. All in all, a great day!"

We ended the meal with a lovely dessert which Mari had prepared earlier and I left with a full stomach, a lovely memory, a nice souvenir and her newly published cookbook.

I was immediately sold.I emailed Mari right away to inquire. She got back to me very quickly and I signed up. The payment process was easy and secure and before I knew it we were on our way to Japan. The class took place in Mari\u2019s own home - something that I thought was very kind of her to do AND it offered a peek into a Japanese kitchen. The class was small, with just 6 people, so it was an intimate setting and everyone was able to help out with the cooking process. The class itself was about 3-4 hours long and we were able to eat a full meal that we prepared ourselves! Mari then provided dessert that she had previously made. It was delicious!We learned so much about Japanese cooking styles, techniques and history. We used new ingredients, new cooking tools and culinary traditions. Mari even let us try her very own miso that she makes every year. I had no idea how to make miso, but now I do!Mari also recently published a cookbook.

            "review": "English-language Japanese cooking class in Tokyo - a must-have experience for any home cook who likes Japanese food. Mari's class was not only fun but immensely practical. It turns out Japanese cooking is perfect for the home cook: once you know foundations (dashi, rice, rice vinegar, a little sugar, mirin, soy sauce, miso, seasonal vegetables), how they are used and what techniques are applied, you can easily make soup, day pickles, and everything else. Mari demonstrated this both in her menu and in her execution. The class was well organized and fun. Nothing was technically too difficult and everyone seemed to be learning from what everyone was doing (we read the recipes together, then split into teams to make everything). Mari is thoughtful and welcoming of questions on any subject at all (especially related to food and Japanese and international cuisine), clearly well informed and with a perspective of her own to bring to the conversation. And I didn't leave hungry (I bet no one did).My spouse and I sometimes attempt to cook \"Japanese\" at home, although with mixed results until now. We'll be applying what we learned in Mari's class to bento (lunch boxes), weeknight suppers, and parties. The recipes are a bonus.Note: the class covers the basics. If you are already accomplished in Japanese cuisine, you may learn a little less. You should still have fun though.More free advice: the Tokyo subway is very reliable and the trains are very frequent. Do not plan extra time for travel to the meeting place, unless you have already scoped out a cafe or somewhere to cool your heels.Final note: In Japan, the custom is *do not tip*, but you can expect to witness a free exchange of omiyage (little presents) between guests and hostess. You will be happiest if you know this ahead of time and prepare yourself accordingly."

Mari just published a cooking book. We all grabbed one for future home entertaining ideas.3. In hindsight, I wish I took her class prior exploring Tokyo.

Always travelling for work in Tokyo/Japan, and for this visit, I have decided to return to Tokyo for leisure and to explore my passion - food and paragliding in Japan. I found Mari on FaceBook and web blog. Great comments about her skills and hospitality. Mari-san gave a good inside about Japanese ingredients, great step by step details on Japanese cooking and \"hands-on\" experience cooking. I had a great time cooking and food were delicious. Thank you Mari-san. Hope to see you soon again when I return to Tokyo."

She gave us tea and a recipe packet, went over the prep stations, and had us get to work. There was a lot of hands on and not just us watching her cook. We made sushi, miso soup, and an eggplant and peppers side dish. She went over traditional Japanese cuisine, the different types of kelp/miso, and the food culture in Japan. There was a newspaper crew taking lots and lots of photos, but it was only a minimal distraction. Next time I'm in Tokyo I will definitely book another class with Mari. Definitely schedule in advance as I was lucky to get the last spot in the class."

My partner and I were lucky enough to book ourselves in for a traditional Japanese sweets class with Mari at quite late notice - but I would recommend booking in advance to make sure you don't miss out! We were welcomed into her kitchen along with four other travelers who seemed to enjoy the experience just as much as we did. Mari has a wonderful, clear way of communicating her vast knowledge about Japanese ingredients and cooking. She took us carefully through the ingredients we would use (and the best places to purchase some raw materials to take home), then walked us through the process, encouraging each of us to participate in the cooking. Then, we got to eat it all - delicious! The written recipes she provided were great (and complete), but I also took lots of notes to try to take home as much of her knowledge as possible. She suggested some really helpful variations and tips to get the most out of the recipes. We will definitely be contacting Mari again next time we are in Tokyo."

She welcomed us into her compact apartment, where our party of four joined two Japanese ladies for a lesson on the Japanese cooking and ingredients. Then she set us to the task of making lunch and setting a Japanese table. While we dined on our delicious meal, she answered all variety of questions about everyday life in Tokyo. It was a wonderful experience and a unique opportunity to interact personnally in a huge impersonal city."

What we got was more than just follow this recipe and cook this meal. Mari sat down with the whole group (there were 6) and went over the different kinds of kelp, bonito flakes, and miso paste available and how to go about buying it. Mari had a lot of these different products in her house and we were able to see the different kinds of kelp as well as see and smell the different miso pastes. These products were the basis of our meal so it was nice to see the variations. The rest of the class went well as we divided up the cooking responsibilities among the group and eventually sat down to a delicious dinner. Mari showed us the proper way to set a Japanese table and we all took turns asking etiquette questions as well as general questions about Japan and the culture. We made Sakana no Nanban-duke (marinated seafood dish), Nasuno Hukumeni (boiled eggplant), with miso soup and rice. I would recommend cooking with Mari to those skilled and unskilled in the kitchen. A fabulous experience!"

She has the cutest little dog!!!"

We had planned to go to Ginza and Tsukiji in the next days. All I can say is wow.Mari met us at the met station and was amazingly hospitable from the start. Amazing spoken english also. We met up with another couple from New Zealand who were really pleasant also and went to her apartment.While a simple menu ( Because none of us knew where to start ) She was extremely attentive to detail and helped us create wonderful food. Would recommend for anyone travelling the main part of Tokyo.Kanpai!"

I actually attended two classes with Mari on the same day- one in the morning to learn to make tonkatsu, goma-ae and miso soup, and one in the afternoon to learn to bake. The class sizes were great and allowed for a lot of interaction with Mari for us to ask questions. While we were there she taught us about the different ingredients and how they came together to make the final product. In the break between classes she gave me directions to get down to the Tsukiji area so I could walk around and grab some ingredients. Overall, great class, great instructor and great atmosphere. I highly recommend it!"

We were made to feel very welcome by Mari who is brimming with knowledge about Japanese food and able to answer any question. She also gave us an interesting insight into cultural and social norms in Japan as we chatted over lunch.We just wished we could have had more say in the menu, as the beef stew we created was lovely but very similar to what we would make at home. Unfortunately this was selected by other guests who didn't turn up! Perhaps some sort of voting system could be introduced? Or after booking each guest / couple could chose from a two or three options? Thank you Mari!"

When we booked this cooking class from Australia, we wondered just how it would go! Mari was very communicative via email and was able to answer my questions and guide us in the choice of menu that would suit us.

Mari was very enthusiastic and friendly as she explained to us very comprehensively the background to the cooking ingredients and method for cooking. We all joined in preparing the meal as Mari showed how to deal with the ingredients. No real cooking knowledge is required and it was fun to use ingredients that were mostly unfamiliar to us.This background to Japanese cooking helped us throughout our stay in Tokyo because we could understand how some of the dishes were prepared and their ingredients.

Cooking with Mari was one of the highlights of my trip to Japan!I enjoy Japanese desserts and Mari helped demystify the process by explaining the ingredients (and acceptable substitutes ). I bake a lot, but she thought me a few new tricks and inspired me to get a cooking scale. Since our group was small, we were sent home with leftovers to share with our friends. There are a few english speaking Japanese cooking classes in Tokyo, but this was the only one I found where you could learn in someone's home. I enjoyed talking to Mari and the rest of our class about Japanese culture. Mari also talked me out of going to Jiro's sushi restaurant - apparently it is the only 3 Michelin star restaurant without a bathroom and the meal lasts 15 minutes???"

It was easy to organise per email before we went to Japan. She explained were to meet and all went very smooth. Mari does the cooking class at their home and we apprechiated to have the class in a private home. She explained the dishes and ingredient with much detail, then we cooked together the meal that tasted great. We learnt a little bit more about the Japanese culture and I would recommend Mari's cooking class. It is not cheap, but she uses quality ingredients and shared her passion for them with us."

She not only shows us how to cook AUTHENTIC Japanese food, she explains the different types of foods/vegetables/seasonings for the different regions of Japan. She also helps explain WHY things are done a certain way AND how to avoid common mistakes that affect the flavor and texture of the dish. She was VERY patient and even tolerated our hijacking of the conversation from time to time. (Sorry) We were in Japan for 11 days and SERIOUSLY considered seeing if we could squeeze in a second class. Now I'm very eager to get back home to see if I can find some equivalants or options so I can make something similar back home. I also intend to see if I can schedule a LUNCH class with her on a future visit!! We did our class with 5 from our party. 3 adults and 2 teenagers. ALL enjoyed the experience! I felt like when we were done, not only had a learned a lot, I had made a friend in Japan! Thank you Mari (and husband) for sharing your home with us!"

The first people to book the date get to make the menu you will be cooking, so I recommend you book early to insure you can plan something you want to learn how to cook. We did an evening class and cooked miso soup, potato cakes and dumplings. Although it wasn't our menu, it was very good and we enjoyed making and eating it. Mari took the time to explain different options for changing ingredients in the dishes to suit various tastes. We also got to meet some interesting tourists like ourselves.It was a fun time and one of the highlights of our snow filled visit to Tokyo!"

Mari hosts a Japanese cooking session that is, if one were to judge by the booking rate, highly popular. You will spend about three hours in her apartment with a few other eager students of Japanese cooking learning how to prepare for and cook one type of Japanese dish with some side dishes. The location is very easy to get to, as she lives directly next to a subway station (and will happily meet you there to guide you to her apartment for the class). She offers a listing of things she has covered in the past on her website (http://www.japanese-cooking-class-tokyo-mari.com/). The price point is exactly spot on, considering that it includes the meal that is prepared, and the amount of time that you receive instruction. You are able to walk away with a recipe in English for all the items that were prepared, along with any notes you chose to make during the session. She also welcomes photography at any point during the class. Mari is native Japanese, but owing to time spent in the US, is able to flawlessly offer all instruction in English. Another enjoyable aspect was the interaction with fellow students throughout and after the class. As my schedule allows, I will continue to utilize her services to explore the Japanese culture on a deeper level, as well as squeezing in some practice in speaking some Japanese. The environment caters well to the solo adventurer, the couple looking for something interesting to do, or the family looking to bond together. Two thumbs up!"

The class was at her flat near Tsukiji market and there were 6 of us attending.We made sushi rolls, miso soup and spinach shiroi. Mari spent lots of time explaining the different ingredients, e.g. the different types of miso, and gave us tips where to get them at the market. She was very knowledgeable and good at explaining everything.We were cooking at her home so it is also a chance for people to see a typical Japanese flat. But that also means that there isn't lots of space and we shared out the tasks. So for the Spinach shiroi, for example, one person ground the sesame, one person mashed the tofu, etc. and then we had one shared disk rather than everyone making their own version.I love cooking and learned a lot, I can really recommend it for anyone wanting to understand the subtlety of Japanese cooking a little more! It's probably not something for small kids or people who aren't very interested in cooking."

Double the delights in Tokyo and learn the secrets of Japanese home-cooking with Mari. A passionate cook, Mari speaks fluent English and loves to give tourists and visiting foreigners a hands-on opportunity to cook, check out ingredients, taste their handiwork and share tips on what\u2019s good to eat and do in Tokyo and Japan.I found Mari\u2019s class after I googled English-language classes in Japanese cooking. And Mari readily answered my email. After exchanges about my dates and her classes she found a vacancy and I booked and paid online. She meets her guests/students at her local train station before we walk together the 30 or so meters to her apartment. Mari is a warm and relaxed host and teacher. My fellow students were a young Australian couple visiting Japan for the first time and a young French woman recently moved to Tokyo. All four companions for the day were interesting, enjoyed sharing travel stories and loved food. My kind of people!Our host turned out to be a gifted teacher and engaging young woman. Taught to cook originally by her mother and grandmothers she kept the flame alive doing cooking courses throughout her training and subsequent professional career. After spending a year overseas to learn English Mari returned to Tokyo and established her niche cookery school based in her home concentrating on home-style cooking and regional specialities in Japanese cuisine for tourists and overseas visitors.We prepared a home-cooked meal of Okonomiyaki (Japanese pancakes), Imo-mochi (potato cake) and a dashi stock that we then used to prepare the most delicious Miso soup. All the easy-to-follow recipes were provided. Under Mari\u2019s supervision and using her detailed notes we prepared the meal from scratch. Then we ate the delicious results together and Mari peppered the chatter with loads of information about Japanese ingredients and cooking methods and answered all our questions about the how and the why of food, cooking and dining in Japanese life.It was great fun, the best three and a half hours I spent in Tokyo and very reasonably priced."

I am a Hong Kong Chinese, your proverbial 'Wannabe Home Cook' with a mission to achieve 10 cooking experience around the world since retirement 5 years ago, starting with Le Cordon Bleu back in 2009. Japanese culinary discipline is high on my list and I was privileged to experience Mari Nameshida's Magic first hand, in November last year. Googling for cooking instructions in English landed me with Sensei's web site, as well as TripAdvisor's pages and the rest is history. I convinced her to take me on a 2-week Intensive Course ie 6 hours a day x 12 days to learn the rudiments of Japanese cuisine. I was elated when Sensei said 'yes' after reading my blog - http://tangcancook.blogspot.com - which reaffirms my interests and commitment. The course was a roaring success, exceeding my expectations across all fronts. From basic cooking methods, to Washoku, to regional cuisines, to Yoshoku, to Kaiseki ... Sensei was able to give me a grand tour of not just the 'how' in preparing Japanese food, but the 'why' from both the cultural and sub-cultural angles. Best yet was the 1-on-1 platform, just Sensei and myself, teaching and learning the best of Japanese comfort foods, in a well equipped kitchen at her home. One cannot get more homely and more genuine than that, and it was sheer magic. This unique experience, so different from the cooking schools I attended, has put me on a different plane as I continue my quest. How would I describe my sojourn : steep learning curve, accelerated appreciation of Japan as a nation and the Japanese as a people, helicopter view of Japanese cuisine, professionalism that matches any proper school, bestowed confidence to cook when I am back home in Hong Kong, with depth and breadth since. How would I describe Sensei : a true professional, a charming personality, a genuine people person, a global player with a strong sense of identity, an untiring teacher who engages her students but above all, a fun individual who one can spend hours and hours with. Whether you are single, or a couple, or a family, or like me a Wannabe I bet Sensie can, and will, custom-tailor a program to meet your specific needs. That much I can guarantee, why? It is because I was there, I have done that, and I have nothing but the best to say about the NAMESHIDA MAGIC!"

Although I have been living in Japan for many years, I don't really know how to cook Japanese dishes, so I decided to sign up for a class with Mari. We cooked a mackerel dish, miso soup and egg custard pudding. Mari explained us about the ingredients, different types of miso and kelp, seasonal veggies etc.I used to think that cooking Japanese dishes would be difficult, but all the recipes are hassle-free and easy to recreate with different ingredients. Mari is a great teacher. She is very patient, attentive, polite and always made sure we understood the cooking process and answered all our questions. We also met her husband and he was also very nice and welcoming. They are a great couple. Mari's class was a wonderful experience and I will definitely go back to learn more dishes."

It sounds so simple but in fact we learned, for example, that there are many types of rice and that the tools for making the rice are as crucial to the quality as the ingredients. As we ( there was also a family of 4 that joined us) worked together in her comfortable apartment close to the Tsikiji Fish Market, we were also exposed to the nuances of the culture reflected in its food. We very much enjoyed Mari's hospitality and her excellent instruction. Next time we visit we would love to have Mari take us on a tour of the Tsikiji Market to point out the varieties of rice, soy sauce, tools, and quality of fish we talked about it during the class."

We were in Tokyo for a mere 3 evenings and chose to have our last meal as a cooking class with Mari prior to our late night flight from Haneda back to the US. What a treat! Booking rather last minute, we were subject to prior choices from other guests in terms of meal choice, but for this evening we made: Chirashi Sushi, Miso Soup (including the stock) and Imo-Mochi (potato cakes). Food was delicious and the education was outstanding! Having grown up in Hawaii, I was well exposed to Japanese foods and such, but learning true technique was priceless. I realized after all these years of making miso soup that I had been doing in incorrectly. Mari showed us how to make the dashi broth from scratch and how to incorporate the miso properly as well as the numerous inclusions you can add to your soup to make it tailored to your flavor preferences and ingredient availability. Mari met us at the subway stop, which was quite literally 19 seconds to the door of her building. We were staying somewhat nearby at the Conrad and opted to walk to her place as we had time after our checkout at 4pm in advance of our 4:30pm meeting time. The class took a good 3-3 1/2 hours during which we conversed with Mari and our co-cookers and sipped on tea. Mari's home gives a glimpse into the authentic living quarters of day-to-day Tokyo citizens and seeing this is priceless. We did a similar experience in Shanghai and loved all aspects! The meal preparation was well-organized and Mari had all the ingredients for us to prep and cook. I was amazed at the Imo-mochi... super simple in context and very delicious! The chirashi was top-notch as was the tuna she provisioned for us... it was so silky yet firm and delicate in flavor. Amazing! Having been to the fish auctions earlier in the day, it brought about a sense of completion seeing the product at market and prepping it in a home. Mari was very graceful and welcoming and we learned about the culture of Japan, living in Tokyo and the nuances of the cuisine. I have it on my list to make homemade dashi and a proper, simple miso soup as winter nears in Southern California. Thank you for a great evening and forever memorable experience!"

She got back to me quickly and answered a few questions about payment (yen paid at the end of the class) and ingredients. She was very accommodating and selected dishes that didn't include shellfish since we had one person in our party that was allergic. The class size is small, six people max I think, so it was intimate and everyone could participate. We enjoyed the explanation about ingredients typically used in Japanese cooking. The class is in her apartment, which is nice like cooking with a friend. Her husband came home from work so we got to meet him too and share our meal together. They were both very friendly and spoke English very well. We learned about different miso pastes and seasonal ingredients for garnishes with your soup. Making the dashi (soup base made with seaweed and dried bonito flakes) is simple and I've used her recipe already to make miso soup at home. I've used the powder dashi in the past and the flavor difference is noticeable. Making your own dashi gives you a mild, yet smoky flavor. We had a potato cake side dish (a regional dish from her hometown and not normally served/seen in Tokyo...what a treat!) and simmered Japanese eggplant and chicken main dish. All the dishes were so delicious! Before leaving Japan, I picked up some of the soy sauce and seaweed she used from the basement food floor at Takashimaya and packed them in my suitcase."

There are a number of things that stand out about the class. First it's in Mari's home, so it has the atmosphere where you learning from a friend in her home. Second, Mari's focus is to teach meals that everyday Japanese cook in their home, something any student (who knows there way around a kitchen) would feel confidant in creating back home. Third, the small class size gives you plenty of opportunities to ask questions about what you are creating or general advice about Japanese cooking. Last, its a value, the class fee is very reasonable, especially for the whole experience. We highly recommend Mari's class. Next time we are in Japan, we plan to take her class again to learn something new."

For me it was a wonderful experience, and if you have to choose between this or a karaoke night: you won't get any closer to japanese lifestyle than during this cooking class. A final advice: take a cooking class before you plan to go to the Tsukiji market, so you'll know what to buy at the market :-)"

The set up was very thorough, and we all got a hand out with detailed descriptions of the dishes. We first introduced ourselves and got to know each other a bit before we started cooking. The actual cooking was fun and very interesting, with a lot of insider tips, as Mari used to cook together with her mom a lot and later took various classes by herself. I'm looking forward a lot now to putting into practice at home, what I've learnt during the class. I can strongly recommend Mari's classes, and will definitely join again next time I come to Tokyo."

Mari invites you into here apartment with a group of 6 in total.Mari takes you through some of the basics of japanese cooking and talks you through some of the principles. Everyone gets involved in the course and the preparation of the food then you huddle round Mari's stove and watch here work her magic. My wife and I were with two other couples we did not know and still had a great time. As we were first to book we were asked if we had a preference of what we wanted to cook but we asked Mari to chose and she did not disappoint.Can recommend highly enough."

Her English was so impressive it wasn't funny! The good we cooked were family recipes which made the experience all the more impressive and she took the time to explain how different prefectures cook with subtle differences. If you are a chef, the class probably won't amaze you but as someone who juts loves food I really enjoyed it. Her husband came home early and ate with us and together they really provided a great, warm and social experience. Se also shared tips on places to shop and things to do which as a tourists I would have otherwise missed."

I like oyakodon, so I requested to make that, and I know that my fianc\u00e9 like nasu (Japanese eggplant), so I asked her to suggest an eggplant dish.I chose to do the lunchtime lesson, so I met up with her at 9:30am. She lives really close to the station where you meet up with her. It's nice that Mari knows English because it is much easier to learn how to cook in a language that you understand. As she was teaching me, she explained about why we did things the way we did; it helps you understand more about why you are making it a certain way.We finished cooking faster than I expected, but the food tasted great! I don't cook too often, so I was surprised that I could make something that tasted like this. I would definitely recommend taking a lesson with Mari. This makes my trip to Japan this time a bit more unique, because how many people from overseas can say they learned how to cook a traditional Japanese dish while in Japan? =)"

While making this we learned how to make the cornerstone of japanese food; the \"dashi\" stock. Also used for the miso-soup.Learning all of this makes it easier to make all other kinds of dishes!I really had a great time learning from Mari. It's hard not to consider her more of a friend than just a teacher after experiencing her homecooking class.I'll be back next year Mari-san!"

I discovered Mari's Cooking Classes through tripadvisor and from my initial communication Mari was professional, warm and friendly in her approach. She provided me with information and took a genuine interest in what our objectives were to ensure we delivered a high quality authentic cooking experience (we have been delivering this program for many years with regular attendees and expectations are high - Mari's class did not disappoint - however, for our larger group the only thing I might of changed was the time, reduced slightly). As our numbers increased we outgrew Mari's home kitchen and she therefore sourced a professional cook kitchen for us to use - nothing seemed to be too much trouble for Mari - she clearly wanted to make our cooking class work!If you are looking for an introduction to Japanese cooking Mari is delightful and I'm confident you would not be disappointed.If I return to Tokyo on a non-work related trip i will be taking my partner to Mari's place for my second cooking class, with gyoza Japanese dumplings on the menu!"

Thanks to this, our menu (more delicious and satisfying than I could've ever imagined) consisted of some miso soup, spinach side dish, and a wonderful Hokkaido-style entree called Ikameshi which is squid stuffed with rice, mushrooms, and other veggies. This next part may gross some people out, but I loved having a chance to \"gut\" the squid. Mari made it look so easy, but I can attest that it is insanely difficult to do it cleanly and quickly. With some other tips and tricks she shared, this wonderful dish was soon prepared and I realized quickly how much more I prefer Japanese homestyle meals to ones you may find on the menu pages of a restaurant (michelin-starred or not). I adored Mari and appreciated how easy-going and direct she was with her instructions.

It was one of the highlights of our 3 months in Tokyo. Mari has a wonderful touch in working with children, and we all enjoyed sitting down to a meal together when we were finishing cooking. I highly recommend this class!"

Mari does an excellent job in explaining all the basics. No matter what dishes you choose to cook with her, you will walk out of her apartment with a very good idea of Japanese cooking in general. I used to quit right away when trying to follow some recipes from my Japanese cook book, now it seems very familiar and easy and I actually understand all the ingredients and how to use them. All thanks to Mari! What I also enjoyed is the insight in the Japanese culture - Mari very openly explained many aspects of it."

We were having some problems making train reservations and she was eager to help us. She also steered us in the direction of some great kitchen supply shopping!

Mari is an excellent traditional cook (her husband is very lucky) and broke all of the myths created by staying at Ryokans. The only Miso soup I liked while in Japan was Mari's - she will explain why!You will learn all about the little tricks required for the baseline recipes and be made to feel very welcome in her home. A very experienced cook who has a genuine interest in her craft and will teach you in an enjoyable way. Thoroughly recommended and beats classrom stuff anyday."

There were 4 of us at this lesson, and the other couple was also from the US and very nice. We reviewed the instructions with Mari, and then came the making process! We had a great time using our feet to make the udon and making a lovely cucumber side salad. Mari's English skills are quite good, and it was a great experience to remember Japan by. She is lovely, and emailed us a photo of us as well!"

We loved the Bento dishes we prepared and will soon cook them again at home.However, for us it was so much more than a cooking experience. We had a lively discussion and could ask Mari all kinds of questions about Japanese culture and practical issues in Tokyo. This was of great value for us since we didn't know any locals before meeting Mari. Moreover, it's admirable to see how she is living her dreams by doing what she loves to do.

Our class included a young woman from Australia whom we enjoyed meeting and shared our travel stories. Mari assisted us with some touring directions which led us to Tokyo's cookware alley in Asakusa where we bought gifts. We enjoyed getting off the street, seeing her new apartment, learning about her life and family, and eating a good home-cooked lunch. Compared to similar classes in other countries, the price is extremely reasonable."

One of our daughters is allergic to nuts and shellfish and Mari was very happy to accommodate this.Mari met us at the station at the pre-arranged time. It was a very short walk (about 1 min) from the station to her apartment. We made sushi and gyoza, both from scratch and they were both excellent and left us all feeling that we would be able to do these successfully when we got home. We arrived home a couple of days ago and one of our daughters has already made sushi for a dinner party and it was a huge success! We are going to cook both the gyozas and sushi for a dinner party next weekend.One of the great things about the class was the opportunity to talk to Mari and her husband about Japanese food and culture. We really appreciated their openness and honesty.During our emails prior to our trip to Japan, I had told Mari that our family was travelling to celebrate both my husband's and daughter's birthdays, so she prepared a birthday cake for them. They were really surprised and both very touched that she had gone to this much effort.Overall it was a very pleasureable experience which we would highly recommend. If we are ever lucky enough to go back to Tokyo, a cooking class with Mari will be one of the things that it is right up there on our must do list."

Plain and simple, a MUST-DO for anyone visiting Tokyo and wanting to learn Japanese cuisine, not to mention also meeting one of the sweetest people on the planet. Highly recommend!My wife and I took Mari's class on our first full day after arriving in Tokyo. Having planned a meal with her including okonomiyaki, sushi preparation and some side dishes she recommended, we couldn't wait to meet her and get started.Meeting us right at the subway stop near her home, we were like friends after the first five minutes. The environment is charming, setup is clean and offers a real glimpse into a real-life Tokyo home. She threw some aprons on us and after a short time, it felt like family just cooking up an evening meal together. We asked tons of questions (sorry again for so many Mari!), and she was so accommodating in every way to answer them. She asked many herself, and we even were able to give her a recipe from the States. :)Much like Japanese cooking itself, Mari's approach is simple -- she LOVES food and you can see / feel / taste it throughout your entire time with her. Getting to know her own personal story while learning these dishes she grew up with, it's a privilege that we were able to meet her. Inspiring to say the least!It's now been a week or so back home, and we have already conjured up our first attempts at dishes post-Mari, to which (I think) we've done her proud.We realize she'll always now be part of our cooking... truly unforgettable. Thank you Mari for such a wonderful experience!!"

Wow, what a fun, USEFUL, and unique way to spend an afternoon in Tokyo. If you are at all into home cooking and enjoy japanese cuisine, this is an invaluable opportunity you shouldn't pass up!With multiple sessions a day, Mari hosts cooking sessions right in her apartment to teach basic traditional japanese courses - lunch and dinner sessions and sushi making! we were sad the sushi class didn't fit into our schedule, but our lunch time visit to learn a few of the basics was not only enjoyable for the afternoon, but something I have taken back home to San Diego and continued to utilize. for 5,000 JPY a person, you get a intimate cooking lesson of multiple courses that includes all the needed ingredients and a full sit-down meal after preparation and cooking. For our meal we learned to cook steamed clams, a beef stew, dashi stock and miso soup. I have continued to prepare completely homemade dashi and miso soup on more than one occasion at home now with confidence. i never imagined preparing real japanese meals in my home for myself and others and i cannot thank Mari enough for her wonderful class!In additional to easily learning the basics of japanese cooking, its a great international experience with people from all over the world taking her class. During ours, we were participating with guests from Honk Kong and Sweden. It was lovely sitting and talking about our experiences in Japan and how all our countries differ. Mari speaks fluent english (she even lived in the bay area in the US for a some time), and her home is right next to a subway station that she with meet everyone at. She even gave me the heads up on the cooking supply district not too far away where I was about to get a lovely handmade japanese cooking knife with free engraving of my name in kanji and english. quite possibly the coolest item I took back home to the US and I owe it all to her.i even 'liked' her page on facebook and get to enjoy the daily photos of her classes - and it was exciting to post my first homemade miso soup success and get kudos from her :)If you are staying in Tokyo and have a free afternoon, this is a great and rewarding activity to consider.Thanks again Mari!"

It was a very good experience, and very good value.This was my first class with Mari, but I'm definitely going to take more, and I can highly recommend this class to anyone."

I like the way she gave us tips on how to cook Japanese food that you don\u2019t often see them mentioned in cookbooks. We had a good time in the class. Hopefully, we will learn how to prepare other meals in our next trip."

We got in touch with Mari via email. She replied straight away and was really flexible, adjusting the menu to our tastes and to our vegetarian needs. On the day of the cooking classes Mari and her husband Ryo collected us at the station and took us to their home. Mari is really friendly and sociable, easy to get along with and has good English. She is a great cook, her passion for food is obvious. Mari used seasonal ingredients and gave us handy tips on where to get the ingredients in Tokyo, as well as some useful tips on how to prepare Japanese food.We ate the food - which was really yummy - together with Mari and Ryo. It was interesting to talk about Japanese culture with them, for instance about kendo (Ryo\u2019s hobby). We got the recipes to take home and they even gave us some Japanese gifts. It was a great experience, one of the highlights of our stay in Tokyo and we recommend it to anyone who likes Japanese food and cooking."

After desperately searching tourist information places, we found Mari on a blog online. Emailed her and straight away she responded, trying her best to accommodate my vegetarian needs. We arrived at her specified train station where she met us straight away and took us to a very comfy and clean home.The food was spectacular, (I regularly make the recipes for my friends and they love them) Mari's husband was really kind towards my partner Richard and the night was like spending it with old friends.Thank you, we will be back!!!

I can thoroughly recommend Mari's cooking class to anyone wishing to have a unique experience of real Japan (away from the main tourist attractions), whilst learning about Japenese culture and cooking. In their own apartment, Mari showed me how to make a selection of most delicious healthy traditional Japenese dishes, which afterwards we sat down to eat with her husband. Mari goes out of her way to find out what each guest wishes to cook and eat, and it was a priviledge to spend time with her in her own home. Afterwards we went shopping nearby for traditional ingredients. It was all really superb and a highlight of my holiday too!"

MAKE FRIENDSalthough i didnt bring any friends of mine, i never felt im was alone. there are 3 foreiners and two japanese besides me in the tour. while making sushi, we kept talking about our own counties and sharing funny and crazy experiences together. its a must to cooperate each other to make the best sushi, which makes the atmosphere so gooood!!3. JEEL JAPANESE ATMOSPHEREwe had a lesson at the place where japanese live in a daily life. its a good oppotunity to see the japanese life. and making sushi, taking about japan such as a manner, language, history, etc. dont worry even if you come to japan for the first time and dont know anything. after this tour, you would be addicted to japan:pthis tour is highly recommended if you want to put yourseld into japanese environment."

The class was much more than a cooking class; we also did some sushi trivia, Japanese culture/manners, and the history of sushi. I had no idea it was not originally Japanese but actually from SE Asia!The actual process of making the sushi is probably the easiest cooking thing I have ever done, so if you have no cooking experience don't let that stop you from taking this sushi making tour. Of course to be a master of sushi is not easy, but if you want to know enough to go into a grocery store and start making your own, well now I can! The hardest part is probably not making it but ensuring you have high quality ingredients.We made 4 kinds of sushi, including a decorative roll, which I've never seen before, it looks like a stick of dynamite; sushi wrapped in sushi haha. We didn't eat until after we made all the sushi, so we can take pictures, which is worth it, but by that time the rice was pretty dry. Anyway, if you want good sushi and you're in Tokyo don't make it yourself, go to a pro! But if you want a fun unique thing to do while you're in town then I recommend this tour for the experience. I love having such a small class, it was personal and intimate."

He is also very patient when teaching you how to make sushi. He throw's in mini-games to keep you entertained and engaged. If you love sushi or if you just want to have a great time, I HIGHLY recommend you to make an effort to take the tour! Cheers!"

I joined with two of my friends and we took a mid morning class and by the time we finished, it was time for lunch, which was perfect since we could eat our sushi creations. Our sushi making instructor Nagoya was really friendly and helpful. He picked us up infront of the metro near his house. From there it was a quick 5 minute walk to his place. Once we got in his house, he showed us around and then we got started on our sushi making class. Before getting started, he also gave us Japanese yukatas to wear, to make the atmosphere more fun. Before making sushi, he also gave a small talk on sushi history and the correct way to make and eat sushi. During the sushi making process, he was very helpful and patient. We made nigiri sushi, battleship sushi, and even artisan sushi. We went through the process step by step and the end result was great. It was especially satisfying being able to eat what we made afterwards. After the lesson, Nagoya walked us back to the metro stop and told us to feel free to email him if we had any questions about places to visit or Tokyo in general during our vacation. He's a really fun and nice person!"

It was funny, relaxing and inspiring!!"

We came out pleasantly surprised and realized it was one of the first activities we should've done when we arrived! The guide of this Sushi-Making Tour is Naoya Morishita. He's a really humble, down-to-earth Japanese guy who, frankly, speaks very good English for someone who did not study abroad. The entire lesson was very organized, engaging, and interest. We had a lot of fun learning the history of Sushi, the proper etiquettes, and making sushi. The best part came last: tasting your Japanese creation. I highly recommend the Tokyo Sushi-Making Tour :)"

Naoya was amazing in teaching my group of 4 how to make sushi.First, when we met him near the train station, he led us back to where we would be learning. Once we arrived, he immediately donned traditional Japanese clothing and gave us some to wear as well. From that point on, I knew it was going to be an unforgettable afternoon. After going thru some background information on sushi, Naoya asked us trivia questions about what we had learned. I thought this was a great way to have us remember the basics of sushi making. Our group was super competitive with making the best sushi and he had the tough job of judging whose was best. During the tour, we made approximately five or six different types of sushi/sashimi. Having never consumed sushi until this class, I was extremely hesitant to even try the tamest of sushi.After the tour completed, Naoya took us out to this amazing restaurant where we ate even more food and talked for hours. Overall, the afternoon flew by and it was a HUGE highlight of my trip to Tokyo.I cannot recommend this experience enough. I now know that I have a new friend in Tokyo."

He's really passionate about food and cooking and learning about other regions' cuisines!Definitely recommend this if you're a casual passer by looking for a quick crash course on making sushi. If you're a professional chef looking for something a bit more intensive, this probably isn't the right setting for you."

She had a great sense of humor and that made the experience fun as well as informative. One thing I loved was her attention to detail when cooking. She not only teaches you to cook the food but also to arrange it beautifully (which is not something I usually do). Yuriko's home is nice, clean and welcoming. It was easy to get to by subway (just a few minutes walk). I was hesitant to take my eight-year-old son to a cooking class; However, he did very well.

She was very communicative and provided detailed directions and instructions about the classes. When we were late, she was extremely forgiving and welcomed us into a relaxing and fun experience. There were two other students who were fun to talk to. Something that made Yurico's class stand out to me was that she told lots of stories as she was teaching us\u2013that a certain ingredient was something her mother used to use or the history of a particular food preparation technique. The work was fun and interactive and she was always happy to assist as necessary. The meal we ate at the end of the cooking class was wonderful (and large) and prepared us to work hard at calligraphy! Yurico was very patient with us as she gave an introduction to Japanese calligraphy, and offered helpful tips to use the brush and interesting background on its presence in culture today. I would highly recommend you visit Yurico for a beautiful and authentic afternoon."

She even managed to re-arrange an appointment with us during a typhoon in good time (the weather made it too dangerous to travel!). Her house really stands out from the crowd as well so its nice and easy to find and her directions made it even easier.As well as making gyoza we were also introduced to some side dishes and given insights into the differences between western and Japanese styles of food presentation. We were also instructed on cutting and salting techniques that could be applied to any recipe.We were even given photos free of charge as memento of our experience, this was definitely a highlight of our trip. Thank you Yurico"

I let Yurico know I was vegetarian and she very helpfully planned the lesson so I could make a vegetarian sushi roll, while my partner made the traditional version with fish. Yurico was very friendly and knowledgable and told us all about the ingredients and the correct way of preparing them, including the science of Japanese cooking. We had a lovely morning cooking and a delicious meal to enjoy after. I would recommend Yurico's cooking class to anyone wanting to learn some traditional Japanese cooking while in Tokyo."

As I do not eat any meat or fish, we opted to do the udon menu. It was really technical (and tough), but it was so fun and the meal was unbelievable. We made dashi, noodles, two veggies, and Yurico made us tamago when she learned that we had not yet tried it. Her home is beautiful and it was fun to cook with chopsticks (she did have utensils too). Yurico provided us with the recipes in English and we have used them since our class already. Yurico was so knowledgeable and it was great to learn about the food, cooking, and life in Japan. We had no issue getting to Yurico's home, or back to our hotel, by subway. We consider this an absolute must do when in Tokyo. We will definitely see her again for another class next trip!"

We were so inspired that we bought some Japanese kitchenwares during our travels so we could recreate the recipes properly back at home! Our lesson lasted about 3.5 hours as there were three of us and we went for a more complex recipe - there is a great variety of recipes to choose from on Yurico's website so you can take your pick. Yurico is a wonderful host, she is very engaging and friendly and made us feel very welcome and comfortable in her beautiful home - she even gave us tips for the rest of our travels through Japan!"

Despite us arriving late, she didn't hassle us to end the class on time, and she was very apologetic about us losing our way there. The class was only attended by my friend and I, so Yurico was able to be very attentive. Her kitchen was fantastic, super organised, clean and not as small as some of the other kitchens in Japan that we have been to. We asked her many questions on the tools that she used for the cooking process, and she gave us very good tips on where we would be able to get them. Maybe she should have a few of the items on standby to sell to her students as I'm sure others would have asked similar questions about buying Japanese kitchen tools. :)We had a great chat about family, travel and food while eating what we have cooked. I think we stayed at her apartment way beyond the time we were supposed to have ended the class. She speaks good English, which is really helpful for the cooking class.

Yurico was a very good teacher and provided us with printed recipes to take home. She explained which ingredients were essential and which wouldn't matter if you left out (you know, in case you don't have small dried shrimp lying around).

We prepared home made udon noodles , the dash soup and side dishes, she presented the dinner in a very elegant tray offering us sweet strawberries for dessert and we enjoyed everything at the end of the class sitting in the traditional japanese way.I have been very excited as I really found was I was expecting in terms of learning and traditional experience and I can only say Arigatogosaimas to Yurico for her class."

In addition, she was incredibly kind with our two children, ages 10 and 6. And we very much enjoyed eating our meal at the end! Really a wonderful experience, highly recommend."

I would recommend this to anyone interested in either getting to know some locals, japanese cooking (in particular the more practical and fun home cooking) and/or calligraphy! It is situated fairly centrally and is very easy to get to (5min from the subway station). Yurico is such a pleasure to get to know! She is a very good teacher, motivated and very knowledgeable. Not only does she have years of experience cooking for her family and friends on a daily basis, but she has also taken several professional cooking classes and food science classes. I learnt a lot not just about japanese cooking, but food science in general!The class itself teaches you a nice variety of dishes - I took the sushi maki class and made: sushi maki, miso soup (from scratch - i.e. making the stock first and then adding miso!) and two sides (delicious!). You get great tips along the way and some instructions to take home at the end. I also did a calligraphy class at the end - I found it was a great way to unwind after the cooking (almost meditative) and gave a great insight into Japanese culture. It's definitely worth investing in as well!"

She also indulged our requests to make an eggplant dish and to christen the knife we had bought the previous day at Kappabashi St (aka Kitchen St, which we'd highly recommend for foodie types, near Asakusa).Our meal was sensational, with the yakitori, tsukune, eggplant dish, a green bean dish, made-from-scratch miso soup and some lovely homemade yuzu pickles. We will definitely use the recipes again.It was also lovely to be in Yuriko's home, and I confess to some kitchen organisation envy ... a place for everything and everything in its place."

I cook a bit myself but I felt like a learnt a great deal about Japanese cooking. We also cooked a Japanese omlette, green beans with a sesame seed dressing (it was delicious) and an cold aubergine/eggplant dish. The Okonomiyaki was different to anything I'd had before but was really tasty.Yurico was a really lovely person, she gave us great advice for the rest of our trip about the best delicacies to try in each area of Japan.

We cooked 5 dishes that I got to choose , since I was the first to sign up for this particular class.Since her kitchen is not very large,so she keeps the class size small, which gives the students more time to interact, ask questions and get the \"hands on\" experience that I was looking for. Thank you Yurico. I will definitely tell all of my friends about the experience. I will recommend anyone traveling to Japan who wants this intimate and rewarding experience as well as learning to cook some excellent Japanese food, to take this class.I did, however have to go to some kitchen supply stores and buy an omelet pan and some other really cool gadgets to bring home , that make the dishes easier to prepare, which for me made it even more fun."

She was so welcoming and organized, and was able to work with our different styles. Her English is very good. Our son (15) was immediately comfortable and she involved him in all the doings and praised the things he did well. He was on cloud 9 by the end of the session. The dish, a kind of home-style rice and sushi comfort food with side vegetable dishes and miso, was excellent for explaining the preparation of the main foods in the Japanese diet. The calligraphy lesson was rewarding. Yurico helped us develop our word characters, then prepared models for us to work with in her own lovely calligraphy, and knew when we were ready to be left to try it for ourselves. It was very relaxing and absorbing. The afternoon was extremely good value, especially considering how involved the preparation of materials and patience necessary to work with different individual abilities. Really, really great."

She asked what kind of food we like and was very understanding when I told her I have a very picky eater (11 years old girl). She was very communicative throughout and even let me know when she was going to be away from town for a few days (and therefore not able to access her email) to make sure I didn't have any urgent questions for her before the visit. On the day of the visit it was extremely hot and she came out to drive us to her apartment from the subway (which was of course not part of the package but something she wanted to do to make her customers more comfortable. Her house was very sweet in a somewhat European style, very clean and very neat. We felt really welcome cooking there. Throughout the class Yurico was very positive and encouraging, and gave us lots of hints on how to improve our cooking. We can see she simply loves cooking and is a really great teacher. For the first time in my daughter's life she actually ate green beans and that itself was an achievement! The sushi was very fresh, the soup delicious and we had a fantastic time overall. I also asked her lots of questions about Japanese culture and felt I learnt a lot more than just cooking. Overall it was definitely a five star experience and I would most definitely go back if we are in tokyo again."

I've looked at many classes online but the thing that worried me the most was the fact that there are usually many people in a small kitchen, which takes away the hands-on experience.So from the large selection of cooking classes I ended up going with Yurico's class and I'm very happy I did. I booked about 4 days in advance and Yurico emailed me a few days in advance to ask what kind of menu I would like to make. She was really thoughtful and tailored the class to my wishes. The directions to her house were clear so I arrived well in time. The menu ended up being Gyoza (my #1 wish to learn how to make properly), green beans with sesame dressing, grilled eggplant and a leek and egg soup using her soup broth from chicken.The cooking was very eductional; Yurico explained a lot about the methods that are used (and why) and the ingredients (and also substitutes for when the ingredients are not available in my home country). One of my wishes beforehand was to learn about the broths for ramen but this simply was not possible in the time frame of the lesson. Instead, she taught me how to make a simply soup broth from a chicken breast (the chicken breast comes out amazingly tender by doing this btw!) and we actually made two soups, 1 with her broth and 1 with artificial flavouring, so that I could taste the difference. Everything ended up great, especially the gyoza were the best I've ever had.Yurico really goes out of her way to give a great and personal class. She had the recipes printed out and put into a nice plastic folder, she also wrote down the recipe for one of our spontaneous dishes. She is also very friendly and easy to talk to. she claims that her English is not very good but she is lying:) Both communication by email and at her home was pretty much flawless.This is normally the part where I list the negative points. However, I cannot think of a single thing!"

We recently travelled to Tokyo and are absolutely delighted we made the time to schedule a day with Yurico as a part of this trip . What a wonderful experience we had!From my original enquiry Yurico was only too happy to enter discussions to find a menu that would be suitable for us. Would we prefer beef or fish? A formal celebratory dish or something more ' everyday'. We decided upon our menu and signed up for her cooking class and the calligraphy session about a month in advance.On the day she met us at the local train station and we walked back to her home where we began cooking. - her blog and Facebook page talk about the menu we created (with pictures). The food was delicious ! Yurico was a humble lady who was well organised and a delight to talk with. She has attended many formal lessons in japanese cookery and was able to share many helpful hints with us throughout the day. Not only did we gain great insight into Japanese food but with teenagers of similar ages we discussed education, employment, politics and a range of other things we never would have had the chance to do in a large commercial cooking class. Following the cooking session we were guided in calligraphy scripture ( another area where Yurico was extremely insightful. her patience was apparent ( and very much appreciated) she allowed us many ' practice runs' before attempting our ' good copy'. Yurico offers a very personalised service. This was made so very apparent after I left my mobile phone on her bench ( didn't realise until several hours later). By the time we had dinner and arrived back at our hotel she had been in contact with the concierge and messages were left about the incident. On arrival home from work her husband personally drove my phone back to my hotel. We were overwhelmed with their kindness and generosity.I cannot recommend yurico's classes highly enough. We are hopeful that in the future we can return and take our children to experience this delightful insight into Japanese food, art, culture and hospitality."

We started by sitting around her Japanese table with cushioned chairs sipping Japanese tea while Yurico explained what we will be preparing for our lunch. I loved that Yurico offered something different but traditional to her menu, as most places seem to stick to only sushi and tempura. Everything on the menu was prepared in such detail and as a result the flavour and texture of the food was a real delight to eat. My 10 year old daughter prepared the dessert with Yurico called dorayaki which were 2 little japanese pancakes filled with custard cream\u2026..mmmmmm delicious!

Her home is warm and welcoming and I immediately felt comfortable. If you're looking for a fun afternoon or evening learning about Japanese cooking in a comfortable atmosphere, this is for you."

We so enjoyed Yurico 's class.Her home was easy to find and as it was raining she met us at the train station.We made udon noodles from scratch which we will now make at home, far better than the prepackaged ones. The deep fried tofu in mirin and soy garnished our Kitsune udon. For one who doesn't like tofu I have been converted. A Japanese grilled e,gg plant accompanied the dish as well as tempuredfish paste tubes. Another great hit.Yurico is an enthusiastic teacher eager to make sure we tried many Japanese treats. As we wished to take home some of the ingredients Yurico took us to the supermarket and helped purchase the products.We had a fantastic day learning so so so much about the finer points of Japanese food in a most enjoyable way. Her classes are new and the enthusiasm and eagerness to teach about Japanese food was infectious. We would take another class when in Tokyo again. We like the class as it was in a real home and not in a commercial kitchen and part of a large group. Thank you Yurico for a wonderful day."

We spent an awesome day with Yurico learning how to prepare delicious Japanese food with great care. Our udon noodles were amazing. We prepared Inara and miso from scratch. We also prepared eggplant and cucumber salad with chicken and simmered lotus root. What I really enjoyed about Yurico is her love of food. She makes her own plum wine, pickles and she kept bringing things out to show us what we need to look for. I run my own cooking class in Australia and have been to many cooking classes in other countries. This is the best."

Her lovely home is conveniently located in central Tokyo and close to several stations. She will come and meet you if you want.Yurico is a charming and friendly hostess who loves cooking and meeting new people. Her English is pretty good so you won't have any real problems communicating.She introduced a number of recipes to us, some traditional and some a little more modern. Yurico likes to make things from scratch and her dishes are authentic, but she also adds her own uniques touches here and there. She is happy to share her tips and answer questions. At the end of the lesson, you can all sit down for a relaxed meal.Whether you are just visiting Japan for a short time and want to see a glimpse of family life, or whether you have lived in Japan for some time and want to learn more about Japanese cuisine, you will have a fun time cooking with Yurico. My friends and I all learned something new during our visit."

The food tour done by Arigato Japan in Kyoto was amazing for many reasons; the introduction to wide range of Japanese cuisine - (it is so much more than the sushi restaurants of North America) the informative and enjoyable discussions that I had with the tour guide Toshi, the picture taking opportunities, walking the streets in the evening searching for elusive geishas. and a special thanks to Arigato for doing the tour for one guest (me) after others dropped out. Definitely a tour company that is committed to serving its clients."

Toshi San not only spoke fluent English, he also was a fount of knowledge about the culture and history of Kyoto, and led us around the market, sampling different tastes and buying ingredients that were later served up at a nearby classy restaurant.

We spent a couple of days in Tokyo before boarding a cruise ship that took us down the coast to Nagasaki and, eventually, Shanghai. We have now made it a habit to take food tours in 'new' cities, and this tour was one of the very best.Our guide, Maya, was charming, friendly and very knowledgable.There were only four of us on the tour, which meant that it seemed more personal. Dusk was gathering as we set off, and increasingly the neon and LED advertising started to predominate - very atmospheric!The first stop was at a small restaurant where two Japanese specialities, one from Hiroshima and one from Nagasaki, were tantalisingly cooked in front of us on a hotplate. One of our fellow guests had food preferences that were immediately catered for. The second stop was at a bar/restaurant specialising in dishes from Hokkaido, which meant that by the end of the tour we had spanned Japan from north to south in culinary terms!Along the way, Maya was explaining about Tokyo and Japan in a very informative way - after all, food tours are supposed to get you into a city's culture and history as well as it's cuisine. She also accompanied us on the Metro after the tour to make sure that we reached our hotel without difficulty. We can therefore thoroughly recommend this tour and this company."

We were divided to two groups when walking but over our food stops we were all in one table so everyone still got to know each other and it is one of the best tours I\u2019ve ever been to! This All star Food tour in Tokyo is a great way to really experience Tokyo the local way! We got to try some drinks, really loved the highball and the yakitori on the first stop. The second stop was even betther The food potions were good, we were so full and we didn\u2019t realize we sill had dessert! Wow, this was really a great tour!

The second stop was fresh veggies with miso dipping sauce, gyoza nabe, udon noodles, chicken namba, tuna rice balls, taro balls, fish pizza and chicken sashimi - yes, raw chicken but it was not at all what I expected, very good. The final stop was a fish shaped dessert custard which was the perfect finish. While enroute to our food stops Maya showed us the back streets, shops, bars and restaurants of the local neighborhoods and answered all of our questions in perfect English.

Sometimes the guide didn't speak English very well, our questions went half-answered and the experiences we had were not what we were hoping for. Thankfully, our experience with Kanda-san was more than we could have asked for. Every step of the way we were explained the history of the steps we took and the food we ate. Along the way we tried tsukemono, kushi katsu, sashimi tofu and it was all delicious. The whole time our guide was collecting food for our end of the tour lunch at an amazing little japanese restaurant tucked away in the heart of the market. We 100 and 10 percent recommend this tour for anyone looking for a complete understanding of what the Nishiki Market has to offer and how it sustained the city of Kyoto then and even now."

Let me just say this tour was so educational and fun. The rest of the group had a cancellation so Arigato gave us the option of doing the tour with another group another day or staying same day for our tour for a private experience. We opted to keep the same day since we had other plans different days and we didn't regret it because it was more personalized and we had a blast with Maiya who was outgoing and sociable and fun to be around. Maiya has great English and was able to explain to us the different areas and even talked about the high quality fruits we have been seeing in both the \"cheaper fruit stalls\" and the most luxurious fruit shop in ginza. We were pleasantly surprised also the amount of food we were fed on the tour as there was a lot of food we couldn't even finish. The restaurant we went to was awesome with great service and we opted to pay extra for extra alcoholic drinks and also added some pickled vegetables that we paid for to try.

The lunch was absolutely enjoyable and we will never forget the experience , I highly recommend this tour!"

I would have never found the narrow, charming and historical streets of golden gai! I have been on other tours but this was by far the best, the guide, Anne was very passionate, fun and knowledgeable! She helped us with our other plans for Tokyo as well which was a big plus, she spoke perfect English ! There was not a dull moment, the whole group was very happy the whole night. Overall, this was really the highlight of our trip. From the food selection, information, guide and coordination, this is really a top caliber tour that's very affordable! Glad we took this tour, would love to come back and try the rest of their tours as well"

We decided to book the NISHIKI MARKET TOUR, it was so great! We got to try so many things from sake, tofu donuts, tofu skin, fish and japanese eggs that were so tasty! The tour was with only 6 people, it was very intimate and we got to ask so many questions. Every place where we stopped was just heaven! All the food samplings were great and we really loved the flow of the tour, honestly it all went so fast because we had so much fun. I definitely will book their Tokyo tours next time we visit.

Anne, the owner and our tour guide for the evening, was absolutely fantastic. Her love of Tokyo was apparent as she pointed out fun facts about the city and gave us plenty of restaurant recommendations and tips for the rest of our trip. We were in a small group of 6, including my husband and I, and she took the time to get to know us and our preferences. She lead us through random narrow streets of local izakayas, which we would have never found on our own, to the wide streets of luxury shops in Ginza. We sampled super tasty skewers and drinks on the second floor of some random building (again, we would've never discovered this place by ourselves), stuffed ourselves with local dishes (udon, dumplings, fried chicken, raw chicken, the most delicious miso paste ever). We finished off the evening with a crispy golden Taiyaki (pastry in the shape of a fish) oozing with custard goodness. By the end of the tour, we were patting our bellies in satisfaction. We also randomly ran into her in Kyoto and had dinner with her! Thanks, Anne for such a memorable experience on our honeymoon!"

The food tour was on our first night in Tokyo with a small, friendly group and our guide Anne was amazing - so welcoming and knowledgable and showed us places we'd never have found on our own that gave us the insight for places to go during the rest of the trip. As well as some great restaurants, we also went to some really cool shops and a food hall so you really do have a varied, interesting and fun evening with some awesome food thrown in!The sushi-making class was also in a small group in a nice apartment with really friendly and informative tutors. You learn a lot about what goes into traditional Japanese sushi and make a load of things with a choice of ingredients that you get to eat at the end. Again, a brilliant way to spend a couple of hours! All in all we can't recommend Arigato enough - great value for money and a really cool way to throw yourself into seeing and doing things you normally wouldn't."

I recommend this walking tour to be taken at the beginning of your trip because Anne (the owner) showed us so many hidden passageways filled with izakayas ! We would have loved to go back and explore these places if we had more time . The Food/ walking tour started in Yurakucho through Ginza and ended in Shimbashi. Anne met us directly outside of the Yurakucho station and after short introductions of the group we were on our way through 3 cities. During the tour we learned a lot about the culture, people and places of Japan. We explored lots of hidden alleys and narrow passageways that we wouldn't have even thought to enter. At our first stop we had some yakitori. It was a little sampler with 5 different kinds. The minced meat was my favorite. The tour also comes with two drinks and with Anne's suggestions, I tried highball and plum wine. Two popular drinks in Japan and both were amazing. We walked through Ginza and saw some outrageously priced fruits at some markets and a lot of high end + name brand stores. Great area for shopping. Our next restaurant was located in Ginza. We had a great meal which included : Raw vegetables with Miso. The best miso I've ever had. We even purchased a few bottles to take home with us; fried chicken with tartar sauce- juicy and the tartar sauce was delicious; chicken sashimi ! Taste like chicken! The food regulations in Japan are strict and we had no problem trying this recommended dish; gyoza soup- this was one of our favorite dishes. So simple but so good. The gyoza was so soft and the broth was so tasty . We had it with a little yuku to add a little fresh citrus flavor; rice ball with American cheese ; udon ; blacken charcoal chicken- this was their regional special and award winning at that. It was very smoky and juicy; a thin crust pizza with little white fish, miso paste and furukake . I could have eaten the whole thing. It was so light and easy to eat. And for dessert we had mango jelly! The best part about this meal aside from being able to try 8 dishes was that there was always extra so if we wanted more servings we were able to have more of our favorite dish. The tour continued with dessert at a stand that served the equivalency to a pressed cream puff in the shape of a fish. Our choice of custard or azuki bean paste filling ( I chose custard). It was warm and delicious. After our dessert we walked through Shimbashi where there were a lot more little alleyways filled with izakayas (bars)! Anne explained that a lot of salarymen worked around the area and would have their late night dinner or drinks there. We left the tour with full bellies and a lot of recommendations for food, shopping, sites and other izakaya alleys in the cities we were staying in. Anne has a great heart and a true passion for food, culture and friendship. Arigato for all of your recommendations and amazing food tour!"

My husband and I were in Tokyo on an apartment hunting trip and decided to learn a little bit about Japanese food and culture by going on the Shibuya Food Tour. We met our guide, Timothy, outside Shibuya station. Despite the craziness we were able to find him easily. We started our tour by doing a short walk through some of the less seen areas of Shibuya and getting a bit of a history of the importance of culture and food in Japan. Our first stop was at an Okonomiyaki restaurant. It was fantastic. Timothy provided excellent information on what we were about to eat, the flavours that we would taste and the differences in the two different styles. Needless to say it was a very tasty stop. We then moved on to Tsukada farms and got a taste of several chicken dishes. By the time we were done were stuffed, but we walked over to one of the department stores and headed to the basement. We never seen so many beautiful desserts. It was wonderful.Timothy was an excellent host and after finding out we were moving even offered to help us out once our family arrives in our new home. It was such a nice gesture as Tokyo can be very overwhelming. We enjoyed our evening, got a great taste of some Japanese food that we had never heard of, and We will definitely recommend Arigato to any friends and family that come over for a visit."

This was our first visit to Japan, and food and drink (90% plus of menus are in Japanese kanji) was a bit of a challenge, not knowing what you're ordering. So being guided was something we were looking forward to. Our guide, Ayumi, was wonderful. She did everything possible to be a great host, inform, entertain, and keep our small group moving. She provided a great balance of factual information and storytelling about Japan and Tokyo, more than enough to fill the three hours.We most enjoyed going in to small, out-of-the-way spots that tourists wouldn't visit on their own. Yakitori and plum wine at the first spot. Yum! A walk-through of a high-end Ginza department store food hall (kind of like Harrod's). Multiple dishes at the next spot... Japanese cucumber and miso dip, dumpling stew, fried chicken and delicious dip, yakisoba, a sardine pizza (we're not crazy about fish), egg omelette and a dessert treat. Delicious, fun and much more food than expected! Personal recommendation: try plum wine with club soda (a sort of plum wine \"spritzer), especially if it's a warm day. Awesome!After a bit more walking, Ayumi had us stop at a sidewalk shop and bought us custard-filled fish-shaped waffles called Taiyaki, after showing us a beautiful, little out-of-the way Shinto shrine down a Tokyo alley.The experience is well worth the price and we would \"highly recommend.\" It's an outstanding mixture of food, culture, sights, information and pleasant little surprises. You won't regret this tour."

Our teacher, Shirley, was very professional and had proper training to teach this class. She was extremely patient and taught us everything we need to know about japanese cooking. We started the class by making dashi , I had no idea that doing it the traditional way definitely made the food taste better! It was unbelievably good and nutritious! After this we made 3 other side dishes, the tamagoyaki or Japanese egg omelette was so fun for me and my husband we ended up making them when we came back to the US! Shirley taught us how to make a super easy and really tasty pumpkin with sesame seed side dish, it was so yummy! Finally we made some grilled teriyaki fish, this was definitely the highlight of the class! I've never made fish this good, thank you to Arigato for teaching me the simplest techniques I definitely didn't know about! What an enjoyable and fun class!I have attended two other cooking classes in our previous trips in Japan but this obento class with Arigato Japan was definitely the best!!! Highly recommended, they even gave us recipes that we have already used with some of our meals! A must try cooking class in Tokyo!!"

We also were able to taste some outstanding Japanese sweets. While walking through the neighborhoods, Anne was able to share some wonderful knowledge and insights. As wonderful and the locations and food was, Anne was the best part. She was fun, passionate, and knowledgeable and really went out of her way to make sure that everyone had a great time.

We walked around for three hours with stops at wonderful restaurants, assorted shops and even a depachika, which is what the Japanese call the food store in the basement level of a department store. It was amazing!We sampled all kinds of incredible foods. Our first stop was at a small yakitori restaurant where we ate five types of yakitori, drank plum wine and I had my first ever highball (it was really good)! Anne explained that the highball, which is made with whiskey and club soda, had become a very popular drink in Japan.Anne is a fantastic guide. She speaks English like a US native and it was like walking around Tokyo with an old friend. In addition to the food and drink, she took us to the smallest police station in Tokyo, showed us where to buy a forty dollar melon and explained why it costs so much and much more.Our final stop was at a restaurant which specializes in food from the Kyushu region of Japan. We started the meal with raw cucumber and cabbage that we dipped in a fantastic miso dip. Then dumpling stew, Japanese fried chicken, yakisoba, and our favorite, the tender grilled chicken bits that we dipped into a spicy yuzu seasoning before eating it. Heavenly!I should add that she took a lot of photos and even some videos, which she sent to us afterwards. If you're ever in Tokyo, take this tour!!!"

When she found out I was spending only one day in Tokyo and had seen next to nothing, she changed up our route on the fly and made sure that I got to see more Tokyo landmarks. It's clear she loves meeting people and showing off the city. She even put in a huge effort to try and find me a manicure appointment the next morning - highly beyond the call of duty.

We discovered Arigato Japan Food Tours and Cooking Classes through Reddit, and it seemed like a fun thing to do on our first visit to Japan. It turned out to be a great choice! We opted for the obento course, where we made a proper Japanese lunch consisting of teriyaki chicken, tamagoyaki (egg rolls), miso soup, steamed spinach and seasoned rice, all fashionably presented in an obento box (or at least we tried!)Our teacher was highly prepared, very patient, and not only did she teach us about Japanese lunches, but talked about her own experiences, upbringing and everyday life, and we really felt we learned a lot about food and lunch culture in Japan. On top of that, we got a really tasty lunch, in addition to the crash course in Japanese cuisine. The course took place in an apartment building, we had a little trouble finding it because we expected something more commercial, but it was at the address as stated, a short walk from the subway - you just had to go through a hallway by some mail boxes and up an elevator, it was clearly marked from there. And to be honest, cooking in what felt more like a home had a lot of charm.The course itself was a lot of fun, we enjoyed trying to cook with chopsticks, but were luckily offered a trusty spatula. We have a lot of learning to do, that's for sure. We learned about different seasonings and common everyday Japanese ingredients, and how a regular breakfast and lunch looks like - much different from the bread based food we usually have in Norway. We were the only course participants that day, and had the teacher to ourselves, which was really nice, and allowed us to talk quite a bit.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a genuine Japanese experience, couples, families, young or old. They also offer Food Tours, which we are keen on trying the next time we're travelling to Japan, as well as the other cooking courses. All in all, it was a charming and fun experience, with a crew that really love what they are doing!"

After touring the city using the guide books I thought I had experienced all that Tokyo had to offer. Boy was I wrong! The guide books barely scratched the surface. Nothing compares to experiencing a city with a local guide, they tell you things you won\u2019t find in books and take you off the beaten path. Anne was an absolutely perfect guide. Warm and pleasant from the second I met her. She was extremely knowledgeable about Tokyo and Japan and took me on a tour around the city to places and areas only the locals know about. She explained in great detail the history of each area as well as the food I enjoyed. Possibly the most enjoyable part of the tour was the cultural emersion. Anne explained the many cultural nuances of Japan/Tokyo and I finished the tour with a much greater understanding and appreciation of the country and its people. I had such a good time I booked two more tours that week. Anne also helped me set up my trip to the rest of Japan, which was invaluable. Not only would I strongly recommend the Arigato Japan experience I actually believe it is a must if you want to truly experience Tokyo from a local perspective."

Most importantly, the food itself was delicious and very filling. I typically find miso soup somewhat bland, but the one we made during the class was rich with flavour. Anne also took photos throughout and posted them on Facebook so that we could look back on the experience and share them with our friends. I was grateful for that as it allowed me to focus fully on the lesson without needing to take my own photos. We were also given a copy of the recipe.

She showed us the proportions used and the visuals to look out for in making the broth. As simple as it was, there was a full science behind watching the temperature and timing to execute this flavorful broth. She also gave us pointers for other uses of this broth. Our hands-on participation came in the sushi prep work. We learned to flavor, cool and mix the sushi rice. The rolling and forming was quite a skill to learn. Tomoko was very encouraging as this was our first time making sushi. We had a palette of ingredients to work with. Each of our sushi was created to reflect our personal style. Next was the best part, we ate our creations! Complimented by the soup, side dishes, green tea and followed by dessert. Learning and eating is the best combination. Anne provided information on the ingredients used and where I can buy these groceries locally. We even got recommendations for various local attractions to the rest of our vacation."

The food on the tour was phenomenal- every stop offered something exciting and delicious. Not only were we able to try out a variety of traditional Japanse food, but she introduced us to a couple of the different 'boroughs' of Tokyo...suggesting great places to visit over the next couple of days.

Kanemoto was awesomely knowledgeable, and took us all around Ginza pointing out historical sights, and plenty of modern areas that we would have never found. He took us in a department store which sounds silly, but actually was great, and even bought us a fancy dessert for after dinner. We went to an izikaya where we drank some sake, beer, and ate grilled skewers of chicken. We walked thru the tight spots under the train observing locals getting off work and unwinding. We ate chicken sashimi hesitantly, but once in our mouths there was no regret: It was damn good. Kanemato would tell us about the food, and also about Kabuki.

After finally making our way to the meeting spot, she walked right up to us to confirm who we were (I'm sure we looked a little lost), and then off we went! We stopped at a few scheduled bars/pubs for food and drink and were pretty much full after the first stop. But the food did not stop, nor did the conversation! We also enjoyed hearing about the city from a local, everything from food and dining, to current events and what it's like to live in the city! We also passed by a few places that weren't on the tour (at our request) to hear about some history. We sat and enjoyed a few more locations before wrapping up - and there was no hurry to end! I felt like we could have been out all night. Had we not been jet-lagged, that probably would have been the case. This tour was the perfect first full night in Tokyo for us and gave us a better idea of the different parts of town too. I'd recommend Elizabeth Anne to anyone, and will reach out to her again on our next visit."

A local patron at one of the izakayas came over and visited with us.One of the best food tours we have ever experienced. Don't think about it - just call them and set it up!

As foodies, we always seek out the best cooking schools and food tours on offer and this is what set Arigato apart for us when researching.From the outset, Anne was a pleasure to deal with. She was quick to respond to us. She's an extremely endearing and warm person who you will quickly fall in love with.She showed us round the izakayas of Yurakucho, Ginza and Shinbashi, focusing on the ones serving the best quality. We saw this in izakaya we'd previous visited by ourselves and had been a bit disappointed by the quality of the meat (language barrier didn't help of course). Anne knows the best ones who use fresh ingredients - everything we tried was delicious, particularly the yaki tori (chicken skewer BBQ) and miso prizes in the final izakaya.Oh - look out for the raw chicken sashimi. This divided us as you can expect - but you have to try it!Excellent tour, good value for money and a great way to get a taster of Tokyo for first timers - or even for those (like us) returning to the city for their 2nd visit."

There was a teacher, the owner, and 2 helpers in a small apartment. They were busy cleaning and it looked unprepared. We waited until 3 more students showed up. And the nightmare begins when she introduced us to 2 video bloggers that walked in! As you can imagine, how the class went. It was very distracting. I know this is a great publicity but it is not fair to those who paid for the class and really wanted to learn. The bloggers were constantly taking videos of themselves and did not bother asking permission from us when they were taking pictures. It was very unprofessional of the owner. She couldn't remember how much she advertised the class for and we paid 4900 \u00a5 each. When we returned home, I found out that it was posted on the Facebook page for 9500 \u00a5 for two. The teacher was good but she put more attention in bringing in props for the tea ceremony presentation. There was confusion on how many daifuku we get to make and we only ended making one each. Once the class ended we fled. On the way out, I expressed my disappointment and she apologized but it was a little too late for that. She knew that 2 video bloggers were attending the class. When we signed up for the class she could have mentioned it to us. I would pay a little more for a class at Buddha Bellies Cooking School. I guess you pay for what you get! I will email a copy of this review to the owner, Anne and give her a chance to explain. Will update later if she does."

Our teachers were top-notch \"chefs\" in their own right, having cooked for their families for a long time. They were well-versed in English and clearly explained the step-by-step process of cooking the soup, preparing the rice for the sushi, and eventually putting the sushi together in an artistic manner. The best part was that we got to EAT what we made and they were delicious! We also met some wonderful people who belong to the international community and a few locals. Indeed, this was half a day well-spent! Thank you Arigato Japan!"

Regular class schedule and website made booking and payment in advance easy (I booked about 10 days in advance, so relatively spontaneous booking is possible!). Location was easy to find and right next to the Metro exit. The Udon-class itself was wonderful: Small group, nice atmosphere, host speaks fluent English and everything is well-prepared. Cooking was really fun and the outcome was delicous. I especially liked that we received the recipes afterwards with information on how to get the right ingredients back at home, so it's easy to cook everything authentically at home.Price is definitely a fair deal for this high-quality experience. Wonderful!I'll be back for another class on my next visit to Tokyo for sure!"

It was all delicious and easy to make. Ayuko also offered a very special bonus of homemade Plum wine or juice- This is what \"foodies\" dream about. She provided the recipes and is available for further advice (after I forgot something when I got home). The studio is compact but charming and filled with enticing books on cooking, gardening and Japanese culture. I highly recommend the experience!!"

During our 4-week stay in Japan, we experienced a lot of fantastic things, from experiencing the full glory of sakura season, learning how to make traditional Japanese sweets in Yugawara, and scoring a cooking class at Buddha Bellies on short notice during our 5 days in Tokyo. We had failed to plan ahead sufficiently and emailed Ayuko on short notice to inquire about any classes. Knowing how busy she was, I was impressed with how quickly she responded and arranged a sushi-making class for the next day. The price was very reasonable, class size was small and intimate, the space was comfortable and brimming with books, and all ingredients and equipment was provided. She provided a nice encapsulation of the history of sushi and the different types of sushi. As well, she entertained some of our random questions. You really appreciate how hard it is to make sushi after taking Ayuko's class. None of us could manage to properly grab a handful of sushi rice without using gloves. Even making a roll was tricky but she patiently walked us through the techniques. Being able to enjoy the fruits of our labor, even if it didn't look as beautiful as sushi you'd get in a restaurant, was great fun, accompanied by either beer or sake and a little sweet. The parting gift of the printed recipe and the bamboo sushi roller topped off the visit. If your Japanese is nonexistent/terrible, thereby necessitating a class in English, and you want to take a cooking class, Ayuko is the person to go to. Not only is she a consummate professional, but you have plenty of options of classes to choose from! I only wish we had more time to check out some other classes. The next time in Tokyo we hope to drop in again and I highly recommend Buddha Bellies if you're thinking of taking a class."

She picked us up at the train station, introduced us to Japanese cooking and dining. We cooked, tasted, sniffed, and ate, we laughed and had really good times. After the class, Ayuko gave us enough time to enjoy our creations and ask all possible questions not only about Japanese food. I really enjoyed her wonderful book collection and even bought a handy little book on Japanese culture. Ayuko was very kind and helped me figure out a perfect walk in the area, suggested spots to visit and even made a call to a museum to see if it was opened which saved me a ride across the entire Tokyo as the museum was closed.

In our class we learned how to make sushi, miso and gyouza. Not only was Ayuko very good at instructing us on the techniques, she also gave us so much interesting background as to why things were done the way they were. It was fascinating to learn how Tokyo's samurai culture had influenced sushi compared to the more artistic Kyoto. We also got to see (and feel!) the hardest food in the world! The yuzu sake we sampled was amazing as well. Overall I highly recommend the class. Ayuko is a fabulous instructor and does an amazing job of making it a very personal and educational experience! We had a blast!"

We were asked to start at 9 am instead of 11 am because of some problems with the location. This itself was not a problem for us, but we had the impression that our teacher was very hectic and we we were a burden even though she was nice. Maybe she was hectic because she had someone come in to fix the air conditioner (which was the reason why we were asked to come earlier) but I think as a customer we can still expect good service. We did get a package of miso paste to compensate for the inconvenience of coming earlier but would have liked a relaxed teacher more. The food we cooked was nothing special. I think people who go for cooking classes like cooking and know the basics about it, so it is not unusual to expect something special when you go for such a class. The food we cooked was good but not something we couldn't have managed with a good cookbook. The only really interesting thing was making the dashi and learning about the different ingredients, but here we had to ask what the different things were, because our teacher assumed we already knew.When it came to eating the food, our teacher went into the kitchen and cleaned up instead of sitting and chatting with us, which would have been the perfect opportunity to share some special knowledge about Japanese cuisine. All in all, we were dissappointed with what we experienced and are sorry to say that we cannot recommend this to people who like cooking and know their way around a kitchen."

I took two classes at Buddha Bellies: a bento box class and a fish cutting class. Ayuko, who runs the class, is an extremely good teacher who gives clear instructions and can answer questions about the methodology behind her recipes. Her English is extremely good, as she has also spent time teaching English in Japanese schools.When the fish cutting class that I had originally signed up for was cancelled, Ayuko went out of her way to find another time that would work and gave me a private lesson in fish cutting. I have since purchased and read a few books about Japanese knives and proper techniques for cutting fish and am super appreciative of Ayuko teaching me the sanmae oroshi technique, which I feel I would never have completely understood from reading books.Ayuko went out of her way to make my experience awesome, and packed me a sushi dinner from the fish I had cut at the end of our class for me to take to the airport. I nearly missed my flight because I was still making sushi in her class, but based on the quality of the instruction I feel that the risk was well worth it."

My family, 2 adults and 2 children ages 10 and 12, participated in a full day of classes at Buddha Bellies Cooking School during our visit to Tokyo in June, 2015. We all loved these classes and recommend them highly. We took three classes in one day, in the following order: 1. Fish Cutting, 2. Sushi Preparation, 3. Cooking Chicken Teriyaki with homemade Udon noodles.I recommend the third class if you have younger children. The first two classes do require dexterity, concentration and care since students use large, extremely sharp traditional knives. But if your children are ready for it, as mine were, all of these classes were awesome.The host teacher, Ayuki, is truly a great teacher and highly skilled chef. Furthermore, she is fluent in English and also provided a written set of instructions in English to take home. She encouraged us to take pictures as we performed the tasks so that we wouldn't forget any of the steps.There is also a small but very good library/bookstore where you can read (during class breaks) about other artistic and creative aspects of Japanese culture that might appeal to you, such as traditional carpentry, in addition to the many cookbooks.In summary, this was a highlight of our visit to Tokyo."

She was such a friendly and relaxed teacher that even when I coated myself AND the table AND the floor in bean paste, I didn't feel too embarrassed. She is so knowledgable so be sure to ask her lots of questions about the history of the food and about her cooking experience. She knows a lot about sake, for example...

The one major problem we had was that we booked early and understood we were the only two people for the 'personal' fish cutting lesson. Much to our surprise, another person showed up and had a negative impact on what could have been a great experience - there were only 2 cutting boards and knives and he hogged them both, actually complaining that Ayuko needed to get another cutting board/knife set. Ayuko should have gone for quality of instruction vs quantity of money.Ayuko is a professionally trained sushi expert and she shares her knowledge of Japan and sushi easily. While we have made sushi at home before, it was a good 'refresher' for us. There was not really any 'cooking' as she essentially prepared everything ahead of time (sliced fish, rice, etc.) - all you have to do is form the sushi.So compared to other actual cooking experiences, the actual cooking part was short and sweet, with little 'adult beverages', taught by a very friendly sushi expert. Once will be enough for us."

The cooking school was just close to Exit A2 of Jimbocho Station. And when we got there, the place was full of interesting books that we ended up buying a book on Japanese knives and another on edomae (Tokyo style) sushi. It was just me and my husband for the fish cutting class--we were to cut and fillet mackerel--and we enjoyed it tremendously learning about the basic techniques using a deba knife perfect for cutting and filleting fish, then a yanagiba knife for slicing sashimi. We were so impressed with the performance of Japanese knives that we went straight to Kamaasa in Kappabashi, as Ayuko recommended, after our class and bought ourselves a set each (for right handed left handed). Afterwards, we were joined by 6 others and we started with making the sushi rice. First, she taught us how to make a fancy sushi roll. Then next was the edomae sushi--how to form the rice in our hands and turn it into a shape of sushi, put wasabi, then form it again with tuna, salmon, mackerel, and squid. One of the students was vegetarian so he made an entirely different set--which by the way turned out very colourful and unique. Then, of course, the eating came next with sake or beer; we were so full by the time we finished. It wasn't the best sushi I ever ate in Tokyo, but it surely was the sweetest since I made it myself. =) Now my husband and I are so happy that we get to entertain at home serving sushi. Thank you, Ayuko!"

She gives you a brief background on the history of sushi, the different kinds of sushi, and then the rest of the class is interactive/hands on. We made a total of 7 different kinds of nigiri and one decorative roll. The best part is eating it at the end, however, you almost don't want to after all the hard work that was put into the presentation. When I showed my friends and family a photo of our creation, they couldn't believe that we had made such a beautiful plate of sushi. I look forward to re-creating this recipe for friends and family at home. The class size was small which gave it an intimate feel. We were in class with people from 5 different nationalities (Holland, Norway, Germany, Australia, and Japanese) which made for a pretty incredible experience.

My brother and I took the class where we made a main (pork or salmon), 2 side dishes (rolled egg and sesame beans), miso soup from scratch and flavoured rice. Ayuko is a fantastic teacher and explains everything so well! We had a visit from Fuji TV where we were filmed for a Tv show to be aired in September - can't wait! Of course, the most exciting thing that everyone looks forward to is eating your own food you cooked at the very end. A simple way of cooking, and I will definitely be cooking this back at home. Definitely recommend taking a class with Ayuko!"

Akiyama san was able to cater to all our dietary restrictions by designing a tofu teriyaki set for my vegetarian colleague, and the chicken teriyaki set for the rest of us. Care was also taken to make sure the dashi (base soup) is vegetarian, and there is no pork element in the meals. She shared many helpful cooking and preparation tips. My colleagues enjoyed themselves thoroughly, which had contributed to their enjoyable experience in Japan."

            "review": "Good Class. Ayuko was a very nice host to us and I did have fun in the class. We cooked a chicken teriyaki and Udon. I have done several other cooking classes, but this one missed on a few points. The first issue with the class was the price. At $70 this is an expensive 2-3 hours to spend with someone, especially when there are six other people in the room with you. I expected more value for the price. I also understand Tokyo is a very expensive city, but with the ingredients we used (chicken, some sauces and flour) I did not feel the money was well spent on ingredients. The second issue with the class is that the hands on portions of the class. Ayuko spent a lot of her time in the kitchen cleaning dishes and preparing the ingredients for the next meal; a task I would have preferred to help with and do (not the cleaning, the prep work for the meals). The final comment is about how we prepared the Udon. This was not an issue, but we could have spent our time learning other things and preparing other dishes. I say this because we spent about 20-25 minutes stepping on the Udon (this is how you prepare large batches so your hands don't become tired). It was a cool thing to do, but one round would have worked or we could have been learning additional things while we were doing this task. There were some positives from the class. The people from the class were very fun, and Ayuko is a great host and person. She was very nice and did a good job explaining dishes as we were making them. Ayuko also taught me a lot about Japanese culture and how some of the customs work. She has a beautiful home and the class is easy to find. She will meet you at the subway and walk you to her class. Ayuko's English is also very good and if you have some questions she will help.Recommendations to make the class better: if the chicken teriyaki and udon is a class I would suggest adding something else to the class to make the class more full of activities. I would also suggest making the recipe book better quality. Some of the classes I have done in the past will give you a book with recipes and descriptions at the end of the book with descriptions of ingredients (pictures sometimes!) so when you go home you can find the ingredients you are cooking with."

This most recent visit was trying out their newest offering, washoku, which just received UNESCO Intangible Asset designation. We were treated to a mini-miso tasting, made several traditional Japanese dishes, and taught how to properly plate based on importance of food. The recipes were easy to understand and Ayu provided additional insight to specialized ingredients. She explained the day and then began leading us through each of the dishes. At the end, we were treated to our homemade meal. I can't wait to try these recipes again at home as well as join another class. The only problem is which class to join next!"

The class is laid out so that once you learn how to make the fancy roll, making more basic rolls makes a lot of sense and you can figure it out on your own. I also was surprised by how difficult making sushi is, some people can make it look so easy. The class itself was very good but...The thing that makes Buddha Bellies really stick out is that Ayuko is a fantastic teacher. I instantly felt welcomed and at ease. Ayuko is extremely friend and she's very good at teaching. Her English is excellent as well. She really makes this course stand out extremely well. It's one of the my favorite things I've done on my trip, and I've been backpacking for 2 months across China, Korea, and Japan. I give her a lot of credit, the class is laid out so it will teach you how to do a lot of things given the time that you're there. My only complaint is that I only took one course for sushi and it's far too late in my vacation to plan another one. The time flew by, I had no idea two hours passed. Ayuko definitely knows what she is doing, and she's friendly and a great teacher. Also, make sure you plan way ahead if you're going to do this class. I started looking as soon as I got into Japan (I was here for about a month) and the only thing I could book was toward the end of my stay. I would strongly suggest booking in advance of your trip or you will be disappointed."

Since we all love to eat Japanese food, we decided that a sushi making cookery class would be a great way of learning how to bring some of our experiences home with us! Ayuko-san, who runs the class, was a charming, knowledgable and helpful teacher and made us feel right at home. The whole experience was fantastic from beginning to end!! Her little studio is charming and atmospheric. She is a very good teacher, giving you clear instructions and always happy to lend a helping hand, yet able to step back to let you get on with it, when you just need that bit of extra time to figureit out for yourself. Our children absolutely love sushi and were so proud to have made it themselves! I was impressed that she allowed them to handle massive knives for cutting the sushi. it was so nice to see someone treating children like they can be responsible and competent, instead of 'baby-ing' them. She was also happy to answer our many questions regarding ettiquette and manners. At the end of the class she spent ages pouring over our Tokyo map to point out sights of interest to us and how to get there. Booking and payment from England was really easy and convenient using paypal and Ayuko-san was happy to meet our dietary requirements (halal) without any fuss! She always answered our emails promptly, sometimes within minutes, I can happily say that the class was one of the highlights of our amazing Japan trip and we would highly recommend it to anyone as it is a fun way of learning new skills and learning about Japanese culture from a Japanese person, whose English is excellent. if we ever come back to Tokyo, we will definitely look you up again!!!

So we looked up the possibility for a sushi class in Tokyo and found out about Buddha Bellies Cooking School.Let me just sum up our experience to avoid a repetition what has been already written by other travellers:The whole experience (from the moment of our first contact via email, to payment, detailed information and directions and then the course itself in a very welcoming, warm and enjoyable atmosphere) was simply superb and outstanding, as the instructor/chef Ayuko is incredibly knowledgable and has a great passion for cooking and teaching. Her English, and instruction, is excellent.We will surely be back for more classes as there is no better way to experience Japan and its foodie culture. The only thing that is left to write is that we highly recommend Buddha Bellies Cooking School!!!"

We were greeted on the dot of 11:00 am by a young lady with a huge smile - this was Ayuko our instructor. Her prep work for the class was perfect and she was so knowledgeable in her art. She patiently explained and listened and made the class feel at ease. It was like sitting around with an International array of friends and enjoying and learning. Ayuko taught us important techniques and history of Japanese cooking. We highly recommend this class to any and everyone. Guys, don't be hesitant to accompany your partners to this class. You will really regret it if you don't go. You will have a fun time, learn some bonus and valuable stuff and get to eat some good food - the food you cooked and drink some good Beer/Sake. Get a hold of Ayuko and take one or more classes. We plan to do so on our next visit in the near future."

Ayuko sent us very detailed directions for which subway to take, stop to get off and exit to use for the meeting point. We were greeted warmly by Ayuko walked to her school, steps away from the train station. My husband and I took the Sushi class, along with 3 fellow travelers and food enthusiasts. While the rice finished cooking Ayuko shared some of the traditions of the tea ceremony with us, as we made our own cup of tea. Once the rice was ready our sushi lesson began, history and how to...a perfect blend. Ayuko has a wealth of knowledge and is a patient teacher. The quality of the fish we used in our sushi was fresh and wonderful. After we were done with our lesson...we of course got to eat what we made...with Sake, Japanese style, which Ayuko helped us enjoy!Great experience, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a hands on taste of Tokyo."

We were very excited to learn how to make chicken teriyaki and egg roll - and have since bought an egg roll pan (which we're using tonight). Ayuko is a marvelous teacher - she is patient, calm and kind and gave great instruction. The class is an interactive one but easy to accomplish and a lot of fun.Like someone else mentioned the venue is a lovely surprise and keeping the class small meant we could all chat amongst ourselves, laugh and have a great time.We had a bit of trouble finding the A2 exit - my top tip is that it's across the road (at street level) from the A1 exit.Taking a class here really is the ultimate souvineer of your trip if you love Japanese food.

We found booking many activities over the Christmas and New Years period in Japan to be a difficult task, many activities, museums and other attractions close down for a well earned break, I started to worry that we should have picked a different time of the year to travel! However, what we did find was a series of activities and attractions that you might call \"off the beaten track\" in so far as we found all the hidden gems!We are all crazy about Japanese food and cooking in general, so we started the hunt for a good cooking class in the Tokyo area. From our first email to our final goodbye and beyond, Buddha Bellies was an experience not to be missed. We chose to do the bento class so we could try our hands at a variety of dishes. Our host, Ayuko, was just a delight. Ayuko is a natural instructor, who gave us a great appreciation for what we were preparing and explained the cultural relevance of different ingredients and taught us how to prepare a number of dishes that, without hands-on instruction, seem an impossible feat (think tamagoyaki). We attended the class the morning after we arrived in Japan and it was a wonderful introduction to Japanese culture, food and lifestyle. Our group of three was complemented by another lovely tourist and by the end of the class we were all chatting and laughing like old friends. Ayuko provides a comfortable and relaxed environment, while at the same time her excellent communication skills made us all feel like we had taken away a great deal from the class.Accessing the venue was very straightforward but I don't want to divulge much more about the venue and atmosphere, we knew nothing before we arrived and it was such a lovely surprise when we got there that I would hate to spoil it for anyone else!The fee was exceptionally reasonable, we all agreed that the price of the class was insignificant when compared to the value we received.I would recommend this class to families, couples, friends and individuals- so anyone really!"

Through an online search I was able to find Buddha Bellies and read all of the good reviews on Trip Advisor. My husband and I decided on the sushi making class and I e-mailed the instructor to coordinate a day. We were able to make reservations and pay through pay pal. She confirmed the reservation and gave us instructions on where and when to meet her.We were staying near Tokyo station so took the subway to the meeting point at Jimbocho station (there was no Japan Rail stop near by for those with JR Passes). We got there kind of early to be safe and there wasn't too much near by but the instructor, Ayuko, showed up at the meeting point a little early and everyone was already there. The class is done in a very casual atmosphere in I guess a studio right next to the train station. There were 5 others with us (3 folks from Australia, 2 from the UK). We got to make both fancy rolls and nigiri sushi. Ayuko spoke perfect English and gave us all of the tools to make sushi, showing us step by step what to do. The fish quality was great and the sushi was delicious. She also gave us green tea in the beginning and then saki or beer when we ate. All-in-all the experience was great and I loved doing it. She answered all of our questions and both my husband and I had a ton of fun."

Fish cutting involved preparing a fish from the whole fish down to pieces of sashimi.

We had a great time with Ayuko, a very warm, patient and friendly host who taught us the basics of sushi making and helped us turn out a very impressive sushi plate.In a small, warmly-lit room (bookshop by day), our group - including my 10 and 12 year old boys - turned our hands to 2 types of sushi and the 2 hours just flew by. We enjoyed our own creations and each other's company with a glass of beer, sake or green tea.On a practical level, Buddha Bellies is a super-easy commute along several subway lines and the school is right next door to Jimbocho Station.

I am a fairly advanced home cook but I definitely learned a few tricks that I didn't know and would have been difficult to pick up from a book. I won't say what they are because you should take the class if you are interested!"

We got to learn a little origami and making the soup as accompaniment. And she did gave a surprise at the end, after having a full belly of our handiwork.

Ayuko explained the details of the ingredients we used, which shops we should visit to get them, also told us what else we could use in case we won't find the same item.The class was attended by some Japanese ladies (including me) and some non-Japanese people who were staying in Tokyo for business, all of us with different background.

Once you have tasted it fresh, you\u00b4re hooked. But don\u00b4t let this stop you, it\u00b4s really a great thing to do when you\u00b4re in Tokyo!"

I was planning to open a Japanese restaurant in my country thus wanting to take an intensive cooking course to learn about Japanese cuisine. I was very lucky to have found the amazing teacher, Ayuko who is also the owner of Buddha Bellies Cooking School.It is not easy at all to find a teacher who can speak good English in Japan but Ayuka speaks English perfectly. She makes all the cooking classes very interesting; especially, she makes all the recipes so easy to learn, prepare and cook.I was amazed about her garnishing skills, her magic hands can turn all into art. I was lucky enough to take private classes where I have learned everything from scratch and learned a lot from her.Besides, Ayuko is extremely helpful; she spent her own time to show me around different supermarkets and introduce to me a variety of Japanese ingredients, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish etc. She was also kind and knowledgeable enough to recommend me many interesting restaurants where I was taken to the real world of Japanese gastronomy.I was absolutely touched that she even helped me organize my accommodation in Japan and even picked me up and sent me to the private cooking class on my first day. This is very helpful as you can easily get lost in Tokyo where Japanese language seems to be the only communication.I completed about 30 dishes and I am very happy that these can be on the menu for my up-coming restaurant.Honestly, I can\u2019t express how wonderful it was to learn with Ayuko - it was all fabulous and she is definitely such the loveliest and most awesome person I have ever met.She has made my my trip a complete.My huge thank to Ayuko and I do hope to come back for more cooking classes.Last but not least, Buddha Bellies Cooking School is a must do in Tokyo.Anthony H"

I was living in Tokyo for a year and found it difficult to find a class in English that was interesting and where I was able to learn skills I could use when I moved back home. I did three classes with Ayuko - bento, sushi and nabe. I highly recommend all of these classes. Particularly the Nabe class - a great winter dish and easy to make once you learn how to! Ayuko is also extremely friendly, her English is excellent and she has some interesting history on each dish. The class sizes are also small (max of 4 people) which makes it more personal."

I took my boyfriend for a vegetarian sushi class at Buddha Bellies Cooking School for his birthday. After reading on the website that there were only weekday classes, I was a little worried that we would not be able to go, as my boyfriend works full time. However, Ayuko very kindly offered to hold a class on Sunday for us, which was a great relief, and very lovely of her!The class itself was really good fun. Ayuko was both knowledgeable and patient, and I felt that I learned some really interesting inside info on the sushi world. Take-away recipe sheets were thoughtfully provided for us to try out our newly-acquired techniques at a later date. It was lovely to take part in a mini tea ceremony as well, really gave a flavour of Japanese culture and cuisine.With Ayuko's help, I couldn't believe my finished product looked so good! And tasted even better... Thanks so much for a lovely time."

This time, I decided to take a small group cooking class and I found Ayuko's class from Trip Advisor. The class was conducted in a library room with chic New York design and full of Japanese culture books. We made teriyaki chicken and soba noodles (from scratch)! Ayuko speaks very good English and it was interesting for us to learn the different procedures while chatting with her the day to day life style of local Japanese. I have eaten teriyaki chicken and soba noodles before but never really appreciate them that much. After all the cutting, stepping on the dough, rolling the noodle machines, etc, these two dishes have a new meaning to me. Home made soba is the best! The highlight of the class was to enjoy the finished dishes with other classmates and Ayuko, over some Japanese beer/ sake and lots of laughter. I would strongly recommend anyone who enjoys Japanese food and culture to join this class!"

From the first email to her final send-off (with a small gift and some great restaurant recommendations), Ayuko-san was a joy to work with. Her explanations for the various dishes we prepared were clear and easy to follow and she showed us some techniques for home-style Japanese dishes that I am looking forward to applying in my own kitchen here in Japan. While the work space for the class is small, the number of participants is deliberately kept low, meaning we weren't always bumping into each other and had plenty of room to work. The best part of the class was, of course, eating the final product. I had a wonderful experience and would certainly consider returning to take one of her other courses."

This class was right up our alley. We chose the udon class and it was a great experience. I'm 3rd generation japanese and have never liked udon (at least the udon we get in the states) but Ayuko did a fabulous job changing my mind. She made the class fun and engaging and made sure we had all the info we needed to recreate the dishes at home. The cooking room was beautiful and had lots of great books on Japan and japanese cooking. Ayuko even answered some of our sillier questions about japanese culture and superstitions that we were dying to ask. Highly recommended. My wife and I will be back to Japan and to her sushi class as soon as we can."

So we booked a lesson and were enjoying 2.5 hours introduction to Japanese Udon cooking as well as other interesting information on Japanese cooking. Ayuko is a great teacher and we liked the nice atmosphere with all the books surrounding us. Time was flying and the self-made Udon and Teriyaki Chicken tasted very good. All in all I would definitely recommend this school to anyone looking for an introduction to cooking some of the most popular and well-known Japanese dishes."

            "review": "Demystifying Japanese Home Cooking. I'm a big fan of Japanese cuisine. Although I cook regularly, I've never attempted Japanese staple dishes because the cuisine's techniques, ingredients, and cooking ware seem to be in a world of their own. So, when I had a free day during my visit to Tokyo last week, I thought I would take a cooking class. The choices for English-speaking, Japanese cuisine cooking classes in Tokyo are pretty limited (at least from my online search). I found a few specialized schools for soba or sushi-making but are mostly catered to professionals and priced as such. While a couple of others mostly featured international cuisine. I think Buddha Bellies fills a niche that you can't really find in Tokyo for approachable instruction and introduction to basic Japanese dishes.I had a great experience with Ayuko, who runs Buddha Bellies. From start to end, Ayuko was very attentive and accommodated every need. I had emailed Ayuko with rather short notice to inquire about fitting me into a course with 1-day schedule. Not only was Ayuko really prompt with her responses, she offered to hold a private Bento Box lesson for me since I couldn't make a group class. During the lesson, Ayuko provided a clear overview and went through the steps in detail for each dish I was going to make. I was pleasantly surprised how hands-on it was with Ayuko watching by my side and on occasion taking over to show me an alternate way of doing something. The most endearing part of the lesson was when Ayuko switched to instruct me in Japanese after she found out, through our conversation, that I was currently studying the language and had very little opportunity to speak it where I lived. I really appreciated the thoughtfulness and patience! Overall, I found the lesson very insightful with good tips that I've incorporated in my attempt at Japanese cooking at home. Besides the lesson, Ayuko shared cultural insights (including how to make, serve, and drink matcha) as well as shopping recommendations for good quality food products and cooking ware (from a foodie/local's perspective). Finally, the place where the class was held (in a personal library of English books on anything Japanese) was such a treat. It truly felt like you were learning to cook in a friend's home.I'll be back soon and have convinced my boyfriend to join me in the next class!"

So when I found out we would be moving to the Tokyo area, I immediately began researching potential cooking schools...and I can say that I am so glad that I found this school!We did a group class for making homemade udon. Udon has long been a favorite but it was interesting to finally see how it's made and hear some of the history behind it. We were with several other couples so it a fun social event as well. After preparing the udon, the instructor Ayu provided us with a traditional appetizer plate that we each put together in traditional Japanese-style. There was instruction, laughter, \"udon dancing\" and more!The instructor Ayu is incredibly knowledgable and has a great passion for cooking and teaching. Her English, and instruction, is excellent. She keeps everyone on time (even reminded us that we needed to catch the train in order to make it home before they stopped!) but in a relaxed atmosphere that feels like you're at home. After the class, she even sent us a few pictures so we could remember our time making udon. My in-laws are coming to visit soon and I'm already planning to add a private cooking class to their schedule. There's no better way to experience Japan and its foodie culture!"

My husband and I visited Tokyo in November and as avid foodies were keen to learn how to cook and prepare some traditional Japanese dishes during our stay. As we are both vegetarian, Buddha Bellies tailored a lesson of authentic recipes free from any meat or fish products specifically for us. Our teacher Ayu, who is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic, provided us with copious notes and clear instructions for each dish. Her genuine passion for food made the class a lot of fun as well as informative. By the end of the session, we had produced an impressive platter of vegetarian sushi and teriyaki tofu (delicious!). After cooking the dishes we were then able to enjoy them with some lovely sake, while perusing the shelves of books on all aspects of Japanese culture that lined the studio. Buddha Bellies is a culinary gem in the centre of Tokyo and was definitely one of the main highlights of our trip to Japan. We hope to return again in the future and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about Japanese cooking and having a wonderful time while doing so."

I would recommend this experience for 'foodies' or for people wanting to really experience more about Japanese culture.

Mariko's Culture Experience allowed us to experience calligraphy, origami, furoshiki and sushi making in one sitting. Additionally, the experience allowed us to talk with a local, and ask all our questions on daily Japanese life. The experience was definitely worth it, and definitely was one of the highlights of our trip."

After playing tourist with all the sight seeing and hectic subway rides it was really nice to join Mariko for the day in her home and learn about several Japanese arts. Mariko met us at the train station and from that point on it felt like I was visiting with a friend. She took us into her home where we spent time with her mom and daughter. It was so nice to be in a home and treated so warmly while being educated about the culture. Mariko speaks great English and is a wonderful teacher. The food that we helped prepare was excellent. Mariko's mom cooked for a restaurant and the taste proves it. Make sure you do this when in Tokyo."

I loved it and find myself showing off my origami skills to anyone who will pay attention. The best part was the attention to detail and the opportunity to ask questions. I have practiced making gyoza since I came back as well. Now, I should add that my favorite meal (of all meals) is Chicken Katsu Curry and when I mentioned my failed efforts at finding the perfect and particular spice that is in use to make the curry sauce, Mariko answered that question and then took a step further. She showed me the spice, provided it as gift and delivered in email the directions in how to make it. Wow! Now every time I make the curry sauce following the provided instructions I think of this experience with a giant grin on my face.This experience really meant a lot to me. My brother and I had a great time. I recommend this experience to anyone and everyone.Thank you again to everyone involved!!!"

I forgot to mention to Yoshimi that I had food allergies and one of the key ingredients had shellfish in it which I could not eat. This was no problem as she was quickly able to make an adjustment to the menu on the fly for me. A testament to her cooking skills and it was still delicious! I can't wait to apply what I have learned from her class into my kitchen back home. The lesson comes with a printed cultural guide and recipe cards so you won't forget what you have learned.

Take a pen and notebook and note down any tips that you find useful.Lots of classmates took photos on phones as the class progressed and Yoshimi ok with that.At end of cooking class we all sat down and enjoyed the cooked meal - which was substantial. Recipe was handed out at end of class.The event took 1/2 day and was very worthwhile. I went on my own but there was a couple there too and other singles.I feel confident now in cooking Tempura.

Seeing how produce differs in terms of size and flavor, what combinations you utilize, and what techniques are more common to the Japanese kitchen was fascinating. The small class size lends itself to a friendliness and camaraderie among the students culminating in a beautiful homemade meal overlooking a river.

The class is hands on with explanation every step of the way. The best part is we got to eat the full meal when we were done. I can't wait to get home and try what I learned. The video she does is a great recap of the day if you forget to take pictures. So much fun, I came back the next day for another class!"

Yoshimi, our teacher had excellent english and a high level of detail which showed through in how she presented information in the class. One very interesting part of the class was a chart she presented which outlined how Japanese has many more words for textures then english does. These sort of details about Japanese food and cooking really helped me appreciate the food during the rest of our trip in Japan."

We met Yoshimi in Asakusa near a major tourist landmark and she walked us to her beautiful, sparkling kitchen space overlooking the river. She gave us a brief background about Japanese cooking: flavors, ingredients, philosophies then we got to cooking. My husband and I were the only students that day. We learned how to make maki sushi, potato miso soup and two very simple sides: a chilled tofu and seasoned spinach dish. Yoshimi is knowledgeable, skilled and encouraging. She also speaks excellent English, honestly the best English I heard during two weeks in Japan. I'm an experienced home cook, but my husband is not as comfortable in the kitchen. She got us both equally involved and made the whole experience really fun and informative. Yoshimi is a delight and just a lovely person. At the end, we got to enjoy all the dishes we made. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Highly recommend. I can't wait to come back and take another class with her."

I thought learning how to cook Japanese food would be a great way to do this. Yoshimi's Tokyo Kitchen had interesting options, a good price, and I was able to book it the day before. Yoshimi met me at Kaminarimon, the famous landmark gate in Asakusa. From there, it was a short walk to her house. She is very responsive to questions, helpful, and was interested in hearing about my trip around Japan. There is also a great view of the river and the Asahi building! In the spring, you can see cherry blossom trees from her window. Before the cooking began, Yoshimi went over the basics of Japanese cooking, which I'd never learned before. It was very interesting. Then, we started cooking. We made a tofu dish, a spinach salad, and tempura - but she has multiple classes, including one that sounds great where you make shapes of animals like bunnies and teddy bears on sushi rolls. Yoshimi is a great teacher and this was a wonderful addition to my trip!"

Yoshimi talked us through what we were doing and did some of the more complex things while we helped with chopping and mixing (at one point trying to fan rice with one hand and mix with the other - that didn't go well for clumsy ol' me!) Yoshimi is a great teacher, and treated us with great patience and humour, and the end result showed this - it all looked and tasted great!Highly recommended for anyone who likes a bit of a challenge, a bit of learning and an appetite for tasty food."

We decided to book very early in our trip when we knew we would be jet lagged, but we managed to stay awake for our dinner class! We learned so much and the food was wonderful!! I highly recommend doing this early in your trip, since we learned so much and had a deeper understanding of the Japanese cuisine and customs during the rest of our trip. Since returning home, I have managed to cook our meal during two busy weeknights! I'm amazed at how easy it is for me to prepare an authentic Japanese rice dish/bowl with ease!"

First, the location and facilities - I was met by the lovely Yoshimi at Kaminarimon and we walked a short way along the river to the kitchen. Along the way we passed the Tokyo Sky Tree and Asahi HQ. The kitchen itself is spacious and bright, spotless, super well organized and has great views of the river. But what about the class? It was so informative, I learned so much! I loved the pre-cooking section where Yoshimi discussed Japanese foods, key ingredients, the thinking behind good meals, etiquette, etc. She is very organized and takes you through it clearly, with notes provided to take away with you. Then to the cooking - we made pork katsu curry, miso soup, rice and 2 side dishes. All along, Yoshimi taught interesting ways of cleaning, chopping, flavoring, and the reasons why, etc. She's just as organized in the kitchen and everything comes together nicely. And the food! So delicious! And, importantly, I actually feel like I could recreate the meal at home.Yoshimi is calm, knowledgable, enthusiastic, funny, a wonderful host and teacher. If you are looking for a cooking class in Tokyo, this is the one to book. I know next time I'm in Tokyo I'll be checking the menus for another class with Yoshimi."

I booked this cooking class with the Backstreet Guide tour, and it was an exceptional day. Actually, I wish Yoshimi offered her classes and tour on Mondays, because it was a very helpful, and it would've been a great introduction to Tokyo/Japan. I learned so much about Tokyo, and the Japanese. The cooking class itself was well-organized, fun, practical, and easy to follow. We started out with a small intro to Japanese cuisine and table manners (I can't say it enough, but I totally wish this was the first thing I did in Tokyo!!). Then, we started cooking. She taught us how to cook rice, miso soup, chilled tofu, spinach, and katsu curry. The food was delicious, and she gave us recipe cards so that we can replicate what we learned. The tour itself was so much fun!! I had the opportunity to see a kombu shop, we went to a supermarket, Ameyoko market, and Mitsukoshi Department store. I was fortunate enough to have the tour all to myself, so I asked a lot of questions, and Yoshimi was so patient and helpful. She answered all my questions, not just about food, but Japan in general. All this, I might add, despite a raging typhoon pouring gallons of rain over our heads. Yoshimi's daughter, Lynn, spent the day with us because schools were closed in preparation for the typhoon. She was the most well-behaved and polite little girl, and she kept up with the adults in all the heavy rain - a real trooper! the class, plus the tour truly offered a range of experiences, from simple home cooking to more gourmet offerings Tokyo has to offer. It's definitely a must-try experience!"

Also, there is a great view!2) replicable recipes- you could make these recipes on your own again!3) gluten free- she can accommodate visitors with gluten allergies.

After being picked up at the police station in front of the Kaminarimon Gate, we walked to a cooking studio, where we learned about the elements that make up Japanese food. Then, we prepared and ate a delicious meal, including a wonderful tempura! I highly recommend the class and hope to take another one the next time I visit Tokyo."

I took the mosaic sushi class which also included several other side dish recipes that I look forward to making when I get home. The class also included a lesson on Japanese cooking basics (seasonality, seasonings and texture) and some handy info on table manners. Yoshimi is lovely, welcoming, speaks great English and happily answered any other questions I had about Japan. I would definitely recommend taking a class."

We found out so much about Japanese cuisine as well as their history, mentality and tradition. It is not easy to find English speaking people in Japan, but Yoshimi is perfectly fluent. Enjoyed some great food and learned how to cook it ourselves. We brought back all the ingredients and now have a valuable addition to our family cooking book. This is a must for every food lover in Tokyo :)"

She is very organized in presenting her material so her students can get a better understanding of nutritious balances, ingredients of Japanese cuisines, health benefits and Japanese dining etiquettes.I really enjoyed making nikujaga, tofu salad, miso potato soup and sesame spinach in class. It was definitely a treat to have homemade lunch overlooking beautiful Sumida river! If you have a chance to go to Tokyo, I definitely recommend this class.

I think that I surprised her because I have actually been a Tokyo resident for many years and didn't know how to cook some of the basic dishes. Yoshimi was very knowledgeable and incredibly organized. She first goes over the basics of Japanese food including tastes, textures, and basic composition and then the fun moves into the kitchen. Yoshimi clearly has a lot of experience with preparing traditional Japanese food, and I especially enjoyed making sushi rolls for the first time and learning how to make the perfect rice to go with it. Thank you very much, Yoshimi-san! I look forward to learning more from you again very soon. I just bought more ingredients :)"

My boyfriend and I decided to take a cooking class while we were in Tokyo and after doing some research (via TripAdvisor) we decided to contact Tokyo Kitchen (Yoshimi) and make a reservation for a class we were interested in. But: oh no! The class we wanted was the next day, and it was already late! Yoshimi got back to us very quickly and told us it was okay, and we were so relieved. N.B. - We speak zero to no Japanese. Yoshimi speaks perfect English. Way to go, Yoshimi. Boo on us. Yoshimi's directions on where to meet her were clear, and she was there a little before the appointed time (like us!) and from there she walked us to the kitchen... it is a cosy apartment on the waterfront with a beautiful view of the river and the Asahi building across the way. Yoshimi's introduction to Japanese cuisine was so helpful, and she answered any questions we had with ease! After that, we got to cookin' .... Bento! The amount of preparation and care that went into the lesson was apparent at every turn (Yoshimi had already done some of the prep work). We learned how to make egg omelette, but ours didn't turn out so well. I mean, there's 'barely competent', and then there's 'what we produced' --- which by no means was a reflection of Yoshimi. By the time our lesson was over we had made Inari Sushi (making the sushi rice and tofu pockets), a spinach side (in amaaaazing sesame sauce), Chilled tofu (with a Japanese ginger, onion and tomato topping), Miso soup (from-scratch dashi!), and a number of little bento box garnishes (cheese and seaweed, ham flowers, and omelette hearts). Eating and talking with Yoshimi was perhaps the best part - we got to pick her brain about different social and cultural Japanese issues. Our conversation ranged from graveyards (we brought it up because we had walked through a graveyard the day before) to the different neighborhoods of Tokyo and their mascots.When it was time to go we were so sad because we had such fun with Yoshimi. She is a delight in every way, and if you are traveling to Tokyo (or are already here and want to brush up on some skills) we couldn't recommend Yoshimi highly enough. Not only were we full at the end of the three hours we spent with her, but we took home recipe cards and some information on Japanese cuisine. To Yoshimi all we can say is: \uff4d\uff08\uff0e\uff3f\uff0e\uff09\uff4d\u30a2\u30ea\u30ac\u30c8!!!!TLDR: DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!"

Cooking classes are a wonderful way to immerse yourself in the real customs of the country awhile sampling delicious local cuisines. We\u2019ve been to the Cordon Bleu in Paris, classes in New Orleans, and many other places, but this experience in Tokyo Kitchen was by far my favorite!What makes this class outstanding:100% hands-on from the start! You put on aprons and Yoshi puts you to work! Unlike many other cooking classes where we played a passive role (occasionally chopping or prepping), we made our own dishes, under Yoshi\u2019s tutelage.Yoshi met us at a central location and we walked to her kitchen together.Before cooking, Yoshi treated us to a culinary and cultural lesson (everything from proper chopstick etiquette to the Japanese words for different food textures. This really made us feel as if we understood not only the food, but the delicious culture surrounding the food and customs.The class can be customized and scaled. We were on a business trip with several others form America and Canada. We ended up being an intimate party of 3, but Yoshi remained flexible. Yoshi was informative, and we kept the class on schedule (we were meeting others in our party at an assigned time after the class) but she took the time to answer questions and go on tangents when needed!Highly recommended!!"

She met us at the Asakusa shrine gate for a five minute walk to her kitchen. All was laid out and ready for a classic menu: miso soup, chilled tofu, spinach and tonkatsu in curry on rice. We managed the whole thing, including dining time, in about two hours, an accelerated pace that accommodated my flight time. The instructions were simple and beautifully demonstrated, allowing us to follow easily in the prep of the meal. Technique was straightforward and would all be easily replicated at home (as I've since proven, following my return). For me, the most instructive part of the class was in the handling of unfamiliar ingredients. It all turns out to be very easy. Mishimi-san is a wonderful teacher, moving smoothly through the courses and prep steps but making sure we were following. She is a fount of knowledge on Japanese cuisine and begins the class with a brief intro on the basics of Japanese food culture. Her English is very good. This is a great value, a strong lesson and lots of fun. Highest recommendation."

You can read my review on my blog. http://www.bestlivingjapan.com/tokyo-kitchen-japanese-cooking-class/The other day I took the Tonkatsu Curry (fried pork chop and curry) class at Tokyo Kitchen in Asakusa. One of my personal goals, this year is to learn how to cook Japanese food proper. To find the right school for me I tried out Tokyo Kitchen. Yoshimi, owner and sensei, met me in front of the Kaninari -Mon (big red gate) at Senso-ji (Senso Temple) in Asakusa. She was easy to spot dressed elegantly in a kimono. We walked about 3-5 mins to her cooking studio on the Sumida River. I think Yoshimi gets the award for best cooking class view. The view must be gorgeous when the cherry blossoms are in bloom. The cooking studio is comprised of two rooms a kitchen and dining room that are newly renovated, bright and well equipped. The place is spotless since Yoshimi just started her business in August 2014. I was the only student for my lesson that was great for me (maybe not good for Yoshimi). Yoshimi began the lesson by teaching me about the basics of Japanese seasonings and flavours, table manner and an overview what and how we were going to cook. You can tell Yoshimi's background is in consumer products purchasing and marketing because her printed materials and explanations are excellent.The main dish was Katsu-curry, but I also learned three side dishes. Love all of them, as my family did as well. The side dishes included 1. blanched spinach with sesame dressing, 2. tofu with tomato, ginger and onion topping and 3. potato miso soup. That meant we needed to actually cook curry, rice, katsu (pork cutlet) and three side dishes! Despite the diversity of dishes, Yoshimi was able to walk me through each step of each dish quite well. I have since reproduced this menu twice at home with good reviews from my tribe. I also learned some tricks of the trade such adding garlic or a piece of chocolate to curry, draining tofu for 30 mins before making salad and chopping katsu, not slicing. After cooking, we sat down together and enjoyed a wonderful lunch with hot tea and green tea ice-cream.I really enjoyed my lesson with Yoshimi and think she will build a great business for herself. All she needs is more students. Support this young mother who is trying to make her dream come true! She even made a short video of our day together and has it on her website.Tokyo Kitchen also has special menus for private lessons, offers a 1/2 day cooking and 1/2 day tour in Asakusa, and offers a Kimono dressing class for women!Differentiators: Beautiful view of Sumida river, the wide variety of classes, instruction into flavours and manners, very useful recipe cards to take home, and received a gift of drink coasters.Possible improvements: Needed to stand the entire lesson (ok, for me but not everyone). Kitchen areas may be a bit tight for more than four people, but additional dining area could be used. Pricing might need to be adjusted per menu (all the same set price now)."

Despite very little cooking experience and thanks to Yoshimi's patience and kindness, I learnt not only to make sushi but also miso soup and different side dishes. Yoshimi also gives a lot of advices and cooking tips as well as a thorough history of traditional Japanese food. I had a lovely time and learnt so much! A highlight of my time in Tokyo!"

I love Japanese food but I have celiac disease,which makes it very difficult to eat out. On top of that my partner is vegetarian. Yoshimi carefully went through her menu with me and found gluten-free soy sauce and miso paste, and we made a tasty selection of sushi with miso soup and two side dishes. Everything about the class was just brilliant, from insights into Japanese food culture to the delicious meal.Thankyou again Yoshimi! We are looking forward to making the dishes again at home! :)"

After visiting Japan numerous times, I was keen to do a cooking class this time round something that's a little bit different - the ease of online booking and convenient location decided it for me and I made a day of it in Asakusa. Yoshimi met me right on time and it was a quick 5mins walk to the apartment. I did the tempura main dish and it was really not that difficult, Yoshimi is so friendly and very patient in answering my questions - I learnt about the Japanese \"ginger\" and also bought the bonito flakes and konbu from a nearby supermarket. The lunch was enjoyable on what was a crisp early winter day and a bonus, Yoshimi shared some restaurant recommendations for places I was going to visit. I plan to replicate the meal for my family this holiday season and will certainly try do another course next time in Tokyo. I also liked the homecooking style is authentic and achievable; recipe cards are fantastic, very handy in the kitchen. If you have a morning to spare, definitely recommend a unique experience."

She is a very warm and relaxed person who showed us her love of Japanese cooking and Japanese culture. She met us on time at the meeting place and took us back to the cooking studio/apartment in Asakusa. We prepared a delicious meal of tempura, tofu, spinach, rice with a green tea ice cream treat for dessert. Yoshimi is very organised and explained all of her procedures and recipes clearly. She also talked about Japanese culture and eating, which we found really interesting. Our afternoon saw us visit the Imperial Palace, a food market and department store food floor, which was fun to learn about all the different foods and preparations. We had some great laughs and really enjoyed the company of Yoshimi. I would highly recommend this tour for a full packed day of interesting hands on activities, lots of useful knowledge on Japan and good company."

My two friends and I had a great time learning how to cook the tempura main dish as well as a couple of side dishes. The food was delicious and Yoshimi was great company. A real highlight of the class was spending some time talking after lunch about the differences between our cultures - Yoshimi was surprised to learn about the Australian custom of a beer fridge!! It was also great to be able to take away recipe cards. I would definitely recommend taking the class early in the trip as Yoshimi taught us etiquette basics as well as important information about the composition and significance of Japanese food.

First class greating by a real lady who will go through the Japanese way towards food that is all about respect for the best. Then you go to the learning by doing phase with all explanations of why's and how with the basic techniques that apply to all fundamentals. The \"teacher\" masters her knowhow, explains it so well that you really get into it and in a nice kitchen with a great view on the river,you learn exactly what needs to ne done. All the tricks are revealed and the teaching is in a perfect English. You cut, cook, fry, etc.... in a learn by doing process and when it's all ready you eat the meals that have been prepared and continue sharing. This was the best experience an absolute MUST. And when you're back on the streets again, you not only learned how to prepare the best food in the world but you say to yourself that you have met one of the top persons you will meet during your life. I will never forget this and only rencourage all types of visiter to join her next classes. Thanks again and I can't wait to be back home to apply all I've learned."

Towards the end of our three week trip to Japan we decided to take part in Yoshimi's cooking class in Tokyo - we wish we had done it earlier!! Using Yoshimi's website to make our booking was extremely straightforward and she was really helpful in explaining what we could cook and accommodated our request to cook tonkatsu. Meeting Yoshimi was easy - clear instructions on time and place of the meeting point are sent via email upon booking. As a tourist in Japan having the planning done for you is so helpful, thank you!The location of Yoshimi's kitchen is perfect - a short, lovely walk to a great spot over looking the river and the Sky Tower. The class started with an introduction to Japanese cooking and food etiquette including correct use of chopsticks - we realised we had made a lot of mistakes in the first two weeks of our trip!The cooking experience was great. Yoshimi was very inclusive and made sure we understood every step of the recipe and explained why we were using certain ingredients and techniques for the meal we were creating. We had so much fun and the food was delicious - worth every penny. I would highly recommend Tokyo Kitchen and based on the quick lesson at the beginning around food etiquette in Japan I would recommend you do this class early on in your trip so that you don't use your chopsticks to stab your food :-) Thanks Yoshimi!"

Mayuko is a doll and is also a terrific cook and teacher. I can barely boil and egg, but by the end of the session we had a really nice lunch cooked by me (and mostly my wife and the other couple). She supplied the ingredients and the instruction and we did the rest. Besides cooking, she also spent time talking about Japanese culture and made us feel like long time friends. When I go back to Japan, I am going to book this again. Well worth the time."

Her home is in a very quiet and peaceful area even though being in the middle of Tokyo. In her cosy little kitchen, she started with explaining us some basic concepts of Japanese cooking. Her English is perfect. Then, we cut all the ingredients for teriyaki chicken, miso potatoes, cucumber salad and miso soup and started cooking. Mayuko explained everything in a very understandable way, flavoured with a pinch of humor, and we are positive that we can cook this delicious meal at home without big accidents. Before eating, she explained us how to arrange the food in little \u201cmountains\u201d on the plates because with the mountain-form, you can be sure that nobody pinched from your plate while you were not watching ;-) Finally, we were ready for the first bite and it was YUMMY!"

She offers the classes in her own house, which naturally creates a very cozy atmosphere. She makes you feel at ease right away. In excellent English, Mayuko patiently explained the basic ingredients and cooking techniques, as well as the customs associated with the meal. She is both an excellent cook and a very knowledgeable person. Throughout the course, we merrily chattered away on a broad range of topics. She even recommended some good restaurants to go, which led to another memorable experience (but that's another review). In all, if you happen to be in Tokyo, do not pass on the opportunity to visit Mayuko."

We travel regularly and a major reason is we love trying different foods, so we try to do a cooking class in every country we go to. Mayuko's is by far the best we've done anywhere. She is a lovely, bubbly person who just makes you want to smile.Mayuko welcomed us at the train station and we took a quick stroll to her apartment. It was so lovely to be invited into her home. No question was a stupid one and we learnt some much about the customs in japan.We cooked chicken karaage (Yummy Japanese Fried Chicken which we love) two side dishes and miso soup. I loved learning to make Dashi and alsoloved learning about the different type of miso.Mayuko also gave us some tips on where to go and wrote down some instructions on how to get there.This is so much more than a cooking class, it's a must do when you're in Toyko!"

She gives you all the information needed as far as where to meet.The class itself was amazing. She goes through and not only explains the dish you will make, but also goes into detail about what each ingredient is and why it is used in Japanese cooking. She provides everything, from her cozy and lovely apartment to the music of your choice! The atmosphere is perfect. You will undoubtedly learn some great tips and tricks as we did, and if you are lucky to have others in your class, you will meet some amazing new people from around the world!I highly recommend this experience to anyone visiting Tokyo looking for something which will teach them about Japan and its culture.

We were met at Mayuko's nearby station and took the brief walk to her home, where we spent the next 2.5 hours learning about some of the staples of Japanese cooking - sushi, miso and Meal presentation. But this class is so much more. Because you are in a real home you are presented with how hospitality is managed and what some of the customs mean. Everyone has an opportunity to be hands on with both preparation and presentation and then at the end, you share a meal with your new friends. Mayuko is warm and generous, knowing both how to teach and how to host. Her generosity with information and ingredients was absolutely a stand out aspect of this class. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to find out where to begin with Japanese cooking and also eating. Definitely one of the most worthwhile activities of our two weeks in Japan."

Mayuko's Little Kitchen cooking class helped fill some of these holes and I now feel like I understand Japanese cuisine much better, and I will try making it at home again. For our class, we made gyoza, cucumber seaweed and sesame salad, miso soup and kabochano squash. All of the dishes were very simple to prepare, but incredibly flavorful. After I finish writing this review, I'm going to make some miso soup :) When I visit Tokyo again I will definitely take another class with Mayuko."

Everything was delicious and we all were able to help make the dishes (and some of the best miso soup we've had!). Mayuko was a delight to work with, and made us feel very welcome in her home,as well as giving us lots of good advice about things to do/see in Tokyo. We would absolutely recommend this!"

There was more food than we could eat but it was all super oishi/delicious and fresh. Mayuko is so welcoming, accommodating and friendly, and is a patient and kind instructor. As we left her flat, waving good-bye, my kids couldn't stop telling me how nice she is. It was like being in the house of an old friend. She also gave us some great local tips near our hotel, like grabbing those trendy pancakes overlooking Shibuya crossing. We also went for dipping ramen today per her suggestion, a place we would have never found but we all LOVED! Thank you Mayuko for such an unforgettable experience!

When you sign up for a cooking class with Mayuko, she will send you directions as to where to go along with pictures of the meeting location so you can't get lost! She came and picked us (there were only two of us) up from the train station that is about two or three blocks from her apartment. It was a privilege to be able to visit the home of a local resident in Tokyo and compare it to my own home in Canada. It was more spacious than I thought it would be!I asked Mayuko to show me how to make Japanese Gyoza and you also learn how to make several side dishes along with it. She carefully described each ingredient, their use, some history of the dishes and ingredients, and let us taste each one so we knew what we were putting into our food. She provided us with recipes and directions on how to make the dish so even if you forget, you can always refer back to the recipe! The lesson was about 3 or 4 hours, I cannot recall exactly, but it was great to learn more about Mayuko and Japanese culture from her.Mayuko is incredibly kind, friendly, and helpful when we asked her questions, even if it was not related to the lesson. She helped me look up certain places and activities I was interested in and told me to e-mail her if I ever needed any help or had any questions. She also gave recommendations on desserts or foods to try while in Tokyo and locals know best! She recommended this one dessert/treat that I could buy in Asakusa since I was staying there. I cannot remember the name but it was two pancakes with a red bean paste in the middle which I got the very next day to try. Delicious!If you are visiting Tokyo and you are looking for something unique or different to do during your stay, please give Mayuko's Little Kitchen a chance as it really is a small kitchen! You do not need to bring anything with you other than yourself. Everything will be provided for you! I truly enjoyed the lesson even though I stayed up the entire night before to attend the Tsukiji Tuna Auction!Thank you for a wonderful time and experience Mayuko, I will definitely recommend it to friends who visit Tokyo in the future and wish to learn something while they are there!All the best,Daniel"

Go hungry because you get a good amount of food and it's all so good, you won't want to leave any behind. It is soooo good. Don't think twice and book a class at Mayuko's little kitchen!"

Everything from the emails to organise the class, meeting up and the cooking class itself, were all well organised. We met at the train station and instantly knew that we were in for a great experience. Everything was laid out and ready to go when we got to Mayuko's house which was great. Mayuko explained everything, we got to try different flavors before using them in the cooking and we didn't feel rushed! Mayuko was hospitable and we will be recommending Mayuko to everyone back in Australia. Thankyou!"

Other reviewers have talked about how the class proceeds ... so I'll mainly let my photos do the talking.That said, this class is a great way to get a small glimpse into real life in Japan. Catch the subway to a quite suburban station and meet Mayuko (if you get there too early there is a coffee shop just near the meeting point). Walk five minutes or so through residential streets to her apartment. Squeeze into the (very typical) tiny lift. Shoes off at the door and you are in an actual Japanese home.The class is great and chances are you will be working alongside some interesting fellow travellers. You'll work together to create a wonderful feast and depart for your next adventure with a full belly, new friends, recipes you can easily recreate at home and some great recommendations for further foodie activities during your stay.I visit Tokyo regularly and will most definitely be back."

Mayuko met us at the subway station and we took a short walk to her place. She was fun to talk to, and her English is excellent. For class, we made tempura and ginger pork. She started the class by explaining to us some of the different seasonings and spices used in Japanese cooking. She demonstrated how to cut and cook everything, and then we went to work! Mayuko was there to guide us every step of the way, and the results were amazing! The food was excellent. We really had a very enjoyable time. Sitting down and eating with her was like a little party of friends. At the end, she pointed out some places of interest near her place and showed us how to get there. I highly recommend taking a class with Mayuko if you wish to learn how to cook some Japanese cuisine."

This time the class was about miso. Mayuko explained in clear, easy to understand English, about the different types of miso in use, how they were made and how the tastes differ. We tasted each of five different types of miso and we could clearly tell the differences. After the introduction to the fresh and the dried ingredients, we began the peeling, chopping and mixing. With the preparation completed, we moved on to the making of the dashi for the miso soup. Next came the cooking of the main and side dishes. Everyone was kept involved throughout the cooking and table setting, where we learned the correct way to present a Japanese meal. Finally, we all sat down to a scrumptious home cooked meal which we will be able to reproduce for friends and family once we get home.There can be no doubt that the high praise that Mayuko receives in these reviews is well deserved. Do yourself a favor and book a class early during you stay in Tokyo. Mayuko is happy to give you customized recommendations for what to see and do in Tokyo. It becomes quickly evident that she wants you to enjoy Tokyo to the fullest and go home with a heart full of happy memories."

Mayuko takes time to introduce you to the main ingredients of Japanese cooking and then step by step she takes you through the cooking process. In our case we cooked Japanese dumplings with cucumber and sesame, a traditional squash and bean side dish and the staple miso soup. I would highly recommend taking one of Mayuko's class. She is very accommodating and knowledgable. It was truly a pleasure to meet her and learn not only about the Japanese cuisine but also about Japanese culture and tradition."

My husband and I were welcomed by Mayuko and two other couples at the meeting spot I was given and we all headed back to Mayuko's apt which was conveniently located to the subway and tourist attractions. The class was entertaining as well as knowledgable on the elements of traditional Japanese cooking. Her home was clean and all the items we needed to cook with were ready for our use.

My daughter and I visited Tokyo in March, and I signed up for this class during our pre-trip planning based on the many positive reviews Mayuko received. Mayuko was quick to respond to my emails, and helpful with suggestions in choosing the menu we would be cooking (the first customers to sign up for a particular class gets to pick the menu!). Mayuko takes no more than six customers per class session, allowing for an individualized experience for all. We elected to make a traditional Japanese home-cooked meal, with Japanese dumplings as the main course.Mayuko met us at a train station near our hotel, and together we walked to her \"little kitchen.\" She was well-prepared with the ingredients we would be using laid out on the table, and explained to us over tea the basics of traditional Japanese flavorings and foods. We learned how to make a delicious miso soup, a side dish, salad, and of course the dumplings. The mystery ingredients I sometimes see in Asian stores are no longer so mysterious! When we finished preparing the meal, we asked if she would join us to eat, and thus enjoyed another great part of the evening: talking to her about her culture. Mayuko was extremely gracious, very informative, and a real pleasure to spend time with. We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Tokyo, finding it remarkable how helpful and accommodating the Japanese people are, and we agreed that our time with Mayuko was the most special of all. Mayuko's class is very much worth the time and investment for people visiting this lovely city."

Mayuko has not only explained and showed us how to make this food, but she has also told us a lot about traditional Japanese ingredients, where they come from and what they are made of. She has also shared a lot of stories and traditions of her family. It was so interesting to learn more about local customs in Japan!The atmosphere was great and I had a feeling that I am not in a cooking class, but having dinner with my friends!In the end Mayuko gave us some recommendations on what else to see in Tokyo and recommended some great places to eat.I loved this experience and I would recommend to anyone who is visiting Tokyo to book a class with Mayuko!

So we decided to take a short informal cooking class with Mayuko at Mayukos Little Kitchen which is actually at her cute townhouse.My daughter and I booked our lesson in advance through the website. Mayuko promptly responded and accepted our payment through PayPal. Then she arranged our meeting place by the train station. We were glad to see her big welcoming smile. Then she walked us to her house for the cooking lesson. Mayuko was well organized and speaks fluent English which made it easier for us. Very few Japanese know how to speak English which made it difficult to communicate.We had chicken karaage, seafood hot pot, chicken curry, and miso soup. Mayuko's instructions were simple. We prepared the food and had it for dinner. It costs $100/person which was very reasonable. I was so inspired that I went to the nearest grocery store to buy the ingredients. She wrote the ingredients for me because everything at the store is in Japanese. Besides sight seeing and shopping, I recommend taking cooking lessons when you visit a beautiful city. You learn their customs and tradition as well as food preparation. Cheers!"

Her explanation of the different ingredients was informing and interesting, and she was very clear in her instructions for using these ingredients. Who knew there were so many different types of Miso out there? Her English was near perfect making it easy to follow along while she taught me how to cook with Miso. I definitely recommend one of Mayuko's classes if you are looking for authentic Japanese!"

But we chilled, chatted and got to know each other. Mayuko explained Japanese cuisine and the okinumayaki recipe that we would be cooking. Through the evening it was a wonderful learning process and Mayuko has such a fabulous way of creating a relaxing environment to pass on some of her passion for Japanese food. The best recommendation I can make is that I now feel enthusiasm to sharpen the knives, buy a Japanese cooking book and try to learn more. Thank you for such a lovely time."

Mayuko actually spent some time to explain about Japanese food, importance of each ingredient and various ways that they can be used. I learnt a lot, and really really enjoyed Mayuko's class. The food that she made me cook was absolutely oishee (delicious) and I enjoyed a lovely meal with Mayuko. She even taught me how to lay the table Japanese style. In the end I have walked away having learnt dishes that i can cook when back in India. Overall, the best 3 hours for me. Highly highly recommended.

We found Mayuko's Little Kitchen while browsing TripAdvisor and we were impressed with the outstanding reviews for this cooking class and felt it was something worth trying.We were very pleased that Mayuko responded so quickly to our booking request and she provided all the info that we needed to fit us into a time that worked for us. My wife and I were blown away by today's experience of learning authentic Japanese cooking in Mayuko's little kitchen as well as experiencing Mayuko's cheerful nature and generosity in letting us use her personal kitchen for this class, which only added to the overall experience of authentic Japanese cooking and dining. The food we cooked tasted better than any Japanese food I've tasted before because WE MADE IT OURSELVES and I am most gracious for this opportunity to learn to cook with a local! We really got our hands dirty with chopping, cutting and preparing the food and it was such an enjoyable and educational experience as Mayuko explained to us in great detail about each of the individual ingredients as well as how to complete each step.Mayuko speaks very good English and we had no difficulty in understanding her instructions and meeting with her, and she was so awesome she gave us copies of the recipe at the end so we didn't get overwhelmed with trying to remember everything! She even helped us with tips on what places to visit in Tokyo which we found really helpful as we really wanted honest recommendations from a local living in Tokyo. Upon finishing I feel that we've done more than just completed a Japanese cooking class but my wife and I feel we've just made a new friend in Japan and we would be most honored to have Mayuko over to visit us sometime if she so wished. It was an absolute pleasure spending time with Mayuko and if we visited Japan again we would definitely pop by to say hi whether it be for a cooking class or not. In conclusion, I highly recommend Mayuko's Little Kitchen to anyone interested in learning Japanese cooking with an experienced local. FYI Mayuko has a Facebook page which is worth checking out to see what types of food she's cooked before with other people.Thanks Mayuko we hope to see you again in future!!"

She cordially invites you into her home to do some classic and traditional Japanese food prep that you will love and create memories that will leave you saying \"I'm glad we did that\".Firstly, the cooking is done at her home after she personally meets you at a nearby station. The fact you get to be invited to see a Japanese home is already an experience. Secondly, cooking in a homely environment also lets you relax a bit and is a very nice change from your noisy tourist traps. This is a great chance for down time and an early night if you have been out late multiple nights in a row... Or alternatively, head out straight after to continue the party! Mayuko is very passionate about meeting new people and teaching not only Japanese cuisine but also Japanese culture. She quit her job to focus on this little business full time which is a very respectful risk to take. Because of this, she focuses on making sure your time is perfect. Special food requests and even help about travelling around Japan aren't a problem. English is not a problem at all so feel free to leave the stress of translation behind. As the other reviews prove, this is one you should get onto... And do it quick because it's really hard to get a booking. You won't regret it! "

Mayuko shops for fresh ingredients every day, so the food is absolutely delicious, and it's fun and educational too! This would be perfect for families, couples, friends....or singles! I've made the kabocha squash side dish as well as the miso soup since I've been back home.

During our stay in Tokyo we found out that we had a lot of questions regarding the Japanese culture and food that Mayuko helped us to sort out. Which for us gave a lot of extra value to our visit in Japan. The cooking class will be one of our best memorabel experiences in Tokyo!"

We chose her because the location was close to our hotel and for the variety of classes offered. We wanted to learn more about miso and tofu. We are both fairly experienced (but not professional) cooks and have taken Japanese cooking classes in Japan but still we both learned an amazing number of tips. Mayuko is very organized - booking went smoothly and it was very convenient and easy to meet her at the train station. Mayuko is a trained chef - she knows what she is talking about. She works from home - but still it was a good kitchen for giving cooking lessons in. We also were able to learn a lot about Japanese culture - which is one of the main reasons we take cooking classes when we travel. For example, we learned the placement of dishes and utensils for a proper Japanese meal. The recipes seemed quite authentic, not \"dumbed\" down for tourists as at the other cooking school we visited. As a result, the meals were very tasty."

The first part was a small and enjoyable lesson about basic concepts of the japanese cooking, with tasting. Very informative. Then, we cooked and observed, with very good tools, especially knives. At the end, after \u00e0 very good meal, Mayuko gave us all information we asked about Tokyo and walked us tio the nearby Meiji shrine. In the end, I can strongly recommend Mayuko's cooking lessons."

If you are planning a trip to Tokyo and are looking for a cooking class, then you could not possibly make a better choice than Mayuko's Little Kitchen. Not only will you learn the basics of Japanese home cooking, but in just a couple of hours you will also learn about Japanese culture, how the ingredients are made, and get recommendations for interesting places to visit in Tokyo.Mayuko will meet you at the train station and escort you on a five minute stroll to her apartment in a lovely residential neighborhood. By the time you arrive at the home, you will already have discovered what a truly delightful, charming, and welcoming person Mayuko is.Once the lesson starts you will also find her to be very knowledgable, experienced and helpful. She provides printed instructions for your chosen menu items so that you need not be worried about remembering all of the details. You can just enjoy the cooking experience first hand while she expertly guides you through each step. Even though you will be cooking multiple dishes simultaneously, Mayuko will ensure that the outcome will be a spectacular success.When the cooking is done, you will learn about the crucial step of food presentation. The finished product will be a feast for the eyes as well as the tummy.And the best part is having the meal together with Mayuko when all the preparation is complete. Have no doubt - you will have prepared a delicious and balanced meal. Mayuko will see to that. And Mayuko will make you feel like a welcomed friend in her home. I can only repeat what many reviewers before me have said. This may very well be the best part of your visit to Tokyo."

So friendly and if she can make my cooking taste nice, she has serious skill. The whole experience was so amazing that before we left Japan we booked on for another night. This time making Gyoza Dumplings and Chicken Terriyaki. It was easily the best part of my holiday. Such an amazing experience and such a beautiful person. Thanks Again Mayuko. Dan"

And the high-light of the day for me was to cook Tofu! It took only 15-20min to cook but tasted owesome, very rich and flavorful of soy-beans!

Some of the reasons listed below:1. Great location- very central. We took a train to teach there and Mayuko picks you up from the station so makes it even easier! We walked about 5 minutes to reach the location. The class is held in her apartment kitchen which gives an insight to Japanese lifestyle and makes it even more personal. 2. We are vegetarians and Mayuko was able to modify the menu to accommodate us which was really nice!3. Mayuko speaks great English so it was very easy to understand. 4. She began with teaching us the basics about Japanese cooking and then went on to making 4 dishes. It was a hands on class and really fun to learn how to make Japanese food! Can't wait to make it now that we are back home!! :) It was even more interesting when Mayuko told us how you can substitute ingredients if you can't find some ingredients in your country.5. After cooking we all ate the food - lunch was awesome :) She gave us a printed menu and recipes in English (with Japanese translation next to it) in case we wanted to buy any ingredients before we left the country. Thought that was extremely smart of her! To top it all, we didn't have time to go to the supermarket as we had to rush to the airport, so she was so nice that she gave us the bamboo mats! If I had to recommend one must do thing in Tokyo - it would be this!"

Of all the cooking classes I read, I seemed to keep coming back to her site. So I sent her a message via facebook inquiring about her cooking lessons. She was very accomodating. She answered all my queries. I told her what I wanted to learn and she gladly gave in to my requests. In Japan, she met us (I was with my husband and daughter) at the train station and accompanied us going to her house. She was very nice and cheerful. Although, I was the only one taking the lesson, she gladly welcomed my family and we do appreciate that. Her teaching was \"hands on\" so it was easier for me to learn. She even allowed my daughter to wrap the gyoza. My daughter had a lot of fun doing that. All the food we cooked were very yummy. We (together with my family) shared all the food we cooked. Thy were all delicious. No dull moment in the class. She even answered all our questions re: Tokyo like where to go, how to go there, where to buy stuff, etc. Indeed, it was all worth it. When I go back to Tokyo, I will definitely go to Mayuko again."

My friend and I did the class as the last experience in Tokyo and we wished we had done it as soon as we landed. Not only does Mayuko teach you about how to make the food, but she is incredibly knowledgable about the history, origin and tastes of the food. If we would have done this class to begin with, we would have been able to engage with Japanese food on another level throughout the whole trip.Mayuko creates a warm ambience in an authentic kitchen, so it feels like you are having a fun experience with an old friend. The best part about the course is that you can easily apply it for yourself when you get back home. You learn techniques that are intricate but simple enough to do on your own. I appreciated that I felt confident after the class that I could try it again on my own.The most important part though is that the food is DELICIOUS. We loved the food we made together and left Tokyo with a full belly and great memories. Mayuko is a great!!! Definitely recommend as a must do when in Tokyo!"

Mayuko is kind, patient, and allows you to take the helm during parts of the class. She kindly welcomes you into her Shibuya home. She thoughtfully teaches you the fundamentals of Japanese cuisine. This foundation is critical for anyone who hasn't cooked Japanese food before, much like us! We learned to make Miso soup, a bean & squash dish, and sushi. Definitely bring a camera to capture the dishes you'll make. What I really liked about the class is that Mayuko doesn't do all the cooking -- she starts you off, and then lets you go! This is how we truly learned. Her kindness and desire to give us tips about other parts of Tokyo is something we'll remember. We took her up an some of her suggestions, and they were a blast! If I could go back to Tokyo to do another class, I'd do another class with Mayuko. She was one of the biggest highlights of our trip to Japan."

We chose the Japanese meal option where Mayuko would teach you to make a main, two sides and a soup. This class not only teaches you to cook. Mayuko generously shares the many little tips for Japanese cooking and interesting facts of the Japanese culture! She is very engaging, ensuring we get our hands dirty (not to wash the dishes!) in preparing the meal. Classes are conducted in her very cosy and lovely abode. Mayuko candidly shares tips about exploring Tokyo. It was a pity that we hadn't gone to her place earlier during our stay in Japan. She is committed to improving her command of English to ensure communication with her guests is an ease! No language barrier at all! In short, Mayuko is clearly passionate about her craft and her culture! We left with full tummies and very warm hearts!!"

A relaxed setting with a wonderful atmosphere created by Mayuko. I can't wait to cook the meals back in Australia for my friends and apply the new principles I've learnt. I did the Okonomiyaki meal as its my favourite Japanese food! Thank you Mayuko, and thanks for sharing insights into things I've noticed here from a locals perspective!"

This activity was a highlight of our trip to Japan because we were able to learn about Japanese culture and experience a home-cooked meal that we can easily replicate on our return home. Mayuko was friendly and helpful, booking/payment was a breeze, and the course was customized to our specific interests. As vegetarian and vegan cooks we were keen to learn some traditional dishes that could be modified for preparation without fish stock and meat. Mayuko gave us several options, and we were even able to request a recipe using eggplant because we'd had some great Japanese eggplant dishes in the past.The cooking was fun, Mayuko was a pleasure to meet, and we gained some great insight into Japanese family life, culture, and eating habits."

It almost felt like being invited for dinner at a friends place, although we had to cook the meal ourselves. Of course, with good instructions, preparations and some help from Mayuko. We choose the cook a hotpot (with shellfish), something we\u2019re not familiar with, and it was fun. Together with the accompanied dishes, it all tasted very pure and subtle, we had a little feast meal after some hard work. .

After several days of sightseeing in and around Tokyo with my dad and brother, we were looking for an authentic insight into Japanese everyday life when we stumbled upon this gem. Surrounded by the hustle and bustle of a world-class metropolitan city, we found ourselves in the comfortable confines of a pleasant Japanese neighborhood. We selected the Typical Japanese Family Menu, which included a cucumber sesame salad, pumpkin and red bean dish, miso soup, and pork and vegetable dumplings with a side of steamed rice. Mayuko began with interesting cultural and historical background on Japanese cuisine, including information about flavors and ingredients, as well as Japanese etiquette. Then it was time to get to cooking! We loved chopping, slicing, dicing, mixing, and wrapping our dishes. Mayuko was attentive and helpful throughout, allowing us to do the vast majority of the prep and cooking. All the food was phenomenally delicious, but I have to say my favorite dish was the typically humble miso soup. Will definitely make that dish at home! Aside from being a fabulous teacher and superb cook, Mayuko is the sort of person that you wish lived next door to you. We are thankful to say we made a friend in Tokyo."

Everything was fresh and organized. Mayuko walked us through some of the thinking behind Japanese cooking followed by a step by step guide for each dish. She was very articulate and had tasks for everyone, including our son. Not only were the tips and instructions all very helpful, we managed to cook an amazing meal!

By 7pm, we were sitting at her table, learning to make sushi and home style Japanese dishes. She's a great teacher who clearly puts a lot of love into her work, and has a wide knowledge of what Tokyo and Japan have to offer. She gave us great tips on what to do around the city. My advice: make Mayuko's Little Kitchen the first stop on your itinerary. It's a solid gateway into an amazing country!"

My husband and I were visiting Tokyo for 4 days and after poking around on Trip Advisor and reading the reviews for Mayuko's Little Kitchen, we decided to see if she had any classes available - and lucky for us, she did! We LOVED every minute of the experience - from being in her little kitchen and being able to not only learn about what we were cooking, but also to ask questions about Tokyo, the neighborhood we were in, Japan, etc. - we learned so much! Hands down, meeting Mayuko and taking her cooking class was the highlight of our trip - and we did a lot of wonderful things! There's something so valuable about being with a local, and learning to cook something new. We walked in as guests in her kitchen and we left as friends."

You can get not only the key point of \"real\" Japanese dishes but also a lot of vivid information about sightseeing of Tokyo, which you never get from the Internet or guide books. I took the lesson with my friends from Chile who had never cooked Japanese dishes but we were able to cook all without feeling stress. That was really fun.Moreover, Mayuko gave some latest information about boutiques, museums and restaurants to my friends. I believe that it made my friends' trip more exciting."

We found Mayuko on Trip Advisor earlier this year and she was kind enough to accommodate my wife's seafood allergy. On the day, Mayuko picked us up from the nearby train station and escorted us to her home. We were taught how to prepare and cook miso shiru, gunskan zushi, makizushi and kabochano nimono. Mayuko is an exceptional teacher. She is very well-organised and takes her time to explain the origins of each of the ingredients we use. Mayuko is incredibly warm, kind and funny. Not only did we gain invaluable cooking skills and techniques, we also made a friend, whom we are sure we will meet again soon! We cannot recommend this enough - a must do for anyone visiting Tokyo!"

            "review": "Everyone visiting Tokyo MUST try!. I really encourage you to try \"Mayuko's Little Kitchen\". Why?Well, for starters, Tokyo is such a huge, bustling city, with so many people, that it can be hard for foreigners to communicate with the locals. I think food and talking are the best ways to truly understand Japanese culture. Furthermore, Mayuko speaks perfect English, so it's easy to talk to her.Under Mayuko's gentle, patient guidance - and I'm an absolute beginner when it comes to cooking Japanese food - I learnt how to make \"maki-zushi\" and, \"Japanese-style steamed pumpkin\". Wow, when we sat to down eat, I could hardly believe I'd made it myself!Not only is Mayuko a great teacher, but she is a cheerful, enthusiastic person, too. You will definitely enjoy talking to her, and eating yummy, homemade food. Mayuko's kitchen may be little, but she has a big heart!"

Communication before hand was good and we were met at the train station without difficulties. She was lovely, warm and kind and could not have been more patient and informative. We made a few dishes and the children and I assisted and we got to eat them at the end. We were so full! The children continue to ask about 'the nice lady'. Would definitely recommend! X"

She was well prepared to teach us the basics of cooking with miso and prepare four dishes together, but also adapted to our questions about cooking techniques and other dishes. The class drew an interesting group of Japanese native and expatriates, so you're likely to have an interesting conversation while you cook. Like cooking together in the house of a friend, if you happened to be friends with a seasoned chef. Highly recommend."

Mayuko explained dashi and the ingredients in the beginning of the class so that we all had a basic idea.We made 3 different kinds of dashi and I was surprised how little did i know about it even as a Japanese person.It was a class of 3 people and we just did not stop laughing. Now I am very inspired to cook more after leaning such beauties of Japanese dishes. I highly recommend this class if you are looking for a fun but resourceful activity in Shibuya-Shinjuku area."

Mayuko's Little Kitchen let me experience what a Japanese family would cook and serve at home. I loved the warm and friendly atmosphere and especially Mayuko's sense of humour. There was plenty of laughter and fun in her class.Not only is the food delicious but also beautiful. I especially enjoyed learning to make Golden Curry and my sushi favourite 'Inari'. The lesson is easy to follow and you feel you are welcomed into Japanese home life.A great experience I highly recommend.Mayuko's Little Kitchen will make you smile. I did :)"
