The views from the terrace over the ocean were breathtaking and the sunset a spectacle not to be missed. We dined in the main restaurant at a table with ocean views, a constant reminder of the setting, the staff were all so professional and friendly without being intrusive a real pleasure to have them waiting on. The meal was absolutely excellent and was served with little added extras that were surprising and different, the wines were very good.I would thoroughly recommend a visit to this hotel to savour the sunset and sample the wonderful fare on offer."

We went for dinner so didnt really benefit from the spectacular views that we saw on our second visit during the day. The restaurant was decorated beautifully and combined elegance with style. I was very impressed with the overall ambiance. The service was very good and our waiters helpful when we were choosing nwhat to eat and drink. I can definitely recommend the Chenin Blanc it was one of the best I have had. My food choice was catch of the day and a huge sea bass was placed in front of me with fresh veggies. Perfwct is all I can say."

Residential land is therefore, at a premium and parking is normally a nightmare - over the holiday season, almost impossible. Best way to get there if you are a visitor to Cape Town, is to use the red hop on hop off bus, as there are several places along Victoria Drive where good photo ops can be found."

The easiest is to see the Twelve Apostles from the beach or the highway. The City Sightseeing buses allow for a good view of the Twelve Apostles. The guide emphasized that there are more than 12 formations. Cross-cutting faults separate multiple peaks of the Twelve Apostles. Overall quite impressive powerful creation of nature."

You must book a car (uber) or have one to get here. Also, welcome to the 90s. The hotel knows how famous it is because it seriously needs an updating. it feels like it was done in 1992. and it's much smaller than you think. Go for a very expensive drink, get your pics then go back to the Mount Nelson:)"

The view from the leopard bar is spectacular, great sunset pictures. Pools are lovely but a little cool when we were there so we didn't take advantage of them. We were busy doing all the tourist things. The hotel does have a shuttle that will bring you into Cape Town proper and that is great. We also used the shuttle for a trip to Table Mountain. I certainly wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel but remember, it is not in walking distance of any attraction. They also have a great health program that my daughter took advantage of. She is a runner and they have people who will run with you. This is also available for hiking and bike riding. There is no charge unless equipment is required, like a bike. Overall, what a wonderful experience!!"

This is about The Twelve Apostles Mountain Range which extends from Table Mountain, above Camps Bay, in the direction of Hout Bay, to Llandudno. The range is called this because the mountain range has twelve peaks which are easily distinguishable. If you are looking for The Twelve Apostles Hotel and Spa, I think they have their separate reviews page. So in terms of the Twelve Apostles Mountain Range, you can drive it (it is very scenic) or you can hike it (there are a few areas to hike). The hikes are relatively flat and offer spectacular views over Camps Bay. Depending on what you do, the hike can take around 4 hours if you do the whole trail."

This hotel was part of a South Africa tour package, so we didn't know much about it other than the reviews on trip advisor and the praise that our travel agent gave. The location is a little out of the way, but not that far from Cape Town if you have a car (about a 5 minute drive to Camps Bay or 15 minutes to V&A waterfront). There is a free shuttle service from the hotel to these areas which is great if you don't have a car. From the moment you arrive, you are treated like you're in first class. Your check in agent goes over your itinerary and offers you a variety of drinks, then they takes you on a tour of the facility going over details of hours and what services they offer. We were then escorted to our rooms (303 and 304 for a family of 5) which were not connecting but the entry doors were perpendicular to each other. These two particular rooms were at the end of the facility which meant room 304 had an incredible view to the 12 apostles rock formation while room 303 had an open balcony with a spectacular sunset view to the ocean. FYI, the balconies on this level are all connected and are not partitioned off so anyone could walk from one side to the other. However, I never felt this was an invasion of privacy or a security risk. I have to reiterate the sunset view from this room was absolutely breathtaking. Also, the attention to details in each room were so well thought of. For example, all the remote controls for HVAC and TV's were sanitized and individually wrapped. My favorite part was the high pressure rain shower, really refreshing after a long day of touring or shark diving. The kids loved the heated pool and small movie theater with popcorn and milkshakes. The property itself was really amazing with walking trails, helicopter pad, picnic tables with incredible views to the ocean and the mountain backdrop. The restaurant for dinner was very good, but the breakfast buffet was fantastic. There were so many variety of fruits, breads, and hot food that it was good that we stayed multiple days to try everything. Every member of the staff were full of smiles and they were extremely helpful with any questions or request we had. All in all a wonderful choice for anyone who wants a top notch hotel with an amazing view of the ocean near Cape Town."

The view on all sides include Camps Bay, Lion's Head, Victoria Road to Hout Bay and obviously the Twelve Apostle range. Choose from the delicious cake selection or go to the savory display- it's all worth your money. Friendly and efficient staff complete the perfect surroundings."

They can be viewed from the Leopard Lounge balcony while imbibing your favorite cocktail. The 5-star hotel has a wonderful spa facility and one of the best breakfast buffets I have ever witnessed. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Possibly the finest hotel I have ever stayed with."

I have given 4 stars instead of 5 due to a few little things rather than the quality of the treatments, which were superb. The spa is very relaxed and you are given a nice gown and slippers for the course of your day. The room that I was allocated for my treatments was absolutely tiny and could barely accommodate a bed and a therapist - they are certainly optimising their space! That being said it doesn't affect the quality of the treatment but doesn't quite equate to a feeling of full Five star luxury. My day kicked off with a full body scrub, very nice. The room is too tiny to have a shower so the therapist left the room to start a shower for me in the changing rooms and left a new gown and slippers, clean towels etc. You were looked after well but again having to leave the room to shower in the changing room and then return for the other treatments just doesn't quite cut it in my book. I then and a full body massage and a facial both of which were superb. Just one thing Twelve Apostles if you are going to have a display under the facial cut out in the massage bed you really should make sure that it is clean, although I do like to close my eyes if you did look down it really wasn't such a lovely view. Overall though I really enjoyed my treatments and felt super relaxed when I left."

From the incredible views across the Western Atlantic Ocean, to great staff and great food, in very comfortable, eclectic furnished surroundings - it is a gem! Took a business partner and my mom in law (her 75th birthday) and we were so well looked after! Left feeling pampered. The food and wine menus are extensive and mouth/eye watering.

This is a lovely resort, however not what I was expecting from the website and the pricey nightly rate..I had a mountain and ocean view room which was in a far wing of the old yet fairly reasonably maintained resort. It is a much smaller property than I was expecting and a little dated in wear.. Not that the traditional decor was a problem. It needs refining though..The staff were helpful but not overly service focused. Perhaps it was the relaxed South African vibe but I self parked, struggled with my luggage up the far corridors to my room and had to find my way to the dining rooms without a tour or map.The walks and gardens on the surrounding property were fantastic though and such an ideal setting to appreciate the joining of the Indian Ocean and the South Atlantic sea!! The mountain range behind the resort the 'Apostles' are a must see from your room to ground you in South Africa.The breakfast and dining room was spectacular and the service top notch! This portion was definitely five star. Beautiful linens and auspicious food!They have a great patio outside the top floor cocktail bar which overlooks the oceans and on a warm summer's night made my reunion with an old friend a most memorable moment in my life!Thank you for the experience Twelve Apostles, I will be back to stay again.."

We went for afternoon tea on our last day in SA ( to save having to eat the airline food) and what a very pleasent surprise. We had tea on the veranda with wonderful views of the ocean, a light breeze and a selection of savoury and sweet items presented on a wonderful display. We had also been to the Mount Nelson for afternoon tea a few days before. And personally the 12 Apostles Hotel gets my vote. Perfect service, delightful selection of sandwiches, hot scones and dainty cakes and desserts. Just loved it............ and its cheaper ! You might need to book at the height of the season - but the day we went there was plenty of room. Just lovely to sit eating a delicious tea looking at the view."

The 12 Apostles can be appreciated in a variety of ways - by hiking, driving past in three minutes the red tour buses, from the outdoor table at a caf\u00e9. But the best way is to take a walk from end to end of Camps Bay beach - perhaps followed by one of the above. The view from the sand is pretty special and you can get a panoramic photo of the Apostles. Back up on the main road make sure to look out for the cricket ground at the junction with The Meadway - what a view!When self-driving be aware of the cyclists and runners at the southern end of the Apostles where the road rises between 12 Apostles Hotel and Hout Bay. This is a mecca for the fit people of the Cape and they come out in large numbers at the weekend, mornings particularly. And make sure that you drop in to the gorgeous beach at Llandudno, below; the view from the road is worth stopping for, and the beach makes for a pleasant walk but parking is VERY limited."

The Leopard Lounge the fine dining restaurant and the Cafe. The settings for each are all lovely and the service is good but the prices are outlandishly high for average tasting food. Would be nice to have more interesting menus in the cafe and Leopard Lounge and better pricing of those. The menu is rather run of the mill I thought and not terrible but not very tasty. A glass of wine here is expensive for average to not so great local wines so better value and perhaps more interesting choices elsewhere. I think location always adds to the enjoyment of eating experiences but I don't believe loading the prices of your location when the food and wine don't match them is a sustainable model. Hope that things improve here."

My son and I enjoyed very much our stay at the hotel.From the concierge to the manager.. everyone was friendly and did his best to make us feel great. The atmosphere of the hotel is very cosy. Beautiful Paintings hang everywhere. There is also a library: Choose a book, enjoy the see view, drink a tea and try those cupcakes!The see view is fantastic. There is a free shuttle bus to drive you and pick you up from the hotel to Waterfront.They offer private tours too. We went to Franschhoek, discovered the area and visited many ceramic ateliers. The driver knew that my son is fond of engines so he took us to an impressive car museum. What a service! Highly recommended."

The head concierge (Mahood I think? I've slept a lot since then) was so incredibly nice to us as well as the front desk, drivers, and wait staff. We didn't encounter anyone that didn't go out of their way to help us. - Beautiful grounds with a walking path, spa, and pool- A little outside of busy Camps Bay and the Waterfront- Great views of the Atlantic- Great breakfast and food in both restaurantsNow the Con:- We upgraded to a sea-facing room since it was our honeymoon and we love to sleep to the sound of crashing waves. Well, you can hear the waves a little at night but between 10 pm and 6 am all you hear is the sound of cars on the 2 lane highway right below the balcony. On Saturday it sounded like Tokyo drift. I gave it 4 stars just because of the road noise, but other than that it was a wonderful stay. We had a great time on our honeymoon and would definitely return to the Twelve Apostles."

The staff tries to be attentive, but.. functions in a disorganized manner. The exception was the service staff that operated the shuttle service to Capetown. The rooms are nice, but not super special. One night a candle appears, the next night it doesn't. Same with water.Since the hotel is built into the side of the mountain, rooms are found after covering many hallways on different 3-6 step levels. Breakfasts are great, many choices. Maybe if your focus is the beach area, this is a good choice. If your focus is Capetown, as was ours, then you might want to seek other options."

Whenever I come here I am always very eloquently greeted by the ma\u00eetre d but this eloquence does not extend to the waiters. Waiters here almost have a eagerness to the flip the table for the next set of diners but when you are paying 12 apostle prices that is not what you come here for. Another point is that waiters also lack colonial crispness - ties are loose, buttons undone, shoes not polished - the reason this stands out is because the look of these waiting staff does not reflect the quality and opulence which the hotel strives for. The food is good but definitely not the best on the Atlantic side and could be described as good tapas for a sea-side caf\u00e9 except that it is not. The view however, wow, that does make up for it - more than make up for it. In conclusion, come dine here for a great view but don't expect what comes out of the kitchen to wow Gordon Ramsay in terms of taste and service."

Clouds just flew down as water from above to the balcony of our apartment. It's a unique feeling - dinner with wine in the middle of cloudy mist. This is also the luxury region of the city were you can meet different celebrities and have all kinds of leasure time. And Camps Bay beech is one of the most beautiful in Cape Town, but the ocean is very cold, only few braves can swim."

Don and I, had the opportunity of enjoying the sight of these beautiful peaks while we were in Cape Town.We had a second viewing when we tool a cruise to Robeen Island from the Victoria and Alfred waterfront. Now I wish we had hiked, but the say we drove along the weather was not that great. I would recommend hiking along the path for a better view and enjoying being at higher grounds.Many people confuse the Twelve Apostles in South Africa with those in Australia. The Australian ones seem to be more popular than the South African ones, nonetheless, they are such a picturesque sight to see and photograph."

(Please do not review the hotel here).The Twelve Apostles is a range of small mountain peaks that run along the coast with the beautiful suburb of Camps Bay against its slopes.The 12 Apostles are great to look at, take pictures of from a sunset cruise (available from the Waterfront) or to walk along its hiking paths (please check this is still done and hike in groups of 4 or more close to Cape Town centre)."
