We rented an apartment in Alfama and spent a lot of times exploring the neighborhood, walking the alleys (called beco), up and downs stairs, taking pictures, just savoring the experience and the scenery, so unique and authentic. Make sure you stop by the Miradouro de Santa Luzia at the end of the afternoon for a fabulous view and a drink, it quickly became our ''tradition'' while in beautiful Lisbon. A great area to stay while visiting Lisbon, or to spend the day if staying elsewhere. It is truly unique area and a must-see, we absolutely LOVED it!"

You need to be in good shape and physically quite fit to be able to go up and down every and each time when you move from Alfama, or just take the famous tram 28 or 12. But this area is quite silent at nights, secure and can be also animated. You\u2019ll find a lot of tourists over there, but come on, sometimes we are all tourists!!! No problem with this. I liked also the composition of the streets, the colours before the sung went down, or early in the morning. Try to find hidden cafes, courtyards, bistros, just to feel the fantastic atmosphere of this area."

Although we stayed in an apartment through VRBO, it seems to be a great place for backpackers - many hostels. A great little spot across from Museo del Fado had inexpensive sandwiches and drinks. Near the river you get a lovely breeze in the evening which made it more comfortable than other parts of the city. Also good for souvenir shopping -- good selection and less expensive than other areas."

So some people say there is nothing to do when you get up into Alfama, but it is all about the journey there and back.You can walk up the hill through all the narrow streets or get the 28 tram from the city centre, yes it is a bit of a tourist thing to do, but worth it. The 28 tram will drop you off at Miradouro de Santa Luzia on the top of the Alfama district. You can use one of the little blue pre paid cards to get on the tram, very useful if your in the City for a day or three.Miradouro de Santa Luzia is like a large open sq where the trams stop and has a small coffee shop, but is like the gateway left and right to the rest of the area.You can go down next to the old wall and into the very old part of the town where houses still have no bathroom or toilet or go up and out to the castle area and the Pantheon or the Se Cathedral.Either way is full of great sights and picture ops.Walk in and out around all the passages and icons it is well worth it, you will find gems everywhere."

Small, quaint and authentic restaurants are everywhere, many featuring live fado music, the Portuguese version of Spanish flemenco. Our apartment is only a ten-minute walk down the hill to the huge Commercial Plaza that rivals some of Europe's great spaces like San Marco in Venice or the Piazza della SIgnoria in Florence. But remember--this neighborhood requires lots of walking up and down steep grades, because vehicles simply cannot reach many of the houses. Bring comfortable shoes."

Indeed, as our guide told us, the streets were born around the houses. So not only is it on a very steep hill, but it's also full of steps, cobbles, and it is very narrow in places. But you should really, definitely go round and round as the atmosphere in this part of the city is incredible. You close your eyes and you can fell the vibe. The houses are as narrow as the streets so naturally, people extend their habitat in the street. It means that anywhere you go, you share a little time of their lives with them: you know what they eat, you know what clothes they washed, you know what tv programme they watch. It is also a great place to see fados, the real ones, not the commercial ones. Don't miss it!"

Ant the view from the top is spectacular - a multitude of rooftops on all levels, incvluding the long bridge in the background. Just go there!"

Plenty of really good eateries from the posh to the canteen like! Also many little grocers who stay open until midnight run by the ubiquitous Pakistanis and Bangladeshis (so language is not a problem for English speakers). Judging from the noise at night some people live on 4 or 5 hours of sleep a night because it's the centre for Fado. That means most little restaurants have live music most nights and some seem only to come alive after midnight.A reasonably short stroll takes you into the grid of the rebuilt city centre although we find the trek up the hill to the castle area and the Graca much more exciting and revealing. Some bits look as if they have been undisturbed for centuries but in reality the the general feeling is that before long tourism will take over the whole area and it'll become a huge ghetto for cash rich foreigners. But to bring you back down to level visit the flea market on Saturdays and Tuesdays. Lotsa tourists there but also lotsa Portuguese bargaining away like their life depended on getting that fine half pair of used false teeth for under 3 Euros! Graca is just up the hill and has a small town feeling which means the prices are lower and it's best if you have some Portuguese language skills."

The Alfama is spread on a very steep hill, so be prepared for some sore legs at the end of the day and, if it's a hot day, make sure you have some water with you (or buy it from one of the many cafes). If physical effort is not your thing, you can also catch the famous tram 28; just be mindful of pickpockets."

The further you move into the core of the area it flattens out so it does get better. In the evenings it's a hustle and bustle and you can find some awesome restaurants. Lots of souvenir shops as well, be weary of the price difference from shop to shop. Make sure you check a few places before you buy.

Sadly, many of the restaurants just want to serve indifferent food to the hordes of tourists, while their in house Fado singer performs. There are gems, but be prepared to look hard."

It's very busy and a bit of a tourist trap but we found a table in one of the local restaurants. The food was ok but the singing was amazing, those guys have a good set of lungs on them. I did notice that one table was being shushed by the owner as they were talking through the singing. The food was ok but it was a good night to our holiday."

Small narrow streets and alleys up and down the hills, beautiful miradouros with gorgeous views. Many of these buildings are more or less run down, but they are very old and many of them survided the earthquake of 1755. It's very easy to get lost here but that only adds to the charm.During the summer months there are sometimes simply too many tourists around, and some authentic old fashioned restaurants have become tourist traps with elevated prices, but one can still find a lovely place for a good meal at reasonable price.For some reason Alfama is not as much a victim of graffiti as Bairro Alto where some fantastic historical buildings have been spoiled with ugly spray paintings.Alfama has managed to keep it's charm."

The narrow, winding streets and walkways have the feel of a real neighborhood. The people are friendly and welcoming as is typical in Portugal. One night, while following the light from Google maps which was failing miserably in showing us the way, a woman came out of a restaurant and told us she was not let us be lost in her city. She walked us part of the way and then passed us off to someone who was more familiar with where we were going. Alfama was a very comfortable place to spend the six nights we spent in Lisboa. I can't wait to go back."

We would have liked to have spent more time in the Alfama but unfortunately the hilly topography of the area was far from friendly for our kids' double stroller. We therefore opted to get transport to the Castelo and walk down once we'd visited that. If walking up isn't the best option for you either (I would have in the early morning had I not had the kids), you can get there with the tram or elevador. We however, chose a taxi. Taxis are very reasonably priced by European capital city standards, I'd even say they're cheap and a ride will probably cost you the same as public transport unless you have an all-inclusive pass like the Lisboa Card. The area has the charm of an old medieval town bang in the centre of the capital city. Unlike the old part of town back home, it is very much an active part of the city with mostly local residents, bars and cafes. A must if you want to experience the real feel of Old Lisbon."

You have to look out for pickpockets as they are very skilled at undoing any exposed zips and grabbing whatever is on top. So many fantastic restaurants to chose from that you are spoiled for choice."

Wherever you go in each corner you will find a surprise. Also near by is the National Pantheon and more stunning buildings around you can appreciate.

Only walking around, taking pictures with the gorgeous sea at the back and then relaxing it was enough for me to say this is a must during your visit in Lisbon. We had to decide between going there and Belem and definetely we don't regret for our choice, cheap food, lovely people and picturesque views. Tips for choosing the right place to eat: only the ones with hand written menus, kinda dirty and not too fancy, that way you make sure you're having 100% fresh food made that day."

There are nice attractions, viewpoints and hours worth of lovely streets to wander, which make for a rewarding day of sightseeing. Notable attractions include church visits to S\u00e9 de Lisboa (The Cathedral of Lisbon), Santo Antonio de Lisboa and Igreja da Sao Vicente de Fora for starters and you'll definitely want to spend a bit of time at Castelo de Sao Jorge if you are a first time visitor.You can also take in fine viewpoints at locations such as Miradouro de Santa Luzia, Miradouro das Portas do Sol, the hillside of Castelo de Sao Jorge and the rooftop access at Igreja da Sao Vicente de Fora. I also very much enjoyed wandering the narrow streets of Alfama, which are lined with traditional buildings, small shops, bars and restaurants. Dining experiences during our recent visit where quite good in Alfama, particularly for traditional Portuguese cuisine. Just find a place that seems to have locals dining instead of throngs of tourists, and you'll likely be in for a treat. You can walk to Alfama from central locations in Lisbon in 20-30 minutes, taking in the attractions as you make your way through this district. Alternatively, Tram No. 28, transverses the district as well. This is a nice activity for those who have not tried street trams before. Overall, I very much enjoyed time spent in Alfama during a recent stay in Lisbon. It is well worth at least a half day of sightseeing and more if time allows."

The neighborhood is build into a hillside, so be prepared for many ups and downs - your calf muscles will get a workout, but the numerous gelato shops and bakeries in the area will make it worth it! The entire district is currently undergoing a major gentrification, so there is quite a bit of construction going on.

It's not that well signposted and you need a map, because you can't always see either the Tagus of the castle to get your bearings. At last we started to see the narrow streets and alleys foe which it is famous for. Everywhere were the signs of hard partying the previous night. The aroma of beer led us into the alleys where empty beer bottles, plastic glasses and discarded food plates were everywhere. They were being swept up or hosed down by small armies of council workers. The closed bars and grills were each side of the streets and very few buildings didn't have one outside it. The tinsel garland festooned streets went on for ages before leading us down to the river and open spaces. I loved it but unfortunately, I could only imagine what it would have been like to be there the night before!"

We like the cobbled, medieval and Moorish flavour of the place. It was beautiful in the daylight, walking on the sunny side of the city, intriguing in the rain and safe in the evening, with strains of fado on the night air. We liked the walkable cobbled streets, although this is not a place for choosing fashion over sturdiness in footwear. There are many welcoming caf\u00e9s where you can slip inside for a cold beer or enjoy a cappuccino on the terrace either in sun or shade. This is also the part of the city that seems to have the most interesting stores filled with artifacts, antiques, arts and crafts - most at very reasonable prices."

To get on board the cable card you will need to obtain the metro card on any station first. The line is busy but is worth the wait!! The cable car will take you places the \"Tuk-Tuk\" will not. Reach the top of Alfama and come down walking. Many squares on Alfama, lots of small places to have local beers or else! Alfama takes over an hour to visit. Gilberto- PR"

Delightful maize of narrow sometimes very steep streets which leads from the city upto St George's Castle. Although once had a great status in the city it is now a trendy area of Lisbon.One way through Alfama is to ride on Tram 28 which is the most notable tourist attraction which great views of the city and the River Tagus. Please note this district has very limited public transport either walk, take a taxi or the tram.On you way up you will have the Cathedral, a good pit stop, great shops to look in,washing hanging out of windows - a real cultural district.

The Alfama, the old quarter of Moors and Jews, keeps its atmosphere plenty of beauty and mistery, principally at the time the moon visits Lisbon\u2026I call the Alfama a proof of faith because during the Great Earthquake, it was merely damaged (though its population wasn't exactly \"good, old Christians\" so, if this was a celestial punishment, why it didn't hurt the \"infidels\" first and most?)We didn't have an strict schedule what to visit, so we just start walking\u2026then, we found fountains, read names of streets with old engraves that told us about who lived there and what did them do for living. Of course, a visit to the Cathedral is \"a must\" \u2013this heavy, fortress-like building, has a few highlights worth to see.Two tips: (1) If Fados interest you and you're travelling around and visit also Coimbra, just leave the expensive (and very \"tourist\") recitals at the Alfama and go straigth to Santa Cruz caf\u00e9 (beside the church with the same name, on 8 de Maio square)! There, you'll find local singers and exquisite guitarists (most of them, students al Coimbra's University) and a majority of Portuguese people from all over the country (that makes the evening much more interesting because they usually join the singers and you also can change a few words with locals)!! You don't have to pay any extra money, just the normal price for coffee or/and cake, and you can spend the whole night longing (if you understand the lyrics! otherwise: imagine!)(2) If you came to Lisbon by car, try to pick a spot at Bacalhoeiros street (very near Saramago's foundation). This street is one of the extremely rare streets with free parking! You can seat and drink a coffee nearby and ask some of the employees to have a look at the car now and then\u2026we spent 3 nights in Lisbon and just left the car there from the very beginning (it's just worthless to drive in Lisbon!)"

Now every return is always a pleasure and I love the fact that not much has changed since and probably for more than 100 years. It is one of the most interesting part of the city to discover by foot and also by tram with the number 28 which will go through the most narrow streets you will experience in a capital city. Of course the castelo S\u00e3o Jorge and its glorious Miradouro alone is a good reason to go to Alfama in the first place."

Then you see and here what happens when their soccer team wins the championship.

Use Tram 28, we did and a full circuit gave us the lie of the land and on the return journey we jumped off at Gra\u00e7a where we walked up past the barracks and enjoyed great views from one of the highest viewpoints in Lisbon. From here we navigated the narrow, winding, quaint and cobbled streets of Alfalma the former Moorish area, taking in the flea (thieves) market and Pante\u00e3o Nacional. The Pante\u00e3o Nacional's position meant that my climb to the 4th floor not only gave me a close up of its huge dome, but impressive views over Alfalma down to the Rio Tejo. Inside the balcony at this level gives you dizzy views of the internal space that plays homage to Portugal's heroes. Our biggest blunder was to then try and pick our way to the castle, where many hilly streets and tired legs later, we realised we should have got back onto the Tram and taken it down to the Cathedral (drops you outside) and used the 737 bus from the city to drop us close to the Castle entrance."

This is something that you must experience, but do it with a lot of energy!TIP: There are two elevators that will take you up to a higher level instead of climbing up steep hills. Once you are up there, have a look at the view, but don't forget to look around you at the charming little area where fishermen and their families have lived for centuries. Theirs is a way of life unique to Lisbon where women can be found to lean out windows and gossip to their neighbors while they hang laundry on lines connected to posts that are supported by the bottom of wine bottles cemented into the walls. Look for them and you will see them everywhere. The best thing to do is to take a walking tour of the area to learn a little more about what you are seeing and stop at certain points of interest. This is a richly endowed area of Portuguese culture that can only be appreciated when experienced.This is also a terrific place to stop for a traditional Portuguese meal of codfish or octopus!

Visiting the Alfama District of Lisbon is like going to the \"Georgetown\" area of Washington, DC ... the \"Greenwich Village\" neighborhood of New York City ... or the \"North End\" of Boston! How can one even begin to describe \"What\" to see or do ... or what shouldn't be missed?! There's just SO much for the adventurous visitor willing to 'just follow one's nose\"!As Lisboa is one of the oldest cities in Europe, the Alfama District reflects that fact and more! It's a great place for walking around, just taking in the sights and sounds.Fortunately for us, one of our family is native born Portuguese and his knowledge of both the city and the language allowed us to delve much deeper into the Alma than what a short, whirl-wind \"formally guided\" tour might have provided. Not having to adhere to any set schedule also gave us lots of flexibility.We stopped in at shops just for fun ... sampled food and wine wherever our noses led us ... and spent a wonderful and leisurely afternoon at the Castelo de S\u00e3o Jorge.We took a taxi UP the steep hills TO the castle ... then leisurely walked back DOWN the cobblestone streets. Strongly recommend you do some advance research before visiting for the first time so you can maximize both your time and enjoyment. Equally important, bring your camera & wear comfortable walking shoes! The cobblestone streets are 'fun' ... but can be killers for those wearing just sandals or 'flats'. An umbrella is also a good idea if you visit in late fall/winter/early spring."

As our guide told us, the residences of Alfama are very proud of the place they live in so be respectful and tell them Alfama \u00e9 linda (Alfama is beutiful) and they just might offer you a glass of wine or some food"

As an Old Town lover (wherever I go my first choice is to walk in Old Part of the city and to feel that aura) walking and seeing things in Alfama made my travel worth for it. Mixed culture, muslim and christian ornaments on the buildings, lovely people - neighbours, fado music in the cafes, from the upper side view to the Tajo River makes Alfama unique in it's own way. Definitely must see place for Mixed Culture and Old town lovers."

The food was amazing and although pricier than other meals we had, it was worth the extra euros - for 3/4 starters (bread, olives, cheese and sausage) 2 mains and a bottle of wine it was just under 100 euros.

The fleemarked is fun, I bought DVD's for 0,50 to 1 euro a piece, make sure it say ingles audio on the cover! The yellow tram 28 goes up through Graca and ends near Rossio Metro station, there visit Sao Domingo Church, absolutely wonderful and special. Read its history on the net first. It's a Jewish memorial star outside in the front of a Massacre in the 15th century. If you take the tram the other way, you arrive at Lisbon SE Cathedral, on the otherside of the street is St Anthony's of Paduas birthplace, on with is erected a church, visit the crypt, Pope John Paul ll visited the crypt 12/5-82, before he went on to Fatima on the 13/5-82, to place the bullet that hit him, in the Crown of the Lady of Fatima. Further down the street you find Luzia miradouro, with a stunning view to the river, then walking downwards is the St Mary Magdalena Church and continue your walk down to Rua de Augusta, have fun!"

This was a lovely walk filled with great views, lovely buildings, and charming side streets. I ended the day in the large squares below and chiado and Baixa walk. Highly recommend these walks for a slice of Lisbon. My Fitbit said this amounted to 6 miles of walking and 56 flights of stairs so wear the right shoes. The key to enjoy this spot is to walk and soak in the atmosphere. I did it over a day and found it not at all tiring."

Or (but be warned they are often full) the No 28 Tram is one of the old-fashioned trams and will take you on a scenic route through the district but not as near to the castle as the bus.Great little cafes can be found down little alley ways and I had my first taste of the amazing Portuguese custard tart in one such cafe."

Alfama, the heart of historic Lisbon, consists of a maze of cobblestone streets, many stairs, small bars and cafes, amazing views, picturesque buildings and friendly locals. I initially took a guided tour to get the 'feel' for the area, and then returned on my own to wander the streets and neighbourhoods watching neighbours chatting, laundry hanging out to dry, the sounds and smells of meals being prepared, amazing views, and enjoying the sense sof community that is ever present. The walk is tiring, whether going up hill or down, so stop at one of the many cafes and enjoy ginjiiha (cherry liquor) or a sweet treat. While trams pass through the neighbourhood, walking the narrow and winding streets is the best way to discover the unique atmosphere of the area. You are almost bound to get lost, so don't worry about it .... enjoyi the sights, smells and sounds of a unique area that has endured for years."

For the last eight years we have always been on a holiday trip to Lisbon during winter break (two weeks sometime between mid-January and mid-February). On a Tuesday or Saturday we take the metro to Santa Apolonia station and climb the steep streets up to the Feira da Ladra, fortifying ourselves by a bica (espresso) or a ginjinha (cherry liquor) at each of the small bars on the road. Feira da ladra is mostly a big flea market, but there are also many stands with new textiles, shoes, books, and music. On the upper part there is a small restaurant (this time unfortunately for us closed due to reconstruction work) that sells local food at a low price and is frequented by the exhibitors (no English spoken!). We then walk upwards to the Graca neighborhood where we take the #28 streetcar. Its wagons once circulated in San Francisco, CA and take you in a breathtaking ride through narrow and devilishly steep streets down to the Baixa and up again to the Chiado square. But there begins another story ..."

This neighborhood is one of the most beautiful in the city, it has tightly packed narrow cobblestone alleyways on steep hills so it is always best to begin exploring Alfama from the top and work your way down which is what we did and wear shoes with good traction. At the top of the hill in Alfama is the castle and at the bottom the estuary. Our walk though Alfama will gave us a glimpse of the traditional way of life in Lisbon and of how most of Lisbon looked before being generally gentrified. Alfama is also the site of S\u00e9 Cathedral, the national pantheon and Saint Anthony\u2019s Church. TRam 28 passes right through this area and right in from of the cathedral. Around the Cathedral we found many small neighborhood cafes where locals hang out, small public squares, churches, tile panels, whitewashed houses, wrought-iron balconies, colorful laundry strung from the windows and window sills dripping with bright flowers. .I learned that Alfama began as a neighborhood inhabited by the Visigoths in the 5th century and you can still find parts of the old Visigoth town wall. After the Visigoths came the Moors and Alfama became an elite residential area. The area suffered from earthquakes but thanks to the solid rock beneath the houses it was one of the few areas in the city that survived the many powerful earthquakes. We liked Alfama because of its village feel where the locals were very friendly to us. Not only does Alfama offer a peak into the historical soul of Lisbon but you can also enjoy views across the city from this elevated neighborhood. As the neighborhood s now more chic, you can now find shopping streets with boutique stores and unique specialty stores but we just loved the architecture. The best way to see Alfama is to get lost and enjoy the picturesque scenes or take the historic tram #28 through the neighborhood."

Our host recommended numerous cafes and restaurants to eat at but the best bit of staying here was to just walk out of the front door and hit the lanes. In addition to being accessible to all major transport links and city attractions, we discovered great little local cafes where we spent many a happy hour using pigeon English and sign language to converse with the locals and drink the local tipple of Ginja (cherry liquer). Really friendly people and uniquely Lisboa!"

There are many slopes in this area and the streets are cobbled so good walking shoes are a must. Very atmospheric, serene and an unhurried place. Lots of meandering narrow lanes. Lots to family run small shops, cafes and restaurants. A lot of construction going on, but many buildings still in their original state.Found out that the name Alfama comes from the Arabic Al-hamma, meaning \"hot fountains\" or \"baths.\""

It's a moorish neighborhood full of history and little intimate corners an alleys. At the bottom is train station and the new cruiseship terminal. At the top is the S.

The best way to visit is to take public transportation to St Charles Castle, visit the castle and then walk downhill through Alfama. We had a car and managed to find a spot close to the castle. Parking is difficult but not impossible. As part of your walk you may visit the Fado Museum and the remains of the Roman Theater. We had coffee and Belem cakes at a charming cafe. We did not eat there as all restaurants appeared a little too touristy. The Alfama comes to life late in the evening when the Fado live entertainment begins in many restaurants. We felt perfectly safe in the dark alleysof Alfama as we criss crossed the neighborhood."

While some areas have larger flat squares that sit near the water. Some ways it reminds me of Amsterdam. Go in comfortable shoes!!! Restaurant and shopping is on every little street so don't miss going into those streets even if it looks bleak. I don't think it's a huge tourist attraction but I liked the area because of its local and quite setting. There is a small plaza where local live entertainment is going on and I was told they performs the local dance of Portugal, Fado. I would go back here so check it out."

In planning a two week trip to Portugal and Spain we had read that Lisbon was a little \"rough\" so we were a little apprehensive (but excited) before we arrived for our three day stay. Pleasant surprise - we loved Lisbon. We stayed in an apartment in the Alfama district. Very close to the Castle and a downhill walk to the center. Lots of atmosphere and steps. Down side, in the evening the locals put out their trash and take their dogs for a walk (watch your step) but in the morning everything was cleaned up.The Portugese we met were extremely friendly and fun to talk to. We were surprised how many spoke English (many spoke several languages). It was also surprising how much we found out about their families in conversation. In comparison, we found the Spanish to be reserved.The food was wonderful and inexpensive. Everything we ate while there was good, especially the seafood and the pastel de nata (a custard tart). We recommend Restaurante O Triguerinho . It's family run restaurant, serves traditional Portugese food and has a cozy neighborhood feel. We ate dinner there three nights. Not in the Alfama but downtown we found a unique store worth a visit. The store sells a variety of canned fish. We're not talking American canned tuna. This stuff is fantastic - the Portugese love their canned fish. The store has table display tables and wall shelves filled with canned fish. They offer samples. We brought some home for an adult son and his first words after taking a bite,\"when can you go back for more?\".We're planning on going back as soon as we can."

Lovely art and craft shops particularly one shop owner/local artist fluent English speaker who fell in love with Alfama characteristics and never left the area!You need to be fairly fit walker due to the slopes - take tuk tuk in rain ."

By all means take a tuk-tuk around the streets and up to the vistas, but then also summon the energy and get out and walk the winding alleys/ streets/ pathways and see that there's a whole authentic way of life here that, in a sense, isnt exactly easy: some areas look startlingly like south american favelas. Abounds with great shops, restaurants, and historical attractions. Plan an afternoon."

There is not really any destination (but the aim should be to get to Castelo Sao Jorge) but unusual, interesting and surprising sights (and I mean sights rather than sites) can be found around almost every corner. Even the urinal aside the old city wall is a sight to behold - I cannot believe how many pictures are taken of this, even some action shots! We walked it on two days. On the first day we took one of the old yellow trams part way up and strolled from there. On the second day we approached from the bottom on the riverside (which was probably more interesting). The vistas from the Castelo are superb as was the tour of the ramparts."

Codfish in particular is very famous in this region and all fish fishes are really very tasty.

At the highest point of the city, there are some spectacular views of the coast and all the buildings, it's really very pretty!

The taxis were the last resort when you just could not climb another set of stairs back up toward the apartment. Walking, actually climbing up streets that were never meant for vehicles is just part of the daily life for these locals. We were thankful to have an online map, we never found an information center with a good map. Once you get the hang of it, finding your way around isn't bad, just the steep streets! Great food options along every street. We used the mini-mercados to buy our food and cooked all our meals. \"Republica Portugal\" was a great Bistro not yet noted in TA for fresh juice drinks and other drinks and food items."

Started near the Castelo de Sao Jorge, which meant lots of steps just to get to the starting point but the views from there were worth it! Once we had (eventually!) found the start, we followed the guide and were rewarded with lots of quaint back alleys, passages, nice views and plenty more steps! Well worth a half day out if you are near that area to start with."

A Taxi to the top of the hill (Castle) from the pedestrian area by the arch and river cost us $7.

The best way to see the Alfama from here is to just Wander around ( a Map is Not necessary ) in the Knowledge that you Can't get Lost as any downhill Trek will Eventually take you to the River & the Baixa District.

You can meander through the tiny streets and even though you may think you are lost - you aren't because you know that your destination - the castle - is at the top - yes an uphill climb but so worth it! We did not pay the entrance fee to the castle, but had drinks at a patio overlooking city and water. Spectacular view!"

It's an old area of Lisbon and very hilly, expect to develop strong leg muscles. It has proved centrally located after you take the time to learn the team, bus and rail access systems and it has always offered great bars and restaurants nearby, a welcome relief after a full day exploring Lisbon."

You could actually walk here from the centre but most people take the tram, especially the number 28 which has now become so touristy it would be best to do it very early morning or maybe in the evening. You can lose yourself in the small streets, lots of places to eat, drink, shop or just take it all in. If you want to walk up to the Castillo it's very nice there also with some great views over the ocean, lots of artists and a great walk back down to central Lisbon."

I went there with a guide and don't think I would have given it any interest if I had not been given a most interesting talk about the area, it's people and information regarding its history - by this guide. I know it has many steps to climb if you come up from the port area but that is also part of its charm. We were encouraged to interact with the locals and take in the ambience of the area. I also had lunch in one of the local restaurants opposite where the cruise ships are docked. Very good food and most reasonable in price. Visiting this area was one of the benefits of being with a guide, who elaborated on its charm."

After one night, my parents wanted to leave the city.It's like the bad part of town that is getting gentrified and so is now trendy with the hipsters. Bleh."

Makes for some very good photography, keeps your eyes open and your heads up!We were lucky enough to wander around on a Tuesday, coinciding with the weekly flea market which is also the largest in Lisbon. You can find some hilarious things being sold as well as some very special antiques. Again, keep your eyes open and allow yourself a good hour or two to browse properly.

We were there during the sardine festival, and were able to sample street food, and hang out with locals. We came back again to shop the stores, filled with crafts from local artists. Very charming neighborhood."

Despite the fact you are in a large city, once you enter this ancient neighbourhood it feels like you have gone back in time to when neighbours were friendly and sincere. Over the centuries it has been home to groups that didn't fit into the regular Lisbon societies. These people are welcoming in a unique way. The streets are narrow and you will get lost. Look out for the dog poop everywhere. Stop and have conversations with the residents. Experience a place that is unlike any other."

Me and my friend started up at the Prato do sol view point where you can have great views of the whole city; the monastry churches, the sea and the main shopping district. I believe this area turns into a lively bar at night time too (we were there in the morning) . Despite being constantly warned by every guide book that we would get lost, we managed to navigate the cobbled streets, the winding alleys and the lack of sign posts! A tip would be to walk down the street named 'Helena' from Prato do sol and just work your way down. Walk down Sao Miguel and Sao Padro for the real Alfama atmosphere and you may even bump into the infamous Coco the parrot who will say 'ola' to you if you are lucky! As we walked along the streets we noticed several interesting religious murals on the brick work. Near the top of the district we stopped over at a vegan cage called Sao Tome. They served fresh, home made lemonade, vegan pizzas, cakes and other smoothies too. It was a lovely place to stop, with lovely, friendly staff and delicious food. We ended our self-directed tour at the fado museum and then walked along the water front to Rue Augusta again."

During evenings the streets are emptier and local people goes outside eating and talking each others in front of their buildings. I loved small local restaurants where police men and older men were waiting for a free table in front of the building. I recommend one of those tiny little restaurants, where you will sit on the same table with other guests - it is called O Eurico Casa de Pasto, own by two old people - husband and wife (great food, very good prices)"

We went around dinner time and the streets were incredibly lively. There was music everyone and people were dancing outside of all of the restaurants. It felt a little more authentic than other areas of Lisbon. The people were very very nice and accommodating. They were willing to talk to you and patient for those who do not speak Portuguese. Great experience."

We were immediately happy to see churros and other delicious street food for sale in a bustling historic section of the city. Walked around for hours, enjoyed it all, and were amazed to see that beer and sangria often cost less than coca cola (or even water!). But the big surprise was that June 12 happens to be a special holiday, and at night the place was just a joyous noisy mardi gras type party -- lots of people wearing green wigs and hats shaped like sardines (a very popular food in Lisbon!). It was just great fun to see and be part of -- totally different from most cities I've ever visited. So if you're planning a visit for next June, I suggest you time it for June 12!"

A tip, if the first one is full, wait for the next one and so on. There are many to choose from. No point in being sardined together when there are empty ones.

This is for sure one of the most charming parts, Lisbon has to offer, small winding roads, through ancient houses, which whisper history at every corner. Places definitely to visit:Castelo de S\u00e3o ,Decorative Arts Museum, the Miradouro de Santa Luzia and azulejo greja da Gra\u00e7a, a religious site of majestic proportions. You enjoy eating ... dare to have a look at those restaurants: For lunches Pois Caf\u00e9 does the trick with its light, healthy menu. For coffee and cake try Cruzes Credo. At Faz Figura, you can enjoy everything with a fantastic view, though at a higher price level. In case you're really in love with a panorama the Via Gra\u00e7a is your place.Otherwise - just stroll around, make a stop where it smells good - normally you want be disappointed.So why particularly June then ? It's party month in Alfama, the folks donors their holy personalities - everything is decorated and beautiful, music in all corners, sardines, beer and wine, when thinking of St. Antonio - more or less, at least. Otherwise the place as dedicated bars for great music. So Onda Jazz ,Clube de Fado and for local stuff A Ba\u00eeuca should be high up on your agenda.If you stay there a couple of days, have also fun in the flea market and visiting the national Pantheon - you earn yourself a memory for lifetime, I promise !"

Of course you can and should go up to the castle to have a nice view over Lisbon, but going up the hill from the riverside appears to be a-maze-ing. Small streets with, from time to time, really beautifully decorated tiny houses, with flowers and plants are simply rewarding you from the steep slopes you just walked. But the whole point of this walk is to get lost: the design of the street is oike a maze and this design dates back to the Maurs (who wanted plenty of small and complex streets so that their enemy is always in small number and not sure where to go). Well, this atmosphere is still living in this part of the city. So just get lost here: you'll find plenty of rewards on the way :)After all this walks, have a stop on your way back at Cruzes Credo (close to Se de Lisboa) to have a delicious chocolate cake.In the evening, te place is also very animated since you can find a lot of bars to have a drink, or also bars to listen to fado music."

I didn't know it was possible to have a village in the heart of a big city. People really still live there on the streets, there were orange trees with oranges fallen on the ground - and no one cleaned them. There were wandering dogs and no one cared, because they probably belong to someone everyone knows. I do recommend visiting, just go for a walk there without a goal to see a church or some house. Just breathe in the atmosphere."

Make sure that you buy a 24 hour transport pass for 6 E 'cause the trollies cost 3.75 E.

There was an ocean liner 'parked' nearby and we met two Brits who were off the ship passing the time in a nice little restaurant but can't remember the name! We also saw a local painter with a large display of oil paintings to sell, each one only costing EU8 or less. They were lovely so I bought two. If you walk further up the hill there are a few more painters at work. It's a very picturesque area and we noticed a nice restaurant situated down to the left of us near the river. We went back twice on the 28 tram as it was so pleasant."

Alfama is a beautiful, relaxing place to wander around and take in the lovely view of the Tagus River from several different vantage points. There are restaurants, pastry shops, souvenir shops, and convenience stores everywhere here. The streets are narrow and the pavement is very uneven, and the hills are a bit steep in places, so this is not the best destination for anyone who has difficulty with mobility. Those who are able to walk without difficulty should wear comfortable, sturdy shoes. I work out every day, but still get winded walking up some of these steeper hills, and there are many times I've lost my balance on an uneven pavement. (I do have mild asthma.) That being said, it is well worth the effort, especially if you take your time and stop in several places to browse around. The sense of history here is inspiring."

If you're planning to have lunch in Alfama - try Restaurante o Patrono (near Fado Museum); the serve grilled octopus for 11 euros with good house wine.Be aware of pickpocketing!!!

At some point they were behind us and we completely lost focus on them (even we had nothing in backpacks). Then one of the locals started yelling at them.

It is topped by the medieval Castelo of Sao Jorge which sits on the highest point in the area. As other reviewers have noted, the many roads can sometimes be steep, but exploring on foot is by far the best way to immerse yourself in this ancient part of the city. I would definitely recommend good hiking shoes or even boots. The cobblestone streets can get pretty slippery when wet.My wife and I stayed here on a recent business trip to the area. Our rental apartment was literally next door to the castle. A few hundreds yards from the castle entrance there are ancient Roman ruins that have been excavated. There are dozens of excellent restaurants as well. One of our favorite events was the Thieves Market that is held on Saturday and Tuesday. Flea markets around the world are all very similar. This one is not exception. We found many great bargains and really enjoyed seeing the variety of items for sale, all set in a district filled with ancient churches and buildings. Well worth taking the time to visit."

If you want to take a guided walking tour, check at the hostel in the main train station in downtown Lisbon (they are SO helpful) for times. The tours are free (although you would be a giant loser if you didn't give your guide a tip, and run daily. Or you can tour on your own. In either event, be prepared; you will be walking up and down some very steep hills! The beauty of the Alfama is how narrow the cobblestone streets are, and the beauty of the buildings. While much of Lisbon was rebuilt in the 1700's after the earthquake of 1755, the Alfama was spared the mass destruction, so you can see much of the original architecture. The only downside, which I suppose is true in most large cities, is the amount of trash to be seen on he streets. If you can't handle the walking, look into finding a tuk-tuk tour, which is a tour in what can only be described as a motorized rickshaw."

            "review": "Self guided walk in poor but REAL neighborhood (and not getting pick pocketed). Check out a DAY WALK and NIGHT STUMBLE in this neighborhood. Don't expect a groomed tourist attraction, you have to understand Alfama is POOR (many old folks in low cost small apartment in small dilapidated buildings) and old, but slooooowly upcoming at snail's pace. The average Lisbon salary at time of writing is 500 euro (a little over a third the average receptionist salary in Hongkong) and locals say unemployment is at 30%.Got to know the Alfama neighborhood by staying in small apartment on Rua dos Remedios, a week, on my own, and walked the infamously steep, rough and dirty cobblestone roads so much that broke 3 pairs of shoes and wrecked my luggage wheels! Its streets are downtrodden, run down maze, not for the casual tourist (and literally the well-heeled) but for people who want to see how locals REALLY live. Complete with overflowing garbage cans, dog poop, old ladies calling for their older sisters or husbands to let them into the apartment, laundry draped overhead and raw graffiti. Cute dogs wagging their tails to be petted and aloof cats draped from overhead balconies, unexpectedly sweet smiles from old ladies if you try to speak their lingo, amazing food at hole in the wall restaurants, soulful, live guitar playing pouring out from open windows. At night - Fado singing and guitar resonating through the maze streets at night and dirt cheap wine (paid 2.5 euro for what i thought was a glass and got a bottle! shared it and made friends very quickly). I avoided tourist traps like tram 28, and was safe, never a hint of pickpocket, even going out on my own as older woman all hours of day and night. The place is an overwhelming maze got happily lost in, but finally decided to make sense of it with a free online tour which if you dont wander off course and dive into restaurants and pasteis shops should take 1.5 to 2 hours.DAY SELF-TOURSo, iPhone set on on maps, check out http://www.lisbonlux.com/lisbon/alfama-walking-tour.html (my humble opinion against the advice of this site, DONT take tram 28 - not worth it) and start walking from St George Castle/Castelo do Sao Jorge or any easy-to-find vantage point along the tour such as Portas do Sol viewpoint, as you will get definitely get lost along the way. But that's part of the fun\u2026.You are basically heading down to the shore, southeastward.Lots of steep steps and streets, slippery cobblestones (fun fact - cobblestoning is a specialized job and there's even a union for it) so shoe accordingly. You'll pass a few un-notable and closed churches (Sao Miguel and Estavao), scenic outlooks, Manueline doorways, crumbling graffiti-ed fountains and a poignantly sad, beaten down Jewish quarter and tons of rundown,narrow winding streets -- this is a gritty behind the scenes tour. Your reward? Cool photos (checkout my lazy iPhone ones), glimpse into real life, some great pastry (pasteis), coffee and amazing hole in the wall restaurants. Stray off path now and then like I did and you'll pass some interesting old shops selling military gear (real and faux) and quaint but impractical clothing.If your starting point's the St George, turn left at the first intersection at the street leading down from castle exit and head downhill to Portas do Sol viewpoint about 8 minutes walk away. (Treasure hunt - keep your eyes peeled for a small Banksy-like graffiti along the way!!! Hint - its low on an unremarkable wall to the left of street) In case you cant find website, here is summary from the Portas do Sol. 2. Next to the terrace is a flight of steps which is Rua Norberto de Ara\u00fajo, taking you down the hill into the maze of streets. 3. Turn right at Cal\u00e7adinha da Figueira, where you'll see one of the towers of the church of S\u00e3o Miguel. 4. Go all the way down the stairs (Beco da Corvinha) to Largo de S\u00e3o Miguel(a). You'll see the side of the church and then a large palm tree(b) in front. I wandered off at this point into Santa Antonio Restaurant, Beco de Sao Miguel, crazy delicious fresh sea bass simply stuffed with lemon and coriander, grilled. And cheap wine! Great coffee! 5. Turn left towards Cal\u00e7adinha de S\u00e3o Miguel and you'll soon see the tower of the church of Santo Est\u00eav\u00e3o in the distance, but you'll turn left on the first alley, Beco da Cardosa. 6. At the very top of the stairs(a) you'll reach Rua Castelo Pic\u00e3o where you turn right and then right again to Beco das Cruzes(b), going down the steps and turning left, where you'll see the fa\u00e7ade of the church of Santo Est\u00eav\u00e3o(c). 7. At the end of the steps, turn left towards Largo do Peneireiro(a) where you'll turn right and go up the steps. At the top(b), turn right towards the church of Santo Est\u00eav\u00e3o.8. Next to the church is a terrace with river views. (Took photos of red roofs dotted with ugly soaring cranes - this is where u see changing face of Alfama) Go around the church, down the steps, where you'll see tiled houses. 9. Continue down, taking the steps Escadinhas/Cal\u00e7adinha de Santo Est\u00eav\u00e3o. At the bottom you'll see a tile panel indicating the old public baths, and turn left. At number 2 of Cal\u00e7adinha de Santo Est\u00eav\u00e3o you'll see a surviving Manueline doorway (16th century). NOTE!!! Somewhere between 9. and 11. is a crazy amazing pasteis shop with the most delicious Pastel de Nata egg tarts that's as good as the famed ones in Caf\u00e9 Past\u00e9is in Bel\u00e9m - sorry keep your eyes peeled I cant remember name or address. 10. You'll have reached Rua dos Rem\u00e9dios, turn right and go down the street where you'll see another Manueline doorway(a) on a small church before reaching Largo do Chafariz de Dentro(b). You may choose to visit the Fado Museum there, or continue heading northwest of the square, where you'll see tables outside a couple of restaurants(c). 11. Continue into Rua de S\u00e3o Pedro, go all the way down, passing through Fado restaurants and tourist shops before reaching Largo de S\u00e3o Rafael to the left. 12. Go down the hill at Largo de S\u00e3o Rafael and you'll see Rua da Judiaria, the center of the old Jewish quarter. You'll notice some surviving architectural details(a) and will see a fountain with an archway next to it(b). Go under the archway and you're suddenly out of the maze, close to the riverfront.13. Turn right towards the street and you'll eventually see a monumental 19th-century fountain which no longer provides water. Continue down the street and a few feet away is Campo das Cebolas with the archway Arco de Jesus to the right. 14. Go under the arch, up the steps by a tiled building, and at the top is Rua de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Pra\u00e7a, where you turn left. At number 95 is the popular Pois Caf\u00e9 for a refreshing drink or meal (there are more options ahead). 15. At the end of the street you'll see a tiled building(a) and the back of the medieval cathedral by orange trees(b). Going around the cathedral, up the hill again (Rua Augusto Rosa), you'll see souvenir and antique shops (between numbers 40 and 42 is also the entrance to the free Roman Theater Museum for the story of Roman Lisbon), and eventually you reach your starting point, the Portas do Sol viewpoint. At this point you may choose to relax and enjoy the view, or take tram 28 or walk following its tracks to the monastery of S\u00e3o Vicente de Fora or all the way to the Gra\u00e7a viewpoint.For other touristy sights in Alfama - visit Casa dos Bicos, the Church of St. Engr\u00e1cia, Fado Museum, Clube de Fado, Miradouro de Santa Luzia,Cathedral of Lisbon, Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio (commercial plaza for shopping). NIGHT STUMBLE OF RANDOM FADO HOUSES (after all that wine its a bit of a blurrr) Note - some Fado places only have 3-night/week performances so check before heading out. I found there wasn't much to do out at night in winter except restaurants, bars and Fado. Walk from the dilapidated plaza opposite the Fado Museum on Rua Jardim do Tabaco. Facing away the plaza, take the street at back right leading north (not rue dos remedies which heads east). Take the first left, first right and right again.to Parrreirinha De Alfama (Beco Espirito Santo 1, 1100-222 SANTO EST\u00caV\u00c3O). For more Fado options along Rua do Sao Pedro, head back toward the plaza, but head westward and within 3-10 minutes' walk you'll find several Fado bars which had much cheaper for food and wine and more local crowds, sorry cant remember their names. MORE about the Jewish history in Lisbon I found on a tour operator's site -- http://www.lisbonexplorer.com/jewish_lisbon.htmlThe Jews wielded great influence and power with Portuguese royalty and traders, and were a buffer between Muslims and Christians but were also victims of inquisitions, forced baptisms and massacres. Thousands of Jewish refugees escaped Nazis through Lisbon, including artist Marc Chagall."

It can be a little touristy, but there are good restaurants to be found that cater to the locals. Head for those. Just enjoy a leisurely stroll through the twisting Alfama streets.

Close to the Lisbon waterfront, the old district of Alfama in Lisbon, Portugal, is famous for its narrow streets and alleys, its bars and cafes, its Moorish history but above all for its great music tradition known as Fado. Fado(fate) is sung music of great longing, sorrow and even romance accompanied by the Portugese guitarra and sung passionately by both men and women some of whom are world famous. This area was built by the Moors and still retains that crowed look of an intimate kasbah.. There is a Fado museum and this Alfama district acttually survived the destruction of the great Lisbon earthquake, tsunami and fires of 1755. The Alfama is dotted with many Fado cafes such as Sao Miguel D'Alfama (featured Fado chanteuse Fatima Mouro) and Restaurante Esquina De Alfama. Tourists should be aware that almost all of Lisbon is very hilly and walking up and down in the Alfama takes some effort. The Alfama also houses many gift and antique shops. The Alfama is always on the many offered Lisbon city tours and some tours bring you to the Alfama at night to dine and listen to Fado music. Enjoy the Alfama, the wonderful Fado music and sip some vinho verde."

It was built long before there was something like a motor car, and as such it is a series of alleys and narrow winding streets most of which cannot be navigated by today's transportation vehicles. Therefore, the first thing that the visitor must equip himself with is a pair of strong legs, because I don't believe you can properly visit Alfama any way other than by walking. However, as Alfama is built on a high hill, it would probably be worth the while of the visitor to take some kind of transportation up to the top, and from there work down (I have climbed from the bottom up, and believe me I regret it) by foot. As you can read in other reviews, Alfama is a very colorful and authentic neighborhood, filled with dwellings that must have existed for centuries. In addition to residences, there are restaurants, shops, and tourist attractions (clubs, and Fado venues). And because it is on a high hill, there are many panoramic views of the city and the river below. Of course it wouldn't be Portugal if it wasn't also filled with churches, beautiful churches, monuments to the deity and testimony to the faith of the people. I cannot imagine someone visiting Lisbon without visiting Alfama"

            "review": "Why you should choose Alfama. The weight of HistoryAlfama is the proud survivor of Arabic and medieval Lisbon and it's arguably the city's oldest quarter. Battered by the 1755 earthquake that devastated the city, Alfama stayed out of the Marquis of Pombal's revolutionary urban plan to rebuild the capital, shaping what is now Downtown Lisbon. Alfama's buildings were rebuilt essentially following the pre-earthquake urban layout, its narrow winding streets, some of them just flights of stairs, in steep contrast with the wide, straight streets of the town's newer areas.Alfama neighbourhood sprawls up Castle Hill, between Lisbon harbour and the uptown. This proximity to the river shaped Alfama's people and activity. Traditionally populated by fishermen, fishmongers and people dedicated to most activities related to fish trade, it was Alfama that provided most of the sailors for the Portuguese ships that sailed from Lisbon to discover the World in the 14th and 15th centuries. It was also from here that came most of Lisbon harbour's workers, either as dockers or shipyard workers.Thousands of stories of women left ashore while their loved ones sailed to an uncertain destiny, of sailors dreaming of their loved ones waiting for them at home, paired with stories of betrayal and death, but also of partying, religious devotion and passion for Lisbon, have set the theme throughout the years for the lyrics of Portugal's national song, the 'Fado' (literally, Fate), UNESCO Immaterial World Heritage. Reason enough for Alfama to house the Museum of Fado.The weight of traditionAlfama is probably the only of Lisbon's quarters that has best preserved tradition and the essence of being a Lisboner: friendly, easy going, hard working people, with a fiery temperament, where the concept of \"neighbours\" and \"family\" are mixed, yet surprisingly open and unprejudiced.Alfama is at its peak in June, during the Saints Celebrations, particularly on the 12th and 13th of June, when Saint Anthony of Lisbon is celebrated (and yes, this is the right designation of the incorrectly named Saint Anthony of Padova). The neighbours organise street parties, the smell of barbecued sardines, barbecued pork and roasted chouri\u00e7o fills the air, wine and beer flow freely, there's music and dancing and hoards of tourists and Lisboners invade the place to enjoy the action. And in the small hours of the morning comes the result of Lisbon's Marches competition that gathers all the 30 or so Lisbon quarters in a fierce contest for which Alfama is always the favourite to win (and it did, 8 times in the past 10 years). The chances of the party turning to a victory celebration are high.Discovery around every cornerAlfama is a maze of narrow streets, alleys, flights of stairs, where it's a pleasure to get lost, as you may accidentally discover that particular corner, or small restaurant, or amazing view, or even someone to chat that can make your day.There isn't a must see itinerary in Alfama. The two most commonly used ways to enter the quarter are from Portas do Sol, coming down from the Castle, or from Rua das Cruzes da S\u00e9, a street going along the cathedral's left hand side (South side, I suppose).The approach through Rua das Cruzes da S\u00e9 is my favourite: as you face the cathedral's main entrance, you'll see a street on the left going up towards the Castle (this is where the popular tram 28 goes) and another on the right, which is the one you should take. It's straight ahead to Alfama (keep left when in doubt), through a cute street with orange trees on one side and nice caf\u00e9s on the other side. The river is to your right and the Castle is to your left; have this in mind, as this will be your two reference points when entering Alfama.Further ahead, Cruzes da S\u00e9 changes to Rua S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Pra\u00e7a. Carry on until you reach a small square; 50 meters ahead, slightly hidden on the right at Travessa do Chafariz d'El Rei, you can visit the spectacular Palacete do Chafariz d'El Rei (King's Fountain Palace), now a hotel and amazing tea room. If you prefer to skip this (don't!) Alfama is just a few meters ahead.Once you're in Alfama you'll be sort of 'on your own'. My suggestion is that you let yourself wander along the streets, avoiding going to far upwards (towards the Castle) or to far downwards (towards the river). These are your only two reference points in Alfama's maze.Things you may want to see in Alfama are:- the museum of Fado- the fish market, specially on week days, in the morning- the extremely narrow street, now a flight of stairs squeezed between two buildings that were separated by the 1755 earthquake, where only one person fits at a time (find it!)- the Palacete do Chafariz d'El Rei, which I mentioned earlier;- the Memmo Alfama Hotel bar, with a spectacular view over Alfama, the river and beyondMagicalAt night, Alfama doubles its magic. The gently lit streets get a nostalgic atmosphere and the fado that can be heard from the small restaurants almost everywhere just adds to that. Lisboners usually associate Alfama to \"fado for tourists\" and they are partially right. In recent years, however, Alfama has been hosting a fair share of trendy bars, which are improving the quarter's offer on what nightlife is concerned. This hasn't been enough to attract the crowds of Bairro Alto, which is good, as Alfama remains much safer, clean and magical than the Bairro.So, yes, if I was you, I wouldn't overlook Alfama and would dedicate at least half a day to it. Hope you enjoy it, at least as much as I do."

Saturday flea market is a must if you like flea markets.Castelo S.Jorge and Cathedral are also within easy walking distance from anywhere in Alfama. Baixa is cca 10 to 15 minute walk from the centre of Alfama.The area can look run down and derelict at times, but as we understood the impact of salt and wind is such that no building covering can endure for more than a few decades before it looks like it will colapse (hence tiles on the walls although they are too expensive nowdays).The only thing you have to keep in mind if staying in Alfama is that the neighbourhood is quite loud so if you have light sleep like me you may end up not having too much sleep (which can get irritating at times), but if you have not problems with it I would recomend staying in Alfama."

I had read to start at the top and work my way down since it is on steep hills. I started from the bottom and unless you are in amazing shape I would refrain from doing this or walking it. The stone is also uneven and quite slick even when dry.I walked so that I could take it in and also photograph it's character. There are so many alley ways with character, crumbling buildings and laundry hanging between the buildings. If you do start at the bottom and cannot walk it take a Tuk Tuk! They give cheap 30min+ tours and stop at the sights up the hill. I did this half way up and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's an informal guide and they can tell you all about the history of the attractions and also stop off at other spots if you want other photos. It was 30euros for 30min. It's also fun to scoot around in these and take it all in. You could also take the famous Tram up as well, but these seemed packed and you do not get the personal attention but it is a more economical way of seeing the sights. I went towards sundown and very glad I did as I caught views with an amazing skyline and it was much cooler out.This is part of why I started at the bottom. I recommend early AM or late afternoon to beat the heat and the crowds but it is a must see!"

How about really old streets going up and down on a hill (they are many centuries old, some are crumbling, some are pretty, some streets are very narrow, and some are steep, so it does feel authentic), plenty of restaurants serving actually good and cheap food and drinks and if you want something uniquely Portuguese - what can be more Portuguese than fado music (frankly, i'm not going to listen it while driving in a car any time soon, but if you happen to be there, why not)?Basically, there are really no good excuses, so you pretty much gotta go and check that place out. Ok, a few practical advices.First of all, the old town itself is beautiful, so it's totally fine just to walk around. Ladies, no heels or you will be sorry - it's cobblestone on steep slopes everywhere. Second, the food. There are two popular formats - a la carte where you pick what ever you like and, for the places with fado music, they commonly ask for a fixed priced pre fixed meal. Ask upfront and make sure you like the set. I don't eat pork and beef and it pretty much ruled out most of the meals. And, finally, most of the places do not accept credit cards. So bring some cash with you. It will also help if you decide to buy a flower or a song for your lady - there are a lot of bands and vendors offering their services around the tables.Enjoy your visit!"

This is the most beautiful! ; Oh, yes! This is the most exciting!; Oh, yes! This is the most interesting place of it-, till I went to Aflama.First we got on the tram 28 and from there we could see the Lisbon Cathedral. We found that it is definitely deserves a stop and some investigation. Unluckily the original cathedral from the 13th century was mostly destroyed by the earthquake in 1755. After it was partially rebuild and thanks to the latest renovation it is a beautiful old church again, even if we know, that mostly it isn't that old as it looks like.Our next stop was the Miradouro de Santa Luzia .From there I had the view over Alfama till the Tagus River. Now we were ready for a proper , face to face visit.When we started to walk around I felt, that I just found the part of Lisbon, I was always looking for. The spirit of this old suburb was so overwhelmingly strong and exquisite, that I just wanted to stay and stay and see more and more of it, or just sit in a little shabby coffee shop and watch the life going around me. If I\u2019ll be lucky enough to go back to Lisbon for the third time, this will be the place I\u2019ll revisit for sure. shabby coffee shop and watch the life going around me.

I'd walk out on the narrow, hilly, and winding streets and watch women sweeping dirt off the pavements in front of their house with straw brooms..or marvel at the colourful clothes hanging on clothes lines outside windows.Towards the evening I'd watch the old lady in the small shop across the lane sit outside and keep tabs on the comings and goings of the folks in the neighbourhood, and happily chatting with the customers coming in the shop, or regular faces from the 'hood. I'd delight in the wide grin of an elderly gentleman who seemed escatitic of the sale he made to me in his tiny closet of a shop on a side street.Later I'd walk up the steep hill - almost grazing by a passing streetcar - to a small hillside lookout overlooking the city and bay of Lisbon and the Castle of S.Jorge and watch the gorgeous sunset.Finally at night I'd pass by the small cafes and hear diners singing along with entertainers playing music fado style well into the night.

You could easily spend half a day roaming the narrow cobblestone streets, some so narrow you they were more like a sidewalk. When we stopped for a beer at a tiny caf\u00e9 (literally like a hole in the wall) the people were friendly and everything was cheaper than anywhere else in Lisbon. The roads are a maze but you can't get too lost because you can usually see where the ocean is at the bottom and find your way back to the central Commercial Plaza. Our experience here balanced a negative impression of the Restauradores area where they actively fleece tourists."

If you don't feel like walking, take tram 28 through the Alfama. A journey on the old wooden tram up the narrow, steep streets is an experience in itself! It wasn't particularly busy, being out of season, and as such it did not feel too touristy. It's also a nice walk up through the Alfama, to the Castel S.Jorge, which is equally worth a visit."

The flea market that is held every Tuesday and Saturday is a must see when you are in this area. People are selling everything and its always bustling and a lovely way to spend a couple of hours. The market is also held around National Pantheon and S\u00e3o Vicente de Fora Church which are worth seeing. It's also easy to walk over to the Sao Jorge Castle from Alfama. The only problem we had in this area was with the amount of dogs dirt on the pavements.

            "review": "Delicious romp through this marvellous ethnic district. Looking around us,its difficult to swallow the idea that this 'hood was the most desirable quarter in Lisbon,many aeons ago. Sure,i can appreciate the fact that fear of earthquakes in the Middle Ages saw the rich folk desert this quarter to make way for fishermen and paupers. So let's skip to the latter part of the 20th century and explore the Kasbah-like layout which is still evident around here. Compact houses line steep streets and stairways,their windows strung with washing. Be that as it may, daily life still revolves around grocery stores and the fabulous small,cellar-like tavernas. There is an antique tram that runs through parts of this district,but its in the afternoon that the joint starts jumping,coming to life when the locals like gophers emerge out of their doorways and start filling the tavernas. Given the steepness of the streets and the steps,the trick is to start at the top and work your way down. A walk around the maze of winding alleyways will reveal picturesque corners and crumbling facades of houses,churches as well as,panoramic views from shady terraces,such as the Miradouro de Santa Luzia. I like to stop on the large Das portas do Sol,for a coffee and those divine pastries and look over the rooftops to the Tagus estuary. This converted rooftop is a pit-stop essential for your survival. Drop down a street and check out the Museu de Artes Decorativas to see the superb craftsmanship of the 17th and 18th century Portuguese furniture and decorative arts. Its also a marker of the of the styles inherent in the textiles,silver,ceramics as well as,furniture,all housed in a handsome mansion,the Palacio Espirito Santo Silva,inside of which are rich examples of gaming tables,silver collections and Chinese ceramics. In the adjoining building live artisans demonstrate their expertise in cabinet-making,book- binding,gilding and traditional crafts. Fascinating place. Keep heading downwards and you spot the stalls of the Thieves market, in a shady haven,laid-out under the canopy of trees. If you are a bargain-hunter,forget finding a gem among the bric-a brac, however your in luck if you are into wrought iron work,tiles,prints and second hand clothes. What i became aware of was how much was out of Africa....masks,statuary and jewellery . There is a good fish and veggie and herb market. Its lively and engaging. One of Lisbon's most striking landmarks,the soaring dome of Santa Engrecia punctuates the skyline,famous for taking a long time to get built....from 1681 to 1966. the interior is paved with coloured marble and has a giant cupola. Take the lift up to the dome to see a 360 degree panorama of the city. great for orienting yourself."

The neighbourhood is not for those who have difficulty with stairs or hills! There is a lot of walking.

This crowded alley ridden part of the city centre is an experience which must be witnessed if visiting Lisbon. I started my walk from the station and just took the path along the harbour into the heart of Alfama. It\u2019s impressive to look into the town from the harbour because you realise how steep and hilly the town of Alfama is. A word of caution, there are plain clothes locals that will approach you selling \u2018weed\u2019 so keep your wits about you, especially if you\u2019ve got bags etc. This town has a fair amount of poor people littered around and more prominent as you make the climb into the Alfama towards the Castle. There is the odd street \u2018Del boys\u2019 selling glasses, I\u2019d stay clear of them or anything they have to offer. Keep a careful eye out, as when we started walking up towards the castle, the alleys become narrow and it\u2019s easy to get lost in the maze of paths which can be ideal for a thief to target you. Follow the crowd and make sure you\u2019re around people as you walk in and around the Alfama. This shouldn't deter you but rather instil your \u2018street senses\u2019 as you would any other part of the world. There are cafes dotted around Alfama, but the whole point of navigating your way in and around Alfama is just to freestyle. Meaning no maps, just walk wherever you want and once you\u2019ve decided to go to the castle, the only way is up \u2013 so hardly any room to get lost. I went on a sunny Saturday and the general attitude is very lazy, which is nice to roam around without large groups of people.There\u2019s not anything you have to see or do, I guess it\u2019s just an experience so be sure to enjoy it. There\u2019s a nice open area called \u2018Praca do Comercio\u2019 which has steps that lower into the sea, a nice place to chill and relax. Pictures below, enjoy and embrace the culture."

Miradours covered in broken glass, overgrown with weeds, crumbling modern concrete walls, rubbish piled up, everything covered in graffiiti (as are most things in Lisbon from what we saw), lethal paths (another Lisbon trait). Aside from some nice views out of the river and rooftops from \"THAT\" spot, what's all the fuss about Alfama from a tourist's point of view? Maybe it's the alleys that offer endless opportunities to take the drugs that are constantly being offered as there was plenty of evidence on the floors (admittedly a wordwide phenomenon)?! I realise that the people have had it tough in Portugal these past 6 years but if Alfama is being touted as \"an authentic Lisbon community\" then why doesn't this community help itself out and clean itself up a bit?  Despite most of the people we spoke to being friendly enough We were left with the impression that the local people don't have much interest in tourism as they realise that the profits being generated are not finding their way back to their own area. I write this as someone who has lived in one of the most economically deprived areas of Europe for the last 30 years and has seen how far an area can fall if its people lose heart following economic decimation. The difference being that my area never had an established tourism sector to fall back on."

Our guide was sensitive to the diverse \"fitness levels\" of the group and paced the tour accordingly. As much of Lisbon's oldest quarters are built on the slopes of the castle mound this was greatly appreciated. The Alfama is one such district. A labyrinth of narrow paved laneways and tiny cobbled courtyards hidden behind the enclosing walls of multi storeyed apartment buildings. Doorways open right onto the street, washing flaps from lines strung down from windows and balconies, and stairways that disappear under archways and wind down the steep sides the hill. A picturesque medieval streetscape through which to wander and lose track of time."

It is one of the oldest constantly inhabited neighborhoods in the city, and its name comes from the Moorish times, before 1147. Having said this it is not touristy, which is great. You won't see immaculate streets filled with cheap memorabilia stores. This is a living neighborhood, people live here as they have for many years particularly because most inhabitants are seniors. Things have begun to change, bringing fancier stores and younger people and while progress is great some of the character of the neighborhood will change forever. If you think everything that I have said is ridiculous, don't go. You won't like it. If you want to see something old and beautiful, that was not created for tourist consumption but has an appeal like few neighborhoods in European capitals have, then come and get lost. Literally. Ditch your map and wander, keep going up the gradient and you will find the castle. The small corners, hidden stairs and small plazas are why this place is unique. Lisbon at its most special and truest self, a slightly decaying, maze-like and hilly ride that affords great views and a peak to the past of something that never was."

In the morning, I can hear it come to life when everyone starts to wake up and open their business. You can easily get lost here but just as easily find your way again and not be bothered by not having a map. It's a bit steep and a little dirty but I guess that's part of its charm.

We had been advised already by friends hence we were prepared. It was a lovely day not very hot. Alfama is part of the old Lisbon and the narrow streets. You see how really portugese people live and the conversations they have across the windows. The retired men playing cards etc. Easy to get lost in the small streets but if you have time take it slowly and enjoy. As we were short of time we took a 3 hours guided tour. Visit bakeries and small restaurants on the way.Come back down by tram."

The area is the oldest part in Lisbon and you'll see there some houses that are older than the earthquake that hit the city in 1755. As you step into Alfama's narrow winding alleys you'll feel that you've stepped out of time to another era. I don't think it's possible to take a walk there alone unless you plan on getting lost. If you're not with a local guide or someone who knows the area, then don't attempt to enter this maze on your own unless you plan on spending the whole day there. It will be a wonderful day no doubt, but you may just find it quite a challenge to find your way back on your own - unless of course you plan to stay there, which is not a bad idea at all :)Alfama is one of the places that made me fall in love with Lisbon."

We did a general coach tour around Lisbon when we first arrived and decided that we wanted to look more closely at the historical area of Alfama and glad we did. We took and ride in a 'tuk tuk' which was ideal for getting around the small historical streets. The ride was a little bumpy but got to see an awful lot of the fascinating quarter of Alfama. We were able to stop next to many historical buildings - The 18th century church of Santa Luzia - The Fa\u00e7ade of the Se, the cities main cathedral and the labyrinth of alleyways which spill out onto open air patios. The Tuk Tuk tour takes from 1 hour to 3 hours which will take you round the whole city of Lisbon if you want - do ask to stop off for photo opportunities and cost around 35 to 55 euros. The area gives you many Historical buildings, Museums, Galleries, Markets, Restaurant's, Churches and Belvederes. Have a great time, we did."

They pose as tourists and work in groups. One person spots potential marks by observing what you have (cell phones in particular) and where you keep it. They then give the information by phone to two others who will follow you until you reach a vulnerable spot. Zip up any bag, pocket, etc. Always. My wife was robbed in September 2013. We went back a few days later to spot the criminals and photograph them so that we could warn other. The attached photos are of pickpockets that work in Alfama, near Castelo de Sao Jorge and the Miradoro de Santa Luzia. The one on the phone is the spotter. The three men walking are the pickpockets who follow you and strike when your attention is diverted. They dressed exactly the same way both the day that they robbed us and a few days later. After they steal your phone, they hide it in their back pockets -- you can even see bulges in one of the photos. I've already given these photos to the Lisbon police, but only you can protect yourself from being robbed in the first place. Please share these photos with whomever is going to this area."

            "review": "History lives. Whenever I have friends visiting for the first time, I take them to my favorite Lisbon tour: Take the #28 Tram (you catch it three streets in from Praca do Comercio. Make sure you turn left as you hit the correct street, so that you get on at an earlier stop, rather than later, since the tram fills up VERY quickly). Several years ago, the Castle started charging an entrance fee in to the grounds, which I wholly disapprove of since this is an open space that has traditionally belonged to everyone. Some tourist spots should be free, and this is one of them. However, if you don't mind paying, the line moves quicker than you might imagine. If you DO mind paying, there is a Chinese restaurant nearby with excellent views of the city, too (but it really isn't quite the same!). In any case, the Castelo is a great starting point for a leisurely walk down through Lisbon's oldest quarter, the Alfama, with its cobbled streets, cable cars, narrow alleys, and many attractions, including the 12th Century Cathedral, or \"Se\". Walking along these streets, the modern world dissolves in a haze of picturesque beauty, blending the 17th and 19th centuries, as gorgeous old cable cars glide up and down cobbled streets, passing cool alleyways, above which hang wrought-iron balconies, festooned with plants. Everywhere you look is a poster shot waiting for your camera, but there is no greater pleasure than to simply wander and enjoy this ancient hill of Lisbon, keeping your electronic devices in your pocket, as you capture the moments with those far more sensitive devices, your mind and heart."

Was particularly interested in Lisbons Moorish history and so, as one might expect, the Alfama district was on our list of must sees. What an ugly experience we had! Headed up on the No 28 tram, full to bursting with tourists. An extremely clever robbery then took place on said tram, whereby we were 280 Euros poorer by the time we'd reached the castle! This robbery was perfectly executed by at least three men and an old woman. The old woman was standing at the side of the tram driver and as the bus was so crowded I thought she was being kind when she moved aside a little in order to make space for me. Wrong! This was done to subtly separate me from my husband who was then equally subtly surrounded by three men. Even though he had a zipped wallet attached to his front jeans pocket by a chain (this wasn't obvious to the eye), he was jostled by the men during the trams jerking movements but was unaware that they'd expertly removed the wallet from his pocket, unzipped it and removed every one last note. We were left with nothing. We had to walk for ages until we found a police station whose police officers almost yawned as they listened to our account of what had taken place. We spoke to several locals during the course of our week in Lisbon and were repeatedly told that tram 28 is a notorious pickpocket venue, the thieving gangs being known to police but that nothing was ever done to address the problem. We were informed that thieving gangs were rampant throughout Lisbon but that the Alfama area was particularly bad. Reading through Trip Advisor entries headed 'crime in Lisbon' or '28 tram Lisbon' etc one can see how serious a problem this is. My husband and I have travelled the world and realise that one finds crime against tourists everywhere. Our experience has shown us however, that crime is taken more seriously in some countries. Lisbon, including the Alfama area, really does need to get a grip on this. Locals informed us that the tram drivers, some restaurant owners and even the police were a part of the problem. Our own observations would support this view. Another thing which disappointed us immensely was that nowhere in the castle or the Amalfa area was there any public recognition or information of the centuries of Moors' rule. At best, there was an odd sentence making reference to it. Perhaps more might have been gained in this respect by being part of a tour. Who knows. One was left with the impression however that Portugals Moorish past was deliberately kept low key. The entry charge to the castle was in our opinion not worth paying unless you don't mind wandering aimlessly around the walls and admiring the view ( these same views can be enjoyed for free elsewhere). Even the cafe's inside the castle walls are nothing but overpriced tourist traps...junk food , plastic tables, pigeons pooing and eating off plates. Dreadful experience. I would strongly advise you to seek out the knowledge of a reputable local guide should you be really interested in the local history and not just meandering aimlessly around the streets. Using the services of a reputable local guide may well offer you a little protection from the local thieves too, although I wouldn't bank on it. Please, before travelling to Lisbon, do read the numerous accounts written on Trip Advisor and other sites on the serious, and rapidly increasing incidents of crime against tourists. We've been shocked by our own experience as well as by the experience of others. Lisbon really does need to address this problem seriously otherwise people, like us, will choose never to return."

The second was to visit the Saturday flea market. My first attempt at taking the Metro failed and I ended up at the wrong stop. I then tried to take the bus up, but got off too soon. I should have just taken the trolley again, but I wanted to try something new. I ended up walking up to Alfama and the flea market. Part of me was glad I did. I walked through some very tiny streets with mom and pop shops and restaurants throughout- great deals! I really got the feel of what a traditional Portuguese neighborhood is like. Once you get to the top the views made the hills worthwhile."

But be sure you sit down near window! What I found nice about Alfama is that you can get lost there but you will always find your way out! The buildings are astonishing. And if you go there quite early you will not see many tourists - just people eating their breakfasts somewhere in the nice caffeterias."

It's the oldest section of Lisbon and the multiple narrow twisting streets and alleys prove mysterious as well as historical. Of course the castle is there, worth a visit, as well as the many shops sprinkled on every street. We were told not to walk around at night in Alfama, so we didn't - but during the day we never felt nervous."

Taking a metro to arrive to Santa Apolonia, we just went uphill and found out a wonderful surprise - it was the last hour of Feira da Ladra flee market and it was absolutely amazing! So many things you see and the atmosphere was great! Funny stuff offered along real antiquities. Churches were mainly already closed but the famous Se cathedral was open. Orange trees, Jasmine trees...I cant describe the nice smell coming from them. We like walking uphill, coming from an alpine country so we took the famous tram 28 upon our way down to visit Castelo Sao Jorge. We came during the daylight and stayed until it was completely dark. Spectacular views are provided and you'll enjoy the company of several peacocks. They yell all the time so you hear them wherever you move. Nice. I'm not sure if there are more peacocks or cats. If you doubt if it's worth visiting - dont. An absolute must for everyone. Nearby is an original souvenirs shop called \"A Arte da Terra\" and it happened for the first time on our trips that we bought souvenirs the very first day :))And another thing: we stayed for 9 days, being outside all the time, driving ferries, trams, busses, metros even a helicopter. But nobody robbed us or tried to sell us drugs. Special regards to Mafalda, who escorts us to Baixa-Chiado metro station and to her friend from Uruguay, who sadly we dont remember the name."

Alfama is a charming neighborhood of hills and zig-zagging narrow streets past old houses with their wash hung out to dry. Main streets are plagued by the touristy shops that sell postcards and little cockerel magnets, but just keep going. There are several gorgeous churches here: we saw the Madalena, the St. Anthony and the Se, or Cathedral (we tried without success to find out which of the two bell towers was the one an angry crowd threw the Spanish bishop out of during a war with Spain). Keep going up...there is a wonderul miradouro (view) across from the Museum of Decorative Arts. Somewhere (we never found it) is the remains of a Roman theater. Then, finally, at the top, you find (no signage! keep asking people!) St. George's Castle. You can walk along the walls and check out the great views. There isn't much in the way of interior space (except a cafe and restaurant) but there are peacocks and if you are lucky one will display. Then it's back down, by foot or tram. At the bottom somewhere is the Fado Museum but we skipped that and decided to go to a fado concern instead."

Running down from the Castelo Sao Jorge to the banks of the Tagus, this tortuous and colourful district epitomizes what makes Lisbon such an attractive city. Steps replace vertical streets at many places, and passageways burrow between and even through the houses of the local inhabitants. In one of its larger squares, the Museum of Fado is to be found. The Cathedral doesn't enjoy such good fortune and is squeezed out by the surrounding buildings. The Museum of Decorative Art, the lovely Mirador of Santa Luiza, and several churches are embedded within its boundaries. But even without any of these highlights, the district still holds terrific charm arising from its quaint shops, bars and restuarants, a high proportion of which offer entertainment ( predominantly Fado ) with dinner. The emblematic Lisbon tramcar threads its way onwards and upwards. Multicoloured washing hangs between the sides of the narrower streets, and the smells of wine and food stimulate thirst and appetite. A poorer, down to earth area, but no slum, and with a charm and dignity all its own, Alfama deserves to be savoured by any visitor anxious to acquire and take away haunting memories of the authentic city and its kindly, honest, working people."

You find lots of little craft shops and tiny bars on the way into Alfama.It is an excelelnt location for photographers as there are beautiful views and interesting architecture at every turn in the winding roads. The decorative trams set against the old town buildings make colourful pics. Stop for a glass of wine to rest those tiring feet, at just 1 euro a glass and you can watch the world go by while writing those postcards home!"

Just steps from the main attractions, it was just amazing getting lost into those tiny little streets and getting to see lisboetas in their original setting. Plus, you can never imagine the places you can discover in that labyrinth-like district. Either restaurants, either fado houses, either nice little bars or alternative little stores, you name it, it's all here! Just adored it!"

Metro Stop : Martim Moniz. Look for the Lisbon famous Tram 28. ( if you buy the 1 days pass of Metro, you could use it for tram 28 FREE )We took the Tram 28 ( beware of pickpockets) admiring all the narrow streets with wonderful buildings decorated with the tiles, cobbled alleys twisting all the way uphills. We went straight to Castelo de Sao Jorge early morning. Enjoy the absolutely money well worth scenery up at castle, then we had lunch right opposite the castle. Wonder down the areas consists of Alfama, Graca and Castelo and enjoy the scenery of moorish buildings, typical daily life Lisbon ie clothings hanging out, great pictures takings everywhere, infront of the Church SE, sloping downhill, one of the best spots to wait for the tram 28 to curve up or curve down infront of SE for a superb snapshots.Lots of souvenirs shops along the way. We walked all the way down to Baixa / praca do comercio areaa and took us almost whole day for this trip from 1st tram ride up to castle."

It comprises the neighborhoods named Frequesias of S\u00e3o Miguel, Santo Est\u00eav\u00e3o e S\u00e3o Vicente de Fora. The word Alfama derives from the Arabic al-hamma which means baths or fountains and Alfama\u2019s water comes from a group of mineral and medicinal springs associated with a geological failure that throughout history were piped to feed its fountains. Alfama is a tangle of narrow slopes, with clothes strung ropes hanging from the windows, adorned apartments, houses of fado and streetcars. You can walk up and down admiring the cable cars full of tourists from worldwide.Walking up and down the cobblestone streets can be very tiring if you are not a fit person. Go with a guided group to avoid pitfalls. It's easy to get lost and be fooled by someone malicious.If you are not familiar with the region avoid walking there at night.What is a must in the region:. Mr. Fado restaurant. Rua dos Remedios 176.. Santo Antonio de Alfama restaurant. St. Michael Alley 7.. Crafts shops.. The facades of old tiles.. The Fado museum."

We had great experiences with places where the grandma was cooking in the kitchen and came out to make sure, the food was to our liking.We lived in a small back alley, where an old lady would greet us in the morning when we left.Alfama shows the warmth and hospitality of the Portugues people."

We had downloaded half a dozen self-guided walks from the Lisbon Tourist Office prior to our trip to the city, and the Alfama walk was the first one we attempted. Alfama was also the area that we were most keen to visit in Lisbon and the one I had heard so much about.We started at the Martim Moniz metro station and soon started our climb up to the pretty Mouraria district.The narrow, stepped streets and cobbled alleyways were wonderfully picturesque with washing draped across between the houses and bouganvillea tumbling over the walls.Alfama itself was much busier and teeming with tourists. We decided against visiting the castle, as neither of us could face the long queues at the ticket office. I hope we didn't miss anything, apart from a wonderful view over the city, but we came across so many lovely viewpoints during our visit it didn't really matter that we didn't see them all. There were some tempting looking little restaurants in the area that I wished we'd sampled during our stay, however we had covered so many miles on foot during the day that Alfama was too far to attempt twice in aday. I had read in some guidebooks that the area was dangerous after dark which would be a great pity if true. I always find it strange that an area so lovely on a hot and sunny day could transform itself into somewhere threatening in the evening."

This fact alone can probably tell you how good the place is. Warm, outgoing people with a smile always ready for you - just give them a smile, and you get such a warm one in return!Lots of cafes and restaurants. Some are close to the trodden paths and cater for tourists (which inevitably affects the price range). Others are deeper inside the maze of the narrow streets, and are much more affordable. (Keep in mind that part of the price is the Fado cover price.)Alfama is one big family. They do not lock their doors, people living there know each other, so being an Alfama inhabitant imposes a certain code of behavior that looks unusual, even inexplicable at times. But it is there, and you can notice it if you know what to look at. And you need to see how seriously the locals take themselves!Trams running through Alfama make it easy to reach other sections of the city. And once you get a good idea of the lay of the land you can actually reach any spot in Alfama within 15 minutes on foot (but you need strong legs and good non-slipping walking shoes!).Some criminology is due. we were bracing ourselves for a life full of dangers. We encountered a fairly safe environment - no-one tried to rob us, we did not get mugged (and yes, we did walk around at night a bit!), no-one broke into the apartment, and nothing got stolen. We did not even meet a real pickpocket on the #28 tram. Maybe they were all on vacation as well, as the summer was over. :)Bottom line: if your \"ideal destination\" is a five-star hotel, Alfama is probably not for you. If you can enjoy living in a fairly run-down, somewhat dilapidated area with a character - give it a try!"

My advice is first make sure to take your camera, then take the most famous Tram 28 at the very first station Pra\u00e7a Martim Moniz to find a seat next to window. Lean back on the wooden retro tram chair and enjoy the surroundings. Eventually, leave the tram somewhere above, say at the Castle or nearby. Actually, your time travel has already started as you stepped into the tram, but take it even more past by wandering downhill to the narrow streets of Alfama. For the most authentic experience get lost within the narrow alleys, smell the history and breath the nostalgic air. Make this trip during the daylight and also see Alfama during the night, the latter is absolutely more gorgeous, more alive and even more magical."

It\u2019s rather \u2018oriented\u2019 towards the tourist, but that\u2019s what you would expect, so be a bit careful where you choose to eat and listen to Fado etc, but if you want to travel back a couple of hundred years into the real Lisbon, you have to start here."

There's no single sight.. it's just a great place to walk around and feel the atmosphere of a real neighbourhood... with a history of hard times.This was one of the few areas less affected by the massive earthquake in 1755 thanks to its solid rock foundations... so lots of houses that have stood longer than any others in Lisbon. This is one areas known for fado restaurants (bit touristy but still worth it).If you're staying in the area, there aren't many food shops... nearest supermarket is down at Santa Apollonia station. Wear good walking shoes and be ready for some steep steps and cobbled streets!"

Lots of restaurants. Be careful, though -- it seems a common practice in Lisbon is that they will bring things to your table, like bread, a plate of cheese, and when they brought our \"main course\" tapas, they also brought a plate with 3 small potatoe/cod patties. At the end of our dinner we asked for the bill and almost flipped. They charged us for every single thing that they brought -- none of which we asked for and assumed it came with the meal. In Toronto, it's common for most restaurants to bring a basket of bread --- here we were charged 2 Euros, etc. Anyhow, back to Alfama. Lots of photo opportunities. If you're not in shape or have mobility problems, just take Tram 28, it takes you through and you get the idea."

We don't think Alfama is a must see according to our experience. If you are in Lisbon for a short stay there are other area that we preferred over Alfama such as Biaxa, Bairo Alto and the city centre. However, do keep in mind we were in Alfama after 6pm, perhaps earlier in the day it could be a more pleasurable experience."

Don't try to get even close with a car, and don't expect the tram ride through the place to give you more than a small glimpse. Take 2 days to experience it all if you want to eat well and enjoy some fado, too. If your legs can't take all that walking up and down the stairs, take a day or two in between the visits to recover. ..then again, if you can't handle all that walking you may not want to go to Lisbon in the first place. It has it's ups and downs, very real ones for that matter - they're called hills, and they're everywhere. Think San Francisco. Just don't expect it to be the same as SF even though you have similar bridges and lots of hills. Those two are nothing alike. I love both, but one doesn't replace the other. =)"

At the very top, you enter the castle. We felt we had been somewhere different and as it was February, there were few other touruists about."

There are wandering peacocks, beggars who bless you when you give them anything and people selling home made souvenirs. The walk down was equally charming , and should be down as slowly and serendipitously as possible. When we got to the bottom we turned right and after a while reached an area which felt a bit more edgy.

Quite easy to get lost in these streets, but probably half the fun of it, apparently the layout of the streets hasn't changed since they were designed hundreds of years ago, it's an area primarily linked to the sea, and is where alot of fishmongers sell the daily catch. Best to start at the top of the district and walk down, as it's quite a hilly area."

When you see Lisbon captured in postcards or drawings and there are images of narrow cobbled streets with red-roofed buildings and laundry hanging from clotheslines, you are probably looking at the Alfama. This is not an affluent part of town, and although it relies on tourists, it does not have many tourist amenities: WCs, maps, well-identified streets. You will definitely get lost in the Alfama, but that is part of the charm. The whole area is quite small, but because of the labyrinth, you will spend at least 2 hours here just finding your way. Locals speak only Portuguese, and they have likely near heard of that tiny largo/square you're looking for.Take the trolley #12E from Pra\u00e7a da Figueira to the Castle, and make your way down the hill, towards the water. The Miradouro Sao Jorge is a great spot for photos, the cathedral is worth a stop, and I loved the Fado Museum. (It helped me decide if I would stop at a fado club that evening.) But the highlight is just walking around, checking every nook and cranny. It's tiring, though - the hill is steep here. But it's worth it for the atmosphere, and the many photos you can take of everyday life.I wouldn't want to travel here solo at night, but in the daytime, it's wonderful. It's a nice way to spend a morning, but have lunch somewhere else. And go to a fado club in the safer Bairro Alto area."

St. Jorge castle, or the Graca church, with local singers setting up for Flamenco guitas and beautiful singing echoing off the front of this grand church? Pastry?

My advice now as a resident of Alfama is to just wander around the streets, don't get obsessed with a map and finding particular things as you will stumble across many interesting little shops, restaurants, lookouts - \"miradouros\" and cafes. Alfama comes alive at night, it is quiet after lunch when some places are shut. There are many restaurants with prices ranging from as little as 4.50 euros to as much as nearly 20 euros for a main meal. Do not be put off by the look of Alfama, it is a safe area and most people that live in the area are old or young families. I would definitely spend a late afternoon wandering the streets, stopping at a cafe at one of the miradouros and then heading to a restaurant late around 9pm to get the full feeling of nightlife in Alfama. Summer is more alive than winter when more little bars and restaurants open and you can sit outside."

Just wander haphazardly in a street, then another and watch, listen and smell. You'll probably end up on one of the miradouros (points of view over Lisbon) that are worth the aching legs.If you climb high enough, you'll get to the Castelo S\u00e3o Jorge (the Castle Saint George) and you'll know you've reached the climax of this beautiful neighbourhood."
