The tour guides will tell about the recent history of Cambodia with a sobering personal touch.The museum has a collection of weapons found in Cambodia after the Civil War. Some of the pieces (and some of the bigger ones) were still active only 17 years ago.Includes a shack of light weapons that can be held, but for the love of God don't point them at anyone anyway. "

Allow about an hour, more if you want to really read and absorb the displays and artifacts. A free guide is provided, if wanted. We were lucky enough to be taken around by \"the cat\" - so named as he's had a fair share of hospitalisation visits during his involvement in the conflict, starting as a young boy soldier aged 14. He'll happily show you his shrapnel wounds from land mines, some of which are still lodged in his body. Feel it! He invites. Wander at your leisure around the graveyard of vehicles, armaments, tanks, field artillery, and even an old jet and Russian helicopter, and various personnel carriers, some of which the guide tells us, his friends died in, captain this, colonel that, general too. Look, he explains, you can see his shoes and his femur, and other bones still in the skeleton body of the tank. Not to sure about that. Looked a bit staged, or at least unnecessary. Take time to read a little around the history of the conflict from the French departure circa 1960, through the turbulent period of conflict fuelled by the world's opposing warring nations, to the very recent late 90's. The deaths from land mines still making their toll on the war torn country. 1000 years ago they built \"the Wat\" kingdoms here, and slaughtered each other to destruction. Not much change there then."

We have to say that we were glad we did have the opportunity to visit this museum. It is set in an open field, and there isn't much cover from the elements, but that's what makes this museum unique. Our guide spoke English quite well and was very knowledgeable and willing to pass on his knowledge about Cambodias history to us. There are quite a few exhibits in the museum and you are given the opportunity to look around as you please after you've been taken around by the guide. If you're in the Siem Reap area, add this to your list of thing's to do."

At 26, he's got an insight into the history, present and future of Cambodia that is well worth the price of admission alone. We were lucky to get extra information after the official tour from this wonderful young fellow. The museum itself has a few must sees. For one, the helicopter defies physics - or at least it would seem it did all those years ago. It's only four kms from the heart of Siem Reap, costing about $6US for the ride there and back in a tuk tuk. I'd say if you want further insight into this complex country and it's people, definitely visit this museum."

Besides that, the reading material is poor. I learnt much more about the Cambodia war reading Wikipedia rather than reading the information available in this place. I was told that there would be guides there but none was available when I arrived. After a while, I saw a guide with an Australian couple and asked politely if I could join them. They all agreed I could join them. However, the guide (who apparently was a war veteran) would not say anything about the war. Instead, he kept showing the scars he got during the war period. Apart from showing his scars, he also kept saying every two minutes that Australia was the greatest country in the world. Actually, I didn\u2019t understand why he was so obsessed in repeating this. So, I just gave up, walked away and took a tuk-tuk back to the city centre. This so called museum is a completely waste of time. I don\u2019t recommend it."

I did not know much about Cambodian history related to the Khmer Rouge just that there were child soldiers and a lot of land mines. The cat lived through this horrible time in Cambodian history and will show you the physical memories he has scarred onto his body including his prosthetic leg from encountering a land mine and the shrapnel he still feels under his skin. You will also be taken to a tank where one of his friends died and his bones are still able to be seen. This museum is amazing and you would be upset to miss it.

There is a vast array of vehicles, artillery, weaponry and equipment on display, such as T-54 tanks, a Shenyang F-6 fighter, aMil Mi-8 helicopter and the D-44 85mm divisional field artillery gun. The collection on display was gathered since 1999 from provinces in which the most savage fighting took place (Siem Reap and Odor Meanchey) and is a mix of Chinese, American and Soviet hardware. Competition from scrap dealers was not the only problem the museum faced as it gathered its collection: most of the machinery was very heavy and it was difficult to gain access to dense jungle areas to remove the items. Before being used during the various conflicts that raged across Cambodia, some of the war machines have seen action during World War II. Among the collection there are also many sorts of landmines and photographs from the defined period of time in Cambodia."

The tour guide provided by the museum had excellent English (by Cambodian standard), though he is not a veteran, he was very familiar with both the history and the weapons.  Firstly, the articles and history provided about the war with the Khmer Rouge were pretty brief but were clear enough to understand. I think the museum can improve in this aspect as there can be more information provided, which would further the visitor's understanding of the war. Secondly, there were a large variety of weapons and vehicles and the number was actually quite astonishing. I'll write a brief list of weapons I saw (I'm not too familiar of model names so it might not be too clear):-AK47-M16-PPS, PPSH5-M1 Garand-A variety of light machine guns-A variety of rocket launchers and grenade launchers-Landmines-Bomb and artillery shells-A jet and helicopter-A variety of tanks and artillerySuprisingly, all these were also accessible, for example, you are allowed to pick up rifles and climb on tanks, compared to other war museums where everything is locked up or fenced in. The tanks were lined up neatly, which created a creepy atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this museum to others as it is suitable for all ages and the content is fascinating. I would say this is a must go in Siem Reap and it would not take up too much time."

Sinath, the Cat with nine lives, shared his personal experiences of war with us, giving us a far deeper understanding of the horrors of war than a pre-recorded audioguide or book could have. Seeing and hearing about the horrors that happened less than a generation ago was terrible, but necessary so that no such atrocity can ever happen again."

His true name escapes me but I think Siroth is close.He guided us around the exhibit and gave his account as a solder fighting against the Khmer Rouge after they wiped out his family. Who can know the horrors of war better than those who lived it, suvived it. Not unscathed though as he has the wounds of 3 bullets and those of shrapnel along with some bad burn scars from a mate who wasn't careful enough to check around him as he launched a rocket powered grenande in the heat of battle. Fascinating. Well worth doing for the story from a real life veteran of the conflict. Shocking stories of 'Child Soldiers' brainwashed by Propoganda and conscripted into the Genocidal reign of Pol Pot - not his real name though you'll find. And find out who funded and backed this scrap, who committed arms and machinery and enough mines that today there is 2.5 mines for every man woman & child in Cambodia. There is around 2-3 deaths / casualties per month through land mines that remain in the landscape...."

The museum is very hands on and features genuine hardware from years of conflict, it isn't about shiny exhibits but rather raw, sobering reminders of war.

I watched the movie \"The Killing Fields\" When it was released and will never forget those haunting scenes and the feelings of shock and disbelief that people can intentionally carry out such atrocities! Ever since I wanted to learn more about the civil war in Cambodia and this visit to the War Museum was an incredible experience. We took a tuk-tuk from our hotel. I can really recommend this to all visitors. The driver was a lovely young man who communicated well in English. In the tuk-tuk you really get to see a bit of the countryside on the way to the museum and we took lovely pictures of the paddy fields and rural scenes.Arriving at the War Museum, entry only $5 per person, we met a guide at the gate who showed us around and shared his experiences as a child during the civil war. I believe that this personal account of what had happened in Cambodia contributed to making the experience. One hesitates to say \"fantastic\", since it is a museum that gives testimony to the horrors of the war. I do believe, however, that a visit to the museum was a highlight to our visit to Siem Reap and a must to all tourists. It is more than mere sightseeing. It is an experience that makes you reflect on humankind! Do take the time to visit and do ask one of the guides to take you on a tour. It wouldn't be the same without listening to their personal recounts of the war.A bonus to the visit is the incredible photo opportunities."

All the tourguides (offering free tours) are war veterans or were children during the khmer rouge time, they incorporate their personal experiences and stories in their tour which makes it honest and really makes you understand how much they have been through. Go here to understand the impact the history of Cambodia has on their current society. Don't go here to get entertained, the museum (like it should) focusses on making you understand how something like this could have ever happend and how a war has the power to destroy an entire country and it's population. For me, all the negative reactions do not make any sense, obviously, the museum is not making a lot of profit and has to provide a living for these war veterans. A museum that is trying to teach you all the negative impacts of a war is not going spend the little money they make on expensive restauration of rusty tanks. The point is that something like this is never supossed to happen again, not to entertain. Please visit this museum and join a tour, you won't regret it."

Handprinted signs, fading photographs and rusting machinery of war in a tended garden grove. The typewritten summaries of the 20th century wars dispassionately painted the contributions of the main players to the series of catastrophes that characterised the 1960s - 1980s in Cambodia. (although to say \"players\" minimises the guilt of individuals, groups and whole national administrations.)$5 entry for non-nationals. Tour guides are free (and passionate) and a novelist was on hand to talk about his book detailing individual experiences of the war.I left feeling that the Killing Fields were the worst, but only one of a series of crimes inflicted on this gentle people. The ramshackle nature of the museum is a reminder of the challenges that Cambodia still faces."

This museum was definitely insightful, and it was fascinating if at times a bit jarring to hear the war being spoken about by a former KR boy-soldier who later defected and joined the Vietnamese. The exhibitions had a great number of artifacts, and well-written explanations in English. The tanks in particular effected me as the signs all indicated when they had been destroyed or found and some were within the 21st century - which just reinforces just how recent Cambodia's tragic past was. It is a quick one though, we were there for about an hour and a half and that was at a very slow pace. It's on the way to the airport though, and worth the stop if you are going to be going by. I would say, if you feel like you only have time for one war related museum, my personal preference was the Landmines museum - the War Museum did have a larger variety of war artifacts (more than landmines) but the Landmine Museum was more unique and moving experience for me."

A tuk tuk from our hotel was US$10 and he waited for usThe day we went was hot and still which added to the experience. When we arrived we were greeted at the gate by a young man who told us a guide would be with us in a few minutes. Our guide when he arrived was a young man whose Grandfather had been detained and later executed simply for being an academic. His Father died fighting against the Khmer Rouge and his Mother died of a broken heart. He was raised by his Grandmother. I really wish I could remember his name.We were taken around the museum grounds by this young man who talked non stop about what we were seeing and told us so much about the conflict and the dreadful things that happened to the Cambodian population. The photographic displays combined with the history and the stories were very confronting and incredibly sad. It was also inspiring to see how the people who has survived this horror were working to rebuild their country and did not take anything for granted.There are many guns and landmines and other implements of death that can be handled and examined if you wish to.Once our guided tour was finished we wandered around looking at the various different tanks and guns as well as the MIG jet and Sikorsky helicopter. The tanks, guns etc are displayed exactly as they were found. Bullet holes, mangled metal and gaping holes all very much in evidence which really made everything so real.We also got to meet and talk at length to Karl Levy, an Australian author who has penned the biography of Sinarth who fought in the Cambodian Army against the Khmer Rouge. Sinarth is also a guide at the museum but unfortunately was not rostered on the day we were there.A visit to this museum has to be included on the Must Do list for Siem Reap. All of the guides are either Cambodian soliders or the children of deceased soldiers so they have a very personal connection with everything they are telling you about."

Guides are free of charge but a tip is appreciated, as is a donation to land mine victims who are no longer supported by the Cambodian Government. I had the opportunity to meet Sinarth a guide who was a child soldier under the Khmere Rouge in the 1970's and Karl Levy, an author who has written a biography of Sinarth and was selling it at the museum. Karl also has alternative views on the rise of the Khmere Rouge and their ultimate defeat. In all an interesting time."

It is a little way (maybe 10 minutes from Pub Street). We hired a tuk tuk who waited there for us. 6 dollars return (May 2016). The cost for entry is 5 dollars and the tour guide is free. Our tour guide was superb. Very informative and really brought to life the whole thing. I would suggest that without a guide you wouldn't get much from the visit, as the about of written displays is minimal. The tour guide spoke from personal experience, which really bought it home. Sadly, not a history I knew much about, but the guide explained everything very well and I am left humbler, and far more knowledgeable. I would suggest that this should be on everyone's list for Siem Reap. You can handle/climb on any of the exhibits, which I didn't much like the thought of, but everyone who was there when we were, were very respectable - maybe holding a gun to feel the weight, but not posing with an AK47 that quite likely was used to kill. The fact that they are so happy for you to handle/play with all of the exhibits just brings home how normal, horrible and prevalent guns etc are in everyone's memory. I am surprised by a previous reviewer saying about pressure to donate. We had none - not even a mention. There was just a collection box at the gate which I left some money in through personal choice. A must see!"

If you're not interested in learning about Cambodia's war history or seeing old metal war relics, then this is not the place for you. Before you go, its important to understand that this attraction is cheaper because there is not much there to see. The enjoyment you get from the visit is in the tour guides. They each have a personal connection to the war and tell all sorts of stories during the visit. At the end they give you a sad story about something and ask for money. You're free to not donate but there is a bit of awkwardness if you don't. Just keep in perspective that even 1000 riel ($0.25 usd) is a decent donation in this country.I enjoyed the visit but I wasn't expecting the same calibre as other more expensive attractions in Siem Reap."

This is a small, community-run museum, with an emphasis on employing disabled land mine survivors and veterans of the civil war and Khmer Rouge period, which sets it apart from other war museums in Cambodia. It is quite newly-opened and while the exhibits may seem sparse at first glance, there is actually a wealth of information to learn. Our guide, son of a veteran, was very knowledgable and shared with us known facts about the war but also his own opinions about the causes and effects. He spoke unusually candidly, and we felt we could ask him whatever questions we liked. A very interesting experience, and one that can easily be combined with a trip to the temples, to give you an overview of Cambodia's more recent history."

This was an interesting place to visit. Learning more about the Khmer Rouge, what happened, who did it and how it affected the country as a whole. It was interesting to think that the entire grounds were covered in Landmines and today is an outdoor Museum. We had a guide who was amazing - I am sorry I forget his name! Meng - Something I believe. Anyways, he was great and I got some great understanding of what happened. I know a bit more about Cambodian History and how resilient their people are and how much the country has flourished since everything happened only 40 years ago. I cannot wait to go back and see how much more they have accomplished and grown. My only suggestion is just that, to end the tour with something positive, to show some pictures of a war torn area during the war and then after. To show tourists how amazing Cambodian people are and how they have moved on and started all over again."

They have guns and weapons that you can hold to get a feel for what it must have been like for those impacted in war time.But the real part that made our visit was our free tour guide - \"the cat\" because he has died 13 times. His story was unbearably heart wrenching and at point had me nearly in tears. His entire family killed when he was a child and he joined up to the army because they would feed him and it was the only way to get food. He told us stories of seeing his friends die in front of him, bullet wounds, showed us the shrapnel still stuck in his body. He lost a leg from a land mine and also his wife to lung cancer from the uranium used in the weapons. Truly a remarkable man who has been through so much horror in his life, he was so kind to us despite the hurt and anger that he so clearly and rightfully still feels."

To just walk around a bunch of rusty military relics would have been a challenge without a guide. The guide helped us to better understand the recent (50 years) history, which turned into a fascinating hour or so tour. There is an entrance fee but the guide was free, although tips are always welcomed."

I wasn't sure why but discovered later that the museum isn't on the list of things to do in Siem Reap of most of the visitors. Collection of military equipment ranging from pistols and guns to tanks and even a MilMi8 helicopter and a Mig19 is interesting (even if it is rusting away out in the open) but it is not as interesting as the stories you will here from your free (tip them at the end, they deserve it) guide. The guides are all connected to the war in some way. They are war veterans, war survivors, land mine victims... Our guide was a war veteran who was drafted in the army at the age of seventeen and got his arm amputated following a shrapnel from a grenade. His story was really touching and eye opening.There is a 5$ admission fee and you will need a Tuk-Tuk to get there. We had a Tuk-Tuk driver for the day of Angkor exploration so I can't say anything about what should be a reasonable price to get to the museum from the city."

Free guides although a tip is expected at the end of the tour. Kyle Levy, an Australian, is currently working there and has written a book about the Cambodian boy soldiers, and specifically about Sianath (spelling probably incorrect), who is now 59 and also working there. He has so much shrapnel in his body from bullets and lost the lower part of one leg to a land mine yet he has an amazing spirit and willing to share some of his story. We were amazed that people could pick up the guns. Kyle is currently cataloging all the weapons so they are accurately identified by country of origin etc. The museum is relatively small with several huts displaying photos, equipment and clothing. There are many tanks and other pieces of large equipment set out in the grounds along with a couple of aircraft. Suggest that this is somewhere to spend an hour or two especially if you are looking to go somewhere away from crowds. Sobering and confronting but worth the visit."

You will learn about that history here. What makes it special are the guides, each of whom has a personal story related to that civil war. The actual items in the museum, all of which are outside, are not that impressive by themselves, but when placed in the context of the guides' personal stories become quite powerful.

The first day I just popped in quickly to have a look and was taken by the hardware on display, a lot of tanks and troop carriers, all rusty and with no wheels. I looked around, handled a few of the many guns and didn't think much of it. On the second day I went, because a son was on another excursion the day before I was lucky enough to get there in time to hear author Karl Levy give a very good summary of the root causes of the war and its key actors. Brilliant. Once he was finished we were handed over to a Cambodian veteran. It was only after he showed us one of his trip advisor reviews that I worked out he had introduced himself as Cat, or the Cat. To my Australian ears, and with his accent, I heard something altogether more vernacular! Well, what a story he has to tell, and he told it well, involving everyone in a 4D tour of the museum and his many injuries, he is called the Cat because of his 9+ lives. And why do all the vehicles have no wheels? Because they had all struck one of the millions of mines still in Cambodia. Once he said that it was obvious that the armour on these massive Russian vehicles had been torn apart like tissue paper, some as recently as in the late 90s. Again, not a big, fancy museum, but it will give you some insight into the terror and horror that everyone must have lived through."

It's all outdoors so probably go in the morning before it gets too hot. Expect it to take a couple of hours."

Make sure you get one of the free guides to show you around, they have all been personally effected by the war and the Khmer Rouge regime and therefore have their own stories to tell. Our guide was the young Meng who's family were refugees from the war and his father was killed fighting against the Khmer Rouge. The guides are free but make a living from donations - I would say they are worth every dollar you give them especially as the entrance fee was only $5.It's important to also remember this is not a museum in the traditional sense. It is out doors (there's lots of shade but bring water) and it is a ex landmine field that has now been cleared. The armoury and guns etc were used in a war so no they are not bright, shiny and new. You go to the War Museum to learn so listen to the guide read the information and take your time going around.It was one of the most thought provoking museums I have ever visited."

The war museum is a large area of land (formerly full of land mines) with many ex military vehicles on display, with various buildings holding weaponry and ammunition. There are many trees so despite visiting in 38 degree heat walking around the ground in shade was very pleasant, and the hardware on display fascinating, if a little frightening.There's a free optional guide included in the $5 admission price which was well worth taking up as we were taken around the grounds and given a history of the conflicts in Cambodia, with some personal anecdotes thrown in. Our guide was polite, friendly and very informative, and afterwards we were free to explore the museum on our own for as long as we liked.There are some harrowing tales and imagery in the huts that display the weapons, but nothing too graphic. These are easily avoidable if not your kind of thing, and honestly this is as gentle a primer for the horrors of the Khmer rouge that you could expect. I think that if you're coming to Siem Reap you need to come here, to see the terrible recent past this country is emerging from, and better appreciate the country as it is now. The past isn't sugar coated but nor is it morbidly dug up, this was a very respectful and peaceful afternoon."

Highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn a bit about the very recent history that unfolded in the area. It seems crucial to preserve these artifacts and this history and it is unfortunate that the museum struggles to find the resources it needs. Having a free guide with the $5 entrance fee was great, and entirely worth it. We had Meng, and while he didn't have the same experiences some of the guides mentioned in other reviews had, he was still awesome. He told great stories, and was able to answer everyone questions in great detail. This was a fairly quick, educational way to spend an afternoon, and a welcomed break from walking around the temples."

It was a moving experience - the tanks and guns are the physical remains of a terrible time for this beautiful country. It was recent enough that those who participated are there as gudes - the objects bring it home to the visitor how such crude pieces of weaponry can reek havoc. Reminiscent of visiting the remains left behind in France, fifteen years after the end of the second world war. Noone would question that the Impertial War Museum and the Normandy landings museum are important and it is good to support those who are there to record firsthand what happened in Cambodia."

Our guide 'the cat' all will be revealed if you visit, was quite a character and added an extra element to what was a very sobering tour. Heartbreaking to hear that at least 2 people per month are still killed/injured as mines are discovered in simple farmland etc It is a small museum, set outdoors, so rather nicer than the air conditioned building I had imagined as a war museum. Guns, tanks, missiles and of course landmines are displayed, though much more than this, many photo boards showing the atrocities of the Democratic Kampuchea 1975-1979. There is a small shop, mainly selling books. As part of Cambodias history I suggest this should be visited in addition to the temples of the area."

The tour takes 40 minute and you are then given time to look round. There is a small bookshop and drinks can be purchased but it is wise to ensure you take your own water as well to ensure that you remain hydrated during the tour.The guide took us around each area in turn and explained the history very well.

There's also a very confronting replica of landmines inside the compound. For a short time, I thought they were genuine and active. My saddest memory of being here was being followed into the compound by a busload of Vietnamese tourists. One ran up to the weapons rack, took down an AK47 and mimicked shooting people - a throwback to the North/South conflict of the 60's /70's ? Whether a throwback to his \"glory days\" when he was in the army (North or South) or just someone pretending to be a soldier, I found that moment to be unsettling.Inside, there are also photos of soldiers of the Cambodian army, some of whom you may see on the streets in Siem Reap; without arms, victims of landmines in the district."

Our guide was called \"The Cat\" ( 9 lives and then some) told us all about the land mines and tanks and showed us all his scars from AK47's, shrapnel and bee's (Bee's??? you will have to ask him) culminating with the missing right leg. Such an interesting man with a story to tell that has been written in a book which to my shame I did not buy as I was too overwhelmed to think by the end of our visit.Nothing is sugar coated it was a war and he tells it as it was"

A small museum, with many great pictures, ammunition, tanks, mines. The free guides are great for information and able to ask any question. We joined a second free guide for a different perspective and was better than the first. Sinarth was a child solder in the war now working at the museum. Karl Levy wrote a book on Sinarth's story and was there to discuss the book and sign it. Karl and Sinarth made the experience above and beyond. Definitely would recommend going. Enlightening into the true experiences of the war."

I'm disappointed to see that some of these reviews read like the appraisal of a hotel or standard tourist attraction so here are my thoughts, having visited this week- for whatever they're worth.It seems to have been neglected by many that you're walking round an actual former minefield (where people undoubtedly died) with a war veteran who has been through more than you could possibly imagine. You are shown tanks (rusty, as one reviewer puts it) in which people died and within which their bones still remain. The exhibits aren't there for entertainment; they attempt to contextualise a relatively recent period of Cambodian history very hard for most visitors in 2016 to comprehend.This place should be treated with the intrigue of a museum and also the respect of a war cemetery. It was a privilege to have been able to visit."

It had a simple rustic feel to the place which I really liked. Coming from a place where everything would be in glass cabinets and behind ropes it was really nice to be able to get up close to some war remnants. We had an awesome tour guide (the provide free tours). His name was Tom and he spoke really good English and had a really great sense of humour. He knew a lot about the history of Cambodia and made the tour very engaging. He was able to explain all parts of the museum and gave the experience a very personal touch. Although other review may complain that it's not very big or not much to see I think it should be kept in mind this is run by a group of individuals wishing to share their knowledge it's does not have millions of dollars pumped into it by the government like some war museums in the world. We found an 1-2 hours was a good length of time to spend there. I am very glad we took the time to go here, it is very worthwhile choosing to have a tour guide. He just made the whole experience so much more informative. Thank you very much Tom and all the staff at the Siem Reap War Museum."

Travellers to Siem Reap and Angkor Wat can learn something more recent than ancient history at this outdoor museum. Privately owned and set in a \"rustic\" setting on the outskirts of Siem Reap, the War Museum offers visitors a no-charge (but donations are definitely appreciated) personal tour of war and genocide relics, conducted by a Cambodian with personal experience of the US bombing of Cambodia and the subsequent nightmarish 1975-79 Khmer Rouge regime. The tour is intimate, quiet, intelligent and deeply moving. The old guns, plane, helicopter, mortars, landmines and hundreds of photos and weapons give a chilling taste of what constant war was like for this fragile, agrarian country. I strongly recommend a visit - but TIP THE TOURGUIDE, rather than putting everything in the donation box. Also, like everywhere else, wear a hat and take water."

Just stop and think, where have they come from.......what happened to the crew when it was hit........did they get out.......or did they not. Now look at the vehicle again. Then there is the wall of weapons, you can handle any of the guns, shells, mortars etc and again think to yourself, what happened to the guns owner, what did the owner do with this gun, there is a very high proability with the area you are in that these guns have blood on them. I have not really been one for history of wars etc but after visiting here it's made me think. Personally I would like to see more museums like this where you can touch, feel and hold such items. "

It is a pity that most Asian tourists opt for shopping, good food and bypass museums. If you are interested in knowing more about the history and prefer a small, quiet \"tourist attraction\", consider this!"

It is incredibly informative and gives a confronting up close insight into decades of conflict in Cambodia. Yet most tourist bypass it on the way to the temples. The guides have all experienced the civil war as veterans, landmine survivors or as civilians and they are what make this museum. They are not looking for pity they just want the stories to continue to be told to educated and hopefully ensure that these atrocities are never allowed to happen again. Our guide told us not only of his own personal story of being the son of an unwilling soldier, the daily fear of stepping on landmines but also of the unimaginable suffering the Cambodian people have endured, and even still do 16 years on. I have read the books, seen the movies but to hear the personal stories from those who survived the war is absolutely heartbreaking. This was one very emotional day which will be ingrained in my memory forever!I took my 9 and 10 year olds, whilst they couldn't comprehend a lot of the stories they certainly understood what it was all about and it was very educational for them.Please don't forgot to leave a generous donation!!!"

What makes the visit truly amazing is the personal story of the tour guide. We were fortunate to have Tom as our guide. He was injured by a landmine at the age of 16 and tells a deeply personal story of how war affected Camboda (and how it continues to affects the country via landlines and the tool on its peoples).The guides are all volunteers, so be prepared for to give a tip that also goes towards war victims.Or visit to the War Museum was a moving experience for my whole family. A definite chance to connect with with its history. It is located towards the airport. A tuk tuk will take you there, wait and take you back to town for $10 but you can further bargain down that price."

Not sure what to expect but was actually one of my highlights of my whole trip to Cambodia! It is only small, mainly outdoors and the guided tour only lasts one hour, but you can wonder around by yourself afterwards. Everything is in English. For a small entrance fee you are greated by a war veteran who gives you an extremely good, yet unbiased insight into all aspects of the war - not just the bits you may have heard about in films or on the news. I learnt so much and came away feeling very appreciative and more knowledgeable. There are many photos taken during and after the war, as well as disused tanks/war supplies, old mines etc.Our guide, Sokham was inspirational. He lost his arm to a landmine whilst fighting the Kyhmer Rouge when he was only 14. He also talked about the current sociopolitical context of the country which is very interesting. He was willing to answer any questions and was grateful at our interest.What surprised was it's lack of visitors. They were so grateful for our visit and it annoyed me that more tourists don't visit. It isn't publicised very well which is a shame and, in my opinion, you cannot visit a country like this without making time to understand its history and plight of its people to get to where they are today. This museum does just that.Please remember, all guides are volunteers and rely on tips. I think they do a fantastic job and hopefully more people will take the time to come and visit. Warning: It is very emotional! I cannot rate this museum enough."

I strongly recommend this, as you can get a greater understanding of the conflict. Tips are not expected, but appreciated and in my opinion, deserved. We had a guide for around 30 mins, who was also able to answer any questions we had. Be considerate when touching or taking pictures with the vehicles/weapons, the guide will probably remind you that many died as a result of them.

Long story short, he was very knowledgeable, and like the majority of Cambodians, impacted by the horrors of the Khmer Rouge tyranny. The museum showed the machines of war, utilized from 1975, all the way up the 1999. It was shocking to see a tank in the museum, that was still in use in 1999. Seeing the actual war machines (decommissioned of course) really hit everything home. Very educational and must see, if you want to learn more about the war in Cambodia."

The museum is a little off the beaten path and I was taken by a tuk tuk- we stopped at a tourism office in town to purchase my $5 USD ticket beforehand, for some reason. When I arrived, I was surprised to find practically no one there. I entered the outdoor museum (alone, mind you) and was greeted by a guide. The guides are free and very informative (albeit slightly difficult to understand.) Mine escorted me around the property, which is filled with planes, helicopters, tanks, guns, land mines, grenades, and every other weapon you can possibly think of. His stories absolutely broke my heart \u2013 pointing out particular kinds of land mines that killed his friends, talking about his parents\u2019 passing, and going into detail about the fear of bombs, being dropped by my own country. He spoke about several of the other tour guides, and it seems everyone that works there has been directly affected by the Khmer Rouge. There\u2019s nothing particularly wonderful about this museum in terms of aesthetics, but if you want to educate yourself and get personalized treatment, the museum could really use your support.

Angkor wat might be cool, but without a visit to the war museum and the guides (I emphasise the guides, since they are the most important part of the museum) you will never understand Cambodia as a whole. And if information, a more humble view on life, and learning things about the country you visit, isn't interesting to you, well no problem! The also have aa Chinese Mig fighter jet as well as a sovjet helicopter, and tons of guns you can hold and pose with. A great place to visit no matter what your intentions are"

To get a detailed version of what this country has gone through, go and visit this site. The guides are free with entry fee and all are former war veterans, Some fought for Khmer Rouge and some against them. All were wounded in more ways than one. Their storys are compelling and they are working hard to make Cambodia a better country, If you can get Tom to be your guide. He is a genuine man and a great storyteller. He really made this experience worth our time."

Background on pricing etc - there is an entrance fee of $5 and you will need a tuk tuk to get out to the museum as it's about 20 minutes from the Pub St area, for us i think this was $7 return.Now the Mueseum, firstly get a guide (included in price) - they are worth their weight in gold for the information and background they give you.Our guide was a Khmer child soldier at 10. Although the Khmer history is mind-boggling to comprehend, he made it real. From the guns with bent barrels from the heat to the stories of how people were killed using sharpened bamboo to save on bullets. The museum houses a lot of tanks and big machinery as well as guns, landmines and photos from the war, but without the stories it's just a collection.If you're not coming to Siem Reap for the cheap grog, and want to know more about the culture than the temples, this is the stop to really be able understand the country and it's people and everything they've been through."

He lived through this period of time and his stories were fascinating.It is an open air museum with a few huts that hold the landmines and guns that were used, as well as photos. They collected tanks etc. and brought them into Siem Reap and explained a lot of history. For instance people were taken and chained inside the tanks and left to die. The early landmines were easy to find as metal detectors were used but as the war went on the mines were made out of plastic and impossible to find.We were told that the amputees you see in town are proud people and they sell books or play in bands to make money. It was definitely worth the visit."

The guides are free and I highly recommend that you get one.

Our guide spoke perfect English and he often gets asked why he doesn;t move to another country. He chooses to stay in Cambodia and volunteer at the War Museum as he believes in the importance of sharing his story and the troubled history that his country has been through. We gave him a very good tip as we were extremely grateful for his honest and emotional story and for all of the information that he shared with us. He answered all of our questions openly and honestly. This is definitely worth a visit!$5 for adults and kids are free. Get a free guide and tip them well if you were happy with them.

I was impressed by the number of tank, artillery and gun displayed in the museum. There was also a fighter jet and a combat helicopter to greet you at the entrance.You can roam freely without guide but I would strongly advise to ask for a guide (its free anyway) or wait for one because as survivors of the war, they would give insight explanation of what had happened during the war. The lack of information displayed at each items is also one of the reason why you need a guide.The location of the museum is quite far from the main road but it is just about 10 minutes tuk tuk ride from the town. In my opinion, this is the best platform to learn about the war during the Khmer Rouge era."

With the exception of the aircraft most of the artifacts were recovered in the field and showed battle damage, some quite severe. Also quite a collection of a variety of mines and ordinance. One of the things that made the experience more than just a collection of hardware was the opportunity to go to the museum with one of the actual veterans of that combat during the Khmer Rouge era. Our guide lost his family during the early years of the Khmer Rouge, all killed but himself when he was nine years old. Eventually he fought against The Khmer Rouge and was seriously wounded a number of times. He showed us battle wounds including several AK 47 rounds, a piece of shrapnel under his skin, scars from mine damage and lifted his pants leg to reveal a prosthetic limb from a mine injury. All of this beginning as a 13 year old soldier. His accounts of the mass killings under the Pol Pot regime were almost surreal. No question that this visit was worthwhile, if not more than a bit uncomfortable, in understanding how ideological struggles translate to human misery. $5 admission pp and an optional guide tip supports these individuals. Easily accessible by tuk tuk."

As an adult, I knew very little about the Khmer Rouge regime or anything really about the **** **** Pol Pot!! It's really hard not to swear in this review, such is the anger for that evil dictator and what he did to this Country. The museum is a very harsh and stark reminder of just what the people of Cambodia suffered in just a very short space of time in those dark years of the early 70's. It's extremely well presented and quite poignant in it's location. How you can walk around lush foliage, trees and manicured gardens, but scattered amongst them are tanks, cannons, shells, ammunition and so many horrific images is a real eye opener. It's reflective, emotional, educational and should make anyone who visits feel extremely lucky, privileged and honoured to even be sharing a part of this dark period in Cambodia's history. I know Siem Reap is all about Angkor, but you must find time to visit this museum...........please."

The atrocities caused by the Khmer Rouge on their own people is daunting enough but to see it would of been more devastating. Take the time to visit. Like everything they have their story to tell. A sad but true reflection on how mankind can be so cruel. The artifacts no longer work but would be great to see a restoration program start trying to bring some former glory to these beasts of war. This attraction is really for all age groups, and I listened to a old US soldier talking about his time in SEA during his service puts this museum where it should be something that needs to be told to all future visitors and generations of asset that should not be forgotten."

Only $5 entry it includes a free guide who has been injured as a result of war. Our guide spoke great English and provided great explanations of the myriad exhibits. Awesome photos and all the weaponry you could wish to see. The museum is a sad and poignant reminder of what Cambodia has suffered and is still suffering with 2 million land mines in the ground killing and injuring people every day, even in 2015. Apart from the fact this museum is an awesome record of troubled times, with only 20 visitors a day at the moment it will die if not supported - and that will also be a tragedy"

A mixture of sadness, anger and disbelief at man's inhumanity to man. Yes it is worth seeing if only to bring into sharp focus what happened here and at other sites across Cambodia. Is it interesting? Yes but in the most odd way. My visit created a desire in me to read more about the history of this wonderful nation and to try to understand the mind of Pol Pot and his followers. Have I succeeded? Well in same ways. Do come here but be prepared to be saddened by the experience"

I understand why previous reviewers may have given the museum a low review, as the museum doesn't have a professional touch to it (as say the National Museum does). While it lacks fancy exhibits, it does have many artifacts from the war, including mines, small arms, tanks, and even a helicopter. What truly makes the museum is the guide. A guide comes with your 5$ admission fee. My guide recently graduated university, and his father had fought in the war. Other guides are veterans. He had so much knowledge about Cambodia's recent history (past 40 years) and stayed with me at the end to answer all of my questions related to Cambodia and their present circumstances. As I had no prior knowledge on Cambodia, it was very eye opening and informative. Remember, the tour guides are volunteers and the museum runs on donations and your small admission fee. Of course it will not look like the National Museum, but it is still very worthwhile and you'll gain lots of information. A must see in Siem Reap for responsible tourism. SN: I did offer a small donation at the end, but was not pressured to do so."

It was, undoubtedly, our favourite visit of our stay in the city. For us, it was far better than our visit to the temples. The museum has a collection of land mines, military munitions, tanks and air craft which were interesting. That said, what made our visit particularly impactful was the free guide (\"Tom\"), whose services came as a part of our $5 admission (tips after the tour are shared amongst guides).Tom was an eye-witness of the Cambodian civil war. He lost his family at 12 years old, whilst attempting to flee to a Thai refugee camp, and he subsequently lost his arm to a land mine during his time as a 14-year-old solider. Meeting Tom was the highlight of our stay because he offered a thoughtful and though-provoking presentation about the war. He answered our historical questions, and also our questions about the lasting impact of the war on Cambodia. It was a real honour for him to take the time to guide us. The museum employs a number of former soldiers, like Tom, who were the victims of land mines. I would rate this as the #1 attraction in Siem Reap and would encourage all visitors to go. "

A trip to Siem Reap just seeing the temples is remarkably incomplete. You must make it over here to more fully understand the complexity of its history.

Forego a coffee or a drink and you can pay for it. The return on the money is INSANE.You get a free guide to walk through the experience with you. You must take the guide! They are the key to understanding all the museum has to offer! :) Our guide, Silo (I'm not sure if that's how you spell it, I'm sorry!) was just remarkable. Though not a veteran, he learned immense amounts about the war from his father. We were able to talk with some of the veterans at the end anyway so it was truly the best of both worlds! It was INCREDIBLE to hear Silo's perspective as a youth in Cambodia ready to turn the country around. It's interesting that all these artifacts are not perfectly preserved as many people are used to when visiting a museum. Perhaps Cambodia is more eager to move on, even forget, the past than we realize. Must must must! Like I said, I don't understand the negative reviews in the slightest. This was the highlight of my trip! Skip a day of temples and make this a priority but be sure to get a guide :)"

First we met the general manager Richard who like us was Dutch and had lived in Amsterdam too. We had a nice conversation about the museum. He was very passionate about his job and the museum. He wants the best for the people that work there. It was great to talk to Richard. The museum is very well maintained. You can follow a route or freely look around. There are a lot of tanks, planes, mines and weapons that were used during the war, to see and you are allowed to touch the weapons if you like. Also there are a lot of photos of the war, the war victims and of the places where they have found the tanks.A young man guided us during our visit. With his stories everything you saw, came alive. He was very young, the youngest guide, we later heard, but he also had already suffered a lot. His stories about the war in Cambodia were very impressive and it made me feel sad. But I am very grateful for this experience to talk to someone that has experienced the war. I think more promotion of this museum would be wise to attract more people. Because I think this museum is a must see for people visiting Siem Reap. Also I would recommend the system to the museum to give people the opportunity to become friends of the museum and support the museum."

Excellent experience for those who want to dive into Cambodia's horrible past when the nation got under attack by North Vietnam/Russia (and consequently by the US) and the Khmer Rouge/China later. A war between systems for regional influence followed by a barbaric Communist death cult that killed a quarter of the Khmer population. The Museum does a great job in visualizing this dark younger history. Lots of tanks (some still contain remains of the killed crew), heavy guns and light guns - the latter may be handled. Also a Chinese MIG-19 copy in the colors of the Khmer Rouge is parked there. We had a very knowledgeable young guide with fluent English.

Its rusting artifacts of war and fading photographs of victims tell the horror of the thirty years of warfare in Cambodia. There are no skulls no dramatic footage of suffering and pain. Simply the mute testimony of the lives of everyday soldiers who died and of the everyday people who were their victims. The tanks and armored vehicles are not maintained as monuments to valor and glory but as simple reminders of suffering and pain without achievement or reason.Most of the victims of mines and genocide were killed by their fellow Cambodians, but at every stage of the war out side powers -- France, Japan, United States, Russia, China, and Vietnam -- each played a bloody role in different years.Unfortunately printed guides often encourage people to come here to hold the weapons of the past and make outrageous photographs. And every day, that is what happens.We were hardly there more than ten minutes when a van load of young Australians assaulted the museum, each racing to grab a weapon for the silliest photo they could make. They seemed unaware that the vehicles around them still contained the burned shoes and torn uniforms of lives lost in the war."

Admission was 5$ and comes with a free tour guide, but this was no ordinary tour guide. His name was Tom and he had experienced all the horrors of the Cambodian war/genocide. He lost his arm and his entire family at a very young age. His stories were the most authentic/unfortunate imaginable. I highly recommend going here if you want a first-person account of the tragedies that happened in Cambodia. It was truely heartbreaking but gave me a much greater appreciation for my own life that I am blessed with."

War Museum Cambodia wasn't really part of my itinerary when I went to Siem Reap last March because I hate sad stories and Cambodia's history was full of those. Throughout my stay, I directed all my activities to arts and food. But on my last afternoon there, I missed the shuttle bus to the Silk farm so I had to find other options not to waste time in Cambodia therefore, I decided to go to the museum. Despite being hesitant at first, I was glad I did go there. It was a window where you could see snippets of what happened to Cambodia's past.The Catch - Their tour guides are survivors with personal experienced of the war. (though I didn't get the chance to talk to one of them because no one was available when I went there. however, their manager, Richard was kind enough to do the tour instead. I didn't just learn about the stuffs on war but also on so many other things inside Cambodia and the world as he himself is a well-traveled guy.) If you're into war stuffs, I'm pretty sure you'll be amazed on the things displayed there especially the customized and homemade weapons. I, myself was impressed how man's mind work and create horrible things.Wishlist: A video presentation before the tour would be helpful. Just a short clip with a summary of Cambodia's history and what to expect on the tour. (I had this when I was in Ho Chi Minh City and it was helpful)Getting there:From the Night Market, I took a Tuktuk and paid US$5 for the round trip."

Our guide (nicknamed the crazy guide) told us of having his father killed in front of him, being forced to fight for the Khmer Rouge, and losing his leg to a land mine. He did so with no political bias (unlike at Vietnam's museum), and seemingly no malice toward the super powers Cambodia has so often been caught between. It was clear his motivation was to tell as many people as possible about the true costs of war and to promote peace.If you come, do not turn down the offer of a free tour guide.

The guide provided a clear and factual narrative and answered our few questions about the political climate. Much time was devoted to the problem of landmines and there is an extensive display of the types of landmines used from the Vietnam War to the war with the Khmer Rouge. Our visit was sobering and insightful, an important revelation about contemporary Cambodia after days in the Angkor Wat temples.If you visit, be sure to tip the guide well. They earn it and their work there at the museum is important."

Our guide had become a boy soldier at the age of 14 until 24, and had lost a number of his family due to the war. Although most of us are aware of the 4 years from 1975, I was shocked to see how much of the weapons were still in use until 1999, and it also gives you an idea of the scale of the cost to the Cambodian people which still owes \u00a3100million to Russia and still has 1 million land mines to clear.The kids enjoyed playing on the weapons and holding the guns but were def more aware of the less glamourous side to war by the time we had finished, very glad we took the time to visit here.

A $2 tuk-tuk ride from Siem Reap gets you to this open-air museum.The entrance fee at the time of writing was $5 pp - which is a little high given the very poor quality of the exhibits. The quality of the free guide is the only thing that gives this attraction any merit. The attractions themselves are uncared for, rusty and have definitely seen better days (or even better years!). The guide we had was OK. He was an ex-Khmer Rouge soldier who had lived through the '75 revolution and then continued fighting from Thailand after the Vietnamese ousted Pol Pot in 1978. The standard of English was passable but not great which weakened what was obviously an otherwise harrowing and interesting story. The ex Khmer Rouge soldiers tend to paint themselves as victims in cambodia's history rather than taking responsibility for the atrocities perpetrated by them. As such, bear in mind what information you get while it may be factually correct is also biased - perpetrating the view of the Khmer soldiers as a brain washed group of \"innocents\", not entirely responsible for their actions. A view I certainly struggled with having previously visited S-21 & the killing fields of Phnom Penh."

If you just go there to wander among the exhibits, you are not going to learn much from this visit, as the most educational element is a guided tour, performed by Cambodian army veteran, which is free of charge and is truly a highlight of the visit. Ex-soldiers will tell you personal stories of fights against the Khmer Rogue and about the life of landmine victims, which most of them belong to. For us, it was a truly emotional experience and a very educational one. On top of this, this is one of those museums, where most of the exhibits don't have \"do not touch signs\", so you can hold and take a picture with arms like AK-47 Kalashnikov, M16, grenade launchers or RPGs."

I personally found this rather disturbing to see the boys in my family having so much 'fun' and joking around with these weapons in front of a man who had just explained to use the horrors he had endured....but sadly, he didn't seem to mind as much as I did.After this, we went on to the land mine display and explanation, and then a tour of the 'armour graveyard'. Most of the armour on display is very badly damaged and not restored in any way. My husband said it was sad that they had not been preserved in any way, but he still managed to take over 150 snaps for 'reference'.I think we spent a good 1.5hrs here, my husband probably would have spent more, but we had other plans for the day and had to move on. My young boys enjoyed being able to climb up onto the tanks etc and pose for photos.At the end, of course, our 'free' guide explained that they volunteered their services and any 'tips' would be appreciated........"

You can get better value from the Cambodian Landmine Museum and the Vietnam War Museum. Be careful of tuk tuk drivers who overprice rides. We found Khmer tuk tuk drivers to be very welcoming, honest and accommodating, so stick with them. We stumbled upon one tuk tuk driver who looked Indian who tried to take advantage of our supposed naivete, good thing there was a Khmer driver near."

We took a tuk-tuk from the Angkor National Museum to the War Museum which only cost us US$3 and got more than we ever expected from this place!!Despite the terrible atrocities that the Cambodia people and it's country endured less than half a century ago, this is the only War Museum in the whole country. If you come to Siem Reap please make the effort to go to the War Museum. For US$5 you can look around by yourself or you can be taken around by a guide. Our guide was Tom, a lovely, soft spoken Cambodian man who grew up near Siem Reap. Tom lived through the Khmer Rouge, lost his family when he was 12 and his left arm to a landmine not long after. Tom gave us an insight into this conflict that you can only get from a person who was there. All of the guides at the musuem are victims of the war. Like Tom many of his colleagues have also suffered the loss of a limb. Because of this, Tom and his fellow colleagues are no longer employable in the normal job market. However, the War Museum shows that they have a lot to offer and we have a lot to learn from them!!! So if you are in Siem Reap please visit the War Museum, and keep Tom and his friends in a job.

First off, I can probably see where the bad comments come from, if you were to just walk around this place with no guide or a poor guide, yes it would most likely be just average.I barely even saw most of the items as the entire time I was asking my guide questions and he gave me great answers as to his life, his kids life and what it's like dealing with PTSD and post war problems. At one point, the guy literally sat down with me, and we chatted while my gf (who wasn't into the war exhibits as much as I was)and he and I just talked about stuff he remembered.I will say, yes these guys are doing this as work. And yes, they are probably underpaid. The problem comes when you have to distinguish if donating at the end is worth it or not. My guide never once asked for money, never gave me some sob story about how he needs to feed family etc.. I willingly asked about how the govt compensates veterans and he said matter of factly that pensions are usually about 30$ a month for some, himself included. He talked about the struggles of being alone and how he only recently started sharing his story with his kids. I ended with a 5$donation that I approached him about. Not the other way around(o can agree I'd feel odd if approached by them about it.)Overall, whether I got lucky with the guide or not, I had goosebumps half the time talking to him, and because of that this may have been my favourite place after 4 months in Asia."

Cost about 7 USD by Tuk Tuk to and fro.I took up a tour guide by the name of Huo (not too sure on the spelling). The majority of the tour guides in the museum are former soldiers and mostly mine victims. This is one of the few jobs provided to them and if you take the time to ask them about their lives and how it was in the war, you will gain a greater understanding and sympathy towards what the Cambodian people has gone through.By learning about the history first hand, I find it an invaluable experience and information. The exhibitions are mostly rusted out due to the low budget of the museum. The exhibits are not properly cared for.However, when you do do this trip I would advise taking on a guide to give you info about the museum and ask them personally about the hardships they have to go through.A little tip also go a long way as like most people in Cambodia, they earn very little.All in all, a worthwhile trip. I would advise people to go visit!"

This was a really difficult thing to argue with, but I wish they would have told us about this before we paid 5dollars entry. We walked around on our own for about 15minutes, but to be honest: unless you like to look at rusty tanks and guns, it is super borring.Then we sat down a bit at the entrance and talked to the guide and we started asking him questions about the war, and for some reason he decided to give us a small tour anyway. The 15min. we spend with him were super interesting and moving. He told about the machines, there history, but most important answered all our questions about the war, the museum and modern cambodia.My advice: This place is really interesting and I would recommend people to go, but only with a guide, which means you have to go earlier in the day, while the guides can still walk."

I would question anyone who is not moved by this experience. Thom gave a very informative history of Cambodia in the Pol Pot regime which was extraordinary. If you want to see shiny tanks, guns etc and a glossy view of Cambodia then go somewhere else. This has authentic, real equipment and photos with guides whom have first hand experience and you cannot get any better than that. A true living museum.

Hubby being a war history buff, we were all in.Admission was only $5, and that included a free tour guide if we wanted one. We opted to start the tour on our own.We were just a bit disappointed because there's very little written information anywhere in the museum. The grounds are filled with rusting tanks, missiles, guns and signs containing info about when the piece was built, who built it, how big, how many millimeters, when it was found, etc. But we were hoping for political history.There's irony in the fact that all the rusting weaponry is positioned for display in a beautiful mango grove.Several museum structures house walls of photographs. The general theme is Pol Pot's \"killing fields\" and land mine victims. Dozens of photos of limbless adults and children shock your senses in living color, as do piles of skeletal skulls and limbs of the millions of Cambodians murdered by the Khmer Rouge regime 1975-79.Equally shocking are dozens more pictures of 7-10 year old children smiling for the camera while holding weapons, which might have been used to shoot their own parents in exchange for Pol Pot's promise of plentiful food,We later learned that 50% of Cambodians today are under age 22 because half the adults in the country were butchered by Pol Pot. We also learned that Cambodia is still the third highest ranked country in the world for active land mine hazards.After we'd covered the grounds on foot, we stopped in the meager souvenir shop. Several books are available for $8-9 US, which do relate Cambodia's recent political history. You can also buy the documentary \"The Killing Fields\" on DVD. And you can buy a T-shirt inscribed with a skull and \"DANGER Land Mines\" I recommend seeing this museum, but first do a little research on the history of Lon Nol and Pol Pot so you have a better background going in. Your experience will be more meaningful."

I would think most of the machinery is 60 years old or more, and Cambodia being a tropical climate, metal rusts with the monsoon season, and over many years.

True to what the advertising literature says he is an ex-soldier and is a landmine victim. He was very factual and open about the use of landmines during the various wars and Pol Pot regime and there is series of display boards in relation to the killing fields era. From our brief experiences in Siem Reap provided you struck up a rapport with whoever, especially the guide in this instance and our tuktuk driver, a lot more family history of the Killing Fields era comes to light, which then makes the displays even more chillingThe small landmine exhibit was interesting and you forget how long landmine clearance has been going on because they had photos of Princess Diana and Prince Harry in Cambodia in respect of landmine clearance.There is a little shop there"

I was given a one on one tour with Bik Hour and he was MORE than willing to chat with me about the intricacies surrounding the Kmher Rouge and the effects of war on Cambodia. He even hosted me for lunch at a nearby spot and spoke to me about life in Cambodia! If you are looking to get some great photos, learn about the historical significance of the country you are residing in, and connect with a local over some pretty heartfelt stories, then come to the War Museum."

Our guide Suon Rottama spoke very good English, was caught up in the war, had landmine injuries and spoke from the heart with great dignity and from personal experience of these ghastly war times. My recommendation is that you don't look around on your own. It will just be a hardware experience. The guided tour is not to be missed and while we did not have to wait at all, I'd say it's worth waiting up to two hours for a guide. The hardware armoury held my interest for only 10 minutes but I didn't go there for that, I went there to learn. It is the guide's stories that are powerful, compelling and important to learn about and from."

It's arranged in an outdoor field setting with small pavilions housing displays and photos. There are tons of artifacts, especially artillery and tanks, throughout the museum grounds. Definitely take the (free) guided tour. My guide had very interesting personal experiences to share and it helped me see a more personal side of the country's history. It would be best to come with questions as the tour is rather short (about 30-45min) and the museum isn't busy at all (I was the only person there on my visit) but it did make for a very personal experience."

Since 1970, Cambodia had almost three decades of civil war. \"I didn't want to be a soldier, but I had no choice!\" he emphasized. At age 22, his military career came to an abrupt end when he stepped on a land mine amidst a heavy crossfire between his 15-man platoon and an unknown number of Khmer Rouge soldiers. \"They were so many of them, and I just saw my best friend died before a land mine brew my right leg off!\" It was around one in the afternoon, he recalled, on July 3rd 1995 in the Chong Kal District in northern Cambodia -- the date and place that changed his life forever. Bik left the military with no service medals. His only award, if you can say so, was a cheap prosthetic leg that gave him permanent discomfort and pain. Nevertheless, he considered himself extremely lucky as many of his friends did not live to see the end of the war in 1998 with the death of Pol Pot, the demoniacal Khmer Rouge leader. Desperately poor and unable find a job because of his handicap, he would work any job that pays the next meal and, if he was lucky, give him a place to stay. And for about ten years before joining the War Museum, he was a tuk tuk (an auto three-wheeler) driver. It earned him a meager income that allowed him to live day-by-day. Despite that, he managed to pick up some working English to communicate with tourists.Last year, an old war buddy told him that the War Museum in Siem Reap was hiring, preferably of a veteran who could speak some English. The museum was small, under-funded and rather poorly maintained. It paid USD50 a month plus accommodation in the museum. But to Bik, it was a dream job. \"I also earn tips from tourists if I do a good job,\" he said cheerfully. And that averaged about USD100 a month. With a steady salary, he's on a mission! He vouched to work there until he has to retire telling people who cared to listen about the horror of war. He showed them the many instruments of killing including the type of land mine that took his leg and pictures of victims under the Khmer Rouge regime and during the civil war. To many visitors, it was their first impression of the atrocity of war. And yes, he said, \"some people cry hearing my story.\"The annual Nobel Peace Prize recognizes individuals who make significant contribution to peace. Regretfully, Pik will never be considered. But let's not forget, it's people like him from all corners around the world who work tirelessly, with little reward and no recognition, to tell us about their cruelty of war. This essay is written with a special dedication to Mr. Bik Hour who awakes in us that peace should never be taken for granted."

He lost his arm at 14 years of age when a land mine exploded and his stories are truly heartbreaking. He wanted to be a tour guide but they refused him as he wasn't a \"whole man\" in their words and he wouldn't be able to carry tourists bags.... So he now volunteers as a guide at the war museum and only lives off donations.

The museum itself is an open field displaying many destroyed army equipment such as tanks, artilleries, mortars, etc. surrounded by barracks. If I would just go by myself, I would just look at those equipment and go out with disappointment. I found a message \u201cfree guide is available\u201d at the entrance, so I asked for help. He took us to one of the barracks and found that it displayed lots of pictures. He took us through several barracks all displaying pictures and real land mine, guns, shells, etc. He explained what happened to the country and its people during Pol Pot / Khmer Rouge regime, and how the country remains poor and struggling to restore the land and helping victims. My guide was one of the victim by anti-personnel land mine and he lost one leg. His father was the victim of massacre as well. I saw a couple of other guides also did not have leg or arm. So, my recommendation is that you need guide who is very knowledgeable about the history and the museum display. Otherwise, you may not learn the most important message from this museum. The museum wasn\u2019t like to have enough fund to maintain and update the contents, but this is one of the important place to maintain for the world peace. His word \u201call weapons are bad. They are made to kill people\u201d still remain heavy in my heart. This is simple truth which many people knows but doesn\u2019t want to face its reality."

Having been to the famous war museum at Ho Chi Minh city in Vietnam some years ago, I just about swore off any kind of such places in the future where I was simply revolted by the rhetoric and glorification of war. This war museum in Siem Reap however, is a completely different kettle of fish.It was an easy afternoon where our tuk-tuk driver suggested the war museum. I was not interested at all however, we did go in the end and it was an enlightening experience for me. The museum looked more like an open air park with displays set up in a shack like structures with old planes, tanks and heavy vehicles from USA, Russia and China on display in the middle of the area, depicting the conflict era from the 60's and 70's.Unlike most war museums, everything featured here were stockpiles of old and rusty machines of war which included guns, bombs and land mines. There is a US$5 entrance fee per person and it comes with a free guide for the tour. Interestingly, all the guides were war veterans who suffered some sort of disability such loss of limbs.Our guide Soon, came forward with a slight limp and offered to take us on the tour. He was dressed in army fatigues and I did not know what to expect. He spoke very good English although he apologised for his \"poor\" command. When asked, he said he endeavoured to learn English as much as possible so that visitors could understand him clearly.Soon was \"conscripted\" into the military at the age of 14 which also saw his parents killed before his eyes. He pointed to my 12 year old nephew and remarked that he was very fortunate not to have to experience such atrocities in life. It was stirring and moving as Soon described his life or the lack of quality of life rather with virtually lack of emotion or so I thought. Soon began to show the different land mines and how they worked, I could visualise the cruelty that man has created to maim and kill other human beings.At the end of the tour which took about 30mins, Soon sometimes looked vamp and unemotional as if just telling a story but I could see the emotional scars left on him and the rest of the veterans. However, I was left feeling shaken and then enlightened with a positive message from Soon that war serves no purpose and no benefit.This \"boneyard\" of machines may look very sorry looking and dull but the revelation is in the people working there, promoting a very important message for all of us to share."

Lots had been written about the 'free' guides but surely any well-traveled tourist should know better. For me, my guide was the 'main attraction'. His accounts of his life from a child soldier to a veteran fighting for different sides and his post-war trauma were believable. We chatted as we strolled around the place. He did mention that his income came solely from tips but at no time did he asked directly or pressured me to make a donation. In short, if you just wished to take some snapshots posing in front of a tank or other military hardware, I suggest that you give this place a miss. However, if you want a wider perspective of that very turbulent period or having visited the Killing Fields or S-21 in Phnom Penh, then a visit will provide a clearer picture of the events from 1970s till the 1990s."

I would think that many a foreign tourist after having a tour from Keo Visna, have seen first hand, the affects of \"Post Traumatic Stress Disorder\". And yet Cambodian Govt. soldiers fighting the Khmer Rouge, retired, have no psychological support at all, due to the ravishing affects the war had on a country built from scratch afterwards, unfortunately! They only have each other! A highly recommended experience with Keo Visna!"

This museum wasn't part of my \"tour-list\" before I visited Siem Reap Cambodia, but boy, was I glad that my tuk-tuk driver recommended this place to me. When I got there, a war veteran tour guide welcomed me and asked If I wanted to listen to his experience during the war, he started talking about his life and the history of the Cambodian war. He also mentioned about the how Cambodia is doing as a country today. This was a great learning experience for me and I think that you'll find it amazing to hear their stories and get to see and even touch all the machinery they used during the war. This museum is Awesome! Please visit. This is real stuff!"

The guide is a must. He took us to an area where there were information boards and explained to us about the war which we knew nothing about.He told us his story and it was certainly from the heart and an eye opener. Guy lost his arm, family and everything he owned. The museum is sad in the fact that the tanks, guns etc are left to rot but to be honest they are making the most of what they've got. His story's and explanation of the area, weapons were spot on and we both really enjoyed it.At the end of the tour we gave him a donation which he happily accepted then he left us to do our own thing. No problem or harassment at all.Well worth a visit. It certainly is no great museum and I feel sad that in the future the weapons and machinery will go to waste but with no funding they really are making the most of what they've got. Definetly a must visit but get a guide!"

The things I was attracted to were the guns you can hold, pose and take a picture with and the cute stray puppies playing around the place. It took me 10 mins to finish the tour(I cut short cause i didn see a point reading the \"signs\" that I don't understand) and I feel like I wasted my 5usd at the end. I wouldn't say not to visit this place but I think unless you can ensure that there's a guide for you when you are there, you're better off not going because its a little off the city and it'll cost you quite a bit for the tuktuk trip there and back."

After our tour, we had some questions but did not want to interrupt his tour so we approached another war veteran sitting near the entrance. Unfortunately, he did not speak English but our TukTuk driver came to the rescue and acted as our interpreter. Even though there was a language barrier, the veteran's willingness to entertain our questions was evident as he told us of his experiences and the extreme efforts to find missing family members after the war.I would strongly recommend other travellers to make a visit to this museum as there is so much more to Cambodian history than the magnificence of Angkor Wat."

That pissed me off and I simply walk away and decided to tour it on my own. The whole site is not crowded (less than 10 tourists including us) and there are a bunch of \"war veterans\" sitting there drinking and playing cards. These people just need to be more genuine and sincere to get their tips but they don't seems to bother.The whole site is filled with metal junks which are left out under the severe weather, heat and rain over the years. There are small huts with those old weapons which anyone can touch freely. I am sure some can even steal it without being noticed. There are some printed old photos with plain explanation pasted on boards but all in very poor condition.It is a pity that those are valuable history for the country but were left to rot.

We've been throughout Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia for a couple of months - this museum is on the top of our list.People who have given this place a terrible/poor rating have obviously just quickly walked through the place, without a guide, and aren't impressed by its small size and weathered displays.The thing that did it for us was the \"free\" (donations greatly appreciated) guided tour by one of the few veterans of the civil war. Ours had his right leg blown off by a land mine, two bullet wounds to his other leg, and a bullet wound in his stomach which had taken out his gall-bladder. After his parents and siblings were killed, when he was 13, he joined the army. Even through all this, he joked that he didn't do much in the war, as he spent most of the time in hospital beds!!When travelling, I always find the most rewarding experiences to be those where you learn and experience something about the local culture/history directly from the locals. That is why this museum is so good."

Entry was US$5, which we are told goes towards the upkeep of the museum, as well as to the war veterans who run it. Many of the war veterans were injured during the war, and you see them around the entrance of the museum dressed in their uniforms, but missing limbs. A guide for the tour is free, but donations are appreciated (which we were happy to give as well). Our tour is conducted by one of the above mentioned war veterans, who shared about his own personal experiences and also about how he lost his arm. Was amazed by how he managed to keep his sense (dark) humor despite the horrors he experienced. The weaponry and machines displayed here may not be as impressive as those of other museums, but the stories the guides have to tell are worth a listen."

The contributors obviously went there thinking that they were going to see a museum on a scale and size such as ones in maybe Hanoi or Ho Chin Minh City. Do not go with the expectation of something comparable. It's not. The contributors couldn't have talked to any of the guides there either otherwise they would have learned some very important facts, i.e. this museum is basically a small, privately owned facility set up by solders discharged from the Cambodian Army, for the most part with severe injuries and NO financial compensation from the Cambodian Government. Go spend some time with, for example, one of the guides Suon Rottana who was forced into the army by the Khmer Rouge at the age of 14 years and who had his two parents shot in front of him when they resisted..... discharged after 20 years, only one leg after a landmine took the other one, no payout or 'superannuation'... he like others at the museum survive on what they can glean from visitor entry fees. Or go talk to Suon's friend....no legs and confined to a wheel chair, again after a landmine incident. Yes, the museum is a little disorganised, but they have some interesting military hardware and weapons and a sad illustration of the bad days in Cambodia under the terrible rule of Khmer Rouge. Visit, talk and learn. It a valuable 1 - 2 hours of your time at Siem Reap."

We had also herd alot about scamming at the gate. We arrived and we were the only people there and there was no signs if anyone trying to scam us. Just the one ticket booth.Upon walking in we were approached by a lovely man asking if we would like a guide, Mr Keo. He said there is no cost just that it would be appreciated if we made a donation after. We agreed to have him as our guide and it was definitely worth it.Without a guide the museum is more of a collection of artefacts from the war, so I would reccommend if you go there get a guide. Mr Keo was a very gentle person who had unfortunately been through alot. He had scars and 3 fingers missing from where he had experienced mines blowing up. He took us around explaining what everything was, telling us general information about the war but most memorably he shared his storey with us. He talked about how his parents were killed and he joined for food at the age of 16. He spoke of his friends, many of which died and even showed us a T 54 where one of his friends were blown up still containing remenants of his bones. He also told us of his general life and day to day hardships.At the end of the tour he was not pushy but only said any donations we gave would go toward helping his boy (an landmine orphan who he takes care of as he has no wife or children of his own) we gave him 15 but would have loved to give hundreds. I feel that without him this would have been a fairly mediocre experience but I am greatful that I got the time to meet and talk with Mr Keo and appreciate him sharing his storey with us, whilst it is very obvious how much it had afftected him by the pain in his eyes. I would definitely go back and have this experience again and I intend to on my next visit in the hopes to speak to him again. Do the meuseum and ask for MR Keo as your guide!"

In a place where wet season/monsoon rains prevail for a better part of the year, it is impossible to keep these pieces of used war material up to 30 years old in some cases, in shining condition. It is far from a modern day \"New Car Sales Lot\". A little insensitive is my thinking.Secondly: My review! There is nothing better or therapeutic than having a beer with Old Soldiers! Albeit they were not drinking beer because they were working - I was. Cold beer is available from their shop. Nice on a hot day after a tour and explanation of the horrors that gripped this country. Through my guide Sna, I was astonished (even after researching what I thought to be decent research) that the civil war didn't end in 1979 and the end of the Pol Pot Regime - IT ESCALATED and continued until 1998! The Khmer Rouge still having enough backing and power to resist Phnom Penh until this time.After Sna's very honest and at times heartbreaking account of the civil war, I was emotionally and physically beaten, so I opted for a very cold Heineken from their shop store. I was invited to sit with some of the guides, Sna, Mr Khom and Mr Ratanna. The sense of humour these old soldiers display after the horrors of combat astounded me! Genuine, lovely people who made me laugh until I was crying, with their highly developed and combined sense's of humour!This is a MUST see, DO ask for a guide! You will definitely appreciate how lucky you are after hearing first hand accounts of what it would be like to face and stare death in the face - EVERYDAY! It will make you appreciate your own life so much more. If you are up to it, you can even ask Mr Khom and Mr Ratanna to show you how to play Cambodian Chess if they are not busy.Mr Khom will say he is the best, Mr Ratanna will strongly oppose his opponent!

It was simply breathtaking.The museum itself consists of a great deal of deactivated mines, some armored vehicles used during the wartime as well as some exploded bombs. They even have an helicopter and a Chinese airplane. They also have a large amount of pictures of the killing fields and khmer soldiers. I guess that the most valuable part of the visit was being able to hear the stories from a person who actually suffered the atrocities of the war. As far as I can tell, there were several guides in the museum in the same case.It is an experience that makes you think."

I'm not looking to see everything shiny new as it's all come from wars but I think they need to at least apply some preservation to everything if they want it to still be view-able in another 20 years!Anyway, the number of vehicles, plus the helicopter (very impressive and way larger than expected!) and the fighter jet make this very worthwhile. I didn't take a guide as I was with my 3 year old daughter and don't want to traumatize her with having to explain why there are limbs missing. I don't feel a guide is necessary here anyway because most exhibits are well labeled, sometimes with a tiny snipped of background information that makes it interesting, such as where they found a tank and some more context.Finally worth a mention is that they don't seem bothered about people interacting with exhibits. I wouldn't recommend climbing all over them but there was no one or no sign saying you can't. This includes the hand held weapons, so if you are not feeling too solemn and sober then why not pick one up for a photo op?Did I say the fighter jet (Chinese made Mig if I remember correctly) was really cool and a rare to see find?"

This place is a lesson in the horrors of brutalities of civil war. He explained the weapons, how they were used and in partcular the different types of land mines and the injuries that they inflicted, he himself has some fingers missing and ball bearing in his body. Do not feel that it is a depressing place, it isn't; it is in many ways an example of the powers of human strength in the face of appaling mental and physical injuries. I felt that his description of the realities were a cathartic experience for him and indeed some of the stories are not ones that anyone could possibly recover from. It is well worth going if only to contribute in some small was to some people's recovery and to learn about this aspect of Cambodian history first hand."

Which was interesting but not very informative. As I was walking out I saw a foreigner talking (and it seemed quite in-depth) to another of the 'guides'. I didn't want to be rude and interrupt but maybe not all the guides were as useless as mine!Give it a go if you're interested and you have a half hour/hour to kill, but don't break your back getting there.Probably not a good place for prams/children who are likely to wander as it is not paved and doesn't have any enclosures around the displays."

Before we even got down from our van, we saw 2 guides entertaining two groups of visitors that arrived 2 mins before us. One left with 2 ppl, the other one was left with 3 others. I could be wrong, but i swear i saw the last guide gave our van a look, saw that more ppl are coming, and he tried to hurried the 3 tourists to follow him so as not to let us catch up with them. Why I suspected this? coz as he was pulling one tourist's arm to hurry him along, that tourist actually turned back and pointed at us, as if telling him that he should wait for us as well, since we just arrive and he's the only guide left. The guide shook his head and continue to tug at the tourist's arm, encouraging him to move on. At this point, we've actually walked up to their group, and by all means, this guide avoided eye contact with us, as if we werent there.We were stunned, as we've checked the office and it was empty, and thinking that this last guide would be the one leading. Anyway, we kept to ourselves and started taking pix on our own. After about 2 mins, the guide finally came over, asking where we are from. Our answer made him rolled his eyes (I WONDER WHY), and very reluctantly, he asked if we want to join the other three. Of coz we said yes. But what happened next was unacceptable to us. He didnt introduce himself, didnt look at us when he talked and didnt care if we couldnt hear him. All the while, he talked only to that three tourists, and from the first stop he moved to the next, without waiting for us. There were 5 of us in our group, and since we were walking behind, he didnt bother to wait for all before started talking bout the exhibits! is that what a tour guideshould do? The next thing shocked us. Only at the 2nd stop, he was mad that my friend was still snapping pix behind, he actually scolded us and said we should pay attention to him if we want to follow his group! This is plain rude, coz first of all, we were all in a large group, so even taking pix takes time too. And it was only the 2nd stop! And like i said, he acted as if we werent there at all, so why said we werent focusing when he didnt even acknowledge our existence? Some how it just confirmed my suspicion that he wasnt happy we tagged along in the first place.I just told him to go ahead with his group, and we would be more than happy to walk on our own.Other travellers mentioned as well, the place isnt well-kept, and many of those exhibits are in very poor condition. With the $ from our entrance fee, more could've been done. Even photos and charts on the noticeboards seemed to be printed ages ago, at least that would have been the easiest to keep i supposed, if tanks and guns and the other metals go rusty easily!will not go back (so forget bout the saying if u pay $20, it's for life, coz that's a cheat. im sorry to that visitor that got robbed $20 coz i only paid $5)"

But you would be missing out on understanding the livelihoods and context of Cambodia, if you didn't visit the war museum, which is only a 10 minute tuk tuk drive from downtown. The entrance fee is $3 and opening hours is 7:30am-5:30pm. If you visit the war museum, be sure to ask for their volunteer tour guide. All are ex-soldiers so they personally lived through the war. The volunteer tour guides gets a base salary of $50/month, so they mostly live on tips. I was fortunate to have Mr. Keo Veasna be my tour guide. He joined the Cambodian army to fight against the Khmer Rouge when he was 15 years old and most of the items in the war museum were collected in his home town, so he told many personal stories. Veasna lost both his parents when he was two years old because Pol Pot's regime was killing a lot of people towards the end of his regime. He was adopted by a man who became his godfather, but when his godfather passed away, he joined the army. Veasna is able to tell you what each weapon is, where it's manufactured, and also personal stories of how many of his friends died or got disabled during the war. I couldn't believe when Veasna told me his friend died in one of the tanks that were on display. He collected his friend's bone and displayed it on the tank because he wanted to share with others his friend was a good man, who shared his food with others during the war. Veasna asked me when I thought the Khmer Rouge war ended. I told him 1979. I was shocked to learn that the war officially ended in 1999! Pol Pot died in 1998 of heart attack and the Khmer Rouge official surrendered in 1999. That was only a little bit more than a decade ago. After Veasna left the army, he heard about the war museum and decided to work there because he wanted to spread the word to prevent future wars. He started as a cleaner, but with the small tips tourists gave him, he went to study English and now speaks fluent English after taking 1 hr lessons every day for a year. Please visit the war museum when you're in Siem Reap, and request for their volunteer tour guides, especially Keo Veasna. It's really a worthwhile visit and you won't regret it."

Dozens of authentic guns used in the war, from WWII to late Vietnam era Russian and American weapons. The star of the show was the guide however. I regret that I have forgot his name. Our guide had only one arm, having lost the other to a claymore mine during the Cambodian war. He was a war veteran and a child soldier, and the war stories he told us (Emergency IV administered with coconuts, wire saw amputations) were amazingly vivid and made the museum's exhibits seem a lot more real. He apparently was also personally responsible for recovering some of the artefacts displayed in the museum, for example the Katyusha missile truck with bullet holes in the drivers side. The dead driver's hip bone is still inside the truck! Apparently he was chained to his vehicle when they found his truck at the Thai border. Having a war vet as a guide made the trip really worthwhile. The museum loses one star for the poor condition of the outdoor exhibits (tanks, BMPs, an Mi 18 and a MiG19) though. This museum should have its exhibits properly restored!"

Its little away from the city, there is an admission fee if $5. From my point of view, rather than a museum, it looks like a village house where a lot of war leftover scraps were kept. It is not arranged in an order, but only scraps, scraps and scraps. I've seen some cows were tied to the old tanks and lot of kittens playing over the \"shells & mines\" :). The attack by the mosquitoes are severe. For me it looks like a \"family run exhibition (??)\" center.I wouldn't tell anyone not to go but don't have any expectations,I will never go again.

Keo was an absolutely wonderful guide, humble, honest and made me feel like I didn't even deserve to be in his presence. He explained how he felt and just what had happened to him and his fellow soldiers in the past. I looked at the shrapnel in his face and could see the pain and hurt in his eyes. This guy was the real deal. Make you realise what a bubble I live here on the northern beaches of Sydney. I am actually a cop and have some tragedy but this guy just made me feel so humble. I gave him @20.00 and feel I ripped him off $1,000.'s. His insight, frank and honest answers to any questions I had to ask and the truthful, no holds barred answers have left me gob smacked. Do the tour. I was fortunate to have this wonderful 37 year old veteran to myself for over and hour. One of the best things I have ever done in my life, even though it leave me with tears and a heap of mixed emotions. Thanks again Keo.

Our visit (we didn't see another tourist while there) was made worthwhile by our guide who was a victim of a land mind explosion...losing three fingers and still having shrapnel in his face and shoulder which he encouraged us to feel...along with a subtle reminder that he does the tours to raise money to have it removed. The photos on display, while in poor condition were interesting, as was the photo of the guide when he was in the army (I think it was the army??) a much younger person of course complete with guns....there must still be plenty of tragic events swirling around the minds of lots of Cambodians still today, perhaps the drivers or the old lady who serves you in the markets, it's amazing how forgiving the people are.

We had a Cambodian tour guide with us who got us into the museum and then left us to roam around - so we were lucky although the other visitors did seem to have museum \"guides\".The museum deals with a very complex and horrific period in Cambodian history - and to be honest even after reading up on it its still a tad confusing (Other that it seemed to be a Chinese sponsored fraction opposing a Vietnamese sponsored fraction in open warfare). There are a plethora of weaponry on display, ranging from a Mig 19 jet fighter and Main Battle tanks down to small arms, mines, radios and the like. Give the museum due, it has better English signage than many other museums we have visited.In summary if one can shake off the unwanted guides (but give an extra donation if you desire naturally) this is a actually a reasonable museum."

My guide was a participant in the war and had many great and compelling, though often sad, stories to tell. Westerners should visit this place if they are in the area, to have an upclose glimpse of impact of the war on this country. Be prepared to ask for a small gift of assistance at the end, but it means so much more to them than it does to us. That said, don't put more in your pocket when you go, to avoid giving more than you intend to. It becomes hard to say no or limit.

I went to the War Museum and honestly, it was invaluable and incredibly haunting.It is a $5 entry fee, which I think is pretty standard in comparison to alot of other entry fees in Siem Reap. At the gate, we were met by a young Cambodian War Victim, who said he would guide us around for a donation. Saying yes to a guide, for this museum, I think is necessary - you can not understand this museum completely, or comprehend the machines, guns, tanks, military items etc. without the knowledge of someone who has bore wittness and been part of this horrific history. Without a guide, this open-air museum is simply a large number of weapons, military tanks and machinery and nameless photographs. You will not be able to understand what you really are looking at; nor see the real power and story behind each piece. He also explained to us in great detail all the different land mines and how they were used in different ways, for different effects during the war. He also had photographs of himself and others during the war. His knowledge was second-to-none.Our guide told us his own horrific and tragic story, gave us real insight and gave us great explanations of the history of the war and the khmer Rouge regime. He answered whatever questions we wanted to know, and was simply a beautiful person to be around. By taking on this guide, we gave him a donation that will go towards his surgery to remove ballbearings still lodged inside his body (which he showed us), which at the present time, he can not afford. He was modest and kind, and extremely grateful for our donation. All I can say is, ignore any terrible review you read below; be sensitive and respectful here (for example, our guide said many tourists ask him offensive questions, or take silly pictures with the guns, which he has seen have killed thousands of people in the past) and most importantly, do hire a guide. You don't have to give a large donation, but it will make everything so much clearer. If you can, ask for Keo to be your guide; I'm sure you'll be as glad you went as I am."

This museum does not have glitzy reconstructed heroic-looking machinery, it has real time and jungle-worn tanks and guns that give you a much more realistic feel for what those machines really did. It is a much more honest museum than any museum with planes hanging from the ceiling, this is not a hollywood-style hero setup. There is a small area with deactivated land mines that feels eerie to walk across even when you know they are deactivated. We had only a small amount of time left before having to head to the airport and this was a great way to fill our time and get a different perspective on history; none of us are much into war history but we thought we should go and see. This museum was very different in that it didn't display the machines in proud and pristine condition but rather it is an open-air setting with rusty deactivated missiles and tanks, signs that were used to warn people (in Cambodian) of land mines, and veterans that are able to provide a guided tour for only $5USD. There are no gory or sad pictures and yet it was the most sincere and chilling display of war machinery I've seen. For those who are interested in the technical aspects, there are descriptions (hand-written) of where the machines were used, made, their range, etc. It's a very very good display/museum not too far from Siem Reap (10 minutes approximately) and as I say it was interesting even for those without much interest in war museums. There is a very small shop at the end with books and other items, we were free to look without any hassle at all. We did not get the guided tour but wish we had, it was offered to us for $5 when we walked in but we declined and we were not asked again."

There's also a Russian jet and helicopter outside.Guide:Perhaps we were unlucky with our guide, judging by other reviews.His English was good and he pleasantly introduced himself and explained how he lost his left arm. He then explained that he did the guiding for free and couldn't get a job anywhere or any food. He also informed us that there were 50 other men in the museum in a similar position. This is all relevant and I'm sure his problems are representative of most Land Mine victims. Problem was he kept mentioning donations literally every couple of minutes and was constantly applying pressure comparing his life to our lives in the west. He whipped us round a few of the exhibits in about 10 minutes and then finished by suggesting a donation of between $20 and $30 minimum but more was also reasonable. He also requested that we give it directly to him rather than in the boxes labelled 'donation'.We had every intention of making a donation at the end in our own time and what we felt was right but his constant pressure made it really unpleasant.Also...halfway through his suggested donation speech his mobile rang...clearly not too hard up. We left a donation with him...stupidly but when he was standing between the boxes and us it was hard not to.Not sure if this place is associated with a NGO or what but I would visit the land mine museum as this seems to be a professional outfit keen on helping people.

            "review": "DEFINITELY WORTH THE TIME -- VERY MOVING EXPERIENCE!!!. My husband and I went to the War Museum one day by chance -- we were actually looking for the Landmind Museum and the tuk tuk driver misunderstood us and brought us to the War Museum instead. Boy, what a lucky mistake! This place is amazing -- full of old war equipment (missles, land mines, tanks, etc). The part that was the most moving was the tour. Tours are offered for free with a requested small donation of a few U.S. dollars. Our tour guide, like most people in their mid-30s in Cambodia, has suffered not just by losing their parents to the KR, but also then by being dragged into the war, physically becoming disabled by loss of limb and vision, as well as later losing his own wife and daughter to a land mind. Needless to say, spending time with this man was quite an emotional experience -- he was very detailed and honest about the details of the last 30 years of civil war in his country, as well as specifically how it affected him. Also, because of his military background, he knew EVERYTHING about the pieces on display. A guide is not necessary as there are signs in English that you can read as you walk around, but we highly recommend asking for a guide and taking the time to really take in the small little outdoor museum. We were very grateful for the chance to see it! Expect to spend anywhere from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours here (we were there for a little over an hour)."

            "review": "Great place to visit. The admission price of $3 per person was well worth it for what the place has to offer. However, if they would clean it up, paint the equipment, and put ladders on the equipment so that tourists could climb inside the tanks, helicopter, and plane, they could charge more. Most of the equipment is either Chinese or Russian. There's a huge old Soviet helicopter and aircraft setting outside and the tanks, howitzers, and artillery pieces are setting inside. They are old and rusting but still interesting to see. There are sheds where there are rifles, machine guns, and all kinds of military equipment. In fact, I snapped a photo of kids playing with a machine gun. Nothing is off limits here. One can pick up the machine guns and rifles, examine them, and have his photo taken with them. Everything there is very accessible.It's a great way to spend an hour or so, especially if you like military equipment."

We had a young boy who had a limb missing from stepping on a land mine give us a tour. He knew the names of all of the different types of land mines and did a fantastic job as tour guide. He then took us to an area where land mines were and we had to try and find them. It was very difficult. I hope that the museum becomes more recognized and that more people go through it in order to help them continue their work."

I would say unless you are really into this kind of thing to give it a miss. May be a good idea to see where the money goes as well before going or not. Still $3 person. On the way to the very worthwhile silk farm."

            "review": "Well worth it.. Great place. Only three bucks to get in and well worth it. It came with a free guided tour, though you have to give the guide a little tip. Our guide had been a soldier in the war and was missing a leg, had quite a few bullet holes in him, and some shrapnel was visible under his skin. He told us a bunch of first hand stories as we went from exhibit to exhibit which was quite educational and enlightening. We were given explanations of how every tank, gun, mine, etc worked and we were free to climb onto the equipment and hold the guns, though it was almost like holding something haunted. The best war museums I've been to in North America and even at the D-Day beaches in France still didn't have the impact this museum did, largely because the war just recently ended and you can still see the effects all around the country."
