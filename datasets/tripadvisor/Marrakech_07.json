Adil picked us up at the airport, went with us for two days to Essaouira and took us to see the Ourika Valley. Great person, reliable and always ready to help to solve some setbacks.If for any chance I return to Morocco, certainly I will hire his company services again."

            "review": "A great trip to see the highlights of morocco from Marrakech to Fes. We booked a tour to the Ouzoud Waterfalls with Moroccan Safaris. Adil picked us up from Jemma el-Fnaa square near our riad, and he was immediately very friendly. Our drive was smooth and fun, as Adil would play different traditional Moroccan and African music and explain their significance to us. He arranged for a local guide at Ouzoud to take us on a hike around the falls, and it was fantastic. We were able to get to places around the falls that larger tour groups couldn\u2019t. We got along so well with Adil and enjoyed our day trip to Ouzoud that we asked Adil if we could do a four-day desert trip from Marrakech to Fes. Adil immediately agreed and put together a great trip for us. On our first day of the road trip \u2013 which admittedly was a very long driving day \u2013 we stopped at so many interesting places: Ait Ben Haddou, Ouarzazate, and the Valley of Roses among them. In addition, any time we passed a particularly scenic overlook, Adil was happy to pull over and let us get out to take a picture. He booked us in an absolutely beautiful hotel with a gorgeous view in the Todra Gorge. The next two days of our trip were spent in Merzouga in the desert. They were truly amazing. We visited a Berber village, listened to an African music troupe, and took a private camel trek into the sand dunes where we spent the night at a beautiful campsite, eating great food and enjoying the stunning landscape and night sky. Adil was really flexible with our schedule along the way. At one point in the middle of our tour, we were deciding between switching our trip to three days and going to Chefchaouen or staying with our original plan and spending an extra day in the desert before making it to Fes. Adil was very kind to help us brainstorm our best options either way, and was happy to rearrange our trip if we wanted to. It really felt like a personalized trip. We decided to stay in the desert as planned, and enjoyed meeting a nomad family and getting extra time to hike through some sand dunes. On our final day, Adil arranged for us to take a mini-bus to Fes with some other travelers. What\u2019s really amazing is that, after our eight-hour trip with another driver, Adil called us to make sure we had arrived in Fes. Then he called our riad to see if someone would be able to meet us and walk with us through the confusing streets of the medina so we wouldn\u2019t get lost. (We had already begun walking and luckily found our riad!) Adil checked on us again, remembering our schedule, when we were arriving in Casablanca to make sure we got there safely and to see if we needed any help arranging a ride to the airport. He really went beyond the typical tour guide in this regard. He really cared about our comfort and experience in Morocco even after our tour with him ended, and he kept in contact with us and offered help whenever we needed it. Adil made sure we had the best time and saw as many wonderful sights in Morocco as possible."

Has his own 4 by 4 and provided a lot of the transportation I needed. Very enthusiastic about his country and his job. Showed me some really cool stuff and places. Even took me to his hometown for lunch with his family and friends!I guess one critic I would have is sometimes things get a little lost in translation as English is not Adil's first language. Speaks fluent French Spanish and of course Arabic though. Very impressive."

            "review": "Atlas Mountains and Airport Transfers. I have to Marrakech a couple of times this year. This time I was staying for a longer duration, but various different people were joining me, but going back-and-forth on flights at different points. When I needed an airport transfer and spoke about various excursions in Marrakech, I came into contact with Adil through recommendation. He contacted me via Whatsapp and then called me directly on my phone at a convenient time whilst I was in the UK. He did keenly send me all the prepared information on excursions and places of interest via Whatsapp. I had visited these places but didn't know some of the facts behind them so it made an interesting read.I mainly asked Adil for airport transfers, where one of the most reassuring things I felt even after my call was that he was always so responsive to any questions I messaged him with. You can appreciate 'responsiveness' can be really hit-and-miss with some transfer services. Adil checked all the necessary information about luggage, sent us his personal photo for identification, a photo of his jeep, and met us on arrival holding the name plate up as expected. As we agreed a set price (in dhs) all was clear with no issues. Change up some money at the airport to pay in dirhams. On arrival, when we got into his jeep and he immediately provided us with a WiFi password, he put on some amazing upbeat music en-route to our hotel, and all the group were clapping......we just knew with this type of greeting, we were about to have a great time in Marrakech! On the same night we checked-in to our hotel, we were out late and we wanted to buy some water (the hotel mini-bar was not an option). I has WiFi in the restaurant and whatsapp'd Adil on where I could get large bottles from. He was so helpful that he insisted on bringing the water bottles to us directly! 15 minutes later he pulled up in his jeep and waved at us on the open terrace where we were dining. A member of the group was unwell at dinner and he agreed to take her back to the hotel, along with the water, and as someone had to escort her to the room, he also bought the accompanying friend back to finish her meal as it was all within a 10 minute drive. Whilst of course we paid for the water and drive to/back to the hotel (only local prices) it was the small personal and helpful touches (service literally to our feet!) I think is something that you cannot forget with Adil, and it was great that he was free that night. Even when Adil was in the desert with excursions on several occasions, he was still able to respond to messages at occasional points and send from his network of drivers the airport transfers. He always provided us with the name of the driver and also a description of the car, they were always on time. We used his service 5 times for the airport during the trip.There were also Atlas Mountains excursions x 2 groups at different times. We knew how we wanted to plan each excursion, and while you can take on board suggestions from Adil, you do not have to follow the plan given. Tailor make what you want (take out the craft stop-offs if you wish) and fix your price. On one trip Adil drove us there, and the other time another of his drivers. Again on both occasions there was always fun en-route and plugging in our phones to play our music and the drivers were always clapping and laughing. We allowed 6 hours from hotel pick-up to return hotel drop-off (but we did not do any stop-offs). Upon reaching the Atlas mountains the easy entry point I found (tested 3 times!), was a small wooden slatted entrance bridge a few yards along from a dark blue painted restaurant (I have forgotten the name! but it sounded French) on the opposite side of the road.This restaurant is also the best place to confirm as a meeting point (if you do not have a moroccan sim phone) as when you are dropped off, the pick up time is roughly agreed. I think 2-3 hours for the mountains to reach the main waterfall is usually enough! This restaurant was also one of the few places that has western toilets that were relatively well maintained. We also ate the set menu (100dhs or 150dhs set menus) there in the upholstered seating area (which is by the stream) which you get to by using the small bridge opposite the main restaurant from the road/set-down area. You can just order a la carte.Along that small stretch, there are various places you can eat where there are all fairly standard offerings (set price 100dhs or 150dhs menus), but on another occasion we stopped at one of restaurants within the Atlas mountain levels, which had a decent European toilet and washroom facilities and just ordered tagines from standard menu to share and found it was enough. When returning from the Atlas mountains, I recommend driving directly (rather than doing any stop-offs) back, you will appreciate the resting time in the car, the scenic unhindered drive, with some relaxing music, which leaves you with enough energy for any evening you have planned. Once thing we found was Adil's name was very well-known! Especially to many road check-point staff and in restaurants.  Although I initially felt like Adil co-ordinates a large vehicles and excursions business, I found he was very personable and was always able to help on small matters! We had the idea to visit the Palmeraie, which on the face of it sounds like a theme park style area (but it is not!). I read some Tripadvisor reviews about the ease of going there and caught a taxi there. But it is a vast area, and unless you direct the taxi driver to somewhere very specific, you will be taken to a random location (with no WiFi) where it feels like it in the middle of nowhere, and because the taxi driver will have overcharged for the journey, and expect a kick-back from the one waiting guide, the taxi will be keen to wait for a return journey. After realising we were not exactly sure of where we were and how it really all worked, we could not see much around - but were luckily in a small cafe, I asked the cafe staff to phone Adil. He spoke to them and managed to locate us and I was pleased to see him! He explained how the quad-bike/camel riding trips worked and drove us to the area and explained all about the Palmeraie which seemed like 20 minutes away from where we were dropped off. As much as we appreciated the information, we were too hot and bothered and realised we did not change enough cash, and also wasted so much time by then, we decided not do the quad-biking. The reassurance of Adil picking us up helped changed our mood, and we did not waste the entire day, as we asked to be dropped off in Guilez the modern district with the shopping centre and Starbucks. Upon reflection, I feel the Palmeraie was something that should be booked as a planned excursion, but it is something that I have yet to experience.In Marrakech you will find people are generally receptive, but like all holidays you will determine the worth of your trip based cost, which often equals how enjoyable it was for you personally and how smoothly and hassle-free it runs (in a city where negotiation is key)."

            "review": "Somewhat fun, but impersonal tour. I must admit my expectations were probably a bit too high, seeing all the positive reviews made me sure this was THE company to book a tour with. Adil met up with us at our riad and we had a short discussion where we discussed the different tours he could offer. We finally decided to do the Ourika valley and the Essouira tour. He was helpful and professional and i got a really first good impression. One of the key sellings points of choosing the private tour was that we would be skipping all the \"tourist\"-stuff that tries to sell you something. However, as the tour started, we soon realized we were on a rather set program that everyone does. We were able to skip some of the rather obvious and uninteresting stops, such as the pottery making shop and some metal workshop, which was nice, but we weren't able to escape it completely as i had hoped. At the berber village we were sent into a argan oil \"factory\" and felt obligated to buy something in the end, at the herboriste in the end of the tour, again we were treated to a huge commercial show, and felt we had to purchase something. It was a bit disappointing, but it is not the reason i am giving this an average rating. One of my key goals with the tour was riding a camel, and after the berber village, we stopped at some camels that we could ride. However, it was absolutely heartbreaking. The camels seemed thin and unwell, and for some reason i had to ride on a mother camel with a child. I kindly asked Adil to tell the \"camel guy\" to give me a different camel, but i don't think he understood what i meant. Having the poor child camel being dragged by a short rope was uncomfortable to me and seemed very cruel to the camel. My girlfriends camel was tied hard to the read of my saddle, in a very unnatural position, and her camel seemed scared and stressed. The camel ride which was supposed to be a fun highlight of the tour turned into a heartbreaking display of animal cruelty. We continued on to the Ourika valley waterfall in silence. The waterfall was a very nice experience. We got a local guide, Jamal (sorry if that's spelled wrong), who was really cool to trek with, and the trip went up rather nice mountain terrain. Unfortunately, the tour program did not mention that there would be technical challenges to the mountain trek (climbing, skipping from stones, etc.) so my girlfriend had brought along completely wrong shoes, but it worked out fine. The next day we did the Essouira trip. After about an hour we stopped at the most touristy cafe in the world in a small town. And then continued. Here along the road, Adil wanted to show us how argan oil is produced. The way they're illustrating this is by literally lifting goats up into trees, and having them stand there all day for tourists to see. I was just speechless. Poor poor animals. Looked long and hard at the other argan trees on the route, but none had goats climbing in them. Once we arrived in Essouira we were taken to a super-touristy fish restaurant, it was below average food, but pricy of course. Exactly what we would have gotten on a group tour. The program then specified we would get a guide in the city, but we never saw this guide. Instead we got to wander by ourselves in the city, which was actually a really nice experience. It was the highlight of the day, since it was a very beautiful and calm city. Sat down at a local cafe and enjoyed some tea, and then departed back. All in all, the big highlights of the trip made it worth it. Essouira city and the Ourika valley waterfall was beautiful and interesting, but the camel ride and goats in trees-stuff was terrible. Adil was an ok tour friend, but he didn't explain a lot or talk about our questions. Simple straight answers, and safe touristy choices. We're perfectly ok about touristy stuff, but don't say you're going to do a tour that skips it when you're going to do a tour that doesn't skip it. Also, for some reason he never bothered to learn our names. He kept calling my girlfriend Aisha and me Alibaba. It all felt a little mechanic and unpersonal."

First of all, I am not really up for tours usually, as I only had a couple of days to get to know Atlas mountains and Ouarzate, I booked a trip with Adil, feeling a bit unsure about being guided somewhere.Adil was a great guide, friendly, welcoming and instructed, everything a guide should be.Apart from that, as a bonus, he was the kind of person that respects your space, talks when you feel like, enjoys silence when it's there to be enjoyed, and let's you customise your experience! We became friends.I'll come back for sure!Cheers!"

I've been staying in Morocco for 3 weeks and my experience has been ok before this tour because I've mostly been visiting touristy places. Taking a tour with Rachid made me absolutely fall in love with this country and all it has to offer. Not only was Rachid the best guide I've ever had - the mountains, desert and everything we saw was completely breath-taking. The restaurants we were taken to were the best I've had in all of Morocco. He was beyond accommodating - making sure we always had water, always went to the best places, and even made sure I always had a vegetarian meal option. And doing Morocco in the summer means you must have air conditioning!! Rachid's car was so comfortable and definitely an oasis from the heat. He was professional, kind, and by the end of the trip you start to feel like you are traveling with good friends. Even after the trip was over, Rachid was so helpful getting me to my hotel and making sure everything was ok. You can tell he really puts his heart into what he does as he is so passionate about showing us the real Morocco, not the one you will ever see going out on your own. If you come to Morocco and don't take this tour you will be missing out on so much. This tour is probably one of the top 3 travel experiences I've had in my life."

Adil was very helpful in his emails and was waiting at our hotel with a smile on his face at the agreed time. We did a day trip into Ourika valley and really got to see the real Morocco. A visit to a berber family, a trek through the atlas mountains, dinner by a river, a camel ride and a few other enjoyable stops. Having such a lovely talkative guide in Adil made the drive there very enjoyable. Absolutely lovely man who is perfect as a guide. We will be returning to Morocoo in a few years time, and the reason for that is to get a chance to go an a Sahara tour the next time with Adil. I already consider him a friend."

I spent a week in Marrakech with my wife and 3 children, Unfortunatly met Adil only one day before my flight back, he took us all in his comfy 7 seater 4x4 to Ourika/ sti Fadma , we started by visiting a barber house and having a lovely breakfast with morrocan tea, then headed to sti Fadma to climb the mountain and see the waterfalls, on the way he entertained the kids with nice interesting games, i was worried about my 5 yrs old clinmbing with me, we met Mohamed our moutain guide who was wonderful, he carried my heavy Rucksack and my little girl all the way up, we stopped for lots of pics , amazing views, that was followed by a wonderful 3 course meal on the river , on our way back we stopped for Camel riding which was awesome, the big surprise was the nice souvenirs that Adil gave us as a gift....couldn't thank him enough for such a lovely day, i am now arranging with him for my next trip"

This time I came with a couple of friends, who were coming to Morocco for the first time so I wanted them to appreciate the beauty of the country. From the moment I got in touch with Adil to the moment I left Marrakech, Adil and Rachid looked after us as if we were family and ensured that our stay was worry free. We decided to do a drive through the Tizi n Tichka Pass/ Atlas Mountains and then visit Ait Ben Haddou. It was sublime and we were in awe of the overpowering mountains. In fact, my friend on the journey said it was one of the most peaceful experiences for him and vastly different to the resort holidays he usually goes to. We had some amazing food on the way and were introduced to some interesting shops, with both Adil and Rachid ensuring that we paid local rates. Adil also provided a very comfortable people carrier, which meant we had enough room for the journey. I will be using Adil and Rachid again - I've heard they do an amazing desert trip, so will be trying that next year. Thanks Adil and Rachid - a wonderful trip with great people like yourselves."

Tell him the kind of experience you're looking for, and he'll make it happen. Looking for the best photos? He knows the places and the times of day. Looking for culture? He'll have you drinking tea in a tent in the desert one moment, and listening to music from from traditional Senegalese and Sudanese musicians the next. Looking for the best food? He knows the places, no matter what your budget. Want to avoid the tourists? Adil knows how. Want to see hidden sites the guidebooks don't mention? Adil knows where they are. His transportation is comfy, and off-road capable, with plenty of room for your gear, and he'll get you where you need to go. And the man can drive! With a breathtaking level of precision, he navigates roads and streets and alleyways that a normal driver would find impossibly daunting, but he's always willing to stop whenever you like to take a photo or even just stretch your legs. Adil himself is enthusiastic and wonderfully engaging and friendly. He also has a great sense of humor. You'll actually miss him when you go home. :)"

I originally reserved our trip to the Erg Chebbi dunes through a riad that booked it through another tour company which in turn passed our reservation on to Adil. Both myself and my husband couldn't have been happier to have had him as our guide to the desert.Adil showed up promptly at our riad in the morning and introduced himself, speaking impressively good English (as well as many other languages). His 4x4 was very comfortable and during our drive south he played many different types of Arabic language music for us, which we loved. He patiently answered all of our questions and went to much effort to ensure we had a wonderful time.Both of the hotels he booked us into were wonderful. Our room in Dades Gorge had a breathtaking view of the river and canyon and our hotel in Merzouga was right next to the dunes of Erg Chebbi, so we could wander out easily into the desert.Because Adil knew we were photographers, he made every effort to stop at beautiful places for us to photograph. We visited a large rock formation, a geyser on the side of the road, a restaurant serving Berber pizza, a group of African musicians, and many beautiful small villages with gorgeous architecture. Instead of taking us straight to the shops like some other tour guides did, he would always ask us first, \"Do you want to stop here?\" One night when we discovered some friends of ours were staying in Merzouga, he even stayed up late to take us to their kasbah and pick us up when we were finished meeting up. Once our tour had ended, Adil continued to check in with us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. He even picked us up from the bus station free of charge to take us to our riad during the next part of our trip and also drove us to the airport on our last day.Our trip with Adil is something we will remember and cherish forever. We both consider Adil to be not just someone who is pleasant to do business with, but a friend as well. I would wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone looking to do this trip and would definitely use his services again in the future. Thank you kindly Adil, for going above and beyond. Saha!"

The waterfalls were amazing and very refreshing after the heat of Marrakech! Adil provides a guide who will take you up to the waterfalls as it involves quite a bit of climbing. We ate our lunch afterwards in a restaurant where the tables are actually in the river, which was really fun and Adil joined us so we got to know him a bit better. This is a brilliant tour, Adil is unbelievably enthusiastic and will answer any question you have or help you do anything that you're interested in. There's a lot of choice in Marrakech so if you're looking for a great company, this is one!"

He spoke perfect English which allowed us to communicate with him easily. He was very friendly, helpful and very eager to attend to anything we might have wanted. Adil was very informative as well, he would give information on a particular location we may have been at the time. We travelled in a large four wheeled drive car that was very comfortable and clean which was certainly pleasant.We were picked up by our guide, Adil, from the airport and promptly taken to our riad where we were able to drop off our luggage before spending the day in Marrakech. Adil was there to guide us the entire day and was very helpful in helping us to see the highlights of the city during the day and the souks during the night.The following day we travelled through the Atlas mountains to Ouarzazate and eventually to Todra Gorge. We had plenty of opportunities to stop and take pictures. The mountains were breath taking and Todra Gorge was particularly stunning. We stayed the night at a hotel in Todra Gorge which was a small valley within the Atlas mountains. The hotel staff were very friendly, cheerful and welcoming.The next morning we set out for the Sahara desert and drove to a small town just on the edge before heading out on camel back to the campsite. We had set out in the evening so as not to feel the heat of the sun at midday. It was well into night by the time we had arrived at the campsite after having camel ridden for two hours. The scenery was something that cannot be forgotten. Riding through the desert on camel back with almost no other signs of life is an experience that was surreal. We had dinner at the campsite and admired the starry skies for the rest of the night until the next morning.We\u2019d woken up early the next day in order to climb a sand dune and witness a sunrise over a desert. We then left the Sahara before the midday heat started to affect us. Once we left the desert Adil driven us back to Marrakech which had taken most of the day.The following day we visited Essaouira, a fishing port on the western coast of Morocco. We spent time on its sandy beaches as well as walking through the city and fishing ports in order to see the main sights there. We later returned and spent the rest of the night at Marrakech before leaving for home the following morning.All in all it was a purely unforgettable experience. The sights that we had seen were beautiful and our guide, Adil was extremely helpful. We had a fantastic time in Morocco and this is a trip that we\u2019d all wholeheartedly recommend for anyone planning to visit the country! And off course we highly recommend Adil and his service. Adil raise the bar so much that you would forget you are in an unknown territory."

We had booked to stay in a riad in the centre of Marrakech so wanted to do a day trip into the Atlas Mountains and came across Moroccan Safaris on Trip Advisor - we ended up booking the Ourika Valley Day Trip. We were picked up by our guide Adil at 09:00 from our riad (noting that the riad is located about a 4 minute walk from the nearest car parking area through a maze of winding streets and alleys so it was so nice of him to come and collect us in person instead of meeting us at his car). Then we got into his 4x4 vehicle and set off on the drive. We stopped along the way to our destination in the Ourika Valley to take photos and Adil was very knowledgable and explained a lot about the history of Morocco. We stopped first at a local potter who showed us how they make their array of plates, bowls and tagines, then at a traditional Berber house for a tea ceremony and breakfast of bread, honey and olive oil, then to see how the women make Argan Oil and then finally at a local artists studio (a friend of Adil's) to see the sculptures that the artist makes. Adil was very clear that he was at our disposal and he encouraged us to ask him to stop at any time to take photos. When we arrived at our destination at the Ourika Valley Adil had arranged for a local guide to meet us and take us trekking up to the waterfalls. Luckily Adil had warned us to wear sensible walking shoes as the trekking was quite rocky and we saw a few people struggling in not-so-sensible shoes. On the way up the mountains we saw barbary monkeys and more craftsman selling rugs and other things. The waterfalls were incredible and it was a lovely cool break from the heat of Marrakech. After our trek we sat down at a restaurant on the river for a lovely lunch of tagine and couscous before Adil drove us back to our riad. We really can't recommend this tour enough - Adil was a wonderful guide and it was worth every penny. We hope to see him again and will be recommending him to friends and family :)"

Gotta be real: I didn't like the idea of taking a three-day private tour of the desert because, to me, I understood it as getting in a car with a stranger and being taken to the middle of the Sahara Desert...  But I did it and it was amazing! Adil picked us up from our Riad and took us on an amazing journey through the Atlas Mountains, gorges, and finally to the Sahara to ride camels to a campsite in the dunes where we were able to meet tons of other people. Actually, we were put in a camp with a group that came together and they were all very unhappy with their driver who was apparently \"mean\"; and they were upset that they didn't they had to pay to use the pool at the hotel nor were able to shower until their return to Marrakech 14 hours later- whereas we had a room to store our things, shower, and we didn't have to pay for the pool. The trip was safe and I never felt too isolated from people or places on the lonely roads that connect Marrakech to the Sahara. Adil organized tours, hotels, and meals to accomodate our trip. I'm under the impression that he works with a vast network of hoteliers and shop keepers- (assumably comprised of family and friends) with whom he is able to coordinate and which were all extremely friendly and accommodating! Adil took us to a rug maker in the mountains where we were able to get a Moroccan rug at a much better price than what we could have found in Marrakech. All in all it was an amazing trip and Adil is really able to work with you to make your trip memorable. If you're looking for a trusty excursion outside of the chaotic marketplace of Marrakech, then you should definitely look into this! Thanks Adil! Sorry about making you go out to the desert during Ramadan."

Our guide Adil picked us up at our hotel at exactly the time that we had arranged. Though Adil stated that English was not his 3rd language (as he speaks French, Arabic, Spanish, Italian), I honestly would have though he had learnt it formally.The drive to the mountains was aprox 1 hour and the 4x4 was comfortable and clean. Adil offered on several occasions to stop so that we could take photos. On one occasion I asked could we stop so that I could take a photo of a beautiful village on the spine of one of the mountains, while Adil was more than obliging he also informed us that we would receive attention from the locals who would want to sell us their products. This was helpful and considerate as sometimes this can be an intense experience.We were taken to a traditional Moroccan house where we met a lovely family who happily welcomed us into their home. Though the family were on Ramadan they still provided breakfast and tea for us. Both the woman who owned the house and Adil made us feel very at home and answered all of the questions that we had.After breakfast we were taken to a waterfall high in the Atlas Mountains. One small point I feel could have been empathised more strongly is that it is quite a trek (if you are not a particularly active person) to the waterfall, and so some may find it tough. Thankfully myself and my girlfriend are both quite fit and so had no issues. Adil left us in the hands of a local boy called Jamal who was as accommodating and friendly as Adil. At no point during this trek did we feel uncomfortable or rushed. Jamal's English was again superb and we found it very easy to communicate. The view from the waterfall is truly breathtaking, all the local tour guides were friendly and had a sense of humour. Jamal allowed myself and my girlfriend to spend as much time as we wanted by the waterfall and this even gave me a chance to go for a quick dip in the lagoon. Once we had descended we ate a lovely meal IN the river. The water is less than ankle high and is very refreshing given the 44+ degree heat.The entire day was absolutely perfect, and very reasonably priced (by European standards). While Adil was our guide (and a very good one at that) I feel by the time the day was out he was more like a friend. He is always helpful and obliging even in short notice. Adil even brought us to the airport on our departure day with less than 3 hours notice. He is truly a credit to the Moroccan people and to the company.I would highly reccommend this trip to anyone and everyone, and if it isnt clear by now Adil is your man."

Organisation was excellent from airport pick up to drop offs. 2. Hotel quality and desert trip chosen were well above expectation.3. Adil finds an excellent balance between entertaining the children ( magic stone bridges, hotels with swimming pools), off the beaten track experiences ( berber irrigation systems, mac adil construction site..) and great insights on more tourity attractions.Bottom lineif ever want to discover Morocco with your family, Adil ans moroccosafari should be your first call"

We met Mohamed, the director and owner of the Marrakech Travel Services, in his modest office and were instantly warmed to him and his team's attentive and professional approach to our travel requests. We wanted to make a day trip into the Atlas Mountains and Ourika valley but also requested to make a stopover at the famous Richard Branson owned hotel called Kasbah Tamadot to enjoy lunch whilst soaking up the amazing panoramic views of the mountains. This section of the trip was not part of their regular excursion route but Mohamed was happy to accommodate and assured us this would not be a problem. He said he would explain everything about the modified route to his driver ahead of the trip the next morning. My wife and I were picked up promptly the following day from our hotel by his courteous and professional driver & guide Abdellah. He had obviously spoken to Mohamed, as promised, as there was a clear understanding and no confusion of our intended itinerary at the outset. The minivan was air-conditioned, clean and comfortable which was important for the long day ahead. Abdellah, himself born and brought up as a Berber, kept us informed and entertained during our journey with his occasional amusing quips about the Berber taxis (mules) Berber Wembley stadium (a small sandy make-shift soccer pitch) and Berber McDonald's (a lone roadside meat vendor)!!Our visit into the Berber village, across the mountains and back to Marrakech was very smooth with occasional strategic stops for photographs. We returned with fond memories of life in the mountains. We felt confident and safe with our driver throughout the day and would have no hesitation in recommending Mohamed and his team at Marrakech Travel Services to our friends and family for future reservations. Thank you and hope to see you all again in Marrakech soon. Dr Sanjay Gupta"

We only paid 20 euros when other people who had booked it through another company had to pay a lot more. A lot of people who we were on the tour with were complaining because they were charged 80 euros. The waterfall is beautiful and we even had the opportunity to take photos with the monkeys and go on a bamboo raft boat so that we could get closer to the waterfall. Keep in mind though that the guide is not included and you have to pay 3 euros extra for him. Overall, I would definitely recommend this day trip if you want to experience something different to Marrakech and if you don't mind to hike."

We were sold the 3n2d over the 1 night trip because we were told you get to see more of the real desert. Whilst I can't really compare the two types of tour having only done one, I did feel disappointed that our camel ride was only 40 mins rather than the 1hr and a half - 2hrs as we'd been told. We didn't set off until almost sunset and left before sunrise which felt like not much time considering we spent nearly 2 days getting there!It seems that MTS provide the transport and the driver and the driver arranges the rest of the tour en route. I found the lunches overpriced and I would have liked to have learnt more about the desert and even the camels ! None the less, we saw lots on the way And got to sleep out under the stars. "

We noticed this group have really good reviews so we thought we'd try them out, rather than spending a fortune at our hotel for excursions. It was an easy 15 min walk from our hotel, sofitel, to find the marrakesh travel service office. You can also take a 5 min taxi drive to the office, which costs around 15/25d to get there. We met Abdullah and Ali there where we discussed some excursion options. They were really helpful and offered us three excursions at a very good price. All in all we payed 1,250d for the full day Atlas mountain trek, half day walking city tour with guide and the half day quad biking. where we chose to have one quad for us both and swapped half way because it worked out cheaper. Excluding the walking tour where we met the guide at the travel office, Ali or Abdullah would promptly pick us up from the hotel, along with the driver, at the time specified (they were always early). We had a fantastic time on all of the excursions, all of the guides and drivers made us feel comfortable, they are very trustworthy and they all have fluent knowledge of many languages, mostly European. If you want to go to the souks and the square without any hassle, we definitely recommend making use of the guide, our tour guide was called Mohammid, as they know the local language as well as people within the souks therefore yoy can geberally get the best price for whatever you want to buy.Overall, we would highly recommend, especially if you dont want to be ripped off for excursions by your hotel.

On our first day we actually went to the office in medina and booked this trip. We were greeted by friendly faces and we were looking forward to the trip ahead. I had researched this 3D2N tours extensively before coming and realized there are many companies which provide this tour. Some are quite cheap and some are quite expensive. This seemed to be a mid range option and with all the good reviews, it seemed like a easy choice. We were picked up right on time and taken to a minivan in the square. The minivan went a short distance to pickup other people and then the 3D2N people were asked to change vans. We thought this was a bit odd as our company agent dropped us to the first van.The new van was fine with AC and we had around 18 people which was pretty comfortable as it could seat 20. However as we started to chat with everyone, we realized that most of them were from hostels in Medina and had booked their tour directly from the hostels through various different tour companies and had paid the cheaper rate of about \u00a365-70 Euros. We soon began to realize that there is no difference between the cheaper and mid range option of these tours. It's seems like all the companies group the customers together when it's not so busy so there is no point in paying a premium. As such, our driver was very nice however, spoke little English and gave very little guidance about the plan of each day. Also, when we booked we were told that we would be making 5-6 stops along the way to see different sites. Of these, we actually only did three. However the three we did were really amazing which was the Ksar of Ait Ben haddou, the gorge and the visit to a berber family. We had local guides which was great. They did ask for tips but that's expected in morocco.The desert part of the tour was simply amazing and a great experience. The camel rides are only 1 hour each but that's more than enough time to appreciate the ride and enjoy the view. After 1 hr on the camels you will be happy to arrive trust me! The camp is quite basic but comfortable for one nights sleep. Don't expect to shower or feel clean however the food was great and the bathrooms were surprisingly clean. The Berber hosts were really great and made the night. The drive back is very long as per all the other reviews! But given how far you have to go, it's kind of expected. I didn't mind the traveling however I didn't appreciate the lunch stops along the way. We were taken to restaurants in the middle of nowhere even though we drove past several town centers along the way. Their prices ranged between 90-130 dirhams per meal. The food wasn't bad, however I didn't like how we were forced to eat here because we had no other choice. These places are made for tourists. But I think that's their plan. Overall, we really did enjoy the desert experience and would still recommend this tour, however we do feel slightly ripped off and cheated. Unfortunately I wouldn't book through this company again because you will be paying a premium for no reason. There are many other places to book for cheaper and you will all be grouped into the same tour."

The hotel had a pool and the dinner was served at the terrace during sunset. The camel riding and the night in the desert was fun, climbing the dunes in the sunset and playing drums with the local guides there. The last day back to Marrakech is a long drive, but its a long distance back. There is nothing to complain. I highly recommend to choose this agency, we liked this trip a lot!"

They warned the tour operator that I am intolerant to gluten and our tour guide also warned people responsible for food in hotel/camp. I recommend brining your own gluten free bread or rice cakes to the trip, for everything else it was taken care of. In restaurants for lunch you have plenty of options so GF lunch is not a problem.In case of a solo traveller or a single-sex couple travelling together, you might get another person in your room on the first night in hotel. So if you don't want to share, make sure that agency confirms private room (for me it was at no cost). For the second night you don't have much of a choice, you will (most probably) have to share the tent :)You can leave your stuff in the minivan, so I recommend taking an additional smaller backpack for repacking for the night in the desert.Don't expect too much of other than Sahara or A\u00eft Ben Haddou - you get to see these two pretty well; in other cities you only make a short stop or only drive through."

However, the agency should inform you about the real conditions. The first hotel was really basic, in fact we were really cold, see the pictures. People were nice, friendly, but I was expecting something better, specially because I know people that did the same trip with another agency and stayed in a hotel with more facilities. For the desert, we were told that we would stay in one tent alone, and we had to share it with other 2 couples. Please go prepared to a really basic structure. They also told us that the cost covered 3 hours of camel riding, 1:30 in the sunset and then 1:30 in the sunrise. In fact, it's just 30 minutes. I suppose 1:30 it's to much, but just did not liked that they did not gave us the right information. All in all, it was a good experience, specially because the group was really good!"

We were told that there would be a gentle 40 minute walk to see spectacular waterfalls. Suitable attired with tough walking boots, we scrambled over extremely rough rocky terrain for about 20 minutes at which point sadly I started to feel unwell (? Altitude sickness). We decided not to continue and returned to base alone. When the group returned from the waterfall, many of the participants who were considerably younger than us said they really struggled as the \"walk\" became extremely steep, rocky and hazardous. At the end of the tour, the guide was very blatant in his request and expectation of a tip. As Europeans we found this very embarrassing. I it was however an interesting tour and good value for money. Stout walking shoes or boots essential."

You could do it with your own rented car but might feel somewhat lost along the way and it is quite nice to have a (already paid) guide and dinner waiting for you.Winter is a good time to visit: Less tourists and less heat, but do bring a jacket and scarf for the evenings and dessert night."

Even before arriving in Morocco I already had a good impression about marrakesh travel services. I emailed back and forth with Mr. Abdellah who answered every single one of my questions. He gave me all the details and confirmations I needed and was always very quick to reply back. I hoped that this same type of good service and attentiveness would be apparent on the tour itself. I must say I was definitely not disappointed! Mr Ali, who is one of the main organizers of the trip, arranged a pickup for me from the airport. Not only that but he also walked me all the way to the doorstep of my hotel. As a first time solo traveler who was anxious and a bit uncertain it was nice to have someone who was willing to lead the way which made me feel much more at ease. He was very nice and welcoming.The next day was the pickup to start the drive towards the Dades gorges. I had booked a 3 day trip to the desert. Along the way there were stops to take pictures of the many beautiful landscapes that were truly amazing. The tour of Ait Benhaddou was very informative and interesting. It was a filming location for movies/shows like gladiator, the mummy and game of thrones which was cool. The hotel we stayed at was nice and we were served a delicious meal that night which was a great way to end the day. The next day we visited a berber village and were invited into their home to drink tea and see how the intricate carpets are made by hand. Later that day we arrived at the much anticipated location, the sahara desert! We hopped on our camels and made our way through the dunes and enjoyed a beautiful sunset. Later on we arrived at our camping site where we enjoyed some delicious food and sat by the campfire. The next morning we hopped back on our camels to our transportation and drove back to the city of Marrakech. The driver of the tourbus was good at safely maneuvering around the winding roads along the mountains. He also spoke four different languages which meant he could communicate with everyone in our group!I definitely would recommend this trip. I had a wonderful time and memories that will last me a lifetime. You definitely will not be dissapointed!"

He was rude to me and my wife in front of all the passengers when I brought orange juice into the minibus, saying \"this is not a hotel or a restaurant\". Also when we stopped for a bathroom break and we didn't want to come out to use the bathroom, he insisted we all leave the minibus and locked the doors, leaving us outside waiting for about 10-15 minutes while he disappeared. He also made some remarks about us being from a particular South Asian country in what we perceived to be in a derogatory manner, even though we aren't even from that country and he'd never asked us where we were from - not appreciated!Nevertheless, the company itself, especially the agent Ali who we used, were very nice and I'd recommend the company."

The highlight of the tour was the hike to the cascades. It was a difficult hike for me, but many of the views are simply stunning. You will feel a great sense of achievement once the bottom of the cascades is reached. Further along, when you get to the cafe at the top, try their tea, it is very delicious; take time to enjoy it and look down into the cascades and the pool below.

We were then free to do what we wanted at the town & got driven back later. Extremely reasonably priced, very happy!"

            "review": "Good price, excellent service. We're a family of 6, with 2 small kids (11 and 9 y.o.) and we came to Marrakech without a plan. First we went on a tour with some other company, but we didn't feel safe, because the driver was most of the time on a phone, even writting and reading during driving a very narrow road. Also a car was in bad condition.So we looked for another company and we were very lucky to find Marrakesh Travel Services with its manager Mohamed. He tried to do his best to pleasure us. He gave us his probably best driver Mohamed, who was not only a driver, but also a very good (personal) guide. Also we got a very good car. Usually you have to pay for a guide with personal guide around 100 EUR/person, but a cost of a trip is much lower when you take just a driver. But as I mentioned our driver Mohamed was better guide than a professional (official) we took for a city tour in Marrakech. We took 2 trips: first to Essaouira, a beautiful city on a cost. The cost was 25 EUR/person for a whole day trip. Second day we took a trip to Ouarzazate with a highlight of a trip, a special place called Ksar of Ait-Ben-Haddou. But before you come to this place it takes a very, very long (4 hours on way) adventurous drive over Atlas Mountains, but is definitely worth it. This whole trip cost us 30 EUR/person. Children payed half price. Despite a dangerous road we felt very safe in hands of our friend Mohamed.We would definitely recommend this company since you get almost a personal tour for the price of ride only. And with that, they give you 1.000 smiles."

We took a long drive through the Atlas mountains and stopped at a few shops along the way and had a delicious lunch! When we arrived in the Sahara desert, our camels were waiting for us and we rode them about an hour to the camp site. The camp site far exceeded our expectations. Groups of four shared a spacious tent with beds and they even had electrical plugs in them. Once we settled in, we listened to live moroccan music and ate traditional tagine. The musicians performed and danced for us all night, I will never forget this amazing experience. Our tour guide \"brother raad\" was extremely accomodating and he even invited us to a surprise dinner with his boss after we returned to Marrakesh. I would highly recommend this trip and it was well worth the money. - Carly (Semester at Sea)"

I had to prepare a big bundel of fruit for my self because the restaurant sell carbo and meat and less vegetable. I need more. Drink much water is very recommended eventhough you are not thirsty.In the afternoon, we arrived in Sahara. We were riding one hump camel about 1h to the tend where we stay. For experience, it was a bit hard but excited. There is a bathroom and toilet for man and woman, each. Dinner was good. The music was good and special. I got single bed in the tend; Breakfast was berber breakfast with coffee and tea and milk, bread and butter, cheese, and jam;For the whole, the tour was perfect for me."

We started with the mosque and the general history of the city. Later on, he showed us a residential quarter, where many locals live. He explained the differences between Riads and Dars and why the city is built the way it is. The last part of our tour was inside the Souks, assisting us with our first haggling experiences and giving us advice and guidance on how to find our way back to the main square. He also helped me to locate an authentic natural henna tattooist as I have a very severe allergy to the black henna. There is so much more that we haven't mentioned here, but we will leave that for you to experience for yourself. We definitely recommend Abdul!!"

He took me through the souks and showed the artisans who manufactured the goods where there was no pressure to buy. He took me to see a man who stokes the fires for the hamans who played a unique musical instrument and also sang. I was taken to have lunch at a quiet place. I could not access the ATM that caused me to quietly panic but Abdul helped me to persevere until successful. The day ended with a visit to the Majorelle Gardens where I could relax after the day's activities. It was very hot and Abdul was patient with my need to stop and have a cold drink.Abdul demonstrated great integrity though out the day and I could not recommend him more highly."

And I have to say, we weren't let down. He lived up to every review. He met us at our hotel, which was a 10 mins walk out of the medina bang on time. We then took a slow walk in to the medina with him explaining the layout of the city and the area we were in as we went. We then spent the next few hours (we finished at 4.15) walking around the medina with him explaining many interesting bits. We stopped for a drink in a lovely riad, he left us for lunch in his favourite snack bar (whilst he went to the mosque), showed us the school he'd been to, the bakery (the baker has been there for 50 years), the hammam, and took us on a winding walk through the bits of the medina where you can still see the items being made by the craftsmen. We'd have been very lost without him.At the end of our tour he helped us get a taxi home (we were very hot, sweaty and dehydrated by then) and when the taxi driver wasn't sure where he was going Abdul came back with us then went home himself.At no point did he take us to his 'favourite' stalls. He was happy to give advice along the way - we subsequently went back and tried some of the bars and restaurants, which all lived up to his comments - and just gave us a good flavour of the medina. The reviews are justified. We felt like we'd seen some good things, learned a lot and got a few good photos along the way. We'd absolutely recommend this tour.Warning: it is a walking tour so take plenty of water (although you'll be able to buy along the way), wear a hat and comfy shoes and grab shade where you can."

We were a group of 8 and usually I think Youssef would suggest a smaller group; afterwards I can see why! I would say may be up to 4 is ideal and everyone should be fully engaged unlike our group as there is so much to see and so much history. Youssefs representatives Hassan and Noura were excellent however; patient and knowledgeable. We had to split our time into two 3 hour tours as we could not complete everything in one day due to the size of our group. Thankfully Youssef was able to arrange for Noura to come on the second day at short notice. Youssef has always been pleasant and cooperative. All our communication was by email prior to leaving the UK. We paid after the tour.In away we were fortunate to have split the tour between Hassan and Noura. Hassan is from a Berber background and had a lot of knowledge about his people. At the end of the tour he took us to a rooftop berber restaurant which served us totally top drawer food. Likewise Noura was from a Arab background and was able to give us a different perspective on things. She also took us to a great restaurant in the Medina which would have never found by ourselves. Both tours were great and worked out well for our group. Everone was happy with the experience which is difficult to achieve.

Abdul is very informative and was happy to answer our many questions. He also pointed out many of the famous buildings of the city such the big towers and hotels . Along the way he gave us many of the local secrets on how to navigate the medina which we found very useful. Abdul told us his favorite stalls in the markets (stall #14 and #98), where the best views are, where to get fresh orange juice, how to get to the main square from a certain point and much more. The snack breaks and the lunch spot were overall pretty good. A plus is that he gives you privacy to dine with your own family during lunch. Abdul was also happy to take pictures of the family and he took us to some of the best photo spots in Medina. Another plus about Abdul is that he is great with kids and accommodating their needs. Abdul made it fun with lots of interesting facts and places to look forward to. He was very patient and was very flexible when one kid was tired. Abdul also brought us to all the shops we wanted: dried fruit and nut, slipper store, jewelry etc., and most importantly he saved time and effort (and stress) but negotiating the price for us. We never felt any pressure to shop or buy. The day went by very quickly and all four of us, including the kids, enjoyed the tour very much. We highly recommend Abdul and Morocco Guided tours!!"

Again Abdul fills you in with lots of information about where you are. My wife and I couldn't have asked for anyone better to be our guide and we would highly recommend Abdul."

I had read many reviews about Abdul, one of the Tour guides prior to going to Marrakech and was fortunate enough to have been able to book 2 half days. We were interested not only places to see and shopping , but an understanding of Moroccan history and culture . I learned lots, not just facts and figures, but a glimpse at life, in a culture steeped deep in history, beauty , family and spiritual life.I learned lots about the craftsmanship and what to look for in the different things I was shopping for. Abdul's tips and teaching was helpful as my husband and I navigated the souks later on in the week on our own. He will also provide suggestions for a variety of other activities such as cooking schools, and massages. In addition to a walk within the medinas souks, and historical places, we were taken into one of the residential area homes (now a gallery) in the medina which was away from the busyness of the market.It was a wonderful walking tour at a pace that provided ample time for conversation as we explored. If you want to get Abdul as a guide, book ahead of time because he is in demand and you will understand why if you are fortunate enough to get himThanks Abdul. we will treasure the memories of this trip, one of the best I have ever taken.Alice"

This trip with Abdul is not to be missed. He is incredibly informative and answered all of our questions, ranging from cooking to history. We were picked up from our Riad, bang on time, and escorted to the lovely air conditioned car. Our driver for the day was brilliant, we felt very safe with his driving skills. Our first stop was a local market, we had a walk round with Abdul, very interesting to see a market for the locals selling the wares. This is not for the squeamish or vegetarians. It gives you a real insight into life here and we would not have missed it. Then onwards through beautiful countryside, Abdul gives you information all the time. He is extremely amusing with a great sense of humour. We then opted for the shorter walk through the villages, this also is a must, the people are so friendly. If you do this be sure to take writing books, pens etc for the village children. We were impressed with Abdul he had a list of names of some of the children and their ages and their particular requests. Very thoughtful man. We then had lunch with a Berber family and a tea ceremony. Delicious and fun. Then continued on with our walk, wear good shoes. On our way back we passed Richard Bransons hotel Kasbah. As my friend had got engaged there the week before Abdul arranged for us to have a little tour. When I have saved up I am definitely going there for a visit! To sum up, this tour was both informative and amusing. I can not rate Abdul highly enough, we were a bit nervous being on the slightly older side but we need not have worried. Abdul will adapt the tour to suit you. We felt we had a real insight into life in the Berber villages."

He took us on a knowledgeable journey around some of the most popular sites of the city and also to some more bespoke stops such as a bakery and a school. We also had no problem negotiating the streets with our push chair. We ended in the souks where I put my haggling skills to the test.Another day we were picked up from our hotel and taken up the Atlas Mountain. Again Abdul displayed brilliant knowledge and answered any questions we had, the photo opportunities were brilliant too. We met the local Berber village kids and handed out cookies to them. I would recommended bringing some colouring books and the like to hand out to the kids.We stopped off for lunch at a local Berber home and I was shown how to make Moroccan tea. The view was utterly stunning. Thanks Abdul we hope to see you again one day. 10 out of 10."

One little twist was how he guided us away from our riad and out into the city making a point to tell us how we should find our way back to the riad since he would be leaving us in the main marketplace (I'm not sure what it's called). At first, this made me nervous but it later proved to be very helpful information that helped us traverse the city on our own after the tour.Abdul is a great guide.

Abdul responded promptly and based on the information I gave him about our family, our likes, and interests, he recommended the Hidden Sides and Souks and High Atlas Mountains tours. We enjoyed both immensely! Abdul met us at our riad promptly, and I could immediately tell from his calm but enthusiastic demeanor that we were going to have an enjoyable two days! Abdul expertly explained history, culture, religion, and the beauty of his country. He is a patient man as we asked a million questions! Starting with the obvious we quickly delved into the hidden gems of Marrakech. I'm not going to give away Abdul's secrets, but he took us to places we'd never find on our own. Such neat experiences that I will always remember and cherish. I had told Abdul that I loved all the carpets in our riad and asked if I could buy any in the souks. He looked at a picture of my favorite carpet from our riad and told me he could take me to the store that sold the riad all their carpets. I purchased two carpets and will always remember fondly the experience of learning about and purchasing these treasures every time I look at them in my home. I purchased some other treasures in the souks. I appreciated Abdul's advice. He never told me what to do or not to do, but made subtle suggestions. There was never any pressure to buy from any merchant he introduced me to, but I quickly discovered he introduced me to the merchants with the highest and best quality goods. I also appreciated that he asked us what we were interested in seeing. For example, I didn't have any interest in spices or argan oil, so we skipped that all together. This was our tour based on our interests. I didn't have a lot of information about what we were doing on our second day of touring. However, I learned that Abdul was great at reading people. He figured out our likes and interests pretty quickly, and I trusted that whatever he had planned for us was going to be memorable. Again, I don't want to spoil his secrets, but I will always remember riding camels, trekking in the Atlas Mountains, and learning how to make mint green tea (including the proper way to pour it) in the home of a local family that shared lunch with us. Thank you, Abdul, for memories that I will cherish for my lifetime.I appreciated that Abdul encouraged us to bring pencils, pens, notebooks or trinkets to give to the kids that we would meet along the trail hiking. We brought a bag of pencils and bought some hard candies in the first village along the trail. I loved watching my daughter give pencils and candies to the children. I also loved the smiles on their faces! I can't thank Abdul enough for making his city come to life for us and for sharing it with us! I have had many private guides show me their cities, but Abdul is one of the best we've ever had the pleasure of meeting!"

I really fought to book with Abdul, as so many people were trying to secure him as their guide, and I am very glad that I was successful. Because you have one-on-one time with Abdul, you do not get lost in a group and really get to know and understand the city as a result. We did the Marrakesh city/souk tour one day and a day trip to Essaouria another. I would highly recommend both! Abdul helped us navigate the labyrinth that is the souk and took me right to the stalls I needed. He even haggled for me which was was wonderful and saved me stress of having to do so myself. The products that I walked away with were good quality and I didn't have to be fearful of falling for the for the other kind. Abdul went out of his way for us so many times during our stay. He took us to a phone repair shop and waited for a while after my husband's phone fell and the screen went black. He also offered us things of his own in case we didn't get the chance to buy them in the market. Only family does that and that is exactly how we felt. Abdul, we'd love to return the favor one day, so if you are ever in Boston, please look us up!"

We found Abdul, and we are so glad we did. Abdul met us on our very first day and took us on a tour of the Medina. Abdul asked our interests and adapted the tour to suit our party. Abdul is incredibly knowledgeable and gave us a fantastic insight into the history, architecture and culture of Marrakech. Whilst my sister and I loved shopping in the souks (and Abdul gave us some tips how to behave!) it was great to see the locals at work behind the scenes and their general way of life. Most of all Abdul made us feel safe, in what may seem a little daunting in such a busy city if you were on your own, pointing out landmarks and best paths back to our Riad should we get lost. It was the perfect start to our holiday and we happily ventured out confidently on our own the next day. We booked Abdul again for our last day and took a light trek up the Atlas Mountains. What a diverse delight! The views were incredible. Abdul took us to a Berber village where we learnt to make mint tea, had a huge tasty lunch and whiled away the afternoon soaking up the fresh air, sunshine and amazing views. It was the perfect end to a great few days. We loved Marrakech and made all the more enjoyable by such a diverse itinerary and all thanks to Abdul. Doing research really paid off if you're on a short trip and you want to make the most of it. I would absolutely recommended Abdul."

            "review": "Fantastic Tour Guide of the High Atlas Mountains!!!. We were a group of 7 students visiting Marrakech for 3d, and wanted to do something outside of the city for a day. I had read about Abdul's tours on another blog, and came upon his tripadvisor website which had raving reviews. A private tour of the High Atlas Mountains for the 7 of us including transport and everything came out to be very reasonable, price-wise! He knew so much about the city of Marrakech and answered all of the questions we had about the country as well. We were very impressed!We embarked on a light trek along the High Atlas Mountains (total took about 1-2h), and stopped at one of the local hotels to have tea with a great view of the mountains. We then continued on and had a traditional berber village lunch up on the mountain with a phenomenal view. Overall, this experience was an incredible day-long trip and I would highly recommend it to anyone! Especially for those who are looking to do something outside of the main city (even if you want to tour places around the city, I'm sure it would be great!), this is a fantastic tour experience!!"

He met us at our hotel, and we plunged head first into some of the more fascinating points about the history of the city. Our tour of the Medina was thoughtfully planned -- we entered by means of a small back street and not through a main artery. We visited a variety of sites, both old and new. He provided some fascinating context about the \"urban planning\" and organization of the Medina. We visited several merchants, both small and large. A late lunch at a street side vendor (apparently a friend of Abdul's) was on par with a dinner at a luxury hotel featuring a Michelin-rated chef. And we ended the day with an absolutely stunning stroll through the main plaza, the Jemma El Fnaa, where stalls, spices, snake handlers, locals, and tourists were all bathed in the gorgeous light of the setting sun. It was a really magical way to end the day. Highly recommended."

            "review": "The Only Guide We Had in Morocco That Was Totally There for Us. We hired Abdul for a day trip of hidden sides and souks of Marrakech. We tried to get him for an additional day, but he was unavailable. He is extremely knowledgeable about history and religion and tactful, but honest, in discussing Muslim interactions with the west. I was particularly touched when he described his own feelings about the day Baghdad fell, as a Muslim, even though he was no fan of Saddam Hussein. A big reason for travel is to have your horizons expanded and your views challenged and stretched. Abdul was marvelous for that. Abdul was also the only guide we had in Morocco that did not direct us to a tourist trap restaurant and the only guide that joined us in eating lunch. As a result, we had our favorite meal in Morocco with him. We mentioned that we were adventurous eaters and would like to try something unusual. He asked us if we would like to try sheep's head? We said yes and he took us to an alley off the main square where they cook sheep and showed us the pit they are roasted in, tangia pots where another type of cooking takes place, and also where the sheep heads are cooked. We then had a meal that involved beef cooked in tangia pots, roasted lamb from the pit and sheep's head. It was fantastic. I really felt Abdul was there for us and did not have a side agenda to direct us into various stalls and restaurants where he would earn an extra commission, something that we experienced with every other guide we had in Morocco. In fact, he stayed with us longer than we had contracted with him for, as there were some things he wanted us to see. I recommend Abdul without reservation and wish we could have had an extra day with him."

Abdul is a terrific guide, he has great knowledge, is passionate about his own time and is a really relaxed guide. Was perfect for a day of adventure away from the city.We were picked up at our hotel in a private van and taken towards the mountains - we sipped several times to take panoramic photos and Abdul filled us with knowledge on the area. We took the tour on a Saturday and we're lucky about to be able to stop at a weekly market in a town on the foot hills of the mountain - an experience to say the least!We carried on into the mountains and visited one of the famous Kasbahs which was really cool. After we had a gentle trek to a Berber village where we stopped to enjoy lunch with a local Berber family - a true experience to be hosted in a local family home and dine on some exceptional food. Abdul is a very considerate guide, making sure to give us a great experience while also being very sensitive to the local Berber people (he brought gifts with him which we have to children we met along our trek!)After a long and leisurely lunch we made our way back towards Marrakech, with Abdul keeping us entertained with his throws of the area and pointing out all the sights along the way.All in this was an exceptional day, we loved it and would put us at the top of a 'must do' list for anyone visiting the area. Thanks Abdul! The photos are on the way :-)Derek"

I visited Marrakech for work and wanted to make the most of my limited time, so based on his reviews, I booked a tour with Abdul before I arrived. I'm very glad I did. I wanted an English speaking guide and Abdul's vocabulary is better than many native speakers. He is very intelligent, thoughtful and respectful, and will arrange a tour to suit different interests. I was on my own and found his company very enjoyable. As we wandered through the souks Abdul pointed out landmarks so that I could find my way around alone, and at no stage was there any pressure to visit a friend's shop. He also shared his knowledge of the history and local customs of the area, and showed me interesting things I would have missed on my own (a school and a bakery etc). I paid more for my tour than some colleagues who found a guide themselves but they did not enjoy their tour as much as I did. When I went back to the medina later, I was able to tell them things that their guide had not told them, and find our way back in the souks because of the landmarks Abdul had noted. Sometimes you really do get what you pay for. I can't speak highly enough of him. Abdul, I wish you well, my friend."

We were welcomed by a tea ceremony and had a delicious meal at this Berber home .We tasted both restaurant food & the street food in the following days but nothing like the Berber home cooked one.

Abdul knew how short of time we were and so he even arranged that a seller of nice antique teapots met us on our way back to our Riad with 5 teapots to choose from. Truly unforgettable was the trip to Atlas mountains, where Abdul arranged donkeys for our kids to take them up the hill to the Berber home, where we had the best meal of our stay, true Morrocan food which we could enjoy from the terrace having view of beautiful valley and high mountains. Abdul together with the Berber host arranged a typical local dress for our dauhters and had them experience preparation of tea in Morrocan way dressed as Morrocan ladies. It was really a perfect day!!!!."

He is such a lovely man, we were quite a large group but he immediately made everyone feel at ease. He is also very knowledable and passionate about Marrakesh and you feel he knows so much about the City he would be able to tailor his tour to whatever you are interested in. He was also funny and made us laugh, telling my mum she was the queen which made us all laugh. He was also brilliant in the souks - took us to some genuine artisans and even bartered for us to get us some amazing quality goods for great prices, this really helped us as the enormity of the souks is quite overwhelming and we would have had no idea where to start without him. There was also some really nice touches - he bought lovely hot bread, chick peas with cumin and even gave us a bottle of his special olive oil which had been freshly pressed and he didn't even ask for any money for this - really beyond what you would get on a standard tour. You can't fail by booking a tour with Abdul and you will miss out if you don't."

I think if he'd been Japanese, he would have committed Harry Kari, unlike me, he could probably spell the phrase! Great guide as he knows his stuff. Good English. Introduced us to some of the tricks of haggling and explained life of people living and working in the medina. Would use again."

Abdul was very informative, had a lovely manner and spoke perfect English. All of our party had a great time and we would not hesitate recommending any of his tours.

As long as you are in a centrally located Riad he will meet you at your door on your first day this will save you a lot of heartache navigating. He also took the time to show us the way back too!Abdul showed us places and helped us meet people we never would have otherwise... I got some great photos thanks to him!Essaouira was well worth seeing too - Its so laid back and a perfect escape and foil to Marrakechs madness.Why are you still reading this?

Abdul was the perfect first impression of Morocco and the country's wonderful people. He caters the tour towards your personal interests so there is a lot of room for flexibility, which we really enjoyed and appreciated. He was patient, answered all our questions, told wonderful and interesting stories and took us to the best spots for mint tea, shopping and sightseeings. We later took a tour in Fez and it just wasn't the same. The guide took us to all the touristy spots and it was so disappointing and made us realize how special our guide and time in Marrakech was. Abdul really is an insider in the city - he grew up in the Medina so knows everyone from the baker to the hammam furnace man. All of who we got to meet :). Abdul was also kind enough to help us figure out how to ship a lantern home to the US. He is just so kind and goes above and beyond for his guests."

Before my arrival in Marrakech he was highly responsive and polite over email, asking what I wanted to see in the city so he could customize our tour. From the moment he picked my friend and me up at our hotel, he was absolutely charming and a veritable fountain of knowledge about the city. His pride in Marrakech is palpable and contagious, and we learned so much from him about this fascinating, friendly, unique place. Besides his boundless knowledge about the city's history and character, Abdul is also the ultimate guide if you're a shopper, as my friend and I are. Abdul took us to the wholesalers in the souks and helped us find literally the best of everything, from argan oil to light fixtures to handmade leather poufs. He also took us to a shoemaker who's well over 90 years old and has been making the best handmade slippers in the city for decades, as well as a tailor who makes exquisite linen clothing that you won't find anywhere else. Abdul helped us negotiate prices everywhere we went and, always the consummate gentleman, even insisted on carrying our bags.Having had such a wonderful day with him on Saturday, we hired Abdul again on Sunday for a late-afternoon trip to Jemaa el Fna (the city's sprawling main square) to watch the famous sunset. He took us to his favorite spice shop so we could buy saffron and then for tea at a spot with a lovely rooftop terrace before he took us to the best vantage point from which to watch the sun go down. When he walked us back to our hotel we were sad to say goodbye to him after he gave us such an amazing insider's view of Marrakech.As a travel writer, I constantly travel all over the world and have met many guides, and Abdul is the absolute best you will find. There is a no question he can't answer, and more importantly, he is an absolutely lovely man who goes out of his way to show and teach you everything he can about the city that he so clearly loves. I consider him a true friend and cannot wait to explore Marrakech again with him when I'm lucky enough to return."

He'll ask you questions on what you'd like to see and get a feel for your interests.We felt safe in his care at all times.

            "review": "Amazing tours that will show you the real Morocco. My husband, 16-year-old daughter, and I made our first visit to Morocco, and Africa for that matter, in November. We engaged Abdul and Marrakech Guide Day tours for three days - the full-day tour of the medina, the High Atlas Mountains tour, and the tour of Essaouira. I wish I could give Abdul 10 stars instead of 5, as his guidance these three days has shown us a part of Morocco we would have never found on our own.The tour of the medina was essential for getting us oriented to this maze-like city. Abdul explained how the addresses within the medina work and gave us detailed and helpfully repetitive tips such that we would be able to find our way back to our riad when we ventured out on our own. You will see so many sites on this tour that you would never find on your own. For example, we visited a baker in his traditional bakery and a man who stokes the fire for a hammam. Abdul grew up in the city, so there were constantly people greeting him and shaking his had, which was really special. One of the things that caught my eye on their website is the information about responsible tourism. While in the city, Abdul took us to visit a co-op of disabled women who make beautiful linens and crafts. Most guides don't go there, as there is not a commission for the guide. Abdul helped us barter when we wanted to shop, but only took us to places we wanted to see. The tours were totally planned around our interests.I can't stress enough how the tour of Marrakech shaped our vacation. The city is maze-like and a little intimidating for this South Carolina girl due to the language barrier. Having Abdul guide us allowed us to see more than we would have ever seen, without fumbling around for the map. Again, we packed in more sites in one day than we would have found in a week on our own.Next we took the High Atlas Mountains tour. We chose to have lunch with a local Berber family, which was incredible. They were such lovely hosts, and Abdul taught our daughter how to make the traditional tea service. The highlight of the trip for me was greeting the local children and giving them small gifts like pencils and pens. They were absolutely precious. The views in the mountains are stunning, and you feel like you are a million miles away from the city. It was super relaxing after the exciting hustle and bustle of Marrakech.Our final trip was to the fishing village of Essaouira. This is a beautiful coastal fishing town. We toured the buildings and saw incredible sea views. Abdul gave us the option of eating in a restaurant OR having our driver go to a seafood market and buying fresh seafood, which would then be prepared especially for us. We chose that option, and it was an amazing meal. I dream about the shrimp dish -- it was sooooo good! At the end of the day, Abdul treated us to a drink at a beautiful seaside cafe, which really touched us. He was such a pleasant person to spend three days with!!I cannot say enough good things about this tour company or about Abdul. He was truly our guide in all matters. He showed us the sites and was our navigator, but also helped us with any questions we had about what was considered polite behavior vs. \"no-nos\" in his culture, which was something that was extremely important to me. I left with an amazingly positive view of the Moroccan people, and I wanted them to think we'll of us, too. The communication prior to our visit was excellent, and Abdul completely arranges the trip based on your needs. Since we had him for three days, he got to know us and knew we always wanted the most traditional experience, not McDonalds or the mall (both of which they have in Marrakech, if that is your preference!). For example, my hubbie has a short window of time between bathroom breaks, and Abdul always made sure that we had a clean restroom throughout the day. This may seem like a little thing, but it is a major problem if you are uncomfortable on a vacation.Again, my highest, highest recommendation to Abdul and his company. He \"made\" our trip to Morocco!"

We booked Abdul for a 3 hour hidden sides and souks tour after reading other reviews and we were not disappointed.We started off exploring the back alleys and learning how people lived and history of the city.Abdul never made the tour feel rushed and took into account what we had asked to see and do.Inside the souks we managed to get what we required.Whether we could have achieved this with such ease if we had been on our own was debateable.Having Abdul as a guide gave us the confidence to return on our own another 2 times and to have had an insight into where we were going really helped,although we still got lost it was all part of the fun and we found new areas to explore.Abdul generously offered to meet us if he was free the next day,to help us if we needed it and we did email him.He replied quickly but unfortunately had a last minute booking.I would recommend him as a guide as he is very knowledgeable and is patient and willing to accommodate your requests.I would book with him again should we return."

I personally live in Morocco, and I booked both tours for when my parents came to visit. We wanted a hassle-free and relaxing trip to this beautiful port city. Abdul is a wonderful guide whose first concern is the comforts of his guests, and is a great person to talk to. The first time I visited in April of 2015, the weather was beautiful and we had a relaxing stroll through the city. Abdul gave us interesting historical information about Essaouira, and took us to some local artisanal shops. When I visited in October of 2015 it was absolutely torrentially raining, but we still had a great time. Abdul made us feel comfortable and took care of everything that was needed to make this day trip a great experience. He also took us to a small local restaurant where we had fish for lunch, and my dad said it was the best food he had in a week in Morocco. Highly recommended!"

We took the High Atlas trip, which included a short hike through Berber towns and culminated in a fantastic meal at a Berber house. Our guide Abdul was great. Even during the hour ride up to the mountains he talked to us about Moroccan and Berber history and what we would be doing for that day. We also had lots of time to discuss contemporary Morocco and Islam. Abdul was candid and honest and demystified the country for us. He was ready to answer any questions whether it was about the Call to Prayer, Moroccan marriage traditions, or current Moroccan politics. After the trip, Abdul took the time to take us through the square and point out all of the good food stalls, which I proceeded to sample the rest of the trip. Marrakech can be a bit overwhelming for a newcomer. A great way to ease into the city and Morocco in general is to book a day with Abdul. Ryan"

The reviews for this company [Marrakech Guided Day Tours] were excellent and we made contact to agree dates and times. Responses were prompt with a brochure attached to give us an idea of what was available.We chose a full day in Marrakech [souks and sights] along with a second day trip to the Atlas Mountains. Both were very good. We found Abdul to be very informative and paced the tours to suit us. On the Atlas Mountain tour we had with a meal in the home of a local Berber family in a stunning setting. It was first class and probably one of the best meals of our trip, very fresh and very clean all at a reasonable price. Abdul is multi lingual his spoken english is very good and easy to understand.

We were a group of 5 women and we hired Abdul because we wanted to learn about the history of these two beautiful places whilst feeling secure with someone who knew the souks and backroads. Abdul wove the history of Marrakech into our wonderful trip and told us about architecture and founding kings and the Morroccan way of life. He was a very thoughtful guide and really undsertood our needs as a group and found us some lovely little resturants along the way. In Essouira, we heard about the history of the town, the Mellah, the beautiful old port and he gracefully answered all our questions about every aspect of history and Morrocan life. He took us to meet a shepard with goats in trees, a womens' co-operative (which we loved) and we felt safe, happy and looked after at all times. His driver, Uniss, drove us with care and made little stops as often as we wanted. We have never hired a guide before and we now realise how much we have missed that cannot be gleamed from guide books. By the end of our long but action packed weekend we were firmly under the spell of Marrakech and a little under the spell of our wonderful guide Abdul. It was worth every penny."

This was my second trip to Marrakech, and he introduced me to the sub quarters of the city, which I never paid mind to, and he also showed us what was behind some doors. By looking into these places, we were able to taste a few bread, hear Gnaoua music and see things generally not included in a cookie-cutter tour. I was so impressed with Abdul. He would deliver information with sycg great thoughtfulness and at a tempo that was easy to absorb. I know Ill be back, hopefully with more groups of curious Morocco seekers and the first order of business will be to have Abdul make the introductions to this amazing city. Shokran Bissef Abdul!!!!"

He was very communicative and answered my emails (which were plentiful) promptly and thoroughly.In all of my travels, I have never encountered a tour guide like Abdul. We were three girls with varying interests and yet he found a way to tailor the tours (realtime) to appeal to us all (talk about patience!). He speaks impeccable English and his demeanor immediately puts you at ease..which is important as sometimes the sights, sounds, and smells of Marrakech can be an onslaught on your senses.. He gave us history lessons and insights into Moroccan customs and culture, took us on a walking tour through Marrakech's serpentine streets, introduced us to some of the most skilled artisans in the souks (and helped us barter too!), and recommended some of the best restaurants. **I really recommend the day trip to Essaouria - it is a magical town, and you will love stopping at the Argan Oil co-op along the way! **Not only that but I had a bit of an emergency while on the trip and he went out of his way to help me and make sure I was ok..I can't begin to describe how thankful I am for his kindness and generosity.

We booked two tours with Abdul (the Marrakech/Souks and the Essaouira Day tours). I HIGHLY recommend that Abdul introduce you to this enchanting city on your first full day. Abdul walked us through the old city, residential quarters, souks, medina, mosques, and everywhere in between while providing a layered history lesson about former ruling empires. Abdul tailored the tour to focus on our interests in architecture and history. Our day with Abdul truly prepared us for the week in Morocco. There's no way a visitor can truly appreciate the gems that Marrakech has to offer without a knowledgeable guide like Abdul to set the backdrop.Abdul and a driver escorted us to Essaouira for our second tour. The drive was a short 2.5 hr drive west of the city. This was a very laid back day with no set itinerary. We arrived at the GORGEOUS port by late morning. We were able to choose the best catches of the morning from local fishermen. We then took our fish to a type of \"restaurant\" where they grilled the seafood for us. This may have been the BEST MEAL we've had our entire trip. Abdul is simply the best guide we've ever had. He answered all of our questions and made sure we were prepared for the week of \"haggling\" in the souks. We also appreciated his willingness to take us to local eateries that were off the beaten path. These gems turned out to be the best food we'd eaten during our stay. Abdul is kind, patient, knowledgeable, and funny. He unlocked the Magic of the city for us. I can't recommend him enough.

I emailed him before we arrived for advice and decided to book a full day tour (Hidden Sides) on our first day and another half day tour the following morning to explore the Souks. We enjoyed both days so much. We learned so many interesting facts about Marrakech, met so many interesting local people and Abdul treated us as friends, so much so that we missed him for the rest of the holiday! We did another tour to the desert which was fantastic but would have been so much better if Abdul were with us!We were happy to let Abdul show us around without a particular agenda but he is very quick to pick up on the types of things that you enjoy and tailors the trip according to your tastes. We saw so much beautiful architecture and Abdul was so knowledgeable about the history of the place, the culture and he makes it seem so easy to navigate when you are with him! He took us to a fantastic place to eat which we never would have ventured to if we were alone and this I think is the best thing about taking a tour with Abdul. Marrakech is a wonderful place, but it can also be slightly overwhelming and having someone so calm and knowledgeable by your side immediately makes you feel at ease so that you can relax and experience things that you may not allow yourself to if you were alone. We met a local baker, the man that lights the fires for the Hammam who sang for us and many tradesmen and skilled workers that Abdul thought we would be interested in meeting. When he takes you to meet these people there is no pressure to buy anything from them or to give them money (although we chose to), it is all for the experience and this was the part of the tours that we loved the most, so interesting and such good memories to take away!On the souks tour I assured Abdul that I was skilled at bartering and did not need his help so he stood a short distance away pretending to look the other way while a merchant wrapped scarves around my head and I tried to barter with him. Eventually I just heard a calm voice say \"Sam, would you like some help?\". I immediately accepted and he gave the merchant a telling off and let me barted again. I was really pleased with the deal I got but then Abdul spoke to him again and he gave me some more change so Abdul clearly wasn't pleased with the deal that I got! After that Abdul gave me a good talking to about how the merchants are just trying to earn a living to feed their families but that they can sometimes be very pushy and that I should not be forced into buying something that I did not want or paying more than I expect to pay for something. From then on he kindly did all my bartering for me but after he left us his talk still had an effect on me and I would find myself walking away after either buying something or deciding not to, saying to my husband, \"I think Abdul would have been proud of me then!\"He was so respectful, polite, warm, friendly and protective of us and went out of his way each day to make us happy. When I visit Marrakeck again I will definitely book Abdul for his knowledge and company and I will recommend him to friends as I am recommending him to you now. Book a trip with him, it will make your holiday."

Abdul answered dozens of our questions about everything. He was very helpful in giving us acceptable ranges of prices for items in the souk where both buyer and seller would have an acceptable deal. His tours are completely customized as to what you what you want to do, but as he gets to know you, he will make sure to add on things he knows you should not miss. Best of all, he is really your personal guide, there were no attempts to make you go anywhere and/or visit merchants/restaurants he has a relationship with. My parents took a guided tour organized via our resort and wound up listening to an Argan oil presentation for 40 minutes; this will not happen with Abdul.Our second tour was a day trip to Essaouira from Marrakech with my parents and our kids. The van we had was brand new with air conditioning that worked! (the only time that happened during our trip) We had a wonderful walk around the city with lots of insight from Abdul. Once again he adapted our tour to allow us to go off and do what we wanted (art shopping for us, ice cream for the kids). My kids especially enjoyed a stop along the way where shepards put a flock of goats in a beautiful Argan tree!To top all of this off, it was Ramadan so Abdul was unable to eat or drink during our tours which made it all the more remarkable how patient and accommodating he was."

Both of these tours I would highly recommend, we got a great feel for the city, the people who live and work within; including the heritage of Marrakech. He is very knowledgeable of the city as he has lived and worked there all his life so is very keen on sharing his stories, he showed us a local Souk eatery which did not look much from the outside and we were a little nervous about eating there as you hear all the horror stories of people getting upset stomachs, yet we enjoyed this experience greatly and didn't suffer the next day either which was a bonus! Not being used to the negotiation in the Souk Abdul used his experience to recommend highly quality items, even helping haggle for the best price.We particularly enjoyed our second day, the tour of the mountain's taking a nice few hours walking through the villages themselves, which a large tour group would not be able to do; from doing this we got a over powering feel for how the Berber people live and work everyday. The day finished off by having a meal with a local family and a tea ceremony. Abdul also is a great photographer, knowing great spots and letting us take any opportunity we wanted to take pictures and taking a few snaps for us. Overall a very knowledgeable and interesting two days and highly recommend."

Abdul has lived in Marrakech all his life, he is extraordinarily knowledgable about Morocco on a whole. Abdul's manner is gentile, he was wonderful to be around and I looked forward to all our tours with him. Abdul went above and beyond to make me comfortable during our tours as I had hurt my foot before arriving in Morocco, he organised an wheel chair and pushed me around everywhere taking extreme care. I found that each tour we did was unique and we got to see the hidden secrets of Marrakech. Abdul helped us shop as will as recommended a number of restaurants all which were his favourites and did not disappoint. I am so glad I had the opportunity to meet this wonderful humble man. I highly recommend anyone visiting Marrakech to take Abdul as your guide you won't be disappointed."

We enjoyed half day Hidden Sites of Marrakech and following morning Abdul and driver Mohammed picked us up at 9am for day trip to High Atlas Mountain and what a truly wonderful day we had! escaping the heat of Marrakech (36c) Enroute we stopped in Asni and had an opportunity to stroll through the colourful weekly Saturday Market..then onwards and upwards into The High Atlas we went..we left our driver to start our \" gentle trek\" across the valley to Toubkal Kasbah.. I walk daily( never trekked) and my sister is not even a walker as such..and she was rather anxious at the thought of it but have no fear we really enjoyed it and its at you're own pace, walking through Berber villages we, had an opportunity to stop at a local Berber house for a comfort stop and the kettle was on for a cuppa!!Abdul nominated me to assist with tea making ceremony.. I'm a mug and tea bag girl so it was somewhat of a challenge but we had a good laugh.. and amazing the tea was actually drinkable. We arrived at Toubkal Kasbah in time for lunch on the terrace.. views breathtaking overlooking snow capped Mount Toubkal and the valley below..it was a lovely relaxing 2 hours, wishing we could have stayed there longer, I hope to return to Toubkal Lodge and do some more trekking in high atlas soon( I've got the trekking bug!!) we then headed down to Imlil 20 minutes down a very uneven path and certainly not for those with any kind of walking difficulties.( mules are available for hire)Both tours were superb, Abdul is such a really nice laid back type of a guy and we just loved his dry sense of humour..Inshallah we will return to Marrakech sometime soon.. We would certainly recommend Abdul.. He is the perfect guide.... Simply the Best!!!"

We tried to book Abdul for the hidden sides tour for 1 day and a second day in the high atlas but there was a slight mix up so he made alternative arrangements for us.However, the hidden sides tour with Khalid was great. If you cannot get Abdul to show you around ask him to arrange for his friend Khalid to take you instead as he was very friendly, humble, knowledgeable and humorous. He not only showed us places of historic and religious interest, but also gave us an insight into the everyday working life of the ordinary Marrakshi, taking us to meet craftsmen making things from metal, wood and even the man who stokes the furnace of a Hamman and cooks the Tanjia for anyone who will pay a small fee at the same time! We felt a part of the city for a short time rather than confused tourists wandering around getting lost! We cannot thank Khalid enough.Now, back to Abdul. Having made alternative arrangements the first day we did not expect to meet him at our Riad the following morning but there he was to explain he would see us later during our trip to the Atlas Mountains. The driver was friendly, scenery spectacular and the Berber guide who took us on a trek was excellent. All this had been arranged by Abdul and we later met him properly at a Berber house for a wonderful meal and mint tea. He was a very interesting person with excellent English,great knowledge of his country and a funny guy as well! Even though he was not with us the whole two days he left a great impression on us and we would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone who wants a personal tour as he makes it all go so smoothly. A truly memorable day in the mountains."

The journey to Imli took about 2 hours , though we did stop a couple of times to take pictures. Once there our local guide asked what type of walk we we like to do. There was one of about 90 minutes that didn't involve so much uphill climbing but instead took you around some waterfalls. We opted for the one that was about 2 hours and took you up to a Berber village higher up the mountain before coming back down to the Berber house where we had lunch. Warning...don't book a meal for when you get back that night , you won't need it !. After the Tea Ceremony we had a huge salad, supplied with lots of break and Olive Oil. Following this we had a delicious Lamb Tagine. By then I was full, bit then another Tagind of Chicken and Cous Cous arrives. Finally fresh Fruit for dessert if you can manage it.After the meal it is about 20 minutes back to the car and 1 hour drive back to Marrakech.Overall best day of our trip to Marrakech.

He answered every question we had and set a great leisurely pace.The highlights of the tour were going to the bakery, going to the man who heats the hammam (and his musician friend who put on an impromptu performance and gave us castanets to keep), and visiting the souks and seeing the guy who carves wood with his feet!I mentioned to Abdul that I had been in the market for a pouf for a long time, and he went on a adamant rant about the best person to buy poufs from. Abdul is clearly passionate about poufs and takes it quite seriously ;) Anyway, we brought some beautiful poufs that he guaranteed the quality and condition of for 20 years :)We would recommend a day with Abdul to anyone!"

We booked the full day medina tour, and Abdul arrived at our riad on-time in the morning. We discussed with him what we would like to see, a conversation we were ill-prepared for I have to admit, but we opted to go for 'an orientation tour' and 'see some hidden sights' - Abdul delivered. In total we walked around 10 miles (calculated by my iPhone steps) so it's not for the feint hearted, but I'm sure he'd accommodate everyone's needs and abilities (we are an early-30s couple).His English is exceptional, and he showed around the whole medina, orienting us without being too forceful; 'you remember this?', 'look for this sign', etc, all things we used throughout our stay. We went to Dar Cherifa, a beautiful converted riad, a fully working community bakery where we sampled some homemade bread (we loved this bit - very rustic) and we also went to Ben Youssef Madrasa, an old Islamic college. We had to pay a very small fee for the latter but it is well worth seeing. He helped us haggle and orient ourselves in the souks, and recommended some very good stalls in the night market on Jamma el Fna. I cannot begin to describe in a review how useful and pleasant our experience was. If you aren't that well travelled and/or haven't been to Marrakech, as we are/hadn't, you MUST do this and you MUST use Abdul!!"

Abdul brought cookies and notebooks for the children, which were greatly appreciated, and added to the experience in meeting and interacting with the children. Abdul arranged for a wonderful luncheon at a Berber guest house, where the family prepared a delicious meal (tajine, couscous, salad, etc.), all served on the veranda with the best view of the Atlas mountains.

Abdul not only met our needs but he went above and beyond. As our teenage girls would say to him, \" You've Abdul yourself!\" During our week, we visited Essaouria, the souks in the Medina and the Atlas Mountains ( bring proper footwear!) The highlight of our trip for sure was learning about the Berber way of life in the Atlas Mountains. Abdul bought pens and coloring books for our daughters to hand out to the Berber children. The look of delight on their little faces were so precious! We later enjoyed a delicious traditional lunch on the rooftop of Berber home. Our daughters learned to make mint tea and was given Moroccan outfits to wear. Great weather, views, food and company, a perfect day!  At the end of our week, we felt we made a friend and Abdul left a lasting impression on our girls. He is very proud of what he does and genuinely wants you to have a great vacation.

We enjoyed Abdul's laid back approach but we still crammed in a lot of walking and learning in this beautiful city. He let us determine the pace and the areas we wanted to visit and gave us plenty of time to explore. He was with us except for a lunch break which he used for prayer. A delightful guide and a fantastic day."

We had Abdul to ourselves for a whole day, which made a huge difference as it gave us time to both see and learn about the main sights of the Medina, but also to ask many questions about Moroccan culture, Islam, the history and way of life in Marrakech. Abdul's English is very good and he is easy to talk to. By the end of the tour, which we did on our first full day in Marrakech, we had a much better idea how to get around, the things to be careful of (e.g. traffic of all shapes and sizes) and he gave us many suggestions as to things to see and do. By the end of the day we were quite tired but had thoroughly enjoyed learning so much about this fascinating (and sometimes daunting) city."

Abdul is delightfully cultured and knowledgeable and has a wicked sense of humour! We learned so much more than we had expected to. To tell you what we did would spoil the treat you have in store.The following day we were collected from our hotel in a comfortable and new SUV for the trip to Essaouira. The driver was great and we continued our conversations of the previous day. Essaouira provides a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of the souks of Marrakech. I loved it - in fact I believe I could easily live there and certainly intend to return! Abdul showed us the sights and informed us of the history as we wondered around soaking up the atmosphere. Then another surprise - which I also will not divulge!We learned so much of interest in our enjoyable two days with Abdul. Thank you for enriching our lives."

The directions with regard to where to meet were easy to follow and we found each other without any problems!The tour itself was fantastic - Abdul took us to all the places we wouldn't of gone to by ourselves; walking us through the residential areas of the Medina, explaining in detail about the history and culture of Marrakech. He really did show us hidden treasures such as taking us inside a bakery where we tasted freshly baked bread, visiting a beautifully converted Riad and even showing us his old primary school! Abdul also gave us helpful tips on how to navigate around the souks so we wouldn't feel so lost when we visited them again and recommended us towards the best cafes and food stalls. Abdul really was lovely and made us feel very welcome; his tour was personal and suited us as he focused on culture and the local people rather than filling our heads with a lot of facts and history. I would definitely recommend Abdul if you wanted to head off the beaten path from the main souks and discover something different in Marrakech."

He asked what we were hoping to see, and just told him we wanted his recommendations as this was our first day in Marrakech. His English is very good and he is very knowledgeable about the city and its history. For the first half hour or so he gave us quite a bit of history while we walked, maybe a bit more than we were interested in to be honest, but this was only at the beginning. The tour was conducted at a leisurely-paced walk which was nice since we were toting along a child. He suggested several stops to give us some insight into local life, but these were always proposed as optional and there was never any pressure applied to visit them. If there were additional costs involved, such at the museums, Abdul was very upfront about these costs and again everything was completely optional. There were conveniently timed and adequate bathroom facilities throughout the tour, which lasted a total of about 3 1/2 hours. We wanted to see the souks, but not waste too much of our time with Abdul there. He walked us through a few sections, but more importantly gave us some orientation so we could return again later on our own time. I highly recommend this tour with Abdul, especially early in your visit to Marrakech."

We organised a full day city tour with Abdul on our first day in Marrakech, on the first day of the new year (1 Jan 2015). This turned out to be a most enjoyable way to start the new year, and gave us an excellent orientation to the Marrakech medina. Abdul began by asking us what we wanted to get out of the tour, and after reading a number of reviews on TripAdvisor, we wanted to focus on the 'real' Marrakech, behind the scenes, along with a focus on art, architecture and history. Abdul collected us from our Riad on time and we spent the day exploring the medina and souks. His English was excellent, as was his historical and local knowledge. One thing that we particularly valued was that we had just come from Granada and visiting the Alhambra, and Abdul helped us to better understand the impact and links of moorish art and history between Granada and Morocco. The tour took a relaxed pace, and overall we found Abdul's relaxed demeanour reassuring in the hustle and bustle of the medina. (We adopted his relaxed approach for the rest of our stay, helping make this a fabulous holiday). We took plenty of stops for photos, browsing, discussing and food as needed (he took us to a delightful little place for local, selling delicious broadbean soup for lunch - one of my favourite meals of our trip). We found Abdul very trustworthy and honest and if we had needed someone to help guide us on a shopping trip, he would have been perfect. Be sure to book home well in advance."

On both days Abdul met us promptly at our riad and was friendly accommodating and very knowledgeable throughout. On the hidden sides tour he took us to some fascinating and lesser known sights of the city as well as the \"must see\" areas. We had an excellent lunch on a terrace of a restaurant called \"Kui-ZIn\" which I would also highly recommend- the food, service, cleanliness and prices would be hard to beat. On the Atlas mountain tour Abdul arranged a very nice mini bus for us all with a careful driver who took us up a mountain pass into the national park. We were delighted to meet a Berber family there who made us extremely welcome and cooked an amazing 4 course lunch for us. We also had great fun joining in traditional tea ceremony and meeting the local children. Overall we had a memorable weekend and thoroughly enjoyed Abdul's company along the way. We learned a lot about the history of Morocco and Islam and had some interesting discussions along the way. He made our trip effortless and took care of all the little things like tipping( if we wanted to take photos), negotiating the public toilets etc as well as advising us on local customs etc He is a genuine person and did not try to sell us anything or pressurise us into doing anythingThank you very much Abdul!

Quickly he geared the tour to exactly what we liked and took us into the souks, explaining how they work, how the developed and then looking at each craft/trade in turn. What became apparent is that he knows a lot of people in the media, which is a good sign and that he has a great sense of humour!. Abdul took us through how to judge quality and price, including haggling, but more that just lecturing he encouraged us to assess for ourselves how to spot cheap tourist products and the real local high quality products. What was good to see is that he picked up items for his family on the way round which steered us to the types of things that we would like.Anyway, I'm waffling, the highlights of the tour are: - Visiting a 90 year old shoe maker and looking at his handmade slippers. - Picking our a second hand Moroccan tea pot in a genuine tea pot shop. - Drinking mint tea from a seller which had been operating in the souks for hundreds of years. - The glass seller who my wife thought was lovely - Seeing the places where the craftsmen work rather than the touristy market stalls around the Jemaa  - Sitting and chatting with Abdul over good coffee, where his natural friendliness, knowledge and humour kept us captivated Marrakech is a bit like and iceberg, you only see 10%, but with a guide like Abdul you get to see and understand the other 90!"

If it's your first time to Marrakesh then there's no better way to explore the old Medina then with a private guided tour with Abdul!The Souk can be quite daunting with the numerous alleyways and passages leading off the main road - Abdul was kind enough to show us how to navigate the Souk, the landmarks to watch out for and also how to find our Riad again! After that we didn't need a map any more!There is so much heritage and culture in the old medina that you really need someone who knows the history, architecture and the people in order to fully experience Marrakesh! If you end up on one of those large guided tours, then you are just shepherd from place to place and only get to see Marrakesh from the outside.Abdul made the tour personal, he took us to all the nooks and crannies of Marrakesh, places that you would never experience on a big tour!We broke bread with a local community baker, we had tea with the person who heats up the community hammam.Abdul was fantastic! He is very knowledgeable, professional, kind and willing to answer all our questions.We've been on numerous private tours around the world, and were amazed at how much he knew about the history of Marrakesh. There's not an area on the walk around the town where he wasn't pointing out a historical fact or figure!What we really appreciated was how much Marrakesh and the Moroccan culture meant to Abdul. His passion for his work really shines through!Abdul also knows all the good places to eat in Marrakesh and took us to Chez Lamine for lunch, we enjoyed an excellent Tangia and Mechoui, so much so that we went back again for our final meal in the city.We actually went overtime by half an hour but he didn't mind at all... now I call that dedication. It was such a shame we were too late to book him for his other tours as I'm sure we would have enjoyed his company at Essaouira or even the Imlil Valleys (which we did on his recommendation!)We left the tour fully enriched with Moroccan culture and also happy that we had made a new friend."

He was prompt, very knowledgeable, answered all my questions and gave me a great overview. He made sure to ask if there was anything I really wanted to see to make sure it was included in the tour and gave me plenty of time at each stop to take pictures.

Abdul provided a tailored and personal tour through the hidden sights of Marrakesh (purely based on our interests), which he established at the start of the tour. We explored the history, the culture and the magic of the city through his eyes. He walked us from the Koutoubia minerate through the Medina, showing us gems and hidden treasures within the city. We delved into the changes in architecture, design and layout of the Medina throughout time and how it affected the everyday lifestyles of the locals. To cap it off we ended up in the Souks and took in the vibrance and colour of the main square. We grabbed a bite at one of the market kiosks (highly recommend their food, was the best food we had during our stay). His company was super, he made us feel relaxed and right at home from the beginning. If like us, you want an informed and personable guide to show you the quirky side of the Medina, Abdul is your man.Thanks for everything!Salam"

            "review": "The best way to explore Marrakech with a side of shopping!. From the moment I arrived in the Medina, the walled city, of Marrakech, Morocco I encountered a world unlike any I had ever seen. To the uninitiated it seems at first an incomprehensible warren of narrow walkways and narrower alleyways, with occasional streets wide enough for automobiles. It is a world of deeply hidden interiors, lived enclosed, all of which presents as a mystery to the traveler. Thankfully my husband and I and another couple had the wisdom to engage a guide and we spent our first full day in the Medina exploring the city with Abdul Aissaoui of Marrakech Guided Tours (contactmarrakechguidedtours@gmail.com). With him, a native of Marrakech, we soon began to see order, the warren of streets became neighborhoods, we discovered amazing and beautiful worlds behind inauspicious and locked doors, we heard stories of the city's almost 1000 year old history, we saw the snake charmers and the monkeys and the myriad of activities in the central square, we paused for coffee in an ancient arched and tiled inner courtyard, we had a delicious lunch of lamb roasted until tender in a giant clay pot buried in the ground, varieties of olives, marinated, spicy and mild, sour pickles, rounds of fresh warm bread and pots of beef, olive oil, garlic and rosemary cooked for hours in the steam used to heat the hamams, we learned about the Koutoubia Mosque and heard the call to prayer from its magnificent minaret, walked deep into the souks and saw how the vendors were sorted by type of merchandise offered, watched the end of day rug auction, saw the food vendors, marveled at the many varieties of olives, the mounds of dates, and the many aromas of the spice vendors, and we timidly forayed into the world of bargaining for purchases. By the end of our day together we could begin to pick out landmarks and had a general idea of how to wend out way back to our hotel. Abdul loves his city, he knows all of its hidden secrets and he delights in their revealing. He patiently and thoroughly answered our many questions, deftly maneuvered us in and out of the city's many byways, and laughed with us as we gingerly made our first attempts at bargaining. While he showed us he taught us and he opened our eyes to the many facets of the Medina and by the end of the day we had a vastly enlarged sense of its varied pleasures and delights. I am certain that had we ventured out on our own even with many days we would never have seen what we saw with Abdul in our one day together. If you are planning a first visit to Marrakech, or even if you have already been, engaging him as a guide will vastly enlarge your appreciation and enjoyment of the city. He is a charming man, very knowledgeable and speaks excellent English. As I write this I am smiling as I remember what a marvelous time we had together. If you choose to engage Abdul I am certain that like us you will have a remarkable and memorable day. After realizing how much we had enjoyed our time together and how hopeless we were at bargaining we decided to avail ourselves of Abdul's shopping tour of the souks. We had one morning to shop and doubtless on our own we would have spent most of our time just trying to find our way around. With Abdul we were introduced to the artisans and the best vendors for the items we were wanting to buy. He interpreted for us, acted as intermediary, helped us negotiate, and judging by the number of bags we carried back to our hotel, helped us have a very satisfactory shopping experience. There are many, many wonderful things to buy in the souks and markets of Marrakech and without help you will most assuredly pay considerably more than you should. With help you will go to the best vendors and you will pay a fair price. It might seem absurd to hire someone to take you shopping but a few minutes in the souks will convince you of the wisdom of doing so. In this I can guarantee you will be 100% satisfied!"

We booked Abdul following recommendations on TripAdvisor, and have to say he helped us make the most of our short stay. Abdul tailored the tours to our interests (including photography), and showed us parts of Marrakech we would never have seen without him, including 'behind the scenes' tours of the public Hammam and community bakery. He even took the time as we walked away from our Riad on the first day to look backwards when we reached certain landmarks to show us how to find our way back. Really useful in the maze of the Souks. Take a comfortable and trusted pair of shoes, mine broke after 2 1/2 hours of walking and despite Abdul and the local cobbler's best efforts I had to walk barefoot (in the rain) until we could buy a new pair of shoes (and it was my birthday)! Abdul's best tip for crossing the road: 'If you're scared, just close your eyes and walk...'. Hilarious (if a little unnerving!) but it definitely worked :o) He was also happy to advise on things like what a taxi should cost, which street stalls served the best food, where to buy the best spices, etc etc. He even checked with us regularly about bathroom visits as he knew where the cleanest facilities were...We thoroughly enjoyed our time with Abdul, he was interesting, intelligent, and extremely knowledgeable and his English was perfect. Our only regret is that we weren't there for longer - we would have loved to go into the mountains, and to Essaouira. Maybe next time!"

We contacted Abdul who was not free on the dates we wanted, he made a number of recommendations in terms of people to contact and we had a wonderful guide called Khalid Amor. His spoken English is perfect, he is intelligent and knowledgeable and has much patience.The other very noticeable thing about Khalid is his kindness to others.We had a day trip to Atlas Mountains, which is a must. To have the opportunity to witness how families live, the simplicity of their lifestyle, is humbling. The Berber lunch was tasty, loads of food, amazing hospitality, nothing was too much bother. We were able to appreciate what the impact of tourism has on families. The owners of the house where we had lunch showed us their home and told us of plans to extend and add new features to it so that they can offer short term accommodation to trekkers. Without tourism this would not be possible.The majority of the trip was made in a 4x4 -the short amount of time we spent walking was pretty arduous. Gravel, loose stones and rocks, steep inclines, dust and dirt....and this is how the locals get around! From when they are able to walk, their terrain is exactly this. They walk, jog, run, confidently and fluidly, the children play and the adults work. Animals, rabbits, cats, sheep, goats form part of the village.We loved our day and I highly recommend you do this.Our 2nd day with Khalid was the Hidden Tour of Marrakech. He picked us up at 10am from the Riad and we walked around monumental buildings and gardens, the souks, down dark alleys and into a very talented friend of his who was a blacksmith and then on to see a baker, who works 18 hours a day in front of an open oven, baking loaves for the locals.. We had lunch in the heart of the medina. The table and chairs and general surroundings were basic to say the least, but the food, once again was awesome. The service was spot on.Food generally was salads, fresh bread, oils, olives. Meat grill, cous cous, vegetables including Quince which I ate for the first time. All very tasty and generous portions.The square comes alive at 5pm onwards with food stalls, snake charmers, dancers, musicians, smells, noise, people. It is absolutely full on...oh- there were also 2 stalls selling false teeth!Do not expect to be able to take a photo without paying the subject matter some money. They will chase you for money and are very insistent.At one point I wanted to photograph some cats getting fed innards by a local butcher counter. I could, as long as I paid the butcher a tip.The souks are alleyways crammed with goods and people wanting you to buy from them. So be prepared for constant interruptions. Also be prepared for the chickens sold live then slaughtered on site, the goats heads and feet on display, the prepared carcasses hanging up waiting to be sold. Like many other countries, Marrakech have to feed themselves and the whole process of animal slaughtering is just a part of life.You will see mules pulling carts and will have to develop amazing senses to deal with the scooters being rode through the streets and souks at incredible speeds. Khalid helped us to make sense of it all. I would recommend to anyone visiting here for the first time, get a guide or you will miss so much of what makes this destination so magical.The only one downside and it wasn't really a down side as such, just a bit disappointing that we were taken to a shop that sold oils and tea and natural products. We were actually taken here for mint tea but quickly had a price list put in front of us. We succumbed and bought a few items and came away \u00a337 lighter! Once I got home and unpacked and looked again at what we had bought I realised we had been well and truly over charged...but there we are. The traders rely on us to provide a market for their products and I guess I should feel thankful that I can afford to be on holiday in Marrakech in the first place."

By the time we contacted him for our holiday he was only available for one day during our visit. Thankfully that number was greater than zero and we immediately booked for a day trip to Essaouira for our family of four with two teens (boy-15, girl-13).On the previous three days we engaged four other guides/companies for an all-day tour of the city/museums/gardens & souk; mountain biking in the Atlas and visiting a Berber family; and a cooking course. While those experiences were all fantastic, here's what I feel differentiated Abdul:* The pace of the tour. Granted, the Essaouira trip was designed to be more relaxed than say ticking off five museums in a morning in Marrakech, but you know when a guide is already walking away while you are still reading a sign or taking a photo or just their energy is restless? That's not Abdul. We managed to tick all the boxes on the agenda for the day - the argan cooperative, the souk, lunch, the fort, tea on the beach, etc. - without feeling rushed.* The conversation. I appreciated having a driver to focus on the driving (hours) AND a guide to focus on our experience and answer questions. I appreciated his perspective on politics in the region and the dozens of other questions I asked. It was educational.* The initiative to take photos. Before we asked he volunteered to take photos of us and was an experienced location scout. Usually I'm taking all the photos for my family so I'm glad at the end of a trip to have a few which include all of us. And his photos are good. I have some hilarious trees-coming-out-of-people's-heads or bizarre-framing or blurry photos taken by random helpful tourists, so it's nice to have some good family snaps."

Be assured after traveling thousands of miles, across continents, you will be in very good hand with him. He is gentle, kind and educated. Spending my 1st day with him was brilliant. I felt like I was in a bubble of safety with him. He knows everything about Marrakech - even the locals stop to ask him for help. Abdul it was wonderful to have an opportunity to share time with you absorbing your knowledge about Marrakech. I can't thank you enough and will never forget you.

He introduced us to a local Berber that took us on a trek around the beautiful villages at the foot of the mountains. The lunch was amazing. I wish we could have gone on a city tour with Abdul but we just didn't have time, he is a great guide with passion for helping the local people. I can't recommend him enough, he was fab.Kind regards for the food recipes, we will try them soon and send you a photo of our efforts. Ps on our last night the torch man wasn't there and there was unsurprisingly a light to find our way back to the riad, May be he took the bulb out after all haha. Thanks Abdul, you were great fun. And I will never forget the smell of that goat costume the boys were running around the village in haha.Jade and Mark"

My boyfriend and I have just come back from our first trip to Marrakech, and if it wasn't for Abdul our holiday would not have been as much fun. We booked the full day tour of Marrakech, and right from booking Abdul was so helpful, quick to respond to my emails and unlike a lot of tour guides planned the day around what we wanted to see.Abdul arrived promptly as arranged, and was so knowledgeable and entertaining. He showed us some of the tourist sights, but we also got to experience \"real marrakech\", visiting the local bakery and meeting the man who keeps the hammam fire alight, which was an amazing experience.I will be honest with you, when we first arrived we thought we would never be able to leave our Riad, because we thought we may never find it again!!! (Marrakech is a bit of a maze) but thanks to Abdul he taught us the easiest way to navigate around the city, and once our tour was over we felt so confident.Paying for this tour was the money well spent, my advice to anyone going to Marrakech is BOOK ABDUL! Whether this is your first trip, or your tenth trip, you won't regret it."

Abdul was very knowledgeable, quick to respond to emails, and easy to talk with. It was great to have someone explain the history and guide us through the maze that is the Medina. I honestly cannot imagine figuring out where to go in the Souks without him there. Was so happy we did the tour with him on our first day there it was a great foundation for knowing where to go and how things worked in the medina. The fact that Abdul grew up in the Medina is also an added bonus we got to see really cool local places within the medina. Abdul gave my husband and I plenty of time to look around at different places and take pictures. Honestly I was nervous about going to the Medina at first but I felt completely safe with Abdul as our guide and felt a ton better about walking around the medina after the tour. Definitely recommend a tour with him!"

The tour is 4 hours and Abdul gave us a very knowledgeable walk around the parts of Marrakech you simply wouldn't see without Abdul. We took in the historic background of the city from 1000 years ago, right through to the residential quarter of the Medina, some beautiful Riads and Palaces, we even visited Abdul's primary school and a public bakery service that the locals use to bake their loaves. There was no pressure to visit Souk's or buy anything. Abdul appeared to be friends with every other person living in the Medina, it was quite inspiring to watch. Was interesting to hear about the currently political situation in Marrakech. His style is very laid back and was a pleasure to take the tour with him. I was surprised at how quickly 4 hours passed. My brother and I did the tour with Abdul, and I would recommend doing it in a small group like that, as the larger tours didn't seem nearly as personal or fun. We found loads of places and hidden streets we went back to after the tour too. Thanks again Abdul!"

This was based on the excellent comments I read on the website and the extent to which the tour was described as flexible. We were a family of 7 and booked the full day tour. Abdul got back to us almost immediately and everything was straightforward in meeting him in Reception at our hotel. Although we were frequently asked if there was anything we wished to do or see in particular, this was difficult to answer as it was our first visit to Marrakech so we were very much in Abdul's hands. We needn't have worried as Abdul took excellent care of us and we all enjoyed a fascinating and interesting tour including a visit to see the Koutubia Mosque ( you can't go inside ), Gemma El Fna Square, a refreshing mint tea on the rooftop of a beautiful riad with gorgeous views, a tour of Ben Yousseff School, a tour of the Souks, useful information regarding cafe's and restaurants, visited a working traditional Moroccan flat bread making oven and Abdul even took us to his local school and the area in which he grew up as a young boy. All thoroughly enjoyable, even though the sun defeated some of us in the end! The parts I enjoyed most were the mint tea riad, the bread making, school and souks. Oh we did stop for a well- earned lunch in the cafe des epices which was good. But don't hesitate to ask Abdul anything you wish to know or about anywhere you wish to go - the only thing you'll be short of is time and / or energy. Thank you Abdul"

We wisely decided to spend our first full day on the ground in Morocco with him in order to get an introduction and overview of the city. What a GREAT decision. Our day was awesome. First, Abdul was very warm and friendly. His English was impeccable and easy to understand. He was a vast repository of knowledge and really tailored our tour with the things we were interested in seeing. If we had a question about something, whether history related, social or religion related, there was no topic off limit, and he was more than willing to help us understand his country and people.As an added plus, he led us to a fabulous place, which we would never have ventured into by ourselves, for lunch.The price for a full day tour with Abdul was very reasonable and I can't overemphasize how great of a guide he was. If we return to Marrakech, you can bet your bottom dollar that we will book another tour with him in order to see a different part of the city with his help next time.And, if like us, you are doing research for your first visit to Marrakech, please strongly consider making a day with Abdul one of your 'must-dos' - and do it as early into your trip as possible. He will give you a great introduction and background so that you feel confident exploring the city on your own.Thanks again for a great day Abdul. We hope to meet you again."

We were travelling with our 4 young children so we booked a half day tour for our second day. I can't rate Adbul and his tour highly enough. We were a little apprehensive about taking the children around the souks etc, and we did want our \"hands held\" slightly to give us a quick orientation. Abdul covered all this and more. He specifically tailored our tour to suit the children and their little feet not wanting to walk too much, and for our desire for them to see different parts of the souks. It was lovely to see Abdul greeting people and taking us to places we NEVER would have found unless by accident, while sharing his love and knowledge of this amazing city. I believe that this experience seeing the city through Abdul's eyes really helped shape our opinions and experience of the city from there on in and has left a true love of the city embedded in our children who can't stop talking about when they are going to come back when they grow up. We saw so much, but at a leisurely pace that suited our needs. If we had visited the souks without Abdul initially we may have felt harassed and perhaps put off revisiting but he quickly explained the love of life, happiness and banter that characterize the souks, let us try haggling and even when the tour was finished took my partner back to buy waterproof shoes (the hotel pool floor was cutting the childrens feet) The fact that he could find somewhere to buy them straight away is evidence of this mans true knowledge of the souks!! We wished we had booked him for further tours as he is such a lovely gentleman. Please do not hesitate to book with him..it will be the best choice you can make."

We arrived in Marrakech with the intention of seeing as much of the city attractions that we could and also wanted to visit a Berber village in the Atlas mountains.Our Riad owner had a leaflet for the mountains but it wasn't really what we wanted so we logged on to Trip advisor and chose this one,(Having already briefly looked before the holiday at tourism sites).The website was clear and precise so we sent an online request through to do the half day city tour and Atlas mountain trip with a couple of date options, Abdul promptly replied and arranged to meet us as our Riad.Having a guide to take you through the maze that is Marrakech centre makes it so much easier and clearer to get to the attractions and also get your bearings and sense of direction back! (We had spent our first 2 days wandering around the same route not realising there were shortcuts!).Abdul's knowledge and pride in his home city shine through and it is so much more interesting to hear personal stories too, you can literally talk about anything with him from politics to football or religion to lifestyle. He also shows an interest in you as well and is really easy to get to know, this obviously makes the tour a lot easier, comfortable and informal.It's useful to have a photographer on hand too, to be fair he takes a good photo!Next up we did the Berber mountains, this trip is such a great experience, that really made the holiday for me, Abdul and his driver picked us up from our Riad, drove us to the foot of the mountains (About an hour and a half) and we then had a light trek to a Berber home, the views are absolutely amazing, the air fresh and the local's warm and friendly along the way. I urge anyone with intention of doing this trip to take some stationary for the local children, they are so grateful for it and you will feel glad you did when you see their reactions.We met the home owner who was preparing a meal for us but first we had a tea ceremony, it takes half an hour to make but is worth the wait!Lunch was a nice salad, tagine and cous cous, followed by fresh fruit picked that morning, we commented on how nice the cherries were so en route back down the mountain we stopped to pick our own!!The home owner was a pleasure to meet, 26 years old, speaks four languages, does trekking tours and has aspirations to set up a lodge style business for the serious trekkers, he deserves every success and we swapped email addresses so hopefully will be able to see his progress.Overall we were very pleased to have done both of these trips and I would recommend them to anyone, also I wouldn't leave it until you arrive in Marrakech to book them as you can arrange from home before you go.We were lucky that it was a quiet time for tourists when we went so we got our chosen trips, but I would hate to think that we could have missed out on these experiences by not booking in time.Also in case you were unsure about going around the city with an old man, that isn't Abdul in the profile picture above, he's a bit younger than that!!!!!!!Thanks Abdul, 2 great trips that made our holiday! ;-)"

So we walked around some historical quarters and monuments, we visited the Ali Ben Youssef Madrasa learning about the beautiful islamic art and architecture. We ate a typical dish with locals and we visited a traditional bakery and leather and wood workshops: we also learned the art of haggling in the souks!

This was our first visit to Marrakech.Abdul met us promptly at our riad and led us on a tour that combined the medina, souks and several of the major historic and cultural sites as I'd requested. Abdul was vey willing to tailor the tour to our desires and adjusted to our needs as the day went on. As some other reviewers have described, Abdul can expose you to some truly local experiences that I'm sure many tourists never enjoy. These experiences proved to be some of the highlights of our entire two-week trip to Spain and Morocco. When I told Abdul that I'd made my own ras el hanout (a traditional Moroccan spice mix), he took us to his favorite spice vendor on our way back to the riad so I could purchase the authentic thing. It was so fragrant I couldn't believe it. I cooked with it the other night and not only did it taste great, it brought me back to our time in Marrakech.I highly recommend Abdul for his knowledge of this amazing city and his professional service."

I wanted to see the Medina, the souks and get a feeling for the people and the place. I wanted to see the craft and the craftsmen and to be able to navigate around Marrakech by myself. Abdul did all this and so much more. His well spoken narrative of history, surroundings and culture was informative and captivating.. He reminded me of a rhyme: \" I knew six very learned men they taught me all I knew, their names are what and why and when and how and where and who.\" This was Abdul - Very thorough and solicitous of my safety who allowed me to do things at my own pace. Even well after his ...responsibilities as a guide for one were over, he helped me with more than one crisis that arose. I am indebted to him, his graciousness and generosity and would recommend him to everyone. And did I mention he has a rare brand of honour and integrity for this day and age. * * * * * Cheryl Giamalis, Adelaide"

Sure, you could use a guidebook to learn the facts and figures but you would most definitely be missing out on a day spent with someone who has infinite knowledge and passion about the city and it's wonderful people. Ask Abdul all the questions you like and listen to a million interesting stories about the history and day to day life of the people around you. You will feel a lot more confident about dealing with local customs and negotiating for your treasures in the souks.Abdul goes above and beyond for his clients and will take you off the beaten path for a very memorable time."

We spent the day with Abdul yesterday and it was all we could have hoped.We are always a little nervous about spending a lot of time with someone we've never met but Abdul was friendly, interesting and had a rich vein of humour that put us at ease. Walking around Marrakech it was clear he knows many people and is well liked but we never felt that the day was outside of what we were interested in. There was not a long line of cousins waiting to sell us their goods.His English was very good and he took us around what we were interested in. On the way we did a large circuit of the city where we visited Dar Si Said (a museum of Morrocan arts), the old Jewish quarter, a number of nice places to have coffee and cake, a cobler, spice markets, a lamp shop, bakery, hammam oven and a general cross section of the souks. Really just a tour of life in Marrakech.Interspersed with all this he explained the culture and history of Marrakech and was never unable to answer our many questions. I couldn't recommend Abdul enough and if he hadn't been booked for the rest of the week we would have done more with him."

We met Abdul in the morning and he gave us a great insight to the history and background on Marrakech. He tailored the day to our needs and asked what we wanted to get out of it. He was a fountain of knowledge and had so much to share with us. We spent the day walking around Marrakech, went past riads, dar's, visited some museums, the local baker, the souks and ended up having a tasty meal before finishing our day in the afternoon. Abdul helped us understand the culture and also gave us a lot of tips on remembering our way around and ways to haggle with the souks! Abdul also helped us with directions on other places we wanted to visit later that week and also best places to buy things and exchange money for the best rates.I cannot thank Abdul for a great day, we really enjoyed our time with him. My advice would be make sure you have plenty of money exchanged in Dirhams, especially in small change as we made the mistake of only having big notes! Abdul can speak English really well, we had no problem understanding him at all. I recommend booking a day with Abdul if you really want to understand Marrakech and have a good laugh along the way. Thank you for looking after us Abdul."

A tour with Abdul is a different, and I imagine much better, experience than you're likely to have with many other tour providers in Marrakech. Abdul led a group of three of us around the city--rather than insist on hitting a handful of big and well-known sites and moving us from place to place, Abdul was an oasis of calm in a busy city, taking the time to really explain the history and culture of the city, how it's changed for better and for worse, and taking the time to answer our questions thoughtfully and in depth. His knowledge of Marrakech is deep and personal and his style focuses more on the experience of the tour group than rushing everyone around for it's own sake. If your own personal travel style places a greater emphasis on really getting to know a place over simply checking the boxes that you've seen a site listed in the guidebook, do yourself a favor and contact Abdul for a tour--you won't be disappointed."

We felt very comfortable with Abdul even though we booked a private tour (just my husband and I) and started to see his sense of humour come out the more time we spent with him. We know Abdul is well respected in the community as frequently people would come up to him and greet him kindly. He patiently answered our questions and taught us a lot about the Moroccan culture. Abdul helped us buy some Moroccan products (such as bitter orange blossom oil for cooking, Argan oil and couscous), using his negotiating talents to ensure we got the best products from the most reputable sellers that he, himself, even buys from. He brought us to a local tagine restaurant just off Jemaa el Fna where the locals eat, and we got to see a community bake oven and taste the bread. We met the man in charge of the fire for heating the hammam waters and heard him play his traditional goat skin guitar. We feel we got an inside look into Morocco and we would highly recommend Abdul. p.s. (the vehicle we used to get to Essaouira from Marrakech was a 6 seater, leather SUV and very very comfortable)."

I can not recommend this tour highly enough. Abdul arrived promptly at our Riad at 9.30 and our journey began. The tour is as specific or general as you want it to be. What my friend and I found invaluable is that Abdul took us places we would not have come across had we wandered the streets alone. For example we were taken to see the local bread ovens, where the women and children left their bread to bake in the mornings. This was in a very discreet doorway and had you not known it was there you would have gone straight past. Abdul not only gives you a sense of the history or Marrakech, but also gives you an idea of how the inhabitants live. The guide of the souks was fantastic, we were taken to corners that I am sure we would never have found had we been left to wander alone. Being able to see the metal workers and tanners working at their craft is a must see. Thanks to Abdul, we were not only able to find our way back to our Riad and to navigate the Souks successfully but we also had the confidence to go out and make the most of what Marrakech has to offer.Adbul has a great sense of humour, is very knowledgeable and was a pleasure to spend the day with.

My husband and I met with Abdul at our hotel to start our full day tour around Marrakech in early-March. Abdul asked us what exactly are we looking for, what is our goal to achieve and what do we want to see during our time with him. We told Abdul that are interest was to take great photos--and that's exactly what he showed us during our day with him. Abdul brought us to places that we would not have been able to find on our own like the local bread baker where all the families bring their dough to bake. Abdul was knowledgeable told us the history of the place. The tour was also at our own pace, we enjoyed many breaks to rest which Abdul brought us to a lot of great places to enjoy a cup of tea or coffee in great locations (roof top or in the heart of the market). My husband and I really enjoyed our tour with Abdul and highly recommend him. Abdul was very accommodating, he was professional and gave us a wonderful experience of our time walking through the Medina and Souks."

We met Abdul on our first full day in Marrakesh which was a great way to familiarise ourselves with the city as well as learn a whole lot about the culture and history. Abdul is very knowledgeable and has a great love for his 'home town' and tailored our tour to take in the sights we were interested in. If you're more interested in the lives of the people rather than the history leave out the Badi Palace where the storks next - you can go back to this on your own. I would have liked to have seen a school and the bread makers and wool dyers - but there just isn't enough time to do it all!We were particularly grateful that Abdul was willing to assist us in bartering for a couple of souvenirs which we just wouldn't have bought without him. He gave us the confidence to have a go ourselves the next day. As well as guiding us around, Abdul also made several suggestions of things we could go back to or do on our own - his great directions got us back through the souk to the Caf\u00e9 de Espice which is a lovely place to people watch. On another day we also took Abdul's tour to the Berber Village in the High Atlas mountains, which was a fabulous day. We were driven by a mountain guide who was happy to stop when ever there was a photo opportunity (quite often) and Abdul was very informative about the area we were passing through and the Berber house experience was something we would have missed out on without his help. We were shown the correct way to make mint tea, crack walnuts and eat with our hands with much laughter and good humour. I particularly enjoyed the opportunity to sit with the women of the household teasing wool and watching the children playing on the lower terrace.Thank you, Abdul. You made our holiday one to remember for a long time."

I was very clear - as two females (mother and daughter) travelling alone, my main concern was to be able to walk confidently round Marrakech and be able to orientate ourselves in terms of the key central areas of the city. Abdul clearly understood our concerns and managed not only to achieve this but also to show us some key historical sites and introduce us to something of the values and culture of Marrakech. We particularly loved the chance to visit a little kindergarten ( which he had attended himself as a child), the local bakery and a great place where locals had lunch ( we tried the tangia which was excellent.). Abdul also gave us advice on prices and bargaining in the souks and places to eat in Jamaa El Fna. All of his advice was totally sound and stood us in good stead for the rest of our visit.Abdul is a charming and respectful guide who is clearly passionate about his city - our private day tour was very well paced, with plenty of time to absorb the atmosphere and ask questions. The next day, when we were shopping in the souks, we met Abdul again, with another couple of visitors. It was great to see how pleased he was that we were happily and confidently negotiating the intricacies of the souks and the square. Job done!."

On viewing other past positive reviews on Abdul it made sense for us to book him for effectively our \"one day\" city tour. Abdul is very flexible on what places and things you would like to see. But obviously in the end it is impossible to practically fit everything in in one day. Overall, we were very glad that we booked the full day with Abdul. Nothing felt rushed and we were able to see pretty much most of the top five or six things we had selected at the beginning of our discussions to see (tanneries were unfortunately too far outside of the City centre to include and the tombs we prudently skipped as we had arrived too late in the morning and the queues were up to an hour long). If you truly want to experience the real side of Marrakech (not mentioned anywhere in 3 guide books I had)- where the locals buy their spices, meat, fruits and vegetables, where they actually eat (the chef in one of the restaurants we saw actually cooks for the King on occasions - and yes the food was very tasty as we had time for some lunch); where people take their bread in the morning to be baked; where the local people and also restaurants take their little clay pots for the meat and veg to be slow cooked; and also take in the whole manufacturing industry behind the souks giftware offerings (leather makers \u2013 shoes, belts; metal workers -lampshades etc. etc.) Abdul is the guide you need. Abdul, is very knowledgeable about most things we discussed, and made us feel instantly at ease walking around the city's secret back streets where inevitable we would have got lost and wasted our critical valuable time if we had gone alone. Overall, for all of the bad rumours we heard about being hassled and unfriendly people before we came, I would say that Marrakesh is the complete opposite. Abdul helps you understand that, and how life is there! After all, in the end, everyone is only trying to get by and make a living (including the snake charmers in the square \u2013 so don't try to be sneaky, just pay them a few coins for a picture = meal for their families). Even walking around the souks Abdul gave us an idea of finding our own way around whilst explained the art of bartering. On our own later, we did walk away on a couple of occasions when we were not happy with the price, and to be frank, in comparison we had more hassle in Istanbul main souk market a few years back. If we had had more time, or indeed decide to come back again for some winter sun, I would definitely book another tour with Abdul. Price is reasonable relative to time and other alternative guides that were available, plus he is flexible (we were a party of 2) but he allows up to 5 people should you are a bigger party or wanted to join up with other people."

Arranged in advance when searching on the internet not really knowing what to expect. The return e-mails from Abdul gave us confidence we had chosen a professional person. This was more than confirmed when Abdul came to our Hotel and introduced himself. Next thing we were on a bus heading into town to be expertly informed about the history and culture of this amazing city.The tour of the medina was interspersed with detours into wonderful places that one would not have otherwise discovered - suffice to say if you decide to go you too will enjoy the same experiences. We also booked Abdul to take us to a Berber house in the Atlas mountains where we enjoyed the hospitality and food of a young man who has set up a sustainable tourism destination Imlil Authentic Toublak Lodge for trekking holidays. If you have the good fortune to go to this place you will be amazed at the totally different way of life. The tranquility and beauty of this area is truly breathtaking. Please go to Marrakech and let Abdul show you the magic of the place."

This is my first time to the mysterious city of Marrakech and getting Adbul to take me on a full day tour around the town is one of the best decision I have made for this trip.Adbul have demonstrate his well knowledge and passion for the history, culture and religion for his city. I have learned a lot listening to him as he guided me through the Medina and souk. There are alot of hidden treasures and paths which he have walk me through that I wouldn't have been able explore by myself. Adbul really know the city at the back of his hand.Adbul have took me into one of the local cafe I wouldn't dare to go in myself to try out the Beef Tagine, and it is surprisingly tasty. One of the best I had in Marrakech.It's an amazing day out and it wouldn't be wrong if you decide to book him as your guide for Marrakech."

We booked a full day tour and it was super informative, interesting and a great value. We learned about spices, music, leather goods, history and found a new favorite sandwich that costs a euro! Our son got see so many things and taped some great stuff to show his classmates back home. Abdul is very polite and patient and his English is great. We also learned some Arabic words from him. He really caters the tour to what you want to do/see. I honestly wished that we would have hired him the whole time we were in Marrakech because it was so much easier and calmer when he was with us. He knows a great leather guy for Moroccan poufs and I might just take him up on his offer to send us one as we didn't buy one right then and then never found him again! The quality was great. I'm thinking of doing a girls shopping trip and believe me, he will hopefully be able to be with us the whole time! He obviously knows an astounding amount of things besides shopping tips, don't worry :) Wow, book him, book him, book him! Shukran Jazilan Abdul!!"

Whenever we go to a city where we have never been, we have gotten into the habit of hiring a tour guide for the first day to acclimate ourselves to the new environment. We found Adbul here on Tripadvisor while researching our trip to Marrakech. We arranged for him to meet us at our Riad the first day and hired him for a full day.From the first few minutes with Abdul, we knew we had made a good decision to hire him. His knowledge of the city, and the history, politics and religion that shape it, are truly second to none. We learned so much just by listening to him as he guided us through the Medina. I am certain we saw things that we never would have found without him.He took us to an amazing little restaurant in the souk, not sure of the name, but ask him to take you to the place where they serve steamed lamb. They lower it into a deep hole in the ground and slow roast it all day and then sell it by the kilo. You eat it with your fingers and dip it in salt and cumin. So delicious! We never would have found this place on our own and if we had, never would have dared to go in and eat, mostly because of the sheeps heads on stakes at the front! LOL! But it was amazing!He guided us through the souks with such expertise that it was actually a great, non/stressful experience. If you tell him what you are looking for, he can take you to the best places to get it and also tell you what you should expect to pay, which is very helpful.After our full day with Abdul, we dared to go out on our own the next day. it was a totally different experience. We got lost, got hassled by guys on the streets and were just not having fun. We looked at each other and laughed and said *We miss Abdul!!*. So we sent him an email and crossed our fingers that he had the next day available. He did, so we hired him for our last day, for another full day tour.The second day was just as good as the first. We went to the Jewish quarter, the Yves St. Laurent gardens and lots of shopping for fabulous Morrocan textiles.Abdul really goes the extra mile for his clients. NOTHING is too much. If you want something and cannot find it, don\\t be surprised if he drops it off for you at your riad. That is just the kind of guy he is. Thoughtful, generous, kind, smart and just nice to be around.Don't waste your money using anybody else. Abdul is as far as you have to look. He will make your Marrakech experience unforgettable and you will also leave having made a friend.We wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone who asked! Book him! NOW! Seriously!"

My wife and me have been there 5 years ago and we decided to come back with our kids 12 and 15, as we had wonderful memories from the first visit. This time we decided to organize our expeditions with a local tour guide as we did not dare to go everywhere last time.We found Abdul over the internet as he already had good reference. The alternative was to book the tours through our hotel. In the end I decided to go for Abdul as he was aready very proactive in suggesting interesting trips. We spent two days in Marrakech, one in a small Berber village in the Atlas mountains and one in a fishermen village called Essouira. Abdul was great and we could not have expected a better tour guide, as he showed us the secret cornes you would never see without a local guide. Abdul is not only very professional and highly educated but very much concerned and responsible about social minorities like children in Berber villages. I do highly recommend him. If you want to book a tour with Abdul you better get in contact with him at least two months ahead, as he is totaly booked out. One last thing. If you want to buy anything in Marrakech or during your trips, like spices, tea, argan oil, etc.. you have to tell Abdul as he will not take you for shopping. This is very unusual as guides tend to take you shopping. This is the difference between a professional guide and a \"shopping guide\". But when you ask Abdul for high quality Maroccan products he will take you to the right places or even offer you to buy you the spices at his home shop - which probably will cost 5 times less than what you will be ever able to bargain on the market ..."

He is responsive to his audience, spending more time going into depth when we were interested but moving on if he didn't capture our interest (although there was very little of what he had to offer that was not interesting, valuable and enthralling)!

I will say that I have always been a little hesitant on taking tours in general, but after experiencing it with Abdul, I can honestly say that it has CHANGED! Abdul is EXTREMELY informative not only in the area, the culture, and the way of life in Morroco. This HELPED a lot since I will honestly say that I was somewhat apprehensive being in Marrakech, at least initially. He explained that the houses are built with the inside of the house in mind, which then can make it SEEM as though the house is somewhat run down, at least from the outside. He also made sure that we saw what are the highlights of the area, but MADE sure that we would see what we wanted to see. He even was able to get a picture of my wife and I - she does not \"usually like\" having pictures taken of her. As stated in another review, he made it VERY easy for us to not only find our way around, but also with the local customs. Now on our other tour of the Atlas Mountains, he again was EXTREMELY informative about the area and also was able to arrange for us to have lunch in someone's house where he is converting part of it to a Riad. This not only made it quite comfortable, but also VERY welcomed since we were able to meet and interact with the \"local people\" and NOT with a typical tourist trap. He is great as a guide, I wish I could clone him and have him give us a tour in other parts of the world as we go and visit it. I know that if/when we go back and visit Marrakech, we would love to not only see Abdul again both on a personal and business level, I feel as though I have made a good friend \"half way around the world.!\""

In our party of 7 we had 3 children (2x15 and 1x12 year old) Abdul was very aware of their 'attention' span and adapted his tour perfectly. Abdul made several recommendations for restaurants and places to visit and we took his advise on all of them and we were not disappointed. We were able to ask him about local customs, tipping, bartering etc which gave us the confidence to 'go it alone'.

We decided on a walk through the Jewish Quarter since this was where our Riad was located. Then we proceeded throughout the Old City, taking in the Souks, Djemaa el-Fna, Koutoubia Minaret, and finally on to Ali Ben Youssef Madrasa and Museum. Being guided by Abdul was truly a relaxing experience as he knew the intricate narrow lanes of the Old City like the back of his hand. My husband and I had gotten lost numerous times on our own (trust me! even with a map the Old City is very difficult to navigate). Abdul is an extremely knowledgeable guide. He provided a very through introduction to the rich history of Marrakech. He patiently answered all of our questions and was happy to extend the tour when we asked for his assistance with a purchase.

When we first met Abdul, we were struck by how friendly, calm, warm and engaging he was. Abdul made a point of spending time clarifying exactly what we wanted to get out of our tour, which really helped to personalise our experience. I understand this is something that Abdul sees as being very important. Once he had a sense of our desires for the tour, it was very apparent that he made every effort to tailor it accordingly, which meant that we saw and did things that we found really interesting, vibrant and fun! For example, he helped us source a beautiful handmade leather pouffe for our home from a reputable merchant, took us to an awesome little restaurant for tangia for lunch, showed us around many beautiful historical sights including a museum, palace, the Katoubia Minerate, the many souks, and the main square. He also helped us to purchase some beautiful bitter orange oil which you can burn for the scent or use as a salad dressing! He was super knowledgable and passionate about Marrakech and was able to answer literally any question we had for him. He clearly loves what he does, and is good at it. Abdul is certified and professional - I understand there are some less reputable guides who are not certified - Abdul came highly recommended and we were very happy with our experience with him. Abdul was generous with his time and energy, and has great interpersonal skills. He also speaks fluent english which we found helpful. Abdul really helped us orientate ourselves in a city which can be quite overwhelming - the tour really helped us to feel confident in navigating the place ourselves in subsequent days, and helped us to feel excited about being in such a vibrant and interesting place! We could not recommend Abdul highly enough - you leave feeling like you would like to be friends with him! We went as a couple, but would recommend the tour for families, friends, solos - anyone really!"

I traveled to Marrakech for four days and spent three on tours with Abdul because I wanted to experience as much as I could in such a short time. I chose him because of tripadvisor reviews and his beautiful website. The first day Abdul came to the riad and we made a general plan that included the specific interests I had describe when I booked him: day to day life, music, richness of the culture, the beauty of the architecture. As the day unfolded, I discovered all of that plus the framework of history and the rhythm of a city whose attraction stems from historical sites spanning centuries, the high energy square and colorful souks, and the private backstreets that protect the intimacy of family and home. Each quarter of the city held surprises: a literary cafe that sponsors artists and poets and community events, an explanation of the door within a door on family homes, attention to the layers of materials used to construct buildings down through the centuries, a stop at the primary school Abdul attended as a kid, attention to the craftsmanship that it takes to create the beauty that surrounds you, a demonstration of making slow cooked lamb on the coals of the furnace that heats the hammam (expert multitasking), the caravanserais or fondouks in the old medina that that supported commerce on ancient trade routes and so much more. Then on to the souks to get a feel for the layout. There was no pressure to buy, but invaluable advice about specific things I was interested in getting later when I returned on my own. There was food to nibble, like dates and olives and pomegranates. And serious food-- the most delicious, tender lamb dinner in the world. That evening at the riad no one had similar tales to tell. All the words in previous reviews are true: comfortable, knowledgeable, engaging; it felt like we were being guided around with a friend. Book Abdul early in your stay in Marrakech, and you'll feel at ease in this magical city."

It felt like we were being shown around by a friend, which added to the authenticity of the tour, I highly recommend Abdul and his tours. You wont regret it."

For half a day Abdul charges 500 dirhams which is about \u00a345 to provide you with a tailor made tour. We wanted to see the old town and the museums with the advantage of having the history from a local and not a book. Abdul really knows his stuff and made the whole experience thoroughly enjoyable. We learnt so much and went to places we would never have thought of or knew about. He is also on hand for advice after the tour so it doesn't just end at the last stop in Jemna-el-fna. Abdul guided us through some Dars, the souks (briefly as you can spend hours there) and the museums. He provided us with restaurant and bar recommendations. Definitely worth every dirham!Full review on Large and Laughing."

One expects a licensed guide to be knowledgeable and one also hopes they are interesting. Abdul Razak is both but also adds an abundance of enthusiasm for his native city. It's great to see a local primary school, or bakery, but so much more engaging when this turns out to be where your guide went to school and his mother sent her bread to be baked, all in the very heart of the Medina! Shukran Abdul Razak, shukran!"

I travelled to Marrakech in June 2013 with my other half and we booked a half-day tour with Abdul on our very first day in the city. I cannot recommend this tour enough, especially at the start of your holiday so you feel confident in navigating the souks and with the culture. His English was excellent and he was a calm sort of guy- a good thing amongst busy Marrakech. As we were staying a bit outside the centre, we met Abdul outside the Mosque and it was easy to find him. He greeted us warmly and gave us a brief but interesting history of the area and was able to answer my questions. We then wandered through the Medina, having navigation tips explained to us as we went. He loves his city and seems very settled.We met locals, saw their daily routines, drank tea with them and learnt that it's ok to say 'no' in the souks when you don't want to do a deal! I probably would have found it unnerving to haggle but having a local with us, gave me the confidence to try it out before I did it on my own later in the holiday. At some points during the tour, I wanted to take photos of certain things and I looked to him to see if it was appropriate. He generally gave a reassuring nod of approval... as an ex art student, I'm a bit snap-happy but didn't want to cause anyone offence by photographing their shop fronts/family.We saw so much more than we ever would have found ourselves as he knew exactly where he was going. Lots of people knew him as we walked along, shaking his hand & saying hello - it was nice to watch! I cannot recommend booking this tour enough. Don't hesitate, just do it :)"

Abdul is certainly knowledgeable, and enjoys what he does. But I must admit I was fascinated by so much of what i see, I doubt I assimilate a quarter of the information Abdul was telling me. Even though it was the first day of Ramdan, and the heat was brutal, he tried to pack as much in as possible, which I appreciate. I also used a private tour guide later the next day recommended by my hotel who was cheaper (200 Dirhan for 3 hours), but perhaps not as seasoned nor knowledgeable as Abdul. would use Abdul again when I come back to Marrakech. Try not to go during the summer period, as it is HOT!"

You can explore the Medina on your own with a guide book but you will not learn or see as much as if you use a guide!After researching Guides on T/A I decided on Marrakech Guided Tours based on their excellent reviews and their rates. I contacted them and my emails were answered promptly. It helps if you have some idea of what you want to see during the tour depending on your interests. Otherwise they will put something together for you. You can do half or full day tours. As the working souks are closed on Fridays it is better to choose another day. Wear comfortable walking shoes.Our Guide, Abdul, met us at our Riad in the Medina at 9.30am as promised, for a half day walking tour. We learned all about the history of Marrakech as we walked through the alleyways of the Medina. As we walked he told us when each part of the Medina was built - he was born in the Medina and knows much about this fascinating part of Marrakech. The pace was leisurely and there was time for taking photos. We visited the bakery and watched the bread being baked. We visited the hammam, meeting the man who cooks the tangias for the locals. He is also a musician so he played some music for us. We took photos at each of these places - take your 20 dirham notes if you want photos. No money - no photos! We visited some of the working souks, the Medersa Ben Youssef and the Museum of Marrakech, which is close by. As we walked back to the Djemma el Fna through the souks with Abdul we realized how much knowledge he had shared with us during the tour, which ended at 1.00 pm. Abdul answered all our questions and took some photos for us. We could not have wished for a better Guide."

He takes pride in his work and loves to teach his clients as much as he can about the country, it's history and Marrrakech. Due to Ramadan and the heat, we did a half-day tour, and I can imagine it very hard for one to be fasting and guiding clients through the city in the middle of summer. Yet that didn't stop him. He brought up many interesting facts and historical references that led to many more follow-up questions. He is also very attentive to details. We asked questions we wouldnt have considered asking for we just wouldnt have known. This makes him a true exception unlike some other tripadvisor-recommended guides who say just a little more than that already captured on the Lonely Planet or on Wikipedia. If it weren't for Ramadan, I would have extended the trip to a full-day in a heart-beat."

After reading some of the previous reviews, my wife and I decided not to visit the Souks, and Abdul was very accommodating of this. On our way back to the main square we went through the Souks, but we had absolutely no pressure to buy anything from him. We thoroughly enjoyed the tour and felt like we got to understand part of the culture and history. It was the second day of Ramadan, and I got to hear more about Islam and what Ramadan means to the local people. It was a great way to experience the culture, rather than wandering around yourself (although getting lost can be fun too). Would have no hesitation to refer my friends or family visiting to Abdul."

A tailor made fun and historic filled three and a half hours. We paid a one off payment for the tour which was extremely reasonable and there was no 'carpet showroom' or 'silver factory' visits to be seen. I had let Abdul know roughly what we was after and he made sure he covered it all. We saw some great architecture and went through the winding souks in the medina and learnt a lot about the regular day to day lives of how moroccans conduct their business from baking bread, cooking in tangines (different pot shape to the tagine) and we went off the beaten track into the winding alleys and corridors of Marrakech. Abdul is extremely knowledgeable and has perfect ensglish and got the 'humour' of our group very quickly. Our time with Abdul went very quick and overall is a great intro into sightseeing in Marrakech. He will also tailor make/copy any package tour you could get from your travel agents and a much better cost. If I go back to Marrakech I will certainly look Abdul up and organise another trip or two with him as there is so much to see and do. Abdul looks after you with care and tenacity and made sure we had a taxi back to the hotel and we never felt worried or stranded. We went on our tour at 9:30am whilst it was still fairly cool. Many places to stop for water and comfy shoes a must. Please try Abdul as I cannot express how comfortable he made us all feel and he has a very good sense of humour too. Thank you Abdul, you were a mjaor part of our holiday as we then visited some of the places for longer rather than pay Thomas cook or First choice fees which aredouble if you DIY."

We spent a day together which is difficult to put into words, we covered many of the main sights in this beautiful and historical city, but more than that, we learnt so much about the history, culture and daily lives of the people here. We met a community baker, hammam fire stoker and musician, local school teacher and young students, some of the best stall owners in the souks (no pressure to buy anything, just helpful advice on who to see for the best quality things we wanted), fantastic restaurant where even the King himself has eaten, but is so reasonable that the locals eat there everyday, plus as mentioned, sights such as Koutoubia Mosque, Majorelle Gardens, Ben Yousseft Madrasa, Marrakech Museum and many more. Abdul is such a generous, knowledgeable, kind and sincere man with such a deep understanding and love of this city and the people here. Having lived here all his life he knows every part of Marrakech intimately.

We did not know much about it but got on TripAdvisor to see who had better ratings for tours. We saw that Abdul was highly rated and many people recommended his tours. We booked a half day tour with him and could not have been more pleased. Abdul showed us more than we ever could have expected, taught us how to shop in the souks, explained the history of Marrakech and even took us to where he went to school as a little boy. We really felt like he took good care of us and what we got out of it was way more than what we paid. Throughout our next couple of days we would run into him and he always came by to say hello and make sure that we were OK and having a good time. Like our daughter would say he was totally \"awesome\". We would highly recommend him to anyone travelling to Marrakech."

He met us at Koutoubia and spent 4hrs showing round his home town including the back streets and giving us recommendations for the rest of our holiday. We then wanted a trip to Ourika Valley and the Atlas mountains so we contacted Abdul whilst in Marrakech who sent us his friend Moha to take us out all day in his 4x4. We went for tea in a Berber house and climbed up to see some beautiful waterfalls and had the best tagine ever!Thanks to both Abdul and Moha for a wonderful time - would definitely recommend them to anyone!"

From the 1st email conversation I knew that Abdul was going to be the perfect guide. He grew up a few metres away from the Riad where we were staying, so we had some great images of growing up in the area from the very first minute. We were taken to a local baker and ate fresh bread and pizza straight from the oven. We were given an impromptu concert from the boiler man for the hammam ( after stoking the fire, he played a few songs for us.) Abdul was able to show us Inside Marrakech and also showed us the sights that I asked to be included in our itinerary (museum of marrakech and the Koran school) This was the best way to be introduced to Marrakech and as this was in the afternoon of our arrival, we didn't even have Moroccan dirhams at the time, Abdul was very generous and paid entrance fees until we were able to get to an ATM. If you are looking for genuine Marrakech with a genuinely honest and knowledgeable guide, then look no further, Abdul IS your man. Many thanks Abdul, hopefully we will meet again someday. J & S"

In setting the course for the half day afternoon tour, Abdul was able to guide us to many historical sites, to provide an in-depth knowledge of history and culture and to provide a good insight on key ways to navigate the busy streets and to find the best local cuisine. Abdul was fantastic with my children and kept them engaged over an afternoon of history and culture. This is quite a challenge; however, Abdul passed with flying colors!Highly recommended!"

It was a day well spent in his company, exploring the entire Medina following in the footprints of history. At first I thought that a full day tour would be too much for my 2 teenage nephews and my 2 young adult daughters, but he captured all our attention with his knowledge and passion for Marrakech. He opened our eyes to a culture so interesting and beautiful and made our tour a fun learning experience. Before the tour began, he asked us what we wanted to see and gave us a brief summary of what we could expect for the next 7 hours. Surprisingly, time just flew by so quickly. I loved the fact that knew how to capture the attention of all 4 kids and made sure they were engaged and participated in our conversations!We walked into the oldest part of the Medina and visited with the local baker, was entertained by the hammam water heater/tangia cook, saw artisans working their crafts and he even recommended the best restaurant for Roast Lamb right smack in the middle of the Souk! We wanted Shawarma for lunch and he took us to a pretty good place (kids went back the next day!) He also treated us to his son's favorite cookie as we wandered through the streets of his old neighborhood! Abdul is a Superb Tour Guide - with his excellent command of English and remarkable knowledge of Marrakech, its History and Culture comes to life as he walks you through the tiny cobbled streets of the Medina.Email Abdul and Book the Full Day Tour - it will be a day well spent!"

On arrival at our Riad - Abdul stood calmly outside for ten minutes after having knocked several times, we couldnt get out as the key wasnt in the door! Very relieved that he chose to stay as without him as our guide we wouldnt have experienced the school he grew up in where all the toddlers were very excited to see \"foreigners! We loved the bakery, the fearless man heating the water for the hammam, the stalks on the royal gates, the spices, the Moroccan Banksy and many many more sights and smells. Abdul is clearly a well educated man who exudes his passion for his country very naturally and honestly. I advise all travellers to Marrakesh who are a little bit scared ( Aileen...) to book Abdul, we left the country wanting to come back and see more. Thanks Abdul for a great day"

Simply follow, listen and enjoy the tour. He will pick you up and drop you off anywhere you like. Abdul was a delight to follow around the busy lanes of the souks. He was very knowledgable, spoke excellent English, was very accommodating and had an air of calm and tranquillity. The highlight of our tour was walking through the handi-work/manufacturing area and seeing the locals sitting on the floor hand-making all of their merchandise. We would have certainly not of found this area without him. Before the tour we were often hesitant to go through certain areas on our own but with Abdul we felt very safe to explore all of the previously daunting lanes. Book the tour with Abdul as soon as you can, because he is in great demand. I would also recommend that if you would like to shop for something in particular book Abdul, he will take you to the best places and make sure you get a fair price. We will definitely book Abdul again if we return to Marrakech. Couldn\u2019t recommend Marrakech guided day tours highly enough."

So are you looking for a guid we really recommand him!For those who doubt whether or not to take a guide to explore Marrakech we can say: you will learn a lot and after your tour you have a lot of new information!! Abdul knows a lot of things we didn't find in our travelling books (we always prepare and read a lot before travelling to a country/city).We did a half day tour with our children (age 8 and 10). They don't speak English so we had to translate for them. In the beginning we had to ask Abdul to stop giving more information so that we could translate for the children but after a while Abdul saw when we needed to translate and gave us time to do it (this is very important because the children get bored if they have to wait for a long time for new information)For our children a half day was enough and they liked it very much and also learned a lot. For them it was very important that Abdul had also answers to their (child)questions !Just a small tip for improvement: we didn't realise we needed some small money to tip some people (for example the man of the backery). It would be better to mention this before."

He was always very fast to reply to emails, and tailored the day exactly to what we wanted to do.He met us at our Riad and helped us with how to pin point our street amongst the winding roads. On the walk to the main square, he kept stoping to point out directions and different routes so that we wouldn't get lost. This in itself made the whole place so much less daunting and a whole lot more comfortable and safe! I would say to have this information and to feel so welcomed on your first day is priceless and definitely worth the money for the tour.AbdulRazzaq was very knowledgeable of the city, having lived in the old city through his childhood, which we later got to see. He took us to the hammam where the coals were warmed and we were met with amazing musical entertainment and mint tea when we got to meet the coal burner up close and personally. This moment alone was worth the tour- absolute once in a life time opportunity which a normal \"tourist\" probably won't get to see easily. Following this we also go to see the bakery and how the locals have their bread baked.We must have seen everything there was to see just in this one day, so had a really good idea of what we wanted to spend more time on in the following days.The best part of the tour is getting close to the locals, and really choosing what you wish to see.Definitely recommend to all."

            "review": "Genuine, ethical, knowledgeable: Perfect guide for crazy city. We actually just finished the last 2 days with Abdul and are still in Marrakech. He was such a fantastic guide that I needed to write this review as it was still fresh in my head. First, we are a family of 3 which includes a rambunctious 4 year old. Abdul was a breath of fresh air in a city that will completely disorientate you and was a calming influence. The things that I expect from a guide were completely blown away by Abdul. He always looked out for our best interests, he entertained our 4 year old, he made sure that vendors were being genuine, showed us activities that no one else can show you on a mega tour, his knowledge base is amazing and no question was left unanswered. His love for his country completely shines through -- while he obviously made this a career you can still see his genuine appreciation for showing us his country and enthusiasm.We booked 2 tours;1. Full day tour -- lasts about 8 hours -- he showed us all the major sites -- he let us contour or tailor the tour with our interests during the entire day. For example, I needed a US travel adapter because our hotel did not have one that worked and Abdul helped me find one, it was rather cold weather here and he helped my wife find a shawl -- some private guides have a set agenda that they follow and that's it -- not Abdul. He constantly said that he would like to how us this if its okay or we can tell him something different. He always was looking out for my son -- talking to him, racing with him -- genuine and sincere acts as I can easily spot people who are faking it. He is a guide that is independent -- no kick backs, referrals, or commissions with anyone -- for eating we wanted something genuine whether it was street food or restaurant. He had thought about me, a vegetarian, my picky 4 year old, and my carnivorous wife -- he picked the best food. Abdul makes you feel comfortable because you're not going to know how to negotiate, not know the language, how much to tip... For example, many times he would argue with the locals when he felt they were overcharging me, or he felt that the tip was too much -- who does that? If you truly want someone on your side then he is your guide. Let me say this, whatever you want to see he will show you with confidence or he will show you what he thinks is important -- complete personal tour. I wanted activities for my son -- delivered with restroom Breaks, ice cream shops, camel rides, monkeys, snakes, looking at different animals....2. Essaouira day tour -- amazing tour. I wanted to spend an hour on the beach so my son could play and Abdul said no problem. He made sure that we saw everything in a concise fashion and we were able to make my son happy. No one else would allow this much contouring. One last example: my son wanted to ride the camel on the beach and Abdul had a heated conversation with the owner as he wanted to charge us 300 MAD and Abdul said that was a total scam And he brought it down to 100 MAD. Abdul is passionate about being ethical as does not like it when locals try to overcharge or scam others. Look at his pricing for the tours -- it's well below especially in what he delivers.Basically, if you want someone who will tell you the ins and outs of Marrakech, make you feel you have a friend in the city, makes sure you are not being taken advantage of, can easily handle children as little as mine, please book Abdul early. You will not make a better choice and your vacations will be so much better.April 27 and 28th -- tours with Abdul"

Abdul came to our Riad and together we planned our day. Having ventured out by ourselves the day before, getting hopelessly lost and at the mercy of unscrupulous 'helpful' guides, we could not have made a better decision or choice when opting for the full day tour with Abdul. We took it at a pace to suit ourselves, I have mobility issues, which Abdul took in to account on our trip at all times. He is a courteous, intelligent, well-informed and friendly man who, by the end of our amazing day together, we felt as if we'd known for years! He took us on a wonderful tour of the hidden treasures of Marrakech, which definitely needed extensive local knowledge to find and access. Lunch was a truely Moroccan 'foody' experience, delicious and a meal never to forget. Abdul also arranged a trip in to The Atlas Mountains with his associate Mohan--another brilliant day with a another lovely young man and excellent tour guide. Our Mitsubushi vehicle was comfortable and very easy for me to access. We visited a Berber House for tea and again ate lunch in an unforgettable place.Both trips were great value for money. We saved time and energy because we knew exactly where we were going and became much more knowledgable about Marrakech , the place and its people. It is difficult to describe how lost one can get in the souks especially. For us a guide was essential, and a bonus was to have met the best two guides possible.Many thanks again chaps.

I agree with Elaine K on a previous thread.Abdul will help you appreciate this great city at a better level, the babs, souk's, medina and all the attractions the city has to offer. I cant recommend Abdul enough, you wont regret it. Another positive is that it will help you get your bearings in a chaotic city, which will boost your confidence to tour the city in your own time and interact with the locals and their customs.As a keen photographer i got to take pictures i would never have access to if i hadn't toured with Abdul - like the local baker and the guy who heats the local baths."

Abdul's services came very highly recommended and I'm so glad we followed good advice. Abdul is charming and friendly , knowledeable and extremely helpful. He is concerned to help you orientate yourself and to get the very best out of his city. He will make sure you see the things, which would otherwise pass you by and he leaves your feeling that bit more confident in finding your way around and happy that you've seen snatches of the 'real' Marrakesh.His services can extend beyond the hours of the tour (within reason ,of course!) We found ourselves texting for restaurant recommnedations 2 days later and he was more than happy to help. Indeed, I feel if we'd got really stuck, he would have tried to help. You feel that you're buying yourself a little bit more more than an individually tailored city tour.Don't hesitate."

            "review": "Excellent, flexible and individually tailored service. Based on TA reviews, we booked Abdul for a half day orientation of the city and a full day trip into the Atlas Mountains. The two experiences, obviously, were very different, but Abdul's wide ranging knowledge, sensitivity to our needs, useful advice and unfailing charm and good humour were common to both. The half day tour is highly recommended as early as possible in your stay as it provides a first-rate introduction to the city: we walked for about four hours at a leisurely pace through an intelligently planned itinerary which introduced us to so much about the city: its structure and the rationale behind it, the nature of a riad, the way of life, the commerce [in the legendary souks], bread baking customs, hammams, the Medersa, historial buildings.. and much more. As others have said, Abdul invites you to specify your areas of interest, and he will tailor your tour to suit.Our second trip was a day out in the High Atlas Mountains - again specially tailored for softies like us - though a more physically strenuous version was offered had we wanted it! We drove in a very comfortable Land Cruiser which cushioned the rugged off road trail we took in order to see more of the fabulous countryside and views. In Imlil, we had been offered the choice of a smart hotel lunch or home cooked food in a Berber house - we chose the latter and the hospitality, the tea tasting ceremony and the excellent food were all perfect. Definitely the right choice! A post lunch walk through chestnut, cherry and olive groves was fine for us - though a longer walk up the mountain was also offered. Throughout the day, we enjoyed chatting to Abdul about a wide range of aspects of Moroccan life and culture (and, indeed, English: he has a degree in English Language & Literature!) - he is immensely knowledgeable. The service provided by Abdul is first rate, flexible and we would highly recommend him: I cannot imagine anyone doing a better job."

They returned full of high praise and said we should opt for the full day tour. Abdul was efficient, helpful and wonderful to spend time with. We particularly loved the fact he asked us what we could choose to do for the tour. We said we wanted a mixture of culture, food and atmosphere. Not only did he deliver this he excelled!Abdul is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the city and his guides. We saw the most incredible buildings and met the most wonderful people. It was like we were walking around in a bubble that you never wanted to burst. The day set us up perfectly for the rest of our week. The advise never stopped, we asked about restaurants, what else we should go and see, reasonable costs for taxis, where not to go. If you are looking to learn, love and live Marrakech book with Abdul."

After a slightly inauspicious start (we gave him the wrong address), Abdul showed himself to be an excellent guide- knowledgeable, interesting to listen to, patient and willing to discuss all the subjects and questions we directed towards him. He had an excellent command of the English language and showed a breadth and depth of knowledge about the city and its past. We ambled around the city seeing and discussing numerous interesting sights and had the opportunity to go to some places we would never have found or tried by ourselves. To be honest it felt more like walking around with a knowledgeable friend than a guide. His relaxed pace and style gave a unique contrast to the hectic pace of the city and I was amazed how we could just stand and chat about something whilst the city buzzed around us. He will pay attention to where you want to go and where you have already been, give good advice about how to buy and who to buy from (if you ask) and take you to great places to eat and drink, again, according to your needs. Although we had already spent a day looking around Marrakech our full day with Abdul built on that easily and gave us a different perspective. Invaluable. In fact, we dubbed him the Obi-Wan of Marrakech!P.S. The negative reviews for Marrakech guided day tours do not match our experience at all. In fact, one that looks like it is from a Londoner has very poor use of English and all the other reviews from that reviewer are from the same day with single word comments. They look like false reviews -treat with caution."

A new place to visit can seem worrying or unnerving meaning people miss out of some amazing things. From the very beginning our guide made us feel comfortable and safe offering reassurance and light hearten dialogue.Historical to geographical, religious to numerous, There was nothing our guide Abdul was not able to express. We were shown food production, riads, markets and restaurants. I particularly liked Abdul's approach offering choices and allowing our family to plan what we wanted to do during the trip, making sure we didn't miss anything. Some guides have told us what we are to do and where we must go, but with Abdul, we were able to spend a day seeing all there was to see, with a smile on our faces and a relaxed yet safe feeling to the day. All the we were promised was delivered from the peace and tranquility that the riad offered, to the satisfaction we got from interacting with the market traders, knowing our guide was not far away if we needed him. I think we asked a hundred questions, all of which received a smile and logical answer. Rarely have I felt so calm and content in such a busy place, thank you so much Abdul for making our families trip so amazing. So in my opinion, if you want to speak to someone who knows all there is about this beautiful town and country, and can help you to see and do all you could wish for...look no further than speaking with the person we had the pleasure of meeting, Abdul.Thank you so much and \"Our hearts remain frozen from all we have seen\". (I'm sure he will explain this to you).Best wishesChris and Sue Bricknell-Sproston"

Abdul is extremely knowledgeable about a city you can see he deeply loves. Abdul came exactly on time, listened first to what we were interested in and then catered the tour to what we said. We were interested in exploring more \"off the beaten track\" Marrakech. Abdul took us to a local market first and then through the Souks. We were able to see how a community within the City lives. I.e. Where the typical Moroccan bread is baked and the nursery. Abdul then explained to us the type of houses (Riads and a Dar) and how the homes are built for privacy. He was able to answer all our questions. We were taken around Ben Youssef and Abdul explained in great detail the history of the buildings architecture and uses. He then took us to explore deep into the Souks, explaining how to best examine the quality the things for sales (i.e. tea pots). I could not recommend Abdul enough. He was gracious, intelligent and very much in tune with what we were interested in. We felt confident to continue exploring this beautiful city on our own after this tour!"

My wife and I have visited many cities over the years and experienced some good and average guides, I would rate Abdul and his Marrakech Guide Day Tours the best we have ever had. Abdul arrived at our Riad on time and smartly dressed, his personality very welcoming but also extremely professional. Abdul asked us what we would like to see and experience, however as there is so much going on that we opted for a sample of everything, which is exactly what Abdul delivered. Abdul guided us through the south of the Medina, visiting various places of interest whilst explaining how the different quarters began. We then traversed up through the Souks to a lovely Riad for lunch, after lunch we continued through the north finally ariving at the main square at 5.30pm.....a full day for an excellent price. If your going to Marrakech I would highly recommend booking a day tour with Abdul, at all times we felt safe and got no hassle from street sellers, nor did Abdul take us to any of his 'friends' souks for good price gifts. Thank you Abdul for an excellent day."

I realised with such a large group, that some planning for our 4 day visit would be needed to ensure everyone got the most from the trip.

Abdul picked us up from our Riad and walked us to the historical and cultural highlights, explaining all the way in perfect English, with a resident's knowledge and great humour, all the details of Marrakesh life. He was extremely charming and courteous at all times. As he was already booked for the Monday, he arranged for a colleague, Ben, to take us to the Atlas mountains. Abdul arranged the transport and fantastic lunch at a Berber house for all 13 of us. Abdul himself came to the Riad to introduce Ben and ensure that all the arrangements with the bus etc were just perfect. Ben spoke excellent English too and gave us a fabulous day. Most of the party climbed and walked through the villages, I found I couldn't manage, so a mule was whistled up for me which was amazing. All our party said the High Atlas trip was a real highlight. We were welcomed by all the people we met and felt we got a real flavour of this part of Morrocco. Many thanks Abdul for all your organisation."

We didn\u2019t want a cultural tour of the palaces and museums as we were confident that we could take in as much as we wanted to by exploring these ourselves. We told him that instead we wanted to meet the local people and craftsman, not just the places accessible and discoverable by an inquisitive tourist. We had intended on booking him for a full day to accomplish this, he very kindly explained that it was not necessary to book him for the full day as a half day was enough for him to show us around and allow us to orientate ourselves. We booked him for the afternoon of our first full day in Marrakech and also booked him for a full day to see the Atlas mountains the day after. Abdul arrived at our riad at 2.30 and we had a quick discussion to confirm our preferences. He first took us the best way to reach Jemaa el Fna square through a busy alley buzzing with locals on foot, donkeys and mopeds. When we reached the square the heavens opened and we sheltered for about ten minutes under the cover of an orange sellers stall until the rain eased and we could continue. After explaining the important landmarks in and around the square he led us through some increasingly quieter alleyways to the northern area of the Medina where the most beautiful riads are to be found. We stopped in a lovely riad for drinks of fresh almond and orange juices. A few minutes later we were deep in the heart of the souks where tourists were very sparse. He managed to perfectly balance his observations for us with quiet times to let us take it all in. He stopped a street vendor to buy a bundle of sketchbooks and then took us to a local primary school to meet a teacher and her class. Kristi had said that she wanted to see a public bakery and he took us to one that I defy anyone to find on their own, it was tucked away, tiny and magical. As was the next stop to meet the men who keep the fires going for one of the public hamams. They made mint tea for us and one of them sang a song whilst playing some strange stringed instrument, wonderful characters, kind, gentle and very funny. We finished our tour back at the square as we had requested so that we could experience the bustle in the early evening. The following day Abdul and his driver picked us up in a 4-wheel drive to go to a village in the Atlas Mountains. On the way it was very cloudy and as we got higher it was either very foggy or we were in dense cloud, visibility was about 20 feet but the driver was very safe. Abdul remained cheerful and confident saying that it would clear soon. We stopped for mint tea with a local Berber family before continuing through the mist. Finally it cleared and travelled through beautiful valleys of fruit and walnut trees before reaching our destination. Abdul gave us the option of taking lunch at the Kasbah Du Toubkal or to visit a family in a Berber village, we opted for the latter and reached the house after a short trek. We were greeted by a Berber called Lahcen who led us to his balcony overlooking Mount Toubkal. He brought us dates and almonds and encouraged us to make mint tea under his guidance. After a tour of his house (which he hopes to make into a guest house called Imlil Authentic Toubkal Lodge later this year), Lahcen brought us the most incredible lunch of Moroccan salad, a superb and authentic lamb tagine with preserved lemons, onions and prunes and a couscous and vegetable tagine which we all shared. Abdul had already explained that a 400 Dirham contribution for the meal would be ample but we tipped an extra 100. It was easily the best food that we had on our holiday. After saying our thanks and goodbyes we elected the \u201cmedium\u201d length walk to see the Kasbah and were astonished to be greeted by Lahcen who had taken a short cut to his second job! After a drink we made our way back to Marrakech and the riad. We said our thanks and goodbyes to Abdul, a warm and gentle man without who our experience in Marrakech would not have been the same. I must say that we travel widely and often but very rarely take any sort of a tour. Abdul absolutely made our holiday in Marrakech and we thoroughly recommend him, we saw things that we would never had without his local knowledge. On a final note, he never, ever, gave any hint that we should visit any shops or buy from traders and I would view any comments to the contrary with great scepticism."

It was so nice seeing Marrakech with a guide, Abdul knew so much about the city and guided us around the souks, the medina and the derbs, all while giving us the history of the city. While walking through the souks, one of the shopkeepers tried to get us in, but Abdul very kindly told him were weren't interested, which was such a relief as the shopkeepers can be VERY persuasive. At no time did we feel he was taking us to any shops, which was good as we just wanted to walk through. At the end of our tour, Abdul very kindly said we could contact him should we have any further questions - which I thought was such a friendly gesture. I would without hesistation use Abdul again for another tour if I head back to Morocco, and also recommmend his Guided Tours to friends and family.

My only criticism is that during the very last part of the tour, which was in the Souks, he was walking a bit ahead of us and not really saying much.

He collected us from our hotel was a little late but apologised profusely through out the tour. His knowledge of the city, the country and the history was without fault. He spoke very good English and nothing was a problem for him. We have no hesitation in recommending him for an enjoyable and informative tour."

He was both knowledgeable and passionate about Marrakech and provided an insight into Marrakech that we wouldn't have been able to discover on our own. His English is refined and his manner is friendly and relaxed. We found this so much better than having trail round in a large tour group. He let us know which places would be better to visit on our own after the tour such as the gardens and museums to allow us to make the most of the time with him. One thing to note is that Abdul is clearly in demand as for the last part of the tour when we were wandering through the souk he picked up a number of calls on his phone (maybe sorting other tours?) which was a bit frustrating when we paid for his time. Nevertheless, this is a minor point of what was overall a great tour."

We booked Abdul for a full day tour of Marrakech as we didn't want to be in a large tour group and really wanted to get away from the usual tourist route. So pleased we decided to go with Adul as he totally tailor made the trip to what we wanted to do.We visited the Palace, Saadian tombs, Ben Youseff and Museum and more interestingly for me the jewish quarter, spice markets and souks. It was my second time in Marrakech and I loved seeing parts of it I just wouldn't of without Abdul. I think the most interesting part of the tour was having coffee and simply discussing the culture, it was fascinating to have an open and honest conversation about the traditions and about aspects of the culture you would normally never have a chance to discuss. I feel I have come away with a better understanding of the Muslim religion and culture, and one that you simply wouldn't get doing a tour through a hotel rep or in a large group.I would thoughrally reccommend doing a tour with Abdul - I would also say do the full day as you will see so much more and is 100% worth the money - you won;t regret it and will learn and see so much"

Abdul has a laid back nature, and is charming and engaged us throughout the tour. We felt at ease and did not feel rushed at any point. We were able to talk extensively about food, past and present culture of Morrocan people, religion and politics.The tour is typically 7 hours long, but the walking pace was very manageable. We visited the Tombs, Palace, Museum, Jewish quarter, Souks for spices, the university, botantical garden and also visited a local Hammas and bakery. Abdul is very willing to take pictures of our experiences on the trip, which was great. The photos were good too.We ate a local lunch of Beef Tagina and clay baked lamb. At my request we also visited a local patisserie for traditional treats.It is possible to ask to include an authentic lunch at the local Hammas, and to also attend the local Hammas. Ask!We did have to pay for a taxi, all entry fees and lunch - in all no more than 240dhrs. I felt I had been educated well in understanding a snapshot of Marrakech past and present, its communities and way of life. I saw everything I wanted to, and all at my pace. Thank you very much Abdul for a most enjoyable tour, we wish you well.Manda and Paul"

Khalid was also prompt and courteous in his reply and we set up our tour after he gave me a tentative schedule. He offered to alter the tour to meet my needs and gave me suggestions. Khalid arrived at our Riad on time and was very polite and accommodating. I love to take photos (lots of photos) and Khalid was very patient and helpful to inform me of when and when not to bring out my camera. He took us to meet several important people in the town such as the town baker. He had several friends who were skilled craftsmen who allowed us to watch and photograph them making lanterns. Our tour was very interesting and educational on the life and history of Marrakech. I highly recommend Khalid Amor as a guide."

Marrakech is a vibrant, bustling city with endless windy roads and alleyways and surprises hidden behind every corner. But to some tourists it can be perceived as daunting and even a little threatening. We travelled with a tour operator but didn\u2019t really fancy their standard tours with around 30 people, attracting negative attention wherever they go. We wanted to see the real Marrakech, learn about the history and the way of life.So, after doing some research we settled on Marrakech Guided Tours. I contacted them and had a very swift response from a guide called Abdul, who was very polite and helpful and even arranged to meet us at our hotel. Abdul arrived on time and was very polite and spoke excellent English.We started our tour at the Koutoubia Mosque and Minaret where we were given a fascinating lecture on its history and the history of Marrakech. You can specify what you want to do and see, but we just wanted a general introduction to the city and advised Abdul to show us what he felt was significant.We made our way through streets full of locals and learned all about the history, architecture and the culture \u2013 even stopping at a local school and bakery. We visited a museum and the former university (costs extra), then we visited the Caf\u00e9 de Epices where we sat and enjoyed the views other a smaller market square.The whole time Abdul was friendly, helpful, polite and informative. When we pressed him for recommendations of where to buy things, he was reluctant to advise, a sign that he was trustworthy, but did provide some useful tips on where the locals shop. He offered to take pictures of the two of us, which was really nice, as I'm not very good with a camera it means there are usually more pictures of me than my girlfriend. Abdul spent several hours with us and even arranged a taxi for us to go back to the hotel (at an extra cost of about \u00a312 - evening rates)."

I tried, in vain to book a last minute tour with Abdul from Marrakech Guided Day Tours (I emailed on the Wednesday for a Saturday tour!). Abdul was already booked for that day, but fortunately he put me in contact with Khalid Amor, another Marrakech Guided Day Tours guide who (as well as being great friends with him) was a colleague of Abdul's. Fortunately for us this proved to be a most auspicious recommendation! Khalid promptly emailed me back to let me know that he was available to take us on a guided tour of the Medina. Khalid arrived promptly at our wonderful Palais Sebban and we discussed where we would like to go for the day....we just asked him to show us the real Marrakech...map out, we were on our way. To say this was a superb day would be an understatement. Khalid was superb - showing us all those places that would normally be inaccessible to a weekend tourist. We visited a locals' fruit market which was tucked down some winding alleys which was fabulous - Khalid treated us to some just picked oranges which were much appreciated (we were walking miles!). We visited everywhere from the backstreet artisan courtyards to the leather auction, from the metalwork district to the stunningly beautiful Bahia Palace, from the winding streets of the Jewish quarter to the atmospheric and mind-blowing souks. One of the most enjoyable parts of the day was sharing lunch with Khalid in his 'local' cafe in the souk - fantastic kebabs, chickpeas and lentil broth - stunning food with amazing company. Khalid made what was a fabulous long weekend in Marrakech even more special - he even arrived at our hotel on the Sunday with a birthday present for me which was so heartwarming. If you want to see the real Marrakech with a real gentleman with a passion for his home town and country and a wealth of knowledge - please look no further thank booking with this fantastic pair of guides. (We bumped into Abdul twice which was an absolute pleasure - he greeted us like old friends - and it was clear that he and Khalid were kindred spirits with a passion for their work). Khalid spent from 9am-4pm on that Saturday and we felt like we were saying goodbye to an old friend when he left. We will certainly be back and we will certainly be booking another tour! Money well spent and highly recommended."

Having been living in Marrakech all his life Abdul has a huge knowledge about this ancient city and was always willing to share it with us in excellent english.The tour into the Atlas was an even greater experience being topped by a lunch meal in a private home with excellent views to the mountains.

It's easy to get lost in Marrakesh and our riad was south of the medina and though beautiful once we were through the front door, it was situated in what looked as though in was not in the best of areas. Abdul met us at our riad at 9.30 as arranged, and showed us the best way to reach the Jemma El Fnaa square which is the heart of Marrakesh. We needn't have worried, it was all quite straightforward once we knew.Abdul will tailor your tour to your particular interest. Whilst we were interested to find out lots about Marrakesh, we are particular interested in the food. Abdul took us to a bakery and showed us where all the local women take their bread to be baked - it was amazing to see all the very similar loaves that had been/were waiting to be baked - the baker knew whose was whose though the looked the same to us!He showed us a boiler room for one of the hammams where a man was continually stoking a fire with wood shavings which was heating the water. Local people brought their tangias (cooking pots - not tagines), a Morrocan dish containing meat and vegetables which he cooked for hours in the resulting ash from the ovens. The man then kindly played us a little Morrocan music on an instrument we have never seen before! Both these visits were particularly interesting and we would never have seen these without Abdul. He also took us around the souks - pointed out the spices, the sheeps heads (we passed on them), talked about the herbs and other dishes, dried fruits, the stalls that spring up in the square every evening cooking all sorts of food etc. as well us showing us some of the Marrakesh architecture and talking about the Muslim faith and the mosques and general way of life for Morrocans.We would recommend Abdul - especially if it is your first visit to Marrakesh!"

The following day, Abdel took us through the maze that is the old city of Marrakech and introduced us to it's colorful history as well as showing us glimpses into the daily life of the Marrakech people. Try the streetfood - broadbean soup in the morning and sardines for lunch, Yum!Abdel, I truly appreciated your patience with our often silly questions, and the way we never seemed rushed even when we took last minute detours from the planned route. Your honesty shone through, if you didn't have the answer (which happened maybe twice) there was no long winded excuse or rubbish story. You promised to show us artisans without us being bombarded by them trying to sell us everything, and you kept that promise. But most importantly and impressive, was your knowledge of your city and it's rich and vibrant history which was entertaining as well as eye opening.

After the tour, we were readily able to navigate on our own, and comfortable going anywhere. He was full of advice about what to do during our stay. He was willing to stop where we wanted and take as much time as we needed. Explanations were complete and clear; he is easy to talk to. Unlike other guides, he never steered us to any merchant or store; in fact, he took pains to avoid favoring any.The only problem with Abdul, as he told us, is that his reputation as a guide is becoming so strong that he may be 100% obligated during busy times. This is a good problem to have: book early -- and you won't be disappointed."

He is a great speaker: his love for his country and city is in every single word and makes you understand what surrounds you, so far from what you know and live in your own country."

Also he arranged a 1 day trip to the Oureka Valley with a 4wheeldrive and a SAFE DRIVER, that was very important for us. Both trips Abdul communicates with care and love for his clients to compose a interesting and nice programm for everyone. Abdul speaks English very well (much more better than mine ;-) and it is very nice to hear all the stories about HIS city: Marakech! I can strictly recommend Abdul as your guide, Abdul is warm, well educated, serious, very integer, wise and flexible with all the wishes /ideas of the group. Greetzzzz, Fleur Fleuren + 3 childeren (from Holland)!"

After earlier excellent reviews I booked Abdul for a half day tour on the 26th December. Abdul asked what our interests were by mail and we indicated we would be most interested by seeing the craftsmen of the souks at work and seeing how they lived their lives. Abdul began his tour with a little bit of the history of the establishment of Marrakech a thousand years ago, then illustrated how this history has shaped how the city and souks, and neighbourhoods were constructed. We saw a leather hide market, metal workers at work, shoe makers and the communal bakeries. All done attentively listening to us and our thoughts and giving us his personal insights into his city. Marrakech is confusing, noisy and shocking in parts to the Western eye, but Abdul made us feel safe and there was no time wasted getting lost in the souks or trying to avoid the guys who hassle you to buy their wares or services. I would recommend Abdul without hesitation. Thanks again!"

Abdul was the perfect guide - sensing when my young daughter was tired and stopping appropriately. Whilst, like others in his trade he cajoles tourists to \"favourite\" destinations, it never felt forced or false - rather it was his good judgement. He will generate a bespoke tour as you require with an enthusiasm and passion to be marvelled at.In summary: Go for it!"

Over the years, we have travelled extensively and enjoyed getting to know the people and places we visit. Not being fluent in French or Arabic, I chose to engage a knowledgeable local english speaking guide to help us. Upon reading the reviews, I engaged Abdul to show us his city. It proved to be the best decision I made. He is an intelligent, courteous and attentive guide who knows much about the city\u2019s people and but how Morocco has evolved. He patiently answered our questions and gave us a better understanding of the daily lives of the people. Besides all the \u2018must see\u2019 tourist places, Abdul showed us sights that we would have missed. So we were able to relate everyday activities with what we had learned. We passed through myriads of passages, old and new, encountered local markets and caught glimpses of craftsmen focused on their work.We began our tour in the southern part of the Medina, walked to the Kasbah and onto the Mellah. We meandered towards the Medersa and through souks until we finally reached Jemaa el Fna. Having soaked up the atmosphere there, we took a caleche and rode to Jardin Marjorelle. The garden was a delightfully tranquil place and a lovely way to end our day with Abdul.Watching Abdul interacting with his countrymen showed us how one should behave. We were never harried by unsolicited sellers or unnecessary distractions. He was punctual and as I had arranged, met us at our hotel on the edge of the Palmeraie. Thank you Abdul for making it a most enjoyable experience for my son and I."

Let me start with the conclusion: after a whole day guided tour with Abdul you're really ready to conquer this wonderful city all by your own. The method? Walking around with Abdul in Mellah, Kasbah, Mouassine and other of the colourful but not so touristic quarters of Marrakech while you listen to his intelligent and knowledgeable presentation of what you are seeing you step by step understands the city, the atmosphere and its people. When you're witnessing Abdul's polite and respectful greetings of the tradesmen in the souks you understand that the sometimes agressive rejection that you were ready to show towards eager Morrocans is not the right way. Show people respect and they will respect you. This attitude that we learnt by Abdul we tried to perform the rest of our holiday and it worked. So besides all the factual information you get from Abdul you also get a peep into the soul of Marrakech and its people."

There were so many things on my \"must-see\" list and I only had 2 days to see it. I started reading about guides when I came across Abdul Aissaoui Marrakech Guided Tours and immediately checked to see if he had any reviews. Every one of them was a 5 star rating. I emailed him and we booked a 2 hour night tour (with my husband) to the Jemaa el-fnaa for some local fair and then a full day tour the next day starting at 9am He was prompt and professional right from the get-go. We started our walk from the Hotel Sofitel and already he was giving us some history of the city. We ate in the center square, had a nice meal, some local tea and he made the whole experience so easy. He helped us order and made sure we tried some new foods native to Morocco. The next morning he arrive to the hotel and again...made me feel at ease. He knew so much about the history of the city and kept saying, \"I hope to show you everything...I want to be sure you see all that I have planned for you.\" And we did!! I could spend all day trying to remember it all...I don't think we missed anything (except for the gardens which he offered to show me but I was too tired). Each stop was filled with more information and he even took me to a beautiful cafe (inside a riad) to the rooftop to enjoy the sun and quiet. Don't allow the concierge to book your guide for you. You'll be disappointed. Our friends ended up shopping all day and learned nothing of the rich history of this region. I could go on and on but needless to say, I left there feeling like a made a new friend....and probably did. He is excellent at what he does and it comes off as effortless. You will be very pleased with Abdul as your guide."

We couldn't have been more pleased. He is a trained and certified guide with a huge breadth of knowledge about his country and his countrymen. Although we enjoyed the main sights in the three areas where he offers tours, the medina, the Atlas Mountains and the Atlantic coast village of Essaouri, it was the special, unique parts of our trips that we loved the most. We visited a local bakery where women of the medina bring their dough to be baked in the wood-fired oven every day. We walked in the old Jewish quarter in the evening. We had tea and fresh bread and honey with a Berber family in a small rural village and we visited the weekly market in a small town on the way to the coast where we were the only tourists. Abdul told us a tremendous amount about Moroccan culture and it's treasures - the people, the crafts, the food, the scenery, the history. He was very generous with his time, so we never felt rushed. He adjusted his pace and the itinerary to our preferences. We had told him a little about our likes and dislikes before we arrived and he understood them perfectly and tailored our tours to accomodate them - thus we were never pressured to shop, we did not spend endless hours in palaces and museums, but had active days and not only the evening chaos of the Djemma el-Fna, but also visited lovely gardens and galleries, saw craftsmen at work, people going on with the chores of daily life, goats in trees and women grinding argan nuts into precious oil. He gently deflected the occasionally pushy vendors, and carefully and sensitively guided us in appreciating the role that the Muslim faith plays in the everyday lives of the people of Morocco. It was a wonderful experience to get to know this intelligent, curious, thoughtful, and gentle man who truly enjoys his work and loves his country and its people. I would recommend him without hesitation to visitors of all ages and all interests including families. We learned a tremendous amount and are curious to know even more when we return and ask him once again to be our guide."

We only had a half-day tour, but during the short time he showed us northern part of Medina - some interesting historical points you must visit, such as Ben Youssef Medersa, Marrakesh Museums.He also showed us basical \"how to explore Marrakesh\", such as how to get to Jemaa el Fna, or to our Riad.But best part for us was that he showed some places, where you can smell the life of people. We visited a baker and hamam (but no to bath, but to see men who is heating). We could also see how people play Gwana music. Naturally you could not experience those part without having guide.Abdul is calm, modest and comfortable person, speaks very clear English. Since it is a private guide, he can create a tailor-made walikng tour for you. Or you can tell him what you want to see. He was very helpful and made great tour for us.It depends what you need, but a half day could be bit short, but one day would not be too long. Abdul can surely make the tour intersting for whole day!"

The minute we met Abdul, we got a great vibe from him and his English is excellent. He asked us what we were interested in seeing/not seeing and he took us around the city based on this - which was nice as neither me nor my friend really cared to see too many museums. While on our tour with Abdul, we learned about the history of Marrakech, stories behind specific sites, personal stories from him about growing up in Marrakech - it was perfect! We had such a great day on the tour, that we hired Abdul again for the next day and we toured Majorelle and Menera Gardens which was really great. Another important thing to note, he never once (on either day) tried to take us into any stores so that he could get commission on what we bought. Apparently, this is very common with tour guides in Marrakech, but not at all the case with Abdul. All in all, it is definitely worth spending the extra $$ to have such a wonderful, knowledgable and trustworthy tour guide like Abdul. What a wonderful experience!"

We were delighted that through Abdul we were able to visit traditional bakers, musicians, leather craftsman, and stucco carvers and see them in action. It was a great experience to be able to meet some of the locals. My partner is very interested in music and he was thrilled to have the opportunity to play a traditional Moroccan stringed instrument. Abdul also helped him find some great CDs of Moroccan musicians.We had read in our 'Lonely planet' guide book that sometimes tourists can have difficulties with shopping in the markets of Marrakech, but Abdul made it a pleasure, with no hassles, and no pressure. He even carried my shopping bags! When we told Abdul what we wanted to buy, he helped us find the best quality authentic items for very reasonable prices. My favourite souvenir from our trip to the markets was a beautiful traditional Moroccan leather pouffe. We were able to watch the craftsman hand-stitching the leather pieces together - very fascinating! At the end of each day I relax and put my feet up on our beautiful pouffe, and I am always reminded of Marrakech! Abdul was an excellent guide in all respects. We can thank him for some great memories of our time in Morocco and we are very pleased to keep in touch with him on our return home. We would highly recommend his services to anyone visiting Marrakech. Our guided tours with Abdul were the highlight of our time in this beautiful city."

Little did we know we had just made the best decision ever!!Abdul met us at our Riad in the morning and took us on a \"best of Marrakech tour\" as we had no specific requirements. You name it, we saw it! I left Marrakech fully satisfied that in the short time we were there, I had seen everything I could in that time!! I was blown away by this tour and how wonderful a guide Abdul was. Along with all the main tourist areas that are mentioned in every guide book, we stopped at some really lovely places for tea and lunch along the way and saw some really exceptional things that just aren't on the tourist route, the \"real\" Marrakech.Abdul was very generous with both his time and his information. He is an excellent tour guide, charming, polite and just an absolute delight to be in the company of. I would not hesitate to recommend Marrakech Guided Day Tours to anyone travelling to Marrakech; you will not find better value for money for the fantastic experiences and memories you receive. If we are lucky enough to find ourselves in Morocco again one day, he\u2019ll be the first call I\u2019ll make because I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have more exciting things to show me!"

This city survives very substantially on its tourist industry and you will get taken to places where you have the option to buy but it is entirely a matter for you whether you do or not. We were a family of 4 with girls of 11 and 13 and he looked after us very well. I would thoroughly recommend him as a guide in Marrakech. My older daughter went back there on a school trip this year and I made sure she had Abdul's number just in case and he was delighted to be on hand if necessary."

We went from Ouarzazate to Errachidia. My driver was Hassan. He told us very much about the culture and the way of live in Morocco. I have respect for the way of life in Morocco and Hassan was the one who let me see that. I ate very good food, the hotels where okay en sleeping in the Sahara desert underneath the stars is magical.

He went to the trouble of letting me connect to his Internet and then calling the person we're staying with. I cannot thank him enough. All of the people at the shop are wonderful. They even invited us to break fast with them, which made me feel like I could really get involved with the Morrocan culture. The mint tea is beautiful, the best in the medina. We did the tour to Vallee Ourika which was perfect for our short stay in Marrakech as it's only around an hour to drive. We went to a traditional Berber house to have tea and bread and honey. We then went to the place where they make Argon oil and a lovely girl told us all the history in English. It is expected that you tip, so make sure you have some small notes.The lunch down by the river was traditional Morrocan cuisine and was tasty. I paddled in the river which was incredibly refreshing, and the service was good.We then drove to the waterfall, it was stunning. Take a bathing costume because you can swim, although it's so cold. Suitable footwear needed for the rocky terrain, not good for kids or the elderly. It is beautiful. Lovely photo opportunity and great way to cool off after the 20 minute climb in 40 degree heat. Our driver, Abdul was fantastic. Even though it is Ramadan, you wouldn't know. He was informative and friendly. Excellent driver and it was a comfortable car. He also took photos for us with our camera.Overall I really enjoyed it, and it was very reasonably priced compared with the competitors both online and around the medina. Thank you!"

We were a little nervous about going on desert tours with guys we didn't really know so we hesitated to book a 2 or 3 day excursion. After a few days of bumping into them regularly, and drinking lots of Berber tea, we got brave and tried a day tour. We had an excellent day touring the mountains and exploring a berber village and house, eating lunch in a riverside restaurant and visiting a women's cooperative that produces argan oil products. We got a little braver and looked at the photos and itinerary for the longer tours and decided to go. Unfortunately before we could book I got sick, and these guys offered us help and support every day, checking to see how I was and offering advice. We came away with new friends and will definitely be going back to spend some proper time in the desert with them. Thank you Mabrouk, Mohamed and Hossam"

The accommodation that was booked is really good and comfortable with a delicious breakfast everyday. Omar, our tour guide is a friendly and funny tour guide who make us feel like we are travelling with our own family member! Although the trip from one place to another place is quite far and required us to spend a lot of time in the car, we feel relaxed as the tour is flexible and we do not need to rush to follow the itinerary as the itinerary is well prepared by the tours. Besides, we really enjoy the scenery from Atlas Mountain which is covered with snow to the dunes of Sahara Desert as Omar would pull over for us to take picture of the beautiful scenery and he would tell us a bit about the places that we stop. The camel rides and star gazing experience in the Sahara Desert is really enjoyable and beautiful! Hassan also take care of our well being by contacting us once a time to make sure that we get all the things we need.

He welcome us the best Bereber way with a nicely prepared Bereber whisky :) ( mint tea). We decided to be true to our first impression. And we went with him on private to the desert tour with 4\u00d74 jeep. This was our best decission in 10 days of Marrakesh. The knowledge, the hospitality and the passion for making sure we were having a good time was impeccable. And at dessert if you will be lucky to meet this highly special Bereber ( Etri ) we had a star walk at night to the dunes, best food, hummour, and company truly real people. Recommend it!"

I am fully satisfied from the very moment we arrived at the Marakkech Airport till the last moment. ( Marakech Airport straight to Casablanca-Rabat(did not sleep there)-Fes-Sahara-Todgha-Marakech)Our guides Hassan and Umar are the best. They brought us to the wonderful places and always being flexible in choosing our destination in each places. They also tend to discuss with us about the destination and always recommend the best.Nabil, our guide in Fes is the best and lovely. He knows every single thing in Fes so dont worry you wouldnt leave that place without knowing nothing and he also helped us a lot shopping there. Instead he was the one who help us to bargain the prices and like i said he knows the best about Fes. So we did get the good prices with a very high quality goods. Next is Sahara Desert. We supposed to arrived there from Fes before sunset but we couldnt make it because it's winter time and sun tend to set faster. It take 7 hours for you to arrive in Sahara from Fes, but we couldnt make it as we stop at few beautiful places otw to sahara. But then we still can ride the camel while watching sunrise as we went to the camp by jeep and went back to the hotel with camel the next day. So it does make your life easier as it is flexible. Todgha Gorges also beautiful. You can get the feel of living at small villages between the big mountain with the sound of river from your room. Brothers at Sahara Desert Camp are wonderful. They welcomed you from the moment where you arrived and guide you to the tent and have dinner a together. If you are same like me, dont worry there is toilet in the desert. They set a bonfire and played their traditional songs i guess. Stragazing at Sahara is the best. It is not a scenery that you can capture with camera.Go and look on your own! Riding camel also one of the best memory :)So if you chose to go with Morahara, Do include Sahara Desert cause our original plan did not include sahara, but we asked to. So basically you can create the tour based on what you like and they will recommend what is the best. So after all, i can say that i am really satisfied with the Morhara Travel and it worth every penny you paid. We were so sad when leaving Morocco and it has been 4 days since we arrived in UK, but we are still missing Morooco. The hotels we stayed also gave the best services.Beautiful country with the kind hearted people, family. #CouscousSisters #SevenSisters"

Our guides for the whole trip , Hasan and Umar ; they welcomed us warmly and cheered us throughout the whole journey although with long hours drive. Nabil (our tour guide in Fes) is the best guide ever!! Really fluent in English, and he knows the history in Fes in and out especially the Old Medina. Really recommended! He bring us to tanneries, potteries, handmade weaving place, University al Qarawiyyin (oldest university in the world), maqaam of well known scholars in Fes and many different shops in the Old Medina. He even brought us to Nejjarine Restaurant in old Medina. The chicken tagine is so delicious! Thank you from 7 sisters from Malaysia to Nabil for the amazing whole day in Fes. An overnight in Sahara desert and camel riding was amazing as well! The campsite was great and very convenient! The food and brothers in the campsite is friendly and great as well. And please take care of us beige cap that I reckon misplaced and left in the campsite Abdul Salam (our tour guide in Marrakesh) is great as well. Always laughing and cheering us. He brings us to all different places with full explanations of history. But sadly due to limited time we haven't had to explore more in Marrakesh. Surely we might need to come back to explore more insyaAllah Hassan and Umar are a very great host! They treat us like fathers. Excellent driving skills with long hours drive especially in the Atlas mountain and throughout the journey from Sahara to Todgha Gorge. All the accommodation is very excellent!! Really convenient and exceed our expectation. Maamoura Hotel in Casablanca, Hotel Blue Sky in Fes, Kenneria Hotel in Marrakesh, Dar Ayour guesthouse in Todgha Gorge. Overall is very amazing! Really recommended!! Thanks Hassan and Umar for a very great journey together with 7 sisters from Malaysia =) #7couscoussisters"

But I honestly do feel that way.We spend 8 days 7 nights in Morocco. Mor'hara organized everything on point. They are super flexible i.e. we wanted to do the \"Cities of Splendor Loving Sultans\" tour and requested for one night in the Sahara desert, Liz took care of it, noooo problem.Hassan and Umar drove the 7 of us around. They are super friendly and really took care of us. We had Nabil as our guide in Fes (Awesome guy) and Abdul Salam in Marrakech. The accomodations in every city, as well as in Sahara, are better that I expected.The downsides: We didn't get to go to some of the places stated in the itinerary, especially in Marrakech. And one time in Fes they took us to an expensive restaurant for dinner. So I think you better tell the guides before hand, what are your price range for food.But other than that, everything was just amazing. The trip went smoothly and surprisingly quick. 8 days are not enough for me. I wish I could stay longer :( Will deffo come again soon. Mor'hara FTW!"

I call myself lucky that friends introduced me to his little shop and agency in the busy road of Riad Zitoun Jdide where genuine hospitality, a friendly hi and \"hello, how was your day\" welcomed me whenever I passed by. Patiently Idriss explained to me all the different tours they offer as well the meaning and traditions of the diverse beautiful stuff exhibited inside. I decided just for a short day trip upon his recommendation to the valley of Ourika and the waterfall in a small group. Well organized I was picked up without delay with a few other people - which turned out to become a lovely group. On the way the driver was always ready for a short stop to take a few shots to inhale the breath taking beauty of the mountain side in autumn in its golden colors. We stopped for good in Si Fatme where a local guide led us up to the waterfalls, always kindly supportive and patient for taking a view around, taking photos or just absorbing the beauty of this landscape - there are many photos on google images giving an idea about it, but the air, the breeze, the colors, the pure nature is much more beautiful than one might guess. I felt very grateful for this advise of this day trip!!! The lunch, taken at the river side was delicious and the tour back was very calm as everyone had to cope with the flood of impressions and the ravishingly beautiful landscape just before sunset. I felt very encouraged to go for more tours, but as my holidays had come to an end I can only count for the day to return and do more tours organised by Mor'hara. Marrakesh by itself is enchanting - but these day trips or tours are opening doors to a different quality of Morocco!! I'll be back soon!!"

We are from Scotland and we were astounded to learn the company's Scottish connections, it was definitely fate! They were so friendly and welcoming and invited us to join them for a lovely mint tea in their little shop. There are many different tour options from day tours to the coast or longer tours to the Sahara. As we only had a couple of days we decided on a day trip to Essaouira as we fancied a visit to the beach.The team were so flexible and helpful, as Hassan offered to meet us at our Riad in the morning so he could take us round to his jeep. We had a fantastic day at the coast and stopped along the way to visit the goats in the trees, an argan oil co-operative and we also paid a visit to the village where Jimi Hendrix lived in 1969.Lunch was absolutely fabulous. We told Hassan we loved fish so he took us to the port to pick up some fresh fish, and some bread and salad from the markets. The food was then cooked and served to us on a roof terrace with mint tea and fresh fruit. Delicious! Hassan is a very good driver and we felt very safe with him, especially when arriving back in Marrakech during rush hour (that was an experience in itself!).The guys are so hospitable and I cannot recommend them enough. We met and had tea with them a few more times before our departure a few days ago. As Mubarak said, it is a small shop with a big heart. When we come back to Marrakech we will definitely be doing the Sahara tour!"

In 3 days, we covered more than 1200 KM of beautiful Moroccan countryside with treasures and adventures all along the way. From the High Atlas to the sands of Erg Chebbi in the Sahara Desert, it was a visual and informational feast of the senses - and I have not even mentioned the mint tea, tasty tagines, and traditional Berber meals yet! This is a perfect way to see Morocco (especially if you are a bit short on time like we were) and fit in a ton of different things. You have your own private vehicle and guide (ours was Ibrahim) thereby making it a first class adventure. The hotel we stayed at on our first night in Dad\u00e8s Gorges, Chez Pierre, is one of my favorite hotels of all time (and I have traveled a lot). The people of Morocco are beautiful, kind and welcoming. Having a local guide like Ibrahim makes the whole experience that much better, as he knows everyone and will happily tell you what is what, and who is who. He knows how to make you feel like you are the star of your vacation. Don\u2019t miss out on a night or two in the Sahara \u2013 it\u2019s something you will never forget. The best advice I can give you is to sit back, let go of all expectations and enjoy the adventure, oh and pack light. You will not be disappointed. Don\u2019t hesitate to talk to your guides about the Berber/Nomadic way of life\u2026it is something to behold\u2026and as we learned, in the West we might have watches, but the Berbers, they have all the time."

It was comprehensive enough to cover the city of Marrakech, a night in Sahara desert, having a taste of local cuisine, and seeing the various berber villages.

Our guide, Ali provided us with great information about each place we visited, knew exactly which places to stop at for the best photo opportunities and was very attentive to our requests. The tour was a great insight into Morocco's great diversity from driving through the beautiful mountains to discovering the wonderful desert in a fun way, by 4x4 and with a camel trek. Ali was nothing but hospitable and professional throughout. The accommodation provided through the tour were lovely filled with scrumptious Moroccan delights! We particular enjoyed our traditional Berber lunch, and of course our night in the desert! This tour was a great highlight of our Moroccan trip, thank you Ali and thank you Camino Bereber!!"

These personal tours with this small company are awesome as your driver really makes you feel welcome.

Me and my partner arrived in Marrakech for a few days prior to the tour and after a bit of craziness in the souks, were pleasantly provided the best guide and driver in Morocco to take us on a tour of his incredible country. The experienced team of locals provide an itinerary beforehand but the tour is really up to you. Ibrahim made sure we saw all the sights but also provided helpful suggestions about places we might find interesting as well as locations for the best photos! The hotels and organised activities are second to none - don't miss out on the desert sahara tour or the todra gorge. Both are absolutely breathtaking. The highlight for us was meeting Ibrahim's family who live in the desert near Merzouga. We happened to be there for the end of Ramadan and got to meet the whole family and share a traditional Berber pizza with one of his twin brothers. From the moment we got in the car, Ibrahim made us feel like family, no question went unanswered and we ended up dancing in the car to Berber music more than once. Would highly, highly reccommend - it's been the highlight of our trip by a long way. Shukran Ibrahim and Camino Berber!Tip: Make sure you bring some smaller notes with you to tip the amazing locals along the way."

We absolutely loved each and every moment we spent in that amazing country. We went back home really impressed with Morocco itself and also by Moroccan people. We had the opportunity to visit unique places guided by a competent, committed, perfect professional. His name is Mohamed Amraoui and he works with Moha from Camino Bereber. Moha organized our program and he also arranged all hotels. Everything worked perfectly. We felt completely safe during all the trip. We believe that we had the opportunity to know Morocco in much more depth than we could have imagined or we could have achieved without having someone from Morocco, in fact a Berber guide that ended up as a Berber friend. We do believe that we had the best experience ever. Camino Bereber/Moha did a great job. And Mohamed was beyond amazing. We do strongly recommend both Camino Bereber and Mohamed to everyone that really wants to know all of the colors of this beautiful country. It was a rich experience and a great opportunity to review our own values and to try to find out what really matters."

After our first day, he was very good at picking up on the fact that we weren't just looking for all the well visited tourist destinations, we wanted to experience a true taste of Morocco. He took us to the places that he would eat. He taught us to speak Bereber greetings and how to haggle for everything. We met his brother, his friends and had a unique experience we will never forget. He took into account the needs of our daughters and was always \"looking out for us\" when we stopped to shop, feed or pee. If you are looking for something special and off the beaten, homogenised tourist track, then book a trip and ask for Hameed. Ask him lots of questions and if you are lucky, he will show you what it means to be a bereber."

Highlights include home-cooked lunch with Ibrahim's family, the dromedary ride (not camel), overnight in a luxurious tent with live berber music by the bonfire (on Christmas eve), visited the Ait Benhaddou (a UNESCO World Heritage site), travelled the High Atlas Mountains and shopped for organic argan oils.We had a great vacation!

We traveled all over the country, round trip Casablanca, where we spent our first & last nights. Moha was very easy to work with, making it clear that the published itineraries on his website were very flexible and he would arrange anything we wanted; there was never a problem with making changes. Mohammed was also very flexible and when there was something exciting along the way that wasn't planned, we went there--like a Rose Festival in the Rose Valley, the closing Fantasia of an agricultural exposition, and going off-road to a salt mine, among others. We stayed in riads in the medinas and most were very authentic and, in some cases, really outstanding. Mohammed & Omar were very good companions. Mohammed's English was very good and he was very patient with us. We learned so much about Morocco and the Berber people and there wasn't anything we couldn't talk about with him. We had a lot of laughs as we traded sayings in various languages. I did not give the review a 5 because Moha wanted the first payment sent via Western Union and cash for the balance when we were there. We did manage a payment by WU but it was a pain to have to go to an ATM every day to amass the $ we owed. (Morocco's dirham can only be purchased in Morocco). However, if you want to have an in-depth experience, I can recommend Moha & crew."

This, really, was the added value to our wonderful trip. Not only the variety of places that Moha chose to show us in a perfect balance of rural life, luxurious architecture, great food and real culture, but also his personal and unique stories about living in the desert and being nomads or farmers: he gave us Berber perspectives on many aspects of their history, society and culture. He is also great company, gives useful advice, and has secret qualities: he speaks fluently 8 languages and happens to be an excellent player of Berber castanets, which made the night bonfire in the desert even more attractive and fun. We strongly recommend travelling with him and valuing his tips. Thanks Moha!!!We will sure come back for a longer period and choose him as a guide. L&M"

But lo and behold, it was a trip really worth every penny -- everything would not be possible without Camino Bereber Tours!Touchdown in Casablanca, we were greeted by Idir (our driver) who is very passionate about his work. Instantly, we knew that the tour will not be a bore for us because of the personality of Idir, bubbly and full of excitement. We toured the cities of Casablanca, Marrakech, Essouira, Ifrane, Merzouga (dessert), Ourzazate, Fes, Meknes, Volubilis, and Rabat. All that in just 8 days of stay in Morocco. (Dont forget to get the Desert Camel tour when planning for your itinerary)It was a pleasant experience to have seen not just deserts -- but mountains, beaches, rivers/lakes, forests, and main cities. I couldn't have expected to tour almost all these places in just a short amount of time. Idir was very well versed with English and knows a lot of things on different places. He is a very knowledgeable guide and is always happy to assist you. Highly recommended tour and offers one of the most attractive rates too. Moha, who I initially contacted, was also very accommodating. He replies to mails very quickly and is able to assist us with our requests. He is also able to accommodate our suggestions for the tour for our own comfort. Never had a problem communicating with them. The riads which were also included in the package were very good -- if not one of the top riads that you can find in the cities.

The Riad gave us a a map of the city but it's not a very good map and wouldn't have been enough to help us find our way around. The narrow, often un-named streets are confusing and bustliing with pedestrians, motor-bikes horse driven carts. Few have pavements. On our return to the UK we learned of friends who didn't arrange a transfer from airport to hotel and never managed to find their hotel on the first night. We would have struggled too without our transfer.In the morning Nour took us around the key monuments and through numerous souks all of which was interesting, though it took a while to grasp the key points on recent history. Probably worth reading up a bit before you arrive. We were flagging somewhat when we stopped for lunch in a wonderful Riad - Dar el Cherifa - which was on our list anyway. Don't think we would have found it without Nour. Durling lunch we had the chance to talk to Nour in a wide-ranging way about politics, religion and learn a little of his personal ambitions. Without a doubt this was the most interesting part of our journey. Nour, himself a devout Muslim, was open to debate and discussion and took everything in good humour. With Nour we saw most of the key monuments of the city; although it was a long day and quite tiring, it meant that our following two days in the City we could wander to the central square and around the souks at our leisure and do so with confidence. Would strongly reccommend such a tour and Nour did a good job.In the morning"

At the second half of the tour he took us for lunch to the beautiful terrace\" La terracce des Epices, we would never find this place ourselves, its hidden in medina, it was amazing. Thank you Nour for this great tour. Highly recommend him."

He arrived promptly at our Riad and his cheery personality made us instantly feel at ease. Our tour was amazing. He took us to many of the most popular places, telling us so much about the history that we would not have known. He also showed us things we would never have found. We saw the Berber wool dying, how hammams are heated, how traditional food is cooked, we even had a local musician play just for us. It was wonderful walking through the souks with him as the traders understand you are not shopping so you don't get hassled to buy. He also gave us a few tips on haggling. Nour is a lovely and very intelligent man, he speaks 7 languages, his English was excellent. We highly recommend him for your tour."

This was our 2nd trip together to Marrakech and my 3rd trip and we had used a different guide each time before. Each one had taken us to a \u2018recommended\u2019 shop where you had been sold to under the guise of information but Nour was completely different not once did we feel he was \u2018killing time\u2019 by giving us a long history lesson on our time and money and not once did he take us to a \u2018shop\u2019. In fact I asked him about some edible roses and he went off and got them for us from a place that he felt would not over charge him.He was so fast in responding to our enquiry by email and we gave him the itinerary of what we wanted to see and he fitted it all in for us.Nour was great company and showed us places and things we had not seen before and was honestly one of the best guides we have ever had anywhere in the world and we always use a private guide either arranged by our agents or like Marrakech by ourselves.I was so impressed that I immediately booked him for a trip in a few weeks time when I am going back with a friend who has not been before as I know I will learn more about places I have been to before with him.Highly recommend him!"

We had the best day, visiting the main tourist sites and exploring the medina as well. My favorite part was our amazing lunch at Dar Charifa- I can't stop thinking about that chicken, lemon and olive tagine! Taking the time to explore the medina with Nour on our first full day, really gave us the confidence we needed to find our way around the medina and gave us some great insight into the culture and history of Marrakesh and Islam. He is funny, easy to talk to, and just a joy to be around. I cannot recommend his services enough!thank you Nour for helping us have the perfect honeymoon in beautiful Marrakesh!"

This gave us a great insight into the Medina so we could explore in our own later. We have no hesitation in recommending Nour for a guided tour, be sure to wear your walking shoes as he covers a lot of ground!"

Another guide recommended Nour so, after checking out a number of private guides on Trip Advisor, we decided to book a half day tour. Our transfer from the airport was delayed so we called Nour and he suggested that we put our timings back an hour; this was very thoughtful and really took away a lot of the rush on arrival. As we set off we talked about what we'd like to see and Nour comfortably guided us towards the souk, stopping off for a refreshing fresh orange juice from the market. We weaved our way through the souk, buying spices and stopping to look at things beautiful and unusual. We saw unexpected scenes in the back streets and debated over scarves. Moving through the narrow streets we took in some of the historical sites, walked through alleyways and squares and chatted about the forthcoming festival. We finished in the main square and before he left, Nour gave us a few recommendations of places to sit to watch the sun set. I would recommend to anyone new to or even revisiting Marrakech to consider engaging a guide to navigate around this wonderfully busy, chaotic, eclectic city. Nour was knowledgeable, personable and ensured we saw everything we hoped to see and a few things we hadn't even imagined. He very quickly picked up on the sort of things we wanted to see and made suggestions on options as we went around. We would definitely recommend his services as a guide to the city."

All correspondence was perfect via email, he collected us on time at the reception of our hotel and we were chauffeured in a very comfortable van. His day route to reach the ultimate destination of Imlil took us via some amazing scenery. We have stopped off at a nearby dam reservoir, took winding mountain roads up into the High Atlas with breathtaking views of the plain below. Just before noon we reached Imlil and we had an exciting hike through the mountain villages ahead of us to a local Berber house. After arrival at the house we were greeted by our wonderful Berber hosts, had the opportunity to get dressed in the local gown and afterwards overwhelmed by the hospitality and the abundance of food we were served. In fact, it was almost three full meals served for lunch and after a wonderful lunch time it was time to decent back to Imlil where our driver was awaiting us. We had an amazing, educational and thrilling trip with Nour and his knowledge and love for sharing information about Morocco was priceless."

He speaks excellent English (and German and Dutch) and was charming company as well as interesting and informative about everything we were seeing and Moroccan culture in general. And not a single attempt to lure us into shops in the guise of a cultural experience, which is always one of the signs of a good, professional guide I think. He took us to a handful of fascinating places we would have missed or misunderstood on our own, including the Jewish Quarter, a fondouk, a shrine, and the furnace of a hammam where we saw people coming back to collect their claypot meals which had been left to cook in the ashes, and were treated to an impromptu concert.He also took us to a really lovely riad for lunch; Dar Charifa. It's hidden away, so another place I don't think we would ever have found on our own. I would not have enjoyed Marrakech half as much as I did without Nour's excellent introduction, so I highly recommend booking a day or a half day with him when you first arrive. He responds to emails very quickly."

Nour was a very kind guide who spoke great english (and countless other languages too!) and provided heaps of information on the places that we visited. If we had any additional questions about the sites, Morocco or Marrakech, he was happy to answer them knowledgeably. It also felt a lot safer and easy going with him - any one knows that Marrakech is a very hectic place where salesmen can hassle you or call out at you sometimes aggressively. Walking with Nour, we were able to walk through the markets and streets not bothered and he told anyone who tried to get us to buy something or encourage him to lead us there no.He also took us to a lot of hidden places that were off the beaten track and not offered by a lot of the other guides. For example, we visited the Jewish Quarter and also saw a private little music performance by a couple of workers from a local bath house. It was a unique experience that gave us an insight into authentic Moroccan culture. Further, he brought us to the best Moroccan restaurant with some of the most delicious food i've ever tasted! All the workers seemed to know him and treat him/us really nicely, even the manager. Plus it has a great atmosphere, decor and viewpoint.Lastly, Nour was very accommodating and patient. We had to book a last minute tour and contacted him at 10pm, and he replied promptly and allowed us to tour with him the next morning. We were also a bit late to start but he told us not to rush and finish our breakfast. He even helped us buy souvenirs even though he doesn't usually offer shopping, as he knew we didn't have much time in Marrakech. Overall a great tour and tour guide - would definitely recommend!"

He guided us around the Medina and souks at our own pace and included a visit to the Bahia Palace, the Koranic School as well as visiting a local bakery amongst other things (entrance to these sights is not included in Nour's fee but he makes this very clear when booking). He was incredibly knowledgeable and very engaging when telling us the history and culture of this city and it's most famous sights. I cannot imagine how much time we could have wasted trying to find these places on our own!!! We stopped for coffee and it was very easy to sit and chat with him. What made this tour so special was that Nour was also open to answering our questions about everyday life in Marrakech, and also very happy to share his personal story with us. A must do if you want a cost and time effective way to see the Medina and to do it with a thoroughly decent guy."

We had an amazing, educational and thrilling day with Youssef and his knowledge and love for sharing information about Morocco and Marrakech was priceless to get an appreciation on your first day."

I highly recommend touring with him on your first day (though anytime would be fine). He taught us so much to help us enjoy the rest of our stay. He helped us learn how to get to the main square and souks from our riad, lots of history, pointed out places to visit on our own later, tips for staying safe and how to be less overwhelmed. He answered lots of questions. The souks really are a maze and we enjoyed looking at many different areas including the leather and blacksmith areas. We left at 11am and I was nervous based on another review that we would miss things by not going in the morning. Turns out the timing was fine. I didn't notice anything being closed and as I mentioned earlier I'm so glad we toured with Youssef as our first activity. We would have been very overwhelmed the first day (and possibly the whole trip) without all of the advice we received from Youssef."

We stared that we didn't want any shopping but a history tour of the Medina. Youseff demonstrated his excellent knowledge, giving us a real insight into culture and modern history of both Marrakech & Morocco as a whole (our son had already done a history tour the week before that had covered the ancient history). He took us through the maze of souks and alleys that we would never have found ourselves enlightening us with stories & facts as we went. Well worth the money."

            "review": "Poor arrangement. Could have been more enjoyable with the right guide.. I haven't written any reviews for a long time but I feel that I should write this one. I have read an overwhelming number of excellent reviews on Tripadvisor about different private tour operators in Marrakech, I simply am not happy with my own experience. I contacted Marrakech Tour Guide for a half-day trip in the afternoon with Youssef. Early in the morning of the trip I got an email from Youssef saying he had to cancel due to back pain. He would send his friend instead. I was suspicious but with such short notice I didn't have many choices and so I agreed to hire his friend. We got to the hotel around 3 pm and on the way from the airport to the hotel I noticed it wasn't very happening in the medina probably due to the heat. So when I saw our guide, I asked if it was a good time to visit the medina in the afternoon. He said we had booked the trip already and even if we canceled, we would have to pay and that's the way it worked. I wasn't going to cancel the trip but would like to see if there were other alternative activities he would recommend. So showing us his only concern was just about money didn't leave a good impression. We started our medina and the souk tour at 3:30. We went to a university, walked around the medina and the souk. I wish we came in the morning instead as many shops were closed. For example when we went to the communal bakery, it was almost closed and was empty, so we couldn't experience the local crowd coming to have their bread made. We didn't get to see the sheep auction in the morning either. I asked to see the tanneries but the guide told me that they were closed. I, however, found out later that the tanneries were open in the afternoon too. We could have gone and I was disappointed. I would strongly recommend a tour in the morning if you have a choice. I did ask before I booked if afternoon was happening in the medina but didn't have any reply. The guide took us to a silversmith in the medina. He made good locks. However I wasn't ready to pay 50-60 euros for some heavy super-size lock as a home decoration. The guide tried to sell them to me and said these were the people that I wanted to HELP. They were over-priced. Then the guide took us to a wood shop. The shop owner wanted to sell me a small wooden toy box in which a snake popped out when one opened it. It was cute but I wasn't interested. He started first at \u20ac15 each, then \u20ac20 for two and I wasn't interested and walked out of the shop. Then the guide called me back and asked how much I wanted to pay. I told them I was not interested and the owner offers them at two for \u20ac 15. I was firm and told them I simply didn't want any. Then the guide let go and grabbed a couple of small toy horse figures for my children to make up for his pushiness. I traveled with my 7 and 5 years old boys. The guide didn't engage them. Unlike what I read on Trip Advisor about how guides are great at interacting with children. There was hardly any interactions between this guide and my children. They were bored and wanted to go back to the hotel. I asked to take them for ice cream then. Overall, this guide is just below average. (1) show more concern about money than how to tailor-made a good tour for this customers. (2) pushing us hard to buy in his friends' shops. (3) not good at interacting with young children. (4) Not good at reading people. When we wanted to spend more time at the snake charmers, he was rushing us to go. He just failed to deliver although he repeated a couple of times \" You see, I am trying very hard.\"Youssef did call before and after the tour to check how things went. It unfortunately didn't my experience."

Our guide Kharroubi had a wonderful personality and showed us everything that could possibly be seen. By using a private guide, you can see a lot ,escape the crowds and see other beautiful sights that normally a large group could not. Youssef was very responsive in pacing the tour with what we wanted to do; we could ask to take photos and \"chill,\" at any time during the tour. What makes this the ideal tour is the attention to details; Youssef Kharroubi and his driver treat you as if you are their family, which creates a very welcoming atmosphere.We can t wait to return to Morocco for another trip.Highly recomended"

Our day started with Youssef meeting us at our Riad to escort us to the car for the first half of the tour, \"palaces and monuments.\" At each stop, Youssef accompanied us and provided a wealth of information site, as well as vast amounts of information of Moroccan and Muslim culture that we would have never learned elsewhere. He gave generous time for pictures, especially at the Jardin Majorelle, my favorite stop. The next three stops, Bahia Palace, Koutoibia Mosque, and Saadiens Tombs, took us through centuries of Moroccan history, politics, culture, and architecture. After a few hours of the tour, Youssef led us to a luncheon at a place with quite possibly the most scenic panorama of the city. Per Youssef's suggestion, we ate the chicken and lemon tangine which filled us up for our dive into the souks! The first half of the tour would have been difficult with Youssef's help, but the remainder would have been impossible. He navigates his way through the twisting and curving medieval medina as though he's walking through an open filed. What's even more amazing is that he does not meet a stranger. Following Youssef, we began to truly appreciate the \"organized chaos\" of Marrakech! We commenced our souk tour buy visiting a Moroccan pharmacy of sorts where we were given a short demonstration about Argan oils and other healing herbs and spices. With Youssef, you do not have to bargain, and he ensures you are getting the best quality and service. We also visited a lantern store, shoe store, and a store for tea sets with similar experiences. In fact, after leaving one store, I realized I'd made an accidental purchase. Not to worry with Youssef! He calmly returned to the store and everything was worked out! Finally, we visited the rug cooperation. There, we had an intriguing demonstration of the various regions of Morocco and the types of rugs made there. Again, Youssef ensures that you are getting the best price and quality. After the rug shop, our day with Youssef was nearing its end. He escorted us back to the Riad and even showed us a few surprises along the way only a true Marrakecki could spot. We hated to say goodbye to our new Marrakechi friend, Youssef. My brother and I both agreed we would have enjoyed his company and knowledge for our entire journey. I've done many similar tours across the world, and this one was one of the very best! Youssef's knowledge of the city, great personality, and savvy shopping skills in the souks make him an indispensable guide. If you want an unforgettable time in Morocco, contact Youssef! You will not regret it! I look forward to his help in my future visits to his lovely country! "

We were confident about all arrangements made.Youssef collected us in a car from the Pullman Resort at the time agreed. He gave us the benefit of his wide knowledge of Marrakech places, people, politics, Monarchy and more and our questions were answered in perfect English. We were taken to a rooftop restaurant at midday. It was a place we would never have found left to our own devices. Unfortunately Youssef did not join us as it was Ramadam. His driver with an air conditioned 4x4 confidently negotiated the narrow streets in the Medina Old Town, without a problem and was waiting for us after we had seen each attraction. This was very welcome as the temperature was 34deg C plus. I also find walking distances exhausting and Youssef regularly asked was I ok.We would recommend this likeable man as an excellent tour guide. Don't delay to contact him as he is a very busy man.

On the day of our tour Youseff met us on time at our Riad and took us through the Medina explaining the history of the city as well as educating us on larger cultural dynamics of Morocco. His historic and contemporary knowledge of Marrakech and Morocco was thorough and enlightening. He is well known throughout the Medina and you will not be bothered by anyone while in his company. He had his own driver who would whisk us to our next location with great efficiency. When our tour was over he would leave us at a restaurant I had chosen and made sure to give us very good directions back to our Riad. Having spent the morning together he had learned of some of our other plans for our visit and offered to help arrange transportation for us to the restaurants and bars we were planning on visiting. This relieved us of the need to engage in the horrible haggling and rip-off schemes of the local taxi drivers. Sure we paid a bit more to get around ($10 each way vs. $5) but our drivers had nice cars and would call ahead to our Riad so we were met and never go lost. So worth it. Youseff is a great tour guide and a good person to know during your visit to Marrakech and I recommend him thoroughly."

The idea of 'tours', is not pressure to buy, take note please..... Seeing the rug being hand made was nice, but the next half hour being shown rugs and totally ignored that we 'didn't want' to buy one was annoying! This was a main theme! Reminiscent of the tuk tuk tours from hell in Thailand where they take you where THEY want you to go and refuse to go where YOU wish.... Being told to tip everyone and having to pay for the Jardin Majorelle, when we'd paid 75 euros for the tour, each! Was on the nose... The fish in the muddy damn, ho hum, not a tourist Mecca. Trying to convince me to buy expensive argan oil, when you find a local food shop and buy it very reasonablely priced .... Too much time where we didn't want to be, waiting at the exits for him for far too long, then rushed through the areas we found of interest. I wouldn't recommend this. We also noted other guides doing the exact same thing, other people being led to where they didn't wish to be and their guides refusing to stop when asked. We shouldn't have to risk getting lost when stopping to take a photo because the tour guide won't stop for you! We saw the palace, but far too much detail. Waiting for the car in the heat when finished wasn't pleasant at some sites either... It didn't wait most times. The lunch was the one standout, FANTASTIC, total luxury, but it was tinged by the deep sadness I felt on seeing the way the poor and the animals are mistreated while being walked through. Beggars selling discarded shoes, skeletal humans, almost right outside this amazing Persian restaurant, like being inside a palace itself.... The musicians inside exotic, mountain people in traditional costume, the music eerie and the type of foreign we're here to see.... the food fantastic the atmosphere so plush, then starving people outside, I wanted to invite them in....

When I reached Youssef, he said that he had clients but if I could get there quickly, he'd take me along. So glad I could make it.Youssef showed us parts of the Medina in Marrakech that only a Marrakechi could know. I loved going through the Souk with him and having him greet half of the shopkeepers with the beautiful Moroccan greeting of a kiss from the heart. He also showed us some real inside spots of the man stoking the hammam fire and another tending the local bake oven.He could answer any and all questions and his warmth, humor and knowledge led to my falling in love with the country."

Upon arrival it became apparent that to see the best of what Marrakech has to offer, we would need a guide.Came across Youssef by chance and can honestly say we learnt so much from him. He was extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgeable as well as being passionate about his city. Would not hesitate to use his services again if we went back to see even more of the city.We booked two seperate tours with him for one afternoon and the following morning. He collected us prompty from our Riad and asked us for our thoughts etc on what we would like to see. During the first tour we wanted to see the main sights of the city which we saw and much more. On the second tour we wanted to see more of the \"real\" Marrakech and so he took us to local markets, seeing local tailors, cobblers, community ovens, butchers etc. Both tours were excellent and we saw much much more and learnt more than we ever expected. Yousseff knows all of the alleys etc like the back of his hand which is just amazing. He also seemed to know everybody and we were greeted warmly by people wherever we went.Don't hesitate, just book!"

I took the 1/2 day tour and it was an amazing introduction to Marrakech! I especially liked the cultural aspects of our discussion while he walked me around the Medina. I had so many questions about their culture, history and religion. It is almost like we should have had a coffee/tea for 2 hours just to get the foundation laid so then I could have paid more attention to the sights. Walking around the souks was so enjoyable as he guided us around, I could really see the welcoming nature of Islam. I thoroughly enjoyed the carpet demonstration and the confidence he gave me in not needing to feel pressure to buy. It was sincerely demonstrations of the products and the shopkeeper lifestyle. I appreciated him letting me do the crazy cobra photo. I think my favorite stop was seeing the shrine wall to the king and learning about his progressive leadership style. I had a great time and I would recommend booking this tour with Youseff."

Youssef Kharroub was an absolute gem. I would recommend him to anyone who wants to have fun and really understand what makes Marrakech so special. We came away with a feeling for the people and politics of Marrakech, not just an understanding of the historical sights. Youssef was happy to move as quickly or slowly as we wanted. He never pushed us any harder than we wanted to go. He was a wonderful ambassador for a wonderful country. When we have time to return to this vibrant city, Youssef will be our first call. His email, for those who want to reach him, is y.kharroubi@yahoo.comEnjoy!"

He then took us on a half day tour of the city. He even brought us to the grocery store to buy wine, water, and snacks since we were too exhausted from our travel to eat out. But before he left us that evening at the hotel, we made plans for the next whole day of our private tour.We saw the Jayden Garden first to avoid the crowd. He walked us around and gave us the history - Absolutely beautiful, must-see place. He filled our minds with the culture and history of every place he took us. Plus he was careful to slow the pace for my mother, who was pooping out. We lunched at a wonderful restaurant before taking my mother back to the hotel to rest.After that my sister and I hit the shopping area of the medina with Yousseff carrying our bags. We told him what we where looking for and he guided us there, thwarted off any unwelcome salesmen, and taught us how to haggle. Loads of fun. He was always concerned with our comfort and satisfaction.When our day was done, he arranged for his driver to take us to dinner that last evening, and the next day to the airport.He is a wonderful guide and host. I hope to play tour guide to him one day if he makes it to New Orleans, Louisiana. I recommend Yousseff Kharroubi for any travelers, especially Americans.Joan S. March 2016"

I've traveled quite extensively, usually alone and have never done a tour. With Youssef I quickly understood the value of a good guide as I saw and learned so much I would have otherwise missed. Youssef tailored the time to my requests, which seems obvious for a private tour but after another experience with a guide in Fes and talking to other travelers- this doesn't always happen. Youssef was excellent with answering my questions and providing information to help me orientate in Morocco, which is exactly what I wanted. Had I tried waking around by myself I would have missed seeing and learning so much. Youssef helped me appreciate Marrakesh and I thoroughly enjoyed the half day we spent together.

We booked with Youssef very last minute, and he was the only guide out of 6 that was available to take us around for a half day in the souks/medina, which I was very thankful for. He was very responsive to emails and got back to me right away. Unfortunately, he had some family problems the morning we were supposed to meet, and we waited at our hostel 30 minutes before we could finally get ahold of him. Thankfully, he sent another guide to meet us and take us around for the day. We later spoke and he was very apologetic. (Emergencies do come up.) The guide was very helpful and showed us around, while giving us lots of historical and cultural information about the area. I wish he would've taught us a bit more, but maybe we should've asked some more questions, as well. Be prepared for extra entrance fees at Ben Youseff, another museum, and the music playing place, which are not included. We saw a little bit of everything (architecture, traditional music, hamman heating area, spices/argan oil place, dyes and coloring of fabrics, wood carving), but in the souks, it seemed like he just brought us to the places he had friends and tried to get us to shop there--- whom were disappointed when we didn't buy. My husband felt that we could\u2019ve used the 55 euro a much better way, but I thought it was a nice activity for our first day in Marrakech and a good introduction to the city."

We covered many of the districts in the medina with Yousseff making stops to tell us facts and teaching us the ways of the city.He took us behind the scenes that we and every other tourist would have just walked by such as Community ovens, hammam workers quarters and where the leather is dyed, metal work is crafted and former Muslim schools.Youssef was always ensuring that we were kept interested and he knew EVERYONE which was because he was a very likeable guy.He finished the Tour at Jemma El Fna squaew and told us the directions to our riad which were spot on.I assure you he is veru much needed."

We've all travelled a lot and felt confident going to a new place, but still decided to take the advice, which is how we spent a day with Youssef in Marrakech, and it was a great choice! We had wandered a bit by ourselves the afternoon before, which is definitely doable, but a bit overwhelming. When Youssef came, we had a general idea of what we wanted to see, but nothing terribly specific, so he took us on a great all-day tour. We made lots of stops at small museums (probably spent about $20 in admission per person to go to 7 \"museums\" in total throughout the day- including palaces, old Koranic schools, royal cemetery, Yves St. Laurent Garden, etc.- a great deal and definitely worth doing) which was great. Youssef knew about everywhere we went, came in with us, and gave really interesting information everywhere we went. Without him, we would have gone in (though on our own, it is unlikely we would have ever found these places) and gone out, without a good idea of what we had seen. Youssef gave great insight into the history of all the places we went, including how that relates to the cultural and religious fabric of today's Morocco. We had a few specific requests of things we wanted to do or buy and he helped us with those as well. He brought us to a lot of everyday places that describe Marrakech life (the communal bakeries where people bake their bread, where the local hamam (bath) is heated). And he really seems to know everyone in Marrakech. Wherever we went, everyone knew Youssef. Youssef knew his way around the city and easily brought us all around the city and back to our hotel that night. Youssef was incredibly nice, and interesting to talk and listen to.

However, my friends and I(party of 7) only had one day in Marrakech but definitely wanted to do camel ride as well as souk and old medina. I asked Youseff if he can arrange airport transfers, camel ride, and Marrakech tour. He quoted me a very reasonable price(which made me more impressed). It was hassle free right from the airport. He arranged a transfer which was already waiting for us at the airport. The driver was very professional and such a nice guy. Then we met Youseff. He is very informative, professional, and has a good sense of humor. We went straight to Palmeira for the camel ride. This was a once in a lifetime experience! Abdul, the camel tour guide was great as well. Very happy man to show us around and introduce us to his camels. After the camel ride, we had lunch. Then started the Marrakech tour of the palace, then souks. I wish we had more time to do and see other places in the country. We were very impressed with the city. People are very happy and its a clean city. I am definitely going back to Morocco sooner or later and stay longer and go to other cities, and hopefully Sahara desert. P.S. Youseff arranged transfers and camel rides therefore we only paid one fee to him but please please please do TIP the driver and the camel ride guides as well. 50dirham is less then 5gbp/5usd. They are very nice people. You can skip 1 starbucks coffee and give that money to them. They are very hardworking and very pleased to show their beautiful country. Another thing I liked about Youseff is that he would give money to beggars. Just showed me how personable he is."

We're both very much into history, and Youssef was extremely knowledgable not just on the sites we visited but on all the other questions we had. He was very open with us when discussing current affairs and how everything in recent years has been viewed within Morocco.At the sites, he gave us great amounts of background before providing us time alone to wander (which always seemed like the perfect amount). Some of the experiences we had (such as the community kitchen) we never would have found otherwise. And the lunch he took us to was incredible!Overall it was a great tour with a great guide and we will be recommending Youssef to everyone we know who goes to Marrakech."

Although we only had one day and the package we pre arranged was only for the Souk and Medina, we saw much more. Youssef gave us the most bang for our buck. He took us to the highlight of Marrakech, as well as the off the beat and path spots, that only the locals would know about. A side from the entrance to the garden and the initial taxi ride, we Youssef explained prior to the beginning of our trip, we paid no extra for our trip.

Youssef is rightly proud of his city and his country and is well known an respected. The tour was conducted in a friendly yet efficient manner and Youssef gave us a great insight into the city and its culture. In the morning he collected us from our Riad. Some of the tour was on foot and some in a very comfortable taxi. We stopped for a delicious lunch in the beautiful 'Le Jardin' restaurant which was a relaxing place to refuel before exploring the souks. The tour was a great introduction to Marrakesh and good value for money. Thank you Youssef"

Youssef speaks excellent English, is a very proud Moroccan and really knows his stuff. We spent the morning visiting all the sites which one would expect to see but then after lunch, we were taken to the souk. Youssef seemed to know every corner and lane in this maze but more importantly, knew every trader, artisan and shopkeeper. We were introduced to the world's best rug salesman and the world's best Argan Oil saleswoman - our luggage when we left Morocco was heavier than when we arrived. A day with Youssef is not be to be missed."

He took every effort to make sure we cover the places to see, for e.g ensuring that we are in time to catch the Camel ride at sunset as well as the movie museum along the way which was closed to public for filming when we went there but he would try again on our return journey. As a result we came back much later than the targeted 6pm, but he did not complain about clocking in the extra hours driving Long distances on the mountains to get us back to Marrakech by 9pm. He also helped us to find the Riad that we have booked when he sent us back. We had a lovely time during these few days and got to see so much of Morocco, thanks to Youssef. And we always felt safe with him around. Highly recommend this tour to those who want to see the Atlas mountains and Desert."

I do mean Youssef. I had about Youssef on trip advisor and after reading many glowing reviews I emailed him directly and he confirmed with us a desired date and time for our tour. Granted our booking was about 2mo in advance. one week before our trip I refreshed my tour with Youssef and he was prompt to reply and confirm. The night before our tour Youssef called our Riad and confirmed that we would meet in the lobby at 9AM. This was great to know he took the initiative to call the night before and not have us wondering if he would show up the morning of without contact the day prior. Way to go Youssef. After he picked us up at our Riad lobby he went through the day's itinerary. In the itinerary he did not mention the tanneries and so I asked if we could go there as part of the trip. He hesitated a bit stating that there were many many pushy locals there, but now in retrospect there are pushy locals everywhere. He was able to take us to the tanneries for a brief moment. Overall Youssef was friendly, polite, knowledgeable, and had the timing right. he knew where to go first and avoid the line of other tourists that would inevitable show up right after us. If you are looking for a guide through your Morocco experience do not hesitate and contact Youssef. I must say his fame is growing and there may be a time when it may be hard to book with Youssef. Get your dates in as soon as possible, sit back and relax. Sincerely,DanielOH, price, about $100 US for a full day trip. This did not include tickets to local attractions or lunch. Youssef does not join you for lunch, I have had guides in other countries that will sit with you during lunch and you would end up paying for their meal. I like that Youssef gives you space with your family during lunch so you can speak freely and relax."

Youssef was very punctual at meeting at us at our Riad and he greeted us with a big warm smile ;0) Bahia Palace was our first port of call (entry fee 10Dh each) Old Boarding School (again small fee for entry) Youssef has boundless information on the history of these places and his love and passion flows out so you find yourself feeding off his energy. You can tell he is a well respected man and is greeted by many folk along the tour, but this does not detract from his attention to detail. Youssef literally opens doors to places that you would never have the opportunity to visit. It's a world that at times can be very humbling. It is a good idea to take a little small change with you, so you can show your appreciation to certain folk when needed. I can't fault this Tour at all, it was perfect and Youssef is such a great guy too. I promise you wont be disappointed."

Youssef will answer all and any of your questions with detail and candour. He left us for lunch at a very nice restaurant which wasn't expensive - much appreciated. After lunch we visited a carpet cooperative which was educational, but be wary, the education also came with a ver savvy sales pitch. We said we would return to look at the carpets again the next day, and did intend to, but time did not permit.

Youssef was not able to do our tour but his friend hassan met us at our riad and was more like a kindly uncle as he led us through the souks, waiting patiently outside as one or other of us dived into shops in the souk.

We never actually met Youssef but could not have been more pleased with the arrangements he made for us - we went through the souks, to the Ourika Valley, and finally to Essouira on three different days and with three different guides - all were prompt, all were polite, all were knowledgeable. And it ALL was reasonably priced. I especially have to take issue with the recent reviewer who took Abdullah to task for having the audacity to show customers some items in the souks that they might actually want to purchase - what were you doing in a market place if you didn't want to be shown items that might interest you? - Abdullah was a fantastic guide who showed us the same things (carpets, woodworking, leather) that he showed you and we found it fascinating - plus he did a great job of haggling on our behalf - not only that, but it was made very clear you didn't have to purchase anything if you didn't want to - Abdullah was extremely friendly and worked hard to make sure we had a good time - he felt like a personal friend at the end of it - we thoroughly recommend Youssef as a tour guide service"

As female travelers, it was important to my sister and I that we really get to explore the Medina, souks, etc more freely without too much stress/worry of pushy vendors, etc. Youssef provided us with this more intimate view of Marrakech, as well as teaching us so much about the history, culture, daily life of the city and its' inhabitants. He is not only very articulate and knowledgeable about the city, but his love of Marrakech is also very evident, which made him a top notch guide. I'm so glad we spent the day with him and were able to gain a better understanding of this beautiful and interesting city and its' inhabitants."

From the very beginning, Youssef was keen to inform us about the history, culture and traditions of Marrakech. He was full of local knowledge, enthusiasm and humour and customised the tour keeping our interests in mind. You felt like you were sightseeing with a friend rather than with a tour guide. He made us feel completely at ease and gave us lots of information including trivia, which was fabulous for our inquisitive minds. We saw all the main sights as listed in his website including a few more, which was a real bonus. We were keen to buy a lamp for a souvenir, and he recommended a lovely little place which had some really lovely unique artisan lamps. Youssef also went out of the way and gave us his taxi contact (Ismail) should we need cab. Thanks Youssef!"

With Youssef you don't have to worry about searching for places that are hidden behind souks or navigating in a city with practically no street signs. We booked a full day tour (10:00-16:00) in late February.PROS:- You'll see places you wouldn't know to look for: how a traditional hammam is heated, \"the cheapest accommodation in Marrakech\", public oven, etc.- Youssef knows so much about local life, culture, politics, etc. You can ask anything and I bet Youssef is able to give you a thorough answer. - Within few hours you'll see most important sights there are to be seen. It will take much, much longer to visit (and find) them by yourself. TIPS:- Bring along some money for the entrance fees. We visited 4 places with tickets, in total ~150 dhs per person. - Also take some small change (5/10/20 dhs coins/bills) to give as a thank you to people Youssef introduces you to at more hidden \"attractions\". - Book a full day tour and don't worry about going through places that you wouldn't see during a half day tour. It is so much easier and more interesting with Youssef."

It was an amazing experience, friends had told us that it was a dangerous city but not at all, in the contrary it was quite save, very friendly people and helpful. Of course they need to make a living so they will try to sell everything to you but that is part of the experience. I had contacted a guided tours company form the states before going there and after many questions I asked, they offered to go to my hotel upon my arrival to explain their services. The next morning Radouane (from the tour company) showed up at our hotel and from there on everything was just amazing. He took us to tour to the Medina, the falls, the dessert and I can not say one thing that we did not enjoy. They included some of the meals too. Radouane was just great, very knowledgeable, entertaining, professional, polite and always on time. He has the best spots to go, very quite and not like those group tours that you lways feel in a rush. Let's just say that I left adding him to my facebook and whatsapp and I don't do that at all. He became our friend.  We have been to Cancun, Virgin Islands, New York, Chicago, LA and I can say that Marrakech is among the top visits I have been to. Mainly thanks to Radouane and his team. You can find them at visitasguiadasdemarrakech.com. You will not regret paying every penny or euro or pound when you go out with them. JUST AMAZING. Thank you Radouane! Pasamos Navidad en Marrakech-Marruecos. Fue una experiencia espectacular. Muchos amigos dijeron que era una ciudad un poco peligrosa pero no lo es en lo absoluto. Es muy trankilo y la gente es muy educada y tranquila, solo quieren venderte sus productos pero eso es parte del encanto que tiene la ciudad. Los paisajes son espectaculares y gracias a Radouane y su compania de visitas guiadas pudimops conocer y disfrutar sitios espectaculares. Raduane (el guia de la compania) fue exelente, tiene mucho conocimiento, es divertido, muy amable y sobre todo puntual. Puedo decir que nos fuimos de Marrakech dejando un amigo que espero visitemos de nuevo muy pronto. Los lugares donde nos yevo vale cada centavo y cada minuto. Los recomiendo 100%. Lo pueden encontrar en visitagguiadasenmarrakech.com. De todos los sitios que he estado con mi esposa, Marrakech esta entre una de las primeras. Gracias Radouane y tu equipo por tan grandiosa experiencia.Recommended Tours - Tours Recomendados:Ourika ValleyMedinaLas CascadasLas GargantasTrip to the Dessert (Amaaazziiiiing!!)Kasbah AmridilTheir Website is visitasguiadasenmarrakech.comGraciasCarlo"

He was patient, attentive and dealt with our mobility problems with sensitivity. With a personal tour like this you get much more involved than you could possibly get on a group tour, background, history, answering your questions in impeccable English. And all this for a very modest price!We did a mixture of the regular tourist stuff and some sites off the tourist trail, and although Youssef doesn't know everybody in Marrakech it certainly seemed like he did! In his presence we wandered through the souks, acknowledged and greeted but never hassled, and a short walk after he left showed just how much we had been protected!I cannot recommend his tour too highly, great trip."

I also asked for some 'off the beaten track' stuff, and he showed some to that effect. He knows EVERYTHING about Marrakech and was very patient with answering all our (many) questions Strongly recommend as your guide in Marrakech - both for those in town for the first time and return-visitors!"

I would suggest having the tour with Youssef for your first day in Marrakesh to get acquainted with the city.Only con for Youssef was him pushing us to sell both Marrakesh and him for other tourists to come in the future. He was good enough for me to do it though :-)"

My Wife and I could not be more thankful for Youssef and his hospitality during our half day tour around marrakech. He was very patient and gave us time to take pictures but also highly knowledgable and enthusiastic about his city. The different cultural details he pointed out about the politics and togetherness of the city helped us better appreciate some of the rich culture that surrounded us. The tour was AMAZING and I would HIGHLY recommend Youssef to anyone that is interested in visiting morocco and truly embracing its loving culture. My wife and I had troubles with our first Riad and we really appreciate that Youssef went out of his way to contact friends and put us in an AMAZING Riad which we thoroughly enjoyed. He always re-assured us that we didn't have to finalize payments on anything so he was not being a salesman. Just a very helpful tour guide. Thank you Youssef for making our honeymoon in Marrakech so great and going above and beyond."

I wouldn't even have attempted it, but Youssef was the soul of descretion and always found a toilet when I needed one!!!We booked him from the U.K. before we left and despite what his website says he asked for no payment up front. His 50 Euro fee was no more than a half day excursion organised by our tour operator would have cost for two of us, and for this price he will take four, and of course we had his undivided services for over 3 hours.He even treated us to a couple of local delicacies during our tour.We cannot recommend him too highly"

My mother and I took a one day tour around Marrakech with Youssef- I had read the wonderful reviews on TripAdvisor, and we were not disappointed.Youssef is a wonderful guide- knowledgeable, well spoken, able to judge what his guests are looking for, and careful in where he takes you. We had arranged everything before we arrived in Marrakech, and I was certainly pleased that we had.Youssef seems to know everybody around town- at times it felt like we were accompanying a city-celebrity. It was quite fun, watching Youssef greet everyone- truly 'where everybody knows your name'Youssef didn't take us to any shops, didn't push us to buy anything, showed us the hidden parts of Marrakech and made sure that at no point did we feel tired or rushed or as if he was just ticking a box. He took us to the Majorelle gardens, the Bahia palace, the Medressa and also into the inner souks of Marrakech, as well as showing us where Tanjia were being made as wellAt the sites, he gave us a good explanation, then allowed us time to explore on our own- we didn't feel rushed and certainly saw everything we wanted to (and more)Youssef is a true gentleman, and a knowledgeable and trustworthy guide. His English is more than fluent, and I am sure his Japanese is of a similar quality. I can certainly recommend him as a guide round Marrakech(just a note, make sure you have small change as well as Youssef's fee- to pay for the taxis and all the site entrance fees)"

Youssef showed us the YSL garden, the Bahia palace and the souks. He did not try to take us to shops and do hard sells like many guides do and this is what makes him the better guide. He helped us with directions around the Medina and was keen to show us hidden sides of the Medina such as the place where the public hammam is heated but it was a Friday afternoon and the place was already closed for the day but anyways we really appreciated his efforts. He was very kind to buy us a moroccan crepe which was delicious and we enjoyed a friendly conversation at the end of the day sipping mint tea. We enjoyed learning about his religion and culture.We would def use him again and highly reccommend him."

He met us outside our hotel and showed us around in the Old Medina. He took us to the small hidden places we would not have found ourselves and told us everything about the life and culture of Marrakech. It was very interesting and he was a great storyteller! He also gave us a lot of tips about everything from things to see and the best places to eat. The second day we wanted to see some more of Marrakech outside the Old Medina, and because Youssef was busy that day, he arrange a car with his college. This we decided the day before, so they were very flexible. The car picked us up at hotel in the morning and the driver took us to Majorelle Garden, the view from H\u00f4tel La Renaissance, a public park and we got to see and take pictures of camels. A lot of fun!We highly recommend Youssef as a guide the first day. It gives you the great overview of Marrakech and knowledge about the culture. The tips you get are also a bonus!

            "review": "Youssef is a gracious and interesting guide - I thoroughly recommend this tour!. After an initial misunderstanding of where to meet, Youssef came to our Riad and met me and my daughter to take us on a wonderful walk through the medina. We were staying at a Riad by one of the gates in the wall so were a good 20 minute walk from Jamaa el Fna. However, this provided a good opportunity for us to wander through many of the less tourist-trodden areas of the medina to give us a taste of traditional, authentic Marrakech. Youssef is, as others have said, a knowledgable guide who maintains a commentary for pretty much the whole three hours or so. He provides you with just enough historical context of the people who inhabit both Marrakech and the surrounding Atlas Mountains, offering some insight into Berber culture and traditions. What was particularly good about this tour is that Youssef took us to places like the back of a hammam to show us how they heat it, and into the local bakers, where people take their bread to be baked. In many respects, it seems like life has changed little for hundreds of years - apart form the odd TV set of course!Youssef is clearly very proud of his city and culture and this comes across delightfully. He also appears to know a lot of people so there are brief waves, smiles and chats with locals along the way. He took us to Madrasa Ben Youssef, which is well worth dipping into for a quiet half hour, and told us about the role of the former Koranic school, and then on to the souks. Here, Youssef was especially good, as he helped us to orientate ourselves (which proved very useful on later visits) and showed us what was sold and where. Youssef will not encourage you to buy and does not take you to his friend's/brother's/uncle's shop, so there is never any pressure, which is a relief. This is a well worthwhile activity. Youssef is a gracious and interesting guide and I thoroughly recommend his tour."

He engages with you and shares his knowledge of his city which is both insightful and interesting.

During the visit , Kharroubi not only pointed out information about the monuments, and other history related items, but provided comments about shopping and restaurants. We should have taken better notes or pictures of those places so we could have found them easier the next day.The city , the souq and the maze are so overwhelming that I don't think that we would have had any idea of what to see in Marrakech without taking this private tour . our short visit to Marrakech was both rewarding and satisfying. The fee charged was very reasonable for the outstanding value we received.. In sum--Kharroubi tours well exceeded all our expectations."

I had said that we would be at our riad at 2pm, but passport control at the airport took over 2 hours, so we didn't get there until after 3. I was worried that Youssef would have left, but he hadn't. He waited for us all to get ourselves sorted, and then we had a pleasant afternoon walking to the main square and a bit around the markets. Beware of being short changed (not by Youssef), but we went to a terrace caf\u00e9 for mint tea and I gave a 200 Dirham note and got only about 35 back - so my drink cost nearly \u00a315! But my fault for being tired and distracted.The next day we again had our three guides, and rather than just doing a walking tour Youssef gave us the option of driving to the various destinations (extra cost of 60Euro for the day for the vehicle for 6 people), which we took. Again he was very good with his descriptions of places, pointing things out that we might otherwise have missed.All in all, very pleased with him."

Yousseff was booked so offered his colleague, Mustapha whom was fantastic. Mustapha was extremely informative. We felt that we were able to see the true Morrocco through his eyes. Friendly, he made us feel just as if we were his guests in his own home. I do feel I need to say that do not let any of these negative comments sway you away, for people need to realise that this is a business like any other and life happens. Worth every single dirham and much much more. What a bargain!! Honestly, look no further and book this tour on your first day straight away!!!"

I contacted Youssef based on the reviews on here, and after faffing with it for a long while (it's a bit difficult to get a large group of ladies to come to a decision!), he became booked and booked a colleague - Abdullah - to take us around instead. I had some misgivings as I was booking based on Youssef's reviews, but I needn't have worried. Abdullah arrived promptly at 9.30am at our hotel, and took us on the experience of a lifetime. He showed us all the normal tourist attractions including a few things off the beaten track. His obvious passion for history and his culture, his eloquence, and clear guidance every step of the way turned this from a box ticking exercise (\"Yup, that's Marrakech done!\") to an amazing heartfelt experience. He was invaluable when it came to bargaining in the souks, and he advised us on where we needed to steer clear of. We did later meet Youssef at a cafe later, and his desire to ensure that we'd had a nice time was an extra touch that rounded off the day nicely. Please do not hesitate or look further: see Marrakech through the eyes of people who obviously love their city. You'll be glad you did."

We enjoyed his side notes on various places and felt free to ask questions as we went. He takes you to places and you then pay to enter. He usually waits outside while you visit at your leisure. He will customize your tour and help you avoid high-pressure sales if you ask him. My only suggestion would be to try to avoid making/receiving telephone calls during tours...evidence of his success but a bit distracting. Excellent guide!"

He is very passionate when he talks about Marrakesh and he speaks good English. He also told us he speaks fluent Arabic, Japanese and french. He was even happy to organize another day trip and excursions outside the city and has many contacts with tours and transport services. He answered all our questions and we never felt rushed.He showed us the back streets of Marrakesh and the alleyways that lead to back of ham-mams and the sites that you don't see as a tourist. He navigated the busy streets with ease and got us to all the sites in time. Overall I recommend Yousef without any reservations , He is possibly one of the best guides in Marrakech..."

During the afternoon we saw parts of the souks we would never have found without Youssef and really opened our eyes to what was available and how it is all really made locally. While in the Souks we also visited Ben Youssef Medersa, again something we just never would of seen without Youssef.His knowledge of Marrakech, and the history surrounding Morocco was amazing.If your in Marrakech, contact him and arrange something, we only organised it a couple of days before, well worth the money, far better value than the holiday company tours."

Youssef knows the history of Marrakech and his country very well and will take his time to explain anything about it or about the culture that comes along with it. His beliefs differed in some respects to ours (he supports a strong monarchy and an islamic education for example) but that wasn't necessarily a problem. In the end we obviously just wanted to understand the country better and that worked out fine. Actually Youssef was a great guide since we could openly share different ideas (he was also interested in our ideas and habits) without necessarily having to decide which one is better than the other.Last but not least, this guide will not take you to all kind of different shops where you will feel obliged to buy something (for a price which will be to high)."

His rates, by the way, are a lot more reasonable than some of his competitors. He collected us from our hotel the first morning, with a plan to visit the main sights in a sequence to avoid the crowds. We used a taxi several times, Youssef negotiated the rate, (and we thus learnt the going rate for a journey, very useful as in our entire week there we never saw a taxi with a meter).Anyway, he really smoothed the path for us, stopping traffic so we could cross the road safely. Marrakech can be a trying experience for first timers, but no such worries for us, as we glided along serenely in Youssef' wake, pitying other tourists struggling with their maps, having to ask directions etc. However, when the experience was just there to enjoy, i.e. Jardins Majorelle, and later lunch we had some time to ourselves. He took us around the souks in the afternoon, explaining their evolution and historical significance. There was no shopping involved or any attempt to introduce us to shopowners.Youssef proved a first rate guide, very knowledgeable about the history, architecture and cultural background of his city, but also a very warm and engaging character with a great sense of English. His English is fluent, and I believe he speaks other European languages too.We have taken a number of private/small group tours over the years and this is way up among the best."

He spent more time with us than just half a day, as well as organising a driver to pick us up to take us to Le La Palmeraie for camel riding in the evening. Have to say it was incredibly camel riding while the sun was setting! The following day, Youssef had another driver come pick us up for our trip to the Ourika Valley (this was only suggested the day before by Youssef). The driver was late; however Youssef himself came to our hotel to apologise and took us for traditional mint tea. He was unable to accompany us, but his knowledgeable friend/driver took us to the valley and even stopped on the way for a photo opportunity and lunch courtesy of Youssef! A guide was called and took us up the mountains to get to the waterfalls (make sure you bring trainers!). It was beautiful up there and would have to say the highlight of the trip!If you want a tailor made holiday, choose Youssef, he will fill you with knowledge and you will leave wanting to come back again!Thank you so much for making our holiday so memorable Youssef!"

After a few emails we had set a date, time, and place - it was very easy and he is very efficient with communication. We had scheduled to take our half-day tour the day that we arrived. However, our flight was a little late, and it took ages to go through immigration so we contacted him a few hours before our scheduled meet to see if we could change the day because our son (11 months) was very tired. Once again, he replied promptly and said it would be no problem and we arranged for the next morning.We had our tour today and it was wonderful. Youssef is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about Marrakech and it's people. The tour seemed to fly by as we were shown things that we never would have seen if we had just walked around by ourselves.He was very patient with our son and was extremely understanding when we had to stop our tour momentarily to feed him in the middle of the souk - he even managed to get a stool for me to sit on from a lady who was selling bread! One of the many things that made Youssef a first-class guide is that he did not once take us into a shop/s. His tour is purely based on the history and culture of the Medina (and Morocco/Marrakech). Once our tour had finished he showed us to a restaurant that locals use (our request), and arranged a driver from the Medina to our hotel in the Palmarie with a pit-stop at the Majorelle Gardens.What more can I say except that if you want a guide within Marrakech then go with Youssef! You wont be disappointed and you will end up learning a lot more than you think while avoiding being taking from shop to shop just for commission!!"

Having navigated the labyrinth of narrow streets and Souks without success we chose to use a guide. A guide was secured for us by our Riad Manager at the Dar Alhambra and we were introduced to Youssef. His instruction and help explaining the key parts of Marrakech was excellent. We also very much enjoyed the information he provided as to the Islamic faith and its impact on those in Marrakech. After a packed half day touring the historic parts of the city, the Souks and Jeema el Fna we parted having being dropped at Majorelle Gardens pleased to have not only learned so much, but also being provided with the confidence to explore more of the city ourselves. Youssef is an excellent guide and we would very much recommend him to any new traveller or even seasoned travellers to Marrakech."

A camel ride in La Palmerie - it's a typical tourist thing to want to do and exactly what we wanted. Touring around we got personal and political insights that no guidebook could deliver.

A very gentle man with a nice humour & exceptional knowledge, Youssef guided us around the city in a safe & very pleasant manner. He told us plenty about the culture, religion, architecture & customs of Marrakech. There was no overloading of religious sentiment, just facts on the people & history of the city. Most importantly, there were no introductions to hawkers & sellers. This was to be conducted in your own time, outside of the tour schedule. He devotes his entire time to showing you & telling you the history of Marrakech & the tour was conducted at a good pace. There is time for tea, of course but no more time is wasted. Youssef, we thank you for your guidance. We really enjoyed our 3 hours with you & hope you enjoyed our company too. We would not hesitate to contact you again on another visit. We highly recommend you."

He was prompt in his email correspondences, arranged for our round trip to/from Casablanca, took us around Marrakesh for an incredible, unforgettable tour that was fascinating, eye-opening and fun. Youssef has an enchanting personality and a love of history, religion, languages and art. He is easy going, accommodating and respectful of your wishes and desires. We had a blast going through the alley ways and markets, the square and the old city, we ate with the locals, met and spoke to them, haggled alongside Youssef with the local shopkeepers for unusual gifts and 'tasted' the culture through the local eateries, the gardens, the palaces and historical monuments.If you are looking for a special tour of Marrakesh, with someone who has been everywhere, knows everything and everyone look no further. If you want a guide who speaks great English and French; someone who absolutely LOVES Morocco and Marrakesh and can show you things in a unique and unpretentious way; look no further. Youssef is your GUIDE!We got to see Marrakesh 'behind the scenes'; simple, special and authentic - something only the locals get to experience.Thank you for a memorable time in a beautiful part of the world with a GREAT GUIDE! highly recommended!!!Nov 18, 2013"

He was explaining historical, cultural and religious aspects of Moroccan society and it helped me to understand much better such a beautiful country. He also answered any single questions I asked him and gave me some good suggestions of how handle the rest of my days in Marrakech. One thing that I really appreciated in Youssef is that he didn't push me in any of the shops and he gave me the total freedom of looking in the Souk without feeling the pressure of buying from the local stands.

He is an articulate young family man with a good command of English and who was born in the Medina. We said that we wished to see certain sights & cover the Medina & the Souks, but equally importantly we wished to spend half an hour with him discussing the day to day lives of the people. This we did & it was most informative.We intend to make a further visit to Marrakech taking in the Atlas Mountains & on that visit we will certainly engage Youssef to cover the ground that we missed on our first visit.As also mentioned in a comment by another traveller, Youssef at no time pressurised us to buy anything or to visit a business where he might be entitled to a commission on a sale.We would highly recommend Youssef given his intimate knowledge of Marrakech & his ability to meet the particular & varying demands of any visitor.Jersey, Oct. 2013."

We arranged a half-day tour with him through our Riad for the first full day of our visit, and I'm so glad we did. Marrakech is likely an unfamiliar environment for many Westerners, but Youssef made us extremely comfortable when showing us around his city. He grew up in Marrakech (yet speaks excellent English), so he knows everyone and everything (my wife and I joked that it was almost like he was the Mayor of the city - as we walked around, everyone seemed to know him). He gave us great tips on how to walk around by ourselves and provided a very good history lesson at the palaces and tombs we visited.One enormous plus about Youssef is that he did NOT try to take us to any shops, as I've heard some guides do (and then you end up the back of a rug shop under a lot of pressure to buy something). We were more than capable of doing shopping on our own, but we wanted a cultural experience from our walking tour, which is exactly what Youssef provided.(Finally, Youssef is a very kind man. One thing I noticed is that he gave money to every poor/blind/homeless person on the street. I think that just goes to show that he has a good heart.)"

In desperation I read all the reviews on here and found Youssef.we emailed him and got a response the same day, we were so lucky to get some time with him and he was a champ for squeezing us in at short notice. We booked a half day tour with him the following afternoon and as we wernt quite sure of what to see, he planned it all for us which we were happy about. He took us around the souks, the riads, Jemaa al Fna, the old Quranic school and told us little facts about the many temples and attractions. Having grown up in the medina, Youssef knows the labyrinth-like souks like the back of his hand. We could really tell he was liked and respected by all the people there.The next day he booked us a tour to the Ourika Valley and the Atlas Mountains with his driver Ismail who spoke good enough English and was a very nice guy. He knew alot about the Berbers and their way of life and told us alot of facts, we learnt so much. We went to see the famous waterfall and went to a real Berber house and a spice shop where we were shown how the spices are made...there are several tourist traps around here but don't be obliged to buy , just say no. We had lunch in a stream made by Berbers..a delicious chicken tagine and played music by some Berber folk musicians...an experience to remember! Youssef checked up on us various times by phoning the driver which again shows how much he cares about his clients.The following day we went on another half day tour with Youssef...through La Palmeraie, the Saa'dian tombs, Palais de la Bahia and Maison Tiskiwin. Then we had a drink on a restaurant rooftop and watched the bustle of Jemaa El Fna. It was thoroughly enjoyable and Youssef really looked after us. I was sorry for our time with him to end.Youssef is a gentleman, a kind, well educated and genuinely nice guy to be around. He will really look after you and his prices are so reasonable! Don't bother looking anywhere else, Youssef is your man! he taught us so much about his city- he is so proud of Marrakech and the city loves him in return.

We went to Agadir for a week and had decided before we went that we would not go to Marrakech as we knew it was a good distance and we wanted to rest. When we arrived, our tour operator was offering a 2 day trip with Sahara Tours and we couldn't resist as we knew that the thing not to miss in Marrakech was night time in Jemaa el Fna square which the overnight would allow.Make no mistake, this is a long trip - but we were thrilled we did it. We set off at 7 a.m. on the coast road to Essouira - a rough windy road over the Atlas mountains and along wonderful surfing beaches - arriving in Essouira around 11. 30 a.m. It was very windy (almost cold!) which is the norm here (hence the surfing). It is a wonderful town and it feels like it is unchanged for hundreds of years - thankfully globalisation has not yet reached here! As we wandered around the town - basically a large souk - local rushed past with their carts full of their business wares and we felt like intruders in a life that has been going on quite well without us for aeons. After lunching on fresh fish, we continued the remaining 170kms to Marrakech, arriving as the sun set. We went by horse drawn carriage to our dinner venue - an amazingly ornate interior where we had delicious tagines and couscous - as much as we wanted and served by friendly staff - after which there was traditional entertainment. We went on from here to Jemaa el Fna where the entertainment was amazing - sights, sounds, smells, colours - and crowds of people. Every form of entertainment was there from snake charmers to the barbary apes, dancers, berber water carriers etc. You need a stern constitution to ensure that you are not taken for a ride and you need to be very firm as you will be plagued if you give in just a little!!The next morning we visited the Majorelle Gardens which were restored by Yves St. Laurent and which are small but beautiful. After that, we returned to the souk - a maze in which it is a delight to get lost - where we were first given a tour and then were left to our own devices for adventures! It was 43C when we were there so the fresh squeezed orange juice in the square was welcome at 40 cent for a large glass.Our overnight hotel was fine - nothing special but perfectly adequate - and had a nice pool where we had a quick swim after a buffet lunch before our trip back to Agadir - this time on the new motorway, arriving at 6.30 p.m. very tired but very happy."

He is incredibly knowledgeable, fascinating, helpful, and able to draw from his own background, having been raised in the medina himself, which certainly serves to further enhance the authenticity of your experience. His driver, Hicham Abouchadi, is also one in a million. Hicham, like Youssef, will do everything possible to make you happy, comfortable and feeling a part of the amazing Marrakech community. We absolutely love both of them and highly recommend them to anyone visiting Marrakech."

Mustafa was incredibly knowledgeable about Moroccan culture, history and religion. It was completely worth having him. He was inexpensive and showed and explained so many things that we missed when we went to the Medina on our own. But the most enjoy about part were his stories about past kings. It's almost not worth going to the Marrakesh without getting a tour with Youssef and Mustafa."

We started the day with Youssef coming to our Riad where we had a chat about what we wanted to do along with some of his suggestions. We then headed off, getting a taxi to the new town and went into the gardens that where previously owned by Yves Saint Lauren, this was then followed by a taxi back into the old city where we visited the main Palace. From there we walked to the main square where we stopped for some lunch. Next we where taken through the Souk before heading to the historical Islam school beside the Ben Youssef Mosque and then taken back to our Riad. He made us feel very welcome and comfortable throughout the trip with small stops at different points to highlight things that we would have been clueless about. He has a very pleasant manner and is very knowledgeable which created a great experience and I would recommend using his services. We didn't find out about him until we arrived and I searched for tours on my phone. I then simply sent him an email and from there we where able to make suitable arrangements, so that was also nice and simple. He also costs a lot less than you would pay for pre booked tours from tour operators. Thanks Youssef for a great tour."

Youssef was more concerned with my wellbeing than anything else. I was determined to go on this tour. We spoke candidly and talked about various issues that are germane and Important to daily Marrakechian life. I had to cut the tour short because I was not feeling well, but I really enjoyed my afternoon with Youssef. I really recommend booking a guided tour with him. You won't regret it. Throughout my entire stay in Morocco, Youssef kept in touch with me to make sure that I was alright and to see if I was enjoying my time in his country. A big thank you to him!"

A native of Marrakesh, he knew where to take us to really get a feel for the people, products, faith, history, and cuisine of his city. He met us at our riad and we explored a garden, school, palace, marketplace, and many other places. Everyone seems to know him. He helped me negotiate a great price on a caftan, and accompanied by him it did not feel intimidating to meet carpet sellers and herbalists...no pressure! We had lunch in a simple local restaurant, which was surprisingly inexpensive and quite delicious. His English is excellent and he knows Japanese, French, and Italian too. I think this is a great alternative to a group tour, and with his flexibility someone who is in a wheelchair or has small kids etc would all get the tour appropriate for them. Thanks Youssef!"

You wont be thrown in the tour just for a count \"I've been there\" Youssef will design or \"taylor\" the program personally for you !One day tour is definitely not enough but to dive in Marrakesh craziness every day for half a day is absolutely perfect shot to get it all in the best way possible.

He has a vast knowledge of the city as well as the history of Morocco in general and was able to answer all the questions we had. He also let us into the secret that for great food seek out a 'Tanjia' rather than a 'Tajine' as it is a much slower cooked dish and so more tender and tasty. And he was right!I've never booked a guided tour before as I've often felt you should discover a city yourself. But the half day we spent with Youssef set us up for the rest of our stay in Marrakech and gave us a great grounding in what is often a bewildering and chaotic city."

We did exactly that on 2 other occasions right on the square with excellent views of the square and the mountains if you dine up top. You should only be paying \u00a34 to \u00a35 each in total.

We had a half day tour of Marrakech, which started at Bahia Palace. The palace itself was quite nice and Mr. Kharroubi showed us around the palace providing the historical background. The tour was followed by stroll to Koutoubia Mosque and Minaret. Then we got into the souk, on which we needed a tour guide most, had a browse through the shops before reaching Ali Ben Youssef Medersa. Mr. Kharroubi was friendly and informative of the Marrakech culture, and seemed to know almost everyone we came across in the old town. I was initially worried about the difficulty of roaming the souq, which is a twisted labyrinth of alleys filled with shops and food stalls. However it was a great experience overall with great knowledgeable local guide, who truly helped us to make the most of our short stay. I would actually recommend him a local guide. The half day tour (3.5h) cost us EUR45 (excluding tip) for two of us."

The Tour gives you an overview of Moroccan politics and economics in both historical and contemporary settings. It heightens your appreciation for its cultural and social aspects and it takes you on an adventure of the most exotic sights, sounds and aromas and fragrances. Morocco is a melting pot of both indigenous people and tourists of various origins. At times I likened it to an airport lounge. On a personal level you can seek lots of advise about your stay which is grate when you don't have family you can refer to . Yusuf is hugely patriotic and is always looking to promote many aspects about a country he feels very passionately about. If you want the Moroccan experience this is the Tour to help you get it. On a final note I am intrinsically linked with the UK, Pakistan and the Philippines and have traveled a bit, but Moroccans are some of the most affectionate people I have come across. We will always look back with lots of affection."

He is efficient, answered our emails immediately, and was punctual picking us up at the agreed and place. As a guide, it is clear that he is very knowledgeable about Morocco, and it helps that he speaks very good English. We were particularly impressed with his flexibility regarding our plans for the day and his willingness to help us out. Rather than following the plan he had made to show us the sights in a walking tour, because my son had a hurt ankle, we requested a car and driver, which he quickly arranged (for an extra fee). We visited a rug center (at our request) and a palace (at his suggestion). In the afternoon, we asked Youssef to find an orthopedic doctor for our son, whose ankle was getting worse. Youssef was great: he found a clinic, helped us arrange the x-rays and see a doctor, all within an hour or so! He even lent us Dirhams to pay the bill at the clinic, drove us to a pharmacy, and then found an ATM machine so we could pay him back. We couldnt have asked for someone more helpful!"

Youssef responded quickly and I booked the trips.Youssef and his driver picked us up from our Riad right on time and we took a tour of various sights ending up in the souks. Youssef speaks perfect English and is obviously very intelligent. He gave us lots of information and it was very interesting. He checked with us exactly what we wanted from the tour and would have done anything we wanted. Being our first proper day in the city we had no real idea and so let Youssef choose.We went deep into the souks which was fascinating but did feel a little rushed as it got towards midday. I understand he has a time scale and other commitments so I can't complain about this but in hindsight I would have done a little less palace and a little more souks.Youssef does take you to a couple of places where the shop owners do a bit of a show and sales pitch. The herbalist was interesting and we were happy to spend a few dirams. Having Youssef there, I didn't find this oppressive.We then did a tour of the Ourkia valley. Youssef did not come on that but we had the same driver we'd had on the first day. We had a wonderful day. It is a really interesting place. The drivers English wasn't great but he tried his best to tell us about the various places. My only slight issue was that we weren't really told what this day entailed and so we had no idea how long the trip was or how long we had the driver for. It turns out (I think) that we had him all day but not really knowing this we may have hurried ourselves a bit.Finally, and the reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 was the price. It was agreed beforehand and we were happy with it however when we got to Marrakech we found lots of deals and much cheaper options to do similar tours.(I think it is the off season so there are lots of offers) Of course you do get what you pay for and I have no problem with the first tour tour with Youssef which was worth every penny but we could have got the trip to the Ourika Valley for a third of the price we paid, for what was basically a taxi ride.That said, if you are visiting Marrakech, and I wholly recommend you do, Youssef is an excellent guide and a very nice man!"

He was born in Marrakech, knows all about it and loves it! We were taken to special places as well as to common places, where life flows independently of tourists' visits. We managed to see people, shops and streets that we would have never managed to see on our own. While we walked around, Youssef would tell about history, politics, art, culture and practical advice. It was a great experience.Also, everything is CHEAPER with him. We hired a taxi, bought fruit, sunglasses and other items much cheaper than at any other time. And the shops were chosen by us, not by him (one could tell he did not know the shopkeepers). Youssef bargained on our behalf and got it much cheaper. He did not avoid arguments to protect our interests and make sure that we are not charged a sort of \"tourist charge\"; instead, he wanted us to pay the amount he would have paid. It is his vision that one can only help Marrakech by playing straight with visitors. We will be visiting Marrakech again with our 3 children and we are definitely going to contact Youssef Kharroubi.

I found Kharroubi by good luck and he immediately took me into the heart of the ancient city, down side streets that I wouldn't have found myself and introducing me to lovely people along the way. In my few hours, I was utterly enchanted and felt very at ease with my knowledgeable and friendly guide. I told him what I was wanting and he made it happen. I wish I had a guide like that in all the cities I travel."

I am not usually a fan of organized tours, but my friends and I were really hoping to do a desert excursion. By the time we were finished, we wished we had booked much much longer with Marvelous Morocco. Iddir was incredible - everything was planned perfectly. Rachid, who we spent the majority of the time with, was such an angel. He did absolutely everything to make us comfortable and happy - plus he was so much fun. We saw so many things and made so many stops that we would have never found on our own. This was truly the highlight of our entire two week Morocco-Spain vacation. So much love to you Rachid & Iddir, thanks for everything!!! Hope to see you again soon."

We wanted to modify the trips that were posted, and Iddir made that very easy to do. Radoin, our driver and guide, was superb .... exceptionally knowledgeable, a very careful driver, and a lot of fun to be with. We spent an extra day in Erg Chebbi and had a fantastic time touring the desert with Radoin, visiting sights he knew well from living in the area. We clearly did things and went places other travelers did not do, which made the time extra special. I cannot say enough good things about the experience."

We were met at the airport by Rachid who was our guide for the majority of the trip. He was absolutely fantastic. Rachid was very sensitive and accommodating to the fact that we were a group of 4 females traveling alone. The food and Riads were all fantastic. I have no complaints and am planning on setting up another trip with this amazing company! Inschallah! If you are planning on going to Morocco, you will not be disappointed in utilizing Marvelous Morocco Tours! Reasonable prices and they treat you like a family member!

Iddir picked us up at our villa in Marrakech and took us up and through the Atlas mountains, Roses Valley, Dades valley with an overnight in Chez Pierre Hotel. Then onto the Todra Gorges, Erfoud, and Merzouga Camel trekking with a night in a Berber tent. The third day we continued our trip to Fez and spent two nights in the lovely riad Yacout Fes. The following day we went Chafchaouen spending two nights there. Iddir took us to Casablanca where we spent the night and caught our flight home in the morning. Not only did he take us to Casablanca but he picked us up at 3 am to make our flight back to the US. We were all thrilled with our trip and especially the dedication and care that Iddir provided. He was always there to make sure we were taken care of and went out of his way to make us happy! Iddir is also an excellent guide and so well informed about the history and culture of Morocco. If you are traveling to Morocco be sure to use Marvelous Moroccan Tours and ask for Iddir."

Ali arrived at our Riad on time on the first day and took exceptional care of us throughout our 4 days with him. He made sure we had plenty of photo stops (and refreshment breaks!) along the journey. We absolutely loved the night in the desert and the camel trekking. A night under the shooting stars is definitely an unforgettable experience. We also had the pleasure of meeting Iddir along our trip who was great fun too. The only recommendation I would make is to have a bit more of a structured information pack ahead of the trip. I had lots of questions ahead of the trip, as I'd never done anything like this before, which Iddir answered promptly but felt like more information at the start would have been helpful. Would definitely recommend this to anyone though! As two young females, they made us feel very safe and comfortable."

We spent 10 days in Morocco and doing the 4-day desert trip with Iddir from Marvellous Morocco tours was definitely the main highlight. From the very start, Iddir provided the highest level of professionalism, collecting us from our Riad, taking all of our bags, always making sure that we were happy and that we had a brilliant experience overall. I was overwhelmed with the attention to detail in the accommodation Iddir arranged for us. All of the guesthouses and hotels were beautiful and surpassed both of our expectations. Iddir and the staff in each hotel could not do enough to help us and cater to our needs regarding food, comfort and entertainment. More than that, Iddir treated us like old friends of his, telling us anecdotes and personal stories from his childhood about the different sights we saw throughout the mountains and desert. He made the journey very special and memorable, even bringing us to his sister's home where we were welcomed with traditional Moroccan mint tea and delicacies in preparation for a family wedding. The night we spent in the desert was amazing. Iddir arranged everything down to the last detail: we rode camels at sunset with a small intimate group of other travellers, stayed in a nomadic camp and had dinner brought out to us under the desert stars. Iddir and his friends played the Berber drums and sang while getting us involved with the dancing and music. Everything about this trip was special: Iddir was helpful, organised, friendly, approachable, enthusiastic, thoughtful and highly professional. He was as important as the breathtaking locations themselves; a tour guide and a tour company I would recommend to friends and family without hesitation. Lastly, the trip was very reasonable and was much better value for money than most other tour companies we researched. A winner!"

Everyone was raving about it so I stopped looking and decided to contact them. Iddir was very prompt and professional in his correspondence. He sent itineraries and answered all my questions. I had very high expectations because of the great reviews and I was not disappointed!We were in Morocco for 7 days but the highlight of our trip was the 3 days we spent with Iddir. We are a family of 4, my husband and I and our 2 daughters. Iddir treated us like family. We felt safe and secure unlike our other experience while in Morocco where some tour guides mainly took us to shops where we're cornered to buy things instead of see the sights. Our tour was the 3 day Marrakesh to Fez Desert Tour and it was amazing!!! Sleeping underneath the stars in the middle of the Sahara desert is a once in a lifetime experience and should be on anyone's bucket list! I highly highly recommend doing this trip with Iddir as I can guarantee you that he will look after you well. What I like about Marvelous Morocco Tours is that it's a family business and you get to meet Iddir's family along the way. We stopped by his sister's house in Rissani where we got a glimpse of the local way of life. It was amazing hospitality as she welcomed us into her home and had couscous and mint tea with her family. You can't get a more authentic Moroccan experience than that! We also met Iddir's brother, Hassani, who took care of us while in Merzouga, at the Sahara desert. He was so sweet and looked after us well. At the end of the tour it really felt like we're leaving family behind, our Berber family.Given the chance I would definitely book with Marvelous Morocco Tours again, as I'm definitely coming back!"

Every meal that you are given is AMAZING!!! Especially the night that you are out in the desert. It is seriously like you are staying in a five star hotel, desert style. Incredible. The night in the desert was let alone worth the money. I've never enjoyed something so much in my life. We rode camels into the sunset (which was absolutely spectacular), then played bongo drums, ate amazing food, and looked at the amazing stars in the desert. It was absolutely incredible. I would definitely recommend this tour group to anybody looking to see Morocco and have some fun. Iddir was amazing, and made the experience that much more awesome!

We got to go to meet some of the local nomadic peolple for a little bit and get a taste of real Morrocan life.Iddir is a real local and brings a lot of his knowledge to the trip. It feels like being brought around by a distant cousin or relative. He spoke great english ( as well as many other languages) and answered any questions we had. He brough us to a lot of little off the road spots that you wouldnt get the chance to see otherwise as well as joining in on the fun. When we booked the tour, we were expecting to be sleeping in hostels or self-cooking accommodation but instead, Iddir booked us into great hotels. All weith mod cons, excellent service, food and music. We felt very welcomed and looked after in each place we stayed. Then in the evening he would check in to make sure we had everything we needed as well as teaching me how to read the stars in the desert. That he himself had learned from his grandfather. He is an excellent tour guide. He looked after us very well. We felt very well cared for and brought around. What makes me write such a positive review is that he made us feel very welcome as friends rather than just a tourist visiting. I strongly recommend him for any family visiting."

We are retired and at the age of 76, with joint replacements, heart stents and a knee that doesn't always want to work, we knew we would not be able to keep up in a group. So it was the 2 of us in an very comfortable 4x4, and Iddir was our driver & guide. We asked for medium priced accommodation & were pleasantly surprised how delux the small hotels were. Breakfast and dinner were included and delicious. We could even order wine, which we found difficult in Tangier. We did an overnight camel ride into the desert which was magical. The day was 107F so Iddir made sure we were properly clothed and onto our camels in the early evening. He then showed up at dinner to make sure all was well.Our \"tent\" had a huge bed, flush toilet, sink & shower. We were lucky and able to have a private campsite, dinner, music & stargazing with story telling with Hassan our camel whisperer. We highly recommend this company for senior citizens or any age who are looking for a trip with a guide who will go out of their way to make sure you are having an enjoyable trip.Iddir owns the company and personally makes sure his guides (I think their are 5 total) fit the needs, language and interests of each client."

Our journey continued with more sightseeing and a night at an amazing quaint hotel called Chez Pierre tucked in the mountains of Dades Gorge and the restaurant dining was spectacular! The following day we headed to the Merzouga. On the way to the desert we stopped by to visit a local market, picked up some local pizza and were welcomed into his sisters families home to have our lunch. What a wonderful family! We left with very full stomachs! We continued on our drive and to our next destination where we rode camels into the Sahara desert and sat on the sand to watch the sunset. Our stay in the desert was an unforgettable experience with a night of great food, live music and star gazing. The next day we headed off to our final destination into Fez and we did a bit more sightseeing along the way. I highly recommend this tour and especially with Iddir!

During the four days we experienced the authentic side of Moroccan life; local markets, BBQ, \"Berber pizza\". Some of my favourite memories were of the spectacular scenery that we saw eg Atlas Mountains, the deserts, numerous valleys or going off road in his 4x4 and seeing different oases and Kasbahs. On the first day we did an excellent tour of Kasbah de bin haddou and would highly recommend it.The camel excursion and camping in the Sahara desert is one of those bucket list adventures.

We took a 3 night trip through the desert from Marrakesh. Iddir was very helpful and quick to respond during the booking process, and was very friendly and laid back the entire trip. He always was able to answer our questions, and was full of fun facts about the areas we drove through. The desert was amazing, and Iddir made sure to arrive at the perfect times with the best lighting, taking us around to various viewpoints to take our photos. A friend of Iddir gave us a tour around a local market in Rissani, which was so much different than the souks in Marrakesh! We were given a wealth of information in a spice shop, and were able to see the market from a local perspective - something that is still very memorable! We also had the chance to visit a local nomad store, where we were shown various authentic local craftsmanship, including beautiful rugs.All of the accommodation exceeded our expectations - absolutely beautiful! We never felt unsafe when we were with Iddir. We did not want to take the cinema tour in Ouarzazate, so he was even was able to take us (with our request) again to Ait Ben Haddou, where a guide led us on a hike through nearby meadows and rivers, giving us a view of the city many other tourists don't get.On the way home, we were suggested to a different restaurant than the usual place. This place was so off the beaten path that we had to have our order placed for us. There, we had some of the best tagine in all of Morocco, and a beautiful view, too! Would highly recommend this tour!"

Having spent nearly a month total in Morocco on 3 separate occasions this past year (and still planning to go back for more!), I can honestly say that the days I spent with Iddir and MMT each time were by far my favorite and most memorable. Of course he only has 5 star reviews. He is not capable of providing anything less. He will go far beyond what is necessary to ensure you not only have a marvelous and meticulously planned holiday, but also an authentic experience you remember your entire life. Morocco is a beautiful country with amazing people but, to a first timer especially, it can be quite intimidating and difficult to navigate if you do not speak the languages and do not have a car. Plan a trip with Iddir and you will not have to worry about these things and can just focus on having an amazing time with your friends and family and enjoy all the splendor Morocco has to offer!"

Iddir was extremely professional, accommodating and flexible in planning our trip.

We travelled 4 days and three nights with Mohammed from Fes to Marrakesh through the desert and all those incredible places. We got to see a lot, ask thousands of questions about the culture and life in Morocco and eat great fresh food. Mohammed made the trip very special for us and we even asked him to spend one more extra day to take us to Essaouira on our last day in Morocco. I expected a lot from this trip, but got so much more thanks to Mohammed and Iddir.You guys ROCK!"

I was skeptical of all the five star reviews on here and reading through the reviews there was a common theme - Iddir. Iddir runs marvelous Morocco tours and was also our guide for the 3day/2night trip from Marrakesh to Fes. He is knowledgable, personable, funny, and a joy to be around. You can tell Iddir has developed close relationships with the community as they all seem to know him and greet him warmly. What sets this tour apart from the rest is that it is an independent operator and they truly want you to have an authentic experience. We spoke with other travelers where their tour guides ended up taking them to visit an uncles shop or a workshop trying to sell souvenirs. Not once did Iddir take us anywhere commercial. Instead we visited a local market in Rissani to see how the villagers traded livestock, we visited caves where the nomads lived and would have had tea with if they hadn't moved on just a few days before, we pulled over to the side of a road to view fossils, we even had lunch with Iddir's sister and her family. Our time with Iddir was one of the highlights of this trip. He definitely deserves all those 5 star reviews. Shukraan Iddir! From Coffee and Tea!"

We had the pleasure of spending 5 days with our guide and owner of the company, Iddir, on a trip through the Atlas Mountains and Sahara desert from Marrakech to Fes. We stayed in 4 different places along the way and each and every hotel was perfect and more than anything we had expected. Iddir took care of everything; from picking us up at our Raid in Marrakech, keeping the days on schedule, planning for meals, relaxation, photo points, handling luggage, and to sharing a wealth of information on the places we were visiting and the cultures in Morocco. We especially loved the 2 days we got to spend in Merzouga and the Erg Chebbi Dunes. The camel trek was a blast and the accommodations both in the dunes and in Merzouga were fantastic! Spending the day with Iddir cruising around Merzouga was a highlight of our tour, as it is his hometown and readily shared what he loved about the desert with us. I could go on and on about how much fun we had and about the details of our trip, but to sum it up - it was a trip of a lifetime, book a trip with Marvelous Morocco Tours - and you won\u2019t regret it. Of our 3 weeks in Morocco, these 5 days were most definitely THE HIGHLIGHT of our trip. From the knowledge we gained, the stories we all shared, the good music while road tripping, and our new found friend and desert brother, Iddir, we felt absolutely lucky to have booked this trip and we are sure it won\u2019t be our last!"

The tour offers so much for a very reasonable price (we are students and it was perfectly affordable). The booking was uncomplicated and Iddir met all our requests. We did a private 4 days/3 nights Marrakesh to Marrakesh tour with a camel ride and one night in the desert. Our tour guide Youssef was a great guy and even spoke German very well. Our driver Ibrahim really made use of the 4x4 jeep and showed us spots we wouldn\u00b4t have seen on our own. We chose the cheaper price option that included middle-range hotels and all the hotels exceeded our expectations (pretty, clean, pool, etc.). Our personal highlight was the night in the sahara. There was a bonfire, berber music, shisha smoking and a beautiful night sky with countless starts. Iddir was not our guide but we met him along the way and he is a very nice, funny and relaxed guy. One day we were invited for lunch at his sisters house, she made couscous and berber pizza for us - another highlight for us!We loved Morocco and we will be back for another trip!"

I honestly cannot put into words how surreal this trip was. My girlfriends (5 in total) travelled with Iddir, our guide, on a 4 day trip through the Sahara (Marrakech to Fes). We travelled around in a beautiful Jeep which accomodated all five of us well. Although, I was a bit reluctant to travel to Morocco with a group of young girls, I cannot stress enough how safe and protected we felt throughout the entirety of the trip. Iddir, our guide, was one of the most welcoming, knowledgeable and fun tour guides I have ever experienced. He always made sure we were well looked after and experienced authentic Morocco. If you are thinking of doing a big trip... I would strongly recommend that you look into Marvelous Morocco Tours which is much more personal. Iddir and his colleagues will no doubt be able to show you a much more authentic, wholesome and inspiring Morocco. Iddir picked us up from our hostel in Marrakech and had everything carried through the busy streets to his Jeep which sat outside of the Medina. This is where we started our amazing trip. Some of the trips highlights included:- Atlas Mountain tours (snowball fights included)-Jeep rides through the Sahara (sitting on the outside of the jeep)-Ksar of Ait-Ben Haddou Day Trip-Gorges of Dades Day Trip-Authentic lunch with Iddir's family (The most amazing and welcoming family you could ever imagine)-Merzouga camel trek/camping overnight (bonfire under the stars)-Sandboarding in the Sahara -Constant food stops in the most authentic Moroccan areas-Beautiful, clean and unique hotels I don't even think this review does this trip enough justice. This will be a trip I remember for the rest of my life. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need further information."

I don't think we could have picked a kinder more helpful tourguide! Iddir went above and beyond multiple times to ensure we felt comfortable and at home during the entire tour. Unfortunately, our luggage was lost on the airplane on our way over to Morocco, Iddir took it upon himself to call the airport relentlessly for four days until we got our luggage back! During those four days he still provided us with incredible tours while he would continuously work at getting our luggage back. During some of the long car ride Iddir would entertain us with clever riddles and funny jokes, which made the time pass quickly! He would also pull off on the side of the road to show us a magic trick or even just to have a snowball fight in the mountains. He took us to see many amazing sites and also booked us to stay in some pretty awesome hotels. There is not one bad thing to say about this guy! When we were booking our trip we were a little surprised and skeptical to see that he only had perfect reviews on here, but after touring with him, I can say without a doubt he deserves every one of them! I would highly recommend anyone to go on a tour with him or his company!"

He was an incredibly safe driver and very courteous. He guided us through the excursion and was able to answer every question that we asked. The night in the desert was beyond compare!

Not to mention then night sky which to our delight they called \"Berber tv\"!

Iddir was an awesome guide: enthusiastic, funny, knowledgeable, and fluent in multiple languages (including English, French, Spanish, Berber, and Arabic). He took care of everything during our trip, including finding places to stay, making reservations at restaurants, securing transportation between different points, showing us around each stop on our itinerary, and hiring local guides as needed (e.g. for Fes and the Sahara). I don't normally book guides when traveling, but this was such a great experience that I wouldn't consider visiting Morocco without Iddir.OUR TRIP* 9 people* We visited Marrakech, Ait Benhaddou, Ouarzazate, Dades Valley, Merzouga/Sahara, Fes, and Essaouira over the course of a week.SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS* We booked our first night's riad (in Marrakech) without Iddir's guidance and had a relatively negative experience (no hot water in the showers, rude service, no breakfast). * By comparison, the riads that Iddir reserved for us were excellent (very good service, fantastic rooms, phenomenal food). * We found that many riads in Morocco have unanimous 5-star reviews on TripAdvisor whether they're good or not, so having Iddir's help finding the best places to stay was essential. The places that Iddir booked for us were also generally cheaper than the first riad we booked on our own, so we didn't pay a premium for the peace of mind.GETTING AROUND MOROCCO* Because of our group's size, Iddir secured a large van and a driver for our trip. The van was spacious and comfortable, and we didn't have any problems getting around easily.* There are random police checkpoints throughout Morocco, so having a guide who speaks Berber/Arabic and has the proper paperwork is a must. These checkpoints were not a problem at all with Iddir, but if our group had tried to rent a car and drive around Morocco ourselves, it would have been very stressful and maybe impossible.* Iddir was mindful of regularly stopping for bathroom breaks, making sure we had enough water, and ensuring we stopped at photogenic spots so we could take lots of photos :)* Along the way, Iddir also taught us about Morocco's history and culture, and was a generally cheerful and enthusiastic guide for the entire week, despite being stuck with the nine of us!* The drive between some points (e.g. Merzouga to Fes) can be quite long. This is unavoidable given how large Morocco is, but something to be aware of as you plan your itinerary. We actually didn't mind the long drives as it gave our group time to talk between points.HIGHLIGHTS* Morocco is so large and diverse that after 1 week we felt like we'd had a month's worth of experiences. From the gorges of the Dades Valley to the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara to the beaches of Essaouira, it's hard to believe we did so much in such a short period of time. * The overnight tour into the Sahara was truly astounding. I don't want to ruin it for anyone by divulging too many details, but suffice to say that this was the best part of our trip, which is saying a lot--if you come to Morocco, you MUST do this.* The riads Iddir booked were awesome--especially the riad in Dades and the Dar in Fes.* Iddir will make sure you get to fully experience the food and music of Morocco. Again, I don't want to ruin any surprises :)* The Medina in Fes has some fascinating history, and the local guide Iddir found for us was very friendly and informative.* At the end of our trip, we decided that we wanted to add Essaouira to our itinerary, and asked Iddir and the driver if they would be willing to extend the trip. They were very flexible and made this happen on virtually no notice, including finding us a place to stay and taking care of all logistics.* Morocco may be the most Instagrammable place on the planet. You're going to leave with a trove of unbelievable photos.GROUP SIZE* Iddir mentioned that he has had groups large and small (from solo travelers to groups with 50+ people). For our group of 9 people, we used a large van to drive around Morocco, but with a smaller group Iddir said he uses a 4x4."

Each hotel we stayed on at the tour was spectacular - everything was just perfect.I'm already planning my next trip back to Morocco and will certainly be going to Iddir to arrange the tour."

Four women, friends for over thirty years enjoyed a wonderful tour starting in Marrakesh and ending in Fes. Our guide was extremely knowledgable of the area, having grown up in the Sahara region and living in various regions of Morocco. Iddir took us over the Atlas mountains stopping at various nights along then way. A highlight of our trip was a camel ride into the Sahara and overnigting in a Berber camp. This was a fabulous way to visit regions of morocco with a true local! We sampled dates in Erfoud ( date capital), visited a fossil shop with its own quarry, listened to traditional Berber music, rode camels into the sunset and enjoyed many stops at beUtufl historic sights along then ay. At the same time we saw a large part of the Moroccan landscape in all its splendor. Marvelous Morocco Tours made our fist to morocco unforgettable!"

Having reviewed previous comments on trip advisor my friend and I decided that this was the tour we wanted to go on and Iddir didn't let us down. From the moment we contacted him to organise by email until the moment he dropped us off in Fes he couldn't have been more helpful and kind. He made the trip an amazing experience. From picking us up in our difficult to find Riad in Marrakech we headed off on our 3nights 4day Sahara adventure. The hotels we stayed in we're all lovely, even the tents in desert were very comfortable and nice. Iddir was very informative and fun he gave us the history of the towns and cities we passed through in the Atlas Mountains, and stopping were we wished for some photos. We even got the chance to meet some of his family which was really lovely. We also met a nomad family who were also very kind and gave us some Berber whisky ( tea!). The only downside to our trip was that we were sorry we didn't book a longer trip with Iddir to show us more of Morroco. So if you can I would recommend Marvelous Morocco tours to see as much of Morroco as you can - it's a great place Even when we finished our trip in Fes, Iddir dropped us an email to see how we were getting on and if we needed any guidance or recommendations. P.s don't play UNO with him... He cheats! Only messing it was great fun. Book it and enjoy :-)"

As a rule I have traveled independently and was at first not sure about the need for a tour. It was quickly apparent that this was the way to see the Morocco beyond the sites of the cities. We (a group of 4 friends) signed up for the 4 day 3 night tour beginning in Marrakech and ending in Fez. We had great opportunities to take (hundreds of) photos, visit extraordinary attractions, ride camels, hike dunes at sunset and sunrise. And just to talk and learn about this beautiful country.Iddir's enthusiasm, particularly for the desert area and nomad life was apparent from the beginning. And it was impossible to not be caught up in his passion for his land. He gave us time to enjoy our visit, while making sure we didn't miss anything along the way. The tour with Iddir felt more like a trip of discovery with a new Moroccan friend. I would enthusiastically recommend this tour to anyone thinking to visit Morocco."

Never thought I'd say it- but listen to your mother. I do have faith that we could have navigated Morocco sufficiently, however Iddir's tour optimised our time, and gave us the breathing space to truly enjoy the magnificent country that is Morocco.For any of you researching companies, I can vouch that I did too and by far this is the best I found. And not only has it lived up to my expectations, but it has also exceeded them. Iddir's passion for the country is so evident when speaking to him, and is was the quiet moments spent with him discussing nomadic customs in the desert that really felt authentic. Every company you will find can tick the sights off your list, but Iddir's authenticity and passion makes his company something truly special. Also, the flexibility is great! You want to go somewhere? No problem! You have a mother who wants to stop for photos every kilometre...sure thing! (Of course you still have to make it to the destination as I continually reminded my mum)Thankyou Iddir for a magical trip."

I went expecting to fall in love with the scenery and views. I left having fallen in love with the Berber people and culture. Prior to arriving in Morocco, I had emailed Iddir several times to plan the trip. His responses were always prompt, thorough, and friendly. It was a pleasure to finally meet him after so much communication leading up to the trip. Iddir had taken care of every detail of our tour. We felt incredibly welcome and did not have to worry about anything. In addition to his vast knowledge of Moroccan history and culture, Iddir kept us entertained with funny stories and riddles along the way. This was by far the most memorable trip I have taken - and I could not have planned it on my own. Iddir's expertise, relationships with other people along our journey, and welcoming presence are what made this trip so special. We truly felt like family by the end of our tour, and leaving Morocco was like saying goodbye to a dear friend. I will definitely be back again and will always trust Iddir to help me get the most out of my visits. I cannot recommend his services highly enough!"

            "review": "Truly, a trip of a lifetime.. My boyfriend and I finished our 11 day tour earlier this month with Ibrahim followed by Iddir, and it was absolutely the most memorable and wonderful experience. If you are looking for an authentic and truly welcoming tour of the insanely beautiful country that is Morocco, this is the team to guide you. The exceptional private tour is completely catered to you, and you are guided by a marvellous guide (who drives you in their spacious, comfortable vehicles) and they welcome you like family.It is the furthest thing away from the grossly overpacked buses of 30-40 people who are herded around like cattle from tourist trap to tourist trap (during our trip we even had others who were having an awful experience ask for the name of our driver and tour company).I could go on and on about how absolutely great this team is, so I'll try to keep it brief by providing some details and tips in point form:Planning- I started with a simple email, just letting them know we were looking for an 11 day tour on specific dates- I was provided 3 levels of accommodations to chose from, and we opted for the luxury accommodations as it was a special occasion (and if it is within your budget, do chose this option - it was like living like kings and queens, including staying at a riad that Bono stayed in at Fes)- After my obsessive combing of trip advisor forums and lonely planet guide books, I was ready to ask for some fairly specific stops - none of which I needed to say, because Iddir really truly has thought of everything, and is immensely experienced. He has planned more private tours than I ever hope for the rest of my entire life. (Basically, just trust in Iddir - he really knows what he is talking about, he has gone through his beautiful country upside down and sideways - trust his recommendations)- Before the trip, we had sent Iddir a nominal deposit via Western Union and paid the remainder when we met up with him.Logistics & Tips- Airport pick up and drop off - though our guided trip did not technically start until the day after we arrived, we booked the hotel through this team and it included airport pick up and drop off, which was immensely appreciated. It meant that we landed and did not have to stress out about haggling over taxi prices or struggling to find riads or anything of that sort. Very thoughtful detail.- Our trip was a one-way direction as, we arrived in Casablanca and departed in Marrakesh. If possible, try to do the same as to avoid losing precious time going back over the same sites you have already seen.- Our absolute favourite night was the night in the desert after our camel trek - if possible, do the two nights, you won't regret it. (Also, have a small bag/backpack as taking your gigantic airplane-sized luggage isn't really convenient on camels - you can leave your luggage safe and sound at the riad at the edge of the desert)- Best bit of advice? Try the BBQ! After a few days of eating couscous and tagine (though amazing and delicious) you will crave a little something else, and the BBQ places are to die for, amazing meat grilled to perfection. The guides will know which ones are best and worth going to.- If like me, you also intend to support the womens co-ops for the hand made goods from Morocco, trust your guides to recommend you to the right places. Some of the shops in especially the big city medinas are not so reliable - our one shopping tip we received was to buy the goods where you can see them being made, which was great advice.Regardless of if you have just a handful of days or a couple of weeks, you will be in great hands with Marvelous Morocco Tours.They will welcome you like an old friend, take you to the places off the beaten path that big tour buses cannot ever go to, and share with you more about their culture and country than you could ever learn from even a million online reviews.To Iddir and his team, a million thanks! Shukran & Sa-haa!"

Iddir, the passionate, knowledgeable and inspirational owner of this bespoke touring company, lead us on a fantastic trip though his diverse and interesting country. From the cities to mountains, from small villages to the beautiful desert country of his heart, Iddir was a font of knowledge and information who never tired of our questions or photo stops. He went out of his way to make sure we were happy, taking us to a mix of well-known sights and the less-worn paths, along the way educating us about Moroccan and Berber history and culture and keeping us entertained with his wry humour (and terrible jokes!) Iddir clearly greatly enjoys and cares deeply about what he does, and has great interest in and understanding of people, all of which mean his tours are unforgettable. In the words of my daughter \"Morocco wouldn't have been quite as awesome without Iddir\" I really did not want to leave and hope I will be able to come back again to spend more time in the desert with Iddir.

It was one of the best decisions we could have made. Iddir was very quick to respond with a customized itinerary and the price seemed very fair. We sent Iddir a deposit through Western Union before leaving to Morocco, and spent a few days in Marrakesh on our own before starting the tour. On the assigned day our tour guide Mohammed Maazouz showed up on time at our riad with a clean and comfortable SUV. I can't say enough nice things about Mohammed. Polite, kind, respectful, a good and safe driver, and so knowledgeable about Morocco. Mohammed is Berber and grew up in the Sahara desert. He entertained us with stories of his childhood as well as giving us historical information about the cities and sites we visited. Because it was just me and my partner and Mohammed traveling together, Mohammed was able to personalize our trip every day, asking us what types of sites we wanted to see, where and what we preferred to eat, and how much time we wanted to spend at each place. For example, one morning he asked us, \"What are you in the mood for today? There is a wonderful market we could stop at on the way to Merzouga if you are in the mood to shop, or if you prefer we could visit a salt mine or an abandoned casbah I know of that is off the track of most tours.\" When we wanted to buy souvenirs he was very helpful in advising us if things were a good price, or telling us to wait until the next city or market. He never pushed us to buy from any sellers.He took us a few times deep into the desert off the road to meet local berber families. This was probably the highlight of our trip as we were able to spend time with actual families in there homes, sharing tea and learning about their life in the desert. It was fascinating! We met other tourists in Fez that had been on similar group tours and they were surprised when we told them how wonderful and personal our tour had been. They described their tour as being a large group that was shuffled and hurried along from site to site and mediocre group meals. Our experience couldn't have been more different than that, and it seemed like they had paid a much higher price for their tour.Mohammed was always cheerful and pleasant to spend time with. I feel as if we not only had a wonderful guide, but also made a new friend."

Iddir was very kind, fun, easy to talk to, knowledgeable, and always happy to answer our questions and teach us about his wonderful culture. We did not plan any sites to see or places to stop but I have no regrets- Iddir knew exactly where to take us :) The camel ride through the desert and night in the Sahara was absolutely the most amazing once-in-a-lifetime experience and a must-do if you travel to Morocco!!! DEFINITELY book with Marvelous Morocco Tours- You will NOT be disappointed!!!"

He was very professional and all communication prior to the trip was great. A shared meal with his sister on the way to the desert portion of the trip was a great surprise. We want to come back to Morocco after this great introduction to a truly awesome part of the world! Thank you Iddir!"

            "review": "Excellent trip. My friends and I visited Morocco in February. We started our trip in Marrakech, where we beforehand booked a 3-day trip by email with Marvelous Morocco Tours and arranged all the detailes prior to our departure. The trip was excellent, Iddir is a great driver and tourist guide and always in a good mood. He was explaining us all the way and was trying to bring us Africa closer. We started our trip in Marrakech and passing Atlas to come to the other side, closer to the Sahara. We saw lots of very interesting places - everything as posted on their website. We spent the first night in a very nice hotel with great food. The next day we continued exploring the other side of Atlas. Iddir prepared one very nice surprise - a lunch at his sister's house which made the trip even more familiar. and the whole experience more authentic. We finally arrived to the trekking point. Probably one of the best parts of the trip, riding kamels in beautiful Sahara. The berber camp is also fantastic: very well equiped (water, showers, european toilets and one or two bedroom tents). We had dinner there and then the berber party. The third day we were trying to get to Fes. However due to some bad weather (snow in Atlas) we spent the night in a hotel in the middle of Atlas (all arranged by Iddir) and the next day we arrived to Fes. I can definitely recommend this trip - it is worth the price. You get what you pay."

I found Iddir through Trip Advisor and our time with him was well worth it. We didn't have an agenda and hadn't done much research and just let Iddir lead the way. The SUV was very comfortable and Iddir told us about the towns as we passed through each of them. One major highlight for me is that he took us to his sister's house for lunch. It was a great way to really get a glimpse of local life and the meal we had there was an AMAZING Berber pizza. Seriously, I wish I could get that in the states. In hindsight, something I would recommend ,and will keep in mind for next time, would be to do a little more research so I could tailor my trip to the types of things I like to do. For example, we were driving through a town on a day when they happen to have their local outdoor market so I asked if we could visit it. Iddir was happy to oblige and I'm glad I got to see it.Marvelous Morocco Tours was really a great way to be introduced to the desert!"

The camel trek they set up was awesome as well. They even took us to a local fish market and helped us order firsh, have it prepared, and eat like the locals!Overal, it was a great trip!

As a seasoned traveler, I have experienced some truly wonderful guides and some insanely terrible guides - Our tour guide, Iddir, was the best guide anyone could even possibly imagine.My friend and I, both females in our mid-20's, decided to go to Morocco for a last minute holiday tour. From the get-go, Iddir was extremely responsive to our emails never letting our questions go unanswered. This was a clear sign of the great experience we were to have.Upon arrival, Iddir was prompt and on time to pick us up from the airport so that we did not have to wait. He then communicated to us our plans for the day. He moved efficiently through our day so that we could maximize the amount we saw. Iddir knew exactly the best places to stop to take pictures without us having to even ask. As we were settling into our lodging accommodations, Iddir was always there to ensure that we were happy with our room and would go out of his way to find us a new room if there was something we would have preferred. He kept our preference in mind as the tour proceeded.There is a clear passion Iddir shows for his work as he deeply cares for the enjoyment of the tourists. He was extremely attentive and never let a request go unanswered.Prior to enlisting with the tour, my friend and I worried that if we were joining a tour, we would not have enough time to explore the cities by ourselves. Need not worry! Iddir's tours are completely customize-able and allows time for tourists to go and discover the city on their own if they please.Traveling with Iddir was a magnificent experience as it almost seemed like we were on a road trip with a lifetime friend - who happened to be extremely knowledgeable. Iddir is perfect for all ages as he is timely, professional, and communicates well. My friend and I never had to ask Iddir for our plans as Iddir made the initiative to inform us what we would be doing and what we may need.Marvelous Morocco Tours (MMT) made our trip go extremely smoothly. Never once were my friend and I stressed, worried, or unhappy with any of the accommodations, plans, or communications. We had originally thought we could plan a trip around Morocco, but after experiencing the tour with MMT, we realized that we could never have planned a trip like the tour. Nor would the trip have been the same without Iddir.I only wish I had more friends to refer to MMT.Also, Iddir knows where the best couscous is."

Comfortably sitting in the back of his 4wd vehicle we were up, up, up into the Atlas mountains. Iddir shared his vast knowledge of his country with us. Since he was born in these mountains it was extensive. As a Berber who grew up in the area we were traveling in he knew it all and shared his knowledge with us. We definitely got the insiders view. Being alone we could ask to stop when we wanted and ask to see places not on the itinerary, too. The highlights of the trip for me were visiting a nomad dwelling in a cave really far removed from everything and everyone then another nomad family in a tent in the desert, having a lovely couscous lunch in the home of Iddir's sister, and the icing on the cake was camping in the sand dunes after riding in by camel. If you are fortunate enough to have the opportunity to do this trip, do it. You will not regret having gone."

The trip was well coordinated. The Toyota (or Japanese camel) was new and our driver, Abraham was very skilled. Our lodgings were clean and comfortable, especially the lavish desert tents complete with traditional rugs and real beds! For dinner we lounged on silk pillows and ate delicious foods. ****SUGGESTIONS FOR TRAVELERS:START and END IN DIFFERENT CITIES- The tours offered in Morocco involve quite a bit of driving, I would suggest starting in one city and ending in another to avoid repetition.BRING STOMACH MEDICINE FROM HOME- The chances of getting food poisoning in Morocco are higher than in other countries. Bring pepto bismol, Imodium etc. Also meds for motion sickness as the roads can be quite curvy. Unfortunately my friends and I did get sick from some food we ate in Marrakesh\u2019s main plaza and we were unprepared.BRING- Sunscreen, small flashlight, wetwipes, good walking shoes and comfortable pants for the camel trek.Once again we thank Iddir and Abraham for a wonderful experience. We are lucky to have met such nice people who are eager to share their traditions, culture, and history with travelers."

Morocco Explored organised our whole week in Morocco.They booked all our accommodation,organised drivers & local guides for us.We planned an itinerary with them in advance which suited us.Our driver,Hicham, met us at the airport & took us to our amazing Riad in Marrakech where they welcomes us with mint tea although it was 10.30 at night.Early next morning Hicham collected us & we set off across the Atlas mountains,Hicham was really friendly & we learned so much about the country from him. He was always punctual & polite.He found us great places to stop for a break/lunch and allowed us to be flexible with the itinerary as we went along.We did spend a lot of time in the car those first few days - more than we had expected but it was worth it to do the camel ride out into the Sahara. We slept out in the open air overnight & trekking back as the sun rose was an amazing experience. Our camel guides were really friendly & took lots of photos of us all - they even made a video on our phone set to music.The children really enjoyed the Fossil museum - only a small place but the guide was really knowledgeable & we all learned a lot.We stayed at Ait Benhaddou on the way back. Hicham gave us a tour of the old kasbah which was interesting, including a visit to a Berber household.Back in Marrakesch we stayed at the beautiful Riad Manissa in the medina. Nothing was too much trouble for them - we had our breakfasts on the rooftop terrace overlooking the city. We ate there one night & they cooked a local speciality which we hadn't seen on any restaurant menu which was delicious.Morocco Explored had arranged a walking tour for us which we we really glad of as it included historic palaces &going round the souks, taking us to parts of the city we probably wouldn't have ventured on our own.The children were a bit uncomfortable in Marrakech without the guide - the constant hassling to come into a shop & jumping out of the way of the motorbikes in the narrow streets.One night we ate on upper terrace of one of the cafes overlooking the main square - from here we could see everything that was going on without the hassle.Next day a different driver picked us up & took us to Essaouira at the coast. Again we had a lovely Riad in the medina.The pace here was much more laid back than Marrakech & we had an enjoyable couple of days wandering the narrow streets & did a lot more shopping thereAll the drivers/ guides we had with Morocco Explored were punctual & helpful and we stayed in some lovely places. A really good trip"

We found Morocco Explored through Trip Advisor \u2014 we sent out inquiries to three companies and Robbin at Morocco Explored was always prompt in replies and with complete information, plus their website is full of good information while preparing for your trip. We had 7 days of our trip in Morocco arranged through Morocco Explored. Our driver Miloud was excellent. He was always prompt and in good humor, the car was clean each morning, he would answer any question we asked, and he knew where the clean bathrooms are!We took the advice of other reviewers and opted for 4* accommodations and we were glad we did. Most of the riads were excellent, but one of the riads arranged for us was disappointing and we did not feel it was the same quality as the other 4*\u2019s we stayed at plus both of us got sick here and we had to cancel our camel ride to the desert camp the next day. That was disappointing, but we don\u2019t fault the tour company (and we have told Robbin our experience). We had read the warnings about not eating raw vegetables and we shouldn\u2019t have let our guard down. We had to take a financial hit since we cancelled the day of the camel ride, but Robbin worked with us to find alternate lodging when we opted to cancel the desert portion and drive directly to Fes. A comment I would make is we underestimated the distances between places and we spent too much time in the car. We wanted to end our trip in Essaouira so we did a round trip from Marrakech, Dades Valley, Fes, Ouzoud, Essaouira. If it\u2019s possible, it would be better to fly into Fes and out of Marrakech or Essaouira (FYI you can fly directly from Essaouira to either London or Paris, 2 days a week). Essaouira is a great place to end your trip because it is more laid back and on the ocean. And we had a day and a half in Fes but I wished we had had another day there.Morocco Explored was easy to work with and let us make various adjustments to their basic tour. They also sent out a questionnaire 2-3 weeks after our trip asking for feedback. I appreciated that they waited for us to get readjusted back home and that they wanted feedback on how to improve. We would recommend this company."

This memorable experience would not have been possible if it wasn't for Morocco Explored and our wonderful driver Hicham. What was fantastic for us was that the trip was organised for us. Having a transfer to and from the airport reduces any transport stress. Our flight was slightly delayed but our driver was happily waiting for us as we came out. From the first time we met Hicham, he was friendly, patient, excited and full of knowledge. Throughout the ten days, Hicham dealt with our constant questions, car sickness, our sleeping in the car, our wonderful singing as well as our never ending complaining about how hot it was. It did not take long before Hicham became not just our driver/guide but also our friend. It was so nice to learn about the Moroccan (and Berber) culture from a local as well as to share with him our own cultures (Mexican and Australian). Hicham is full of knowledge about this beautiful country and has a strong passion when it comes to sharing all the beauties of it. Our tour started and ended in Marrakech. There was a lot of time spent in the car but that was of course expected because of the distances we were travelling. The tour was well organised and the sites that we visited were definitely worth it. Hicham always new the best places to stop for a view or to visit nomad families. He also stopped for us in a shop where we could try on traditional Berber outfits and take a photo. There was absolutely no expectation for us to buy anything. Missing the camel and overnight experience in the Sahara would be a big mistake. This was one of the highlights of our trip. The nomad guides (Mustafa) were friendly and the hotel Yasmina gave us a room to leave our luggage and shower in before and after the night in the desert. We enjoyed a lovely beef Tagine in the desert and listened to music played by the local nomads. What was also amazing, was sleeping outside and waking up in the middle of the night and seeing the sky full of stars. We will never forget this experience.One of our favourite places was Ait Ben Haddou where we visited a Kasbah which is a world heritage site and also where many movies have been filmed. It was absolutely beautiful. The best time toVisit it is first thing in the morning in order to get some amazing photos without the rest of the tourists. The entry was cheap and it was great having Hicham there with us to explain some of the history. The waterfalls in ouzoud were also very beautiful. You do not need a large amount of time there but they are for sure worth the visit. Marrakech was lovely but we found it very full on with people constantly trying to get you into their shops to sell you things. Be sure to say no from the beginning if you are not interested. This is something we learnt a little bit too late. 1 or 2 days is for sure enough in Marrakech. The local tour guide showed us some great places and was able to give us some information about the sites. A bit more historic explanation would have been good. The questions we didn't get answered during our city tour got answered later nicely in the way to the beach by our driver Hicham. We can recommend a lovely restaurant near the main square called Naranj. The owners speak Arabic, English, German and a few other languages. At one stage we needed a break from Tagines and went to a burger place called 'Burger Beats' which is run by a French guy. Each day we stopped at a lovely place for lunch. The food was always yummy, good service and the restaurants were clean. Our favourite lunch stop was in a local place. When finding out we were happy to eat in a local place, Hicham took us to a great local restaurant were we had grilled meat and tea. We even ate it like locals (with our hands). The last place we went to was Essouira. It was so nice to have two full days here where we could get a massage, relax, walk around and enjoy the beach. The fishing port was very crazy and interesting. The medina here was beautiful and a lot less hectic than the one in Marrakech. We found this town to be a lot more peaceful. There is a lot of fresh seafood and some great places to eat. It was pretty cool seeing goats in an argan tree on the way to Essouria. Hicham was also flexible and understanding. One day we were just too tired to visit the last site for the day so he made sure we could see it in the morning. He also made sure to fit in particular things that we had an interest in e.g. Olive groves. Morocco explored was also fantastic when it came to booking the tour. Robbin was understanding and did everything she could to make the best possible tour to fit our dates. Even when I made a big mistake and had told her the wrong arrival date from the beginning. She quickly re booked our hotels and added in an extra day in Essaouria. The hotels were all very nice and clean. The breakfasts were always good and the dinners that we had included were also very yummy. Our favourite was the Kefta Tagine at the hotel Riad Ouzoud. Sometimes we wished we could stay longer in a particular hotel just because it was so nice and the staff were so friendly.When it came to the foods we ate, we never really had any problems. Everything was fresh and delicious. My favourite Tagine was Kefta. I had it a few times. Just be careful about ensuring that the hotels serve you bottled water and not tap water that they have put in a bottle. Our overall Morocco experience was amazing. Even though we visited so much there is still so much for us to see. I think the hardest thing for us was knowing what to tip when in a restaurant or taking a photo etc. this is something that we also looked to our Morocco explored driver/ guide to assist us in. Thank you Morocco explored and Hicham for such an amazing Moroccan experience. We really can't thank you enough for the fantastic ten days we had. We highly recommend Hicham and Morocco Explored to any other travellers looking for an organised tour in Morocco.Christine (Australian) and Rolando (Mexican)."

I didn't know that you have to cross the Atlas mountains to get to the Sahara. This was a spectacular activity for us. We stopped to look at historical and natural features along the way. Our camel guide, Mohammed led us ithrough the Sahara for about two hours. Although riding a camel kind of hurts, you don't notice it because you're overwhelmed by being in the actual Sahara desert. It was so beautiful and quiet. We went to a camp where we met two other families from Spain. We ate dinner, sang songs, the guides played the drums, we danced and slept under the stars. We had tents to sleep in, but our guides brought our beds outside so we wouldn't be too hot. I woke up during the night and looked at the sky. It was gorgeous. An explosion of stars against a black sky. The next morning, while it was still dark, we got back on our camels and rode to the hotel where we started. We had breakfast and took a shower. Then we were on our way back to Marrakech.This was the best adventure I've ever had on a trip. If you can, don't miss this opportunity."

Ahmed, managed to find us a bottle of freshly squeezed orange juice before any of the stands were open. After a few hours of napping, my wife and I awoke to the sight of a beautiful canyon where we stopped for lunch overlooking radically different scenery than what we had been used to over the past week caught in the hustle and bustle of the city. On our way, Ahmed continued to share his seemingly never ending knowledge of Moroccan and Berber history. Next stop in a tiny village, we visited the Kasbah of Ksar Ait Ben Haddou. a very large earthen clay village composed of kasbahs, and individual forts where people lived off the land. Ahmed taught us about building practices and how the people kept their little town safe from intruders during times of unrest in the area. We continued on, passing by village after village of beautiful buildings and desert landscapes. Ahmed had something to say about almost everything we passed. Towards the end of the day, we stopped off in yet another small town, where Ahmed was born and raised. He asked if we minded that we stop off so that he could see his mother and a newborn child in his family. My wife and I were very warmly welcomed with mint tea and snacks. It is customary that when a Berber woman has a child, that all the nearby women stop by to delivery gifts and to pass along blessings to the the child and family. We sat in a circle with women dressed in traditional scarfs and colorful clothing as they laughed and spoke amongst themselves in their native tongue. We didn't understand a lick of it but there was love in their voices. Sitting in this circle with these people was such a magical moment. The warmth and gratitude they had for us and each other was beaming from their laughter and smiles. On our way out, it began to rain, an omen that we were in the right place. We arrived at our riad in Tinghir to a delicious dinner.The next morning, Ahmed made sure we were set up with our guide and our breakfast, full of breads, jams, yoghurt, hard boiled eggs, tea, coffee and orange juice. We walked around town with a local guide who showed us irrigation systems, traditional farming practices and how to make Moroccan rugs. Next stop, the beautiful Dades Gorge, a steep valley cut by a river in the Atlas Mountains. Red rock walls climbing into the air from either side. We developed a flourishing rapport with Ahmed as he is a very charming and knowledgable man. He stopped whenever we wanted to take a picture, and continuously surprised us with drops of knowledge at every corner. He found us a great deal on beautiful cotton scarves, as I wanted them and we'd need them for our camel trek. We took a left turn down a dirt road and drove for what seemed like far too long for any type of reasonable civilization to exist, but alas! A desert oasis hotel with a pool. We unloaded our things, relaxed in the cool water for a bit, and then out for our camel ride. Slowly swaying through the milky dunes, our guide walked us for an hour and a half during sundown, taking photos and videos and teaching us the fundamental survival practices of the nomadic Berbers. We arrived right before nightfall to be greeted by two more gentlemen. They showed us to our tent, where we changed, for the evening, and came back to sit on beautiful rugs while we drank more mint tea and waited for our Tagine to be prepared. After dinner, we played drums and sang Berber songs. Drum circles kind of drive me crazy, but this one was pretty fun. It was very hot so my wife and I decided to sleep under the stars. It was such a beautiful night. The warm wind on our skin was cooled by a gentle rain. It felt incredible. We awoke before sun up to take our camels back to the hotel to carry on. The trek back was even more beautiful as we watched the day begin. We arrived back to our hotel where Ahmed was waiting to pour our tea and to inform us with the day's plan. we packed up and headed out for our drive to fez. We stopped for lunch at another unreasonably desolate village where I had my favorite Moroccan meal. We were dumbfounded as to how it was possible to keep the produce so fresh in the middle of a desert with such presumably infrequent customer visits. I don't know how this restaurant did it, but it was delicious. Through the mountains we drove through what looked like a European countryside; much like France or Italy. I had no idea that the Moroccan landscape was so diverse. In a pine forest, Ahemd took us to a place where wild monkeys roamed about eating food that tourists fed them. I realize that these aren't probably the most humane ways to treat animals, as bread isn't part of their natural diet, but neither is pollution, and these guys are hungry and seemed happy to be interacting with people.We finally arrive in Fez, where one of Ahmed's friends helps us to find our riad. We are settled in now and are on to the next journey. All in all, the adventure was worth every dollar. Essalah, who arranged everything was very responsive and helpful for the weeks preceding the trip. Ahmed was an incredible driver and guide, and we now consider him a friend and will continue to be in contact.Morocco has some of the most beautiful people I have ever met. Strongly recommended."

One change would have been toI wish ask for 4 star accommodations instead of 3 star. But we managed with what was booked for us. We loved the food and ate everything and thus ended up with some stomach issues but this was not the fault of the tour company. What is nice about this travel agency is that they can really plan whatever itinerary you would like to have. On the last day the owner of the agency drove us from Fez to Casablanca and we were able to get another point of view we would not otherwise have had. So while the trip was certainly not a luxury trip we learned so much about their culture, people, customs, religion and geography and experienced so many different things that it is a trip we will never forget.Our favorite experiences were the camel ride into the sahara/sleeping under the stars and our 2 nights in Fez. We loved Fez and hands down is a do not miss."

In a sentence; this tour was an amazing way to see the wide variety of landscapes and culture Morocco has to offer at the expense of long driving days.We selected the 4 day 3 night Camel Tour and our overall experience was very positive. Can easily say that our expectations were met and exceeded. The tour allows you to see a variety of places and can be altered to fit your personal tastes. Our driver, Hamou, was very knowledgeable and offered great details and insights into Moroccan culture and history. His English was very good, although there were a few instances where we had misunderstandings. He made a constant effort to ensure our comfort. Our excursion into the Desert, what we were looking forward to the most, was incredible despite the camp being underwhelming. Our guides were very impressive and riding the camels was really fun. Definitely a bucket list experience. While our overall experience was positive there were a few drawbacks. The desert is approx 700 km away from Marrakech so prepare yourself for lots of driving. You see a lot as you drive and stops can be as frequent as you like, but it's a lot of driving. We would recommend the 5 day 4 night tour simply to reduce the driving each day. Also, We would say the upgrade to 4 stars would be good. Our third nights accommodation was spacious but uncomfortable and the food was subpar. Prepare yourself for a similar menu of food each day, but you can explore other food options during lunch.If I could give 4.5 of 5 I would and will recommend this company to our friends and family with the above mentioned alterations in mind."

From the correspondence to arrange the trip, coordinate payment and deal with logistics changes (thanks to the unexpected weather - flooding!) with Robin and Salah, and on the ground experience with our assigned guide and driver Khaled Ezzai, Morocco Explored made everything easy and enjoyable! I can\u2019t say enough good things about Khaled, if you book a tour through Morocco explored I highly recommend you ask for him to be your guide. To give you an example, we were in Morocco in late November/December 2014 just as the country was hit with torrential rains that caused widespread damage to roads and buildings. We tried the normal roads to get out of Marrakesh and through to Skoura only to find them blocked as the road along the Tichka pass has been damaged and had been closed by the authorities. We heard from other tourists later on whose guides eventually told them they would have to turn back to Marrakesh and they lost days of their trip waiting for the pass to open. But not Khalid, he came up with a plan to go by an alternate route that took us further north, and while it would require driving late into the evening, it would get us to our destination and still allow us to cover all the items we wanted to see in the next 4 days. This is just one example of what a great problem solver he is and how he thinks outside the box. We had 4 people in our group, two vegetarians, one person with gluten allergies, and one person sick with a stomach bug caught earlier in Marakesh before we started the tour. He helped us make sure that wherever we stopped everyone had food options to meet their needs. In another event he went out of his way to contact a hotel we had booked independently of Morocco Explored in Ait Benhaddou (where he was supposed to leave us) and found the hotel had been damaged by the rains and tourists were not being allowed into the old Kasbah where the hotel was and Khaled quickly helped us arrange for an alternate hotel (and sure enough when we got to Ait BenHaddou the entrance was blocked off by local police who would not let any tourists go in ). Khaled helped us tailor the daily itinerary based on things he could see we liked and didn\u2019t like and was very flexible if we asked to change something on the fly. We found Khaled to be a very personable and friendly guide and with his patient demeanor and ready smile (not to mention witty sense of humor) he is easy to be around. It felt like he really wanted us to see and get to know Morocco and he provided local perspective on Moroccan history and current events, and challenges facing Morocco. I hope we have the opportunity to return to Morrocco again and when I do I will definitely use Morrocco Explored and ask for Khaled Izzay as our guide !"

We were met by our driver at our Riad in Marrakesh and walked to the main square where we met the Marrakesh manager and got into our van. We had a long day of driving and saw many nice sights. Our driver took us to one Kasbah and encouraged us to look around, which we did. After we started looking around he told us that it would cost us 20 MDH per person. We paid this as we left but as we drove away I looked up the Kasbah in our guidebook and it said there was no fee. We then continued on to Ait Ben Haddou and got to our hotel there which had been booked by Morocco Explored. The rooms were quite cold but otherwise nicely laid out and they provided plenty of blankets to keep us warm. We were told at dinner that our driver was being replaced for the next day. We met the new driver and talked a bit about what to expect. The second driver, Miloud, spoke better English and excellent Spanish. He was very helpful throughout the rest of our trip. We had a beautiful drive on both day 2 and day 3 and got the the desert in time for the sunset. Unfortunately, throughout our adventure the oldest member of our group was feeling unwell. Miloud kept track of this and helped us explore other options as we needed them such as finding a pharmacy, or letting him stay in the van while the rest of us went exploring. When we went into the desert, the combination of the camel walk and the sickness were overwhelming for our sick member and the camel driver had to manage a difficult situation which he handled quite well and with dignity for all involved. The night in the camp was cold and beautiful. I would highly recommend it. The children loved every moment of the camel ride and camp evening and morning and they barely complained at all about the cold. Day 4 was mostly driving to Fez but was still a good journey and broken up at regular intervals by Miloud to show us interesting villages and forests on the way back. Lunch was fabulous on the last day and we were sad to say goodbye to our adventure."

Morocco Explored is a professional tour agency that provides quality of service.We took their four day 3 night tour and found the itinerary to be the overview of Morocco that we were hoping for. Their pretravel information about the tour and trraveling in Morocco in general is complete and very helpful.Our guide Mohamed Amine Nasraoui was knowledgeable and extremely competent . Not only was he a fount of facts about Morocco but he went the extra mile to insure our comfort and safety. He wanted us to see Morocco through his eyes and love it as much as he does. Request him for your guide. You will not be disappointed. Susan"

We were collected from Fez by Miloud, our driver, and he made the trip so much more interesting than if we had simply hired a car. He took us through the Atlas mountains, stopping off along the way. Highlights were the camel trek into the desert - 'touching the stars' from the top of the highest sand dune ever - my daughter learning to play the drums with Miloud and his colleagues - too many to mention really! Miloud was very knowledgeable about his country - could speak an amazing number of langauges and was always so happy to answer our questions. He is a credit to Morocco Explored - he made our first trip to Morocco one to remember!"

It would have been so easy to have been put off by the detail that the company wanted when booking, even at some points wondering why they wanted certain information, but persist it is indicative of their attention to detail. Our trip out of Marrakech into the High Atlas was stunning and although it was a long day we would not have missed anything out. Ruined Kasbahs, Berber villages, world heritage site, unbelievable series of hairpin bends up and over the mountain passes and a really well informed and helpful driver. Excellent !"

Our tour guide was sick on the day of our tour so instead the company manager stepped in and guided us for our day trip to Ait Benhaddou and that was simply a big blessing to us because he had a one year old baby to be understanding of our family's needs. We have three kids, 8 yr, 6 yr, and 22 months and it was a very long trip considering we had to stop multiple times for potty breaks, diaper change, baby crying because she was car sick and hurt from the morning fall at the riad and baby throwing up... Needless to say, even though it was a long trip (we left around 8:30 am and returned close to 9 pm) but our guide was so kind, patient and cheerful that it made our trip all the better. Our kids said it well, \"He is the best tour guide ever!!\" And Ait Benhaddou is so beautiful and special. Be prepared with motion sickness medicine because the road is super windy."

We enjoyed his company so much, we actually hired him to drive us for the rest of our time in Morroco - to/from Essaouria and back to Casablanca for our flight. The tour was excellent. We left Fes and saw the Sahara on camels, slept in tents, visits the oldest Nomad Souk in Morocco and walked through the Kasbah at Ait Ben Haddou (where they filmed gladiator and game of thrones), among many many other stops. Mohammed was excellent and we would highly recommend this tour if you are looking to really experience an authentic feel of Morocco."

It's a good 2-3 hour drive, but it's worth it to see the slowly unfolding foothills and landscape outside Marrakesh, and then to experience the second highest waterfalls in Africa. Or so,our very knowledgeable and chatty guide told us. His name was Samir, he had studied English literature at the University, was of Berber heritage, and was a mine of information, political, historical, geological, and spoke 4 languages fluently. Take swimming gear, he pools are deliciously cool and there are places to swim and make ridiculous jumps from, which seems to be a local speciality that the tourists also indulge in. It is used by Moroccans and tourists so doesn't feel like it's for Western use only which I really liked. There are cafes all along, so choose the one you like the look of, expect to climb a bit, but there are steps and pathways so you don't need hiking boots- I wore Birkenstocks and was fine. It is really spectacular when you get to the highest fall, here's the sound of the water and cool spray, it's wonderful. It was a full-on day, 8am- 7pm, tiring but good fun."

Firstly dealing with Robbin to organise the itinerary for the tour was a breeze. Her responses where always prompt and the information pack she sent was really helpful. And then meeting Esallah, who picked us up from the Airport. He was a delight and so friendly.We started in Marrakech, for couple of days where we were on our own to explore the exciting and bustling medina. We then took off for the touring part, where we met our driver Hicham. This is when the real experience of exploring Morocco began, We had our itinerary set for the tour but Hicham gave us lots of options of places to visit along the way, some were optional and some he said was a must, and he wasn't wrong. Hicham took us to his town, where we were lucky enough to have lunch with his family. He was so knowledgeable about every place we visited and so proud of his Berber heritage. We cannot speak highly enough of Hicham, he made our time in Morocco so much richer and we felt we got to see the heart of the country, we will never forget this holiday. All the Riads we stayed in were of a very high standand and the breakfasts were so delicious. The Riad in Fes was definitely the highlight. Our trip was amazing and we would recommend Moroccan Explored to everyone. And hopefully they are lucky enough to meet Hicham. We can't wait to return and spend so much more time exploring this magical country! Thank you so much!"

We booked a 3 day trip that started in Marrakech, traveled to the Erg Chebbi dunes (with a TON of awesome stops along the way), and then finished with a long stretch on to Fes. Our guide was exceptionally friendly and welcoming, and we had many wonderful conversations during the drives. My wife visited several other countries (in Europe) during our month-long trip, and every time we were on a train or bus riding through the countryside, it felt incomplete without Mohammed's commentary - always something about what kind of history happened in this city, or how many people lived there, or what kind of crops primarily grew in the area. We were truly spoiled! And Mohammed introduced us to the Moroccan and Islamic cultures as well, really giving us a personal connection with the country and its people.Oh, and for what it's worth, he pointed us towards the most delicious restaurants, and we stayed in amazing hotels/riads!"

The planning of the trip was very simple and easy as their website had lots of information. Any questions that we had were answered quickly. Then the fun began!!!! We booked the 12 night tour of Morocco starting and ending in Marrakech. Our itinerary was great and it did include a couple of long days in the car.Our driver, Miloud, was fantastic!!!! He took excellent care of us during the entire trip and we always felt safe. His English skills were very good and he was able to give us lots of information along the way. Miloud was a very safe driver....Moroccan driving can get a bit crazy but not with Miloud!!!! Miloud's personality was very pleasant and he fit in very nicely with our family of 4. Thanks goodness, as we spent 13 days with him! Miloud had a great sense of humour! He had lots of suggestions as to where to stop for lunch a long the way and they were some of the best meals we had!!!!Our accommodations throughout the trip were very nice! Mostly riads with a couple of hotels thrown in. We loved Ksar Anika in Marrakech, Kasbah Ighnda in Ait Benhaddou, and Auberge Yasmina in the desert.Now the desert experience!!! We LOVED it! Our guide, Addi, made the experience truly memorable! It was VERY hot but sleeping out of the tent under the stars made it manageable. Dinner was a yummy~chicken tagine, veggies and fruit with music by Addi! Addi took lots of video and photos with our Iphone and we will treasure the photos.Overall, thanks Miloud and Morocco Explored for a wonderful holiday!!!!"

I initially tried to plan it all myself, book hotels, identify sights to see, etc, but we did not want to rent a car and drive ourselves (despite being fairly adventurous and French-speaking) and we couldn't get everywhere we wanted to go by train. I found the reviews for Morocco Explored, sent an email describing our timeframe and rough itinerary, and in a matter of hours had a very thorough response from them with a detailed itinerary and price! They customized a private tour for us and our two teenage children, and the price was very reasonable. The info they send is very comprehensive, including my two favorite sections: \"What is included\" and \"What isn't included\". So, no surprises. Follow-up questions were answered promptly.I can't say enough about what an easy, safe, and hassle-free way this is to see a lot of the country with very little stress. The tour was door-to-door, with pickup at our Marrakesh hotel and drop-off at our destination hotel in Fes a few days later. Our driver/guide, Miloud, was fantastic and was with us every step of the way. There is no haggling with cab drivers, no getting lost, no surprise upcharge at the hotel, etc. It's all very smooth and everything is pre-arranged. [One note - the standard hotels used by Morocco Explored are charming, safe, clean, and have great food. But they are not luxurious.] Miloud was a very competent and even somewhat conservative driver, so that was great. Morocco is a spectacular country; we saw the Atlas mountains, Ait Benhaddou, Ourzazate, Boumalne Dades (the Dades Valley was one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen), Tinehir, the Todra Gorges, Azrou and Volubilis. We saw the dunes of the Sahara, went on a camel trek, slept in tents on the dunes, had dinner with Berber camel guides, and watched the sunrise over the dunes. Thanks to Morocco Explored we did all that with all fun and no stress!"

From the beginning of our interaction with Essalah, we received excellent customer service. He met us in person in Marrakech to discuss the details of the trip and explained each aspect of the tour. After our meeting, he was nice enough to drive us to Jardin Marjorelle and gave us recommendations on additional sights throughout Marrekech (despite the fact that we had not yet definitively booked our tour). Our trip was simply phenomenal. As other reviewers have stated, the scenery and people are stunning. Essalah served as our English speaking guide and driver as no other driver was available. He was charming and incredibly knowledgeable and allowed us plenty of time to stop throughout. All of the accommodations and food were excellent. Essalah was kind enough to coordinate a separate guide during our stay in Fez who was also wonderful. I went on to travel alone to Assilah and Essalah booked my stay there at another beautiful riad.

            "review": "Exploring Morocco with Morocco Explored. We recently spent 12 days on a private \u201cgrand tour\u201d of Morocco with Morocco Explored. Morocco being the amazing place it is, overall we were happy with our trip. We were often pleased with Morocco Explored\u2019s service, occasionally very pleased, and, in one very important respect, very disappointed. \u2022 Pre-trip: Morocco Explored has a representative in North America, which made communication easy. She answered emails promptly and was very informative. Unfortunately, once we arrived in Morocco we found discrepancies between pre-trip representations and what actually took place in country (see below). \u2022 The itinerary: our itinerary was planned to help us explore Morocco. (Casablanca \u2013 Chefchaouen \u2013 Volubilis \u2013 Fez \u2013 Camel caravan with a night sleeping in the desert under a nomad tent \u2013 Tinehir, Ait ben Haddou, Marakkesh, Essaouira.) It was very comprehensive and allowed us to fully experience the country\u2019s beauty and cultural diversity. Be aware, however, that in order to complete the circuit in a limited amount of time, there will be some long days of travel where you will be able to view the country\u2019s amazing, ever-changing landscape from your car but not spend appreciable amounts of time outside of it.\u2022 The accommodations: We were very pleased with the accommodations used by Morocco Explored. They were lodgings of character and charm, clean, comfortable and centrally located.\u2022 The pre-arranged city guides: our guide in Fez was fantastic: extremely knowledgeable and a tireless advocate for his hometown. The Marrakech guide was good, but too much time was spent in workshops and stores where we had no interest in buying what was on offer (as we eventually explained to him). The palmery tour was a waste: our guide raced us through fields that were alternately dusty and muddy, then left us at the local rug cooperative (our second of three for the week) for a shopping opportunity.\u2022 The driver/guide: staffing is an area where Morocco Explored needs improvement. The quality of the driver/guide during an extended long tour (a week or more) has a direct impact on the quality of your visit. You spend long hours in the car with your driver/guide, who is your primary interface with the land you\u2019re travelling through and the person most available to interpret it for you. It\u2019s important that they have good language skills, are knowledgeable of the area they\u2019re travelling through, eager to share that knowledge with their passengers, know where to stop and what to point out. In my initial inquiries to Morocco Explored I asked whether we would have the same/driver guide throughout and was told that it was \u201clikely\u201d unless they were really busy. Fortunately our trip was scheduled for the low-volume, shoulder season, when demand for drivers was low. Even more fortunately, we immediately struck up a good relationship with our guide, who was more than competent in every respect: a safe and considerate driver, friendly, courteous, thoughtful, accommodating, knowledgeable and passionate about sharing that knowledge with us. Midway through our tour, we were informed that our driver was being replaced. When I called the office to protest, the manager gave several explanations of why this change was necessary. They all worked to the advantage of Morocco Explored\u2019s business interests but took no account of their pre-trip representations nor of their clients\u2019 satisfaction (which you\u2019d think would be an important business interest). As it turned out the replacement guide was clearly second string: on his car door was the emblem of a different tour operator; he spoke extremely limited English (communication between us was carried out in French, which I then had to translate for my traveling companion); he had either limited knowledge of the area or limited interest in sharing that knowledge with us. For example, he tried to rush us out of the World Heritage Site of Ait Ben Haddou without our even setting foot within its famous walls. Then, as we entered the celebrated valley of 1000 kasbahs, we waited expectantly for our driver to stop at one or to at least point out one or two and tell us something about them. Not a peep from him. When I finally asked where the kasbahs were, he replied that we had left them behind along ago. We wonder how much more we missed during the time we spent with him. In summary, we found that Morocco Explored had the knowledge and the resources to provide at the least a satisfactory tour experience. But in our case, the quality of their staffing was not consistent, nor did they provide the continuity of service we had been led to expect."

The sights along the ways were amazing and interesting. The best part of the tour was our driver Hicham. His English was wonderful and he was a saint for putting up with our curiosity and all of our questions. Hicham is a great driver and makes you feel totally safe all along the way. He truly loves the area and knows it well, as coming from a Berber village along the route. Everything from booking to the end of the tour was fast and easy and without a hitch. I'd certainly use Morroco Explored again when visiting Morocco."

We were very pleased with the response to all of our questions and requests and with the plans that were developed. Our riad in Marrakesh could not have been a better location \u2013 just minutes from the Jemaa El Fna. We had a four day excursion into the interior complete with tea with a nomad family, a camel ride at sunset to a camp in the dunes and a visit to a number of interesting sites including Ait Ben Haddou (UNESCO heritage site). Our guide and driver, Hicham was excellent. Because he grew up in the area we were travelling to he was a great source of information. We were well taken care of and always felt safe. We were happy to see that he would also be our driver to Essaouira. We would definitely recommend Morocco Explored."

The tour included 1 night in a desert camp. The sights along the way were amazing. The old fortresses, casbahs, and berber villages were very interesting, as was an off road journey. All the stays and meals were great [the best dish we had in Morocco was on the tour in Tinehir, a chicken and almond pastilla]. The desert trip on camels to the desert camp was the highlite of our trip [Thank you Said, our camel guide (you can use our scorpion joke if you want)]. The experience was something we will remember forever. But the best part of the tour was the staff. We had a driver and a guide. Mohammed and Khalid were both terrific. They were knowedgeable, professional and simultaneously friendly and cordial. We really enjoyed their company, and the pure driving part of the tour went by quickly. Last, but not least, we want to mention Robbin. Robbin coordinated the tour. She was responsive and helpful and we wished we would have gotten to meet her also. Shukran bzef, thank you very much Morocco Explored."

            "review": "Wonderful private overnight tour. After booking a 9-day trip to Morocco, my husband and I decided we'd like to venture a bit beyond Marrakech and Essaouira and after several emails back and forth, booked a private overnight trip to the Atlas Mountains, Ouarzazate, Ait Ben-Haddou, and Telouet with Morocco Explored. They were very helpful and responsive by email, and in retrospect, I should have taken their advice to book a 2-night tour so we could have seen and done more with them (but that's my fault -- not theirs!). As we were visiting a bit early in the season, we were provided with both a trainee driver, Abdul, and a guide, Khaled, who met us at our riad in Marrakech and led us to their comfortable Toyota SUV. Khaled was professional, friendly, and spoke very good English. Although his primary role is usually as a driver, he pointed out interesting sites along the way, answered our questions to the best of his knowledge, walked us through Ait Ben-Haddou, and offered to take photos for us. We stopped at several scenic overlooks in the mountains, and whenever the driver heard me turn my camera on, he would slow down or offer to stop so I could get a better photo. The restaurants where we stopped for lunch had decent food and were reasonably priced, and the rest stops were clean.The hotel they put us up in near Ait Ben-Haddou was a bit spartan, but certainly adequate for an overnight stay, and included dinner and breakfast. The second day of our trip was mostly spent in the car driving back towards Marrakech, where we switched drivers before continuing on to Essaouira. This caused a bit of a delay and we didn't have time to stop at an Argan oil cooperative on the way, but I suspect my husband was pleased about that. Essalah, who I had corresponded with by email to organize the trip, surprised us in Marrakech with a box of Moroccan pastries and some fruit for the journey.Both drivers were very good, and apart from one scary moment where a speeding minivan nearly ran us off the road coming around a curve, we felt very safe in the car, even on the narrow, winding roads in the mountains. If I ever have a chance to go back to Morocco, I would certainly book a longer trip with this company."

For the first day we were troubled by our missing luggage but Mr. Essalah was so generous to help us contact the airport and had his driver driving us around Marrakesh even though it was not on our tour itinerary. The next 4 days we headed to the desert (erg Chebbi), we stopped at many famous sites along the way, and We enjoyed every single bit of what Morocco Explored had planned for us!! SO MUCH to see and enjoy, we LOVEDDD it!!! Without doubt the whole trip was brought alive by our wonderful driver, Khalid. He was knowledgeable, friendly and funny! he kept me entertained and educated throughout the excursion. We would certainly give Khalid ten out of ten for his knowledge. We saw so many famous sites and Khalid surprised us all by showing us many different sides of Morocco as well as telling us stories about Berber. My friend requested if possible for her to visit one of the schools and he made it happened!! The entire staff was courteous and fabulous!!!! And remember to give Khalid your camera; He took a lot of fabulous photos for us!!! Khalid also a careful driver and we felt VERY SAE in his SUV.

So Khaled pulled over when he saw a nomadic family walking their herd and asked them if i could hold and pet them. Also, I am allergic to gluten. Khaled was on it! He made sure that I was not served gluten; he checked to make sure all soups, etc. had no flour. My husband is very interested in music. Khaled played CDs of traditional Berber music and even took my husband CD shopping! The experiences were surprising and amazing, so many things we did not even expect. Feeding wild monkeys on the side of the road, off-roading and having tea in a nomadic family's cave...to name a few. We learned a lot about Berber life and the culture in Morocco. WELL WORTH IT!

First of all let me say you have a beautiful country, unfortunately the tour we did with you for the New Year's celebration did not do it justice.It is sad as we based the choice of the tour based on the so well recomendation on TripAdvisor but for us was very unfortunate and we did not expirience any of the service level that we would expect.To start off, we were expecting a 4x4 vehicle with up to 4 people as described by you beforehand, but we end ed up in a van with a total of 6 people. We understand it is Holiday season and you may have more people booking and we were lucky with the people traveling with us so I guess we could get let that go. What we cannot get over though is the fact that our van was always following another van with around 10 other people, becoming apparent that we were following them and that both vans had to be at certain point at specific times. You would agree that means the purpose of having a driver for ourselves in order to enjoy the beautiful sightseeing is completely lost. We were always late and spent pretty much 2 days in the van rushing from a place to the other. Actually even some of the places we were meant to visit had to be postponed to the last day on the way back to Marrakech and we ended up not seeing them at all! The trip back to Marrakech was the most boring and tiring 550km of our lives. The tour itinerary provided claimed that we would be in Marrakech by 18h and we had booked the hotel accordingly.You had advised us about of \"morrocan time\", but over 4 hours delay is more than anyone should reasonably expect and to be quite honest was a result of lack of planning and organization. Even your driver said that it is impossible to return to Marrakech until 18h as it takes a 10h trip, which for us took almost 13 hours. Prior to the journey back we were told we had to change vans (to an older and less comfortable one) and drivers (to an older, slower and less competent one). We went exceedingly slowly all the way and stopped at driver chosen places for breaks and lunch that were very bad. It is unfortunate that for the price we paid to ensure a trip that sounded personalized, off the beaten path and adventurous, where we would have the time to enjoy the beauty of morocco, we ended up spending 4 days in a van with little to do, few stops to take photos because we were always being schedule, missed defined sites and bunched in a 17 person trip.We are very unhappy and won't recommend your services. I hope the above will help you to ensure you provide quality services to all clients. Sadly it will be too late for us, as we can't recover the hours lost, money spent and enjoyment missed."

Although it is a fixed route our driver Hicham stopped for us to take in the views and take photographs at every opportunity and to do so very often taking a short detour off road (including to a salt mine). And not forgetting the best bit, Ait Benhaddou, WOW !Just to conclude - A long but fantastic day, seeing some stunning scenery on a private and personal tour and on top of that great value for money.

The pre-trip communication was fast and professional, the itinerary was well spelled out and I also got a lot of travel tips in general. We had two drivers, Salah had to leave after the first day when Khalid took over. We were sad that Salah had to leave, but he passed on our travel preferences and our last minute customized plans seamlessly to Khalid, so we can continue enjoying our trip. Both drivers are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The best part about traveling with them is that they give you a lot of flexibility to explore and customize, just don't be afraid to ask: we have gone off-road, made frequent unplanned stops and tried various exciting and delicious local foods from local markets.The local guides and the riad they have arranged as part of the tours are all excellent, which really made our whole tour experience tremendous. Not to mention, after we were done with the desert tour and were dropped off in our riad in Fez, they still took an extra step and helped us arrange a guide in Fez. Overall, we felt well taken care of, to the point of being a little spoiled. With Morocco explored, the beautiful Morocco unveiled herself in front of our eyes like a magnificent painting. I would personally recommend the company to any of my friends and to any travelers out there who wants to explore Morocco right."

I can't say enough good things about him - he was a great driver, very knowledgeable about the history/culture/food of the region, had a great sense of humor and is probably the most patient person I've met in a very long time. He answered our many questions without complaint (even when a few complaints were probably deserved!). He was also very flexible with the itinerary. He accommodated our requests when we wanted to spend more or less time in an area. He also took us to \"extra\" sites when we expressed interest in something - sometimes, this meant we stopped 3 times in one day to look at goats and sheep on the side of a mountain. Other times, this meant taking us to multiple nomad caves to explore and better understand the Berber way of life. We were definitely never bored!The accommodations provided were all good quality with good service. We had free Wi-fi in all hotels, but in some places, it only worked in the lobby/restaurant/pool area and not in the rooms. I was particularly impressed with the quality of the camp in the Sahara. The tents were large and comfortable. The food provided was delicious and the entertainment was...well, entertaining. And sleeping under the stars was awe-inspiring.I highly recommend the 4 or 5 day tour.

We had a great driver, his english was excellent and a good depth of knowledge of the area and the local politics as well. Our first stop was Telouet and we had this place to ourselves. Then onto Ait, our driver organised a guide for us and he picked a well spoken young Berber, although it was about 40c we had a great time as the guide not only had a good depth of knowledge but a great sense of humour. It was a big day made very memorable. Our sincere thanks to Robbin for organizing it all.The only other thing I would like to mention is the cost. I found the price of the day tour to be fantastic value for money"

Salah, the site manager in Marrakesh, and Morocco Explored did an excellent job, putting together a travel itinerary that met our needs and assured us a good experience. It all went smoothly, and we felt in good hands, appreciating a new and different culture. The camel trek was, of course, amazing, and has been the highlight of our adventure. Our whole trip was enhanced by the positive experiences we had with our driver, Khalid. Morocco Explored is fortunate indeed to have him in its employ as he is an excellent driver, always competent and safe on the road and that includes our time \"off-road!\" Most of all, he is such a fine young man who patiently and kindly answered all my continuous questions. He and I had many an enlightening conversation about our different cultures and countries. He was not just our driver, but our key source of information to understand Morocco, everything from geography to botany and from history to philosophy. He is a terrific guy, and it added immeasurably to our experience to have gotten to know him. Thank you once again, Salah, for introducing us to your wonderful country, and thank you, Khalid, for making our experience so memorable. I recommend Morocco Explored wholeheartedly."

He was a safe driver who shared his culture with us throughout the wonderful trip. We added an additional day in the desert because we were having such a wonderful time, and he was happy to accommodate our change in plans. It was obvious that he loved his job and loved sharing various facts about Morocco. He answered our endless questions about Moroccan culture, religion, and everything in between. He had a great sense of humor which was an added bonus. Essalah, the owner, was also very easy to work with. He met me in my Riad lobby to start the trip and take me to the awaiting car. I would highly recommend Morocco Explored to anyone and will use them again. I am sure the driver could make or break the trio...so ask for Khalid...he definitely aimed to please--and he did!"

            "review": "Good trip, bad driver. We have just returned from 8 days in Morocco. I arranged all the hotels and airfare and Morocco Explored arranged the desert trip and provided a driver/guide. Robbin was helpful scoping out the trip. The problem was our driver, Ibrihim. On the plus side, Ibrihim was on time each day and knew the country well. He drove carefully, though usually 10 km less than the speed limit which added hours to long day trips. On the negative side, Ibrihim did not speak English well. This lead to much frustration, on his part and ours. He also seemed to have his own idea of what our trip should be like. On the first day in the High Atlas Mountains, Ibrihim kept wanting us to stop to take pictures. When we said we didn't need to, he seemed offended. At 10:30am he pulled over to a mountain restaurant and said we should take pictures. When we said again we didn't need to, he said, 'well I need to stop for breakfast'. As a guide, Ibrihim had no knowledge of the history of Morocco. He didn't know that November 16th was Moroccan independence day. Imagine someone in the US not knowing what July 4th was. His tour guiding comments consisted of such things as 'king has palace here' in Erfoud (he said this twice, once the first time we went through Erfoud and once the second time) and 'bus station' when we passed a bus station. In the end, he pretty much stopped talking to us. When, on the last day, I said we wanted to go to Casablanca (a stop that was on our itinerary) to see the mosque, he became upset. Either he had not been informed about the stop or he just didn't want to drive into the city (traffic is horrible). I think the biggest incident in the trip was when we stopped in a small village so my daughter and I could get some bananas and apples to eat in the car. Nearly everyone in Morocco wants to take advantage of foreigners. When I asked Ibrihim to help me deal with the fruit vendor so I wasn't overcharged (I had no change), he just walked away and laughed in my face, saying, 'everyone charged the same price'. Which of course is a lie."

Essallah is now a good friend and recently gave me some very valuable advice and assistance on my latest trip cycling around Morocco. They are not only a company but generous and genuine people who really want to help people, promote their beautiful country and make sure your experience there is the best it can be.The first time I went I didn't go with the intention of taking a tour, and organised it last minute when I arrived and heard about Morocco Explored. It was one of the best tours I've ever been on. I went as a single woman alone, and actually was on the tour alone, and felt very safe and looked after the entire time. I've travelled the world a lot and for me, the scenery in Morocco, particular the areas south east of Marrakech, are absolutely spectacular. The landscape changes very frequently and the colours and natural beauty, along with the local development that blends perfectly with nature, are truly stunning. Sometimes I could not believe my eyes as to what I was seeing. And, being solo on the tour allowed me to change to some extent the journey along the way and take up different recommendations as we went, and I ended up actually extending my trip by a couple of days because it was so fabulous. Having a driver to explain the culture, the history, the food etc was very valuable and they were all very knowledgeable, and made it all very humane and real. The accommodation was always of good quality and the place I stayed in the Sahara Dessert was beautiful, and the breakfast amazing. Sleeping in the dunes in the Sahara Desert is wonderful. These tours are extremely good value - and this is coming from someone who usually sleeps in $5 dorms - and truly I'm not sure you can actually put a value on the experience because it's priceless. One thing I greatly appreciated is that Essallah and his team are very open to feedback along the way and ready to modify things as much as possible as needed, as they recognise that everyone's needs and expectations are different, and want all the people that travel with them to walk away with the best experience possible of their country, and their company.I highly recommend this company to anyone thinking about going to Morrocco, and I thank Essallah and his team not only for the trip they took me on, but their assistance with my recent cycling trip and the valuable advice given. Thank you."

From the start Robbin, the owner, was very helpful in ensuring that the trip suited our purposes. We were staying an extra three days in the country and thought that we would like to make the most of our time there by seeing as much as we could. This was no problem as Robbin added Chefchaouen to the last few days of our trip. We were really pleased that we finished the tour in this beautiful little town.We were travelling with our 20 year old son and we didn't really wish to pay for an extra room for him. This also proved to be of no trouble to Robbin, or all of the Riads/ Kasbahs where we stayed, as he either had his own bed, or a trundle bed provided.When we met the representative Salah on our first day, he tweaked the journey even more to ensure that we saw as much as possible. Hammoud our driver/guide in the car, was informative and knowledgable on all aspects of Morocco. Our guides around Marrakech, Fez and Tenerhir were courteous and knew their subjects too. Maybe, the only thing I could recommend to Morocco Explored was to have these guides ask whether the clients would like to buy carpets, pottery et cetera before being taken into the mandatory shops, because once you are in there, it is very hard not to buy something. To have a car meant that we were able to be taken off the main tourist routes and we got to see some absolutely beautiful scenery and get to try a few things that I would expect the average tourist taking a large bus trip, would not otherwise get to see, or do. I think the favourite thing that our family enjoyed (apart from the whole journey) was having a bbq on top of the Atlas Mountains with the mountains spread before us and the beautiful clean air surrounding us.The only down side of the trip was that our initial driver was sick. On our first day we were taken to Essaouira by Salah and had a great day. When we were then picked up by the next driver, who had very little English as did the next driver. Luckily my school girl French and our son's Spanish got us by for those days, but it didn't help that they couldn't communicate when and where we were to be picked up by the next driver and at what time. This led to some confusion for all involved. This was only a minor thing and really didn't detract from the overall experience. It made for a great tale back home and really made my French improve!Overall, our experience was a fantastic one and we were so glad to put our trust in to Robbin's and Hammoud's very capable hands. It is always a worry when dealing with unfamiliar companies, but we can thoroughly recommend the integrity and help that Morocco Explored gave."

Robin was very informative and helpful in preparing our trip. We had nights in Meknes, Fes (2) Tinehir, Hotel Jasmina in the desert and a night in the desert camp which was the true highlight at the foot of the huge sandhills in nomad tents and we ate the best targine we have had there and were entertained by our Berber friends and slept under the brightest stars. The camel ride to get to the camp was an adventure in itself! Hammou our driver was fantastic and took us looking for nomads during the day and we were lucky to be invited into their tents for mint tea. Back on the road to Marrakech, we visited the Todra Gorge, Dades And Rose Valleys and did some amazing off road driving, we stayed at Ait Ben Hadou and explored the great Kasbah then onto the exciting and chaotic Marrakech for 3 nights. We thentravelled to Essourira on the coast for 2 nights. The old town is charming and a lot less chaotic than Marrakech and also for purchases a lot less expensive, so save your shopping for here! Our last day and night we where back in Marrakech a place which you could never forget. All of or 4 nights here we ate with the locals in the Jemaa el Fna and the food delicious. You can also buy large vlasses of freshly squeezed orange juice here for about 4 dirhams. Hammou was with us all the way from Fes and was a great driver and wonderful guide giving us so much information about the country and its . Also every riad/hotel was unique in its own way and most the locations were right in the centre of the old towns. We were very well looked after and would highly recommend Morocco Explored to anyone wishing a true adventure in Morocco. Thank you again Robbin, Hammou and Essalah in Marakech."

It was wonderful to be guided by Hammou, a very knowledgable person on every aspect of Moroccan and Berber culture. Two highlights of our 4 day 3 night trek were having tea in a nomad Berber family's cave home and our camel ride through the desert. The best part of the desert trek was sleeping under the stars in the sand dunes if the Moroccan desert. Our guide for this part of the trip was Sayeed, a very jovial person who made us laugh a lot. Morocco Explored is the way to go if you are interested in an authentic Morocco. Our driver, Hammou, is a very easy-going person who is willing to accommodate any request. We were sad to leave him! When Hammou heard that we were interested in fossils, he took us to a museum and shop where they display amazing giant fossils from every period. Then he took us to a spot in the black desert where we could search among the rocks for our own fossils - and we found a bunch! We started our trip to Morocco with this tour and then finished with 3 relaxing days in Marrakech. So glad we planned it this way. **One caveat - if you upgrade to the 4 star riad for one of your nights, dinner is no longer included for that night. This was not clear to us from our email correspondence."

A nice open-minded person, very friendly, more than great with the kids: highly recommended! Salah proposed also nice places for eating and having coffee, without imposing his proposals, being at the same time discreet and kind.

Hammou, who we were with for three days, was especially helpful and gave us great information along the way about Morocco history and culture. There was not a question he didnt have an answer for! He even showed up one day with a fishing poll because my boyfriend is an avid fisherman. While we never really found a good place to fish, we really appreciated his effort. The places we stayed were decent and what we expected. We really loved the desert camel trek on New Year's Eve. The trip is also flexible and they accommodated our every request, even changing our accommodations one night at the last minute to make our new schedule work. Our group did not like the touristy spots, so Hammou took us to many local villages, a nomad family and local food places. We were paired with another couple from Canada who had similar interests which really added to the fun. I appreciate all of Robbin's help in making a memorable time for us in Morocco."

He was so knowledgeable about the flora and fauna, about the history and knew really interesting small wonderful places to take us with people he knew such as a private show at a music school or drinking camel milk in a large stable or having a private tour of a stonemason yard which was actually closed for day. Going with him to tour a market in a small town was amazing as there were no other tourists there. It would not have been the same without him and he had the patience of a saint to answer all questions we had about the culture, religion and politics of Morocco.

My sister and I opted for this tour as a middle ground between the security and hassle-free experience of a package tour, and an immersion, hands on experience; this mostly because we were travelling as two young women and were uncertain of the reception, but we also wanted to feel as though we were doing our own thing. The result was perfect! We chose Morocco Explored because of their wealth of information on the site, their quick and informative communication and their flexibility in tours. Our driver (Hammou) was great, speaking good English, great source of information and being very flexible and suggesting amendments to our tour itinerary as he got to know us better. Great value for money, and great way to see Morocco - an amazing country. Would recommend this company and experience 100% and without a hesitation!"

He drove a 4x4 Land Cruiser with air conditioning which was quite comfortable for the two of us.High Atlas Mountains were gorgeous, as was most of the landscape along the journey. Stopping off at Ait Binhaddu where many films and TV (including Game of Thrones) were filmed was very cool. Nothing was as cool as the actual camel trek across the dunes and sleeping outside under the stars in the camp.Wonderful trip, would recommend to anybody. Hassan picked us up and dropped us off at La Mamounia in Marrakesh where we were staying before and after the trek."

From the start he catered to whatever type of road trip we wanted, acknowledging that different clients had different preferences. My brother and I didn't want a very touristy trip. We wanted to see what the locals enjoyed, yet still hit the big sites. He was definitely able to give us that experience. I think the two major surprises for me were the yummy foods we got to try (we would have never known about some dishes if it wasn't for our guide), and secondly, the most amazing scenery we got to experience! I generally do not enjoy road trips, and these 4 days went by so fast. Each day, got better than the prior in regards to what we saw. Just when I thought I saw something so beautiful, the next day would beat it out in some shape or form! Thank you Salah and thank you Morocco Explored for creating such great memories for my brother and I!"

After researching multiple companies we decided to book our tour with this company. We booked a private tour with them and it was the best decision we ever made!!! We had the trip of a lifetime and it was a great journey. Extremely good price for what you are getting.Robin was our contact person before the trip and she was very helpful and planned the perfect itinerary according to the number of days we travelled and according to our budget. Every single detail was taken care of but we had the liberty to choose what we were interested in and what we wanted to spend our time in while making the most of our time.Our diver, Hammou, was absolutely amazing and a very special human being. Our trip would not have been the same with out him. He took us to really unique places and we felt we were able to see parts of the country and understand the culture in a very special way because of him. I very rarely write reviews after my trips but this company deserves every recommendation. You will not regret booking with them, they are truly excellent. Thank you so much for making our trip so special and unforgettable!"

We eventually chose Cascades Ouzoud with Morocco Explored and had a really great day. Whilst it was a long drive to the Falls, they were absolutely worth it and more spectacular than we had imagined. We hired a local guide once we got there (not included in the price) and he was excellent and allowed us to make the most of the trip, we would definitely recommend getting a guide to take you round. It is also possible to take a short boat trip right up to the bottom of the Cascades and we really enjoyed this but again costs extra, although only a few pounds. We would definitely recommend this trip, it was lovely to enjoy the landscape of Morocco outside the bustle of Marrakech!"

            "review": "three legs of a wonderful trip. My husband, our two adult daughters and I spent three weeks in Morocco in April. Some of that time was independent travel, but because one of our daughters could only spend 10 days with us, I decided to hire a car and driver for a five-day portion, from Fes to Marrakech. Being four also made the cost per person very reasonable. I chose Morocco Explored in part because, like me, the co-owner Robbin lives in Canada, so I could easily talk to her by phone; moreover, paying by interbank transfer was very easy and secure. Morocco Explored also offered an itinerary which included a night in the desert and a second night in a hotel beside the dunes. We didn't want to feel rushed on our first trip to a desert so this itinerary suited us. Our driver, Hammou, was excellent and very willing to explain the things we were seeing on the way. He obviously had done this trip many times before and knew the places to stop to take good pictures, to eat local food safely, to taste camel's milk and, importantly, to find clean washrooms. He was very attentive and always seemed to reappear just when we were ready to leave a spot. We never felt rushed and we never stopped at anything that felt like a tourist trap. Our camel ride into the desert with Ali was wonderful. We were the only four at the camp that night and it was magical. The riads and hotels we stayed at were all very comfortable and had great atmosphere. We always felt we were in Morocco, not the Holiday Inn. Breakfasts and suppers were included and we rated them good to excellent. After the one daughter had returned to Canada, the other three of us spent a few days in Marrakech on our own before leaving for another four-day tour with Morocco Explored. We went from Marrakech back south over the High Atlas to Taroudant, Tafraoute and finally Essaouira for a few days on the coast. Some people had told us that car rental was an option for this part of the trip, but none of us was willing to miss the scenery going over the mountain passes. This road requires constant vigilance and a driver experienced in the Moroccan driving customs. Rachid was our driver for these four days during which we discovered a much less visited part of the country. We stopped at places we certainly would have missed on our own. A highlight was a visit to a collective granary/fort at Imchguiguilne that dates from the 13th century. A truly spectacular site that we never could have seen if we had been on public transport. Morocco Explored booked the hotels (including a former pasha's rural auberge among citrus orchards) and suggested possible activities, but we could set the pace as we chose and it was relaxed. It included a bicycle ride through the countryside around Tafraoute. (I think this may not have been so pleasant in the summer months, but April was perfect.) All the cars we travelled in were comfortable and well maintained. We were so happy with Morocco Explored's services that we booked a transfer by car from Marrakech to the Casablanca airport on the morning of our departure from Morocco. Usually I'm nervous about being far from the airport on departure day, but we had confidence that our driver, Essalah, would get us there on time. This is a 2 1/2 hour drive on very good roads, much preferable to transferring our luggage from taxi to train to Casablanca to another train to the airport, hoping all the time that train service would not be interrupted or delayed. Thank you to everyone at Morocco Explored for making this trip go so smoothly. We could just sit back, relax and know that we were in excellent hands."

We were extremely fortunate in booking our trips throughout Morocco with the exceptional \"Morocco Explored\" who provided great service and value for money. This tour organisation excels at a personal and detailed approach to ensuring that your travel experiences proceed flawlessly and that your tailor made tours are the best Morocco has to offer. We had excellent attention from our highly knowledgeable, friendly and very caring drivers who ensured we saw magnificent scenery, enjoyed remarkable experiences and ate delicious food. The tours and excursions with our professional guides of an essential and captivating Morocco, such as Ait Benhaddou the labyrinthian souk in Fes and the exotic kasbah in Telouet were amazing experiences in themselves. However, I think that coming across places such as the roadside market en route to Quarzazate, the donkey market near Rissani, our time spent in the desert with our amiable camel driver and eating at the roadside stalls were pure magic. We were not always just funnelled into \"tourist ready\" eateries but on some occasions ate at roadside cafes from a simple stall serving tangine or a bbq. Many thanks are due to the wonderful staff including Salah, Hussein and Hammou (and others!) who, with their local knowledge, made the very best of our travel experiences in this alluring country, amongst some of the warmest and interesting people I've ever met."

It was a recommendation we were glad we took.From the start, the pre-trip communication was prompt and thorough. We even received a detailed information pack not only about our tour but tips about traveling in Morocco that we referred to often and found very helpful. Our driver, Salah was perfect! We couldn't have asked for a better person to help us discover this beautiful country. He was friendly, professional and had an excellent command of English. Salah made sure our journey was enjoyable and seamless and while we had an itinerary, he adapted for our pace and interests. Having a local person to accompany us through our adventure and give local insight was such an enriching experience. It really helped us to see a Morocco we might not have experienced on our own, and it was magical. From nights under the stars in the Sahara, to delicious meals off the beaten path, beautiful mountain landscapes, enchanting kasbahs and viewpoints, we were in awe at how diverse the country was and how Morocco Explored put together and itinerary that had us experience all the essential things and more.Overall, we felt the trip was an excellent value for all that we got to see and experience, the standard of transportation and for any details (guides, hotels, meals) that were arranged for us in the itinerary. I'm looking forward to my next trip to Morocco and with Morocco Explored."

From booking with robbin , Hammou arriving at our Riad in Fes, to an arranged guided tour of the beautiful palmeries in Tinehrir, there's been so much to see and do but the guides and itineraries change according to your interests and what you feel like doing. Hammou has helped me defeat my fear of heghts with humour and total confidence in what he's doing. Guides are extremely knowledgeable and are from the areas that youre visiting. Some of the places along the way are less interesting than others (fossil shop, movie museum) as the real highlights are the moroccan countryside and people you encounter along the way.

The trip going and coming back was long and we experienced all kinds of weather: heavy rain, wind, sand storm, hail, sun...but our driver was very professional and skilled. When you drive on those roads, in those conditions, the language that your driver speaks does not matter at all! The excursion to Ouarzazate was super. We took a glimpse of the desert and the locations where many movies were shot. We got what was promised at a very reasonable price, our time was used wisely and we did not stop at any pre-arranged souvenir shop.

The transport was clean and comfortable (a difficult call for some of those mountain passes!). Hamou, our driver and guide, was fantastic. He was interesting, interested and was happy to answer any (and there were many) questions about Morocco, Berber culture and history.

Robbin provides all the information you need in a relaxed but very efficient way. There are so many tour options in Morocco that it is hard to distinguish. From our first contact we had confidence we had made the right choice in a price range we could afford.The tour was a great experience. Our driver was friendly, funny, generous, considerate and in short made the tour a success and fun. The LandCruiser was comfortable as we settled in for the first day of our five day trip from Fes to Marrakech. The first hotel had the dunes of the desert at its feet and the swimming pool was a welcome way to unwind. The camel trek was a wonderful experience. The guide was friendly and helpful and the camel ride to the Berber desert camp great fun. Looking up from the simple tagine dinner our guides prepared, I was reminder just how many stars are in the heavens. The rest of the tour was also very enjoyable. The hotels had character and although they were not luxury, they were comfortable and met expectations for the price range of the tour. The desert scenery, kasbahs, green palm filled valleys and natural beauty was there to be seen. We also shared a home cooked meal with a Berber family and picked up some tips on preparing cous cous. We have travelled a lot in wealthy Europe, but are inexperienced newbies when it comes to traveling in countries were to own a donkey is to be well off. It was a an eye opener for us. Traveling through Morocco with Morocco Explored allowed us to get out of the pampered environment of the Riads of Fes and Marrakech to see some of the country and to met and talk to Morrocans. We highly recommend Morocco Explored."

Robin was quickly responsive to all my questions and concerns.We had Hammoud as our driver and guide. He was excellent, friendly and very informative. He was great with our 9 year old daughter and had a great sense of humor. He was also very responsive to our requests. A very pleasant person to spend time with. We visited Berber semi-nomadic family, Ait Benhaddou, took a great camel ride out into the desert and more. If I changed one thing it would be to have explored the food a bit more. This isn't our driver's fault or ME's fault per se, but we are adventurous eaters and love to explore the culture through food. We always ate at establishments that catered to tourists. I know this is partly because of the concern of 'bugs', but we found the food to be too catered to tourists and if we did this again (might just!) we'd insist on eating more 'local'.One recommendation: realize that in some places (Ait Benhaddou, Tinehir), there are separate guides that you will have to tip or pay for. For some reason I didn't realize this (assumed our driver/guide would do all of it), but our ME guide told us we could go without or with a guide so it was up to us. . The guide at Ait Benhaddou was useless (not Hammoud's fault) and I wish we hadn't taken him. The guide to the palmerie and old mosque in Tinehir was excellent and a delight. The tip to both averaged about 100 dirham (12US dollars).One side note about the trip. We are a same-sex couple with transracially adopted daughters. We were uniformly treated with respect and friendliness by ME, Hammoud and the Moroccan people. Of course, more often than not the Moroccans couldn't figure out our family structure, but when they learned it or figured it out, they were friendly and respectful. ME was excellent in that regard of course.Visited November 2011"

Indeed he was a great tour companion. -The car that we were provided was very well kept and quite new. We were really happy with the quality. Seeing that the kids enjoyed the vehicle, he even took the troubles to give us a short offroading experience, through the river and the rocky desert! - I had opted for the day trip.

Definitely great service! - I was offered cheaper alternatives when I got to Marrakech and at our hotel. Many were in the range of 800 - 1200 dhs. But, to be honest I am not sure if I would have received the same level of quality I received from you guys. So, maybe I might have paid more than the normal price, but I am extremely happy with the service. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is looking to experience Marrakech in quality!"

Our driver and guide, Hamal was absolutely fantastic, he was friendly, informative and very personable. He made the ten hour trip very, very enjoyable.I will just add that I am disabled with very limited mobility so have to rely on a wheelchair for walking anymore than a few feet and Marrakech and the trip to Ait Benhadou is not really setup for peoples with such disabilities, so don't expect dropped curbs, nice flat smooth surfaces etc. That being said, Hamal made sure he pushed me in my wheelchair so my family could go off and view things and if you can immerse yourself in the culture and scenery you will still have a very enjyable trip.Note: I also went down to the Souks in my wheelchair one night with the family which was a very interesting experience. While pedestrians see it as taking your life in your hands crossing streets and going down through the marketplace into the Souks I personally found that everyone stopped for me in my wheelchair, even the maddest of motorcyclists hahaha!It was a fantastic experience and I would not hesitate going back to Marrakech (only not during Ramadan) and would definitely book with Morocco Explored again."

When then decended towards Ouarzazate to the magnificent Ait-Benhaddou Kasbah. The scenarios and landscapes are unforgettable, but I would also strongly reccommend the choice of a good driver and knowledeable guide. We had both in the person of Hamou, who made our day comfortable and most interesting. We also visited the Telouet Kasbah, equally fascinating and hiding an amazing couple of rooms. There are many similar excursions on offer in Marrakech, Morocco Explored gave us punctuality, good service, excellent veichle and a great guide. Thank you! We'll definitely come back for more!E.C.

            "review": "Best guide in Morocco. My husband and I recently undertook a 5 day trip from Morocco Explored (Fes - Sahara Erg Chebbi dunes - Dades Gorge - Todra Gorge - Fes) and we would recommend Morocco Explored as a solidly reliable and good value tour company with excellent customer service. They have an office in Marrakesh and one in Canada, so there is someone on the ground in Morocco as well as abroad, and you receive very good Canadian customer service and it was no trouble for us to book from England. We had a scrap with Paypal and Robbin and Salah (?) were helpful in sorting it out, though it is unfortunate that they don't take credit cards because PayPayl were appalling.However, it was abundantly clear to us that the primary reason we had such a good trip was because our guide Hamou stood apart as an excellent guide and driver. Hamou is superior to other official guides, many of whom - with the best of intentions - repeat an identical script about Morocco (presumably learned through the official tour guide qualifications process) and who inevitably take you to their mate's carpet shop, etc. and tell silly lies about the fact that mint leaves produce natural bright green dye and that the 8 bales of hay a 70 year-old woman has to carry on her back in a giant harness aren't actually heavy (even when you don't ask about it) - and don't get me started on the unsolicited comments about the hygenic value of circumcision. And here I except our hiking guide in the Dades Gorge, Mohammad, who was brilliant and who even had a friendly dog (Milou) who was trained to watch out for scorpions and snakes.Hamou won't waste your time or your money, he is intuitively sensitive to the needs and preferences of his guests and he is always on time and in good spirit. He is also, and take note if you are going outside of the cities, an extremely accomplished and safe driver and believe me, you will need one because the roads/other drivers can be perilous and he's brilliant at off-roading (Morocco Explored have a Toyota Land Cruiser and it is good condition with A/C). Hamou even cooked for us and he can play the drums and cut up a melon into perfect 1-inch squares and he speaks several languages, practically self-taught.I tell you all this because I do not think our journey would have been as informative, as relaxed or as sophisticated if we hadn't specifically had Hamou - so do try to request him. The quality of your whole journey is ALL about your guide. The hotels in which we stayed through Morocco Explored were honest and good value; the food was very good and the rooms had A/C if we wanted it. The one bad experience we had was when our Fes guide took us to the Najjare Restaurant in Fes (next to the area where carpenters make the marriage chariots). Thanks to Hamou, we had been able to avoid places like this the whole week but we didn't really know how to extract ourselves from it once we were inside because our guide disappeared and we thought we might be able to order one course (no). There wasn't a menu (and hence no prices) and we were presented with several courses of mediocre food that we didn't want for the equivalent of \u00a350 (which, and let me look it up, yes, that is more than the cost of lunch at the Ivy or La Caprice in London). You may very well be up for that sort of lunch but if you are not, stand firm before your even step in the door of any restaurant. Having said that, it's a good idea to have a guide if you want to explore Fes in a day (otherwise, you may not be able to find what you wnat to see) and our guide showed us things we wouldn't have experienced otherwise.We travelled in mid-June and, possibly because it's quite hot in June and possibly because of turmoil across the Middle East and North Africa, there weren't many tourists and this very much enhanced the experience. We had no hassle outside of Fes and not nearly as much as we had expected within it."

There are open-air restaurants at the top, midway and at the bottom, along with plenty of stalls selling typical Morrocan products. Of course you can make your way alone, but if you prefer to pay a guide less than 10euros, he can accompany you along the route, pointing out details and assisting you across the rocks at the bottom (unless you'd like to hop on one of the very colorful boats). Don't pass the fresh orange juice stand without sampling a refreshing glass for about 40 cents."

Slightly limited payment methods - cash or paypal only, would have been easier to pay by credit card directly. Other than this we had a great 4 day trip from Marrakesh to the Sahara. Lots of driving but made manageable by the stops along the way. Our guide, Hamu, was fantastic, taking us to various individual stops. He seemed to tune into what we mentioned in conversation - fossils or films and found places along the way that focused on these. We were two adults and two 10 year old children and the driving could have been difficult. But the conversations, quiet jokes and insights into the culture meant the time in the car felt part of the experience. Although we had expected the camel trek to be the highlight actually the journey there and back, the amazing scenery, the stops, the extra small things - helping the kids find fossils in the desert - was actually even better. The camel trek and night in the desert was also really good but had a slight sense of unreality - it\u2019s clear the dunes are an island in the rocky, scrubby desert around, that they are studded by camps and lines of camels all snaking through them and if the whole 4 days had been about getting to them I would have been disappointed. As it was the trip felt fascinating and amazing. Hamu made it frankly. if you read this Hamu, thankyou and the children have told all your jokes in school."

A friend and I did the four-day (3-night) desert trek, from Marrakech-Marrakech, with Morocco Explored last month, and we had the most fantastic time. I would recommend it wholeheartedly and I really hope yesterday's terrible incident in Marrakech does NOT put people off travelling to Morocco. Our experience of Morocco was of a beautiful country with wonderful people.We were drawn to book with Morocco Explored not only because the itinerary sounded great, but because it gave us the flexibility to say what date we wanted to start the trip. Robbin in Canada was very helpful with any email enquiries we had before we booked. Once there, our driver, Hamou, was brilliant - very funny, very thoughtful and informative, and he did everything he could to make sure we had the best possible experience on the trip. We had asked Robbin to open up the trip to other travellers who wanted to join us, to try to fill some of the spaces in the car. One other person signed up to join us, and this worked out fine. The car we travelled in was very comfy, and the accommodation was varied but fine (a different place each night); the first place we stayed in had run out of hot water in the morning when we had our showers, but we realise on this sort of trip that you just get on with it. It's all part of the adventure :)It was my friend's birthday while we were there, and Hamou helped me by organising the most amazing memorable birthday surprise for her. I won't say what the birthday surprise was, in case he arranges the same thing for anyone else in the future - I don't want to ruin the surprise! - but Hamou went above and beyond the call of duty in organising it. This is just one example of the lengths he went to, to make sure we had a great experience.We saw many amazing sights on the trip, and Hamou would stop frequently for us to take photos. We weren't 'herded around' on the trip at all, and could let Hamou know if we wanted to do something else nearby, or stop to see something we had spotted. He also advised us on food (my friend and I are both strict vegetarian) and we ate very well on the trip. We went fossil-hunting, had tea with a nomad and his goats, had a snowball fight in our flipflops (the air was warm!) and of course saw the kasbahs, beautiful desert scenery, did some off-roading, which Hamou (and the rest of us) clearly loved, and had many good conversations. And of course the night in the desert! I had been a bit apprehensive about riding a camel until I tried it, but I absolutely loved it, and I would do it again in a flash if I could. It was the most relaxing and lovely way to see the desert. and instead of sleeping in the tent that night, we moved our matresses out to sleep under the stars, as it was a very bright moon and the sky was too amazing to miss. This was definitely a trip we will remember fondly forever. If you are the type of person who loves to really see a place, and not just be a typical 'tourist', you should definitely check out Morocco Explored as we had a wonderful time. And ask for Hamou!"

On our way to the desert, Erg Chebbi, we passed several Berber villages and kasbahs and breathtakingly beautiful landscapes as we went over the High Atlas Mountains. We stopped at Ait Benhaddou, a UNESCO World Heritage Site which serves as a backdrop in many films. We stayed the night in Dades valley in a so-so hotel overlooking the gorge.In the morning, we continued on to the Todra Gorge, which is beautiful, and got a tour of a Berber farming area and village by a local. We were shown how Berber carpets are handmade by local women, but we weren't pressured to buy. We continued on to the highlight of the trip, the sand dunes of Erg Chebbi and the camel trek and overnight stay in the desert. The Berber host was very nice and accommodating. After an hour or so camel trek to the sleeping area, they set up camp and cooked tagine while we climbed the dunes. We slept outside under the stars with our group. Overall, it was a very pleasant and memorable experience.On the third day, we took an 8 hour drive through the Middle Atlas Mountains on our way to Fez. We passed through Ifrane, a wealthy town which is a great contrast to the rest of the places we visited in Morocco, as well as the woods near it where monkeys roam. How did I like Morocco Explored? Overall, it was good. The driver and tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, but he may have stakes in the company, so I am not sure if all tour guides are professional and Westernized in a way like him. It was a great tour to take if you are under a strict time limit, as I'm sure a lot of travelers are, and have the budget for such a trip. Morocco Explored is not by any means a bargain, and is not aimed at backpackers or those seeking really authentic experiences. You will feel like a tourist, as you drive around in a luxury SUV. You will probably see a lot more on this tour than you would have by yourself (unless you have tons of time and are willing to take the regional buses), but what you lose is authenticity in your experience. Also, please note that besides the up-front cost, you are paying for a lot of food along the way, as well as tipping the guides and other random expenses. So remember to add some budget on top of what you already allocated towards this tour. Also, we were warned by the owner of Morocco Explored that the 3 day tour from Marrakesh to Fez was very fast and we may be compromising seeing and experiencing some sites along the way. She was right, so I would recommend doing this tour in longer than just 3 days. Either than that, I have no complaints with the tour and would recommend it to others."

From the moment we decided to take our tour with Morocco Explored the communication for payment, itinerary and information was clear, straightforward and easy. Most importantly though, from the moment Essalah (our tour guide) greeted us at our hotel we found our tour incredibly enjoyable. We feel very lucky that two key aspects worked out perfectly. Firstly, the other couple who joined us were friendly and energetic, and secondly, that Essalah brought so much energy, knowledge, openness and humour to the group. His expert driving was appreciated through the winding roads of the Atlas and his willingness to give us a window into Moroccan culture was especially appreciated. He knew some great places to stop for photos, try almonds straight from the tree or sample some real local food away from the tourist trail. We all felt really relaxed and comfortable during our wide-eyed journey through some of beautiful Morocco. The accommodation was perfect, the food was delicious, and the activities and sights were perfectly designed. We always felt able to ask if we wanted to stop quickly for a photo or have input about when and where we stopped for lunch. We cannot overstate the important role which Essalah played during the tour. It is quite remarkable that he made such an impression in such a short amount of time. We felt comfortable and confident in all our interactions with locals, and were able to get help with everything from protocol to pronunciation advice. His laughter, jokes and warmth will always be an integral part of our memories of Morocco. This tour was, in every aspect, simply outstanding. Rest assured we have been, and will continue, recommending Morocco Explored to all our friends and family.

We did the 4 day Marrakech to Marrakech tour.Negatives- We were under the impression that the tour price covered entry fees to monuments, museums, etc. so a bit disappointing when we were asked to pay for these, or provide 100 or 150 dirhams to local guides. Although they were never expensive, they do add up, just would have been good to know about this in advance.- Restaurants we were taken to for lunch were expensive (at least compared to other places we had been to in Marrakech) and all set menus. The set menus were an issue. We'd prefer to be able to choose a small meal for lunch, especially when you are getting back into a 4x4 and going off road or on windy roads, our stomachs were definitely put to the test. By far the best lunch we had was a simple bbq at a rest stop with our driver!- Local guides were not all high quality, although this may not be entirely under the control of Morocco Explored, but perhaps something they should look into. We were not fussed about guides that ended their tours in their shops as we have experienced his before and used the opportunity to learn about their trade, asking lots of questions and learning more about rugs and berber tradition that we otherwise would have.Positives:- We only had a week in Morocco but because of the Morocco Explored tour we saw and experienced so much, a lot that we never would have had the time or resources to organise ourselves. Although there is a lot of time in the car, there are plenty of stops and always astounding views to take in. There are just the right amount of sights to see spread out over the 4 days.- Our driver Hammou was fantastic! Aggressive enough on the roads to get us along in good time, but never took unnecessary risks. He was welcoming and always checking how we were doing and if we needed anything. As we got to know him, we also appreciated his sense of humour, and willingness to talk to us about any aspect of Moroccan culture we asked about.- The camel trek and camping in the Sahara desert was an experience we will never forget. In particular the opportunity to sit down and converse with desert nomads over a meal was a major highlight of our 4-week overseas trip. There were several other unique experiences along the way which made the whole 4 day tour a complete package and we have many stories to tell our friends and family since returning home!- The vehicles were excellent. Although Hammou's car had some trouble with a battery, which we were very glad did not occur while we were in the middle of the desert.- Accommodation was very good. Clean, good food, hot water in all."

            "review": "You can't miss the Moroccan Sahara!\". I am an American living in Morocco and Morocco Explored was recommended to me by Peace Corps and Fulbright people living here who book with them when friends and family visit. After participating in the 4-day Marrakech to Marrakech tour with two female friends, I am definitely thankful for the recommendation and want to pass it on. I whole-heartedly agree with the other reviews here about the kindness of the guides and drivers and the professionalism of the company and the owners (I met them both first hand and can attest that their commitment to eco- and social-consciousness is sincere). A few other thoughts about desert treks in general and Morocco Explored in particular: My visiting friends were skeptical about traveling so far from Marrakech, but I was adamant that they had to see the Moroccan Sahara. Yes, we had to spend a lot of time driving, but the beautiful scenery and desert experience is so worth it. The moment you find yourself sitting on top of huge sand dune looking up at a gazillion stars with nothing but complete silence around you, you will agree. A few months before I had been on group tour to the same desert area with a different (cheaper) company and it was an awful time due to the harassment we experienced from their desert guides. It was shocking how different the Morocco Explored experience was: the desert guide we had was mature, serious, and professional. He was also a great cook and an excellent musician! I\u2019ve stayed in a number of desert/mountain auberges throughout my time in Morocco and they\u2019ve all been basically the same. They are functional places for sleeping and eating while on the trek. Personally, I find them rustically charming but if you are looking for fluffy towels and pillows and ultra-attentive service, I recommend that you bookend your desert trip with a stay at a riad in Fez or Marrakech. Lack of consistent hot water can be an issue anywhere in Morocco, especially in winter. We had sporadic hot water at the auberges we stayed at with Morocco Explored, but we also had the same problem at the upscale riad I booked on my own in Marrakech. The mountains and desert get cold at night, and in the winter it can get very cold. Central heat is virtually non-existent in Morocco. Make sure you pack clothes that you can layer on and off. For the desert trip, it would be smart to bring your own sleeping bag or a sleeping sheet.Finally, the Atlas Mountains have very windy, steep roads. If you are prone to motion sickness, I definitely recommend bringing along some meds, etc."

As a loather, in principle, of tour groups, I was skeptical when my friend suggested we take the Morocco Explored 4 day Marrakesh to Marrakesh tour. I relented because she lives in Morocco and said we absolutely had to see the desert if we were going to see Morocco. I'm tremendously grateful for that leap of faith. I am quite sure we wouldn't have seen as much if we'd wandered aimlessly. ME is owned by an eco-conscious Canadian artist and a Moroccan with great insights into the country's culture and history. They're both incredibly open, professional, accommodating, and really love and care for Morocco. Our driver Hassan was lovely and funny too, he suffered nobly through my attempts to speak Arabic and was a very safe driver. The camel trek was awesome, in January I suggest a sleeping bag. The mountains, the Sahara, Agadir, the gorges, and kasbahs were gorgeous but the people were the best part. This is really a wonderful and well-run company for travelers who don't think of themselves as \"tour\" people and probably those who do."

I had never used a tour company as I like to plan my own trips, but after much research, I decided to rely on the expertise of people who really knew Morocco in a way that would take me years to learn. I picked Morocco explored based on reviews and also because one of the owners is Canadian so I could easily communicate with her by phone and ask her my many questions which she patiently answered. I was traveling with my 23 year old daughter and we wanted to explore as much as possible in 9 days. Robin planned an amazing trip, offering several options, and being flexible as I changed our itinerary at least twice. I wanted to spend at least 2 days in Fez, which meant one day in the desert, and Robin and the Moroccan guides explained many times that most people prefer the desert. We decided while in Morocco to change to that, and they were right- that part of the trip was incredible, well it all was, but that was like nothing we'd experienced before. The drivers and guides were all fantastic. they were all so knowledgeable, friendly, funny, and took us to so many places that we would never have seen on our own. They were also great drivers, which was important to me, as crossing the High Atlas Mountains was a bit scary to me.( I know you are laughing Hamou if you are reading this..) We experienced every type of accommodation, from a riad in a family home to a palace, to a Berber tent, to a wonderful riad in the Ouzoud Cascades. The day guides that Morocco Explored provided were fantastic, and our Marrakech guide invited us for a cooking lesson in his home when we returned to Marrakech at the end of our trip. We left feeling that we now have friends in Morocco, especially after our flights were cancelled due to weather in Europe and we got so much help from Esalah and Hamou, 2 fantastic people. After the trip ended we both felt like we learned so much and that we were so expanded from this experience. We felt that we more than got our money's worth from this very full experience that this company provided."

Our guides were Jamal and Mohammad...and they were wonderful! At first..we were a little apprehensive.....but Jamal and Mohammad were great. They made us feel at safe and welcome..they became our friends. We started out in Marrakech..drove down to Zagora ( the door to the Sahara ) and then took a two hour camel ride at sunset ( which turned into night..gorgeous..nighttime in the Sahara!!! it was surreal...) stayed in a tent..dinner and breakfast. ( and to top things off...I have food issues...and they even accommodated for that! ). then rode one hour back out to Zagora. We then drove home back to Marrakesh..stopping along the way anywhere we wanted. The guys were great! We had so much fun. When we talked to Jamal about other trips that we could do in Morocco...he said we could climb the Atlas Mountains..go trekking in the Sahara.. 4wd expeditions...they were open to anything. As two women traveling alone..we felt safe..and we would definitely do this again! I know that it can be kinda..scared to book something over the internet..and..not sure what you are doing...being that there is a language barrier..AND..how do I know what I am getting myself into? ...but I have to say..this is one of my best trips!

In respect of the tour itinerary, Hamoud was always prepared to go out of his way to either fit in extra things we wanted to do or stay longer in a particular place. He was such a likeable bloke and his knowledge of the country made us hire him for an extra day to take us to Chefchaouen. \u00a0As for the company itself, congratulations to being such a well run organisation and constantly ensuring that our needs and expectations were being met - well done Essalah and Robin.

Their approach is not to package, but build a trip around your requests - you tell them what you have in mind and they make suggestions for an itinerary to achieve it. We had a couple of days in Marrakech and then a four-day trip in an air-conditioned 4by4 over the Atlas mountains to the desert, and it was just right - safe but challenging. We stayed in varied yet always comfortable accommodation, and as well as the sites we had planned to go to, we were taken (with our agreement) to other interesting places that the driver's excellent local knowledge enabled him to recommend. Morocco Explored also work hard to make sure that the arrangements are successful - which cannot be assumed in a second-/ third-world country like Morocco. An indicator of the attention to detail was our visit for lunch to a cafe for what was promised to be - and was indeed - \"the best omelette ever\" (done in a tagine). When we arrived the cafe had run out of bread, but the Morocco Explored driver drove to the nearest village to buy some."

We found this company really good value for money and a good way to get the best out of your trip to Morocco especially if it's your first trip to Morocco and are unsure of what you want to see and do. The company we used Rough Tours 4 days/3 nightsWe only had a week but had a really good itininery and it took the hassle out of having to organise routes and such as it was all sorted for us. Our week went like this :pick up from airportWe had a day in Marrakech and a visit to places of interest with a guide, then we were taken to our Riad, which was of a high quality, but if you are looking for some where cheaper they will organise accommodation to your budget. Everyone was so helpful and friendly and our guide and driver went out of their way to ensure our trip had all the elements we had required.visit of ait benhaddou, along the route of a thousand Kasbah's, there may not have been a thousand to count but it was a good day and the scenery was amazing.Toudra gorges we stayed at a lovely small and friendly hotel with a great view of the gorge from the rooftop terrace. It was very Moroccan in style and we were made to feel welcome.We continued on our way with some off road driving stopping off at many Berber village which are off the tourist trail our favorite was Ramlia,very nice small Berber village where we were made very welcome with glasses of mint tea, a traditional welcome in the real Morocco. Then on to...-Merzouga for me the highlight of the trip as the camel trek was the big thing for me. We stayed overnight at small hotel setting off late afternoon to our camp in the desert where we stayed in berber style tents before setting off at dawn to see the sunrise in the desert, a magical experience, don't forget your camera. We arrived back at our hotel for a well earned hot shower and breakfast, before setting off to Ourzazate stopping off at Rissani market on the way. At Ourzazate we visited a film set, interesting to see the sets of some major films.Finally back to Marrakech for a last bit of shopping and an over night stay in a Riad before being taken to the airport for our flight home. Happy days."

We thought that the trip was extremely well organised and efficient and our guide (Selah) was excellent. Aside from his excellent command of english, we found him to be a veritable fountain of knowledge in terms of the scenery and local customs and nothing was too much trouble for him. We also really appreciated the fact that there was no pressure (unlike other guides in Morocco) to buy from the various shops or stops we made along the way and he took us to some excellent \"off the beaten track\" eateries where we ate like kings (the best omelettes ever) for a fraction of the cost when compared to some of the more \"touristy\" restaurants and the company and chat was great craic.One thing we did realise though was that a three day trip really isnt sufficient time for a journey of that magnitude, we covered something over 1000 kms in just three days and it was a lot of time spent in the four wheel drive, although it was a comfy enough drive and we were kept entertained by Sellah's musical choices. If we were to make a recommendation to anyone else considering a similar trip, we would definitely recommend that you take the four or five day option and spend less time in Marrakech. Overall, it was a pleasure and if you can get Sellah as your driver, you're sure of a fun trip and definitely no time for snoozing in the jeep."

            "review": "Morocco Explored Tour Company. Hi My girlfriend and I took 4 day (3 night) tour with Morocco Explored in December 2009.In brief, we enjoyed it and, based on our experience, we would recommend this company to others considering something similar.We have included a little more detail below for those that might be interested. Here is an outline of the itinerary:Fes - Erg ChebbiErg Chebbi - TinehirTinihir - Dades ValleyDades Valley - MarrakechWe were picked up in Fez by our driver and guide, Hamou. It was just the three of us though larger groups are catered for as our 4-wheel drive was quite big. The trip, by necessity, entailed a lot of driving \u2013 up to 8 hours a day - but this wasn\u2019t as bad as it might sound because there was plenty of wonderful scenery, frequent breaks to take photos and see sights and also because the conversation was good. Day one took in the somewhat unexpected alpine picture-postcard village of Ifrane, lunch at a lovely palatial affair in Azrou, the Ziz Valley with it\u2019s huge limestone walls with date palms following the path of the river below and, ultimately, the sand dunes of Erg Chebbi \u2013 our destination. From a hostel at the edge of the dunes we took a sunset camel trek into the desert stay overnight in a berber tent. This was the highlight of the trip \u2013 a combination of the beautiful quiet of the Sahara, swaying (lurching?) camels and our friendly guide (and cook and musician) for the evening, Mohammed. Our tent was comfortable and not nearly as cold as we thought it might be. And we got to see a great starry sky before it clouded over. Dinner was a hearty and tasty Tajine.Day two started with a dawn camel ride back to the hostel on the edge of the dunes. After a shower and a breakfast of orange juice, coffee, pancakes, bread and jam we were back in the car and heading to Tinehir. This included a visit to a market which may not have changed much since it began God knows how many centuries ago, a stop at a fossil workshop and a tour of the palmery at Tinehir by a local guide. The tour unfortunately culminated in us being taken to a house where we underwent a rather uncomfortable experience of being sold carpets \u2013 something we read about by another person who travelled with Morocco Explored. Hamou primed us in advance that this would probably happen but we would both have preferred for this not to be a part of the itinerary. Nevermind. Our hotel for the night was not bad, we were the only ones there I think until the arrival of a newly married couple for their wedding night!Day three and after a similar breakfast to yesterday \u2013 no sign of the newlyweds - we headed off to the Todra Gorge. It was ok but seemed a bit spoilt with a concrete road running through the bottom of it. Carrying on in through rugged terrain with occasional goat herds by the road or dotting hill sides we stopped off to see a nomad family which was wonderful and sad at the same time. We left thinking how much more complicated our lives were but how utterly poverty-stricken this family was. Before long we were on the roof of the car while Hamou drove us along. It was great waving to astonished kids as we drove through the craggy countryside trying not to slide off the roof. We finished up in the spectacular Dades valley which included a stop at a great restaurant perched over a fantastic view and finally our hotel by the river deeper in the valley. The hotel was more of a hostel in our view but the dinner was good and,before bed time, we were treated to an impromptu exhibition of drumming by a bunch of guys who may have known each other, maybe not, it didn't matter. The fourth and final day of our adventure started with the short trip to Hamou\u2019s family home for some tea. We met some of his family here and a few of the family\u2019s animals, which was good fun. Afterwards we headed to Ouarzazate where we took in the film museum (not bad) and then headed on to the nearby UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Ait-Ben-Haddou ksar (rather good). The final leg of the journey took us through the High Atlas with some spectacular views of snow-capped mountains before descending to Marrakech and the end of our journey. All in all, we had a good time. The price of the tour seemed expensive at 10500 MAD for both of us (though it turned out to be the cheapest of the tour companies we looked at). On the other hand we simply would not have seen or experienced what we did had we see tried to organise something ourselves. Also our guide, Hamou, was informative, interested in us, polite and friendly. There was a lot of driving but - as mentioned above -there were plenty of stops to stretch our legs, to take photos and to explore. And Hamou made good suggestions for places to eat. If you decide to give it a go hopefully you will have a good time too.Sanja and Chris"

They did a tour with Rachid who I emailed directly because of his excellent reputation. Unfortunately my dates didn't work for his own personal tour but after telling him my budget he promised me he would get me into another reputable group. When I met him after, he had an associate get me from my Riad to avoid confusion and he informed me I had paid an extra 300 Dirhams which was included in our agreed upon price for a different camp and accommodations than the rest of the group I joined. Wow was I EVER glad he did that. My camp was unreal with my own personal tent with a toilet and shower. I was quite shocked because I didn't expect much in the desert and for the price. The next morning I met back up with my group and their experience was very different than mine. They had shared accomodation and not very nice toilet facilities. They also had to be up really early and spend a few hours on a camel in the morning as well which , for me, the day before was enough. I was grateful to wake up, watch the sunrise at 7:10 and after breakfast had the option to take a jeep back into town to meet the rest of the group who weren't overly impressed with there camp. Thanks again Rachid, you rock and came through for me with an unforgettable experience at a very good price. I am not familiar with dealing with the rest of the company but if they are anything like Rachid they are very professional and really care about the clients experience!"

But...I have to remove a star because nothing was on time. I understand there were variables that could not be controlled (construction, etc.). However, the itinerary said that we would be back between 6-7pm but we didn't get back until 10pm. The reason was that we didn't leave Zagora on time (it was about 2 hours later than we had agreed). We also took an unexpected trip to a spice store and to a pottery store. Every time we stopped, the driver decided to have tea and a snack, so bathroom breaks turned into half an hour excursions. My sister and I had to cancel our reservations for a dinner show because the driver could not keep to a schedule. Also, we did not arrive to Zagora on time because the driver was late in picking everyone up. We had to take the camel ride in the dark - not exactly the trip I was planning. Every time I mentioned that we need to hurry up and get there, I was shut down and told to \"stop being fast fast like a Ferrari\" whatever that means. I am very type A, so maybe this trip would work for someone who is more relaxed, but it didn't work for me."

With a driver and guide, day 1 included a visit to the UNESCO listed kasbah at Ait Ben Haddou, which is worth a visit in itself. Just beyond the village of Tamagroute, we transferred from 4x4 to camel (dromedary, actually) for a short ride to the camp. Although just on the edge of the Sahara, Tinfou does include a small selection of dunes to give that authentic desert experience. We then settled into our tented camp for the night where we were the only paying guests which was wonderful and which included a fantastic authentic meal and drumming entertainment,The following morning, we climbed the highest dune to watch the sunrise and tried a bit of dune boarding, before breakfast perched on the dunes - what a wonderful memory. This was a well organised trip with the overnight experience well away from the main tourist destinations. There was the obligatory visit to a local community/collective pottery project in Tamagroute (thank you Tariq) but the pressure to buy was not too great and this added some interest to the experience.This was definitely an experience to remember. Thank you Rachid, Lahcen, Karim and Tariq."

Our driver was great, very experienced, communicative and friendly. His willingness to teach us about Morocco when we had questions combined with the experiences on the tour gave us a much better understanding and connection with Moroccan culture than we would have had otherwise. We also took the Essaouira tour, which again was super. Both tours were packed with experiences! Our drivers/guides were first class and the experiences were unique and memorable."

Less hassle from vendors although you need to keep your wits about you not to get drawn into unwanted activities such as henna tattoo or cuddling a snake. I felt safe everywhere and we did explore off the beaten track on occasions. Check prices of things like taxis before the start of activities. Beware non French or Arabic speakers - not all the taxi drivers speak English - thank goodness I had my daughter with me for the first taxi ride we took. The biggest con you are likely to experience is exchanging money at a UK airport. They quoted 8 dirham per \u00a31 but got 12 at Marrakech airport. Very easy and quick. We would have lost a third of our money. Change currency back at the same place as difficult to do so in UK. Also if you have the time do a two centre stay - Marrakech and Essaouira for instance - wish we had."

It was a beautifull trip, through the most beautiful drive to the different landscapes. Our guide, Youssef, was really a nice and fun guy. He drove safely and took the time at the places where we stopped. We never felt pressured (what we sometimes heated with bigger groups) and if we wanted to stop at other places was no problem. He also taught us more about the country. We booked this trip one day in advanced and Rachid replied really quick and was very friendly.The trip itself is worth going and we thought this company had a really good price for the amount of people you were traveling with. We started in Marrakech and wanted to finish in Fez. Only they found out the day before that our bus was not leaving to Fez until the evening. Racjid and Youssef did everything they could to arrange a other option (with more people in a taxi to Fez). So that was also a good service.The only thing i could think of is that with four persons in a car there is not too much space. So i hope for the bigger people they have bigger cars :pYes, like almost every organised trip abroad, this is very touristic. This means you get to places (restaurants, sights) there are lots of tourist. Touristic also means you get to see the most beautiful places. If you don't like this, you can better go private with or without guide.Thanks again Youssef and Rachid."

Booking with them was easy and they were always very open and kind to respond quickly to our inquiries. The tour we took included 3 days and 2 nights (one in the Sahara). Overall the route (Marrakech - Fes) is well planned and includes stops to admire the landscapes (kabasas, an oasis, impressive mountains, etc) but also to stretch your legs and have a cup of meant tea or eat :) The company booked in advance local guides which were very helpful. As to the camp site, it was spectacular and with luxury standards (electricity, shower, wc). It includes a camel ride from the road to the campsite and back. Bottled water is available to purchase on the camp. We got the chance to see the sunset and sunrise.... hands down it has been one of my best experiences.Special mention to our driver Kammal who was always very very nice, respectful and helpful."

As we didn't have enough time to go to Merzouga we found out that this was a way better option than Zagora which most companies offer. It's a bit further and you get less tourists and cooler dunes. The whole experience with Discover Morocco was amazing. From the time they picked us at the airport until they dropped us off there we felt really taken care of. Rachid is also very fast answering all kinds of questions as it felt at almost any time. We didn't hesitate to tell him any of our concerns. He was always very friendly and professional. On the day of the tour we had a very early start with Kamal, our driver and guide, who is an extremely cool and knowledgable guy, who even went out of his way for one of the meals, when we wanted to eat some sandwiches instead of sitting in a restaurant, and took us to a really nice snack place. I also got my best souvenir from the trip from him. You can ask him about it. The camp itself was amazing and Nordin (the chocolate guy as they call him) and the gang there made for a great reception and even lovelier night with drums, fire and star gazing. Thank you for everything."

They both exceeded our expectations and by the end of the trip we felt like they were both friends. Highlights were sleeping out under the stars in a comfortable bed (we wanted to sleep outside rather than in the tent-the tent was comfy but we really wanted to sleep under the stars!), the music by the fire and the delicious tagine we ate at the camp. I would say that if you get travel/car sick, make sure you have some medication as the roads can be bendy and bumpy!All in all, fantastic experience and we had non stop smiles throughout both days of the trip (even though one of us was ill!)"

Went to Morocco for the first time with one friend, having 10 days to spend along the southwest and a lot of options to choose from, when booking a trip to the desert.From the whole lot of offers, Morocco Discover Tours offered exactly what we wanted: 3 days trips, with plenty to see in a tight but flexible schedule, at what seemed a fairly reasonable price, at the moment. As I write this review, I actually think it was the best spent money in all the trip.Rachid is a young, funny and versatile guide. He will not just present you Morocco as it is written in the books or just point out through the window what you're supposed to watch... He actually teaches you the way of living in Morocco, the mixed cultures, the less turisctic aspects and has a fair share of surprises under the sleeve (have you ever heard about the Berber pizza?). We were actually very lucky to be able to travel in a small pack (5 tourists + Rachid + driver) - and after the first day together, you're like family! - since it gave us the chance to personalize the tour and discuss many options and places to visit. It was a great way to experience the desert, the mountains, the monuments, the people and end up feeling like you've grown a fair share of knowledge and a secret or two about the places you visited, after only 3 days. And for solid Rachid will be the guy who has your back: he'll make sure you have fresh food every day, he'll know where to stop, he'll know what to show you and you'll fell rewarded for your choice.I really hope to come back to Morocco to a Northern/East trip to explore more of this magnificient country... And I know I'll call Rachid.Safe trips!"

U will absolutely feel like Ur meeting a good friend instead of a tour guide. Our tour was couple days later with a bunch of other Canadians. It was great cause all of us got along great. He drove us through the high Atlas mountain and the mid Atlas. The views are stunning and he would stop frequently for us at good spots for pictures and as and when we needed a drink or to use the washroom. He is quite patient, I must admit because at times we did take our own sweet time with washroom breaks and he was totally fine with it. He is probably one of the few ppl I can say who has beyond excellent driving skills down winding roads, maneuviring with precision. That is how much of a careful driver he is. He has an exceptionally clean car with air conditioning and it's a brand new Ford, so very comfortable. He also made us an excellent sheesha and chilled with all of us, just cause we said we would liked to do that.

PS: if you're thinking of renting a car and head out to Merzouga on your own, I'd advise against. Me and my friend did so on another part of the country: money-wise it was practically the same but experience-wise we ended up missing some gems on our trip. Trust Rachid, he knows where to stop, he'll show and talk about all the hidden places, he'll make sure your food is fresh and you won't be tired from driving for hours and hours (which means you'll take more out of what he shows you)."

The trips can be tailored to your interests so make sure you talk to your guide and let them know if you do not want to do something. For example, we preferred to get back to Marrakech earlier rather than see the TV studios so we skipped that! They are not intrusive and will give you more/less information where you show interest. Read the small print - it is a long journey so be prepared to spend around 12 hours on the road although there are plenty of stops of interest along the way and lots of information from your guide. The guides speak multiple languages. Camping is in the desert and we had a tent to ourselves, food is great and there is music and a fire afterwards.

My 2D-1N at the desert birthday experience:Friends recommended me the tour with them, specially Rachid, and it was the best advice I have been given in various years. Rachid was very responsive and keen to help even from before we formally booked the trip, recommending hotels and everything. This would only increase and get better along the trip. He and Risham picked us up from the airport and got us to our hotel. Next day picked us up early morning for a nice history lesson along the way and along a great music mix of anything you can think of. We made a great bonding since the beginning and dance in the car and everything. Breakfast was perfect, Risham's driving was exceptional, Rachid's stories, history lessons, funny anecdotes and fun facts made our morning. We stopped couple times to enjoy the views of the mountains, Berber culture, etc. We enjoyed of the famous Ait-ben-haddou where we went to a Berber's house, saw techniques of art and a lot of time to enjoy and take pics. We then headed to the desert where it was one of my best experiences of my life. On my bday getting to a camel a ride it for 1hr+ then got treated like a king by very friendly, charismatic, funny, humble and most unique Berber people, specially Negrito por el mundo. We gave ourselves nicknames, made jokes, talked about life, etc. it was full moon amd the view couldn't get better. We had dinner made and served by the Berber, which was the best I ate at Marrakech, on top of a dune with wine which Rachid helped us picking. After that we had the bonfire and music. I engaged playing percussion and guitar and to be honest I felt home, like I was spending my bday with friends and family.For my surprise they started singing happy birthday in various languages and one of them picked me up to the restaurant and there was a bday cake. That reassured me that I was part of them and they were part pf me, as well that the decision to book this tour was the best decision ever. Next day woke up early, after sleeping well in the tent, to watch the sunrise and they got us a full-on breakfst. We made our way back to Marrakesh with some stops to see the culture, how the Berber made their living, etc. it all ended dropping us to the hotel. Next day they picked us up and dropped us at the airport. Finally, I will definitely recommend this experience to everyone I meet. And even to myself, bc we all need a break like this from the stress at work or simply life. I feel really grateful and blessed for the service, gifts and efforts done by Rachid and Risham. Will never forget what we lived through and it is virtually impossible to top this birthday trip. Thanks to both for everything and making me feel at home and with friends and family. Rauluy"

Youseff took care of us and we all really enjoyed this trip. I must say it was the best part of my 7 days in the country. We saw a huge part of Morocco, and end up in Merzouga desert that was even better than in the pics. It was a 2/3 days long trip where we ate with local people, dance, play music, talk and know by better hand the culture. It's a tour indeed for all the family, at it's not rough or too challenging. Maybe i missed a little bit that! :) A big huge to Youseff, and Rachid was at all time patience with me answering all my questions prior the journy. Reliable 100%"

Our two day tour from Marrakech to Tinfou Dunes with Mustafa was amazing!!The excursion was unforgettable and our trip to morocco would of not been complete without it. Rachid helped plan a perfect itinerary. He was quick with communication and planning via email which made everything run smoothly. Mustafa was our driver and tour guide. He was very friendly and knowledge about the areas we visited. The drive through the Atlas Mountains towards Tinfou Dunes really demonstrated moroccos beautiful landscapes. We had mini tours in historical sites like Ait Ben Haddou and the Draa Valley with very knowledge local guides. The highlight was visiting Tinfou dunes for a camel ride and camping in a berber tent. The night there was magical! Everyone at the camp was friendly and professional providing food and music to round out the night. Mustafa got us back to the city safely and it felt like we took a trip with a friend not just a tour guide. The whole team at DiscoverMorocco are excellent! I would recommend any excursion with this company when visiting morocco. I wish we could have done more trips with them!!!"

This was one of the best days we had in our 4 months studying and traveling. Our guide - Youssef - made it a day we will never forget. He was very kind and informative throughout the entire day. It was our first time in Africa, which we were a bit intimidated by travelling on our own, but he made sure we were comfortable and taught us so much about the Moroccan and Berber culture. It was both an adventurous day and a learning experience. I highly recommend this tour to anyone of any age. The only thing we regret is not having more time in Morocco to book more trips!

            "review": "Best Birthday Surprise EVER- Thank you, Rachid for making us feel so SPECIAL and LOVED ! Expectations exceeded !. It was my second trip in Morocco so i have a good base to compare and i must say Rachid exceeded my expectations and managed to make me and my partner feel so special...The first time I did this crazy road trip, we were with a local guide on a private tour which was quite exotic (think sleeping on an old carpet in the middle of the palm trees with the muddy river as our luxury swimming pool in hot August).I must admit I had reservations if the group tour would be as good as the private one (i am a fan of authentic experiences) but being on a very tight budget and with limited time to organize, I started contacting the best tour operators on Trip Advisor...All of them said they don't organize group tours which is quite understandable considering it's half the price... and just when i thought it's impossible to go to the desert for less than 350 euros per person, Rachid replied- YES and i was so happy and excited...120 euros for 3 days including petrol, 2 breakfasts, 2 dinners and 2 nights, 2 guides... sounded more than reasonable... He replied to all my emails very quickly and accommodated even the smallest request- from organizing vegetarian meals to recommending a good hammam for our last night in Marrakesh...What i didn't expect was the BIG surprise Rachid had prepared for my birthday... In a country where so many people try to take as much as possible from the tourists (understandably so as this is their main source of income) and during their high season, Rachid decided to reduce the initially agreed price by 50% purely because he couldn't be our guide (his group tour was cancelled in the last minute but he didn't cancel ours). On the morning when he came to pick us up at the agreed time , he gave me a beautiful silver necklace with Fatima hand which i felt protected me throughout the whole trip (totally unexpected as i am just a stranger, a customer who happens to have a birthday) and then announced that the last surprise is that instead of being in the camp with the 2 groups (which we later discovered had no toilet, running water or any facilities but tents with 6 mattresses), we will be alone in a luxury camp as a birthday present.... What an experience- just the two of us on the camels in the middle of the sand dunes watching the sunset, a whole camp for us with 3 friendly, welcoming people waiting to serve a beautifully presented, delicious 3 course meal that we were trying to finish as it was so good but we were too full just after the delicious starters... the tent had a king size bed, en-suite bathroom with hot water powered by the solar panels just next to the camp, everything was immaculately clean and it was our best night in Morocco (even if we stayed in good riads in Marrakesh)... Just the perfect 5* gateway - Desert Camp Bouchedor True, the private tour allowed more freedom to explore many places... but did I feel like a princess? We saw so many things- beautiful canyons, high cliffs, green mountains, the highest desert dunes, exotic palm gardens- a diverse landscape offering so much to photographers like us that we beat our own record with the 1600 photos taken in just 4 days :) recommend it ? absolutely, undoubtedly, totally YES ! For couples, for friends, for families, for solo travelers.... You will all have an experience that will stay with you long after you are back home.... so different from the all inclusive type of holiday when all you do is sunbathe, eat and explore the souks in Marrakech (not that this is bad- it's ok for people who need a total break from everything) .... but this will give you MEMORIES FOR LIFE.... truly magical..."

Our experience within this tour and thanks to our private guide Youssef Ait Addi was simply an unique life's experience. Our adventure started in Marrakech to end in Tinfou Dunes. During the trip we crossed a lot of beautifull places; and even if we needed to respect the timetable to arrive in time in Tinfou to see the sunset, our guide was placed to stop the car whenever we wanted to have some picture and have a walk in such amazing countryside. On the way we also visit many point of historical interest. When we arrived there were camels waiting for us in our camp into the Dunes. We spent an unforgettable night with the guide and the Berber Trib, who were singing and playing bongos for us. Your guide to the desert and the people who you gonna meet there will be part of your journey so is very important choose the right person. Thats why we want to recommend this tour and Youssef as your guide: he is a good speaker of English, a good driver, is very available to any request and he knows how to be professional and close at the same time. He is going to take care of you!"

Ishmael our guide spoke excellent English and made very well planned stops throughout the day. The evening with the Bedouin was great fun and we were surprised to have our own tent even though it was a group tour. The camel ride was good fun with the group. Being in a group wasn't a problem at all, I would definitely recommend this over a private tour, which is much more expensive. There were only 2things which were slightly disappointing: the food at the road-side stops was not very tasty, and tourists prices. Also the Tinfou Dunes are not massive, I was expecting Sahara-like landscape but the dune rises out of the flat rocky desert. But these things didn't ruin the trip and overall I would definitely recommend this tour. The Moroccans couldn't have made us feel more welcome and really made the experience enjoyable."

Rachid answered lots of questions by email and gave me some great advice and I chose a private tour to Tinfou. Rachid came with Kamar to meet us on the day of departure then we left with Kamar for the drive over the Atlas Mountains. The weather was quite bad and the snow got pretty heavy as we got higher. Kamar drove really well and was very patient when my daughter felt car sick. Eventually we were turned back as the snow had closed the road. So we regrouped and took another option to visit the waterfalls. The following day Rachid and Kamar took us to Essaouria for the day. We had a brilliant time. Rachid looked after us so well and organised a guide in Essaouria. He chose the best of the fish and seafood and had it cooked fresh for us. We all enjoyed an amazing lunch. It was a wonderful day with a lot of laughs and good fun. Rachid and Kamar are great guys who really look after their guests. We will return another time and definitely do that desert trip!!"

The duration of our trip was long, but to reduce boring discomfort, Rachid let us stop whenever we wanted to take pictures, go to the bathroom, or just to refuel our bodies for the duration of the trip. Never once did he make me feel rushed during our stops. When we arrived to our destination in the desert we kept our bags in his car so we wouldn't have to take them with us on the camel ride. After the camel ride he met us at our camp site right away and asked us how everything went. He seemed very receptive and intuitive to all of our needs and when we all wanted to have privacy within our group. On the trip back he was just as good about letting us stop whenever we wanted. He was always attentive and he never ceased to make my group and I happy, plus we all had good conversation with him. All in all the trip was excellent and I would recommend Rachid to anyone."

We were all in the same age.I like roadtrips and you drive a lot!!! For me it was the perfect way see the beautiful landscape of this country. Everyone in Marocco drives crazy. Our guide (forgot his name) was a very good driver. I felt nearly always safe except when he drove sometimes with 70 km/h just 2 m behind another car. But he saved our lifes as he evades very quick off the road as another car was falsely on our lane in a curve. That was very good, because the passenger airbags were turned off!!! We were also not allowed to turn them on!!! We did not get a lot of information about the country from our guide. Unfortunatelly I recognized only now that we neither visited the town Telouet nor the Atlas Film Studios!!! Instead we had lunch in overprized restaurants with dry chicken. Just at the third day we could conviced the guide to bring us to a local place. 6 people ate for the same price as one did in the other restaurants. He also brought us to shops, but himself bought his water and snacks somewhere else... this is embarrassing!!! We had also no chance to dicover A\u00eft-Ben-Haddou alone. We were pushed through the town by another guide without information.The first night was in a clean hotel. There was also a maroccan family and we did music until the night. This was very nice.I have no problem with stopping at local manufactures and cooperatives which want to sell blankets, argan oil and carpets, but then I also want to stop at a beautiful place to enjoy the landscape and do some photos.The tour to the berber camp by dromedary was organized very well. We had a spacious dinner with other young groups. Then there was music again but everything was agganged and inauthentic. We got very good information from the desert berber guide and enjoyed the incredible stars in the sky.The last day was just driving. I liked it, but we did actually just stopped for lunch.All in all a good way to see the country. I had a lot of luck with my group. The guide did a good job driving us around, but a very bad job giving us information about his country. That he also forgot to bring us to Telouet and the Film Studios brings me to the conclusion that I can not recommend this company! I also do not understand why the passenger airbags were turned of! An answer from the company would be nice."

The trip comprised of trekking in the High Atlas mountains and spending time in local Berber houses. The hospitality was amazing and the locals so friendly. Speaking little French or Arabic, we were still able to interact with the locals. My daughter had a wonderful time playing with the village children. Overall, I feel that Discover Morocco offers us a peace of mind. no worries about pick up from the airport, getting from A to B, accommodation and what we are going to eat on a daily basis? its all pre-arranged to your personal preference. Personally, for me this is my ideal holiday/break. It takes you away from the daily routine of work etc in your normal daily life and truly gives you that relaxation that you need when you getaway!

After a few discussion we agreed for a 2 days trip to Tinfou Desert and 1 day trip to Setti Fatma Waterfall.Both tours were great and one of the main reason for having this nice time was also our driver/ guide Youssef \u201cScorpion\u201d. Our experience did not start perfect in Marrakesh as we had to wait almost 3 hours at the passport control in airport. But Youssef was still waiting for us and he did not even received our SMS in which I was trying to let him know it will take a long time to get out from the airport.The road to the Tinfou Desert is long. So be prepare for a long drive but there are stops on the way were you can enjoy nice sceneries, villages and also there will be breakfast and lunch breaks.In the last day we enjoyed a lot the visit we made to the traditional Berber house and the breakfast was wonderful.I was together with 3 girls (one teenager) and we did not had any kind of problems. Marrakesh city was also a really nice surprise (except Medina part that was too crowded for us and did not spend much time there).Thanks again Rachid and Youssef and hope we manage to see each other again in the near future."

            "review": "Amazing Driverguide and Great Experience!. We chanced upon their website and decided to try their 2D1N Marrakech private tour. Rachid was quick to reply and I had a very smooth pre-trip arranging for this tour. Our driverguide for the trip, Abdellatif, was really amazing as well! He was super humorous and informative, and we were very entertained by him throughout the tour. He spoke good English, and was accommodating to stopping the vehicle whenever we want to take photos(: He was also great in giving food recommendations. We tried all the exotic food he recommended and were not disappointed! Sunrise, sunset and the night sky were gorgeous too.Everything about this tour was great except for a small incident: After the nomad camp stay, we were brought to a mini pottery tour. Everything was great until the pottery tour guy explicitly asked for tips when we refused to buy any souvenirs from him. It was quite ridiculous because he had this small talk with us the previous night, saying stuff like he just wants to make friends and not be concerned about money. And in less 12 hours he's asking us for money?!That aside. I would strongly recommend this tour to people visiting Morocco! (but we felt that 2D1N was a litte too short)"

When my friend and I decided to take a tour to the desert while visiting Marrakesh, we got overwhelm by the tons of offering available in the market. After reviewing some of the options, we decided to book a 2 days desert tour with Discover Morocco Day Tours as its review were quite nice and the price was very competitive. Communication was very good before the trip.The day of the tour, we got pick up at our Riad right on time and transportations was very comfortable. Rachid was with us all the time and he proved to be very knowledgeable regarding the different points of interest and the berber culture. When we got to the desert, we were immediately greeted by our rides, in other words, Dromadaires. The \"camel treck\" lasted around 1 hours and allowed us to enjoy the beautiful sunset and the moon coming up. Priceless! After the camel ride, we got to our camp that it was run by nomads. They prepared delicious food for us! We also gather by a bonfire and dance to the rhythm of their drums and other musical instruments. I had so much fun, that the night passed by so fast. I would definitely won't forget that night.On our way back we visited Kasbah, which is a famous location where movies are filmed. If you have seen movies like Cleopatra, Gladiator, just to mention some of the bunch, you have definitely seen this on the tv or movie screen. It was surreal been there.My friend and I had one of the most wonderful experiences and were very please that we pick this tour company for our desert experience. Rachid was always going the extra mile. Definitely, the best tour guide that I have ever had. Totally would recommended this tour!"

We have signed up for a group tour but ended up with a private tour, which was definitely a bonus. The trip does involve lots of driving but our drive made it easy by constantly telling us about the landscapes. The desert was well worth the drive. We were also not forced to buy anything which we felt might have been asked if we had taken other tours in Morocco.For its price, I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone going to Morocco!"

Prior to booking this trip, my friend and I searched many companies offering a very similar experience throught the Atlas Mountains and Zagora Desert. Several were far more expensive and seemed to offer the same exact thing. After reading reviews, pricing and communicating with the others, we chose Discover Morocco Day Tours and the 2-day Tour to the Desert. Rachid was fantastic in completing our booking, confirmed with us the day before and was punctual when he sent for someone to pick us up promptly the morning of the tour. Our guide, spoke fantastic English, had a great sense of humor and was incredibly knowledgeable of every town and culture of the \"Berbers\". The first stop was in Ait Berka for Breakfast of which was a cute spot with fantastic tea and coffee overlooking the mountains, next we passed through Aglmous Village then stopped for lunch in Ourzazate. The drive continued through the vast mountain range passing through Ait Souen, Agdez, Zagoura City and then we arrived in Tinfou Desert. Upon arriving in Tinfou Desert we were immediately greeted with two Dromadaire (Camels with one hump not two) I quickly learned! Lol. We rode them for about 45-60 min and our guide for the ride was adorable he would stop in several spots to take pictures of us. As the sun came down it was quite unique to see the moon coming up over the mountains at the same time. As the ride concluded we were greeted by our tour guide and the Berber community at this camp. We had a great dinner, bonfire, music (they are so talented!) and slept in a tent. In the morning, we were served tea/coffee and pastries before we hit the road. On the way back we stopped in Kasbah for lunch and the tour of a famous location where many movies were filmed. In fact, they were filming one while we were there. The village is elevated of what appears to be in a mountain and centuries old that certainly takes you back! It was a wonderful and very memorable experience and I would certainly do it again! Thank you Rachid for your wonderful hospitality and for making this experience possible!"

I have chosen this travel agency after all great review on Tripadvisor.I was ready to pay more, and when you are ready to pay more YOU MUST READY TO RECEIVE MORE\u2026Unfortunately it did not happen and besides the service received, also the tour itself, it is not such a great tour,At the end I would say, be ready to find the cheapest tour as all of them offer the same service, at least you will not feel robbed.Here my personal comments1) The promised English speaking guide turned out to be an elementary English knowledge guide.2) As the lunch was not included, I would expect to have the possibility either to eat with the entire group or to eat somewhere else, or go for a walkHe always took us in the restaurants he wanted without giving us any alternative. On the way back we stopped for Lunch in a stranded place, in the middle of nowhere.Therefore no other places, or possibility to do something different.3) We were promised to have a private tent, for 2, when we arrived the guardian told us that all of tent are for 4 people and he would not have cared.Besides he was smoking JOINTS..yes JOINTS...he even asked my gf a rolling paper, in front of us, and the guide left us to go to the camp on ourselves with locals without any support. At least he would had came with us and check if everything was fineBefore leaving all group alone. We were told: other companies are cheaper because they offered tent for 8 people. The real truth is that ALL TENT ARE FOR 4\u20264) Food quality in the desert is really poor from Dinner to Breakfast5) You ride the camels just before the sunset is over.6) The camp is just located on the border of the desert just a couple of Dunes, if your expect to be surrounded by Dunes, forget it7) Ait Ben Haddou, the only place, which was worth visiting and maybe staying there to have lunch walk around, I gently asked: why do not we have lunch here? The guide answer: because we take you to a placeWhich we trust\u2026.well we ended up in a small caf\u00e8/restaurant in the middle of no where\u20268) The tour should be tailored IN A BETTER WAY\u2026I talked to Rachid and he offered me a compensation of 400 Dirham, which was a good-gesture form his side, and he felt sorry, however instead of the compensation he tried to offer me a complimentary taxi to the airportAffirming that for a transfer to the airport at 04.30am next morning, would had cost euro 30/35\u2026well I gently denied his offer and I took back the 400 Dirham, in fact the taxi cost me JUST 70 DIRHAM/7 euro\u2026At the end I would suggest, if you really want to make this kind of trip (I will not do it again even for FREE..LONG DRIVE..all curves/bends), check for the cheapest company which offer you the same tour for 50/55 euros. You can also have (asking) the transfer from airport upon arrival to your accommodation. At least you would not be disappointed with all great expectations."

My boyfriend and I booked the 3 day Desert Tour with Rachid after we compared many different tour & excursion companies online. Not only was the price the best out of 6 that we asked, Rachid was the only one who was patient with all of our questions and emails. You'll be amazed by how fast he replies! The trip was amazing from beginning to end. On our first day, Rachid came and picked us up from our riad on time like he said, helped carry our heavy backpacks to the car, introduced us to the friendliest driver, and our wonderful journey begun. Every stop we made on our way to the Sahara was amazing. Rachid would explain the area and sites to us, give us as much time as we like to explore the place, and even help take wonderful photos for us. & because of Rachid, we also met some of the most amazing people, including the local Nomads, Berbers, and our camel ride guide Hassam. By the end of this tour, we truly became good friends and promised he'll always have a place to stay if he came to visit us in Canada! If you are considering any type of excursions or tour in Morocco, definitely go with Discover Morocco Tours! After a long 3 weeks of visiting Italy, France, and Morocco, my boyfriend and I both agree that the 3 day Desert Tour was definitely the best part of it all. Thank you again, our Moroccan brother Rachid!"

Our guide Abdel was amazing - his knowledge of the Morrocan history and landscape was astounding. Not to mention he was a really fun guy. To top it all off, after the tour, Rasheed, the owner, invited us into his home for dinner (homemade Tagine). It was clear this was way more than a business transaction to them. We made friends that we still keep in touch with to this day. Do yourself a favor - if you visit Morocco, take a tour with them. You won't regret it."

They use local guides on the different locations to show you around. It were both private tours with a comfortable car and Youssef as a responsible and polite driver.Besides that, it felt like we made new friends.

My wife and I visited Morocco for the first time and we booked the 2 day Sahara tour with Discover Morocco based on the excellent reviews online and our own experience is no different. From the moment we sent our inquiries, Rachid was very prompt in answering all our many questions before we even booked their service. We are very pleased we decided to go with Discover Morocco. From the time we were collected in our Riad at Marrakech, to our many significant stops at the Atlas Mountains, Rachid made everything as smooth as possible, he was very knowledgeable, flexible with the schedule and our route. Each step of the tour has its unique and amazing impact on me and my wife. Particularly noteworthy to us is how Rachid involves locals outsourcing so they would also earn and the local economy benefits. We stopped at a local cooperative at the Atlas mountains, Rachid worked with locals in the Sahara, from the camel ride guides, to the nomad camp where we stayed. On the way back the following day Rachid involved another local guide when we stopped at Ait Ben Haddou. We had an amazing time from start to finish. We learned a lot from Rachid, met amazing people, partake into the local culture and totally enjoyed the sights and sound of the Sahara. First hand experience from picking dates from trees, stopping at Henna farms and showing us some local cotton trees. I rarely give a 5 star rating. Discover Morocco has exceeded my expectations and deserves the 5 star rating. Its all worth it. If we are to have another trip to Moroccco I would not have second thoughts booking another tour with Rachid."

Rachid was a wonderful guide and went out of his way to make the whole journey as interesting and personally tailored as possible. Our first day we drove through the Arlas mountains and filled our eyes with amazing sights. We also stopped at a woman run Argan cooperative and my biggest regret for the trip was I didn't bring cash to buy the products - they were amazing and the woman who showed us the process was very informative. You cannot believe it but we actually got rained out of the Sahara desert the first evening so we could not to ride the camels to the camp but Rachid rearranged for a dawn ride which was amazing! In stead we had impromptu delicious tea at his friends house and shop and then we drove to camp where we honestly ate the best Tagine we've ever tasted. We were serenaded by drumming and songs by a campfire under stars that night. And we woke up the next day to watch the sun rise from the top of a sand dune - and of course ride the camels! The second day was equally fantastic - Rachid stopped to buy us the best dates from the Draa Valley and we even stopped and picked them fresh off the trees. We also visited Ait Ben Haddou and had a personal tour of it and inside a local home. At all times Rachid was full of local and personal knowledge about the Berber people and culture, and ever ready to answer my many questions. We can't thank Rachid enough for our amazing time! We will definitely be back!"

From the moment, we landed in Marrakesh, we were well looked after by Discover Morocco . The friendliness and hospitality was really lovely especially since we were travelling with our children. The whole booking and organisation of the tour was really good. Also, I feel what made it so special is that our input of what places we wanted to visit was taken in account. A copy of the Lonely planet was good to have as a guide when discussing with the tour operators of what and where to go!Overall, we travelled north to Fez visiting many places en route with plenty of breaks which made it quite a chilled out experience. It didn't feel that you were always in the car! Amazing views we saw as we took the Atlas mountain scenic route.Two days in Fez was wonderful. To experience the wonderful historical and cultural experience with our city tour guide. Quite a contrast from the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh. In my opinion, Fez was quite laid back and relaxing while staying in a beautiful Riad in the old Medina. Our journey took us south to the Merzouga desert with daily activities en route. Observing the monkeys and horse rides. Again, the journey was long but well-planned so there were sufficient breaks to relax with the locals. I've experience desert camping before but Merzouga experience was out of this world. A camel ride to our camp, which took 2hr and then greeted with Morocco Tea on arrival. The food was like a banquet and the accommodation was clean with excellent bathroom facilities. The camp fire and the singing was uplifting to experience.The rest of the tour involved travelling west back to Marrakesh. Gorges, mountain villages etc. After an overnight stay in Marrakesh, we were travelled for a few days to Agadir which was arranged by us but, Discover Morocco arranged the transport.. Since, we travelled from London to Marrakesh, we had our outbound flight from Marrakesh. we phoned Discover Morocco who arranged transport back to the airport.what more can I say except I'm going back at Christmas!!!!!"

We were collected at our hotel by Abdull spot on 8am and taken to our transport for the day. He was great at explaining what we were going to do and in what order and sharing information as we went.Our first stop was at a Berber house for breakfast, I am always sceptical about these types of visits as ones I have been to in the past feel like set up houses but this felt so real. We wandered down a path through a gate in a wall and were inside a little compound, the family greeted him as a long lost friend and there was a genuine warmth on both sides. He showed us their personal Hamman and how they would light the fire to heat the water for it, onto the animal area where there were a couple of cows and a week old calf. Back to the house and he showed us where the stream outside had been channelled through the wall for washing and then into the kitchen area. The cooking area was two open fires where pots, tagines, trays could be placed over them. We were taught how to make mint tea, which was lovely and watched as our bread was cooked on the open fire. It was served with butter from the cow we had just seen and was like cottage cheese in texture and just the most amazing taste, there was honey (local and the most amazing ever) and olive oil. I could have stayed there all day eating that!Then on to our camel ride, just 20mins and to be honest that was enough to say we had tried it, Abdull took some great photos of us and we had a little caravan going as there were 3 camel calves that wandered along with us. The owners were lovely and also took photos and encouraged us to hold the camels while they did, no hint for tips simply nice people. On to the Atlas Mountains and we met another guide who trekked with us up through two villages where we had lunch at the 3rd on a balcony with amazing views. More mint tea and a tagine as requested by Abdull when we expressed an interest in them.On the way back to Marrakech we stopped for our quad biking, which was fun but the goggles are not that clean so a bit hard to see through at times.When we got back to Marrakech as we were not sure how to get back to our Riad from where we had parked Abdull walked back with us without hesitation. We were contacted by Rachid afterwards to make sure we had enjoyed our day and offering a free airport transport if we wished, having already arranged the hotel we declined but otherwise it would have been brilliant. All together we had been out from 8am to 6.30 by the time we got back, what a day!"

We left early in the morning and arrived in Tangier by mid-morning. Not having selected a tour guide beforehand, upon our arrival we were greeted by several industrious but questionable people. But then an middle aged man approached us and assisted us navigating our way through customs. He showed us his credentials and we decided to use him as our tour guide. His name is Foad Bssari from Discover Morocco Tours. Foad proceeded to take us on a wonderful all day tour of Tangier. His English is excellent and he was not at all pushy. We had a magnificent, thoroughly enjoyable and easygoing, walking and driving tour for 6 hours or so. Our experience in Tangier wound up being one of the highlights of our entire vacation. We saw local markets, religious and cultural sites, did some sightseeing, a little shopping (where we picked up some amazing, authentic Moroccan spices that we cherished and enjoyed when we returned home), and had delicious coffee (the only thing we were brave enough to drink or eat while we there) at a local coffee shop. I cannot emphasize enough how wonderful Foad was with us. He is a true gentleman and a great ambassador for Tangier. I look forward to returning to Tangier and using him again."

Ouidad (i hope that is how her name is spelt), is an amazing tour guide, her English is brilliant, and she constantly asks if there is anything we need to know. Our group consisted, of myself an my wife, a group of 3 from USA, Ouidad and the driver. The vehicle used was brilliant, enough space for all, and powerful AC!We were picked up on time and then we went off on the tour, seeing the tombs, the palace, the gardens and many other things too.Lunch is provided on the tour, but I would not call it a lunch, its a FEAST, there was enough food to feed a small army, from little tapas plates of pickles, to breads and olives. Then the main course, then the dessert, then fruit, then tea. Simply amazing. Ouidad also took us to several shops that only the Moroccan use, where we got a few bargains, cheaper then the Souks.We cannot thank Rachid enough for this tour and in general for all the help with other things. He arranged to pick us up and take us to a Beautiful Hammam place, all off his back.Thank you Rachid for an amazing tour and for everything else. You are a great credit to your business."

This 3 Day trip to the Sahara was the highlight of our holiday. The guides were fantastic. They were professional, knowledgeable and really friendly. The 7 seater van we traveled in was brand new, spacious and air conditioned. The food was tasty and the accommodation was comfortable. We stopped off anywhere we wanted along the way to take pictures or stretch or legs. One of the best stops was A\u00eft Benhaddou. We got to walk through the old city and got loads of pictures. The night in the desert was filled with entertainment and food and yes there yes there are full toilet facilities at the camp :-)On the final day we were dropped right to our accommodation in Marrakesh and Rachid even had a parting gift for us, as myself and my girlfriend had gotten engaged earlier in our trip.

We travelled quite a lot of KMs in 2 days visiting UNESCO heritage sites and many other. The final destination was Zagora desert where we stayed in a camp overnight - good food and wonderful experience.I would surely recommend this tour from Rachid as it is not only cheaper than others but very personalised and friendly as well."

My colleagues from the travel industry recommended Discover Morocco and we booked three trips with them. That was definitely the best decision, as we had a fabulous time with our guide Rachid and our driver Essaleh there. Both were very professional and disposed of a huge knowledge about the country, culture, history and locals and revealed a great sense of humor. Especially the fact that on all three tours it was only the two of us and no big groups was a huge bonus. Our trip to Morocco was my first, but certainly not my last one there... If anyone intended to travel to Morocco, I would definitely advise to book their tours with Discover Morocco, especially if anyone is looking for a tailor made, private tour. Even if there might be other companies which offer their trips for less: I doubt they can offer the same professionalism - Some I kept track on myself and they were noncompetitive by far and even gave wrong information about history and culture."

We booked a 2-day tour from Marrakech to Zagoura desert with Rachid. It was a great experience, from the minute we were picked up at the riad we were staying at, to the drop off in Essaouira. Rachid and his colleague did everything and beyond to make us comfortable and to show us as much of Morocco as possible. We not only visited the major sights, but also got an insight into the lives of local people, local cuisine and customs. The night in the desert was amazing! Tents were big and comfortable, we even had regular bathrooms, all in the middle of the desert. This review is long overdue, but to summarize, I warmly recommend Rachid and his Discover Morocco Tours agency. Next time, I would book a longer tour with them!"

Our 12 year old son is adventure mad but our 9 year old daughter is very shy and wasn't sure about the walk in the valley. Both had a fantastic time. We stopped at a Berber house first where Rachid explained the various rooms in the house and talked about the Berber people. We also went on a short camel ride which delighted my daughter.The walk through the valley to the waterfall was amazing. Rachid hired a fantastic guide for us who held our daughter's hand right through every tricky bit and made sure she was completely safe. We asked to turn back at one point, thinking it was getting too much for us, but he assured us that she could do it and she was SO glad she carried on! The views were spectacular and our son is now desperate to come back to Morocco to properly tour the country.Rachid was extremely efficient, from the first email to enquire about prices through picking us up from our riad. It's always a bit nerve wracking booking an unknown guide, but I would highly recommend Rachid. He made both children (and us!) very happy.(I have photos which I will add later!)"

We were fortunate to have Abdul as our driver and Rachid as our guide. The excellence of our tour started from the time we landed. Although we were only due to start our tour on the following day, Rachid arranged for us to be picked up from the airport and he also ensure we were brought to our hotel. He told us what time he would arrive the next morning and also kindly offered his personal contact number just in case we got lost in Marrakesh that afternoon. We started our tour travelling in a comfortable SUV car and I must compliment Abdul on his excellent driving even on the curve roads along the Altas mountains. There is quite a bit of travelling by car throughout this tour to get from one town to another however the end destination is always worth the long journey. Rachid would give small talks along the way while we drove in perfect English. As the tour was private , the start timings each day was flexible and we could ask to stop along the way at scenic places if needed. Off the road, Rachid is happy to share more about the local experience in Morocco - more of the current picture rather than the history which one can easily read off the internet. Hence why the title the Real Morocco as it was interesting to learn about Abdul and Rachid perspective of current issues. They were also always happy to answer any questions we have about the country and its culture. The choice of hotels during the tour were also fantastic - each having its own charm. The highlight of the tour for me had to be driving through the Altas mountains and seeing its majestic views - although slight warning to those who are prone to motion sickness that it might be a difficult ride. The overnight stay in the desert is also a once in a life time experience which I highly recommend. To end of our visit to morocco, Rachid extended his generosity on our last night back in Marrakesh with a home cook tagine meal and freshly brewed mint tea. This was not on the tour outline but an extension of friendliness of our guide. Overall, this is a fantastic tour company to go with if you want to experience the real and amazing morocco. Our group of 4 girls always felt safe on the tour and Abdul and Rachid made it their personal mission to keep us entertain during the long car rides and well feed with good moroccan food. I would highly recommend this tour ! Thank you Discover Morocco!"

We took a full day trip with Raschid to the UNESCO world heritage site of Ait Benhaddou, along the Tizi-n-tichka pass, stopping at Berber Villages and Kasbahs along the way. I had asked Raschid quite last minute about the final dates and time for the trip and he was very flexible and prompt in all his replies and planning. Even though he was not well, he still came personally and showed us the wonderful countryside around Marrakesh. He was extremely knowledgeable and shared a lot of local insight about Morocco, the culture and the areas we were visiting. We had a great time, and would highly recommend this trip for any excusions in the Marrakech region."

We had a great trip to Marrakech, staying in a Riad in the Medina (Riad Noura), then travelling across the Atlas Mountains to the Saharah, riding on camels ad camping in the desert. We then stayed at the Kenzie Menara. Our whole trip was made easier and better by Rachid and his colleague and driver. Rachid organised a transfer from the airport on arrival which really helped us. He then took us on a trip in his 4x4 SUV to the desert which included all meals, overnight camping and the camel ride. We were given lots of interesting information and taken to lots of interesting sites such as an ancient hill town made from mud blocks, an old Foreign Legion fortress, film studios, Argan oil producers and many more besides. I would very strongly recommend Rachid because he was so helpful and supportive. We got far more out of the trip with Rachid's great help. It was excellent value for money as well. Liam"

We chose the one night/two day trop from Marrakech to Zagoura desert. The whole trip was amazing. Rachid made us feel so welcome and within no time at all we felt very at ease in his company. We took the trip up over the mountain road and stopped off at a great little place for coffee. We then went on to see how the Argon oil is made. I bought some shampoo, which I can confirm does amazing things for your hair!! We then travelled on, stopping off at lots of places on the way for photos and then on to Ait Ben Haddou, where a fantastic guide had been arranged for us. The whole place is utterly amazing and well worth the visit. The camel trip into the desert was an interesting one. I am used to riding horses, but this was an entirely different experience. The camp was brilliant. The tents had proper beds and were beautifully decorated on the inside. Dinner was absolutely lovely and the music and dancing very entertaining. Waking to watch sunrise was very special. We were sad to say goodbye to Rachid and the driver, both of which had been really good company over the two days. I would definitely recommend using this company!"

The van was comfortable, hotels was good, and the food was also good. Lah'san was very friendly and helpful as well.It was unforgetable experience for staying one night in the tent, in the middle of the desert and very wonderful sky at night.

It was a great trip. Rachid and his friend picked us up in the Medina at 7 am we then drove through the Atlas Mountains with plenty of stops for the kids. We visited a Berber village where we had a lovely lunch. We then drove to the desert through incredible scenery. We had an hour long camel trip to the tents and then returned to Marrakech the next day. They were great hosts very friendly, and good with children. We found it really interesting hearing about Morrocan culture and way of life. They also introduced us to some great music. Highly recommended if you are staying in Marrakech to get out of the city and see rural Morocco. Also if you are travelling independently they arrange for a driver to meet you at the airport which makes for a very easy start to the holiday. Nothing was too much trouble and they did their best to make the trip as interesting and comfortable as possible. Also we felt 100% safe - no need to have any concerns about leaving the city. Happy to answer any questions. Thanks again Rachid. Cath, Liam, Dom and Ollie."

We were initially drawn to the tour due to the variety of activities, all within one day, and the reasonable price (I did not come across any other tours like this whilst researching online). From the moment I enquired about the tour, Rachid was incredibly helpful and not only booked us in on the day we had suggested but also arranged to meet us at the airport on our arrival (despite arriving two nights before the date of the tour).

            "review": "Believe the reviews... this really is the best tour company we came across in Morocco. We took a 1 night excursion to the town of Mhamid which is situated south of the Atlas mountains and is the last town before the Algerian border. It was a truly unforgettable experience and I highly recommed Discover Morocco Tours. We paid 4,600 Dirhams (about 460 Euros) for two people in cash because paying by card would have incurred an extra 45 Euros charge from the bank in Morocco. Our only recommendation to Discover Morocco Tours is to try and find a way to reduce the commission as paying by card would have been so much easier and convenient for us. A few days before, we had gone on a terrible excursion with one of the cheaper tour companies to the Ourika valley and completely regretted it. They just wanted us to spend money at many stops and didnt care about our experience. Discover Morocco Day Tours on the other hand, was the opposite! Rachid is very friendly, knowledgeable and keeps his promises. Rachid and his driver picked us up at 7am as promised. The journey through the Atlas mountains is long and heavy going, but his land cruiser is very comfotable and it made the 10 hours (in one day) a lot more bearable. We took many bathrooms stops and the cultural stops were insteresting and there wasn't any pressure to spend money. The scenery on the way to the desert is just stunning.When we arrived in M'hammid (around 5pm) we were greeted by Ismail, one of the Berber guides. We went by camel into the desert and arrived at the berber camp in time for sunset. Needless to say we took many (many!) photos. There was full moon and the peace and light of the desert is something everyone should experience!Ismail served us tea when we were finished with our photo taking and he seemed genuinely interested in talking to us. His helpers cooked us a tasty tangine and the singing began to the beat of the African drum. We had our turn on the drums and didn't do quite as well but it was fun and we had a lovely evening. The boys then took our beds out of the tent and we slept in the open air. Again, magical, romantic.... we loved it! We set the alarm for sunrise (6am) and after taking so many photos of the morning light on the dunes (again, stunning!) we headed back to M'hammid town on our trusty camels and then onto Marrakech by car. We were truly exhuasted on the journey back but Rachid couldn't have been more kind, helpful and attentive. Thank you Rachid for being an honest and accomodating guide. We highly recommend this tour company!"

            "review": "Great trip with Brother Rachid. After deciding on Morocco for our honeymoon, we knew we wanted someone to take us around the city of Marrakech and the countryside of Morocco. Reading the reviews on TripAdvisors, we found nothing but great reviews on Discover Morocco Day Tours and a guide named Rachid. I had emailed many different tour groups in Morocco and Rachid was the first to get back to me. Not only the first time, but ever time we emailed him with any questions, he would get right back to us without hesitation. I found that very comforting in a tour guide. From the day we got there, Rachid was waiting for us at the airport with a sign that had our name on it. He gathered our bags and we were off. From the moment we met him, we knew that we were in good hands. After a brief ride through the city, we arrived at the Souks where our Riad was located. Instead of dropping us off to find our way, Rachid walked us through the labyrinth of Marrakech markets to our hotel. On our walk, we mentioned that we wanted someone to take us through the Souks and he said that he would take care of it. Sure enough, the next morning we had a lovely gentleman named Mohammad waiting for us at our hotel to tour us through the Souks. It was an extra charge for the tour through the souks but well worth it. Mohammad spoke perfect english and was very informative as we toured.The next day, Rachid arrived promptly to our Riad at 7:20am for our Sahara Desert adventure. We jumped in the very clean and comfortable LandCruiser and were off! The journey to the Sahara was a long ride (about 8-10 hours) but the scenery was breathtaking. We drove over mountains that could rival the Colorado Rockies and next to cliffs that resembled the Grand Canyon. We stopped plenty of times for bathroom breaks and places that Rachid thought we would find interesting. We also stopped for a delicious lunch that was included in our package. Finally we arrived at the Sahara Desert (make sure you have plenty of water!) and our next mode of transportation, camels! Rachid and the driver let us out and we were then led by the Berber people on camel back to our camp site. Rachid and the driver drove themselves and all of our luggage in the car to the campsite. That was very nice because our other camp mates had to carry their own. The camel ride was about one hour through scrub and up and down sand dunes. It was beautiful and so much fun.After a lovely night sleeping under the stars (we pulled the beds out of the tent), we had an early start back in the car with Rachid and the driver. We skipped the camel ride back to the town and just got back in the car. Rachid had even more points of interest to show us on the drive back. We stopped at Ait Ben Addouh and took a great tour of the Kasbah, dozed off and on in the car and before your knew it, we were back in Marrakech. Rachid dropped us off at our next hotel, we said our goodbyes. It was hard to part ways after such a great couple of days! There is nothing better than taking a shower after a night in the desert. Once we had rinsed off at the hotel, we had to begin to make plans to get to the airport a couple days later. Our hotel was going to charge us 30 Euros for 5 minute ride to the airport. Obviously we did not want to pay that so I emailed Rachid to ask him what we should pay a taxi driver to get to the airport. Of course he got right back to us and said that he would send a driver and not to worry about what it costs. It was such a kind gesture to take of us like that. We did tip the driver but it did not seem necessary.All in all, Rachid literally was like a guardian watching over us the whole time we were in Morocco. He treated us like family. Even though we always felt safe, it was nice to have Brother Rachid looking out for us in such a foreign country. He said that once you do a trip to the desert, you are now family and that is why he will always be Brother Rachid to us. We highly recommend booking any tour with Rachid. He will exceed your expectations and made our trip to Morocco an incredible, once in a lifetime experience!"

As 4 females, we felt safe and confident walking around the Souks, seeing the day come to life - most fascinating. We also took in the Majorelle Gardens (Yves San Laurent's), a much welcome oasis amongst the heat and speed of pace in the Medina. Our second day, was a trip out through the Atlas Mountains to Ait benhaddou. With Rachid as our guide, we were well looked after with plenty of water, photography stops and local information (and much laughter!) We spent time at the Kasbar (walking shoes essential), with amazing views across the desert land and mountains. We also had the privilege of finding more out about the Berner culture from our guide. We really would recommend Discover Morocco-tours to anyone visiting this beautiful country. Thank you again Rachid for taking such good care of us, Gemma, Tristen, Sara and Lisa :-) x"

We met some people in our Riad who had booked this tour (two nights and a camel trek into the Sahara), and the day before they were set to leave, I phoned Rachid and asked him if we could come along. They managed to fit us in with no trouble whatsoever, much to our delight! Our guide for the trip was actually Kamal who was absolutely brilliant. As other people have said, nothing was too much trouble and we were able to stop whenever and wherever we wanted to. During our trip we stopped at a Kasbah which we were guided around (for an extra 15 dirham, I think). It was actually a very interesting visit with panoramic views of the surrounding landscape and a beautiful little town to look and shop around. After our visit to the Kasbah we went to a restaurant and were able to have a swim in the pool - a very needed cool off. Later that day we visited the Dades Gorge where we stayed the night in a nice hotel that was very welcome after a long day's drive. We had tagine for dinner and were then seranaded by a group of drummers which was really fun! The next day we drove down to the Sahara and, after our drive, went for a swim in a hotel swimming pool before our trek into the desert. We got onto camels and trekked into the desert where we stayed in a very authentic camp (although thankfully it had beds!). Overall we had a fantastic experience and, as one of the cheapest tours offered around Marrakech, it was certainly worth the money we paid for it. Kamal was the perfect guide and although he drove us over 400 miles, remained 100% happy and helpful. He also navigated the bends of the Atlas mountains expertly! I would definitely recommend this tour company and would use them again if I were to return to Morocco. Thanks Kamal and Rachid from Rachel and Zanny"

They gave me the info and I rang Rachid who put us straight on the tour for the next day! We went on the 2night/3 day Marrakech to Merzouga trip that included an overnight stay in another Riad in the Dades gorge and an overnight stay in the desert. Everything about this trip was perfect. Our guide, Kamal was extremely helpful, happy and friendly. He also turned out to be a pretty good driver as he navigated his way around lorries on the mountain roads and kept us all safe in the car! We travelled in a 4x4 as there were only 6 of us on the trip which also meant that we could drive across a river and up to a few view points to get some good photos. The Riad was also good. The only thing I could say that was bad about it was that we had no hot water in our room but the staff were very friendly and we were serenaded after dinner by some Berber boys playing the drums. We then travelled towards the desert and got to have a swim in a pool before getting on our camels to ride into the desert at sunset. The Berber camp that we went to was great: friendly men and a fun camel ride with great pictures. We also had a good tagine and couscous dinner. We then travelled back to Marrakech the next day which was a long drive (10ish hours) but Kamal stopped enough times along the way to have breaks etc. I would recommend this tour to anyone and after doing some research into it, it looks like it's a pretty good price (120\u20ac) each. Kamal was a great guide and the company was very trustworthy. We had a great time and it really made our trip to morocco a bit more special."

            "review": "Marrakech & Merzouga Desert. This was our first visit to Morocco and Discover Morocco Tours made it such a memorable trip. We had only a few days and wanted to see as much as possible. Rachid put together an itinerary and made sure that every last detail was taken care of for us. MARRAKECH:We flew into Marrakech and Rachid was at the airport waiting with transportation to our riad (primary form of accommodation: equivalent to a b&b or guest house). We stayed in the heart of the medina (which was amazing) but vehicles can only take you so far. When we reached the gates Rachid had arranged for someone to meet us with a hand-pulled cart for our luggage. We were very grateful for this as it was still a good 10 minute walk through the narrow busy streets/alleyways of the medina to reach our riad. He gave us a little time to settle into our accommodation then arranged for an orientation city tour of Marrakech with a local guide who specialized in Marrakech walking tours. This was a good way to start the trip. We were able to see the different areas of the city, visit the palace, learn some history, see some of the local handcrafts in progress and shop in the market. If we hadn't taken this tour we would most likely not have ventured outside the medina on our own so it was great to see a little more of the city. Our time in Marrakech was amazing but the primary reason we chose Discover Morocco Tours was to see more of Morocco and visit the desert. Rachid met us at our riad early in the morning and off we went on our road trip! He had arranged a driver with a spacious van. We left Marrakech and began our adventure over the Atlas mountains into the desert.ROAD TRIP ACROSS MOROCCO:We chose the Merzouga desert trip because of the red sand. This was the Sahara we had always pictured. The Merzouga desert is almost twice the distance from Marrakech compared to the Zagora desert (the other option with white sand / smaller dunes). So the itinerary we were interested in is usually a long excursion. That said, we only had a few days in Morocco. Rachid was amazing and worked with us to put together an excursion that would allow us to visit Merzouga in our timeframe and budget. The downside would be a lot of traveling in a short time (hundreds of miles in a matter of days) but we were prepared to deal with that and Rachid did his best to break it up for us. Considering how far we had to go we still saw so much! It's incredible how different the mountains, villages and deserts are from the Morocco we experienced in Marrakech. The stops that Rachid chose gave an incredible taste of the country. It was a really good balance of known attractions and \"real Morocco\". At most of the stops Rachid accompanied us as the guide but for some sites he arranged a local guide to take us around. These local guides rely on tour companies to bring visitors to see their villages so we were happy to learn from the locals.DESERT CAMPING:It took two days to get to the red desert. Rachid arranged accommodation at a hotel just outside the Dades Gorges for us the first night (which was excellent). When we reached Merzouga the next day we established base at a desert hotel. The camels and desert camping excursions are all associated with hotels just outside the dunes so that there is a place for the drivers to stay while visitors are in the desert. This arrangement also permits visitors to lock up their belongings and allows use of the facilities (showers) when visitors return which we were very grateful for. Merzouga is actually the name of the town where these hotels that offer desert excursions are located. The dunes themselves are called Erg Chebbi. The desert was worth every second spent on the road to get there. We were met at the hotel by one of the Berbers from the camp. He had a camel for each of us and led us over the dunes into the Sahara. About an hour into the camel trek we stopped to watch the sunset. We were already deep enough into the desert that nothing but dunes could be seen whichever direction you looked and the sun hitting the red sand is like nothing I could ever describe. I can't imagine anything in our lifetime will compare to the half hour spent on top of that dune. Ever.When we were ready we continued our trek into the desert. It was another hour before we reached camp but when you are on a camel trek in the Sahara you take in every minute. The sky was so clear that the moon and the stars provided plenty of light. In fact when we reached camp we spent the first half hour laying in the dunes watching shooting stars.Dinner was delicious. Typical Moroccan tagine: bread, meat, potatoes and vegetables with fruit for dessert. After dinner a campfire was built. There were five other groups from all over staying at the camp so we all tried to introduce ourselves. Then the berber men joined the campfire and performed traditional berber music for about an hour. They got us up dancing and even passed their instruments around for everyone to try. It was fantastic.We did not know what to expect from the camping experience but it was very enjoyable. Sleeping tents were all together and faced inward to a communal area. We had our own tent complete with cots dressed in blankets and pillows. Dinner was served in a large tent at the front of camp decorated in beautiful moroccan textiles with tables and chairs. And there were outhouse-style toilets just outside the tents. It definitely exceeded our expectations.On the morning we left our camels were waiting for us outside of camp. I will admit that this second camel ride was felt far more than our first. Despite the padding from the blankets on the harness, riding camels will leave it's mark on your inner thighs. But despite a little discomfort the views of the Sahara were no less spectacular on the way out.Because of our limited timeframe we had to head directly back to Marrakech from Merzouga. It was a long drive (12+hrs) but the views along the way were incredible. When we arrived Rachid walked with us to our riad, making sure we found it in the dark. The following morning he met us for breakfast where we marked our travels on a map bought in the market and he arranged transport back to the airport in time for our flight. Rachid walked with us all the way to the check-in desk. By this time we were saying goodbye to a friend, not just our guide. You will not get an experience like this with any old tour company.If we are fortunate enough to return to Morocco in the near future we wouldn't think twice before booking with Discover Morocco Tours again. We had such a fantastic experience. Thank you Rachid!!!"

I can quite easily say it was the best part of our time in Morocco. We were picked up by Kamal who was our host for the two days. Kamal was a fantastic tour guide. He was easy going, had a great sense of humour and always made sure we were comfortable. We stopped at a number of different places to explore and take photos. He was very knowledgeable and was happy to answer any questions we had. I would highly recommend Kamal to anyone thinking about doing a tour with Discover Morocco Tours. If you have 4-5 days in Marrakesh, this tour is perfect. We were joined by another couple from Britain which we got on with very well. The landscape on the way to Zagoura is truly breathtaking and the people were friendly wherever we went. We eventually reached Zagoura and were picked by the Berbers who provided the camel ride and night in the desert. We stayed in the Berber camp and had a great time. The dinner, atmosphere and morning sunsets were all fantastic. The next day Kamal picked us up and we commenced the journey back to Marrakesh.Many thanks to Kamal and the team. You guys provided a memorable experience.Shane and NicolaSydney, Australia"

First we went to a traditional Berber house - had a lovely breakfast and saw how to make mint tea. Then we stopped for a camel ride which was good fun. We then stopped off to see how Argan oil is made which was very interesting and a chance to purchase some products. We then hiked for an hour and a half in Ourkia valley to a wonderful waterfall (this was tough work in the heat but well worth it!). The day finished with a great lunch by the river. Our driver and tour guide were very kind and helpful - they also played some great music on the drive between stops! We very much enjoyed the day and highly recommend this tour company."

Because of this, we were able to have some truly authentic experiences...Our riads were amazing, the meals delicious, and the life fascinating. We began in the Atlas Mountains and the Oasis... parts of Morocco that I had no idea existed. The natural side of Moroccco along with the Berber culture was an experience to behold.We also had the privilege of staying in a desert camp in the Sahara!The people everywhere were so kind and hospitable.We also saw Fez and Marrakech and by the end of the tour had become great friends with both Abdul and Rachid.Thank you both for everything!!!! :)~ The Americans ~"

I went to Marrakech with 2 friends, at first we weren't sure if we wanted to visit the desert, partly because the drive was so long and many of the tours were really expensive. Luckily my friend found out about Discover Morocco Tours. We booked through email and Rachid was really patient and informative to respond to all our questions. They even arranged a driver to pick us up at the airport. The 2 day trip to Zagoura Desert was definitely the best part of our trip. We stop every hour or so to take pictures of the gorgeous scenery and to stretch our legs. We even visited the Berber villages where many movies were shot. This made the 8 hr drive pass by in a blink. When we arrived at the desert we rode camels to the camp which was another exciting experience. We were expecting to have to sleep in sleeping bags in the tent, but the camp was a lot better than what we were expecting with electricity and actual beds! Looking at the stars in the middle of the desert was another unforgettable experience. We woke up early to see the sunrise in the desert the next morning and they served nice coffee, mint tea and bread for breakfast. The drive back to Marrakech was comfortable with the friendly driver and Rachid who is very genuine, helpful and made us feel very welcomed. I would definitely recommend Discover Morocco tours and hope to go back and see more of Morocco!"

The Trip started with Rachid (our host) and Abdul (our driver) coming to our Riad (Matham) to pick us up, so we wouldn't get lost trying to find them. The kindness didn't stop there, throughout the two days with Rachid and Abdul both went out of their way to make our trip great even when they didn't have to. From little gestures such as buying us Moroccan sweets we had never tried before, to bigger such as secretly getting a birthday cake for my dads birthday with his name written on it - and getting the whole camp to sing happy birthday. He was touched by Rachid's kindness and I was grateful for the gesture. As for the trip itself, we made lots of stops at interesting places which I won't go into, but as a photographer, they were all awesome.We took a camel ride (my first experience of this) through the Zogora desert at sunset which was beautiful, then stayed over night in a tent which was a massive surprise - It wasn't cold, wasn't cover in desert bugs, and was actually quite comfortable. Food was also provided at night and in the morning. Was a lot of fun!I recommend this to anyone, even people who aren't so 'outdoorsy'. Thanks Rachid for a great trip."

I have just returned from a week long trip to Marrakech for my honeymoon with my wife and chose discover Morocco tours after wading through various options on trip advisor. I wasn't disappointed. I was in contact with Rachid before the honeymoon and he was extremely helpful and patient in asking my numerous questions (I wanted to get it right!) and so that filled me with confidence before getting out there. We chose the 2 day trips to the Ozud waterfalls and the 3 valleys and they were really worth it, we both thoroughly enjoyed the trips and gave us a good flavour of Morocco life. What particularly struck us about Rachid and our driver Abdul was how professional and knowledgeable they were but also so down to earth, friendly and good fun they were too, and they seemed to get the balance perfectly. We liked how they were leaving us to chat and be by ourselves for a lot of the time too - they weren't in our faces all the time, like I guess some tour guides might be, and we appreciated that. Rachid was flexible too when we decided to change one of our trips and we thought this might be a problem but he was fine with it. What was also good was how it really felt like we were incontrol and he accommodated us so well - from giving us a chance to stop and take pics etc whenever we wanted to picking us up bang on time at our Riad and giving us lots of helpful info about life in Marrakech. 2 things that also impressed me about this compared with other options were that Rachid picked us up and took us back to the airport as part of the package, and the money for the day trips was for everything - lunch and drinks included, so we didn't have to worry about anything.All in all a brilliant time with Rachid and Abdul who felt more like friends than guides by the end of the week. We are keen to return one day."

Firstly I booked our over night stay in the desert a few months ago and Rachid was prompt to respond and very informative. We were picked up from the airport by Amanar on time and I explained that we needed to change our money as I did not want to do it at the airport, he took us straight to a bureau in the town which was a great help. We then met Rachid and he showed us to our Riad I had booked. Rachid provided us with a map and his telephone number and some really good tips for our stay. The following morning Amanar took us on our overnight trip to the desert and we had a great time, he went above and beyond, he has a great sense of humour and was very knowledgeable. On the 2nd day he found us a donkey to have pictures with as I had mentioned it the day before. We stopped at many stalls/shops on the way through the mountains and he was patient whilst us girls shopped! Finally both Amanar and Rachid met us on our last day to get us back to the airport. I know I have waffled on but these guys are brilliant, I cannot fault them in any way and I highly recommend them. We had a great time and have returned home with some lovely memories."

Rachid answered very promptly and was more than willing to tailor the trip to our needs. I booked two trips (12th/13th Feb 2014). One was a day tour around Marrakech and the main attractions and souks. This was by a local guide and not Rachid. This really gave me and my husband a real life in sight into the medina. This was a trip by foot and we saw many famous sights and also went deep into hidden souks. On the second day we had arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains/three valleys. The day started at 7.50am. We were with Rachid and his friend Abdul. We travelled first to have camel ride. We then went to eat breakfast in a Berber house where we were really looked after and had fresh home made traditional food. We then stopped at various places on our journey to see beautiful picturesque views. The next stop was a mountain bike ride. Me and my husband have never laughed so much. We are slim but unfit and in our late 20's and attempting to do a mountain bike ride! Although physically difficult for us (we also wore jeans and it was really hot!) the views and experience was incredible. After this we needed some much needed lunch! Rachid and Abdul treated us to some traditional street food which was gorgeous - think of a spiced barbecued burger. The day did not end here. We then went on to finish the day quad biking! This was fantastic. The views were stunning and Rachid really knew the best spots! We were back to our hotel by 5.15pm despite such a busy day.Throughout the day Rachid and Abdul were always joking with us and answered any questions. We spoke about the Moroccan culture, politics and religion. No question was left unanswered. They were open minded and like they both said they treat you like family! Would definitely recommend Rachid and his company. I will never forget these memories!"

Rachid out-sourced this, and we got the impression he is trying to find the right guides for this particular tour to meet his high standards. Our guide was ok - not bad, but certainly not great... The tour finishes early afternoon. The second tour was the Ait benhaddou/Ouarzazate/Atlas mountain trip. A long day from 8am to 9pm, but what a day. Rachid and his outstanding driver took us not only to the highlights of this special tour, but also took time to do some extras (taking a more scenic route there, doing a great 4x4 \"race\" across the desert towards Ouarzazate, etc.). I would HIGHLY recommend this day out with Rachid. The 3rd tour was the Ourika Valley trip, which was pretty good, particularly the last climb from the first waterfall up. Overall we really like Rachid. He is clearly proud of his tradition and country, and we got a small taste of this beautiful place with his warm hospitality and engaging character! I regret not doing a 2 day trip into the desert with him - other reviews seem to be raving about that too!"

It was such a nice tour with a great guide !We started the tour early in the morning by a good breakfast and our guide explain us the program for this days. During all the excursion we could admire beautiful landscape and discover the berbere culture. Rachid was an amazing guide, very helpful and who make us feel like his best friends. The night in Merzouga desert will stay our best moment and i will never forget the berbere music around the fire. Most of all, Rachid was perfect, very funny and very proud of his culture, he showed us all of his country and we learned a lot about his culture.Thank of you Rachid, and i wish to come back in morocco to see the rest of the country with you !"

Rachid could not do enough to make our journey pleasant.Rachid helped us understand Morocco with his continual conversation and willingness to answer every question posed about morocco, including politics, social life, traditions and the country's culture.

Though Rachid was not able to make it the first 2 days of the trip, he legt us in the good hands of his best friend Hassan. The trip was amazing, we went through Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah, Ouarzazate, Todgha to the Todra Gorge, Tinjdad and finally to Merzouga. The landscape changed every 20 minuten, and so did the colors. The hotel was good, and the nomad camp was even better. Great camel ride watching the sunset and sunrise, lovely food, nice berber music and the sky full of stars was amazing! The last day Rachid joined us and guided us back to Marrakech. He was great company, and offered to help us at any time, apart from the desert trip. We really felt comfortable with this tour agency and its guides, they really love their work and know a lot about the Morrocan culture and sites. We would definitely book this tour or another tour at this agency again!"

I had seen some very good reviews of Rachid on the internet and I was not disappointed to have booked with him!! He took my girlfriend and me on an excursion to Ait Benhaddou and made it the experience of a lifetime!Rachid is very knowledgeable, friendly and funny! From the start of the day until we returned to Marrakech, he made it a fun, exciting and interesting day. He gave us lots of information about the Berber culture, Moroccan history and the sights we were seeing; he answered all of our questions and was an endless source of knowledge.We stopped at many places on our journey through the Atlas mountains: for a Berber breakfast (which was included in the price of the tour), to see some amazing and interesting settlements and views, at a place where they made argan oil (a lady there gave us a short tour and explained how they produced the various oils used for cosmetics and eating), to stop for coffee breaks, and at a number of Berber stalls selling souvenirs and the likes.The driver was very safe and experienced but managed to take make the journey quick and pleasant. His car was very comfortable with air conditioning; Rachid chatted with us throughout the journey and even played Berber music for us on the car stereo!When we reached Ait Benhaddou we stopped for a delicious lunch (also included) and enjoyed views of the Kasbah before proceeding to see it up close. Rachid showed me how to tie a Berber style turban (I think it is called a Shesh or Chan) which helped protect me from the bright sun. He let us take our time and stop to look at things that we took interest in, he never rushed us.I cannot explain what a great man Rachid is, he is very down to earth and has an amazing outlook on life! He told us of some of his life experiences, some of which are very moving. He is a Berber himself and knew most of the people we met along our journey. He explained that some guides are in cahoots with the traders and will take tourists to places that overcharge you and give commission back to the guide. He doesn't take any commission from any of the traders and even told us which places were overcharging customers and not to buy anything from them.If you get a chance to take an excursion with Rachid then you simply must do it! You will not regret it!! If I am able to go back in Marrakech again then I will definitely go on an excursion to the dessert with Rachid as I would love to spend a night or two trekking through the dunes and seeing the stars!Thank you Rachid, this was the highlight of our holiday!"

We booked this trip with complete ease - we contacted Rachid the evening before the trip and had a reply within hours confirming that we would be able to travel the next day, which we didnt expect. We initially chose Rachid due to the great price that was offered, and we weren't disappointed. We were picked up from our Riad on time by our friendly, English-speaking guide and taken to Rachid's comfortable mini-van with seatbelts and air conditioning. We then proceeded to drive out of Marrakech with our guide explaining a few things about the Berbers and Morocco. He was polite and friendly and Rachid drives very well and is very careful. The hour and a half journey is split well, meaning we weren't in the minivan for the full time before we were seeing our attractions.Our first stop consisted of visiting a traditional Berber family home, where we were provided with a tour as well as a delicious breakfast made by the family themselves. Although there were other tourists there, it did not seem overcrowded or make much of a difference. The people and the sights from the house were wonderful.Following our stop here, we continued ahead to our camel ride, which was a little shorter than stated on the website, but not by much. We were still pleased with the amount of riding we got to do, with beautiful views either side. We also stopped at a small place where Argan Oil is produced and sold, with an English speaking lady who provided all the information we needed.Our final stop was in the Ourika Valley itself, where we walked to the waterfalls. It was quite a journey, which took around 50 minutes each way but the sights were excellent and we felt well looked after by our guide who was friendly and chatty throughout. We seemed to pass the touristy waterfall and headed to another one which was more secluded and private, which was great. After we had walked back down we were provided with a delicious free three course lunch, where we only had to pay for our own drinks and a tip.This concluded our trip and we were escorted back to our Riad by Rachid and our guide. The drive back was pleasant and a well deserved sit down!"

He knows and lived a vast amount of the Berber country and endeavours to inform you with all he knows. You will soon learn just how much Rachid feels for and dedicates to the people of his part of the world. Most of all it's fair to say, you will also learn Rachid is really not interested in making commissions or great profits as he'll purposely steer you away from dodgy sellers and overpriced restaurants - don't just take my word for it, use your own judgement here.The tour itself covered great distance and many cultures that you travelled to Morocco to see. This was easily the highlight of the trip and you won't want to go back to the bigger cities after you've travelled outside of these limited traveller vacuums! - Thanks again Rachid!"

Had the chance to visit a Berber family and was treated to traditional breakfast (all the meals included in the price!) and got to see how Moroccan mint tea is prepared and served. Got to ride camels too and visited an institute where Moroccan oil and other natural remedies are being made. The height of the day was however the hike up the mountains to see the waterfalls. It was cool in the mountains and the scenery was extremely beautiful. It wasn't an entirely easy hike but our guide made sure that everyone safely made it up to the waterfalls. Really recommend this day trip! A memorable experience and a great way to either have fun with friends or make new ones!"

We did a 3d/2n private tour (guide, driver and us) from Marrakech to Todra Gorges (we slept in a nice hotel with a spectacular view) and then to Merzouga where after an 1,5h camel ride, we spent a night on the desert. On the last day we travelled all the way up to Fes, stopping in the most interesting and beautiful places. Rachid was an awesome guide who provided us with a lot of insights into Morocco, its people and culture. During the tour he was also taking care of all the details to make sure we felt safe, enjoyed every moment and got the best out of it. We travelled in a brand new SUV with a great and responsible driver. We truly recommend this tour to anyone who wants to see a bit of the country and better understand it."

It was hands-down our best decision during our entire stay in Marrakesh. During our trip we visited the Merzouga Desert and had an amazing sunset camel ride through the red sands and giant dunes. We got to stay with a berber camp and look at the stars, which are simply stunning in the Sahara Desert. Our trip was lead by the owner of the company Rachid, and he was an amazing guide. In my previous trip to Morocco (a couple of years back) my guide simply pointed out landscapes without much explanation but during this trip we were very lucky to have Rachid, who is very knowledgeable and made an effort to tell us about the history and culture of the places we were visiting. Rachid made everything in our trip run smoothly and he even made a point to help us with other logistics of our trip after the excursion was over. Rachid and Discover Morocco helped make our trip a wonderful and memorable experience and I recommend Discover Morocco to anyone planning a trip to Marrakesh. I also recommend taking time to visit the Merzouga Desert which is the desert you see in photographs of the Sahara (orange sand, large sand dunes). During my previous trip I visited the Zagoura Desert which was still a great trip though not quite as gorgeous and memorable as the Merzouga. Thanks so much Rachid for an amazing trip and experience!! -Ana from California"

We found Rachid to be warm, friendly, easy to talk too and very responsive to our emails and questions; plus he and his assistants were punctual (which clients always appreciate). He was flexible enough to work with us so as to deviate a bit from the norm and include a trip to an authentic Berber market - which we found facinating. Unfortuanlty, Rachid could not be with us all day but his partner was just a professional and knowlegable. All-in-all a great day. We would definately recommend his service and if we go back, use him again. Thanks Rachid,"

I did the 3 day, 2 night excursion to the Merzouga Desert (has beautiful red sand, large dunes) and it's for sure one of the best trips I've ever been on. There was suppose to be another group joining the tour but they cancelled last minute and instead of cancelling the tour altogether, our guide Rachid still did it (for the same price) but with just me and my two friends. He always went out of his way to accommodate our needs and made sure we were always comfortable throughout our trip. Rachid, along with the driver who were both very considerate and always had our best interest at heart, made us feel more like family than just another regular tour group. Rachid was very knowledgeable in Berber culture and Morocco's history, and we were able to see everything from the Kasbah to the gorges and the Atlas Mountains. The camel ride to the Merzouga desert was incredible, you start right before sunset (and get to stop while the sun's setting to take some epic photos) and the return ride is right before sunrise. We had a hilarious nomad guide that led our camels to the campsite and when we arrived we were served a nice traditional dinner along with live music and dancing. On the way back we were able to shower and change at a hotel so the overall trip is well thought out and very accommodating. Rachid is hands down the best guide you could ask for, so I strongly recommend this tour (he is the owner) as well as doing the 3 day, 2 night excursion to get to the Merzouga Desert (it's worth the extra day!!) This is definitely going down as one of my most memorable experiences. Thanks Rachid!! -Natasha, USA"

Firstly we would like to thank Rachid and his colleague, a very responsible and smart driver, for everything they did on the trip.Before coming to Marrakech, we contacted like 20 different travel agencies with the same quote: 3 days, 2 nights in Merzouga (Erg Chebbi sand dunes). Rachid (Discover Morocco Tours) gave us an offer we couldn't resist: the price was really good, the tour was private (for 4 people), we didn't have to worry about anything apart from memorizing all that interesting information our guide was giving us. I have to point out the fact that everything was included in the price (a night in a hotel, three meals per day, a camel ride, night in a tent in nomad's camp). Because most agencies only include one or two meals. You can get a better price from other tour agencies if you join a shared tour with many people. But in this case you will not get a guide (only a driver) and no freedom at all. And we could freely ask to stop and have a short break in some scenic areas on the way to the desert, we could ask about anything and Rachid would answer as he's very knowledgeable and attentive.Thank you and hope to meet you again!Lithuanians:)"

Instead he uses his network to get you the best price. All the restaurants or cafes were good quality and Rachid will pay for it for you which makes things a lot easier. He is quick to buy you drinks even if you don't really want one! But it is all included. The best value though is Rachids time. Despite paying group price, Rachid was our private guide, we only piggybacked another vehicle to keep costs down."

While there, we stayed with Rachid - he was fantastic, he helped us throughout the whole time we were there, took us to incredible off the guide book placed, and was just a good friend throughout! Rachid's day trips are also fantastic, my friends and I went on a tour to the waterfalls and the country with rachid and it was incredible. Still to this day one of the more beautiful and serene places I've ever gone! Thanks for everything - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

Richard organised a fantastic trip for me into the mountains to see the waterfalls and gain a greater appreciation for the more tradtional aspects of Moroccon live, away from the sometimes exhausting nature of Marrakech. The group nature of the trip was great for meeting fellow travellers and the driver and group leaders were friendly, helpfull and knowledgeable! It was a throughly enjoyable day trip and would reconmend it to anyone, thankyou for all your help Rachid!!!"

Right away, Rachid calmed our worries about the hectic and unfamiliar city, and sat down with us to show us on a map where we were and how to get to key attractions such as Djemaa el Fna and the souks. He even lent us his cell phone so that we could call for help if we got lost! That really impressed us, since he showed such great trust and hospitality before even getting to know us. Later on in the trip, my fiance got kind of sick (probably from some bad food at the food stalls). My fiance didn't feel up to trying to find food ourselves while he was sick, and we didn't have a lot of money, so we talked to Rachid and Rachid took us to a reliable, clean little local restaurant (not catering to tourists). Rachid helped us order and buy some roast chicken with bread and veggies. Nothing fancy, but very solid and we knew we could trust its cleanliness and quality because of Rachid. Overall, Rachid is extremely friendly, personable, considerate, knowledgeable, and helpful for anything you might need. He speaks good English, and you will not regret taking a tour with him. You will feel like you've made a great friend in Morocco--one you'll want to hang on to. I highly recommend his services."

After walking, lost, around Marrakech trying to find our riad, I thought the trip was going to be a little hectic. Then, I met Rachid!!! For the rest of the time I had no time getting around the city and the surrounding area. Rachid knows so many people and places and has such a loving family, that you will feel like you belong in Morocco! Traveling around Morocco can be a bit daunting, but Rachid, with such a kind heart and open arms, can make anyone's trip wonderful. It helps to have his knowledge of the Atlas mountains, Marrakech and Morocco to feel like you've really seen Morocco, really gotten a feeling for its people and culture. I recommend taking a tour with him if you visiting Morocco. It will be the highlight of your trip.\u0634\u0643\u0631 Rachid"

Rishard set up and took me and 2 friends on this awesome trip to check out waterfalls and some of the beautiful wilderness in the interior of morocco. We had a private car pick us up at the hotel and drive us a couple hours. Just the car ride alone was great since Rishard is the man and made the trip feel like 2 minutes. Hes the nicest guy. After we did some hiking and saw the waterfalls, we had a beautiful authentic moroccan tajin lunch with monkeys running around the all-outdoors restaurant and the waterfalls as our view. This could have been the highlight of the trip since we were all just chilling enjoying the food, friends, and scenery. Life doesnt get better. Anyways, we did some more hiking and sight seeing and loved it all. We also took a 30 minute rafting adventure down one of the rivers which was chill. Overall, i'd recommend doing this trip again, but make sure you do it with Rishard. He made the trip go smoothly & memorably."

He helped find a great guide at Ourika valley falls and stopped whenever we wanted to take photos or look at a Berber house. He even helped get a good deal on a roadside camel ride which the boys begged to do regardless of how touristy it was. The SUV / minivan was air conditioned and very comfortable.

I rushed back out to see if I could find Jamal and luckily Jamal had noticed the bag left in the car and returned back to where he dropped us. He was very prompt with answering to emails even late in the evening and I would highly recommend using his service."

Having been let down by another transfer company based in the UK, last minute, I turned to Trip Advisor and Easy Take transport services seemed like the best choice. I was quite apprehensive as they were based in Morocco but email conversations soon put me at ease. Samir was our driver on both our journey to and fro the airport. He was very professional and polite and always there waiting for us ahead of time. Thank you all for a pleasant service."

The drivers were courteous and did go out of their way to tell us all the popular spots and history of both Marrakech and indeed the whole of Morocco. They were polite and always arrived before time, and were very flexible when we needed to change the time or location whenever necessary. Fantastic service with good drivers and excellent customer service, would recommend to everyone and will definitely use again next year!!!"

Travelling from Australia, we weren't sure what to expect however after lengthy delays getting through Casablanca airport, we were relieved to see our driver Hamza waiting at arrivals for us after a 1.5 hour delay!!! We also booked a day trip to Essaouria and Hamza went above and beyond for us! Thank you! Definitely would use this upon return to Marrakech and highly recommend for other travellers. A++++."

Some days later the same driver took us back to Marrakech and he also took us on a day trip to the Ourika Valley. We got excellent service, our driver was always on time, he was cautious, and was a good guide that was inspiring to talk to. He spoke both english and french. The prices we paid were reasonable.

After that, it was nothing but an easy and pleasant experience. I had decided to get picked up in Casablanca instead of taking the connecting flight. The driver, Hakim was waiting for me with a sign that was clearly visible. Taking the 2 1/2 hour drive was a way better move than sitting in the airport. The drive to Marrakech was wonderful as i got to see more of the country,  I used Easy Take Transport everyday of my trip. I had the most friendly and knowledgeable driver. His name was Samir and I highly recommend you request him. He was with me from 9am -2am. Always made sure I was taken care of everywhere we went. He knew all the great spots to see and the ones that were too touristy and not worth it. I never felt unsafe or concerned about anything while traveling with East Take. The owner emailed or called through out my trip to make sure i was ok and if I needed anything. They really know wheat they are doing and I wouldn't travel any other way in Morocco.  I look forward to returning and using the service again. Thank you Samir, Hakim and Jamal. You guys rock!!! Spencer"

They were very responsive via email and were waiting for us with a sign as we came out of customs. The driver was courteous and friendly and the van was spacious, clean and looked new. Riads are all in the medina and so you can't take a vehicle in later in the day. The driver had arranged for a man with a cart to take our luggage to the Riad. That was quite an experience as the area was full of people, donkey carts and motorcycles. The man with the cart got us right to the door through the crowds, twists and turns safe and sound (tip him well). For our return to the airport, I emailed Easy Take the day before and made arrangements for an early morning pick up. In this case because there are very few people on the narrow streets, they can come right to the Riad. They arrived on time and were responsive to some last minute changes. I highly recommend Easy Take."

Only thing to remember is to make a request by e-mail day before. We were also on private trip with driver Hakim to Essaouira and Ourika. I really don't know if they make us some special price (maybe off season?) but we traveled on our own van for same price other companies ask for 4 places in 16-passenger buses. Hakim is very kind guy and if You need someone speaking also Italian he will be your choice. Thanks a lot Hakim!"

We researched things to do and see, and decided on a day trip. It was difficult to choose a tour company as so many reviews were excellent on trip adviser, but having contacted a few I was very pleased to receive an immediate reply from Easy Take Transport who offered a choice of day trips. Reading that a couple of the trips were quite a distance, over 3 hours driving in each direction we opted for a shorter visit to the Ourika Valley. Our driver/guide arrived at our hotel a little before the arranged time. The car was large, clean and comfortable and while our driver didn't speak brilliant english we enjoyed the challenge of using our little French and managed to communicate well. His enthusiasm and pride in his country of his country were infectious. Breakfast at a Berber house was the highlight of our holiday. Sharing freshly cooked bread with such wonderful, welcoming people was a joy.Our local guide, (Omar) up to the waterfall was knowledgeable about the area both historically and geographically. Clambering over the rocks up the mountain is not for the faint hearted but well worth the effort and Omar ensured our safety through out.Overall a brilliant day out. thank you to all"

Maybe we should have more prior research before taking the trip but the way it was billed was as though it's a tour guide/driver to the location.As a driver this trip was 100% but as a tour this was a poor choice of company.

Jamal picked us up at the ryad right in time with a comfortable car, then we went off to Zagora (desert) with several stops for interesting sites & views.It was never a problem for Jamal to make a stop for a drink or a toilet break.We arrived in Zagora in the evening, took the camel to go to our tents in the desert. It was a magical evening. The next day, Jamal picked us up again and dropped us next to our ryad in Marrakech. The last day of our trip, my friends and I spent the day at Rhoul Palace, which was quite far from our ryad so we had to take our luggage (three women, no further explanation needed). So Jamal suggested he would pick us up at the Palace and drop us at the airport. That was really helpful to avoid the stress to be at the airport in time etc. Since we were hungry, he stopped at a great pastry shop. At the airport, he helped us with our luggage and accompanied us to the check-in.Conclusion: we never felt unsafe, Jamal provided an excellent service (always in time) and could answer all our questions. Also strongly recommended for women travelling alone.Thanks Jamal for this great experience!"

The driver/guide (Khalid) showed up promptly (early in fact) ready for our days tour just before 09:00.The car was parked around the corner, as it would have been impossible to get to our Riad down the narrow streets, but he came to the Riad to meet us, and walked us back to the car. We were the only two people on the trip, and the car was a very new Korean 4x4 style vehicle, and very comfortable.Khalid made it clear at the start of the day that the trip was our day, and he would stop where he knew the good places were to stop, but if we wanted to stop for any reason we just needed to request and he would stop for us. We saw many other tours whilst in the mountains, but these seemed more organized - and not in a good way! - there did not seem to be the flexibility on stopping where they wanted.The mountains are beautiful, and the scenery very pretty and we got some great photo opportunities. We headed down the Ourika valley - note this was December, and was supposed to be a quiet time. You could tell from the number of restaurants there, and how empty they were that this was the quiet time. In the height of season when people are escaping the heat of Marrakech for the coolness of the mountains - I can imagine it is bedlam in the mountains. We did the walk with a walking guide up the waterfalls. It was approx an hour to the halfway point, and our guide was not keen to take us for the further hour - and i'll be honest we were not that keen to go any further anyway - so we walked back to have our lunch. (Our choice - we could have eaten first if we had wished, but the walk was quite strenuous so am glad we did this way around).The lunch itself was very good, the food was superb. I was not sure if the cost of food and drink was included in the trip or not (as I could not remember) - but it was not. The restaurant was not expensive either, but it was obviously part of the tour, as it was the busiest restaurant in the area.On the way back we stopped at this herbal place. It did nothing for me, but my wife enjoyed it, and again the guy that showed us around was very knowledgeable.Khalid's English was very good, but we did between us (with my non-existent French/Arabic or Berber language!) sometimes have moments of conversation that were lost in translation. This unfortunately included when it came to making the payment at the end of the day. No cross words - and I do not believe it was intentional - we were all tired, but it meant heading back to the Riad at the end of the day to confirm the price with the guy from Riad that had booked it, and when we wrote it down on a piece of paper we were all in agreement on the price.I would recommend to the owner to perhaps supply some water to the customers in the back of the car gratis as we only took a small bottle, and we did not stop again until before lunch to get more refreshments. To be fair we did not ask to stop - but gratis water in the car would have been a nice touch.This did not detract from the day though - was definitely our favourite day in Marrakesh, and I would recommend this company to all."

Jamal the owner was very responsive and answered all our questions. The driver was on time, personable, and made for a great day trip. We hired several drivers in our 12 day trip to Morocco and Easy Take and the driver we received were by far the most professional operator we encountered. Would recommend to anyone and look forward to hiring them again in the future."

His English is good and service reliable. I have used Jamal's services many times now, from trips in a 4x4 through to Airport Collections when we needed a Minibus for a larger groups. As a regular visitor to Marrakech, I have used many different vehicle services in the past but none have met expectation as well as Jamal and his new fleet of vehicles."

Khaled the driver was on time and collected us from our Riad. The drive was very comfortable in his new 4x4. Khaled was very knowledgeable about Marrakesh as well as the valleys and villages and gave us an interesting insight of Marrakesh. He stopped wherever we wanted to take pictures and had organised his own stops at a Berber family house where we drank nice Moroccan tea and tried pure honey and home-made butter. Other stops were at places with nice panoramic views and an argon oil cooperative where we bought pure argon oil and honey. And of course we stopped for a nice lunch at one of the restaurants in ourika valley where we also linked up with Khaled's guide for the waterfall which was an amazing trek all the way up to the waterfall which took us 1 hour in total (Tip: wear good trainers/trekking shoes). Overall Khalid was a very cool, trustworthy and friendly guy who made the trip very enjoyable for us, he took many pictures for us!!! We totally recommend him especially if you are here as a couple/family and want to organize a private trip. The price was very reasonable, you are getting what you pay for, so you can't go wrong!!!"

I had initially requested Jamal\u2019s services for an excursion to Ourika Valley, which was fantastic. Jamal picked me up from my Riad in Marrakech right on time and drove me to the Atlas Mountains in his nice SUV. He showed me all the sights, including a visit to a Berber family home. Once we reached the mountains, he even hooked me up with a guide leading a group hike to the waterfalls, which was really enjoyable and cost effective. Having had such a great time, I availed of Jamal\u2019s services the next day too, which was my last day in Marrakech. I left my bags in his car and he showed me all around Marrakech, including the Bahia Palace, Saadian Tombs, Koutobia, Hammam etc. and dropped me off to the airport later. I had forgotten one of my packages in his car and he even arranged for it to be delivered to me at the airport, which speaks to his honesty and customer service. All I can say is that my trip to Morocco wouldn\u2019t have been half as enjoyable had it not been for Jamal. So thank you Jamal, and I hope you can be available whenever I am next in Morocco."

I found Jamal to be a great choice and would recommend him to everyone.I looked up a few on TA and came across EasyTake tours - I emailed Jamal and he was very responsive and gave me a very good price for our first excursion, which was a trip to Casablanca to visit the Hassan II mosque. Jamal arrived early to pick us up in his mini-van which was perfect for us, very clean and with plenty of space. We are a family of six which meant having to tumble the seats in his vehicle whenever we got in or out, which Jamal was immdeiately on hand to do.He was very polite and attentive to our needs and even suggested a few extra things to do, like having our picture taken outisde the famaous Ricks Cafe and also advising on a great place to eat along the corniche.I was so impressed with the service and value that I decied to use him for the remaining excursions, the second trip being a tour to the Atlas mountains. Again Jamal arrived ahead of time with his car cleaned from the previous day, he arranged the whole day for us with his various great contacts. We headed out early and stopped at a berber village where we met with a berber family who Jamal knew very well. We had a tour of their house and were then served a fantastic breakfast, with the best mint tea we'd ever had. We were served fresh bread, honey, olive oil and nuts - all of which were local produce and tasted fantastic. We were then taken to the next stop which was a berber village at the base of the Atlas mountains, here we met another friend of Jamal - whose name was also Jamal. He was a young berber guide who took us through the Ourika valley to the first waterfall and then upwards again and finally back to his village. The younger Jamal was also very good and really took care of us through our climb which was challenging in places.We used Jamal a third time to arrange a couple of activities around Marrakech - the girls wanted a spa treatment and the boys wanted to go quad biking. Again Jamal looked after us arranging everything without fuss and at a very reasonable price.Our final excursion was to Essouria, again Jamal arrived well ahead of time and we headed out to Essouria. We stopped along the way at a cafe and also at an Argan oil co-operative, where we had a tour of a small factory producing argan oil products. We then went to Essouria, where we stayed the whole day with Jamal waiting for us.On our last day in Marrakech Jamal also arranged one of his drivers to provide a taxi service for us around a couple of places in Marrakech, since he was busy with another tour. However, he did finally pick us up from our hotel to take us to the airport for our return flight in the evening.Overall, I was very impressed with Jamal, great manners, much more than just a transport service and never did I feel that I was under any pressure to buy additional services - as was often the case with other situations in Marrakesh. Great value for money, reliable, genuine and honest."

The country is beautiful, with stunning colours and completely different to everything I know! What made it extra special was Marrakech Tours Trips - Moha and Sayd. They will add to your adventure should you choose to travel with them. They have an infectious sense of fun and devilment that you can't ignore. Their attention to detail is second to none. On our return from the dessert we had to get a jeep from the base where the camels stayed to the main road to catch the bus to Marrakech. Enjoying the experience of 4 wheel driving through the dunes my phone fell out of my pocket without me realising. A half hour on the road it dawned on me. One quick phone call from Moha to Sayd had the whole thing sorted. My phone was on the next tour to Marrakech and was handed to me at a location that was most convenient for me and my boyfriend. Not stopping the amazing service there, my boyfriend and I had bought a 5 day / 4 night package and an extra 2 days, outside of the package, to visit Essouirra, another town by the beach. Sayd gave us amazing tips and tricks on how to get there, things to do, place to see etc. On the day we were flying home to Dublin, Sayd organised a private driver to take us from Marrakech to the airport. When we got in the car Sayd called to make sure we were well looked after and had enough time to get to the airport for our flight...I'm sure the other packages out there are great but from my boyfriend's and my experience we can't recommend Marrakech Tours Trips highly enough. 5 Star service from 5 Star people. Much love, best wishes and success to Marrakech Tours Trips for the future xxx"

We definitely made the right choice! Our day at the waterfalls was incredible only to be equalled by our trip to the coast. Then came the 2 day Sahara experience and BOOM what an EPIC adventure. Our driver, Husain, might be one of my favourite people in the world, the most awesome/entertaining driver I've ever met. Despite only being able to communicate in our shared broken italian we spent 8 hours bonding!  The desert experience itself was incredible, nothing too taxing and although it felt a bit organised at time that wasn't a problem. The guides were incredible, the main man Mohammed and Sayd were great fun and once you speak to them on the level they'll show you a great time!

The contrast from nature (Atlas and Sahara) to the city (Marrakech), was a good experience and made me speechless many times. Our guide Sayd could tell us a lot about Morocco and about the culture & custom of the people.The food was delicious and just in case you want know, there are normal toilets even in the sahara! :-)I don't know if it was just luck or if this was on purpose, but we all were almost of the same age and had a lot of fun while driving but also good conversations. Thank you Sayd for these unforgettable impressions and moments! so let's go, yallah yallah..."

I really recommend him as a guide through his excursions :) I enjoyed going on a camel ride just outside of the city but if we had more time we would have tried many of the other excursions he offers.

Everyone will try sell you something in Marrakech but the tour Sayd does is truly amazing and authentic and he won't just take you here and there like every one tour guide is Morocco but will actually stay with you and have a good time with you all as well and be apart of the experience which makes things so much more fun. He is also from the Sahara, not Marrakech, thus his knowledge of the surroundings you will encounter throughout the tour are a lot more in depth and interesting to listen to."

He picked me up from my Riad on time trip starts at 7am and we started the journey through the High Atlas Mountains, making brief stops for pictures and tea/coffee break. Abdul is personable and very professional, and his knowledge and passion about his country is impressive! We talked about culture, politics, history, and how he started in the Tourism business. I got to know Abdul not just as a tour guide/driver, but as a friend. The UNESCO world heritage site of Ait Ben Haddou is beyond words beautiful, I felt like traveling back in time! The Taourirt Kasbah is also a wonderful place to visit, as well as the Atlas Studios where they filmed movies such as The Mummy, The Passion of Christ, and Prince of Persia, to name a few. On the way back, we stopped for some refreshments overlooking the mountains and Abdul taught me how the Moroccans drink their mint tea and he introduced me to eating cactus or prickly pears as they call it. I got back to my Riad at around 8pm, tired but fulfilled. Abdul is an excellent, safe driver and his van is comfortable and well-maintained. I highly recommend him to anyone planning a trip to Marrakech! Thank you Abdul for making my trip memorable!"

We visited Quarzazate where we toured through a 17th century palace and a movie studio where they filmed scenes from \"Gladiator\" , \"Romancing the Stone\" and more. Then we visited the old Berber city of \"Ait Ben Haddou\" which sits on a hill overlooking the valley, for me this was a true highlight.

This tour to Ouarzazate City, Taourirt Kasbah, Atlas Studios, then to Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah through High Atlas Mountains & Berber villages had wonderful scenery with lots of photo opportunities. This trip is long starts at 7 and we got back around 12 hours later with driving through some twisty roads so beware if you have issues with motion sickness. However, our guide Abdul was very considerate and stopped the van frequently for fresh air and breaks even without my asking. I feel that we spent a touch too long at Atlas Studios on a tour that did not provide very much information and was given in two languages as only half the group spoke English. Ait Ben Haddou is gorgeous but it was very hot and the climb to the top of the city was worth straining ourselves a bit. One thing I did not love our lunch stop at Ait Ben Haddou which was a rather touristy place to be expected and we the waiter did not allow us to order a la carte even though a table next to us was able to. As such, it was our most expensive lunch in Morocco and was our worst meal in Morocco. Luckily, the scenery, tours, and conversations with Abdul made up for this mediocre lunch experience. If you only have time for one day trip from Marrakech definitely take this one as it is incredibly informative and stunningly gorgeous tour to Ait Ben Haddou."

There is a reason why everyone is raving about this guy: he's good at his job. But, without getting into too much of an Abdul-hype, here's what you can expect from the tour. You'll be picked up early in the morning from either your hotel or from an arranged check-point, which is usually nearest road. We stayed in a Riad in the Medina Souks, so we had a short walk out to the Dar el Bacha (Royal Palace) and high street (the backstreets are well lit, even in the early morning, so the walk was pleasant). Abdul's car is air-conditioned; I already miss his (music) playlist; and the man, himself, is very knowledgeable with ready answers, lots of information, a keen eye for good photo-opportunities and a GSOH. By the end of the day, if not by the end of the long drive across the Atlas Mountains (approx. 4 hours, one way), you'll have learned so much that you'll find yourself smiling if anyone else tries to teach you the same things afterwards - because 'Abdul already told you that'. At Taourirt Kasbah in Morocco's Hollywood, Ouarzazate City, you'll hopefully meet Mohammed as your guide. He not only knows the history and culture behind the Kasbah and its restoration, he has worked on the special effects of some major films - some you may even know. At the movie studios, you'll walk through some of the sets used for films such as Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Body of Lies (2008), Kundun (1997), Asterix and Obelix (1992-), Gladiator (2000), The Mummy (1999), and - way in the distance - you'll see the city of Marine from Game of Thrones, Season Three (2011-). After that, is the beautiful fortress of Ait Ben Haddou. You'll get to walk up to its uppermost beacon tower for a panoramic view of the city, desert-land and the Atlas mountains. This trip is a great addition to any holiday, long or short, as you'll get to see Morocco from a side you won't see by simply staying in the city centre. All our entry fees for the Kasbahs and the Movie Studio were sorted by Abdul in advance of the trip. It is, however, rude not to tip anywhere in Marrakech/Morocco, so practise your Gentleman's Handshake for handing this over. The food-stops Abdul will take you to are pretty decent and, unlike some other tour guides, he doesn't expect you to buy things from market stalls, so he will walk straight past these - but if you want something, just say so, he'll be happy to wait for you. Same goes with pictures; he'll happily wait for you to take all the photos you want. Do keep an eye on the time, however, because you are doing a lot in a small period of time and there's so much to see, you'll find yourself so lost in looking at something you'll have to drag yourself away in order to have the time to see the next thing. But you never feel rushed.If you are the kind of person who'll worry about not buying things, don't be, because the tour gets you back by about 8pm and Medina's Jemaa el-Fnaa (market) is open until late - and they have EVERYTHING there, including the occasional snake charmer.This tour is great for anyone who is interested in things, and for anyone with a camera. If you have any special lenses, bring them. You won't regret it."

The palm grove is only about 15 minutes from the \"New town\" part of Marrakech. When we arrived there was another guide, Said, who took us on our camel tour. One thing I was really happy about is that the camels looked happy and healthy, well taken care of. Even the guide, Said, told us how much he loves his camels and how to him they are like more than animals. So about halfway through the camel walk, we stopped at a house where a lady brought us mint tea and Berber style crepes with honey and olive oil. Overall, the camel walk and tea stop lasted about two hours. We got some GREAT photos... Both Said and Abdul made sure of that!! Highlight of our vacation by far!!"

We had food with two Berber families, spent the day looking at stunning views and even climbed to top of a waterfall with an experienced guide ( bring grippy shoes) ! The best part of the trip was spending the day with Abdul who was fantastic and so passionate about what he does. Thank you so much, love Steve and Charlotte.Book on Viator! Much better than travel agent excursions !"

Our stops at the casbahs, museum and restaurants started with great treatment from staff/locals who Abdul talked to before we approached them. Felt he went the extra mile to make it a good experience. Was also very warm so Abdul made sure we started with water as well as stopping off when we wanted just to get water and eat. Would recommend this to anyone wanting to get a good feel of life in Morocco and snippets of its history. Top marks from me"

At the end of the trip he gave me lots of advice on what to do in Marrakech as well as some places to visit during my time in Fez! I genuinely had the best day! We visited so many places; the cinema studio, a kasbah, a Berber village, a women's cooperative of Argan oil! As well as stopping many times a long the way so I could take photos of the incredible landscape! He was so kind, and even stopped on our way home on the side of the road so I could try so cactus!

First and foremost Abdul our driver and tour guide arrived very promptly at the hotel where my fianc\u00e9 and I were staying. He was extremely helpful and very knowledgable.The tour itself was amazing. We stopped off in a village outside of Marrakech where we were invited to drink tea with one of the locals inside her family home. We watched as she prepared the delicious Moroccan tea, which I must say takes great skill and patience. We then went on to climb up one of the mountains in the first valley where we stopped off by a waterfall to relax for a while. The second valley saw Abdul take myself and my fianc\u00e9 to a Berber village where a nice family prepared a local 3 course meal. The setting was absolutely picturesque as we ate on a hillside overlooking the small village. They were very welcoming and were genuinely happy to receive us. During the 3rd valley we drove through it stopping off in multiple locations to take pictures. Abdul was all too willing to take us our photos.All in all it was an experience that neither myself or fianc\u00e9 will never forget and left us wanting more. Thank you!"

I wanted to say how truly wonderful our tour with Abdul was for my wife & I. We chose the tour to the Sahara for camel rides and an over night stay with the Bedouins but we also customized our trip and added other stops along the way. Abdul was extremely accommodating and took such great care of us. The camel rides and overnight in the Sahara was definitely unique and fun but I think the best part was spending time with Abdul; visiting unique towns and shops along the way, learning about the various cultures and customs, and making a new life-long friend. I can't remember the cost but it was very reasonable for a planned 2 night/3 day trip. Transportation was in a comfortable new mid-size van and we never felt unsafe at any time; even on the mountain roads and passes. He's an excellent driver and as a guide he has a very easy-going relaxed manner that puts you at ease right away. I couldn't recommend a better guide or traveling companion. He's the absolute best guide and companion we've had in any country. If you need space, you've got it. If you want him to be more actively involved with you; he's right there for you. Our trip was in the first week of December 2014 and happened to coincide (after we'd crossed the Atlas) with what turned out to be a 100 + year massive destructive flood. On the day we needed to return to Marrakesh we discovered that landslides and massive flooding had closed both passes we could choose from to get back to Marrakesh. Flooding of riverbeds that hadn't seen water in years were wiping out roads, homes and businesses, and closing roads. Thank God for Abdul and his experience, knowledge, and professionalism! What could've been a nightmare scenario was handled very very well. We 're laid-back seasoned travelers & although bus loads of other travelers were freaking out, we remained calm with the hand we'd been dealt, as did Abdul. He seemed to know people and places to stay and eat at every little town we got stuck in. We never felt unsafe and were soooo glad we had Abdul taking care of things. We ended up spending 2 extra nights before the water receded and the landslides were cleaned up. But the Moroccan government was well organized, responsive, and was quick to get repairs done and open the passes. With Abdul as our guide, we had an incredible trip despite the difficulties and viewed the whole affair as more of an adventure than a headache. We can't wait to go back to see more of Morocco and spend more time with Abdul. He was FANTASTIC!!"

The excursion took us out of the bustle of the city in air conditioned comfort, and showed us the beauty and culture of the mountain areas. The waterfall walk was particularly stunning, the descent coinciding with a call to prayer from a local minaret. Lunch in the Berber village was well off the tourist track and an enlightening insight to the Berber way of life, besides a fabulous meal. Our guide, Abdul, spoke brilliant English and supplied comprehensive commentary as well as many photo stops. We plan to return to Marrakech, and will certainly look up Abdul and his company to see what other trips he is offering."

After first visiting a Berber house (and drinking tea) we continued up into the valley where we were introduced to Abdul, our other guide for taking us further up on foot. Abdul again was a real pleasure to talk to and a wealth of knowledge, being Berber himself. We then got to the waterfalls which were beautiful and later took a stunning root down, back to Ismail who was waiting patiently for our arrival. We then visited some women making Argan Oil were we got to try and smell many of things they had to offer. Heading on we travelled higher and through some incredible scenery that can be found throughout these three valleys. Later we stopped for some home cooked food which was delicious, and carried on back down towards the market. This was very different to the markets found in Marrakech and was a real insight to the local way of life. The tour was absolutely fantastic and we would recommend it to anyone, definitely worth the time."

This really set the trip apart from others as Abdul had personally found the family and the location to host his guests.

He always made sure we were comfortable and stopped en route to let us take photos as well as have a short mint tea break! The drive to our first proper stop was just over 3 hours and a half but with the rest stops and photo opportunities, as well as the information Abdul was providing, the time went by very quickly.Itinerary:Abdul picked us up at 7 at our hotel and then we started our drive through the mountains, which was a very pleasant drive! We then arrived in Ourrzazate for our first proper stop and had a tour of Taourirt Kasbah in Ourrzazate which was very interesting and well worth doing. After this we had a choice of a smaller film museum or the film studios - we chose the latter. Although the film studios were not hugely cultural, it was still quite interesting. We then had lunch near Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah which was quite nice. After this, we spent the rest of the day in the Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah which was truly spectacular - it is no wonder it is a world heritage site! After this we drove back to Marrakech and arrived at our hotel around 8pmThe benefits of doing this trip is a very comfortable car (almost like a ford Galaxy), an excellent driver, free entry to the museums which means no hassle whatsoever, and also a good variety of things to do. I would highly recommend this day trip, even if you are only in Marrakech for a few days. Also, I left my earphones in Abdul's car and he dropped them off the next morning at our hotel and called us to make sure I had received them - great service!"

Many only dream of returning to the motherland, so when planning for our recent trip to Morocco Africa aka Marghrib, I wanted to be sure to select the perfect Tour Guide. When I first came across Morocco Inspiring Tours, I was a bit skeptical due to the very few reviews they have on Trip Advisor. As a Muslimah convert, it was important that I have an authentic experience, that included Halal foods, time for prayer, and visits to historically Islamic landmarks. Additionally, i wanted to learn about the Indigenous and Saharan tribes. Inspiring Tours was not only affordable but they were also immediately responsive, attentive and accommodating of all of my requests. From the moment we arrived at the airport to our final goodbyes, the guides were extremely professional. Abdul, Ismael, Muhummad, and Mouhssin were always courteous, patient and ready to share their abundance of knowledge! We often had long drives, but the good conversation helped the time pass quickly. We traded stories, riddles, songs, pictures. We discussed Hip Hop, faith, language, culture, history and even had a Moroccan Mint Tea pouring competition before dinner one evening!For three large families traveling together out of the country for the first time, the guides made our trip very special by joining us for meals and always ensuring that everyone was \"good\"! They were so thoughtful, inclusive and encouraging of all the children both Muslim and non. They met them where they were as first time travelers yet challenging them to discover and try new things constantly. Ishmael raced along the beach, took selfies, carried tired little ones, answered a million questions, conversed in both Spanish, Arabic and English and watched out for them as if he were their big brother. All three of our families ( 15 in total) have even been inspired to continue language studies and have a newfound appreciation for so many cultural identities including tea and herbal remedies indigenous to the area! All thanks to this team of committed guys!They really seem as if they were born to do this kind of work! They have numerous relationships with people and places across the country! From modern to traditional, if you are one who likes more trendy/ tourist places or if you are open to off the grid spots, they know all the good spots! We got to experience the very trendy tourist belly dancing at Comptoir, stayed in both a contemporary hotel, and a riad, and got to taste the local tagin, and rarely found Medfounna typically only found in the Risani area. The Dramadeer rides in the Sahara and the exhausting road trip through the mountains was all worth it! The experience has been life changing and these guys come highly recommended!"

While this was my fourth visit to this beautiful country, there is always something magical and enchanting to newly discover. Moroccans are wonderful hosts, extremely welcoming and have a genuine desire to ensure that your visit to their country is fulfilling and satisfying. One of the best ways to enhance your experience is to hire a professional guide/driver to see the country and Morocco Inspiring Tours is just the ticket. The staff include Abdoul, Ismael, Mouhsin and Mohammed, all of whom were very friendly and engaging. This visit included overnight and day trips to Rabat, Casablanca, Essouria, Atlas, Ourzazate and the Sahara in Merzouga, all from our base in Marrkech. I worked directly with Abdoul to plan our 9 day visit for a group of 16 people and then a smaller group of 3 people. The vehicles were very comfortable and we always felt safe with their driving. Based on our wishes, Abdoul was able to create an itinerary that was filled with adventure, beautiful vistas, historical sites, camel rides on the beach for children, evening entertainment, amazing food and most importantly an opportunity to authentically engage with people. We also requested a spur of the moment major itinerary change and even with such a large group, they were patient, calm and accommodating. All you have to do is be present in the moment and open your mind and heart to exploration and discovery! We shared and exchanged stories with them about our families, work, politics, religion, laughed out loud, and most of all the experience of human connections. With Moroccan Inspiring Tours, there is no problem that can't be solved, including airport transfers, booking hammam appointments, hotel stays, cell phone charging and wifi access while on the road, interpretation and shopping. Everything is \"as you like!\""

After our climb we journeyed to a Berber village where we had once of the best meals of our trip. The view from the terrace was amazing. After lunch, the rest of the day was spent driving through the different valleys, stopping along the way for photo op after photo op. I'm glad we are in the age of digital because I probably would have gone through about 10 rolls of film on this tour. On our drive back to Marrakech, Abdul gave some unique perspective on life in Marrakech. We really enjoyed learning about life growing up in Morocco. Thank you Abdul for a wonderful experience. We wish you well and will always remember our Atlas Mountains adventure."

            "review": "A great week in Morocco. We used the Morocco Inspiring Tours excursions as offered by our Riad and we can highly recommend the tours with Ismail and Abdul especially if you travel with young kids. Both drivers spoke excellent English, were very friendly, attentive and committed to giving us a good time. The cars were very clean, spacious people carriers. When people say, you can get the tours cheaper \u2013 yes, you can but it depends on your travel preferences. If you travel alone and don\u2019t mind sharing the bus with 20+ others to get straight from A to B, you will get it half the price down the road. In our case, we felt we got great value for money. The Marrakech Sightseeing Tour for example, cost us in total \u20ac45 and it was a personalised experience i.e. just the four of us in the car with the driver (Ismail) who was funny, knew lots about Marrakech, took our kids into consideration and stopped whenever we wanted to jump out for photos or have a look at places and he showed us so many beautiful places like the Bahia Palace or Majorelle Garden. His brother Abdul who drove the other two tours did the same. We enjoyed both days with him and had a great experience. Abdul was also the one who picked us up from the airport, organised through the Riad, even with a flight delay \u2013 he waited for us and welcomed us to Morocco in the middle of the night with a smile. I travelled to many places in the world, experienced various excursions and the ones offered here were very good. We did three in total and we highly recommend the Marrakech Sightseeing Tour and the Ourika Valley Tour (a day Trip to the Atlas Mountains through Berber villages and waterfalls). You get a combination of guided and independent touring which allows for many photo opportunities, getting to know the area and meeting locals as well as knowing you\u2019re being looked after. We were each time picked up in the Medina near where we stayed which was an added bonus and made us feel very safe. Overall we had an amazing trip. We saw so much and learned even more."

            "review": "Full day up to the High Atlas Mountains. The day begins very early, with a personal pick-up at your hotel. We were staying across from the train station at the Opera Plaza, (fantastic place with indoor Olympic-sized oasis pool!) which I have described in detail in another post. Abdul arrived promptly at seven in a clean minivan, perfectly-sized for our small party. Driving in Marrakech can be an adventure unto itself - with donkey carts, two lanes that inexplicably mushroom into six, and the ever-present motorcycles weaving in and out, but Abdul handled the traffic like a pro. We made our way through Marrakech itself, via the palace area that skirts the Old Medina walls. Once we were clear of the city, we begin to climb into the desert, winding through dramatic switchbacks as we made the ascent toward the High Atlas Mountains, passing village sites where the Berber people have lived for millennia. The scenery here is part of the experience, changing from palm trees to scrub to desert in just a few miles. Ultimately our morning destination was the Atlas movie studio location where numerous films have been made - Quarzazate - but on the way we made several interesting pit-stops. We stopped briefly to see Argon Oil being made at a Women's Cooperative (extremely labor intensive process! Cooperatives like this are an important source of income for local women - think micro-finance - and well worth seeking out when traveling. I will not mindlessly slather on the oil again in future without thinking of the ladies who harvest the nut, break it open with a hammer, grind in into pieces and then mash it to remove the precious oil that is so good for hair and skin!) Then it was off to a quick stop at a local event honoring Special Olympics participants and their families. A side note here: it is very encouraging that the people of Morocco support some of the weakest members of their society in this way! Midmorning, we stopped at a Kasbah, home to one of the Berber families tasked with governing during the French occupation (from the late 1800s to late 1950s). Touring this particular Kasbah, we began to understand the link between architectural design and the arid climate: wide, covered porches, thatched and mudded roofing systems, interior air-drafts, enclosed courtyards, complete with original tile-work featuring inscriptions from the Koran, as well as the geometric designs prevalent in the Berber culture - similar to a Riad but on a grander scale. Here, everyone from the local population to visiting dignitaries were ushered into the upstairs inner sanctum to meet with the Berber equivalent of a local Sultan. Don't miss the local artists busily painting desert scenes in one of the upstairs balcony areas!Then it was onward - and upward - past the highest point in Africa - 'Tizi N'Tichka (over 2200 meters high) toward Quarzazate. This is a surprisingly large city, given how incredibly difficult it must be to get people and supplies up there. I can only imagine that most of the people have lived there for generations and have no need to go elsewhere, and there IS a steady stream of traffic up that two-laned curvy road, but still! Apparently the movie people fly into the small airport and skip the switchbacks. Over the years, the studios have been the set for numerous films: Cleopatra, Gladiator, Mission Impossible, The Bible series with Roma Downey, The Jewel of the Nile with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner and a French film that involved Spinx-like creatures with Crocodile heads (the set is still there!) Although expensive to film epic movies of this sort, given the 10:1 economy of Morocco to the US/Canada/Europe, it must be cost-effective and provides a needed boost to the economy locally.The final stop of the day, after lunch, of course, was to the UNESCO world heritage site at Ait Ben Haddou, which served as a backdrop to the city of Yunkai in The Game of Thrones. Originally built over 400 years ago as a fortified city along a major trading route with Sudan (think African Silk Road), the complex has held up remarkably well. Families still live in some parts, and if you close your eyes for a moment you can \"see\" life the way it would have been in the 1600s. Amazing!After a full day of touring, Abdul now had the unenviable job of getting us safely back down the mountains. Past construction projects designed to widen the road in places, through miles of the morning's switchbacks in reverse, back down from 2200 meters we went, to arrive, ultimately, back at our hotel, safe and sound.I have to commend our driver Abdul for his patience with our many questions, his willingness to make unscheduled stops (I did really need a postcard stamp from Quarzazate!) and his professionalism in conducting the tour, but most of all for his driving skills!"

We were picked up close to our riad, in a comfortable and spacious people carrier. Abdul our guide introduced himself and spoke very good English. It took an hour or so to reach the Atlas mountains. We stopped at a argan oil cooperative where we has the chance to see how the oil was made and have a little go ourselves. We then moved further into the mountains where we met out 'local' guide for the walk to the waterfall. Our guide was very friendly and helpful. He did a fantastic job a making sure my Mum felt comfortable and safe while scrambling up the rocks and over the shallow streams. We had a break half way through the walk at a little 'cafe' where we could enjoy some beautiful views of the waterfall, the valley and the snow topped mountains.From there we went onto the second valley where we had a lovely meal on the terrace of a berber house. We then moved onto the third and final valley and the berber market. If you are looking for crafts and souvenirs to take home then you'll be disappointed (unless you want to bring a goats head home...), but if you are wanting you experience the sights, sounds and smells of a traditional berber market then you'll not be disappointed. Not once did we feel rushed by Abdul or our local guide. Abdul was very accommodating to my snap happy fingers, providing plenty of opportunities to stop and take photos or stopping especially if there was something we wanted to see. We had lots of questions and Abdul was always pleased to answer them. We felt safe in Abdul's care, he was a very safe and cautious drive. The sights and views on this tour were beautiful and the day was broken up by a mix of activities. Oooh. My Mum left her hat in the vehicle. Abdul made contact with our riad and he went out if his way to return the hat to my Mum at our riad the very next day.Fab trip and excellent tour guide :-) Thanks Abdul"

Since it was our first trip to Morocco we opted to pay a bit more to be the only three riding with him. We got up early in the morning and Abdul walked into the Souk to meet us at our Riad dour. He arrived promptly, well dressed and was very friendly. We proceeded to spend the next 10 hours driving with him the first day, stopping at about a dozen places headed south to the meeting point with the camels, and about 12 hours with him the next headed back North to Marrakech. He was amazing. His knowledge of his country was incredible and he joined us for most of our excursions, explaining everything he could to us during our first (of many) trips to Marrakech. We ended up having such a trusting experience we hired him to drive us from Marrakech to Casablanca for an early morning flight out. It may have cost a few dollars more but we knew we were in good hands.He was amazing and all three of us kept his info for our next trip to Morocco. Highly recommended."

We spent the day in the easy, cheery company of Abdul who drove and guided us around to a fixed, itinerary but with the aim to please. We were happy going along with the Berber cultural tour on the way to what we considered the main event which was to get out and walk in the mountains. Once we'd agree the level of challenge we wanted to take on (As sissy as possible), he fixed us up with a very charming and reassuring local guide who you could've equally trusted to take your kids up the north face of the Eiger. Back in the motor, Abdul was as chatty as we wanted him to be, no more, which is nice. He was informative, helpful and accommodating. By the time we got back to Marrakech, we understood the place better and enjoyed it the all the more."

We had our dinner under the starry sky with candles. The starry night in Sahara is definitely breathtaking! We rode camels to the camping site but the next morning we didn't want to ride camels anymore, Zouhair arranged a 4X4 to pick us out of the desert, and also we enjoyed dune bashing.

I was very apprehensive as I was travelling with my family and two autistic sons. I intitally contacted Zouhair by email and he responded very quickly. We kept in contact until i arrived to Marrekesh.On the day of the trip Zouhair arrived on time which was great as my boys find it difficult to wait, we where in fact running late but Zouhair reassured me it was ok.We travelled in a very comfortable and clean car with WiFi which was great for my teens and husband. Zouhair was very knowledgeable about the locality and kept us entertained along the way, A part of day out we visited a traditional berber house which was great, Zouhair showed us around the house and we finished off by having refreshing mint tea. We arrived to Atlas mountains around midday after a short break my husband and daughter went for a trek while i remained with the other children at the restaurant. We had lunch at the resturant while we waited and my kids played about, the manager did not mind which was great relief for me. My husband arrived after 2 hours with my daughter having throughly enjoyed the trek and stunning waterfalls, after some snacks we made the journey home. We needed to make a stop along the way which was no problem at all for Zouhair, he also picked and dropped us off outside our hotel which was quite far from central Marrekesh with no fuss whatsoever. I would not hesitate to recommend Easy Jet Go Private tours, Zouhair went out of his way to make us comfortable and meet our needs as a family."

I communicated with him in USA about two weeks before our planned visit to Marrakech via Whatsapp. Even with the time difference he usually replies within an hour or two. He answered so many questions and provided advice on things that didn't even have to do with the Day trip we planned with him.My husband and I really wanted to see the goats in the tree so we decided to do the day trip to Essaouira. Very reasonably priced at 600 Moroccan Dirhams per person, about $130 US dollars for both of us. It was as awesome as we expected. Zouhir found a way to pick us up right by the Riad we were staying at even though it was quite tough to get to through all the small streets. The van is very clean as he gets the car cleaned daily, has air conditioning (which was a MUST for my husband) and wifi so we could email, chat and browse social media during the ride there and back. We got to take pictures with the goats on the tree, see how the Moroccan ladies make pure argan oil and take pics on the camels (mini ride) just giving them all small tips.At the end of the day, the most important thing about these private tours is the guide you are with and Zouhir is the best man you can count on!"

Zouhir picked us up on time from the front of our hotel and instantly made the kids happy by telling them that they could use the wifi in the car. As we drove to our first stop Zouhir was full of useful information about the surrounding areas and answered all our questions. We arrived at the Berber house not sure what to expect but was made to feel very welcome after a tour we sat down to enjoy the best mint tea ever with lovely bread,oil,butter and honey. A short car journey and we stopped for a camel ride this was great fun, then a stop at the argon oil cooperative which was interesting. Then we drove further into the mountains to Setti Fatma a bustling little village where we were introduced to our guide Hassan, who took us right to the top of the waterfalls where the views was amazing and well worth the trek. It was then back down for lunch in Setti Fatma to a restaurant that Zouhir recommended, we all had some lovely mixed skewers served with rice,chips and salad at a very good price. We then started the drive back to Marrakech thankful of the aircon in the car, Zouhir even stopped on the way to buy us some gifts that we our very thankful for. Please book Zouhir for any trips whilst you are in Marrakech as he is truly professional and will make any day you spend with him an absolute delight."

So if you want the best tour guide book Zouhir Bengo you will not be disappointed, this was the highlight of our holiday."

Then to the Argan oil co op to see how the oils are extracted and then up to Sitti Fatma for lunch on the river. We opted out of going to the waterfalls which meant we were able to take time to relax by the river and never felt rushed to move on.The last time we came to Marrekesh we were stood up by a tour guide who booked an excursion but never turned up. I was wondering if this was going to happen to us again but Zouhir restored my faith in tour guides and we will only ever use him again when returning to Marrekesh, hopefully next year to do his trip to the dessert.Thank you very much Zouhir for sharing your beautiful country with us."

I was really ill the night before our our trip & I was only able to give him 2 hours notice of canceling. He told me this wasn't a problem and I should just concentrate on getting better. We postponed to the next day and although he had an airport pick up he was still able to work around things to make it possible for us to still go.Me & my family had an amazing time with Zouhir on this trip. From the very first moment we met him we felt comfortable & relaxed in his presence. He's so friendly & chatty that it doesn't feel awkward at anytime over the day trip. The children took to him instantly and he was really good with them too. Zouhir has a lovely people carrier to drive you around in, he keeps it spotlessly clean and its equipped with aircon which is a big plus in the heat. He also supplied us with some bottles of water.We set off on our trip with Zouhir answering any questions & giving us useful knowledge and information about anywhere we ask or he thought was of importance.Zouhir stopped whenever we asked him too, wether it be for something that caught our eye or because the children needed something to eat or drink. He took us to some great places for photos before taking us to meet a lovely Berber family who made us very welcome. We were able to have a look around their house and try some of the lovely mint tea & bread they'd made. After that we travelled on to Sitti Fatma, stopping at some more great places for photos, Zouhir was always helpful taking pictures when wanting family shots. He even carried my 4yr old across a brigde so she could have a photo on there. When we got to Sitti Fatma Zouhir took us to a really nice place to eat, it was very reasonably priced too. The food was great & Zouhir bought us some fresh cherries to snack on. It was right on the river front so the kids were able to go paddling in the water. Overall we all had such a great time! it was so relaxed & comfortable. With it being a private tour everything is done at your own pace & you have the flexibility with Zouhir to tailor it completely to your own needs. We chose not to do the guided walk to the waterfalls because we thought it would be too hard for our children, this was no problem as its all about what you want to do.So if you'd like to do this trip or something similar you really won't go wrong booking with Zouhir. From the moment you send him the first text or Whatsapp he's right there to help with any bookings.Thanks so much Zouhir & if we ever return to Marrakech I will certainly contact you again."

Zouhir's knowledge and love of Morocco was infectious. He is also fantastic company and knows exactly when to be chatty and when to allow downtime -so important on a long trip. He made sure we had regular breaks and opportunities to take photos and that we really felt he made our priorities his priorities. He also made certain we were looked after, even keeping a watchful eye on street vendors and intervening to haggle down prices if he thought we weren't getting the best deal. We had an extremely ambitious itinerary and were amazed and so grateful that Zouhir's enthusiasm and professionalism never wavered, even after 2 consecutive days of 15hr drives! We should also say we arrived well after our connecting train to Casablanca (or any other train) had departed and he personally escorted us to the coach station and then the local bus station and negotiated our seats on the last bus out of town. Zouhir must have been exhausted by this time and this kindness was both way above the call of duty and testament to his commitment to looking after his clients. You need this man for any significant trip you plan to take in Morocco!Cal & Parisa"

Hello!First of all I just can recommend the 3-Day-Desert-Tour with Zouhir Bengo!He really cared about everything! We started the tour from Marrakech. Due to the fact Zouhir speaks English, German, Spanish, Italian, French etc. you can almost choose, which language you prefer. The first day of the tour we visited the Atlas Mountains and stayed the first night in a very, very nice hotel in Dades, which Zouhir has chosen by himself. The trip was always relaxed, we had enough time to enjoy all the different places and there was always time for some stops to get a coffee. Zouhir also had a lot of extra information about everything, so he was not just a driver, in contrast to other guides, some people, we talked to, had the experience with other companies. He always knew the best places for photos, the best ways to walk to get the best views and where to get cheap and good food. The second day we have been to the Todra Gorge at first. At late evening we arrived at the place, where to start the camel ride to our Berber camp in the desert. Before the ride we even made a stop with Zouhir to get some beer to enjoy the sunset in the desert. The ride through the Sahara to our camp was a really nice experience, we had time to take some pictures and got to know some people, so we had good company at the camp. We even were lucky enough to get an upgrade to the luxury camp with shower und toilet in the tent. At the camp you can go sandboarding, enjoy the sunset, the moon and the stars at the fire place. Zouhir also joined us at the camp and so we had a really great time.All in all I would definitely book the tour with Zouhir Bengo again, because it is probably the best one you can get. He was the most carrying tourguide I ever had and this made Marocco really welcoming for us! He always had these little surprises for us and can give you a lot of information, which made this tour excellent!"

Nothing was too much trouble and he was a very kind person with a lot of knowledge about Marrakech as well as other places in the world he has visited and livedI can recommend Zouhir as a guide for any trip in Marrakech you would like to do. He answered all our question before and during the tour and I'm sure he would be there after our tour if we had any questions. Lovely guy who makes sure your visit is wonderful as well as comfortable. Thank you again so much Zouhir, I will post pictures once I'm home"

We were glad he did as Zouhir was fantastic. We did the 3 valleys tour which included a visit to a Berber house where we served mint tea, lunch at Setti Fatma and Lalla Takerkoust. Zouhir spoke excellent English was extremely friendly and was more than happy to stop where we wanted for photographs. We were picked up and dropped off near to our Riad at the time stated. We intend to return and will definitely be exploring further afield next time and would not hesitate to contact Zouhir to arrange this."

We had originally booked the Ouzoud waterfall trip but it was raining on the day - thankfully Zouhir suggested the Essaouira trip and not only did we avoid the rain, we stopped to see the world famous argan tree goats as well! Zouhir is your driver guide rolled into one and very informative providing facts and tips along the way. His new mini van is super comfortable and we were provided with water as well. Very important to note is the fact that Zouhir is a careful driver and that there are seatbelt sifted. Perfect for families. En route we stopped at an Argan Oil cooperative where we bought high quality yet very reasonably priced Argan oil. It's truly amazing stuff - don't buy the cheap stuff in the markets.Essaouira, an old coastal town is beautiful and it was wonderful to wander around the fort and the quiet souks. Zouhir even recommended a great fish restaurant by the sea on the edge of the beach for lunch. We had a wonderful day and are so glad we visited this quaint little town. A fabulous day!"

All my e-mail enquiries were answered promptly and good advice given to enable us to make the most of our holidays in Marrakech.Zouhir has done his best to assure that our holiday in Marrakech would be unforgettable for me and my family.The first trip we\u2019ve made was to the Ouzoud waterfalls. This is a good escape from the city and enjoy the nature by visiting the Ouzoud Falls. Zouhir\u00a0\u00a0showed us the olive trees, spoke about the local traditions, history and legends of the waterfall and about the Moroccan culture.We had lunch in one of the terrace restaurants. The food was very tasty and if you love cats and monkeys\u00a0you are going to see one in every corner of the terrace. :)The falls are amazing to look at, one of the highlight of our Morocco trip and a must do when in these parts. We saw it both from the top and from the bottom.Our second trip was to the Ourika valley. Visiting Ourika valley is a great way to spend some peaceful time away from the madness of Marrakech. A day trip is enough to see the beauty of the mountain, admire the waterfalls, enjoy a lunch near the river in Sidi Fatima village. If you are lucky you can even spot some monkeys in their natural environment.\u00a0Zouhir arranged 1 of the best guides Jamal for ttekking in the mountains! Highly recommended as he knows alote about the region and his really a kid of the mountains! :)Our third trip was to the beautiful\u00a0city Essaouira with white and blue walls.This is a working fishing village about 2 hr drive from Marrakesh. The drive was a bit long but the village was pleasant to visit. There were fish for sale on the docks and the normal shops and restaurants to choose from. Not having Fish as lunch in Essaouira is quite impossible!:) Thanks to Zouhir we had a great trial of all different kind of fish as lunch!:) The highlight of our trip were the goats in the Argan tree!Our last but not the least tour was a half day in Marrakech.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Zouhir showed us the Palmeraie side were we had a camel tour. Also not to forget that we paid a visit to the Saadian tombs, Bahia palace and the Menara gardens!Zouhir was very informative on Marrakech history, culture, etc. Not to mention the tour was great at helping us get our bearings and way around the city/souks.I would highly recommend Zouhir for having an unforgettable, terrific and most rememorable expierence in and out of Marrakech!:) Thanks for everything Zouhir!"

We arranged an excursion with him to visit the atlas mountains and Sitti Fatma. From picking us up at our hotel lobby till dropping us off back to the hotel we had an amazing experience. He arranged for us a restraunt to have lunch which was right next to the river allowing us to dip our feet into the water, it was the sitti fatma restraunt. The guide he gave us for the mountains climb was Hassan who we also felt at ease with explaining places and parts of the mountain not many guides would normally tell you. We wanted to purchase a tagine on the return back to the hotel as the market products were very expensive and not of good quality. Zouhir took us to a good place on the way back home returning to the hotel which we appreciated very much not to mention the extra little tour of Marrakech showing us around the new city and good places to visit in the old city. Overall our experience with Zouhir was fabulous, his English was very clear for people who prefer English guides. The main thing was we felt very comfortable with him. Zouhir went out of his way for us many times and did a great deal if looking after. I would definitely recommend Zouhir to everyone who visits Marrakech."

It was long day trip, Mr Bengo didn't rush us like others, we did enjoy our trip so much. He was so kind looking after us when we got a bit car sick.

It was just a great pleasure to have been in the company of our private guide for the three day long trip to the Merzouga desert . From the very first moment, he was very responsive, informative and helpful. He gave us great advice on the trip, tailored every detail to our needs, and went the extra mile to make our trip fantastic. Zouhir talks fluently in many different languages (English, Spanish, German, French, Arabic) and is very knowledgable and ready to answer all your questions. His car is comfortable, clean and Zouhir himself is a great driver. The trip to the desert was spectacular, stopping at various photo points along the way including the Atlas Mountains, the Kasbah of Ait Ben Haddo, Ouarzazate, Dades Valley, Todra Gorges, etc. On the first night, Zouhir booked an amazing acommodation (Chez Pierre) with delicious dinner included, it was definitely one of the best meals I have ever had! The hotel was super comfortable, run by very friendly staff. After a long day driving, this was a really welcome stop. On our second day, we were then on our way to the desert in time for the sunset whilst riding camels to the camp. This is where the services offered by Zouhir go above and beyond any tour we have booked. Zouhir was also the only tour guide present during our stay, literally on-call 24/7. The actual experience of staring at the stars around a camp-fire with the local Berbers playing the drums and singing is definitely something I will never forget. Zouhir also told us it is possible to spend the night in the dunes under the star sky, which is what we did and we strongly recommend to every romantic soul. It can get a bit cold, but we took warm blankets from our tent and counted the shooting stars until the sun rise, which was a magical experience. Overall, Zouhir can not do enough for his 'guests'! If you want to have a hassle free amazing experience in Morocco, all you need to do is contact Zouhir. Thanks for everything!"

            "review": "Book with Zouhir! :) . We were a family of 9- consisting of 4 adults, and 5 children between the ages of 1-14. From the moment I contacted him, he responded to all me queries. It was nice, to finally get hold of someone, who listened and accommodated to all our wishes and concerns. He took care of us during our whole journey. He picked us up from the airport with a smile on his face, and kept in contact with us even during the days we were relaxing in the hotel to make sure we were okay. :) So the first tour we booked with him, was the zagora desert tour. Some of group fell sick on the way- and before moving ahead, he ensured they were feeling okay :) we stopped at lots of different spots on the way, and took photos, which was a nice way to break up the journey.. When we finally got to zagora, we left our mini bus, and travelled to our tents by camel.. We watched the sunset, which was totally amazing! When we arrived at our camp site, we were amazed at how cute it was! (Glamping) The tent was cute, with a comfy bed, electricity, warm water and plenty of spare blankets. Food served there was also awesome. We listened to the locals playing with their drums and singing away. Everyone joined in and had a laugh :) The next morning, we woke up early, hiked a sand dune- and watched the sunrise.. It was beautiful :) The second tour we had booked was to the ourika valley. This was by far, my most favourite trip... It was truly beautiful! We were able to hike up to the fourth waterfall, which was challenging and great fun! Our guide was amazing- he really took good care of the kids. :) and it's because of him, that I was able to hike with my little 1 year old.Our third tour was the ouzzad waterfall. This was less challenging then the ourika valley tour.. But the view of the waterfall was stunning :) Zouhir really went out his way, to make sure we had an awesome time.. For instance, he bought bananas before we reached, so we could feed the monkeys.. He paid for the kids to play on the horse.. He bought the kids little gifts.. He really goes out of his way.. Just to make sure everyone is happy.. :) We also booked a quad biking tour. I couldn't go, as I had to look after my 1 year old. But the rest of the group went. They went away for a few hours, and they came back sooo happy! Zouhir was kind enough to find a company to quad bike with and organised it for us. We decided we wanted to go for a spa day, so zouhir did his research and found this awesome spa! We wanted a traditional hammam and massage.. But we didn't want to share it with strangers. So he made sure, that we had two separate private hammams.. One for the boys, and one for the girls. We truly loved this experience. It was a nice end to our holiday.. Zouhir was also kind enough to show us Marrakech before the spa.. So we went to the medina gardens- which was stunning.. Saw the old city of Marrakech.. The old market.. Tombs.. We were able to experience and see parts of Marrakech, that we would have been never seen, if it wasn't for him.I can't recommend Zouhir enough. We have never had a tour guide that has gone beyond what they're supposed to do. He really goes out of his way- just to make sure each member of the group is happy. For instance- he took our clothes to the laundrette for us.. And bought back to the hotel for us. He made sure the transport that was used was suitable for us- modern and comfy. He changed parts of the itineraries to accommodate our needs.. He also gave an amazing deal on all our itineraries.. He didn't charge my 1 year old for anything.. The kids were only charged half price.. Etc"

Cannot emphasize how helpful and how accommodating Zouhir is. Local knowledge and honesty was second to none. Knew when to engage and when to give us space to marvel at the sites.Me and my wife thought the trip on the way to Ait bin Haddou was a highlight. The extra visit to the Berber house and 'cave' where we were allowed to play around with props from the gladiator movie was an added bonus which I don't think is offered by any other tour.We were then on our way to the desert in time for the sunset whilst riding camels to the camp. This is where the services offered by Zouhir go above and beyond any tour we have booked. As a newly married coupled, Zouhir booked us an upgraded private tent at the camp as a welcome present. He also took trips to the local supermarket on our account for drinks and cigs out of his own pocket. Zouhir was also the only tour guide present during our stay, literally on-call 24/7,The actual experience of staring at the stars around a camp-fire with the local Berbers playing the drums and singing is something me and my wife will cherish.

We found Easyjet Go tours on trip advisor. The communications was brilliant from Zouhir, we where able to whatapp him, and agree everything. (He speaks several languages)The trip was good from start to finish. Zouhir was early, unlike most people in Morocco.The journey to Marrekesh was comfortable. Zouhir has a 7 seater, leather seats, ac, etc. All seats have plenty of leg room. Zouhir was happy to stop off when we needed.Zouhir provides a great tour of Marrekesh. He took us to 3 different historic locations before lunch. As we was in Marrekesh, we wanted some authentic food. Zouhir took us to a roof top tagine resturant, where we had the best tagines food, really recommend the lemon chicken tagine. We where staying in a riyad, which was bit of a journey itself to get to. Lucky we had Zouhir with us. As he drove us nearly to the door step of the riyad (car could not go any further). He also arrange for the hotel rep to meet us at the drop off, to take us the rest of the way to the riyad. Only reason I am saying this, because when we got a taxi in the evening, he would refuse to go into the local roads, unlike Zouhir. Zouhir was even kind enough to wait for us to drop off our bags at the hotel, and take us to the markets, saved us getting a taxi. Even when we got back to agadir after our trip to Marrekesh, Zouhir should us the best local restaurants to go to, as we where getting fed up with the food. Overall Zouhir is a top guy, treat you with respect and is always professional. If I got back I would be definitely book Zouhir again"

He is humble, genuine, honest, just an outright top human being and it was a pleasure to meet him! We originally arranged just a half day tour of Marrakech but after a short what'sapp conversation he included transfers to and from Agadir at a very fair price. He was waiting in the lobby of our hotel bang on time greeted us with a massive smile and great enthusiasm. We were a group of 5 sizeable friends, Zouhir's van was extremely spacious and comfortable. Above all it was spotless, leather seats, air con positive luxury by any standards. His driving on the hectic streets of Morocco makes you feel safe which is a massive plus after some of the near death taxi rides we had experienced. He gave us information on all the areas we passed, as well as general day to day Moroccan life. On arrival in Marrakech, we had a half day tour taking in the main attraction of the city. He took us to a roof top tagine restaurant, the food, service and cleanliness was fantastic! He took us out to a palm tree covered area on the outskirts of the city to watch the sunset which was a great way to end the day. En route to our Riad he gave us loads of handy tips and hints on where to go what to avoid and how to stay safe. He went the extra mile by waiting for us to check in before giving us a lift to the main square at no extra cost. The following day again Zouhir was on time upbeat and ready to go. We had arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains but after a rather late night it was plain to see we were in no state to walk up and down hill sides. The change of plan was not at all a problem for Zouhir he took us back to Agadir happily making multiple stops to accommodate the needs of the group. On our return to Agadir Zouhir took us for lunch at a local cafe away from the tourist beach area. It was the best meal of the trip, fresh, tasty and cheap. Zouhir can not do enough for his 'guests'! If you want to have a hassle free amazing experience in Morocco all you need do it contact Zouhir. Thank you again brother. Hope to see you soon!"

Once we'd been there quite a while he introduced us to some lovely Moroccan tea. I should also mention that Zouhir is very good and careful at driving! He mentioned that he has a Moroccan and and European driving license which is very rare so it was easy to feel safe in the car with him as he drives so sensibly. I'm so glad we went on this trip, later on in our holiday I got ill and as Zouhir had our whatsapp number in order to contact us about the trip earlier on he knew, he was so kind! He brought medicine to our hotel for me and checked up on me through my partner until I was better. He truly is a gentleman and I feel we have gained a friend for the next time we visit. He is so easy to get along with, I would not hesitate to book with him again.Thank you for everything Zouhir!"

I got know the manager Mr Zouhir Bengo through a friend who has already used this service and he spoke really good of it so we thought to try it out. We wanted to explore Marrakech and its outskirts but we wanted someone honest and knowledgeable. We contacted Mr Zouhir and he arranged to a private trip to Ourika valleys. We were worried about the language barrier but amazingly Mr Zouhir spoke fluent English and Italian so it was nice knowing we are in good hands. Zouhir met us early in the morning in his clean car (rare in marrakech, no offence) and we headed off to the highway. Mr Zouhir was very friendly and easy going with us, someone who's passionate about what he does. Our first stop was in this beautiful mountain to take some pictures. Our 2nd stop was the barber house where Zouhir arranged a delicious breakfast with amazing people of the house with super delicious tea. We continued to drive through the beautiful outskirts of marrakech and Mr Zouhir arranged for us a trip with an amazing ourkia vally tour guide named hassan (i must say he is really cool and knows all the beautiful spots) we rolled on with mr hassan up the beautiful mountains headed towards to the amazing waterfalls it was one of the best experiences for us. We met really cool and easy going people on the way too. We spent about 2hours with mr hasan and we arrived back to an amazing restaurant by the waterfall with some seriously delicious food (i recommend lamp tagin!). We took some really cool snaps which i will attach. We headed back home and slept like babies on the way back home on those extra comfortable leather seats :p . Lastly, we were really impressed with mt Zouhir and his amazing hospitality. He made things really easy going for us and i will definitely recommend his services to all my friends and family."

Driven and guided by Zouhir to the Ouzoud Waterfalls.A very comfortable, friendly, and pleasant journey as Zouhir offered great knowledge of the beautiful surroundings as well as smooth driving as he has a European drivers licence, and a very nice car.. We also enjoyed a few stop-offs in passing towns for fruit and tea.Once we reached the waterfalls Zouhir led us down the side cliff on a private trek, enjoying the breathtaking views as we descended into the other side of the falls.Luckily we were advised to wear sport or mountain shoes prior to walking down the very steep cliffsides, with Zouhir kindly helping us down the more treacherous areas.We eventually reached the base of the falls which at this point was a fast flowing river with many smaller waterfalls every 20meters or so (see pictures). Word's simply can't describe the beauty of the place, and unfortunately the pictures don't do much justice either. But it was incredible looking back up at the cliffs we had just trekked down, and crossing the river on hopping stones and basic bridges. We even spotted and fed a few monkey on our way, and there were even people swimming in some of the pools of the river which looked quite fun.As we followed the river back up to the waterfall, we passed many other smaller waterfalls, stop-off points, tent hotels, small restaurants and souvenir shops which was fun. and once we finally reached the falls we enjoyed a cup to tea with Zouhir at a small cafe right at the bottom of the falls which was great. We then trekked up a few stairs on to a fantastic up-close viewing point, and another set of stairs to the area's best restaurant with another great view. We finalised our day walking up to a special monkey spot where we were able to feed a whole monkey family bananas and nuts Zouhir had bought for them which was amazing.Thank you so much Zouhir! Fantastic service! I look forward to another day trip with you on my next holiday to Morocco!"

He made the trip to Agadir enjoyable, showed us sites along the drive and made sure we as a family were always happy especially my little daughter. In comparison to other tour guides in morocco, our comfort and enjoyment was important to him and money was not the primary concern of zouhir. He allowed us plenty of time to enjoy the sites and beach in Agadir, and we never felt rushed. To top everything off, he in his own time found a wildlife park close to the beach for my daughter to go to, which he surprised us with. On the way back to the hotel he made another stop for us, which was an additional stop but yet again he did this with a smile. I was overly pleased with EasyJet Go's service and would definately recommend others to use it to have a beautiful and plesant stay in morocco."

I have never written a review before, but my husband and I enjoyed our tour so much with Zouhir Bengo that we were moved to write one. Due to time constaints ,we went against the recommended 3-4 day tour from Marrakesh to Merzouga, and decided to do it in 2 days. This could have been an uncomfortable disaster, but instead it was perfect. Zouhir picked us up right on time (he was actually early). We were excited to find out that we would have a wonderful, clean, spacious,private vehicle to ride in, and were even more excited to find out that the A/C worked very well. It didn't take us long to realize that Zouhir Bengo was a caring and trustworthy man that was truly interested his customers' comfort and enjoyment. It was a 12 hour trip to get to the desert by sunset. He stopped at some amazing sights along the way and was sure to give us just enough time for us to enjoy the experience, but still get to the desert in time. On our way back the next day, Zouhir added an extra stop (even though he had driven 20 out of the last 30 hours) because he found out we were interested in visiting the film studios. The studios had actually just closed, but he spoke to several people to get us in. Zouhir Bengo was a wonderful tour guide; safe, responsible, knowledgable, concerned with our comfort. But what I appreciated the most about him is his genuinely beautiful heart. He will spend time finding out exactly what you are interested in and then design a trip that is perfect for you. We HIGHLY recommend EasyJet Go Marrakech Private Day Tours! Thanks again, Zouhir!"

Right from picking us up at our Riad (having made sure he found the best place to park for convenience), the whole day was just perfect. Zouhir is polite, friendly, well spoken (in many languages) and smartly dressed. He is very knowledgeable about Marrakech and Morocco generally and made the whole journey very interesting. It's a long drive but we were so comfortable in his excellent vehicle with lots of room and comfort. He pointed out things of interest on route and kept us from being bored. A nice stop on route for coffee and snacks and also let us stop again to get water and some fruit. The falls are quite lovely and he managed to get us a table for lunch right at the edge of the terrace overlooking the waterfall, what a perfect spot. Lunch was very good value and beautifully cooked - very good choice on his part. He explained all the different options of going right down to the river and the possibility of taking a boat ride or swimming or just going to the viewing platform, browsing the nice little stalls on route and he even bought a bag of peanuts for us to feed the monkeys. We booked another trip around Marrakech with Zouhir and this was also just perfect. Obviously the scenery and the experience were fantastic but what really made this trip special was the care and attention Zouhir took in looking after our every need, listening to what we wanted and being possibly the nicest most polite person on earth. We won't forget his kindness or efficiency for a very long time. If you're thinking of booking tours whilst in Marrakech, I can't recommend him enough - reliable, trustworthy, friendly and took care of everything we could want - and lastly, his prices are very reasonable with no hidden extras. Cannot rate Zouhir highly enough."

It would be easy just to give a great rating and a few compliments but I really think it would be helpful to others considering booking through this company to know exactly WHY they get a good review. Where to start? Firstly when dealing via email before our trip - fantastic. Zouhir replies swiftly and answers all questions openly and honestly. He made it easy and simple to arrange details, no hassle, no complications. I'd approached several different tour companies and his fast replies and assurances were better than all the rest. Next, he worked with us to suit our needs not just his. He made sure we were happy with the arrangements and was flexible - we so didnt feel that we had to 'take it or leave it' - it felt tailor made for us. We booked several trips with him and the first one was to pick us up from our Riad - the location of which was hidden away in a total nightmare maze of alleyways in the Medina. He had made a special trip the day before our arrival to ensure he knew where it was and find the most convenient parking place near to the riad (so as not to inconvenience us) - very impressed at his concern for his customers. The first day trip was a tour around Marrakech, outside of the medina. This was lovely. He took us to lots of interesting places, let us wander around inside on our own at our leisure and was always waiting nearby when we returned. He then found us a lovely rooftop restaurant for lunch - great food, good prices and the nicest waiters on earth - great choice. He made sure we were seated where we wanted, understood the ordering process and menu and then left us to enjoy our meal in peace, coming back near the end to see if all was okay and if we were ready to move on. The second day trip was a lengthy one out to the Ouzod waterfall. A long drive but he made sure we were comfortable, stopped off for refreshments on route and also stopped a second time so we could stock up on water and some fruit. On route he pointed out various place of interest and made sure we were comfortable and answered questions etc. The trip was the day before my 60th birthday and just before leaving the falls and going back to the vehicle, he stopped at a stall and had them make a little plaque with my name in arabic as a birthday present - I was overwhelmed at his kindness.Lastly, we had arranged to revisit the lunchtime restaurant on the evening of my birthday and he sorted out the reservation etc., then made a special trip to pick us up from the Riad and take us to the restaurant - at his own expense! At the end of the meal, the waiters came over with some cake and started to sing happy birthday (much to my embarrassment - but very touched). I found out that Zouhir had arranged this. What more can you say - this chap is supremely polite, very caring and thoughtful, very knowledgeable about what to see and do, well dressed, well spoken, very reasonably priced and the vehicle used was top of the range being spacious, comfortable leather seating etc and he is a courteous and law abiding driver too - quite the exception in Marrakech believe me. I have honestly never encountered someone so customer focused and efficient on any trip I've taken before. Whatever your requirements - I can from the bottom of my heart recommend this gentleman (and that's what he is - a gentleman)"

After doing a lot of research online, I booked us a 3 day tour from Fes to Marrakech, with a night in the Sahara Desert at Camp Bouchedor and the Chez Pierre in the Dades Gorge. The price was very reasonable for a private car, accommodations, and breakfast/dinner. Our driver, Abdellah, picked us up from our hotel in Fes and showed us so many beautiful, unforgettable sights along our 3 day drive. Originally we had considered self-driving this route, but if we had, we would have missed so many sights and wouldn't have learned half as much about this beautiful country and it's amazing people. Abdellah was the perfect companion on this drive, more than happy to accommodate us whether it was to stop for the bathroom, to take a photo, make a shopping stop, etc... Anyone who is traveling to Morocco should take this drive. While the cities like Marrakech and Fes are awesome, the country side is more beautiful and diverse then I could have imagined. Because we had such a good experience during our 3 day drive, we decided to book a day trip to the Ouzud Falls, a transfer to Essaouira, and a transfer to Casablanca. During the end of our trip we had a different driver, Jouad. He was also incredibly kind and a great tour driver. He offered to take us to a local beach on a day off from driving, and made sure we saw the Hasan II Mosque in Casablanca (do not miss!). Overall, booking these drives/experiences with Authentic Tours was one of the best decisions we made during our trip. Not only was the booking process with Sabrine very easy (she even gave us some last minute hotel recommendations), to the feeling that we were just on a road trip with our new, good friends Abdullah and Jouad. It was a real pleasure, and I can't wait to return to Morocco to experience more of this beautiful country and to see our new friends again."

My husband and I had the pleasure of meeting them en route on the 4 day/3 night Marrakesh to Marrakesh Tour we took in May. They are most charming people and dedicated to providing a great service. I was particularly impressed with Sabrina's efficiency. She promptly replied to every e-mail I sent her and answered every question with exactly the information I required. We were looking forward to this (private) tour but it far surpassed our expectations. Each day was so different. We visited interesting places, saw some spectacular scenery and had unique experiences, such as the camel trek into the Sahara where we were soaked by rain, and lunch in a Berber home (arranged by the tour company at extra cost). However, it was our guide, Abdellah who made the trip for us. He was first and foremost a competent and safe driver. We had complete confidence in his ability and not once felt any anxiety. Secondly, he was well educated, spoke good English and was able to talk authoritatively on numerous subjects. We learnt so much about Morocco, the Berbers and Islam from him. His passion, enthusiasm for his job and his attentiveness to our needs was admirable and much appreciated. He has visited cafes all long the route so that whenever we wanted to stop for refreshments he knew the best cafes/restaurants, with the cleanest facilities. It is the company's policy not to take clients to shops unless requested. On the odd occasion we did ask, Abdellah, would take us to places, e.g. to see how the argon nut was processed, but would insist we did not have to buy.Finally and mostly importantly, Abdellah was good company and we had a lot of fun with him. He was friendly and always cheerful and it gave us great pleasure getting to know him.I have no hesitation in recommending this company, this tour, and this guide, our (now) friend Abdellah."

Abdul has planned and organized the tour very well. He picked beautiful and breath-taking places for us to take pictures. I enjoyed the view very much. We had a 5-day desert tour from Marrakech to Fes. Riding a camel into Sahara Desert was a great memory. Abdul our guide, was funny and informative. He told us about the places we were visiting. I am glad to have Abdul as our tour guide / driver. In fact, he was more than a guide, but a friend in Morocco. So I highly recommend asking for Abdul."

We couldn't have made a better decision. The tour was well organized and our driver / tour guide Abdul was absolutely amazing. Because there were only 4 people on the tour we were able to make stops where we wanted and really get to see the country at our own pace. You'll really see a great deal of the country that many people usually don't see. I enjoyed the places we stayed during the trip, which were ran by locals. The staff at each place was so welcoming and encouraged us to make the place home. And note, all the places were well kept and clean. Riding a camel into the Sahara and sleeping under the stars in the desert on our 3rd night was one of my favorite memories. Abdul our tour guide and driver really brought another dynamic to the trip by sharing his love and passion for his country. He told us about the areas we were visiting, the history, and the culture. He made us feel like we will always have a friend in Morocco. If you get a chance to request a guide, I highly recommend asking for Abdul."

We had a private driver and the camel trek was with a group. It's a long drive (7 hours to the desert from Fes and long drives the other days as well) but we thought they did a great job adding interesting stops and information along the way. The roads are windy and they drive fast, so be aware of that if that kind of thing bothers you. We loved our guide, seemed very knowledgeable, nice and helpful. One of the best parts was that our driver was open to things we were interested in specifically. We asked to see some fossils, which wasn't on the plan and he knew just where to go. We also made him aware that we were sick of eating tagine, and he made sure that our next stop had some other options (specifically, a place where we ordered lamb meat by the kilo, and ate it fresh off the grill)."

My solo 2 night 3 day tour from Marrakech to Erg Chebbi was the best voyage I've ever taken, mostly due to the superlative friendliness of my guide Abdellah. Over three days we shared many stories and many of the magnificent views over Morocco. Abdellah had a strong command of the road and I felt secure in his driving. He was also very accommodating, always willing to stop by the side of the road for me to check something out (note that I was on a private tour) or to buy ice-cream at a shop. The hotels and restaurants that we went to were clean, comfortable and catered to my vegetarianism. Finally, Erg Chebbi is by itself would have been worth the entire voyage to Morocco, even if I saw nothing else. I cannot have been more satisfied with my journey. I learned more from Abdellah than any other guide that I have encountered, and hope to get to go on another tour of Morocco soon."

Our guide, Abdullah, is the best guide I've ever encountered. He is not only knowledgeable (about everything from culture to politics to geography, you name it!), he shares information with us with so much passion and positivity. As a driver, I felt safe all the time in his car, even though there are roads and situations which can get messy (lots of one way roads with pedestrians and bikes and windy mountain roads). He also makes sure that we are comfortable, plan the day at our pace and is basically a joy to travel with.My favourite part of the tour was the night out in the dessert. Having lived in a city my whole life, that was my first camel ride and first time seeing a dessert. The food served in the dessert camp was crazy good! The entertainment also went on well late into the night. We slept outdoors under the stars and it was amazing. An experience I would remember for life.All in all, couldn't ask for a better tour operator (who was very accommodating and responsive) or a better guide."

My wife and I were very much looking forward to our 3 day/ 2 night tour from Marrakech to the Erg Chigaga, and this trip, with this company did not disappoint. Mohammed Fadil, our 4x4 driver, was absolutely amazing. He loved showing off the beauty of Morocco and filling us in on the wonderful history, geography, and flavor of his country. Let me break the trip down for you: A) It takes a long time to get there from Marrakech. Within the trip are little built in stops for food and recreation. Now, I guess we should have seen this coming but we didn't. Of course the restaurants were tourist traps, and the sights were places that all of the travel companies had deals with, but all in all they were very nice. We especially liked the small berber collective town where the famous green colored pottery and tile was made. In the end, it was a bit off-putting at first to be \"shown\" where to eat or what sights to see, but ultimately it is your choice to actually partake in these places. By the end of our journey we simply told Mohammed that we preferred not to stop and that was okay as well. B) The dunes and the desert camp were fantastic. We wished we could have stayed there a few more nights. The dinner and breakfast provided at the camp was more that adequate (beware, there is no water provided, bring LOTS), and the workers even woke us up at the crack of dawn (initially it sucked, but in the end totally worth it) so you can watch the sun rise over the dunes. C) Riding the camels was great, really great, but only lasted for about 70-90 minutes. Again, totally worth it, just know that going in. This whole experience from the company's customer service (we corresponded over many emails), to our driver Mohammed, the excursions, the camping tents, the camels themselves, the food, and the entirety of the scenery was just splendid. We definitely recommend this company and this tour."

After the drive we had an hour Camel ride. I was slightly concerned beforehand that the Camels may be mistreated in some way, but our Berber guide seemed to love them like a family member! The camp itself has great facilities and we slept surprisingly well. We woke for sunrise before heading back on the Camels. Would highly recommend this tour, I can certainly see why there are so many positive reviews."

If you want to experience Morocco firsthand, we definitely recommend a tour with this company and with Abdellah. On this tour, we learned about the culture and history of Morocco, several words in Berber and Arabic, and we also experienced so many landscapes from the city to the snow-capped mountains, dry mountains with lush green valleys, and the desert. We definitely recommend the 4 day tour instead of the 3 day because you'll spend much less time in the car, but the drive is just beautiful and you'll have many briefs stops along the way. We chose this trip because we figured it'd be more memorable to see the countryside and learn from a local, than to spend a couple more days in a touristic city and take the bus or train across Morocco for our return flight. If you're wondering was it worth ($) it?? It definitely was--and we are just several english teachers living abroad and a friend from back home that wanted to come along! These guys are professionals (several languages, legit paperwork, quick responses, friendly service, safe driving) and they want nothing more than to share their country with you. Our last advice, read through the entire trip itinerary and understand everywhere you want to go--don't get me wrong, their itinerary is great!--but if you'd rather spend more time walking around a village, then just ask--otherwise, sit back and relax and enjoy Morocco! Cheers! Tip: don't bother sandboarding, even if you're a spectacular snowboarder--you're feet will sit loosely in the bindings and you'll have no control."

We could have waited between 2 and 6 hours to see if the road would be open, but ask if there was any other tours we could instead. The Ouzoud Cascades & Waterfalls Day trip was suggested by our guide, so we did that instead.I have to be honest, it was not the best trip i have ever had, as it rained loads the previous night, so what we got was a brown waterfall, it was not very pretty ( i think it could look pretty amazing if the water was clear and clean). We walked to all the different points of the waterfall and after a while it got a bit boring for me. The guides was very informative, and what i did notice, was how poor the country actually is. I am from South Africa and we have some poor communities, but this was truly a 3rd world country.So if you want to experience the essence of Marroco, i would recommend you see and experience these trips.Thank you to the team at Authentic Tours, they handled our booking with ease and made the refund from our Zangora trip the same day. This is the best tour operator you could find in Marrakech."

The local guide we had was good, but a bit young I think so he sometimes went too far ahead and left my husband and I to catch up! I will write another review on the hike itself with some tips.We had lunch at the house of the local guide (60 DH extra per person) which was fresh beldi chicken tagine, mint tea, delicious fruits overlooking an amazing view of the valley and mountains - spectacular!great day out, enough time in the car and out. If you cannot do the hike, then I think you can still spend time in the valley- plenty of cafes.shops/restaurants and a beautiful walk along the stream - I would recommend for elderly or ill."

He was a friend showing us around his home land, taking us to his favourite places to eat and he even helped us haggle for a tajine in one of those side of the road shops so we wouldn't get ripped off at the Fna market!

We accidentally overpaid thinking the quoted price was per person, and instead it was the total price for the both of us (which was a great deal). Mohamed checked on the price, and gave us back the amount we overpaid. Another important note, while we did some shopping, we did not feel pressured to purchase or to shop in any particular place. I have been on a lot of tours over the years where the tour company has a relationship with a specific shop, and this did not happen here. Instead, I felt relaxed and had a really enjoyable experience meeting and dealing with local artisans.This was a great cultural and historical experience as well, as we had a traditional Berber meal, and learned a great deal about the ways of life surrounding the Ksars of A\u00eft Benhaddou. I highly recommend this tour company and particularly Mohamed JP as your guide!"

Jaouad in the office was extremely helpful throughout all of our email communications and answered our questions, no matter what time of day... He organised our trip with only two days noticed and everything was exactly as he had advised.Our driver, Amine, was very welcoming from the moment we met him and it was a pleasure to get to know him throughout the trip... He even let us put our music on in the car! The tour itself was such an experience! Visiting the ancient town of Ait Ben Haddou, Ouarzazate, the gorge and the Sahara camp. So many beautiful places to visit, even just driving past in the car! The hotel we stayed at on the first night was really great and the Sahara camp was unexpectedly comfortable. The camel ride to see the sunset and sunrise was definitely the highlight of the trip, especially as we had a full moon, which made it extra special. We met some other travellers that did a group tour before we went on ours and after talking to them we were so glad that we booked a private tour! Not once we did we feel rushed, or left in the dark about what was happening/where we were going and we felt comfortable to ask to stop whenever we wanted. Every where we went with Amine, we were welcomed with smiles... You can tell that He and Jaouad really love what they do. Thanks again for an unforgettable experience! We would definitely recommend booking with Authentic tours!"

He was great company. Definetely a must-do trip when in Morroco - the countryside, mountains, landscape, sights along the way (ait benhaddou, black canyon, draa valley, etc) are just superb.If we had more time in Morroco, we would have tried to make it to Merzouga (which requires 3D/2N), as we would have liked to see bigger sand dunes during the overnight desert stay, the dunes in Zagora are very small, but still a pleasure, if you are short of time."

As we had expressed interest in visiting Essaouir, Mohammad-JP & Fatima both made booking the trip a breeze. Mohammad-JP was a excellent driver & chaperone, setting up guides for us each day. Hassan in Ouzoud & Achmedc in Essaouir were both fantastic guides & had a vast knowledge of each of their locations. Again, Mohammad couldn't have done more. He stopped at the Argan Oil trees along the way to Ouzoud & even dropped in to where they produce Argan Oil products by hand. Also, making any stops you wished along the way; whether for pictures, coffee stops, bathroom breaks, etc.I couldn't recommend booking both of these trips with this company while staying in Marrakech enough. Good people & great memories. P.s. Tell Mohammad to get 'Big Iron' on while riding the long roads of Morocco."

The one that stood out and was horse heads ahead of the others was the Authentic Tour agency. It did not matter what time or day of the week whatever questions I had they got back to me right away. They picked us up from our hotel when they said they would and we paid what they said we would. There were no surprises what so ever. Our driver Omar was exceptional. He was very attentive, polite, professional, and flexible. The desert tour was long but always full of surprises just as you thought you were thinking you weren\u2019t going to see anything special you ran into something awesome. Omar made sure we saw what we wanted and helped us in every way he could. He gave us a full history and showed all the points of interest. All in all it was a fascinating trip.

The tour was blended to suit our needs and we felt that we spent a day with a friend more so than a day with a tour operator. An Essaouria tour provides a great respite from the heat, hassle and intensity of Marrakesch and is highly recommended. We suggest travellers do this early as Mohamed can provide great tips to avoid the pitfalls of being an ignorant traveller in Marrakesch. Our day with Mohamed and Affinity Tours was the highlight of our time in Morocco. Highly recommended."

Except one night on the dessert we spent two nights in stunning hotels-palaces surrounded by gorges, palms, with just royal service. Our driver ABDULLAH was an exceptional guide-driver and the agency should be really happy to have such a committed worker. He was fully professional, knowledgeable, and caring about our safety. You can see that he doesn't do his job only because it is his duty only he gets personal satisfaction from making people happy. I will recommend these tours among my family and friends as it is fully safe and enjoyable and I recommend these tours to you if you want to see real Morocco, become speechless with the beauty of this country and be assisted by supportive and professional guide-driver, like Abdullah.

The service was very professional. The driver had arrived very early to ensure a quick and early start to our journey. All the stops we had were amazing with very good explanations from the guide for any attractions we had visited or any questions we had. As for the programme of the tour I will not repeat it as it is explained in a lot of detail on the tour operator's website (http://www.authentic-tours-marrakech.com/marrakech-tours/2-days-marrakech-zagora-desert-tour.html). However in addition to the tour description our guide also took as to a berber family were we had traditional cous-cous for lunch, which was very tasty. Although it is a bit tiring due to the long distances travelled, it is totally worth it. My friends and I do not regret booking this tour as it was a breathtaking experience, especially seeing the sunset and sunrise in the desert. If you are pushed for time this is the ideal tour. We only had 5 days and we believe that if we did not take this tour we would not have felt complete about visiting Morocco. Overall an excellent experience and worth the money and therefore would like to thank both Fatima and Mohamed for their help and services"

The car was a large, comfortable SUV with plenty of room and good air con (essential in the summer heat).As we drove through the beautiful countryside and up to the Atlas mountains Mohamed was great at stopping for our photos whenever, as well as recommending good spots and ones we could go back to when they were less busy the next day. We stopped at Ouarzazate to explore the beautiful city known for many films (and Astapor in Game of Thrones!) And got a tour from a friendly local who even welcomed us into his home for tea. Take money for tips and souvenirs as you will want to spend a lot on both, we got some beautiful paintings for only 150 dirham.Then we drove on to Zagora where we climbed on camels to walk to the Berber camp. This was amazing, especially being on a private tour so it was only the two of us and we arrived for the sunset on the mountains.The camp was lovely, very comfortable and welcoming, with soft beds, delicious food and fun songs all night. They wake you up to watch the sunrise as well! Then we were back on our camels and soon in the car.The second day we were so tired so slept a lot but Mohamed was so kind and kept quiet for us. At our request he dropped us at a beautiful Riad for a few hours to eat a lavish lunch and splash in the pool which you should definitely do if you can!Finally we drove back to Marrakech and we were sad to say goodbye!

We have friends who had been there about 6 months previously and they recommended Authentic Tours. I'm so glad they did! Some other friends of ours were somewhat paralleling our agenda, with a different tour company and their experience wasn't as great as ours. Our guide, Amine, is very knowledgeable about Morocco and clearly loves his country. He was always willing to stray (a little) from the agenda, as our moods dictated. We customized an agenda with Jaouad and the main office, and they were very easy to work with and very accommodating. Our schedule was Amine picked us up in Marrakech, then we drove through the mountains to Ouarzazate, making stops in a casbah and at Ait Benhaddou. The next day, we drove through the Todra Gorges, then out to Erg Chebbi for the camel ride into the desert, where we spent the night in tents. From there, after riding the camels back out, we drove to Fez, stopping at a forest to see monkeys in the wild (I actually saw one!). The original plan was for Amine to leave us in Fez and after a couple of days there, we'd take a train to Casablanca. Part-way through the trip, we decided we wanted to extend our time with Amine in Fez so that he could drive us to the airport in Casablanca, as well as show us more sights on the way. Again, no problem getting this taken care of through their office, and through Amine's great generosity with his time! Another essential thing in Fez, Authentic Tours arranged a guide to walk us through the maze of souks, something we couldn't have done without a guide. We never felt like we had to rush along or that we didn't get as much time as we would have liked at particular sites. The highlight of the trip was the camel trek! 90 minutes, through a sandstorm to an oasis camp, then up before sunrise the next morning to see the sunrise over the desert. I can't recommend Authentic Tours Marrakech highly enough!"

The communication from the start till the end was of top level and we never felt insecure regarding what was agreed. Our driver/guide, Mohamed JP, picked us up promptly at the beginning of the trip from our Hotel and briefed us on what we would do during this 2 day trip. He was AMAZING. Really friendly and willing to frequently stop for photos. He knew what he was doing and we always followed his advice. The overnight at the tents was absolutely great and left us with plenty of lovely memories and images. I would definitely recommend Authentic Tours and there are no words to express our gratitude for this experience to our fantastic guide Mohamed JP ;D"

            "review": "I recommend to you, this tour. We booked the tour from Marrakech to Fes, and asked if we could end the tour at Chaouen instead. Jaouad, the tour guy, said yes. He was very quick in replying, and answered a lot of my questions.We met Mohamed at the airport, and the tour started. He was friendly and welcoming. As we drove through the streets of Marrakech, we started to get to know each other and he told us about Morocco, some history (which I liked) and answered questions we had about the country we just stepped into. Thinking I would try to bargain in another language other than English or French, he taught me how to count in Darija, which I only ended up using when he asked me if I still remembered it. The same day we went through the High Atlas mountains, stopped to see A\u00eft Benhaddou, and finally ended in Ouarzazate, where we stayed in a lovely, quiet riad.The next day we went to the Toudgha gorges, on our way to Merzouga. Before going on the camel ride to the tents, Mohamed gave each of us a big bottle of water which was really thoughtful (thanks again, man). The camel ride itself wasn't comfortable, but the view was spectacular. When night fell, it was even more beautiful. The moon bathed the desert with its glow, with stars all around it. Then there was me, lying down, on the desert, alone with my thoughts, and music through my ears. This would have been perfect if not for the wind which was picking up that night, sweeping sand over my face and getting it into my mouth. It still was cool, though. This was definitely the highlight of the tour. I mean the stars. Not the sand in my mouth.On the last day of the tour, we rode through the mountains filled with snow, saw some monkeys and passed through Ifrane, which was very different compared to the other places which we have visited. After stopping at Fes for a short break, we headed to Chaouen. Mohamed, who drove all day, kept his concentration and got us safely to that beautiful town in the north. We arrived at night, and he took us to a nice restaurant, Beldi Bab Ssour. The food was really good and affordable, and the staff were really friendly. We ended up going there three times.If you\u2019re going to Morocco and really want to take in the view, sit next to the driver.And yes, this was worth the money."

All arrangements worked really well - all booked by email and all arrangements were on time and went smoothly. A really easy company to deal with.We had a fantastic time - and it was made really special by our fantastic guide/driver Abdullah. Abdullah was a very careful driver and we always felt very safe with him. He spoke excellent English. He was very knowledgeable about Morocco and talked to us about everything from the culture, to the economics, trade, politics, history etc. He was also good fun and had a great sense of humour. He was great with the children too. A very big thank you to Abdullah for a very special trip that will stay in our memories forever. We really enjoyed the trip over the Atlas Mountains and the views and scenery were spectacular. We enjoyed the visit to Ait Benhaddou and had a lovely lunch at a Ryad there. (we wished we had taken swimsuits for the kids as they could have used the pool - but they had fun just paddling anyway!)The camel trek and night in the Bedouin camp was truly memorable. The camels were very well behaved - but the ride took a bit of getting used to! A fantastic once in a lifetime experience. The camp has every comfort including solar powered electric lights in the tents and an electricity socket! However, it still feels genuine and gave a a flavour of the culture whilst being comfortable enough for the children (ages 14, 10 and 5) The camp helpers were all great and really helpful. The traditional meal was very nice and there was certainly plenty of food. Breakfast was again plentiful and lots of choice.We had a great trip back and enjoyed the movie studios in Quarzazate (seeing where Cleopatra, Ben Hur, Gladiator and Games of Thrones were filmed) and then had a good lunch there.All in all it was a fantastic trip and we had the best time. Thank you to Authentic Tours (and thanks to Abdullah) very much."

Along the way to Zagora and back he was stopping every now and then for photo shoots, coffee and tea. He never brought us to any overpriced places and he was always concerned about our well being. The berber camp next to Zagora was well organized. Every tent had one double and one single bed with sheets and blankets. Part of the camp was a big tent with modern toilets and hot water showers. I recommend this trip to everyone who doesn't have enough time. If you have more time on the other hand, from what I heard Merzouga is a real desert expirience."

When we had problems with the bank machine he immediately offered to loan us his own money. The hotels (Chez Pierre and Dar Chanaa) were of high quality and our night in the desert tent was actually quite comfortable. The tents were made of carpet-type material and were very warm. The washrooms were of the chemical toilet type and very clean. We had a delicious dinner in the desert, vegetable soup, chicken tagine, and sliced oranges. The camel trek was somewhat uncomfortable, but the desert scenery was worth experiencing. Authentic tours were prompt and efficient to deal with, and the SUV used for the tour was new and comfortable."

We got underway in a lovely 4x4, until our road through the mountains was shut as there had been too much rainfall and the way was too dangerous. Brahim offered us two alternatives - we could go to a fishing village for the day or go to see some waterfalls. We chose the latter, and by the time we arrived at the waterfalls (which were spectacular and torrential with the rainfall!) he had arranged a private tour guide for free, lunch and 10 euros off the cost for the change of tour, even though it was completely unavoidable.I would not recommend going to the waterfalls without a guide, we were taken to all sorts of little places, including to see some wild monkeys. He took pictures for us and took us the safe route (some other guides were going on paths which looked way too steep!). We also chatted a lot about Moroccan customs and way of life, we just had a brilliant time. Lunch was at a great little restaurant, and even though it was a cold day they seated us near the fire for extra warmth. We had bread, olives, water, soup, tagines, fruit and mint tea for a set price of 100 dirhams, about \u00a37 I think. The staff were running round keeping everyone happy and still smiling!I would definitely recommend this company, they made a real effort to save our day for us and we had a great time. Also communication beforehand was excellent."

            "review": "Customized Six Day Tour \u2013 A Great Adventure!. When we started making our plans to visit Morocco, (9 months before our trip,) like everyone we read numerous articles and TripAdvisor reviews of tour agencies. There are so many of them to choose from! It can be like throwing darts. Fortunately we were right on the bull\u2019s-eye when we choose Authentic Tours Marrakech (ATM). They proved themselves to be professional and reliable from the first prompt emails with Hasna. Messages flew back and forth with lots of questions and answers. Finally we agreed on a semi-customized six day tour that started in Essaouira (we stayed there 3 days before the start of the trip) and ended in Chefchaouen, via Meknes. After seven days in Chefchaouen and Fez on our own, we used ATM again for the transfer from Fez to Marrakech and later for a day tour of the Marrakech medina. We had a wonderful adventure with Omar Ait Khouya as our driver and guide. Always friendly, upbeat and concerned for our well-being, he enthusiastically shared his knowledge of his beloved country and family. He graciously answered every one of our questions, and really helped us to understand the history of the places we visited. He was always willing to stop for photo opportunities, which was very much appreciated, because I\u2019m sure it made his days longer than usual. Omar was conscientious about wearing seat-belts, never exceeded the speed limit and was a very skilled driver. He took us through snow-covered mountain passes, flooded roadbeds, and incredibly tight city streets, without ever losing his temper or his control of the vehicle. After two harrowing Grand Taxi experiences (on our own), safe driving is really valued. We thoroughly enjoyed his company and could not imagine our Moroccan experience without him.Everything was first-class with ATM, starting with the new Toyota Land Cruiser we used to cross snowy mountains, riverbeds and deserts. All the hotel options were wonderful. Kasbah Tebi in Ait Benhaddou has no electricity so all the rooms and stairways are lit by candles, and there was a stork\u2019s nest right above our room (a good omen for our trip.) The stars in the night sky were so brilliant you could see the Milky Way. This was one of the highlights of our trip, along with the camel ride from Auberge Du Sud into the Sahara and having breakfast for two served in the sand dunes just outside camp. The cave hotel, Auberge Festival in the gorges, was also excellent and very enjoyable. In hindsight, we should have done a few things differently. The ride from Essaouira to Ait Benhaddou was too long (this was at our request) and I would suggest starting from Marrakech so you can really enjoy the old caravan route. Essaouira is very nice and deserves more than a day trip from Marrakech though.We only stayed in Meknes one night, but should have stayed two in order to have had a full day to explore that interesting city. Again this was at our request.We thought our customized tour was very well priced and an extremely good value now with the lower dollar/euro exchange rates. We like to linger when we travel and this tour worked very well for us. It was cold traveling in mid-January (from 70F to the low 30\u2019s), but much less crowded, which was very nice. Be prepared: bring thermals, gloves and a hat, and wear layers. A head lamp and toilet paper will also come in handy for camping in the desert and at Kasbah Tebi. (Ladies, check out Urinelle funnels. They are very useful when you encounter a Turkish toilet.)On day two we stopped on the road to take photos of nomadic shepherds in the gorges, who were far away across a dry riverbed. Moments later several young children had run down to our SUV. The oldest did not ask for sweets or money. \u201cDo you have any clothes or shoes for children?\u201d he asked. Unfortunately, we did not. Just an idea, maybe take along a small bag of clothes and shoes to leave behind."

The package also includes a stop at a cooperative where they create argon oil and other argon-related products.I highly recommend this tour to anyone who will be in Marrakech and who wants to check out Essaouria. Our driver was very friendly and offered to help us out in other ways - he offered to stop by the train station so we could buy the tickets we would need the following day and offering to stop so we could buy a melon from a farmer selling them on the side of the highway. I strongly recommend that you not buy much at the Argon oil cooperative he takes you to because we were disappointed to find much better prices for argon oil when we arrived at Essarouia but unfortunately we had already spent over $100 on argon products by this point."

My friend and I did a trip with Omar to A\u00eft Benhaddou today, and we had the most spectacular experience - perhaps the best day of our Moroccan experience so far (and we've been here for two weeks)! Our guide went above and beyond what was expected of him, and at the end of our 10 hour day trip, when we were all tired, he stopped to buy us prickly pears (on him) from a vendor because he felt guilty that his energy was wearing thin. Contrarily, we found him wonderfully insightful and energetic all the way through, despite it being Ramadan and, in quite warm weather, he'd refrained from eating and drinking all day without a single complaint.He bought us water too, and we saw parts of the countryside and sights we would not have otherwise had opportunity to see, all of which were so picturesque and rich in history. A truly unbelievable experience, riding in style in an SUV with moroccan carpets beneath our feet, eating a delicious lunch at a restaurant after our tour of the incredible town where various films have been shot, and all for a more than reasonable price. The rolling hills, the desert, the kasbahs, the afternoon mint tea - it is a royal Moroccan experience in and of itself, and with a guide as friendly, warm, and welcoming as Omar, we highly recommend this trip.Thank you for a day to remember and cherish!"

Once our trek was over, Mohammed met back up with us and we started back to Marrakech. We had mentioned we'd like to ride a camel, so he went out of his way to the Palmerie area and arranged a short ride for the two of us at an incredible price. Hassan and Mohammed went above and beyond to make our experience truly unforgettable! Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!"

(They gave me a discount because I booked two tours.) I found them on the Internet. Emails were answered promptly and the booking was problem-free with payment via PayPal. There was no pressure on either of the tours to purchase carpets or any other souvenirs.The first tour was to Essaouira with a stop an an argan oil cooperative at my suggestion. My driver, Ibrahim, picked me up at my hotel. He was a good driver, very pleasant and helpful. I can definitely recommend him. I was dropped off and picked up at a central, convenient place in Essaouira and the trip was hassle free. All I had to do was enjoy myself.The second tour was to Telouet and Ait Benhaddou. The driver for this tour, Mohammed Fadli, also picked me up at my hotel. The road was a curvy mountain road, but he was a competent driver. We visited both of the Kasbahs and because I was alone, a lunch was arranged as part of the tour. Mohammed was very pleasant and friendly and I was impressed at how friendly he was towards all the Moroccans we came in contact with. I can definitely recommend him also and would not hesitate to book another tour with this company."

The pick ups and drop offs in a top quality well maintained 4x4 were precise and punctual. Our guide and driver, Amine, made our trips so memorable, and I would go further in suggesting that having a guy as clearly focused, sharp and globally astute on board as he is must be a massive asset to Authentic Tours.

It is hard not to fall in love with the people and the sheer beauty of the country. With that being said, I do highly recommend emplying the services of a guide and driver if you are planning to venture outside of Marrakech or any of the major cities. Since this was our first visit to Morocco, we decided to accomplish two main goals - explore the magical city of Marrakech and then to head to the Erg Chebbi dunes for the surreal (albeit a bit cliche) experience of a camel trek into the Sahara. Enter Authentic Tours Marrakech...I have used private guides in other countries (China, Greece, etc.), however, this agency exceeded all prior experiences. The reason was solely our guide--Ahmed--and driver--Abdul. They were both energetic, knowledgeable, and catered to our every need. We engaged in talks about politics, the arts, and everyday life in our own respective homes. They shared every bit of insight that they had at each stop. One of the big issues that these tours face is that they all have required vendors that they want to stop at to try and get the tourists to spend money on whatever item they are selling--since the agency/guides get a cut. Not once did I feel obligated to buy anything. In fact, when we wanted to buy a traditional Berber wrap for our camel trek, they took us to a small family's shop that had prices that were 1/3rd of the tourist trap locations. AFTER buying the wraps for approximately $4 each, they told us that the kids running around the shop were all orphans from nearby villages. A typical tour company would have softened us up with that news BEFORE we entered the shop. Regarding the sites...they were as advertised and wonderful. The camel trek delivered in a big way. I highly recommend this experience--it is surreal to be surrounded by the beautiful dunes and sitting atop a camel. My negative comment is that that lunch stops are definitely \"safe\" choices. I get that not every tourist loves Moroccan food--however, the lunch restaurants were quite bland and geared towards not causing digestive issues with little ol' blue-haired grandmas visiting from Florida. I would have loved to have a bit more adventurous culinary choices--but I just saved those for our nights in Marrakech. Overall, my final recommendation is to request AHMED and ABDUL as your guide and driver...they are wonderful!"

We enjoyed seeing the co-ops but at times we felt awkward because we weren't sure if we were obliged to buy something.

We met Othman who took us from Casablanca to Marrakech, he was just on time with a ford van car, comfortable and with wifi all through our way, we choose to go to the three valleys high Atlas Mountains , during the trip we stopped by one of the barbarian houses and passed by setty fatma to have lunch by the river, the place is outstanding beauty, othman was our tour guide and a true friend to us, we talked and were given nice info about the place (this trip is highly recommended in Marrakech) the day after we went to essaoura city, we stopped to photograph the goats climbing the argan trees and then we reached the city and made a walk around the harbor and othman recommended a nice restaurant serving delicious seafood Othman surprised us with morrocan delights as a gift before we were leaving I am so happy meeting such a nice true friend thank you for making our trip so unforgettable"

We met and were impressed by other members of the team - Khalid and Soufiane who met and returned us to the airport and went out of their way to help us with problems we had with an airport cash machine - but our trip into the High Atlas with Othman was the highlight of our week in Marrakech. He is a warm, engaging person and we found him excellent company. Our trip covered three valleys and took us above the snow-line in this extraordinary landscape with a huge lake, rivers and cascades, castles and mud brick villages. We especially enjoyed the insights we were given into the lives of country folk and loved visiting the Saturday market for local people at Asti, and a traditional Berber house and mill in the Ourika Valley equipped, furnished and inhabited as it has been for generations. We were also introduced to Abdelmajid at the Arom Mantagne Herb Garden who gave us an entertaining and instructive tour showing how Argan oil was produced and the many cosmetic and medicinal uses of herbs and plants grown there. It was fascinating to learn just how ancient and resourceful Berber people are and to see how they adapt to modern life while retaining their distinctive culture and identity. They and Othman with his own Berber roots earned our respect and gratitude for their warm welcome, courteous hospitality and willingness to share whatever they could with us. We very much look forward to a return visit so that Othman can take us on a 4-day safari into the desert. He has given us a unique experience we shall always value and never forget."

My husband and I did a week-long tour around a large portion of Morocco. Ali was very responsive and willing to create a customized itinerary for us, including picking us up at the airport. The price was very reasonable and the experience exceeded our expectations in all aspects. Mohammed was a terrific driver and guide. He gave us great recommendations for food and took us to interesting locations. He made sure to stop if we wanted to take photos, go to the restroom, or get something to eat. He is friendly and very knowledgeable. We learned so much about culture, religion, and history in Morocco and Mohammed was happy to participate in an exchange of perspectives. The overnight trip in the desert was one that had been on my bucket list, and the experience was truly incredible (although camels aren't very comfy to ride and I wouldn't recommend going any longer than a couple of hours on a camel). I especially loved meeting Mohammed's family and sharing food and tea with them. My husband and I have traveled a lot, usually by ourselves, but this tour was by far one of our favorite travel experiences. My husband had been a little nervous about visiting Morocco because he didn't really know what to expect, and he ended up loving it largely due to Mohammed making us feel so comfortable and well-informed."

We booked 6 nights (3 in Marrakech and 3 going to and returning to desert)The desert portion we did firstOur guide for the desert portion was Mustapha he was amazing!!! The teenagers thought so highly of him- us adults thought he looked after us and every need he anticipated. The camel trek into the Sahara was undeniably surreal - again Mustapha personally made sure everything was looked after other people on our Sahara trek did not have a personal guide solely anticipating our needs and making sure we were happy. These three nights unbelievable book this tour FOR SUREThe hiccups came upon our return to Marrakech - this may be the loss of Mustapha as he is a desert tour guide and a let down after the camel highlightBut the accommodations in Marrakech which were suppose to be luxurious had problems - yes they moved us in rooms on 3 occasions in 1 night ( no air con, toilet broken etc) not camel safaris fault and they even offered to move to a different hotel but overall the next nights in Marrakech drastically paled in comparison to the first 3. The city tour quite frankly boring, we needed recommendations or help for dinner and basically relied on trip advisor....Overall the company was very good but the riad Bahia Salam (think boutique hotel) in Marrakech notHowever Mustapha and the first 3 nights AMAZING!!!!Do this trip do this company and definitely request Mustapha"

Generous in sharing his knowledge, his culture and his passion for the Berber culture and music. Yet, Khalid knew how to respect my moments of silence. A careful driver, the kind you can take a quick nap in the car with no concerns.

Short version of our trip...book it, request Mustapha, enjoy and make many memories. The long version follows:My first point of contact was Ali through the company email. He always responded quickly and answered all of my questions. Since we (married couple in our 50\u2019s) had never visited Morocco or used a private guide, we had lots of questions. I\u2019m sure Ali was sitting back thinking \u201cmake this stop\u201d, but he was great. \uf04a At first I thought the price was a little on the high side, but once we finished our trip, we felt like it was more than worth it! We did the two nights, three day private trip Marrakech to Marrakech. We were met right on time at our riad in Marrakech by Mustapha. He has a great personality and speaks English very well. Throughout the trip he gave us information regarding the area, the customs and lifestyle of the various regions and even shared information about himself and his family. There are designated stops, but you are also welcome to ask to stop to see something that interest you along the way. At every stop, both Mustapha and the driver were there to open and close our car doors...gentlemen!Each time there was a view or site that took our breath way, we didn\u2019t think it could be topped...until the next stop. Our trip through the Atlas Mountains was unbelievable. We made many stops along the way to the Sahara. We paid a little more to have a couple of extras with no regrets. Our stop for the night at Dades was at the Kasbah Xhaloca. We usually stay at mom and pop type of places, but wow, this was amazing. Once we arrived at the Sahara dunes, we were able to relax before our trip into the desert for the night. The camels were an adventure of their own traveling the dunes! I don\u2019t know that I have ever experienced a more serene trip, it was so quiet and beautiful. Two guides led us and a few others to our bivouac where Berber tents were already set up. The food, music and company were excellent. It was a really hot night and we pulled out mattress out into the sand for the night. The next morning we rode the camels back to meet Mustapha and our driver for the long trip back to Marrakech. Although it was a long ride, we still made a few stops and Mustapha was a true guide to the end."

Mustapha spoke excellent English and nothing was too much trouble.We did a four day trip, with hindsight, if you're only in Morocco for a week, the 3 day trip would be long enough.The whole trip was fantastic, the valleys, the scenery, the Kasbah's and the desert were all amazing. Morocco has a little bit of something for everyone. My favourite was definitely the desert, it was beautiful with sand so soft, I was in raptures which coming from someone who says they hate sand is something! What made the desert was the sunrise. Hats off to Mustapha who was the only guide to get us up early enough to climb the dunes to watch the sunrise, it was special, up there alone in the beauty of the sunrise. Thank you Mustapha for adding that special moment to our trip.Thank you Ali at Camel Safaris for arranging our trip and an even bigger thanks for Mustapha and Hassan, our fabulous guide and driver.

Our tour guide Khalid was very professional and knowledgeable. I arrived in Marrakesh the night before the tour but unfortunately my luggage did not arrive. I was worried and thought my only option was to stay in Marrakesh and miss the desert tour. Camel Safari tours was so kind to offer me the option to head out with a separate driver later on in the day after my luggage had arrived. I was so thrilled because I really did not want to miss the desert tour. Book with Camel Safari, they are simply the best!!!"

I reached out to him once arriving in Marrakech to book our trip leaving in a couple days. Ali was quick in responding and customizing our travel as we were not coming back to Marrakech after the desert safari. Our guide, Anas, arrived at our riad on time for our 3 day, 2 night trip. He was very knowledegable and also answered many of our questions along the way:) Given that we were going from Marrakech to Fes over the course of our trip, the drive during the days was long, however, the time went by quickly as we had great laughs and did mini excursions along the way. Our first night, we stayed at Chez Pierre in the Dades Valley. Definitely one of the highlights of the trip due to their attention to customer service and ensuring a great experience for their guests. (I highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in the area!). The following day, we made our way to Erg Chebbi for our camel safari. We made it to the camp just in time to watch the sunset on the sand dunes, followed by dinner under the stars. By far the best experience on the trip...next to waking up the following morning watching the sunrise over the Sahara! The entire trip couldn't have gone any better and was well organized by Camel Safaries. Anas, our guide, was also very accommodating. We were to end our trip in Fes and then make our way to Casablanca the following day. Anas looked into it and was able to drive us there himself. He took great care of us and we had such a great experience as a result. He felt like a part of our group and the trip would not have been the same without him.I would highly recommend Anas and Camel Safaries team. They definitely made our trip a memorable one!"

We felt like we took at chance booking this tour as it was cheaper than most we had looked at for camping/mountains/camels but it was a good decision.A lot of time is spent in the car travelling to different places but not really an issue as you get to see a lot. You stop at many different places along the way so you can get a good look at the land. Our guide was very knowledgeable of Morocco and answered all of my (many) questions regarding the history, the people and the landscape.First night you slept at an absolutely amazing Riad on a hillside. The second night you the ride the camel to the large canvas tents within the dunes but we ended up just sleeping outside on the dune under the stars (after watching desert foxes by torch light - beautiful experience).Our guide was Mustapha who was absolutely brilliant! Our driver was Hasan who was also great fun. Both genuinely nice men.This tour would be great to do solo, as a couple or with family or friends. But would not recommend with young children as the driving stints can be long (all day) and I'd imagine they'd be really bored/tired."

Although the drive is quite long (be prepared to be in the car for 7+ hours), but it's totally worth it.Our guide, Mustapha, spoke fluent English and kept us entertained the entire time. We made a few stops along the way, visited unique sites and had lots of mint tea (yum!). He and our driver took great care of us. We loved talking with Mustapha about life in Morocco and the culture. We left the trip feeling like we made a new friend. He took good care to ensure we were comfortable at all times and that we got the most out of the tour.The experience once we got to dessert was something that we will remember forever. We rode camels out to our camp (mine coincidentally had the same name as my dog!). We ended up being the only visitors in the camp so we were very spoiled. The camp had comfortable tents with beds and even a bathroom with showers and toilets. I never felt like we were \"roughing it.\" Even the food was delicious! Mustapha gave us the option to get up early to catch the sunrise, which we did. Stunning! It's a once in a lifetime experience to watch the sunrise over the dunes of the dessert with camels in the background.I would recommend this tour for anyone. It's definitely an experience that shouldn't be missed!"

Visitng the Sahara, riding camels, sleeping in tents in the middle of the desert, enjoying their traditional food, playing music with the locals, made this experience unique. The people were incredibly friendly, and we could really experience their culture.Beyond all that, just spending the late hours, in the desert looking at the stars (pretty impressive, because of the low light polusion), and having a chat with the people was also very special. If you go to Morocco, in my point of view, this is THE \"must do\"!"

The result: Amazing experience, unforgettable moments, cool pictures and the best, the opportunity to get to know the culture from the locals!! Normally I am sceptic when I book something online without a reference from someone I know, but I must say this tour was beyond our expectations: price, flexibility, punctuality, organization, hospitlity...all you could have asked for!We traveled 8 days from Fez down to Marrakesh, going through the Sahara Desert (wich for me was the best part of the trip for) and including the beach part, Essaouira, where we were lucky to enjoy the Gnoua Music Festival. These guys really do an awesome job. Everything was perfectly organized, the accomodation were veryyyy nice, clean and autenthic, the tours in the cities gave us an insight about the relegion, the history and the culture, the food was delicious and our driver, Anas, was the most friendly and nice person ever! He became part of our group!!! We saw many things in these 8 days and got a real taste of the hospitality and wonders of Morocco. We even had some cooking and traditional dancing classever I will definetely come back to Morocco and I can only recommend cammel safaries. You don't have to worry about ANYTHING and they really make your trip according to your interests, budget and time. "

Over all, the trip is well organised. All the stops we have made, they all have clean toilet and clean food. Before we have booked, we didn't realise how long it takes to go to Zagora. It is about 7 hours drive with 1 hour rest. The slight is amazing on the way tho! The atlas mountain is so beautiful, and full of colours. Our driver/guide is lovely, but he speaks only a bit English. I won't have minded, if when I first contact, they have promised to send a English speaking guide. The guide is also a bit ill (cold, I think) on the way there, and got worse (coughing) on the way back. We both have felt ill on the 2nd day back from the trip. It is just not very nice to be ill on holiday. It would be better if they didn't send someone who is unwell on the job. It's just that you spend 16 hours in the same car, it is difficult to avoid to it."

First of all Ali was extremely helpful and timely in his answers to our inquiry mails. Our guide came picking us up at our hotel in Marrakech, and the journey begun through different landscapes (the atlas, canyons, rocky desert and dunes desert). The stops were well placed and the hotels chosen very good (even in the cheapest version of the tour). Our guide was young but very Nice and I want to thank him (Mubarak) for all the explications, the help and the stories he told us. The experience to spend the night in the desert it's amazing. Don't worry the \"tent\" are very good with a real bed inside so you don't need to bring enything to feel confortable. Only thing the last day of the tour is a lot of driving so if you have the possibility I advice to make the 4 days tour that makes the going back easier.All in all an incredible experience (even if a little bit expensive) but worth to do at least once in a lifetime."

We paid 310 euros per person for a mid level accommodations. There was an option for budget accommodations for 280 euros per person as well. 1st day: Mohammed, our driver and guide, picked us up at our Riad at 8am. We went to the Atlas Mountains, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of A\u00eft Benhaddou (site of movies) , and Rose valley. Most of the stops were just a 3-5 min stop where we would take some pictures of the background. It would've been nicer if Mohammed would explain a little bit of the significance of each stop so we can appreciate the scenery a little more. Overnight, we stayed at a very nice hotel with dinner included. 2nd day: We went to the Todra Gorge and we were able to trek along the Gorge for around half an hour. It was a very nice hike with wonderful views of the gorge. Afterwards, we went to some fossil museum and other little shops. Around 3pm, we arrived at the hotel where we would take the camel trek. The highlight of the whole trip was taking the camel trek to the dessert and sleeping in the tent overnight. 3rd day: The last day is pretty much a car drive all the way back to Marrakech. It was a 10-11 hour drive straight with pit stops for washroom stops/lunch break. Pro: The whole trip was worth it for just for the camel trek, sand dunes and sleeping in the dessert. Everything else was just bonus.Con: A LOT of driving. 3rd day was pretty much all driving. Be prepared for that. Wish the guide/driver Mohammed would've came out of the car at the stops and explained the sites a little more."

As a solo female traveler, I felt more than comfortable, and I would recommend this tour to anyone who is travelling to Morocco (whether you are alone or with friends). I learned a ton about local Moroccan cultures and customs as well as fun facts, jokes and proverbs. The trip was evenly paced in that driving periods were not too long and breaks were just the right amount of time to stretch and see some sights. The first day involved going through the High Atlas mountains, visiting the Ait Benhaddou kasbah, learning history and posting up at a guest house in the Dades Valley. The guest house was fantastic. Great food, awesome views, friendly staff. The second day involved visiting the Todra Gorges and driving through some of the most remarkable mountain and desert settings on our way to the Erg Chebbi dunes. The camel ride was so fun, and the sunset and sunrise from the dunes were gorgeous. The camp was more like \"glamping\", which was a pleasant surprise. We had dinner in the camp, but breakfast was at the Kasbah Mohayut (where we launched the camel trek from). The staff is very friendly there, and the food was delicious. The third day was all about driving back to Marrakech and stopping along the way to see beautiful oasis scenes.  This tour was life-changing, and it made me want to stay in Morocco for a longer trip. I can't thank Mohammed enough for being the best guide and friend. I will be back, and I'm happy to call Morocco one of my favorite places in the world. If you're wondering whether or not you should go on this tour, do it. Absolutely do it. You'll be grateful you did."

Fantastic landscapes, people, regardless of the circumstances in which perhaps the majority of them live in - are open, positive and pleasant.Picnic in the Sahara desert, camel safari and night in the Sahara desert under the stars, off-road trip in the Atlas mountains, meeting with nomads and so much else. Each city, which we has seen its path with its charm, all of them are well worth seeing and unforgettable. Each accommodation where we stayed during our trip is noteworthy. My advice is to use these small Riads, rather than look for classic hotels. If you want to feel flavors of Morocco you have to try night at small and nice riad (for example in Marrakech we spent the night at riad de I\u2019Orientale - a charming place).And of course, if we are talking about Morocco, we have to talk about Moroccan cuisine - tagines, taktouka, fruits, olives, dates, fantastic sweets, ooo, I enjoyed every of them!Our trip was so opulent impressions and emotions that I still live in these emotions although I\u2019m already away from Morocco.

I did a LOT of research for this trip and based on reviews, we went with Camel Safaris. It was one of the best choices we made in planning our trip to Morocco. Fair prices and excellent communication with Ali. Mohammad, our guide, was nothing short of perfect! He was very friendly, kind, helpful, fun, knowledgeable, and easy to talk to. On Day 1 he picked us up @8am from our riad and spent the day driving and sightseeing along the way. He would stop anytime we asked for photos or otherwise. We toured Ben Ait Haddou (amazing!) - Mohammad gave us an introduction and then let us explore on our own. It was very interesting to drive through many small towns and stop to observe a few Berber villages, all while Mohammad gave us information and answered all of our questions. We stayed at Riad Itran that night, and wow!! was it fantastic! It was our favorite accommodation during our entire trip around Morocco. Beautiful location, charming riad, warm and friendly staff and delicious food. Day 2 we continued our drive through oases and palmeries and a second kasbah that is setup as a museum.We arrived to our camels where we met our guides and camels. We trekked in before sunset. Yes, it was about as cool as you could imagine. The kids played on the dunes until dark when we were served a delicious tagine dinner and mint tea. The camp in a permanent site with individual pods with actual beds and electricity in them. We were not expecting that! It was very cold that night but with 5 blankets, we were very warm. We played drums around the fire that night and watched what little stars we could since it was cloudy :( The next morning we climbed up the dunes to watch the sunrise before packing up and heading back out. The camel ride was only about 1 hour each way. I would have liked it to be a little longer. The camp itself is on the edge of the Sahara really - you could see the town in the distance when looking west. On our return drive we had to pass through the snowy Atlas Mts - the Berber villages we saw on Day 1 were covered in snow! Luckily the roads had been cleared enough to let us through. We returned to Marrakesh about 8pm that evening. Amazing and well organized trip. I highly recommend this company to anyone!!!"

An absolutely amazing experience, filled with cultural and exciting experiences. Going out into the desert was what we were there for but having lunch with a nomad family and playing football with the kids was a spectacular experienced. Our guide was Mohammed and he was absolutely amazing. Best guide I have had on any trip, and I have travelled a lot. Knowledgable, open, fun and very interesting to talk to. He was also really good with me when I got sick and even posted my camera to me when I left it in the car!Highly recommend for everyone."

            "review": "Unforgettable, incredible tour. This was an amazing trip - and one I'll not soon forget. I was traveling alone, and Mohammed was my guide. He met me at the riad I had stayed at in Marrakech, and we set off on our journey from there. Mohammed made me feel comfortable immediately. We became fast friends as the first day was about 4 hours in the car, driving along the winding roads that climb through the beautiful Atlas Mountains and through a number of small towns. The sights along the way were amazing - gorgeous mountains, the kasbah at Ait-Ben-Haddou, the dwellings made of mud and clay, grazing goats and more. I could have taken thousands of pictures and felt it wasn't enough! Mohammed is a knowledgeable guide, and I fear I didn't ask enough questions of him, as we were having too much fun swapping stories about our lives. A highlight of this first day was when we stopped so I could take pictures of a herd of goats, and the goat herder invited us to have tea with him. We sat with him on the ground while he made a small fire and then made the tea. He had one small glass, and we all drank from it. It was a pretty special moment for me! That evening, we stayed at the hotel Kasbah Itran. The hotel overlooks the Rose Valley. We had dinner here, and then the staff and Mohammed played the drums and sang. We all ended up dancing in a circle together while singing, clapping and/or playing the drums. What a fun night! Here, I had an amazing room with stained glass windows and a view over the Valley. This was facing east, and the sunrise was stunning. After our breakfast, we started off for our journey into the desert. We stopped to look at the town Boumalne Dades at the edge of the Dades Valley - such an amazing view. This town looks like an elaborate sand castle against a backdrop of palm trees and the Atlas Mountains. We also stopped in the spectacular Todgha Gorge which was carved by the Todgha and Dades Rivers. After an authentic lunch of cous cous (it was Friday) in the town of Rissani, we continued on to the edge of the Sahara Desert, where we got on our camels for our ride (just over an hour) into Erg Chebbi - one of Morocco's two Saharan ergs - sand dunes. The camel ride was fun and easy(for me) and the camel was very well-behaved. This part of the desert is amazing - vast and with high dunes - just what I wanted to see! Mohammed and I climbed a dune near our camp; this may have been easy for my new friend, but not for me!!! But I was happy to do it for the great view! The tent camp is very comfortable - with rugs on the sand, a bathroom with running water, even a dining tent. I had my own tent of course, and the bed was comfortable and had plenty of blankets! That night we had a great dinner and then sat around a campfire until very late playing the drums and singing. The next morning, I climbed that dune again in order to watch the sunrise over the desert. This was another special moment! After that, we got back on the camels and went back to the edge of the desert where we had a hearty breakfast before heading on our long trek (8-9 hours) back to Marrakech. We had stops along the way, including lunch in an interesting town that was having its weekly market, and an area that was filled with fossils embedded into the rocks. This trip was amazing, filled with special experiences. As we neared the end, I was very sad as it meant saying goodbye to my great new friend, Mohammed. He made this trip the best it could be for me! it is clear Mohammed enjoys his job! He is personable, friendly, informative and thoughtful. He also takes great photos - hand him your camera or your smart phone and let him take some great pictures of you on this trip. I would highly recommend Camel Safaries to anyone - the experience was beyond my expectations. I want to do this again!!!"

We had a lot of laughs. They were very open to customisation during our trip. Mohammed took us to an amazing local restaurant to avoid the tourist traps. The accommodation (both hotels and Saharan camp) were perfect. Probably the highlight was the camel ride across the Sahara to stay 1 night in a Saharan camp. The camp itself had comfortable beds, plenty of blankets, and warm running water. We sat by the camp fire in the evening singing and playing music with the staff. We also got to see a great variety of Moroccan scenery and sites. I highly recommend Mohammed and Hasan to anyone considering a tour."

From the moment that our guide Abdoul and our driver Hassan picked us up in Marrakech, we knew we were in good hands. The 4x4 car was clean and comfortable and the journey, while long, never felt arduous. Hassan was an excellent driver and we felt safe the whole time. Abdoul is simply the best guide. He is knowledgable, friendly, professional and clearly loves his job. I fell ill during the trip and we were really impressed with the care taken to ensure I got medication I needed (despite many of the pharmacies being closed).Abdoul was incredibly flexible and allowed for customization along the route. Once we indicated that we enjoyed eating the local food, we got to experience a real Moroccan treat of grilled lamb in a local cafe! We thoroughly enjoyed the itinerary set out by Camel Safaries and felt that the stops were well thought out and well timed. The hotels that we were booked on were perfect. Small and intimate with lovely staff and delicious food. We ate extremely well on this trip!Ali was also extremely responsive and flexible during the planning stage. All in all, we cannot recommend this company or our guides Abdoul and Hassan enough... simply amazing!"

This trip completely exceeded our expectations and has been by far the highlight of our Morocco trip.Mohammed, our guide was an absolute star- he's one of the most genuine, friendly, kind people you will ever meet. He makes the journey interesting as he provides knowledge along the way to break up the long drives. He's so upbeat which is infectious, and we loved his camel dancing. He went above and beyond as he really cares that you enjoy your trip, and he really does become like a good friend.We felt in very safe hands with our driver Hassan, as he is a great driver- very safe and we didn't even flinch driving up the mountain roads with high drops (in other countries with similar roads I've resorted to closing my eyes in fear but this time I could enjoy the view!) Hassan is also a really friendly, helpful person and he and Mohammed make a great team.Booking our trip was easy, as Ali responded to all of my emails quickly and clearly, which assured me that I'd picked the right company for this trip as there seems to be a lot of choice! The hotel we stayed at for the first night was lovely, way nicer than we expected for the price! And the Berber camp on the second night was also beyond our expectations- we expected (and would have been happy with) basic facilities, but this was practically glamping- we had a real bed, real flushing toilets, amazing food and a magical evening under the stars! Thank you so much Camel Safaries! We will definitely be recommending this trip to all of our friends."

All hotel and travel arrangements were made in advance; Ali even booked our hotel in Marrakesh for us (we stayed 2 extra nights after the tour in the city). Ali himself was timely with all email responses both before and after the tour - it was really wonderful to go on a trip and not have to worry about anything - they did a superb job.

Right from start Ali was great with communication when organising and planning the tour and patiently responded to my many emails. The four day tour that we went on was amazing and a great mix of things such as a camel trek at Erg Chebby dunes, feeding monkeys at a forest, seeing amazing sites and visiting local people and a local market. There was flexibility as well, for example, in whether we wanted to do some shopping and where we wanted to eat. We really enjoyed the local food places that we were taken to. Even though we travelled long distances, it was comfortable in the four wheel drive, the scenery was amazing and our guide/driver Mohammed kept it interesting for us. He is a very friendly, funny guy who knows the country and the culture very well and we learnt so much from him. The hotels that we stayed at were great as well and the staff were very friendly.

By advance planning through examination of their website and also e-mail correspondence with owner Ali, all arrangements were made and executed beautifully. Since our group consisted of just my wife and I, we were assigned a Toyota Land Cruiser 4x4 with Guide Mostapha and driver Hassan for this 3 day, 2 night desert tour. Both were excellent and friendly, and there was no language issues as Mostapha spoke good English and Driver Hassan understood and could communicate directly or thru Mosptapha. The details of the itinerary are given on the website, so will not repeat here. The first day highlight was a visit to the world famous Kasbah Ben Houdou where over 25 Hollywood films were filmed. These include the iconic Lawrence of Arabia, The Gladiator, Pearls of Persia, Game of Thrones, etc. Just a word of caution: lunch at the supposedly \"best\" restaurant in this village was a disaster! Better to bring a packed lunch with you. Not the fault of Camelsafaries as all tour buses/cars stop at this place. Food here is really bad. The kasbah trek made up for the bad food, and the information given by our guide Mostapha was invaluable. The hotel Xaluca dades on the first night had excellent buffet dinner and equally good breakfast. Wi-fi works only in the hotel lobby and not in the rooms. But the loacation of the hotel and the food were both excellent! The second day highlight was a trip to the gorge, lunch at our guide Mostapha's home near the desert. His sister Zahara cooked us an excellent covered Pizza, with salad and starter almonds and other nuts. The next day, our driver Hassan's sister cooked for us a really spicy similar pizza to take away and eat while we were driving. Both these acts of kindness more than made up for the bad lunch on the first day. Such acts of friendliness endeared us to both Mostapha and Hassan, and were not part of the package. the highlight was the camel ride from the Camp Mohayut to the sand dunes desert berber tent! What an adventure for us two senior citizens aged 70! The sand dunes of Erg Chebbi are not to be missed! Well worth the long 550kms drive from Marrakech! The dinner was very good as was the company of international travellers in our group fro this segment for the trip. On the way to the desert, while drivi g, our driver Hassan took full advantage of the 4x4 car and took us off road for long periods. We were able to visit and desert camp made by Berber nomads and see their basic, rustic life-style and how they make their living rearing goats, etc. back at the sand dunes camp, sunset and sunrise were sights to behold! After dinner entertainment was provided by our three camelguides/cook through playing drums around a bonfire on the sand dunes. Lying on our back viewing the bright stars on a cold winter night was an experience of a lifetime!Thanks, Camelsafaries, and Mostapha and safe driving Hassan, for giving us such a wonderful experience! Would highly recommend this company for guided tours in Morocco."

During our recent trip (25th Nov to 6th Dec), we had our expectations met and had many surprises throughout our time in magical Maroc. Our trip started from Asilah, a town on the northwest tip of the Atlantic coast of Morocco where we stayed at Riad Tabia, hosted by the very hospitable Adil and his wife, Juri. The next day, we took a day trip to Tanger where we visited Hercules Cave, one of the most popular tourist attractions which is set along the Atlantic ocean. Mohammed then introduced us to our down-to-earth guide, Mr Murad who, by the way is a fit and charming 71 year old man! We explored the bustling medina including the fish market where the friendly fishmongers were more than happy to have their photos taken. Subsequently, we proceeded to Midelt, a town in central Morocco, in the high plains between the Middle Atlas and High Atlas mountain ranges so you can imagine how cold it was then. The journey was about 5 to 6 hours drive but with a cool driver like Mohammed, you can expect a smooth and safe ride. We stopped by many scenic spots recommended by Mohammed where we took countless photos of the welcoming locals, beautiful scenery and cute flocks of sheep during our drives throughout our stay in Morocco. We also made a quick stop in Meknes before reaching the endless sand dunes in Merzouga, which was our second visit to this calm, terracotta plains. Mohammed also brought us to the busy market in Rissani, a small town nearby where you can shop for cheap souvenirs like scarves and local wares and be awed by the everyday scenes you will probably not experience back home. Dades was our next stop where you can expect many kasbahs peppered along both sides of the long and winding road. There are many small hotels or what they call auberge where you can spend the night and, they serve the most excellent dinners like the one we put up in called Hotel Babylon Dades. The staff there were awesome and they teamed up with Mohammed that night to put up an upbeat performance with their local drums. The next morning, Mohammed drove us up to the highest point in Dades where we saw the most stunning view of the picturesque valley. It would be unthinkable to stare down the steep terrains for long but I assure you it is worth the trip up there. On our way to Ourzazate, we stopped by Boutghrar Dades, a rough and rocky patch where we were greeted with excited children who were pleased with the sweets we brought them. Mohammed brought us to yet another delightful place called Kasbah Itrane for lunch where we enjoyed a breathtaking view of the surrounding greenery. In Ourzazate, we stayed at the comfortable Dar Chamma, which had a cosy courtyard for you to laze the afternoon away as you indulge in your favourite book. The next city, Taroudant was simply magnificent as the place we stayed at, Riad El Aissi, was one huge place with a sprawling yard for you to take many beautiful photos and enjoy the outdoors in the lush garden. Here, we managed to explore the medina where we came across the varied local stuff from fruits to clothing to jewellery before we found ourselves in Agadir the following day while we were on our way to Essaouria. Essaouria, also known as Wind City has a pristine beach ideal for surfers and beach-goers. You can get delectable seafood and many colourful trinkets for family and friends as the medina in this town is very easy to walk around in and I'm sure you won't mind getting lost there! After two days, we headed to Marrakech for the night where you should visit the energetic Jamaa el Fna in Marrakesh's medina quarter. We ended the memorable trip when Mohammed dropped us off at Casablanca. I would highly recommend Camel Safaries to anyone who would like to visit Morocco as they are reliable and more importantly that they try their best to suit your travel plans to ensure that you experience the best of Maroc."

Hands down the best day of our trip was our trekking tour of the Berber village Imlill along with a driving tour of the mountainous region between Marrakech and Imlill. Ibrahim was our driver and he was AWESOME, extremely friendly, funny and knowledgeable. The scenery was spectacular and our lunch with a Berber family was delicious. I would recommend this to anyone, I just wish we had more time to take another trip with Camel Safaris."

We highly recommend this tour or any other tour that this company offers. We covered a lot of miles but Mohammed, our guide was not just very informative and entertaining as we drove but also was very skillful in arranging appropriate stops for magical sites and great food. We visited markets and kasbahs seemingly off the tourist track. We were even fortunate to shake hands with Mohammed's father, a stately old soldier and sister, a lovely young woman. If we had a chance we would return without hesitation to Morocco and would want to see other aspects of this wonderful country with Mohammed's guidance.Some of the TripAdvisor questions are not applicable to such an excursion. We recommend you experience this for yourself, you will not be disappointed."

Our driver Ali was everything we could have wished for, and more. He welcomed us into his family home for lunch on the first day of Eid ul-Adha, to share their sacrificed sheep, we felt so honoured, thank you!, and not known to us at the time, he was given some very tragic news of his brother, but without a stumble, he made sure he got us to the desert, before returning back home to his family. Amazing person. Together with, his knowledge of Morocco was in depth and very interesting, he also was a very safe driver !!- highly recommend Ali and Camel Safaries."

Me and my girlfriend would like to thank Ali & Hassan for such a wonderful trip which is well worth every penny!Day 1: we got picked up bang on time from our Rihad in Merrakech in the morning around 8am who even waiting for us to sort out the last few things! Drove to towards the atlas stopping of at wonderful kasbah's along the way will Ali kept us informed of interesting infomation of the areas as we drove through!Then we reached our wonderful kasbah hotel for the evening with stunning views and a authentic but luxurious stay with good food and tradition musicDay 2: woke up to a lovely breakfast overlooking a wonderful valley then departed on the road to the sahra desert in our 4x4 we went off-roading which was really fun with Hassan potentially a better driver than my dad! With plenty of intetesting stops and breaks along the way to keep us entertained always taking us to the more authentic than tourist location which was also the ethos for the whole trip.In the afternoon we arrived at the edge of the desert to a even better kasbah hotel to wash, have a drink, use the super good wifi and leave our bags overnight before embarking on our camels for the trek to our camp in the desert, also they sell beer and wine at the kasbah before you leave and bring it for you in a cool box to the dessert camp (nice touch) we got on our camels and were led across the dessert with plenty of photo oppertunites and also watched the sunset as well before we arrived to our camp for tea and dinner, drinks, music and good convosation! We choose to bring out matresses outside and sleep under the best view of the stars I have ever seen!Day 3: back on the camels to the kasbah for a lovely breakfast, shower etc to depart on the drive back to Merrakech, quite a drive to be honest but a nice touch on the way was stopping at a great little italian place becuase to be honest Ali knew we would be bored of tajines! they drove us to the hotel and yeah just have woken up to write him a review!I could highly recommened this tour so worth every penny they we great and you should book!Thanks to Ali, Hassan, Paul & Joy and Ki x"

            "review": "Totally worth it!!. I went on this solely on the other reviews on TripAdvisor and I wasn't disappointed. I did the 2 day tour with my girlfriend, where we had our own Berber guide, Hassan, drive us through beautiful landscapes down to Zagora. It is a very full on day, but it goes quickly. When we finally arrived at the camels, it was a beautiful ride through the desert to the accommodation. Our camel guide, Ibrahim, is a total dude! Super friendly and welcoming as well as patient. I must recommend that when riding a camel, you should wear tight fitting trousers, and ask for more blankets if you are lacking a posterior..... It will rub (maybe even bring a pillow, I'm not kidding) Regardless of this, it was still awesome!! The accommodation in the desert is also brilliant. Our tent had proper beds and electricity, and they also provided soap and clean towels. The site had flushing toilets and showers, so it was much appreciated. The site can accommodate many many tourists, but there was only us two on this tour. They made us feel so welcome and we had such a laugh trying to learn Arabic and Berber. The highlight was all of us having a jam on their drums. I'm a drummer for a living, so it was an absolute joy!! Ali in the office is also very quick in responding to emails and it is run very efficiently. Highly recommended!! :-)"

            "review": "Wonderful Experience with Mohammed Maazouz of Camel Safaries. My friends and I (a group of 5) visited Morocco for the first time in early September 2015. One of my friends booked the tour with Camel Safaries so I had zero expectations, but I was very surprised and satisfied with our tour with Camel Safaries and appreciated experiencing Morocco with an excellent private tour guide.OUR TOUR AND EXPERIENCEWe did the 4 days/3 nights tour from Marrakech through the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara Desert which was customizable according to our interests. Mohammed Maazouz served as both our driver and tour guide, who was exceptional (more on him later in my review). The varied landscape from Marrakech out towards the Sahara desert is extremely beautiful, and made all the better with Mohammed providing background to the landscape features and rural towns. The anti-Atlas mountain range on our drive back to Marrakech were incredibly breathtaking - flat land pocketed by low trees and shrubs juxtaposed with unique rock formations. The camel riding and camping in the desert is a nice experience, but the less \"touristy\" parts of the tour were the most memorable. We did experience a sand storm during our camel ride out to the desert camp, so come prepared with a buff or scarf to cover your face. One of the highlights of our tour was being invited to a day-before-the-wedding celebration lunch. Mohammed knew the family and it was such a fun experience to be \"one of the locals\" by eating a wonderful meal with a large gathering of friends and family members. We were clearly foreigners but were treated like one of the normal guests. My favorite part of our trip was interacting and spending some time with a nomad family. Mohammed seemed to know her and her young children personally and it was a very eye-opening experience learning how a typical nomad family lives. The meals were great - some were pretty touristy, but at the same time, those of us who had weaker stomachs appreciated those places. My favorite meal though, was eating at a local restaurant (packed and not a tourist in sight!) on our last day on the long drive back to Marrakech. I'm a vegetarian but ended up eating the beef meatballs and lamb chops to experience a true Moroccan meal. Other activities we did, that I'd recommend: visiting Mohammed's family's date tree stand in an oasis, walking around Ait Ben Haddou (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), and visiting the local market and eating fresh figs. I could have done without the visit to the Pigeons du Sable and the argan oil co-op visit, which I felt were tourist traps.OUR GUIDE, MOHAMMED MAAZOUZI don't think I can do Mohammed justice in this review. Mohammed has a way of making people feel very comfortable and welcomed. He has a calming personality and is very knowledgeable, as a tour guide should be. I don't know how Mohammed does it, but he drove for hours and hours in the company's Toyota Land Cruiser, and my group and I always felt safe. Despite the fact that he hosts a number of tours throughout the year, he really does treat your group like you're special. I never felt like simply a paycheck for him. Mohammed also seemed to care about our lives and interests and was patient in answering our seemingly endless questions about the Berber culture and people. I truly believe that having Mohammed as our tour guide really made our trip and cannot recommend him enough. LAST THOUGHTSIt ended up being a really great and memorable trip. The takeaway is that the tour can be completely tailored to your interests. You don't have to do anything you don't feel like doing. Mohammed always gave us options and asked us where we wanted to go next. I would recommend selecting the higher level accommodations/hotel stays so you are thoroughly comfortable on the trip. Also, make sure you have enough dirham before you leave the big city; there were only a few ATMs along the way in the rural towns and villages. Camel Safaries is a solid choice for a tour guide company and well priced. I believe having a guide, especially if it is your first visit to Morocco, is essential to not only experiencing but learning about and understanding the rich history, beautiful places, and the varied people of Morocco."

When I first found Ali online in 2006, when I led my first small group to Morocco, I had no idea what I would find when I met him and signed on for a tour. All these years later, I can say from my heart that Ali is simply the best--at every level. Guide, friend, and like family to me--Ali has gently guided my groups on 12 different 16- to 21-day trips through the country he knows so well. Intelligent, kind, knowledgable, and professional, Ali is the best guide imaginable. Although it is difficult for me to be objective after all this time, I can't imagine being in better hands than with Ali and his crew. Funny, unflappable, able to problem solve on the spot, he is able to offer custom designed trips and tours of any length or price point, Ali can create a perfect journey, a perfect way to experience the incredible culture and people of Morocco. I can't offer enough praise or assign enough stars to recommend this amazing young man and his company.As I said...my guide, my friend, my family."

My son and my sister and I booked this trip just knowing that we wanted to say that we had ridden camels in the Moroccan desert - not many people get that opportunity. What we weren't counting on were the awe inspiring vistas as we drove through the Atlas Mountains, the visions of the Berbers as they went along the streets with their happy faces, the beautiful (and not so beautiful) villages along the way. But most of all, the generosity and hospitality of our guide, Ali, during the Eid Al-Adha celebrations, who welcomed us into his home, giving us an experience we could never replicate. His professionalism and warmth at a time of great tragedy in his family is something that will stay with us forever. Thank you, Ali, and thank you Mohammed for delivering us safely back to Marrakech. If it wasn't for this tour, we may have had a very different opinion of Morocco (having only experienced the madness of Marrakech to that point), but now we can't recommend it highly enough."

Firstly, having a guide who is Morroccan is a huge advantage in getting to understand the country, the people and their culture. Secondly, Mohammed is incredibly pleasant to spend time with, always keen to answer and discuss any and all our questions (which we had plenty of), very informative and his English is excellent. We particularly appreciated his kind and generous invitation to share in his family's celebration of Aid-al-Adha, a once in a lifetime experience. In addition, the itinerary covered everything we wanted/needed to see, and suited us really well. The Land Rover was very comfortable. We'd highly recommend the Riad Madu tents in the desert.Thanks to Mohammed, we had an unforgettable experience in Morocco. Also, the payment process through GetYourGuide was seamless (another company asked for a Western Union transfer, which was more difficult)."

What we didn't know is that we would be cared for by Mohammed, an intelligent, funny and very likeable guide who made the trip the highlight of our 2 weeks in Morocco. Sure, the overnight camel excursion was once-in-a lifetime, and sure the Gorges were breathtaking, and the apes were fun. But to see this part of the country in only 3 days requires very long days in the car- and with Mohammed it was more than just bearable, it was a rich experience. He was very knowledgable on everything Moroccan, and quickly figured out what we would find interesting. Happily, the 4x4 was comfortable, air conditioned and well- equipped. Each morning Mohammed ensured that the windows were so clean that I could take perfect pictures from inside the car! And our best times were stopping along the way in small towns to have a local meal with the locals, or sharing a 'Berber whiskey' with a nomad family. We can't say enough about the experience- thanks to the professionals at Camel Safaries."

Mohammed is not only a guide but also a friend, he took lots beautiful pics for us, and every place we drove to, he told lots of histories and stories about Morocco for us. Although sometimes drove more than 10 hours, but he always made us happy and enjoy every minute. He is a very devout Muslims, is so kind and friendly. He knew so much information about his country. We can feel his love to Morocco. He is so kind, sometimes we went through the poor village, he always stoped the car, and gave some sweets or fruits to the kids. He is so patient to every person. At last, I must to say, he is a very very good driver. Thank u so much, Mohammed, you made these days special! It is the best memories for us.

From mint tea with local oasis farmers to real Moroccan BBQ and freshly-picked figs, Mohammed went above and beyond to introduce us to the best things Morocco has to offer. It was powerfully clear that Mohammed takes great pride in both his country and in showing it to the travelers of the world. Mohammed is also highly skilled. He speaks excellent English and, as a driver, is a paradigm of cool, calm, and collected.

It was a stunning experience, We where taken care of at all times and everything was made to make us feel at home. The Suv where brand new and the driving very careful and smooth, which is really most important due to the roads we had to take at times. Above all, more than the outstanding sceneries and places we got to visit and discover, it was the human quality, the unforgettable kindness and the professionalism of the whole team that made this travel unique and that I would recommend to anyone."

We had booked a tour with Camel Safaris before we left. Mohammed was our guide. As a single parent I was a little worried when we first drove away from Marrakech. I had no need to worry. Mohammed was an amazing guide. He was kind, helpful and friendly, but above all he was a absolute wealth of knowledge regarding all things to do with Morocco. His knowledge of the history of the country was outstanding and this combined with his geographical knowledge meant that we learnt so much in 3 days. My son even came away saying he had learnt more from Mohammed than he had learnt in the past year in history and geography lessons at school! Mohammed's ease at sharing his knowledge was also a real gift.As to his driving skills, we felt completely safe the whole time. We did experience one difficult situation, when because of an accident in a village that we were supposed to travel through, the only alternative was to cross a fast flowing river. Both Mohammed's judgement skills and his driving skills paid off here as after considering the options carefully, he drove us over the river with no difficulty.Camel Safaris had also arranged a super hotel at the edge of the desert for the first night of the tour. For the second night we camped in the desert after riding the camels for the afternoon.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend both Camel Safaris and especially Mohammed, he is a gem. This trip is talked about regularly in our household as one of our best trips. Thanks Camel Safaris and Mohammed!"

I have no idea how Muhammed Maazouz, still a young man, has acquired so much information about his country - its history, Islam, flora and fauna, back roads, geography, its politics, its regional differences and customs, etc.... for raw information alone the guy is great. But then you add how genuinely friendly he is, how patient with kids, how flexible, how prompt, his great driving (particularly on the crazy back roads of the Atlas Mountains), the relationships he's built up with locals, and how solicitous and helpful he is all the time without fail... well my goodness. Our tour with him was just superb. We had 4 nights and 5 days on the tour - started in Marrakech, then down to the desert, then a drop off in Fez. The amazing thing is that it all took place smack in the middle of Ramadan. I.e., the guy was up at 3:30 am for prayers, then no food or drink all day. I kept waiting for him to show some level of irritability brought on by physical discomfort, but he was unfailingly kind and helpful throughout. One of the things he told us was how right behavior, including how you perform at your job, is an important piece of being a good Muslim. Muhammed walks this talk.PS - one of our daughters forgot her Kindle in his car. They're shipping it back to us, no charge. This company is a class act."

We didn't want to do the camel safari because there were some camel-related disease in the Middle East at that time, so Mohammed arranged a quad bike for us to drive us to the centre of the desert.

I was in Marrakech two years ago during spring break with some friends and we decided to go on a camel safari in the Sahara Desert with this tour company. I was very impressed with the quality of this company. Our guide was Mohammed, and he was very professional and genuine in terms of how he presented his country to us and in making sure that we were having an enjoyable experience. Mohammed speaks excellent English, and I never had trouble understanding any part of the tour with him. He made absolutely sure that we were always comfortable with our accommodations, food and activities, and I felt safe and happy that I had made the decision to choose this company.

My boyfriend and I were blown away with the incredible experience we were offered by Camel Safaris when we booked to travel with them from Marrakech to Fez over the course of three days in July 2015. Good friends had highly recommended that we travel through Morocco with this particular company as they had also had a unique and memorable experience back in 2012.We we treated with great care and professionalism right from the initial correspondence with Ali which was prompt and hugely informative as he guided us through the many and varied options available. It was clear that the itinerary could be flexible and was absolutely tailored to our spec of dates and interests. We even made a last minute amendment to the start date of our tour which Ali actioned with immediate effect and zero fuss. He was a true pleasure to book through as we felt more and more secure that this was indeed THE company to tour with. The A/C 4x4's are comfortable and spacious and felt like our own space for three days.... and then we met Mohammed - the wonderful, personable, conscientious driver who would be hosting our tour which further fueled our excitement to get going. Ali had arranged for Mohammed to visit us at our Riad a couple of nights before beginning our tour to answer any questions and tell us a little more about his proposed itinerary.Once again, from initial meeting to the big hugs at the end of the trip, Mohammed was kind, consistently careful on the roads, informative and overall incredibly personable, genuinely ensuring that we had a hugely special experience. Our highlight was camel trekking to spend a night out in the desert, and watching the sun rise over the Sahara the following morning which was unforgettable.I work within the service industry, and recognise the importance of both positive feedback and constructive criticism, however I quite honestly could not fault Camel Safaris in any single way. Mohammed is a gem, as I'm sure the rest of Ali's team are, and I would 100% recommend Camel Safaris to any other lucky travellers who have the opportunity to explore Morocco. Ultimate care and comfort is what they offer - you will not be disappointed!"

The drive is long but the stops along the way are breath taking. Driving to the peak of the high Atlas Mountains (second tallest mountain peak in Africa!) was a once in a life time experience. When we stopped for lunch were also able to tour at a beautiful Kasbah in which many movies and tv shows were filmed. We arrived late to our camels but the guides there were very accommodating. Our camel guide was excellent and even shared some of his fruit and local foods when we stopped briefly for a desert picnic so he could break his fast. The camp site was well maintained, safe, and comfortable. Our meals were very nice and following dinner we had a great time playing music and hanging out with the guides and other visitors on different camel treks (ours was the best). Mohammed was available for any thing we needed the entire time, even in the evenings at the camp site, he was honest and thoughtful and the entire adventure was well organized.

As two young American women traveling alone in a foreign country, we were a bit worried about choosing the right tour guides for our time in the desert of Morocco. Lucky for us, we chose wisely... and had the most incredible time!!! Everything was well organized and laid back. Our guides, Anass and Ali, showed us an amazing time. From our pick up in Marrakech, through the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara desert, and then on to Fes. Of our ten days in Morocco, the 4 days we spent with Camel Safaries stand out above the rest of the trip. 100%.We booked a 2 night, 3 day tour (with only one night in the desert). After the first day, we knew we had to extend it! Camel Safaries was super flexible in letting us add on an extra day with no problem... and we were SO glad we did. We spent an extra day with them and our 4x4 driver, Mohammed, who was so much fun!!! By the end of day 2 & 3, we felt like we were exploring the desert with old friends, truly. Our guide Ali, took us to his family's house to have lunch on the way to the desert, which was an unexpected surprise. They were so wonderful about answering our MANY questions about their culture, religion, and way of life in Morocco. The night spent in the desert was wonderful- but I will say we didn't have the best circumstances. It was a full moon, so it was difficult to see many stars (be sure to plan your night in the desert around the moon!). Otherwise, it was wonderful. On our 4x4 day with Mohammed, he drove us to what seemed like the middle of nowhere in the Sahara and we stopped for a game of volleyball, while camels watched us in the distance. We then found the only tree around, where they made us a picnic lunch and impromptu fire (despite the heat of the sun!). Another one of our favorite moments.They also connected us with a nomad family in the Sahara desert, who we spent an afternoon with. Their way of life was fascinating! So fascinating, that we decided to come back later for dinner with them (after they kindly invited us). That dinner was one of the most memorable travel experiences I've ever had. Mohammed drove us through the desert back to their nomad hut, and we brought them the food supplies to cook dinner. We then went to have something to drink and watch the sunset in the desert with the guides while we waited for them to cook our dinner. That time was very special. Once we returned to the nomad's house it was dark... the only light being the full moon. Mohammed brought candles that we placed around the room we would eat in- which made the entire meal feel like a family holiday. We ate by candlelight with the nomads and had the most unique and wonderful experience with them. They even invited us to spend the night in their hut, but we sadly had to leave early the next morning for Fes. I really cannot say enough great things about Camel Safaries. We were so lucky to have found them... and have continued to be in touch, as they became our friends. If you're looking for a unique experience with wonderful guides... these are your guys!"

As well, we really wanted sandwiches during lunch and Anas made that possible for us. Though Anas was fasting, he was still flawless in his work.

A quick note: we are frequent international travelers who have never gone on an organized tour before. When we travel, we usually do a bunch of research, rent a car, and go at it on our own. After reading the reviews of Camel Safaris (and not speaking a word of Berber or Arabic, and only a few words of French), booking a tour seemed prudent, and I'm so glad we did!Ali helped arrange everything ahead of time, and his emails were always very prompt and friendly. Mohammed picked us up in Fes, and we liked him from the start. He's super smart, polite, charming, and obviously loves his country. We had such a great time talking to him about the customs, religion, food, politics, favorite soccer teams, etc. The tour itself was fantastic, too - we fed monkeys in a cedar forest, rode camels into the desert and spent the night in a Berber tent, toured an underground well, visited an ancient kasbah, drove through the most beautiful gorges and oases, and ate the best food in roadside cafes with not a tourist in sight. The hotel where we stayed in Ouarzazete was gorgeous, and the desert hotel where we cleaned up after the desert camping was great, too (we had booked the mid-level accommodation level and were blown away that both weren't considered 'luxury'). The whole trip really avoided anything overtly touristy-feeling (camel-riding is inherently touristy, but it was *awesome* and a bucket-list thing for us). I kept thinking how happy I was that we'd chosen this tour to really get a feel of the countryside (and make a new Moroccan friend in Mohammed). Had we just visited the big cities on our trip to Morocco, it would have completely transformed the vacation. We never would have learned so much about the culture and experienced the country's rural beauty without Camel Safaris; skipping the tour would have been a huge mistake! I highly recommend this company and the experience it provides."

Great reviews did not do our experience justice - Superb, enriching, different every day, wonderful guide who is now a friend, and welcomed us into his village and big circle of friends and relatives, exotic hotels, great Toyota Land Cruiser vehicle for off-roading with the Berber nomads, and for about half the per day cost of Rick Steve with our exclusive, wonderful driver!If you want an unforgettable experience, and don't want to be just a tourist, Mohammed, our driver, and Ali at Camel Safaris were a super choice for us."

We had such a wonderful time and wish we could of had more time to explore! Our guide, Mohammed, was awesome! He was so friendly and accommodating, he made us feel like we could customize our trip however we wanted, and ended up being a great photographer! If we wanted to stop by a sight we could or if not head on to the next adventure.It was incredible how much we fit into 3 days! He was so knowledgeable and answered all our questions even if they were silly. The car was very nice and clean and very comfortable especially when we had to travel for several hours at a time. We felt that in three short days we saw more of Morocco then we ever would have on our own and it was such an authentic experience and did not feel very touristy, and a big reason for that was Mohammed. One of our favorite parts of the trip was riding camels into the Sahara desert to stay the night. It was an unforgettable experience and the stars were gorgeous. The next day we got to meet Mohammed's mother and she gave us a berber pizza, it was so delicious! Unfortunately, Mohammed got stung by a bee while we were eating it, but he was in good spirits even with a bee sting! We stayed at a hotel in the Valley of the Roses, it had one of the most incredible views we have ever seen. For the price we paid they over-delivered. By the end of this trip we had such and incredible time, Mohammed and the tour more than exceeded our expectations. We left Morocco with so much knowledge of the culture, great experiences and a new friend, Mohammed. We would recommend this company to anyone and we would definitely return for another tour."

I visited Morocco for the first time in February and cannot say enough good things about the beautiful country, the kind people we met, and my tour with Camel Safaries. My friends and I enjoyed our visit from the moment we were picked up by our guide in Fes to the end in Marrakech that came way too soon - three days wasn't nearly enough! We were well taken care of by our guide Mohammed who was with us from start to finish. He was wonderful the entire time, always smiling and in the best of spirits, making sure we were enjoying ourselves throughout the trip. He was very patient with the unending list of questions we had about everything we were seeing and had a detailed answer for each one! We were lucky to enjoy delicious Moroccan food, learn so much about the culture, and see beautiful landscapes and touristic sites. We would have never been able to plan the amazing trip that we had on our own. I originally planned to visit only Fes and Marrakech, but after having gone on a tour between the two I am so thankful to have see everything in between - it was the smaller towns and sites along the way that I enjoyed the most! I owe it to Camel Safaries, our awesome guide Mohammed, and the amazing crews at the hotels we stopped at along the way for a truly incredible trip! If you are considering a visit, absolutely book with Camel Safaries, they will make sure you have a great time!"

We don't typically take organized tours but decided the best way to do this was by paying for a guide. After MUCH research, my friend found Mohammed and Camel Safaries. This was ABSOLUTELY worth every penny. Mohammed picked us up for our 3 day tour and drove us out to a beautiful city none of us remember the name to. Along the way, we stopped for scenic photo ops, lunch, casbah ruins, a detour through a palm tree grove, and a little off roading. We would not have had the opportunity to see what we did without our awesome guide Mohammed. He was knowledgeable and friendly and lots of fun. The next two days were just as great! I think the absolute best was the local market he took us to with donkey parking and livestock for sale with a little Berber pizza picnic in the Sahara desert. I can't say enough about Mohammed's hospitality and how respectful he is. Choose Camel Safaries and I promise you won't regret it!"

Many roads were broken and impassable. We had to reschedule and change our itinerary, often at the last minute. Ali and his team were fully accommodating, sending us information and suggesting alternatives, all with our safety in mind. My email chain with Ali reached almost 40 long messages back-&-forth. In the end, by delaying our trip by 4 days so that the roads could be repaired, and doing our trip in reverse (Fes -> Sahara -> Marrakesh), we had a successful trip.Youssef (pronounced yu-su) was our guide. He was an excellent driver, especially given that many of the roads we traversed were covered in pot-holes, partially washed away, or even covered by a surging river (we had to wait for the water to subside for that one.) We never felt unsafe with Youssef at the wheels.Seeing the Sahara sunrise is bucket-list worthy, and is now one of my favorite things ever. Sandboarding down the dunes and riding the camels were also super fun. If you visit Morocco, don't hesitate about making the long trip to the Sahara, and if you do, Camel Safaries is a terrific choice."

            "review": "'wow- What a Trip!'. We travelled to Morocco with our 2 teenage boys to have a bit of an adventure. We had 11 days to fit in an awful lot and travel a long way! Having read the reviews for Camel Safaries we decided to see if Ali could come up with an Itinerary to suit our needs in the time frame allowed. Not only did he come up with everything we asked for but the price was affordable and included everything except our drinks and lunches. We had a Toyota 4x4 driven by Ibrahim our very happy (and safe) driver and Mustapha our guide who was the font of all knowledge (answering our thousands of questions ),who was very courteous, amenable and spoke great English. They both had a great sense of humour which suited our family down to the ground! We stayed in a variety of beautiful old Riads along the way,all slightly different but lovely and the food was always great.We did a camel ride and an overnight stay in Berber tents in the desert..that night we had the best Tagine of the whole trip followed by a drum party and the boys had a go on sandboards down the dunes as the sun went down..what a great night! The guys hired brand new quad bikes the next day and had the time of their lives riding through the dunes and back to our Riad for a candlelit supper under the trees!We saw the most spectacular scenery on our 3 day journey to the coast which was continually changing and quite breathtaking. We stopped whenever we liked to stretch our legs and take photos and always had a nice lunch somewhere en route. Our final few days were spent in Essaouira, surfing,paddleboarding, relaxing and horseriding. Ali sought out a lovely quiet surf beach not too far away as a suggested option and made sure we could hire boards there, the waves were massive and we had a fantastic time. As we had 3 nights in the same hotel Ali had arranged that we only ate at the hotel for one and got to go and experience other fantastic restaurants that served seafood on the other 2 nights..that was brilliant and so thoughtful. Having Mustapha with us gave us the chance to go to places and see things we would't have done had we driven ourselves and we learnt so much about life in Morocco from him. We really got a taste of the local culture,which is just what we had wanted and all learnt to say a few things in Arabic/Berber which the locals seemed to enjoy.. We all give Ali and his team a massive thumbs up and thank you for making our trip everything we hoped for and more."

            "review": "Good Experience. We did the five days/four nights from Marrakesh to Fez with our three children ages 11-16. Everything was very well organized and Hassan our guide was very friendly and upbeat with the kids. We especially liked meeting his friend in his home town who gave us a tour of the market and played a bit of soccer with our girls. The camel trek and staying in the Berber tent exceeded our expectations.This is a pretty straightforward tour so expect to see other tours following the same path as you. The exception is one day where you do go off the beaten path to see the Berbers in the caves which was very interesting and a lot of driving that day, but getting off the beaten path frequently is. The mid range places were nicer than I expected, but also larger (less intimate) than I expected. There is a lot of ground to cover in a short amount of time so there is a lot of driving almost every day (4.5-7hrs a day) which limited our spontaneous exploring. If you can take longer and break it up more, I highly suggest it. The breakfasts and dinners were all very good. Lunch options were limited bc it was Ramadan, but instead of hot sit down lunches of tagine and kebobs at usually more than 10USD per person, picking up fresh foods like bread, cheese, and tomotoes from local markets would have been preferable, but less available bc of the timing. Overall, this is a solid choice, well organized and well priced."

He was also very knowledgable about pretty much everything and always kept us entertained with stories and facts about what we were seeing.The overnight stay in the dessert was far more luxurious than I had expected. There are showers, running water and the tents even have beds and furniture. The only downside is that we found the dishes a bit dirty. All in all I highly reccommend them because we felt very well taken after and enjoyed every minute of the tour."

We couldn't say better things about our guide and driver Youssef who was kind, friendly and knowledgeable (and a very safe driver!). It was also great to have a guide from the Erg Chebbi/Merzouga region who knew the area very well. We stayed at great hotels for the duration of our trip and Ali was very accommodating during our trip planning and to last minute itinerary changes we wanted to make (while we were already on day 2 of our trip). We were never rushed and had the flexibility to visit anything we were interested in (or skip anything we weren't). The price that Ali quoted us from the beginning was reasonable and while on arrival guides were eager to offer us a lower price, we found comfort in paying a little extra for safety, reliability and comfort throughout our trip. (Others we met who traveled with other companies/guides varied greatly when it came to their experiences and satisfaction with their trips and accommodations) I would absolutely recommend camel safaries (and our guide Yousef!) to anyone visiting Morocco. PS I would recommend a 4 day vs. a 3 night trip as you will be doing a lot of driving and having the day to rest in Merzouga prior to our overnight desert camping was a wonderful break!"

We appreciated the promptness and flexibility that Ali and the company showed to helping us design our itinerary. Our primary guide and driver was Ibrahim. He was a careful and SAFE driver, had a great sense of humor, was supportive of our photography focus, and like Ali in the head office, he was flexible and worked hard to get us to the places that we wanted to go. He was a fount of information about the desert and about the customs of Berber people. We loved hearing his stories about his family's partial transition from desert nomadism to settled town life, and were amazed at his musical talents as well. We also arranged a transfer from Marrakech to Casablanca Airport with a stop at the Hassan II mosque. Our driver on that day was Ali (not the same as Ali the owner), and he was also very friendly, and we really enjoyed learning from him about the history of Morocco and the Berber people. Our impression is that Camel Safaris is a great company that it is continuing to improve. Director Ali checked in with his drivers every day, and both he and the drivers sincerely asked us for feedback/constructive criticism. We do not know if we will return to Morocco in the near future, but if we do we will gladly work with Camel Safaris again!Will Betz and Debbie Williamson"

After a few months of trip planning and research, we decided to hire a local touring company for the section of Atlas and central Morocco. I contacted Camel&Safaries based on the good reviews at the TripAdvisor for their quality services provided. Ali patiently worked with me to customize the itinerary to fulfill my wish list. He was very responsive to all my questions. We booked a 4 day 3 night Atlas, central Morocco, desert and Volubilis tour, started from Marrakech and ended at Meknes. Camel&Safaries provided a nine seat Mercedi-Benz van, a driver (Anazis) and a tour guid (Mohammed) With all the luggages, we could still seated comfortably in the car for 4 days. Both the guide and driver were very knowledgeable and informative. They not only answered all our questions, but also enlightened us with their living cultures by their personal/family stories. We had many laughs and shared stories of cultural differences. It was like a family vacation. At the end of the tour and before dropping us at our hotel in Meknes, Mohammed had gone out of his way to arrange a private car for us taking us to Fez the next day afternoon. It was a comfortable ride at a reasonable price. In a summary, the quality of the inclusive services, accommodations and meals in this tour was beyond our expectations. We had a wonderful time in Morocco; the tour with Camel&Safaries was one of the major tributes to this memorable experience. The lunches were not included in the tour package. The restaurants Mohammed took us for lunches were very touristy; especially the one in Meknes was pricy and not good. Camel&Safaries may check out other restaurants for better selections."

We were collected from our beautiful little Riad in the Fez Medina by Hamid. Hamid's experience, knowledge and command of English meant that the long road trips were constantly fascinating and entertaining. Feeding the monkeys in the cedar forests of the Middle Atlas gave us a welcome break from the road. Hamid always found excellent places to stop and eat and was extremely flexible when it came to what we did and didn't want to see (Argan Oil co-operative - YES! Film sets - Not really!) Our night under the stars and camel ride was truly magical and none of us resented being woken to sit on a dune and watch the sunrise. We loved the Todra Gorges and the stunning Ait Ben Haddad. Crossing the High Atlas and sweeping down the valley to Marrakech was another highlight. I'd do it all again tomorrow..."

They handled everything incredibly well, and I would highly recommend them to anyone else traveling to Morocco. I looked around for a while to find a good company, and unless you want to go super cheap and everything that comes with it (crappy hotels, drivers who don't speak English, etc.), this one is well worth the money. Oh, and make sure to ask for Hassan - he rules."

I had contacted another agency and put to both of them what we wanted to see and the time frame allowed. Camel safaries came back with the best itinery. The long drive days were interspersed with shorter days and very comfortably 3 stays that were of 2 nights duration.We chose the luxury accommodation and were not disappointed except for one huge hotel which was not what we would have chosen. The camel ride and the over night stay in the desert was magical, sharing our dinner with a small group of people from all over the world.Mohammed our guide was fantastic and we came out our trip a lot wiser about this society than when we started. Not to forget Brahim our courteous driver. Thank you camel safaries for great memories. I highly recommend this agency for a holiday in Morocco."

Luckily a co-worker had taken a tour with Camel Safaries and had been very pleased. I began to correspond with Mohammed - who I believe does most of the email correspondence - and found him to be very delightful. We decided to do a 4 day/3 night tour from Marrakesh to Fes - via the Sahara.Mohammed and Mohammed (our driver) picked us up right on time at our Riad. He had contacted us the day before to make sure that we had arrived safely and would be ready to go. Over the next four days we learned alot about Morocco. Mohammed was always willing and able to answer any questions and to make suggestions.We stayed at the Kabash Chez Pierre the first night where we had a lovely room and the best dinner of our trip. It was fantastic!Our second night we enjoyed in the desert. Unfortunately it was overcast, it actually rained (!), so we did not get either a great sunset or sunrise or a great view of the stars. However, we had a good time with the other 9 guests telling stories and listening to the Berber music provided by our hosts. Tents were comfortable. We had a hotel room back at the base where we started from and were able to leave most of our belongings there.Mohammed arranged for Berber pizza the next day which my husband has said was the best food he had. We saw so much that it is impossible to go into detail. I would trust Mohammed and his Uncle who owns the company to look into and help with any arrangements you want. At our request Mohammed also made arrangements for a guides in the Medina for both Marrekesh and Fes. Which we highly recommend.We likely won't be back in Morocco soon - as there are other places we want to see - but if I was going I would definitely book through Camel Safaries."

We were driven in a comfortable, capable jeep by the brilliant Barack who showed us his incredible country! We listened to native music, saw the most breathtaking sights and drank many a cup of mint tea. In particular,watching the sunset, star-gazing and the sunrise in the Sahara were just spectacular.

One of our travelers was vegetarian and Ali was very helpful in finding us restaurants we could all enjoy. Through him, we also befriended several locals who I still keep in touch with and whom gave us a local's perspective on life in Morocco. In a country where you might expect some hiccups during travel, this trip was completely worry-free and went so smoothly because Ali and our driver, Youssef, handled everything. The people at Camel Safaries are not just professionals at what they do, but they are good people. By the end of our trip, we all become good friends.

Ali was our primary contact in arranging the custom tour and was always helpful and responsive along the way.Our driver for the entire trip was Brahim. Picked us up upon arrival in Casablanca and headed straight towards Fez with a stop in Meknes. We met a local guide in Meknes for a 2 hour tour of town, then into Fez. We spent 1.5 days in Fez (with a terrific female local guide -- since we were 2 girls travelling, it was fascinating to ask her about life in Morocco). We also enjoyed our stop at a ceramics factory in Fez (may have been a bit touristy, but the ceramics were beautiful and nicer quality than ones we found elsewhere). We then continued on to Marrakesh for 3 days, meeting a local guide there as well. We took a one day excursion to Essaouira for a change of scenery and it was nice to escape the heat and chaos Marrakesh. Flew out of Marrakesh. Camel safaries provided all transportation and transfers. The restaurants they took us to were good (perhaps not outstanding), but the last night in Marrakesh we really enjoyed dinner at a more modern, less touristy restaurant outside of the kasbah walls -- near the post office downtown. It was a nicer place with modern takes on Moroccan flavors. Unfortunately I can't remember the name... but you should ask your driver for alternative options with dining when you start to get tired of the same old tagines and pastillas and cous cous, which we ate for the first 4 days of the trip.We stayed in great riads (see my other reviews) booked through Camel Safaries.Overall, Camel Safaries was great. They required only a deposit upon booking (via Western Union) and we paid the balance in cash in person at the conclusion of our tour (so be prepared to carry a lot of cash throughout the tour).The only downside -- we were focused on meeting Brahim at the Casablanca airport upon arrival and neglected to get local currency from the ATM right away, thinking it would be easy to stop at an ATM along the way. Brahim was concerned about us using a rural ATM on a Sunday in case there were issues with the transaction, so we didn't end up getting cash until day 3 of the trip. In the meantime, he was our personal currency exchange. This wasn't Camel Safaries' problem so much as a suggestion for other travellers to go ahead and get local currency from the ATM at the airport!"

I also wanted to add a note to recommend our guide, Mohamed Mazouz, who was incredible. He was incredibly engaging throughout the trip, and made my wife and I feel like family. I suggest requesting him, you won't be disappointed!Overall, I highly recommend Camel Safaries for anybody who wants to see some of Morocco outside of the main cities.

Your expert guidance and easy nature brought light and humor throughout our journey and eased any worries we may have had as first time visitors. We saw and experienced so much on our way to the desert that we almost could not believe the tour 'could' get any better. Then we met our camels (Omar Sharif & Jimi Hendrix) and our wildest expectations were eclipsed! It has been three weeks since our return and we continue to fondly reminiscence about our great adventure! We look forward to the opportunity to return again with family and friends to join in on your incredible tours!"

He picked us up at the Riad and off we went. We took this trip out to the desert with Ali, a driver and 2 other people we be-friended on the trip. It was a beautiful drive into the desert, stopping along a few towns to explore and eat. The drive deeper into the desert was very hot. At one point we pulled over to chase a huge yellow lizard. It was quite fun. Once we arrived we each got into a camel and Ali put us into the care of a guide who took us into the desert sand dunes to a camp site which was already set up. There we settled in. We played music with our guide, drank wine, and the guide made us an amazing Tagine in the desert sand. The best I've had! We all decided to sleep side by side outside under the stars because the tents felt very dark. At some point in the middle of the night we saw comets and shooting starts.... We watched the sun come up and then we prepared to explore a bit before returning to meet Ali. It was amazing! I did however think, if our guide happens to drop dead, how would we leave this place??? I guess Ai would have come for us. :) It was one of the best experiences ever.... And Ali is great. Very informative, fun and accommodating."

Ali is diplomatic, client orientated and will address your interests and needs. Just one of our examples, fresh fish from market grilled specially for us. Good selection of \"authentic\" riads and hotels for affordable price. Ali will give you good advice on anything related to Morroco. We had wonderful 10 days in Morroco:)"

Was thinking of doing a camel safari and I researched several companies, but at the end of the day, i chose this one and I didn't regret it one bit. At first, I was a little nervous, but Ali is really friendly and he even came to pick us up at the Riad. Omar was also very friendly and his driving never gave us any cause for concern.The tour was well thought out, as every day was fun filled with activities. We actually chose a multi-day trip and it was very nice that he chose for us various accommodations so we see what the residences are like. From sleeping in a goat hair tent in the dessert, to a mud/straw hut in the middle of the mountains, to more modern establishments. Our highlight was most definitely the camel ride to see the sunset in the dessert. Also eating freshly caught fish in Essaouria was great. Ali has a great understanding of Moroccan culture and he educated us on every thing we asked! He's like a mini Moroccan encyclopedia :)"

I came across Camel Safaries on the internet and thus got in touch with Ali , who really managed to sort out a wonderful 3-days-desert tour that was financially manageable for us.Upon arriving in Merzouga, we were picked up by Mohamed, our guide. After having a nice breakfast together, we were shown the village and then started our camel ride.I can only say that these 3 days were one of the most intense days of my life!! Mohamed was very knowledgeable and provided us with lots of interesting information on Berber life, the desert and everything. He is also a great storyteller and can speak innumerable languages (even bits and pieces of Chinese)!After the first night at a Nomad family's home (which was more than recommendable), I got a little sick because of the sun and heat, but Mohamed went out of his way to help me feel better!So if I come back to Morocco, I will definately book with Camel Safaries again, as they give you the feeling to discover something REAL, something heartfelt! Thank you for that!"

My husband and I met Ali in Marrakesh which was a fabulous city. He showed us around, but gave us ample time to explore on our own. I don't usually take tours since I like to stumble upon things myself, but Ali provided the right mix of guidance and independence. His English is impeccable and he answered such candid questions of ours. We really got a good feel for the culture. We did a lot of driving through the Atlas Mountains to Fez, the Sahara Desert and then to Casablanca. Yosef was an excellent driver and also entertaining. We were never at a loss for words and laughed a lot. He also sang for us and answered lots of our questions. My favorite part was the camel ride in the desert and then sleeping overnight in a tent. It was just an amazing experience and so beautiful. I can't recommend them enough. It's a trip I will never forget!"

My partner Tracy and I met Ali from Camel Safaris in Marrakesh on the recommendation of a Canadian couple we had met in 2009.We both immediately liked and felt comfortable with Ali and signed up for a 5 days trip commencing the next morning.We thoroughly enjoyed the experience, being one of the highlights of a 6 mth vacation through North Africa and Europe.Ali and Yusuf ( his calm and deliberate driver) made the 5 days navigating some difficult terrain and cultural differences a breeze. There was never any moments where we felt 'obligated' to buy from a local vendor ( as had happened previously on tours) and Tracy was treated with the utmost respect and courtesy.Ali has designed his Tours extremely well. Each day is fascinating, with appropriate breaks for meals factored into the schedule. The drive from Marrakesh into the Sahara was breathtaking, my DSLR was working overtime, and meeting the woman who lives in a cave with her family was also a highlight.We are still in contact with Ali, in fact on our return to Australia a glass of Saharan sand was accidently thrown out and upon emailing Ali he sent me another bag of sand!! Now that's service.We can't recommend Camel Safaris highly enough."

            "review": "Fantastic experience with Camel Safaries. Back in 2007, we took a phenomenal 10-day tour of Morocco. We found Ali Oussou through a posting on TripAdvisor, and he subsequently sent me half-a-dozen references, one in my own hometown whom I met for coffee. After speak to Ali by email and phone and then meeting his reference in person, I felt quite comfortable booking him for our trip. He helped me plan our itinerary and booked hotels for us. Our itinerary was: Marrakesh - Ouarzazate - Tinghir - Merzouga - Midelt - Fez - Rabat - Casablanca.Ali picked us up from the airport with his driver Youssef and a 4x4 Toyota Land Cruiser. He stayed with us the whole time as we sped across southern Morocco, stopping in tiny Berber villages along the way. He also arranged a 2-day camel trek into the desert, along with sandboarding - one of the most amazing experiences we have ever had.Ali speaks Berber, Classical Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, French, English and Spanish, and has a degree in Linguistics from the University of Meknes. He was a knowledgeable, friendly and very competent guide.We became good friends with both Ali and Youssef. If we ever took a local guide in one of the big cities (local guides are required by law in each city), Ali personally introduced us to him in advance. Youssef himself owns the Toyota and always made sure it was clean, functioning and safely guarded.Ali even arranged a cell phone for us, and texted us while we were with local guides to make sure everything was OK.Due to Ali's knowledge and hard work, we felt like guests in Morocco, not tourists. He introduced us to numerous locals in a way that you are never able to in groups. We had tea with a Berber woman who lives in a cave and has 11 children. As Ali put it, She has very little money but a very big heart.This trip really put into perspective the diversity of life in our world, and we returned to Morocco amazed in every way; by the rich culture, geography, language, cuisine, and hospitality. We could never have had such an amazing experience had we not had the good fortune of finding Ali Oussou."

Our group are not the sort of people who would generally choose to go on a guided tour of a country and have found our way around countries by ourselves previously. We hummed and harred about whether to go with a guide. My wife convinced us to go with Ali and Yousif as her mother had travelled with them before and had raved about it.We did not regret the decision at all.We would have missed so much if we had not travelled with Ali. His knowledge of the local areas was amazing and we went off the beaten path to see things that we would have drifted past if we had travelled solo.Some of the hotels were a bit of an adventure and they certainly added to the experience. The vehicle was comfortable and we stopped to take in the scenery and meet the locals, cats and camels along the way.Ali proved to be quite the entertainer and gave us a display of his drumming at a restaurant we stopped at along the way. The proprietors all seemed to know and like Ali and Yousif and were always happy to see him and share some jokes with him. We would not have been so well received if we had not been with them I'm sure. Our tour was the middle section of a two week holiday and was easily the highlight of the fortnight. We started in Marakech and were dropped off in Essaouira.It surprised us that Ali received messages and calls from previous travellers on our trip, but since leaving Morocco we have kept in touch and are promising ourselves that we will return and catch up with the eternally youthful Ali in person.If you can't decide whether to travel with Camel Safaries, stop thinking about it and just do it. The only reservations you should have fpr one of these tours should be in the charismatic hotels along the way."

Months before the trip, we corresponded via emails and Ali was always prompt with his replies. I had a thousand questions and Ali was never short of answers. He picked us up from the airport and travelled with us throughout. What I liked about him the most was his positive attitude - anything you ask, he'd say \"It's possible\" - and he'd make it possible also. When my husband fell sick because of the heat in Merzouga, he arranged to keep the room for one whole day without any extra charge, so that my husband could sleep in through the day. The Riads we stayed in were breathtaking, the car that travelled with us was top notch, the places we visited were magical. We are absolute foodies and Ali made sure we ate at the local places and the Tagines and Tanginas we've had there were far more delicious than the ones at renowned but touristic restaurants.Ali is polite, friendly, enthusiastic, honest, flexible and it's very apparent that he takes pride in showing off his country to foreigners. Our driver was Hamid and he is such a sweet guy - a bit shy, but extremely funny. We are usually independent travellers, but decided to go through a pre-arranged tour of Morocco because of shortage of time and the distance we had to travel and I don't regret that I did it. The car was at our disposal and the distances, though very long sometimes, with enough stops in between, through breath taking landscapes, was worth it. I shopped around quite a bit before booking the tour through Camel Safaries and the reviews that I got on TripAdvisor and other travel forums about Camel Safaries was bang on and it was relatively cheaper too, than some of the quotes I got from other recommended guides and travel companies.I would absolutely recommend Ali and Camel Safaries to anyone planning a trip to Morocco. Thanks Ali. You made it a very memorable holiday."

Although I traveled by myself, I was accompanied by a guide and a driver. The duration of my trip fell on the period of Ramadan this year and my driver and my guide traveling with me under scorching sun for hours without water and food. However, they never complained and in fact, they were usually the one who tried to keep me awake by talking to me(I usually was tired out from the heat) and telling me stories of Morocco. They definitely show me the famous hospitality of Moroccans as they invited me to break the fast with them most nights and they became like my family members by the end of the trip. In the span of 2 weeks, I got to see Morocco's diverse landscapes, beautiful architecture, amazing artwork and mostly, the hospitality and warmth of Moroccans. People were so wonderful and were not hesitating to open up their doors and their hearts to me. When I left, I was being told that I have 2 new families in Morocco now and I will always be welcomed back. It was definitely an amazing trip and a great eye-opener, I will never forget about it and look forward to my future visit. Thank to Camel Safaries and a great thanks to Mohammed, Hamid, Brian and Ali for their wonderful work. You truly represent the essence of Morocco."

The tour we arranged involved departing from Marrakech and going through the High Atlas mountains, stopping by many sights in south-eastern Morocco, the first night in Dades Gorge and day 2 camping out in the desert in a berber tent, and the last day driving through the Middle Atlas mountains onto F\u00e9s. This was by far the best part of my holiday, especially the night in the desert.Ali really took care of us and did all he could to give us the best tour he could give. You could really see this was something he loved to do. Despite the long distance from Marrakech to the desert and then to F\u00e9s, we stopped to see so many things that it didn't feel like a long car ride. Ali talked the whole way tirelessly explaining every little detail, I felt bad at times when I would nod off because he was making so much of an effort and I really appreciated it as opposed to someone just driving you. The things we saw were amazing too. The snow covered High Atlas and Middle Atlas mountains, monkeys in the cedar forest, several Casbahs (the best being A\u00eft Benhaddou) and Oases, and some impressive valleys like Todra Gorge. We couldn't have seen these places in the amount of time on our own, nor would we have dared driving through those scary roads at the High Atlas mountains. When we got to the desert, I couldn't believe my eyes. It looked like a painting! I took a bottle full of sand from the Sahara as a souvenir just to show friends how red the sand is. The night out was also quite amazing. Despite the cold weather I got a rug out next to the fire and lay down with 2 thick blankets on top of me and just stared at the stars for ages. Its just amazing how lit up the sky is when there are no lights. The tents themselves are very traditional except for the beds inside, but i appreciated this since i already lay on the sand next to fire and couldn't imagine doing that for the night. If anyone is ever considering a trip to Morocco don't just hang out in the big cities like Marrakesh or F\u00e9s, make the effort to see the desert it really is worth it! Weeks before this trip when I was in Thailand for xmas, I remember talking to some norwegian tourists in my hotel who told me how unremarkable their desert tour was and how uncomfortable the camel ride was but I have to say the camel ride did not feel uncomfortable at all. It was very well cushioned and I was on such a high during the 2 hr camel ride that by the time it ended i was like .. oh are we there already??6 months on I still remember Morocco and how great it was there. Thanks Ali for an unforgettable 3 days."

We returned recently from 10 day tour covering the northern part of Morocco (Asilah [coast], Chefchaouen, Fes, Meknes, Volubilis) and mid-region areas Marrakech, Essaouira (coast), and Imlil. Consistency is the key\u2026.once again, Camel Safaries, exceeded our expectations. Our guide was just as detailed oriented, knowledgeable, and professional as our other tours. The vehicle was clearly well maintained and we felt at ease and safe with the driver especially on those winding roads! Camel Safaries employs experienced, local individuals that speak English very well and truly are passionate about their country and their jobs. Each was very personable which was so appreciated as we do enjoy conversations learning about the culture and intricacies of local life. It\u2019s amazing how many lovely areas there are in Morocco. Asilah was suggested through our research on travel sites like TripAdvisor and we were very pleased as it was much less touristy than expected. Essaouira was a lovely coastal town but a touristy. I highly recommend the \u201cfish stalls\u201d. A market of fresh fish, you choose and purchase, and next door is prepared to your liking in an outdoor restaurant area. Chefchaouen, a beautiful hillside village, located in the Rif mountains\u2026artistic blue-washed homes and wonderful place to wander. Fes was definitely a much larger city than Marrakech. We preferred Marrakech. The square of djemaa el Fna is always entertaining and of course, brushing-up on negotiating skills with time to shop amongst the various souks is a great experience and fun!"

We truly had a wonderful time, and enjoyed every minute of it! The trip was short, and everything went pretty fast (3 days / 2 nights only). Our driver was wonderful, and really made the trip an unforgettable. He quickly understood what type of trip we were looking for, and became a part of the group without being too much or all over the place. Great recommandations of places to see in the way, slight changes in the itinerary to make sure we'd get the best out of the trip. Communications with Liz have also been excellent. Fast answers, helpful, and always right on. Would definitely recommend!"

            "review": "amazing time, seamless organization. My husband and I, with another couple, recently spent a week in Morocco. Liz provided great suggestions on places to stay, as well as planning our driver and city tour guides. We started in Marrakech and traveled by car (over 2 days) to Erg Chebbi and the night in a very nice tent in the Sahara. We then traveled up to Fes and finally on to Chefchaouen, before flying out of Tangier. Everywhere Liz arranged for us to stay, even in the dusty town of Skoura, was elegant and very modern. We also discovered that the Moroccan people are very welcoming to Westerners, speak more English than we ever thought they would, and are very proud of their diverse country and cultures (Berber and Arab). Food was delicious. Breakfasts are opulent, including Moroccan fried pastries, fruit, yogurt and always an omelet or scrambled eggs. Morocco produces very nice wine, and everywhere we ate offered a cocktail and beer/wine menu. We never felt threatened or uncomfortable. The souks were bustling but vendors were respectful, especially after our first night riad host (Massimo at Riad Clos d'Arts) coached us on being polite in Morocco. We learned that a downward gaze (direct eye contact is bold) with a polite\"not today\" and a touch of hand to heart to symbolize you're understanding works very well. Never had a problem! We learned so much from our driver Ali on all our road travels and asked him all sorts of questions (family life, Berber v Arab culture) and he seemed to love to share answers. And he was an excellent driver on some very windy mountain passes. I would encourage anyone to go and use Authentic Moroccco"

We had an AMAZING time, and the tour was the highlight of out trip! Hassan & Abdul made it a great experience! While my husband and I generally don't do tours, I was surprised how comfortable, interesting, and relaxing it was to have two people who know the area, language, and culture with us to show us things and explain the interesting landmarks. Hassan was a very steady driver, and we felt very safe. Abdul's English was great, and his knowledge of the countryside, and love & respect for Morocco, was very apparent. Even though the drive was long (because we did it in 3 days) it was fascinating. And, of course, having a driver we trusted let us relax enough to occasionally nap as well. The food stops and sight seeing stops along the way were interesting, well-timed, clean, and we stayed healthy the entire trip. The stay in the palm oasis, Dar Lorkam, was delightful. The hosts there were very friendly and dinner was wonderful, the room spotless, and the grounds delightful.The camel trip into the desert was an amazing experience. We had a small group of 3 couples, and everyone spoke English so we could socialize freely. We saw other big groups with 12+ camels and I was pleased we had the smaller, more intimate group.We were worried about being too cold, but that wasn't the case when we went mid-April. Our English speaking host at camp, also named Abdul, chatted with us at dinner (which was tasty) and he was very friendly and open, sharing his life and culture.I would mention that the authentic deep-desert camp tents aren't completely sealed (North Face tents wouldn't be very authentic, in hindsight!) So know your camping comfort zone!I would highly recommend this trip!"

Our guide, Abdul was easy going, knowledgeable, and very accommodating, and we all very much enjoyed the day seeing the Atlas mountains up close, hiking, visiting villages and having lunch at a Kasbah. He kept our 2 teenagers engaged, and went the extra mile to make sure our day was everything we wanted it to be.Authentic Morocco is so easy to recommend, and some day, when we return, we will definitely have them plan our trip to the Sahara."

Misha was a wonderful driver, kind to our daughters, very open and welcoming and chatty with me and my husband. He shared a lot of his life story with us and took a great deal of time explaining everything we saw along the drive. We loved Ifrane and the macaques! The Ziz valley and gorge gave my photographer husband several hundred amazing frames. When we arrived at the edge of the dunes, everything was ready and waiting and our camels were gorgeous! Mohammed, our fantastic Berber camel man was absolutely charming. We learned about dromedaries, he told us lots of interesting stories about the desert and the Berbers, he made beautiful sand pictures for us and wrote our names in arabic, which was lovely to see. He sat at the top of a dune with us as the sun set, talking about Islam and war and ancient history and children and family and the desert, it was an hour we will never forget. Then he popped our two teenage daughters onto his saddle blanket and sledged them down the dune like a sleigh! One of our daughters said later that she wished she could go home with him to his deep desert camp and spend a month with his family because she was sure they would all be gentle and fun and open in spirit, as Mohammed was with us. Our return to the camp in the dark with an inky sky overhead brimming full of stars was just as I had imagined, all the rugs lit by moroccan pierced lanterns and flickering candles, it was magical. The hosts at our camp were delightful and our dinner was wonderful. We slept in total luxury and comfort in our beautiful tents, my husband felt like a sultan, which was nice to see because he usually gets lost in the madness of a family of four daughters. We got ourselves up to watch the sunrise and it couldn't have been better. We felt completely at ease, unrushed, relaxed, breakfast was a huge feast and Misha returned for us bang on time. We loved the drive back and the visit to the fossil cooperative, so interesting! Again, the nicest man who showed us around and explained everything in perfect English and great detail. Our daughters were completely captivated. All in all, it was precisely everything we had hoped for: an unforgettable and wonderful experience made safe and comfortable and easy by the great attention and care of Liz and her team."

I think she hit the nail on the head for the most part. We enjoyed seeing and staying in Marrakech, but also loved traveling with Abdul to the Atlas Mountains and then to the Sahara. The perfect blend of experiencing both the city and the rest of the country. The desert camp we stayed in was beyond breathtaking, and it's only available via Authentic Morocco, so that was super cool. The only suggestion I have is to warn people more about how much money to bring. With all the tips and the entrance fees to museums, we underestimated how much we would need and ended up having to go to the ATM several times."

Very much enjoyed the stops during the day for coffee and lunch at interesting locations, getting the chance to interact with charming courteous people. Having travelled quite extensively across the world, I think the Moroccans are among the most well mannered, friendly and respectful, and importantly, possessing a good sense of humour. We particularly liked Bab Ourika, just an hour or so away from Marrakech, and set in a stunning location. If you go, try the Berber omellette for breakfast. Riad Dar Zitoune down in Taroudant is one of the most enjoyable places I have ever stayed at, where Monaime and his team provide stunning food in a beautiful setting. Next time we plan to stay in one of the Berber tents. Our drive north over Test-n-Tizi was one of the best I have ever had, and having lived in Norway for some time, that is saying something.

She was so flexible and helpful for months. It was not until October when we finalized the details, especially when coordinating our trip back to Fes, which at the time, the rest of the group was returning to Marrakech. Planning a trip abroad and sending someone all your money is a scary feeling. Having never been to Morocco, I was worried about getting ripped off. The fact that Liz's company is certified and accredited by the Moroccan tourism agency and other travel associations such as Travel Trust Association gave me enough peace of mind. When I met Liz and her team, I knew instantly I made the right choice.First and foremost, do not underestimate the cold in the desert. High temps were 75-80s F and lows were mid 30s F. Pack for four seasons. If you need sunscreen, pack your own. Morocco does not sell sunscreen from what I've seen. The luxury desert camp was so incredibly worth it. I'm not quite sure what we would have done had we not had the heat generator and in-suite bathrooms. The rooms were so incredibly clean. Food was phenomenal and well balanced. The food menu had vegetarian options. Service was unparalleled. Liz did a great job merging the group and making sure we felt welcome and had the absolute best experience possible. Liz and her staff certainly delivered a first-class experience and an unforgettable one at that. I commend everyone for their wonderful hospitality and am eternally grateful for the best experience I could have imagined.Tips: Take out enough cash before your trip to tip the staff. Customary tips range from 12-25%. 200 hundred dirhams per car for the driver. Also the alcohol served is a la carte. For the luxury suite, there were ample amounts of toiletries, toilet paper and the shower pressure. I can't really speak for the regular camp but we had packed a mini sleeping bag, mylar blankets, and a neck lamp just in case."

The north-to-south road trip, as we traveled from Tangiers to Marrakech, brought to life the diversity of climate, geography and growing areas. We were fortunate to cross paths with Liz in the desert. She is full of life and stories. Liz has an amazing history and facility with the country.We would absolutely book with Authentic Morocco again and recommend Authentic Morocco to friends considering a trip."

He took us to a couple of off-the-beaten track places which were incomparable. When the restaurant he wanted to take us to for lunch looked too crowded with tour groups, he found us a quiet place with excellent food around the corner. When we wanted to go shopping, he took us to a wonderful place in Ouarzazate. By the end of the trip, we felt like he was part of the family. I highly recommend him and Authentic Morocco."

The trip was a three day experience two days driving to the desert but don't be turned off by the travel because you get to see so much of the county and culture. What made the trip great was Abdul! He was a great driver and tour guide! Myself and two other ladies decided to take a trip to Morocco not knowing what to expect when we arrived. Abdul was very helpful and knowledgeable, he was patient and answered all our questions about the culture and people of Morocco. Along the way he pulled over and let us take pictures and gave us history on every location we stopped at. I travel a lot for my job, not often do I get to travel for pleasure, it was great to have someone who loves his country and people and so willing to share his experiences. Abdul was one of the best tour guides I have had in a very long time. At the desert site the staff was great and friendly making us all feel welcomed. The food was great and all the staff was kind and attentive. Thank you for hiring such great employees! I will forward your company to my co-workers and friends who are interested in traveling to Morocco. My three trip was the second week in November 2015 the weather was great!Sharon"

However, I only had a week and knew some guidance was needed. Plus while I realize public transportation is available, I wasn't ready to tackle that aspect of travel with no language skills and being of a certain age!!! I contacted various agencies, but found Liz Williams of Authentic Morocco the best fit. Liz was very responsive to my numerous questions, and her agency holds pre-paid funds in trust until the end of the trip, which I felt was a valuable feature. She recommended an itinerary that stayed within my timeframe and budget (though I might have adjusted it for a few splurges in lodging!), and arranged my transportation with a driver from her in country staff. In each city (Rabat, Meknes, Fes and Marrakech) guides were scheduled (all outstanding), and my driver (Abdou) for the entire period was both a safe driver and personable. Really enjoyed staying in the riads suggested by Liz (see separate reviews of riads and hotel in Casa, my last night before flight heading towards home), and each provided an evening meal at extra cost in addition to the included breakfast. All meals were delicious! I'm already planning a return to Morocco in a few years, and have alerted Liz to this new trip!"

I was impressed by her knowledge and directness when I spoke with her on the phone and we decided to use Authentic Morocco and are very happy with our decision. Liz was very responsive to all my questions/emails. We were extremely happy with all the riads she recommended and the itinerary she suggested. Our driver was great--friendly, informative and helpful--even when we had to buy clothing for our son whose luggage never arrived. The car was large and comfortable for all 4 of us. The guides were good. All the riads had advance notice from Liz of our food allergies and accommodated us. We had a medical emergency--luckily in Marrekesh where Authentic Morocco has its office--and Driss came immediately to our riad and accompanied us to the hospital. We recommend Authentic Morocco without hesitation."

We decided to honeymoon in Morocco for five days and did lots of research before deciding we were going to do a tour rather than explore on our own and we found Authentic Morocco.Our first touch point was with Liz who continuously replied promptly and helped tailor a trip to what we wanted. I made lots of changes and Liz was very patient and helpful. In the end, we decided to do a 4-day tour. Day 1Fly into Fes, we met our two guides.We did a brief city tour for the afternoon. We were showed around by Ali would was lovely, very informative and even gifted us something in congratulations for our wedding. Day 2We drove to the Sahara and did the camel ride and luxury camp. Breathtaking. A must-do! Probably our favourite part was seeing the desert. Mustafa, the camp host was lovely!Day 3Drove to Skoura. Stayed at L'ma lodge. This was our favourite place, Vanessa was lovely and we had time to unwind and recoup from a few days in the car. Day 4Marrakech. The drive was long, a little sickening due to windy roads but totally worth it. The following day we didn't do a tour of Marrakech, we did that on our own which is perfectly fine and easy enough one you've been in Morocco for a few days. Although we drove anywhere between 5-8 hours each day and spent a lot of time in the car, which at times was painful, we're so glad we pushed through and chose to squish everything we wanted into our time there. Plus you're always stopping along the way at traditional Berber villages and to have lunch. Our driver, Rasheed, was quiet but still fun. Our guide Abdul was informative, honest, professional and genuine. Every time I had to use a bathroom he walked me right to the door and ensured I felt comfortable and safe all day. We were sad saying goodbye to Abdul as he became more like a friend than a guide by the end of the trip. We loved how we listened to authentic music in the car along the way and the boys made our drive much less painful. We felt comfortable and they looked after us very well. We had an amazing honeymoon and the tour just added to our wonderful holiday. I recommend Authentic Morocco to anyone who wants to do a tour throughout the amazing country!"

The guide Ahmed was well spoken in english, was extremely knowledgeable about Moroccan culture, history and the landscape, and went above and beyond to accommodate our every request throughout our entire journey together. The driver, Mubarak, was extremely skilled and knowledgeable of the route, and trust me when I say, not enough can be said about that part. The roads of Morocco, particularly through the High Atlas Mountains can be extremely challenging to navigate. We got to see everything we had been promised, and then some. The highlight of the trip was definitely the evening spent at the luxury Berber camp. The meal we were served was incredible and sitting out under the stars in the Sahara desert (Erg Chebbi) was something we won't ever forget."

The reason I chose Authentic Morocco in the first place was that they use local people and places and that the communication I had with Liz from the first enquiry was excellent. I always knew what was going on and I could always feel I could ask questions and would understand things.I was able to explain the types of things we would like to do and Liz listened to these and made sensible suggestions. I am glad I listened to her suggestions and we got to see some amazing sites because of this without too long days.So alas for us four weeks before departure my son was ambulanced to hospital and needed major abominable surgery which meant that at one point our travel plans were very undecided but Liz kept in touch and we made some adjustments to our intinary to accommodate this. We were sorry to miss the deep dessert experience but our luxury camp was excellent.The stops were perfect for our family of four (Skoura, Todra gorge, Erg Chebbi and Ait Benhaddou) and our driver Esham was excellent.The places we stayed were chosen brilliantly and suited us perfectly and those places could not do enough for us. We stayed in some fantastic accommodation where the people really cared and ate some fabulous food.Our driver went out of his way to entertain the children and keep it exciting for them and we saw some things we would never have done had we travelled independently. I would recommend them to anybody and this was the highlight of our Moroccan adventure."

It was my birthday the day we got there and when they found out, our guide had his wife make a cake, and they got some bottles of champagne to pop. We invited everyone to join in on the festivities. Our guide was Ali and we can not express enough our praise for him. He was the best guide. I can only imagine the patience it took to deal with 6 females, but he was great.

We were three women with a very ambitious itinerary and only 6 days to accomplish it, but AM pulled it off. Coordination with Liz was seamless, and every accommodation was beautiful and unique.We started in Marrakesh and after introductions to Ali, had no trouble finding our way (on our own) from Ksar Anika to and around the Jma al-Fna. Though we were a bit jet lagged, this first night was a good way to get our Moroccan bearings. The next day began a 3-day drive to Fes, with one night in Skoura at Dar Lokum and the 2nd night in the desert \"glamping\" at Erg Chebbi, then on to Fes, where we spent two nights at Riad Kettani (my personal favorite). The return to Marrakesh and Ksar Anika included a quick stop in Rabat to tour the Roman ruins and the Mohamed V Mausoleum.It was a lot of driving, but there were enough stops along the way to break up the trip, and Ali was so very gracious. It is clear that he and Liz have invested a lot of time and energy into developing relationships at each of the important sights. Ali seems to know someone in every town.Fes was the unanimous favorite. I agree with others who posted that the old city of Fes is too complicated to take on without a guide, unless you have a lot of time to spend finding your way back. Speaking French would be helpful as well. We had a city guide and though I was hesitant to get hooked into a glorified shopping trip, it wasn't like that at all. Our guide Khalid was clearly very proud of his city and its history / heritage, and like Ali (who also accompanied us) was a gracious and patient host. We did end up buying carpets (among other items) with Ali's help, but didn't feel pressured one bit. In fact, the haggling was part of the fun of it.We all thought the trip was too short, and spending more time in Fes as well as a full-on desert trek with multiple nights out would be top on our agenda for our return. When it is time, I will most certainly write Liz to make the arrangements!"

Our trip was a tour from Rabat, to Chefchaouen, to Volubilis (fantastic Roman ruins), to Moulay Idriss, to Meknes, and on to Fes. Overall, I can only conclude Liz has an incredible network and a lot of experience that allows her to pull this off. She has great contacts in every city. We especially liked Rose, who hosted us for lunch on the top floor of her riad in Moulay Idriss. She is an entrepreneur from Australia who bought and is remodeling a riad. She set a colorful table and served delicious food to wonderful excess in gorgeous Moroccan pottery.  Our driver was a total peach and accompanied us for the whole trip! Ali was not only an excellent driver, but a great guy. We had one gentleman who did not want to join us for some of the walking and Ali was so sweet to him, entertaining him while we did some strenuous climbing. Ali knows the true meaning of the hospitality industry and of kindness. I would put my life in his capable hands any day. He did everything from tying the larger suitcase on top of the car, to navigating difficult roads, to answering tourist type questions, to attending to our needs for coffee breaks and food, to helping to negotiate rug prices, etc., etc. etc. He is just wonderful and talented in languages, especially English. Then, in each city, we had a city guide and they were excellent. They were all extremely informed, well dressed, and articulate. They really knew their stuff!  Liz arranged for us to stay in or near medinas in riads, which I highly recommend. So much more fun than Americanesque hotels. Casa Hassan in Chefchaouen was adorable and included a very nice breakfast. A wonderful place for dinner was just across the street and to the left, and the food was to die for.  The riad in Fes was also really interesting. Incredibly, we had the whole riad to ourselves for the evening. Dinner was included and they set up a table in the center of the lobby. We bought 3 bottles of wine and consumed an amazing (included) dinner by candlelight. Magic. Then we had an included breakfast on the roof -- lots of food and a great atmosphere. They say one should not attempt the Fes medina without a guide and that is absolutely correct. One can figure out Chefchouen no problem, but one would get hopelessly lost in the Fes medina without a guide. Wear your walking shoes! Some of the climbs around the medinas in various cities were steep, but doable. All in all, I really did not want to leave. If I ever get to go back, I would call Liz and tell her to find Ali! AND -- all of my people on the tour were happy -- the best part of all."

She is excellent in responding promptly to messages, in answering questions clearly, and in providing information. The online payment system was also easy to use.AM provided everything that they were supposed to provide. Although I had read in the pre-trip information that drivers do not necessarily speak English, I had forgotten that during our first day. Although Hicham was an excellent driver and a very nice person, his English was very limited. The first day proved frustrating until I realized that we should not have expected him to provide much information. It did detract from one of our sightseeing stops. It was more important to us to have a competent driver and we felt comfortable with Hicham who was a cautious and competent driver.The vehicle itself had clearly seen significant use but it was comfortable. We did not have a guide riding with us in the car but had city guides in three cities. It is not clear to me whether AM has any control over which city guide they use or not. All three were fluent in English and easy to understand. The first guide was fine, the second a bit distant (personally and physically) and the third unpleasant. There was no shortage of information. Again, I don't know if the local AM representative has any choice among the city guides, but my guess is that they did. The riads which Liz recommended and reserved were all excellent and we were very happy with them.I became ill on the drive to Marrakech and had to make a minor change in our itinerary. Driss, the man in charge of the AM office in Marrakech, was terrific. He assisted us in finding lodging for the night that we were supposed to be elsewhere, took us to the new lodging on that day, and arranged to pick us up again when we resumed our regular itinerary. He also rearranged our schedule in Marrakech until I felt well enough to do a bit of walking. He was excellent and I really appreciated his concern and his help.Liz was also extremely helpful in completing the forms that I needed to send to my insurance company to try to recoup the added costs that we incurred. I am sure this is never a favorite activity for travel companies but Liz was very prompt and always positive in her messages. I was grateful for that.In summary, everything was excellent with the exception of the guides and the limitations of the driver, the latter being announced ahead of time. I have traveled in many countries, mostly independently but sometimes with trips worked out with local companies, and am aware of the many things that can go wrong. The problems that I mentioned were minor compared to the rest of the trip and thus I rate Authentic Morocco as excellent."

We booked this day trip with very little notice - we were already in Marrakesh and knew we wanted a day trip to the mountains, so I dropped an email to Authentic Morocco just two days in advance of the trip. Liz got back to me straight away (despite being away in the Sahara!) with some numbers to call. I arranged to visit their office near Bab Doukalla, where I explained what we wanted to their helpful staff and they set everything up very quickly and smoothly, despite the short notice. We particularly wanted to visit the Glaoui Kasbah at Teluet, and so we were delighted to learn that this was possible in a day trip from Marrakesh. Our driver, Othman, came to collect us from our accommodation and proved to be an excellent driver, making us feel completely safe whether we were on winding mountain roads, bumpy desert tracks or in the Marrakesh traffic! The trip through the High Atlas was spectacular, and Othman was great at finding places with incredible views to stop for photographs (as well as the very important toilet/coffee/mint tea breaks). He also told us (in very good English) all about the local people, the villages and the landscape that we were passing through, and after we'd seen the amazing crumbling kasbah at Teluet he took us to see a series of other kasbahs in the area, via some of the most beautiful (and ever-changing) landscapes that we've ever seen. The only small criticism that we might have is that we were hoping to learn a bit about the local animal and plantlife of the area. We saw various interesting plants and birds on our journey but this didn't seem to be an area that Othman knew much about. However, this is only a small thing and perhaps we should have booked rather earlier if we wanted a specialist wildlife guide.All in all, we had an amazing day and would definitely recommend Authentic Morocco and Othman! The price (2000 Dh for four people) was higher than some of the less reputable tour companies might charge, but we felt it was absolutely worth it as we felt completely safe and well-looked after from start to finish."

Liz runs excellent trips. She's very knowledgeable about Morocco and has a wonderful staff! My camel guide Ahmid was great and very professional. As a woman traveling by myself I really appreciated how comfortable all Liz's staff made me feel. I did the overnight in the deep camp - an unforgettable experience and one I highly recommend. I also stayed in one of the little cabins at the dunelines camp. It was a wonderful place to stay, right there in the shadow of the great Erg Chebbi dunes. It was clean with comfy beds and nice hot showers. All the meals were excellent. I highly recommend Liz and her company. Use them to book all your travels in Morocco!"

We began at Marrakech, drove to the High Atlas, spent a night at a comfortable desert camp, with breakfast amidst the dunes of the Sahara, and played in the snow of the Middle Atlas. The cities we explored were evoked wonder for their history and cultural richness: A\u00eft Benhaddou, Ouarzazate, Fes, Meknes, Rabat, Ifrane, Casablanca and finally, Marrakech itself. The arrangements were exceptional - from booking to feedback on life in Morocco. Hats off to Liz Williams, the organizer, the ever-smiling Driss and their colleagues! There are so many things to experience - the richness of the country's geography, the wonderful people, not least the food and the music. There's too much to tell - you must try it yourself!"

Liz is so professional and was being very helpful with everything since before we traveled to Morocco. She nicely responded to every email and gave us extra advice when we asked about the mobile usage in Morocco. On the first day of the trip, Abdul picked us up from our hotel in Fes on time but unfortunately, it was snowing very heavy in Ifran and the road was closed making it impossible to continue along that route. We discussed with Liz about the situation where she offered us two options; one is to cancel the trip and they will take us back to Fes while another is to continue the journey but with a different route which is much longer than the planned one and could probably take 10+ hours to arrive Merzouga. Of course, we took option 2! We had a very long journey but Abdul was very nice and friendly and his driving skill is very good. When we arrived Merzouga, our luxury tent blew us away! It was so lovely, warm and cozy. The dinner under the candle light was very sweet and the food was delicious. The local staff is very fluent in English and is packed with interesting details and he talked us through details for the camel trek trip to see the sunrise on the next day. The sky was very clear on that night and lit up with million of stars and our local staff taught us about stars as well as how to use them as navigation and also about the nomad and the culture.We were supposed to have the camel trek trip to see the sunset on the first day but due to the situation that made us arrived very late, we missed it but the compensation was that we got two treks on the second day. One for the sunrise and another to the near village before we leave. The sunrise in Sahara desert is our once in a life time experience and will always be in our memory.I definitely recommend Authentic Morocco!"

From there, we traveled to Fes for several days and then made the drive to Erg Chebbi for an amazing night in the desert, where we took in a beautiful sunset and sunrise, along with a short camel ride. From the desert, we traveled to Kelaa Mgouna and Ait Benhaddou. Our final destination was in Marrakesh for several days.Our driver was Abderrahim (Abdo) and he was wonderful. He is extremely knowledgeable about his country and all the history and culture that it holds. Even though English is not his first language, he was able to hold conversation and answer all of our questions that we came up with. He became part of our group as we traveled and it was sad to see him leave us at the end.Liz did a very good job picking out riads and kasbahs for us to stay at. All of the employees were helpful and the places were very clean and accommodating. They were all so different from each other, that it really added to the uniqueness of the vacation. I would stay at any one of them during another trip to Morocco.This was my first trip to Morocco, but it definitely will not be my last. I am thrilled that Liz was able to put together such a wonderful vacation. I know I will be returning in the near future and I won't hesitate to contact Liz when I do. I wouldn't go with any other agency!"

We upgraded to the luxury tents and couldn't have been happier. It's still camping, but I am not a camper and I was perfectly comfortable. Hot water, clean sheets, wonderful breakfast, camel rides at sunrise and sunset. We took a quad tour in the dunes which they arranged no problem. New Years campfire with a DJ and singers and dancers. It was brutally cold at night, but they really made us very comfortable. The staff was fantastic, and I very much recommend this company - they really went out of their way to ensure we were all happy, saw everything we wanted, and I was very pleased. Thank you!"

            "review": "American Berber, Fadima and friends tour Morocco. First, the planning experience. Liz was prompt, thorough and eager to provide us with an experience that met the desires of two well-traveled couples. We spent many months reading, watching films, talking and emailing Liz and enjoyed the process of putting this trip together. We spent 11 days in country: Fes, Middle Atlas, Erg Chebbi dunes, Dades Gorge, Skoura oasis, Ait Benhaddou and Telouet through the High Atlas to Marrakech. Second, Abdul (not his Berber name :-), our driver/guide. We had such a wonderful time with this bright, articulate, well-educated, funny young man. He represents this company and his country so well and made our 7 days with him a delight. He was always professional, yet personal and accommodating, even managing to get us in to visit an excellent school in Skoura and have lunch prepared and served by a lovely lady in her home in the oasis. Our discussions about modern-day life in Morocco, family structure, city vs country living, education, medicine, and Moroccan and American politics and economies made our lengthy drives interesting and fun. There is a fine balance between professionalism and friendliness and Abdul has found that balance. We missed him a great deal when he left us in Marrakech.Third, the tour itself. Morocco is a world unto itself. Spending 3 nights each in riads in the Medinas of Fes and Marrakech were excellent. We stayed at Riad Fes Kettani and enjoyed the location, accommodations and hospitality. We, unfortunately, do not speak French and found communication a bit difficult, but appreciated that WE were the visitors in their country. The Fes medina is a wonder and we walked, and looked, shopped our way around it with our mouths open. It truly feels like a way of life that we didn't think existed today. We had a day to explore outside the medina and although it gave us a taste of modern/city life in Fes it was a day we could have missed. The Museum was a huge disappointment.Our desert experience was too short. We arrived just before sunset and after a very brief camel ride and climb to the top of the dunes the sun was down. The next morning was too cloudy to really appreciate the sunrise but the quiet and beauty of the desert is always a thrill. We wish we had had more hours (possibly 4-wheel drive vehicle) to take us further out for some additional exploring. The luxury camp was excellent, great candle-lit dinner for the four of us. Mohammed was a generous host and provided a superb traditional dinner and breakfast.Arriving in the Dades Gorge to the Hotel Chez Pierre on a cool, rainy late afternoon we were greeted by a cedar fire and hot tea, charming rooms ranging up the hillside, and one of the finest French meals I've experienced. Totally unexpected. Three brothers run this great hotel, one is the chef. Wow. We drove and walked through the gorgeous gorge the next day and again appreciated the skills of our driver Abdul as he negotiated the twists, turns and elevation of this wild road. It is truly spectacular.Skoura Palm Oasis and the Kasbah Ait Ben Damiette- Abdul told us to be prepared for wonderful hosts and food and we were not disappointed. Colette and Yanik greeted us as treasured friends and provided beautiful rooms, dining spaces and gardens and perfect French food. We were again wishing we could speak French but with the assistance of Abdul we ordered wine and communicated adequately. The day we spent walking and biking the oasis, eating lunch with Fadima in her traditional mud and straw home, touring the ancient Kasbahs and visiting the school were memorable. We finished up our tour driving over the High Atlas from Skoura to Marrakech. Jaw dropping elevations, beautiful little villages nestled into gorges, families walking the roads with their animals. Life appeared to these western eyes to be simple, quite beautiful and very hard.Marrakech- A very different medina experience compared to Fes. Much more commercial, busier, noisier, more fun. We stayed at Riad le J (only 4 rooms) and enjoyed our Italian host and his uniquely decorated riad. We ate at excellent restaurants (Nomad and Le Jardin) explored and people watched. The La Maison Arabe Cooking school was a true highlight and I'd recommend it highly. Very professional and held outside of the medina at a country club with gorgeous grounds and gardens. The tagine we prepared was the best we ate in country probably because we could add extra spice and not cook it too long. Also fit in a traditional hammam visit for a scrub and massage.Morocco is a very welcoming country, safe, stable and unique and we loved our time there. Suggestion: We covered a great deal of the country over the road and found the driving times much longer than we'd expected. We would not have missed out on the experiences or places we visited but would have liked a more accurate time frame. The city guides truly are merchandise peddlers ( a fact we were made aware of in advance.) We did make some purchases we are happy with but the bartering and pressure is something I do not like and will not do again.....ever.....anywhere. Just my personal opinion.Thank you Liz for your company, employees and love of Morocco."

Most Moroccans are pretty hospitable but Mustafa is so genuine that I felt like I was with family! I think the luxury tent upgrade is more than worth the value. Its not much more and its so special.

            "review": "Regret hiring Authentic Morocco. Authentic MoroccoWe chose Authentic Morocco for a tour between Fes and Marrakesh, during our two week trip to Morocco, based on TA reviews, Authentic Morocco's website info and email contacts with the company. We came to regret this decision. I have given details below, or you can jump to The Bottom Line at the end for a summation.The DriverOur driver seemed to be a nice man. He was polite and courteous. He was very prompt. He drove with skill between our accommodations on all types of roads. We felt safe at all times. Our driver was on his first assignment with Authentic Morocco. He was not one of the names mention in glowing terms in some TA reviews, or prominently displayed on Authentic Morocco's website. Our time with him was nothing like those described rich, learning experiences. Our driver speaks French and Spanish, in addition to his native Berber and Arabic. His English was better than any fragments of a second language that I have, so it is rather embarrassing to say we had trouble communicating. Over four days we got better at understanding his English. In the beginning of the trip, we tried to show our enthusiasm for learning about Morocco, but answers were very short, or unrelated to what we were trying to ask. Eventually we slowed in asking questions, and mostly drove from accommodation to accommodation in silence.Our driver told us to ask if we wanted to stop for a photo. By the time we got through the communication process so that he understood we wanted a stop we were usually well past the photo subject. He was always willing to go back. When it was safe to do so, we could reposition for still-life photos, but for anything with a moving subject (ie camel) the moment was generally lost. We tried taking photos out the window as we drove along but got few quality photos this way. As a result over four days we have a series of panoramic vistas, a few kasbas, and little else.The RouteAuthentic Morocco calls their trips tours. This implies more than we received, so we have described it as our route. We chose to extend the three day Fes to Marakesh trip to four days, based on Authentic Morocco's info that this would allow a slower, more relaxed pace. This was a mistake. We interpreted this as slower paced on the road portions, with more time to see things. It actually meant a lot more down time once we arrived at the evening accommodation.Day One we drove from Fes to our desert camp. The desert camp was the one highlite of our trip. The camp is actually very close to the centre were you meet the camel driver. The camel ride takes you into the desert and circles back to the tented camp. The tented camp was was an evocative experience described later.Day Two we left shortly before 10:00, drove directly, with a lengthy lunch break, and arrived at N'Kob. We were left on our own at 14:30. We are experienced travellers so we were fine to explore on our own in a place where we attracted a lot of attention. The town was very small, so we finished wandering quickly, and spent the afternoon and evening reading books.Day Three our notes advised us to pack a picnic lunch for our off road day through Tizi-n-Tazzazert. Our guide did not seem to understand we were to get picnic items, so we showed him our schedule. We went to the market, bought bananas and oranges. The market was a fascinating mix of color, costumes, people and goods. We would love to have spent some time there, but it was not on our schedule so we headed off on the road. The trip through Tizi-n-Tazzazert is serious second gear, 4 wheel driving for much of the way. It is stark mountain scenery. We were through the off road portion and traveling through towns on a good highway by 14:00, so we asked when we stopped for the picnic. Our driver was surprised we wanted a picnic, but pulled in to a restaurant where we ordered coffee and gave a substantial tip to sit on the patio and eat our picnic lunch. Clearly, we failed to understand why our trip details had instructed us to pack a picnic lunch if we could have just ordered from the restaurant's menu.Day Four we woke up realizing we had made a mistake in contracting with Authentic Morocco, and were anxious to get to Marakesh and travelling on our own. This day was marginally better as we had two scheduled stops to view kasbas on our own, or hire local guides, and an additional stop to see a cooperative selling handicrafts. We were dropped off in Marakesh at 18:00.The AccommodationsThe desert camp was a group of large tents, with board floor, around a central open area. We had a large, raised very comfortable bed. The cold water shower was challenging in the morning chill. Dinner was served outdoors in a wonderful setting. We ate privately near our tent, as did other guests. Dinner was a very nice variety of tajines, with meat and vegetables. It felt decadent sipping wine in the desert. The wine was basic and passable. The Moroccan musicians added to the ambiance.Kasbas Imdoukal, in N'Kob, was a large, very basic room. AC was good. The bathroom was large and clean. The shower had a very weak spray, and little hot water. We were asked for a choice of dining times and given a good choice of dinner options. Dinner and breakfast were both good.Dar Lorkam, in Skoura, was a very isolated place, several miles from the town site. Our guided had not been there before, and it took some time to find it. The room was spacious enough, very nicely designed, and very comfortable. The building design, and cool evening made a wonderful sleep. There was no AC, but it may never be necessary, given the design of the building. Shower had good spay, but ran short on hot water. The grounds had a lovely garden, pool, and seating areas. This was good as with the isolation meant there was nowhere to go to, so we just read books until our assigned 20:00 dinner time. There was only one choice for dinner, a tagine of ground beef. As Abdullah (see lower in Authentic Morocco) had insisted we should not eat ground meat while in Morocco, we just ate the soup and asked for extra bread. Better to go to bed hungry than risk stomach problems. Breakfast was a nice change, crepes with two jam spreads.Authentic MoroccoLiz Williams was very good in answering all our emails with questions about Authentic Morocco. The payment procedure was efficient. We very much appreciated the concern Abdullah, Authentic Morocco's local representative, showed when I became ill on the way to the desert camp. I had vomited on the highway and again just before our camel ride. Abdullah arranged that we could ride camels in the morning when I felt better. While the sunset ride would have been nicer, I really appreciated Abdullah's flexibility. Abdullah also gave me a large spoon of cumin and hot water to help my stomach. In the camp, he emphasized not to eat ANY yogurt. Probably the sealed, safe-looking yogurt I had eaten was the problem. He also advised no ground meat, and no vegetables not peeled or washed in mineral water. Abdullah gave me rice and a few vegetables with cumin, instead of the usual supper. For breakfast, Abdullah gave me bread and a drink of hot lemon juice with cumin. I do think his medications help me recover sooner.There were some concerns with Authentic Morocco. Our Fes riad owner tried to arrange an efficient morning pick up, but was unable to reach Authentic Morocco at the numbers we had. He told us he was going to try phoning the UK number. Later in the evening he informed us he had reached Authentic Morocco, but our driver was as yet unknown. In the morning, the Riad bell boy took us to the meeting point. The driver did not have the Authentic Morocco identification documents our info said he should. The riad bell boy insisted on making some calls before he was sure we were in safe hands.Our driver apparently had little time to be familiar with our route, or trip plans. The first three days, at times he asked locals for directions. In addition to the the picnic day mix-up mention earlier, on Day One we were concerned our driver was taking us to the regular desert camp. We finally asked him to pull over and insisted he look at our documents. He then seemed to understand we should be going to the location for the Deluxe Desert Camp we had paid extra for. We did then get to the correct place.The Bottom LineWhen we agreed to the Fes to Morocco 4 day trip, Liz Williams sent us a document outlining the trip and the conditions. It was stated in the documents we got a driver, not a guide. We did get what the conditions outlined: a driver and pre-booked accommodations, including dinner and breakfast. We have no complaints that Authentic Morocco met their contracted obligations, but that was all we got. We are experience travellers, who have been in a number of different cultures and travelling conditions. While we usually travel independently, occasionally in locations such as Ecuador, Tanzania, Cambodia, and recently Cuba, we have chosen a private or small-group tour company to learn as much as we can in a short time. We had hoped for this from Authentic Morocco, based on TA reviews and testimonials on their website. Unfortunately, during our 4 days with Authentic Morocco, we learned little more than what we could observe through the car windows as we were driven from accommodation to accommodation.We would recommend getting a company that provides a guide, if you are looking for more that private transportation and pre-booked accommodations. Or you could travel on your own. We spent an additional 11 days in Morocco, travelled on 1st class buses and trains. We journeyed from Tangiers to Fes, and after our tour from Marrakech to Essaouira and return to Tangier. We stayed in accommodations at least as good as the better of the Authentic Morocco places. We hired local guides. Overall, the total cost on our independent 11 days was about the same as the cost of the 4 days with Authentic Morocco. The difference being we learned FAR more about Morocco than while with Authentic Morocco."

Spent several days on foot in the Fes Medina, then drove to the desert (Merzouga / Erg Chebbi) with the same Authentic Morocco gentlemen (Hassan, our driver, as well as another Hassan, our licensed tour guide - this is required by law in Morocco). We were even taken to the home of Hassan our driver, and his Mother, sister in law, and niece and nephew were delighted with visitors. Berber culture is so warm and hospitable.We continued our driving tour and ended up in Marrakesh at the end of the trip. The owner, Liz Williams, was very helpful in arranging a tour to meet the time constraints we had (9 days). She was patient with me when I asked for a few recycles on the riads (hotels) she suggested. Liz is extremely conscientious and had every detail of our trip worked out. She is also the founder of a non-profit helping children in the region. You want to spend you money here. Very reasonable prices - you will not get a better deal.We were three women (two in our 40s and my 84 year old Mother In Law). We were comfortable and felt safe at all times. Trip of a lifetime. Highly recommend Authentic Morocco."

We thoroughly appreciated the care and attention to detail in both the planning of our holiday and also in looking after us while we were in Morocco. Highlights included the Riad Salama in Fes which is a gem of a place. Deeply civilised, an oasis built with flair, style and expertise. Lovely staff and delicious food. Michel went out of his way to advise us and to help arrange our stay with him.  Camel trekking and the deep desert camp - an amazing experience - the children loved the desert playing on the dunes, even our near teenager! The luxury camp is beautiful, we loved the way the tents were furnished. Abdul was a fantastic host. The children just didn't want to leave the desert. The staff at the Dar El Janoub were charming and the food good. But can we suggest they put a cover on the swimming pool at night as the water was freezing?!? Ali our driver was super. He looked after us so well, was great with the children, and a good safe driver. Attentive, thoughtful, professional. We seemed to be the only family with young children touring Morocco, which is a shame as it is a fantastic experience for them. Thanks to Authentic Morocco we have had such an adventure and experience as a family, way beyond our expectations or even hopes when we booked. The children went back to school still wide-eyed at their own experiences."

Liz and everyone at Authentic Morocco did a great job in providing us with a truly unique, fascinating, and effortless experience. My brother and his daughter had traveled to Morocco two years ago and he highly recommended Authentic Morocco to me. We had never been to Africa and really needed assistance. Liz selected great hotels, a perfect camel trek experience in the Sahara, and a great driver and guide (both named Hassan and both were extremely professional, nice, friendly and very helpful). She provided many options for us and everything worked our perfectly without a hitch. We went through Marrakech, Ait Bennadou and the High Atas Mountains, Dades Gorges, Fes, and Chefchouen - all were fantastic in their own way. Great experience."

            "review": "Amazing 6 day trip. I found Authentic Morocco via this site and thought I'd feed back my experience.I was amazed how quick Liz responded to my enquiry - we went back/fourth a few times about amount of days I could fit in and she made up an itinerary for what I asked - I really wanted to hit Fes, the Sahara, and also do a cooking class, and she proposed something that sounded great.Everything went amazingly smooth. The driver and guide I had were friendly and we got along really well over 4 days from Casablanca till Marrakesh. Fes blew my mind - what an amazing place, and the city guide was excellent. Be careful of the rug store there though, I suspect they trap and rip off a lot of tourists who don't realise you can barter down a lot or just walk out.The Sahara was amazing, and trekking through a camel through a sandstorm to a desert camp, cooking and eating a tagine in the dark and trekking back in the morning with a clear sunrise will be something I'll always remember. All the riads were very nice and the owners very friendly, food was often very good, and the same applies for the stops on the way. It's beneficial to know some basic French, so maybe good to brush up before heading over. Other than the cooking class, which was excellent, I didn't enjoy Marrakesh very much, at least after seeing Fes. So one recommendation would be to add more days in Fes as opposed to Marrakesh. It just didn't seem as friendly, didn't have that special \"wow\", the city guide was very average, and so on. Certainly worth the visit but also quite touristy and everything that comes with that is there.All in all an amazing experience, Liz runs a great outfit, and I'd certainly recommend this to everyone who plans to go to Morocco."

Given the number of days we had (6), she put together a great tour starting in Fes and ending in Marrakesh by way of the Sahara dessert. We thoroughly enjoyed our driver,Alli. He was knowlegeable, professional, and a courteous driver. We stayed in some great riads and Kasbah's along the way and the desert camp she recommended couldnt have been nicer. We had a short (25 min) camel ride to our camp via the sunset, and then enjoyed the candelight dinner and quietness of the desert. Both the sunset and sunrise over the dunes was spectacular.

They came to our riad, collected our luggage (there were eight of us) and got us loaded up into their SUVs. It was immediately apparent that they were all great at their jobs. As one reviewer mentioned, Mustapha, our guide, had an encyclopedic knowledge of Morocco. Some of the people in our group are \u201cfact finders\u201d so we knew that his information was indeed accurate. He was funny, too, so we spent a lot of time laughing as well as learning. Hassan and Mustapha, the drivers, noticed if we were missing our camera, purse, or whatever we normally carry and made sure we did not leave valuables behind. Our trip took us through the Atlas mountains, off road to visit a nomad family, and of course, into the desert on camels. A few comments about this FABULOUS adventure: 1) If you cannot climb stairs or walk on uneven terrain, then the trip we did would be very difficult for you. You should probably ask the ever-accommodating Liz Williams to tailor something around your needs. 2) The hotels ranged from fairly nice to clean but nothing fancy. There were no elevators in the hotels, but the guides and hotel staff got the bags to our rooms. 3) We did the overnight camel trek, and two of us had camels with extra bony humps. We managed to figure out where to sit. It was COLD at night (we went at the end of March 2014) so be prepared for the season. The blankets were warm enough but I had my jacket wrapped around my head to keep warm. Dinner was provided at the camp, but not breakfast, so bring a granola bar and some water for breakfast. I thought it was great fun and I do not like to camp. Remember, there is no running water, so bring some hand sanitizer. 4) The visit to the nomad family was wonderful but we went a long way on rough terrain with no bathrooms. Also, we did not know before we left that the nomads could use things like warm glove and jackets. We could easily have brought some things with us. Ask Liz what is appropriate.As with all tours, we stopped at several shops to buy local items, but I was happy with our purchases. One place shipped items so I sent a couple of larger items by mail and received them about three weeks after our tour. There were so many beautiful, handcrafted things to buy in Morocco. Next time I will plan my luggage better. Our group ranged in age from 50s to 70s, and we all were able to do the trip without any problem. We REALLY enjoyed our tour with Authentic Morocco and all of us would highly recommend them."

She was very, very thorough in arranging all the small details. She even showed up at one of the Riads we had booked halfway through our trip to see how everything was going! There's A LOT of driving to do in Morocco, and all the drivers she had given us were fantastic. All were extremely friendly and knowledgeable, had a lot of insight you could only get from someone who had lived in the country their entire lives.I highly recommend Authentic Morocco.

My review is a copy of a letter I sent to liz Williams....Just a quick note to thank you and your team for making our holiday in Morocco truly memorable! Both Mustafa and Omar were fantastic. Mustafa has a passion for history and a desire to learn and his English was fabulous. Omar was kind, and even though he doesn't speak a lot of English we were able to communicate through mustafa or by charades! He even invited us into his village home where we met his mother and cousins and had mint tea. The conditions for the Sahara were harsh, as it was hot and there was a sand storm. We felt the camel leader Amed, and Mohamed at the hotel really didn't communicate with us what was happening, or what to expect. The camp was spartan. The next morning was beautiful, still and cool. So, despite the above comments we all enjoyed the experience. It could have been better with more communication, and more of a welcome! ( perhaps a woman's touch ? )The hotels were all delightful, and great choices. We certainly feel we got to see many different aspects of Morocco and thoroughly enjoyed it.Again we can't express our gratitude enough to Mustafa and Omar who really went beyond their duty to make our time with them special.Thanks Liz, we really appreciate all the help you gave us formulating the itinerary Sent from my iPad"

My family and I recently returned from a tour of Morocco organized by Liz Williams and operated by Authentic Morocco, and I must say that it was one of the best travel experiences we have ever had. During the months between when we booked the trip and when we touched down in Casablanca, we had built up very high expectations, in no small part due to the extremely high Trip Advisor reviews of Authentic Morocco. To make a long story short, all of our expectations were not only met but exceeded. Over the years we have been fortunate to travel around the world and visit many interesting places, but our time in Morocco was certainly one of the best trips we have ever taken. Not only because of the people and country itself, but because of the itinerary Liz set up for us and the guides she employed. Our main guide, Ilyas, and driver, Omar, were extremely professional and knowledgeable, and they did a wonderful job. Although we were in a very foreign land, they both made us feel like we were among family. They did not just simply explain the significance of every site we saw, but they were also eager to answer each and every question we had about Moroccan history and culture in general; no question or request was too small for them to answer or accommodate. Additionally, every local tour guide we had was great, and we especially appreciated our Rabat tour guide \u2013 Fadin. Finally, I must comment on Liz Williams herself - she was a real pleasure to deal with. I emailed her dozens of times with random questions and requests in the weeks before our trip, and she always responded to me in an almost unbelievably quick and detailed manner. Although I'm sure she was juggling many different tours and groups at the same time, I often felt as if she was my private travel agent because of the attention she gave my family and our questions. I will gladly recommend Liz and Authentic Morocco to anyone considering a Moroccan adventure."

She is a terrific job of selecting ideal accommodations that were beautiful, clean, well maintained, professional run etc.Also our city guides in Meknes and Fes were excellent.  We thoroughly enjoyed the camel trek into the desert and the overnight camp. Our only real down side was how discouraged we were to see so much litter in the desert and especially around the camp site. We took seriously and really agree with the point we read to bring out what you bring in and it was disheartening to see so much trash strewn about (toilet paper, tampon applicators, water and wine bottles, plastic bags).Overall we highly recommend Liz Williams and Authentic Morocco.

From the beginning Hassan and Mustapha were fantastic travel companions. They were both friendly, helpful, polite, and extremely accommodating to our requests. It was such a pleasure to spend time with them and learn so much about just a dramatically different and interesting culture. They were always prompt and very thoughtful . Mustapha always accompanied us to the riad where we were staying and made sure that we were properly settled before leaving us and always told us to call him if we needed anything. The added bonus is that both are also very funny and lots of fun to be with. The riads we stayed in exceeded our expectations. They were lovely, served great food, had very attentive and friendly staff and were well located. We couldn't have asked for more.  In short, we had an amazing tour of Morocco and highly recommend Authentic Morocco to anyone who plans a trip there."

We had both a driver and English-speaking guide (Hassan and Mustafa) and visited Rabat, Fes and Marrakesh, along with a lot of smaller cities and spent one night in the desert. We really enjoyed not being part of a group, but instead could get to know places more intimately. Mustafa and Hassan were very attentive and flexible about our interests and what we wanted to see. They didn't rush us anywhere and we weren't stuck on a tight timetable like the typical tours.Liz at Authentic Morocco was very responsive to my requests and worked with me to craft an itinerary that worked for my husband and I. We really loved the riads we stayed in. They were beautiful, very attentive staff, great food and close to everything. Overall, it was a fantastic trip and we highly recommend Authentic Morocco!"

Liz was so helpful in designing the excursion that we envisioned for our first trip to Morocco and the desert. Everything was perfect and our guides were so nice, helpful, accommodating and informative. I highly recommend sleeping in the desert with a nomadic Berber family--it was just my girlfriend and I and our guide with the Berber family and the enormous majestic sand dunes all around us. We trekked to the \"camp\" by camel, spent the hot part of the day under a tiny oasis of palm trees, and then climbed 45 minutes to the top of a biggest sand dune we could find for a spectacular sunset and a breathtaking panoramic view of the Sahara desert. I will never forget that day, and Liz made it happen. I highly recommend Authentic Morocco for your unforgettable visit to Morocco."

We dealt with Liz via email and she always responded so quickly and with all of the information I requested. Liz was fantastic throughout the entire tour, ensuring we had everything we needed, payment was smooth and easy and no email or question was ever a bother.We were picked up promptly on time and the tour started. We unfortunately had no guide on our first day due to his mother being in hospital - these things can't be helped. Our driver, Omar who spoke no Engligh was fantastic. He made sure we stopped at all of the right places to get great photos. He made sure we were looked after at lunch and meet our local guide at our stop. We were met by our guide on day two and the tour went on as planned. The accommodation that was booked was lovely - comfortable beds, large rooms and nice bathrooms.Our night in the desert was amazing - met by our local guide who took us in to the desert - cooked us dinner and made sure we were looked after.There is quite a lot of driving - but this is to be expected and is very clear in the itinerary so shouldn't be a shock. At times, our guide was difficult to understand and it was difficult to have a conversation with him. This was communicated back to Liz after the tour. It was the first time this particular guide was used (as our original guide couldn't make it as his mother was in hospital).Liz followed up after the tour to ensure everything was to our standards.I would recommend using Authentic Morocco - from beginning to end, it was a pleasure dealing with Liz."

Every detail was coordinated flawlessly, making the drive time seem like nothing, while showing us all of the beauty and hospitality of this wonderful country.Liz worked within the budget that we set up for the beginning and incorporated some of the most beautiful hotels we have ever seen. Our guides, especially Mustapha and Hirchim, made this trip. They were incredibly friendly, knowledgable, and warm to our children (ages 5 and 10). And it was uniquely authentic. In one town, we were stopping for lunch, but as we drove in, we passed all of the other tour busses and 4x4s parked at the same big restaurant, took a left and enjoyed a private lunch in a home. Wow.I would (and have) recommend Authentic Morocco to anyone who will listen. It is the way to see this country."

Chez Pierre was delightful and the food delicious and a nice change of pace. The camel ride and tent stay was amazing! It was far more than we expected.

The extra day really helped the two children (aged 10 and 8) - otherwise day 1 would be really long and you would miss the opportunity for lovely stops along the way. The 2 hotels we used (in Midelt and Skoura) were lovely, and our guide was terrific.

Liz was helpful in putting together the itinerary in order for us to have time to do the various activities we wanted, suggesting different options given the length of our trip. When we were actually on our trip I realized her concerns about length of time to travel to different places because the posted distance often seemed to take longer to drive than one would surmise given the posted speed limit that our driver would be going. Our camel trip was touristy (I am not sure how this sort of thing isn't a little kitschy) yet still loads of fun, and we loved watching the sun both set and rise over the dunes. While our driver spoke Arabic and French but no English, our guide spoke English passably, and both were interested in showing us things about the local culture and places. For example, we wanted to learn how to cook tagine, and our guide and driver both helped us to do so over a portable gas stove along the M'Gouna River with meat bought from a local butcher and vegetables, spices and a tagine from the local market. We stated up front we were not interested in shopping and were not steered into any shops. Our guide and driver were courteous, prompt and approachable. Our guide sought feedback often to assist with planning for the next day based on our itinerary. We learned a lot and had fun. Thanks for a great trip!"

We were looking for a driver and car for the majority of our tour in Morocco (about 10 days), that was reasonable. Authentic Morocco was all of that and more.My first and main contact was with Liz Williams, the manager. She was timely and responsive to all of my inquiries and also offered helpful and candid suggestions (eg. is it worth visiting the Tin Mal Mosque? --- No! Unless you want to add 4 hours to your journey - the photographer side of me is still kicking myself for not doing it, but the rest of my body and my wife are thanking me for not having had to sit through a longer car ride).The price that she quoted I thought was very reasonable for what we were asking for.All of the accommodations that were booked were excellent, and we had absolutely no qualms with any of them. They met or exceeded our expectations. For the first part of our trip (Fes to the desert to Marrakech), we had Ali as our driver/guide. He was friendly, punctual, knowledgeable, spoke very good English, accommodating to any requests that we had (eg. stop here for a picture, bathroom stop etc.), and a safe driver (the car was also clean). After Marrakech (Marrakech to Tiznit), we had a combination of a driver (non English Speaking) and a guide (Englsh Speaking): Mustapha and Mustapha. While I would have preferred to have had Ali throughout, both Mustapha and Mustapha were very good also. (I think that the change was done due to scheduling and due to the knowledge/expertise of different guides in different areas of Morocco).I would happily recommend them to anyone looking for a travel company in Morocco.We traveled in Morocco with Authentic Morocco from approximately Feb 17-26, 2014."

EVERYTHING you planned and all of your staff were outstanding. From the moment I arrived at my first hotel until I left Ali I was in the best of care. Each guest house was outstanding. Because of spending several days in Fes I was able to enjoy the home and staff to the point where I felt like family. I was able to join in conversations in the evening, from the cooks to the house staff I was able to enjoy what felt like genuine love and laughter. While not everyone would enjoy such fellowship, I must say traveling alone, I enjoy the opportunity to meet new friends and have joyous conversation. Each tour guide went out of their way to give me amble time to enjoy each site and yet provide guidance when it was time to move on. I found it most interesting that one guest house could recommend another and I certainly enjoyed each guest house where I lodged. In terms of Ali, I could not have had a better guide. I have been blessed to have traveled in many countries with many guides and by far, Ali was one of the best, most helpful and attentive guides I have ever enjoyed. Being alone on the tour certainly enables me to have a closer relationship than some may be able to enjoy but Ali clearly learned what was important to me, would recommend places for photography, NEVER rushed me(which has happened on some tours) and in general made me laugh a great deal. I found Ali to be a great friend. In all of my ramblings, I would simply say what your other reviews have said, You and your team ARE THE BEST. Thank you for making my first visit to Morocco and outstanding experience. I hope I will one day enjoy a different part of the country.blessings to you in all you do.

They arranged a 3 day visit to the deep Sahara, walking tours in Marrakech and Fes and a return trip by car from Fes to Marrakech.The entire organisation of the trip was excellent. As nearly all reviewers have noted, Liz Williams did an outstanding job on answering all questions, making recommendations and general advice. All the local staff we met were professional and competent. A special mention for Adil (our driver) who was outstanding on some very hair raising and long drives, and Mustapha (our guide) who, besides being charming, had an absolutely encyclopaedic knowledge of his country. There wasn't a single question we fired at him that he couldn't answer. We would also like to thank Bakkar, our camel guide, for all his assistance in the deep Sahara. We are specially grateful to Liz for organising a car back from Fes to Marrakech at very short notice. We had meant to take the train but my husband fell ill and we had to unexpectedly hire a car and driver. We made a single phone call to Liz and a few emails later, it was arranged. Again, we were provided with a Toyota Land Cruiser and a great driver. It must have been arranged under difficult circumstances as there was a film festival on-going in Marrakech and our driver said that transport vehicles were scarce. It was great service. We would also like to comment on 2 very special aspects of the company not generally noted in the reviews. First, this is a company with a social conscience. The Children of the Sahara a foundation established by the company raises funds for project and programs for the nomadic Berber children. Mustapha explained some of the fund raising efforts undertaken and highly commendable projects supported. Second, it is a company run with integrity. When initially organising the tour, we asked Liz for a recommendation on hiring a car and driver through the company or taking the train back from Fes to Marrakech. Rather than choosing the first option which would have benefited her company, she recommended the train at a fraction of the cost. In a highly competitive travel industry, such advice deserves a lot of respect. We hope to return to Morocco again sometime in the future. All our travel arrangements will, of course, be done by Authentic Morocco. We have no hesitation in recommending this exceeptional company to all fellow travellers."

The hotels and riads and casbah we stayed at were a wonderful part of the experience. Liz of Authentic Morocco was always available by email and phone and thoughtfully answered questions and adjusted our trip if we needed to make a change. For instance, when I realized how much of a role bread plays in the diet, I wrote Liz and asked for suggestions for my gluten allergy. She promptly notified all the places we were staying and thought of strategies for me to supplement my diet. We couldn't be happier with this organization."

All our queries were answered promptly by Liz who has a wealth of knowledge about all aspects of travelling in Morocco. Our guide Mustapha was knowledgeable and personable and our driver Anwar was a friendly and very safe driver. Two cities that you should not miss are Chefchaouen and Fes. Meknes, the old imperial city often overlooked, has several wonderful sites and is worth a visit. We like seeing vanishing cultures so our camel trek and camping in L'Erg Chebbi dunes with the Berber Nomads,as well as visiting Berber Villages in the High Atlas, were great experiences. Many of the places in the High Atlas we had all to ourselves!"

This was a one day tour and it was great.. the driver Ibrahim picked us up early from our Riad and he spoke good English (which was a big plus as we don't speak Berber!). From the start he made us feel very welcome.. he also made us laugh a lot and engaged all of the family (6 of us!)The van was new and was really comfortable (I was expecting a truck!) and it had air con.. as it was nearly 40c on the day, this was much needed! Maybe more importantly, we felt safe with the driver (a big plus for anyone who knows the roads there!)Ibrahim checked in with us during the trip to make sure we were all OK and he was happy to stop for us to take photographs.. he was also very informative about the sites and the region. I know it sounds cheesy - but the trip was the highlight of our holiday !"

We were a group of 4 adults and 2 kids (ages 9 and 11) and spent 7 nights in Morocco. She was polite, patient and offered some really good advice, which could only come from experience. I felt that together we were able to tailor an itinerary that was perfect for us. And for that kind of service \u2013 the price was right!The trip itself was wonderful. We couldn't have imagined a more perfect trip. Omar was great - he was patient with us, even with our numerous questions and stops for shopping. All the riads we stayed in were fabulous - small, family owned and gave us a real taste of Morocco. The deep desert camp in Erb Chebbi was such a surreal experience that will stay with all of us forever - it's highly recommended. We met lots of great people, ate some really good food and experienced a trip of a lifetime. We would not have had the same experience on our own, without the services of Authentic Morocco.

If we ever do, we will definitely be contacting Authentic Morocco to help us arrange our next visit."

I had the chance to meet her twice and she is so gentle you think she's a distant relative that you do like, but you don't see very often. We visited more than 4 cities in 8 days and had no relevant problems at all. All the transfers were on time (except the train we lost due to Marrakech trafficc), all the local people (driver, guides etc) were kind and collaborative. Some minor problems that I related to Liz (and I'm sure she is working hard on that) included: a very bad restaurant indicated by his guide on Meknes and a guide in Fes that was a bit \"pushy\". Overall, if you do business with Liz and her Authentic Morocco, we'll be in very good hands. Just have fun in Morocco!! (and DO consider Liz's tips about hotels and restaurants!!)"

Yet in Fez we spent the first day with a guide provided by Authentic Morocco who was marvellous. A two or three hour tour turned into nearly six. He, and the two guides/drivers, were all a real pleasure to be with. We learned so much about the Berbers and their history. On travel days we asked to stop a lot. I shot about 2,400 pictures. At one point we stopped near a shepherd who was quite happy to let me see what he was up to - even posed for some great pictures. Liz did a great job with our itinerary. The riads were terrific.

            "review": "Authentic Morocco Tours = Authentic Experiences. I have never taken a tour and usually don\u2019t engage guides but happened upon Liz Williams from Authentic Morocco and had the time of my life.Before arriving in Morocco I raised money to drive a micro-financing project for rural Berber women. The project provides goats and is supporting the women in setting up a community based project producing cheese and thereby providing them with a sustainable income. I did this with the help of Liz Williams, a founding member of Children of Sahara, a Foundation that cuts out all the middlemen so that there is no money wasted - that is, we bought the goats ourselves and delivered them directly to the women in the village. Liz Williams is also the brainchild of Authentic Morocco, a private tour operator in Morocco, so we were able to merge the two experiences into one - contributing to the local community as we travelled through the south of Morocco.I was raptured by the experience - not just with Liz\u2019s commitment to the Berber women, which is so commendable in itself, but also by the opportunity to contribute and experience aspects or the Moroccan culture not typically available to tourists.Liz and her wonderful English speaking driver Ali collected us in their new Land Cruiser. From the moment we took off there were zillions of lost photo opportunities as we travelled through extraordinarily beautiful places to visit a jumble of goat farms. Over two days we consumed enormous amounts of compulsory sweet mint tea, on which all consummate negotiations are based, whilst listening to an endless stream of good-natured haggling. Finally, with the goats purchased, we hired a van and made our way to the village where the women were waiting. The women agreed to give the first female kid back to the Foundation so that it can be allocated to another woman on the waiting list and thus the project unfolds. By way of thanks we were fed a wonderful tagine lunch and each presented with a 2 kilo bag of the freshest, sweetest almonds I have ever tasted.With the leftover money we purchased basic groceries such as sugar, tea, soap, rice etc and set out in search of nomad families to provide them with some winter-sustaining dry goods. We drove through the Dades Gorge into undulating hills of wild thyme passing only the occasional shepherd and his flock. Eventually, we came across a Berber nomad family living in their brown wool tent in the mountains.  At home were just three children - 9 and 7 year old boys who were caring for their 1 year old brother whilst grandma and mother were foraging and herding their goats. The children wore dirty, ill-fitted clothes riddled with holes and offered us to share their small tent that was open to the elements. Goats and chickens wandered in and out and the hordes of rubbish substituted for seating.With great pride (and some curiosity) the boys graciously washed glasses with tepid water from a bowl and made us tea on a campfire inside the tent. We played and chatted until Grandma arrived with a load of grass for the goats and wood for the fire. She thanked us for the groceries and asked if we would return with winter shoes and clothes for the children. She was lovely and watching her gentle and loving interactions with the children was very moving.The experience was truly remarkable and reminded us of how resilient people can be when living in abject poverty and conversely how spoiled we are in the Western world. I now try to wake up with a smile on my face each morning and remember how lucky I am.

He stopped for our million photos, told us bits and pieces about the countryside, the history, the people, the way of life and so on.

We found them online and contacted the owner in London and all was handled through her. We booked a private vehicle and driver. It turned out we had a driver and a guide which made for crowded and uncomfortable conditions for the three of us (myself, spouse, and adult daughter) in the backseat for 3 full days of driving. We had thought there would only be two of us in the backseat and one in the front. If you have a choice - we didn't know until they picked us up and it was too late to do anything about it - only two to the backseat - the trip is too long and rigorous to be so uncomfortable. She made all arrangements for lodging and we paid through a wire transfer prior to our arrival (funds were held in escrow until our trip was completed). Our guide spoke excellent English and was full of information about all of the sites we were seeing along the way. It was a good experience, but I might reconsider spending so much time driving - though we got to see the Sahara in all its blowing glory, had a camel ride, saw nomadic peoples, and Ait Ben Haddou. I thought about it many times since our return home and can't figure out any better way to do it. There isn't much to do out there and I wouldn't have wanted to spend any more time along the way. Planes would help but I couldn't find any to get us there or back."

We were unfamiliar with Morocco and elected to use Authentic Morocco. From the beginning Liz Williams was very patient with us, helping us to design a tour that met our needs. Once we arrived in Morocco, the staff was superb. Even though my wife's luggage didn't arrive and we were somewhat perplexed how to handle the situation, the station agent for Authentic Morocco assured us that he would handle the problem, and within 24 hours, our bags arrived. He picked us up after our first day tour and took us to the airport for our bags. Although we may have been able to recover our bags, his calm demeanor certainly took the edge off our concerns. The tour guides were superb, providing excellent advice and always interested in making this exotic country a tourist delight. Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer. Definitely going back."

We went on a tour to the Atlas Mountains and the tour was fantastic, we had a brilliant english speaking guide who answered all of our crazy questions regarding not only the Atlas Mountains and the Berber people but everything about the culture of Morocco to their school system, Health care, etc.The highlight of the tour was lunch in a Berber Village. We saw all the other tour companies stop at the same restaurant, which maybe was fine, but we were fortunate enough to actually go into a Berber family home, where the grandmother and granddaughter made the meal and honestly it was so authentic and lovely and totally amazing, truthfully it beat any five restaurant we ate at during our holiday. Not to be forgotten the lady that runs Authentic Morocco is amazing and professional and will help you with any problems or questions that may arise. We will definaly use this company in the future. Thank You!"

            "review": "An Amazing Adventure!. My wife and I are independent travelers who typically book our own airfare, hotels, ground transportation, meals, etc. We generally only use tours in places where we need vehicular ground transport and the local knowledge of an experienced guide. Liz Williams at Authentic Morocco immediately illustrated her ability to work with independent travelers by providing us a customized quote including a detailed itinerary for a 3 day trek from Fes to Erg Chebbi dunes, ending in Marrakesh. She was always prompt, consistent, professional, and thorough in her responses and given the financial backing and escrow service her company uses, gave us the piece of mind when paying a company overseas money up front to guarantee our reservation. EVERYTHING, went without a hitch. The professional guide, Ali, met us at our Riad in Fes precisely on time and was courteous and friendly. He was a native of the desert we were traveling through and had vast local knowledge, including details I asked about (and later verified online...since I'm a buff for random information on places I've visited.) The camel trek in Erg Chebbi must be experienced to be believed. Liz's description of the experience was spot on, and the overnight trek is definitely for those with an adventurous spirit. My wife and I loved it. Another highlight was staying at Dar Panorama in Skoura with the family of Mr Aziz and his son Ackmed...who were two of the nicest people you will ever meet on this earth. Our guide, Ali, also proved to be MAJORLY resourceful in quickly charting an off-road route around a small mountain range when the only road through the area was closed down due to local political protest. It was something out of Indiana Jones driving off piste in a 4 wheel drive vehicle through a dry riverbed and then through some small desert mountains and back to the main road. Once in a lifetime experience. Ali took it in stride barely fazed by the situation. All in all Authentic Morocco delivered, beyond expectation, an experience that was professional, full of adventure, local flair and culture, financially water-tight, prompt, safe, and incredibly prepared to deal with the trials and tribulations of the back-country of a developing nation. I HIGHLY recommend this experience to independent, open minded travelers looking for adventure and a once in a lifetime experience!"

Our guide, Naim, was wonderful. -very patient and open to sharing a lot of insighful information about his native culture. The drive through rural Morocco was beautiful and fun; we had lunch in a local home, saw beautiful landscapes, and stayed in an old, quiet guesthouse one of the nights. The camel tour itself, with the Blue Man Group, was wonderful. The deep red Saharan sands were gorgeous, and it was surreal to be underneath so many stars that night. We sat around a campfire with a few other travelers and played drums, told jokes/stories, and had a really incredible time. It was a very unique, and unforgettable, experience."

Our driver was very proffesional and careful, which is essential on the hair pin bends! If you go on to the berber village of Telout - and its very worthwhile , do take up the offer of lunch provided by a berber family - they have a large airy room where they serve it and its a welcome break from the heat and driving, as well as being delicious - we asked for vegetarian and were served morrocan salad, vegetable couscous and vegetable tagine - both plain, simple and delicious - followed by fresh fruit and dates. The Kasbah el Glaoui is a magnificent palace slowly crumbling away at the edges, but the richness of the interiors still remain in some of the rooms, a total contrast to the village beyond its walls. We had a friendly, knowledgeable guide and all four of us had a really great day. Its a long trip but well worth it, and we would highly recommend authentic morocco - nice to have a good vehicle, not a saloon car. We left at 7 am and weren't back till 6pm, take sunscreen and comfy shoes as well as lots of water!"

Lots of stops for photos, buying fossils from roadside stalls and mint tea. Very impressive scenery and final few miles off road so Landcruiser came into its own. Onto Telouet where we had a really tasty lunch in a Berber home and then a very intersting tour round the castle with the Authentic Morocco guide. Away for over 10 hours but with lots of chances to witness real life in Morocco, fantastic scenery and plenty of stops the day flew by.

As a family, we were on a 5 week vacation, covering much of Europe and ending in Morocco. There are loads of tour companies promising unique Sahara dessert treks, but none as professional and helpful as Authentic Morocco. I sent an email to several companies, and Liz was very fast to respond.Liz worked with us to create a perfect itinerary for us that would start in Fes and end in Marrakech over 4 days. Everything ran like clock work. I was thankful that she gave us:- a detailed itinerary- tipping guides- packing guidesWe had a guide and a driver, both were very nice and very knowledgeable. Our car was a toyota 4 runner, which is a good choice for this much driving. Do keep in mind though, that there will be 3 adults across the back seat if you have a guide & a driver.The highlight of the trip was a camel trek out into the Sahara, with a berber camel guide to sleep in a berber camp. Riding a camel is a bit of an adventure, but you really need to do it! The camp is very basic & authentic (carry in your own water, no facilities, etc) but well worth it. Children and drum players came to our camp to sing and entertain - and sunrise was awesome. Our kids did some sand boarding (very tiring) and all in all it was a great adventure. I am not a camper, but really glad I did this!Packing Hint: Pack a small flashlight that you can wear around your neck (Brookstone makes them), and bring frozen waters.All in all, Morocco is a very cool destination. But I would NOT do it without a trusted bonded guide. Authentic Morocco is exactly that. We even made a few adjustments along the way - & it was no problem. Thank you Liz!"

            "review": "Brilliant from start to finish - Authentic Morocco is the way to go.. I visited Morocco last month with a group of friends (two guys and two girls). As twenty somethings, we were looking for a change from the usual raucous city and beach holidays, and were keen to catch a glimpse of a completely new culture. We decided to use a tour company to have better piece of mind and to avoid wasting precious time searching around for deals having arrived in Marrakesh. It was the right choice. Liz at Authentic Morocco was a great help right from the start, bending over backwards to put together a tailor made three day trip for us. We gave her our preferences and she pieced together a fantastic itinerary.Both hostels were fantastic. One was in Essaouira and had a beautiful roof terrace for breakfast. The rooms were very spacious and clean and the French owner very friendly (though she couldn't quite believe that two English lads were heading out for evening coffee rather than for a drinking session). One thing to note. The hostel is not actually overlooking the beach, as the photos seem to imply, but this wasn't an issue in the end. It was only a short walk to the beach and a stroll through the old town was never boring. The driver we had, Kalid, was very friendly and helpful, not at all sleazy. Not quite sure what the previous reviewer was going on about. He/she must have got out on the wrong side of the bed. My highlight was fist pumping to one of Kalid's 'disco CDs' for a good hour and a half. Rock hard, ride free! We gave him a small tip at the end of the trip (we all work in publishing!) and never felt obliged to do this.The B&B at Imlil was incredible. Perfect choice Liz! The staff were amazingly welcoming and treated us to mint tea and biscuits on arrival. The evening meal was the best food we had in Morocco and the surrounding mountains were very tranquil and good for body and mind. Though we didn't pack quite the right equipment, the half-day trek was also very enjoyable. Our guide, Rashid, was a legend and very chatty. He is young, so we had a lot in common. But note to other travellers ... bring good shoes. My feet were dead after four hours walking in Nike trainers. Titus!All in all, we were very pleased with Authentic Morocco and would not hesitate in recommending them! Thanks guys.Cheers,Chris"

Everything went like clockwork. Mohamed our driver could not have been more helpful. It was great to have someone who spoke Arabic, Berber, French and English and could act as our interpreter, enabling us to talk to people we would otherwise have been unable to communicate with. We feel we got a better understanding of Morocco as a result. Hamid our camel driver was also a really nice guy, and we had an interesting evening in the desert chatting with him in our broken French. It was particularly good to get off the beaten track and see parts of the country that so few tourists reach. We were particularly keen to visit a nomad family and a rural school, and this was all arranged for us. Everyone we met was friendly, helpful and hospitable and we felt completely safe. We have spent quite a lot of time travelling in Central America and you have to be very careful all the time to avoid your personal possessions being stolen or worse, whereas in Morocco we felt safe at all times of the day or night - safer than in London!Sally and David from Devon and Paul and Pauline from London."

The camel trek is a must (lifechanging), meeting with Berber families and sharing stories was a blessing, the local guides were informative and fun. The monkeys in the cedar forest were adorable. The Women's cooperative who makes the Argon oil products was fascinating. The World Heritage Roman Ruins site is very important and Meknes was quite magical. Everyone that Authentic Morocco chooses to do business with seems ethical and trustworthy, though you do need to learn how to haggle...it's part of the culture! Best trip ever!!!"

We had our reservations as we have always enjoyed the freedom of dictating our own itinerary but having completed the trek we would have no hesitation in recommending Authentic Morocco as a tour operator.The trek was excellent and we had a very good guide - Personable, intelligent, knowledgable and attentive without ever being overbearing. There was nothing we could fault him on - He made a real effort and we didn't want for anything. His English is near perfect which is just as well as our Berber and Arabic are ropey at best (However - Insha'Allah - They did improve over the trek). The camp sites (Tachddirt & Oukaimeden) were perfectly adequate as was the guest house in Timichi - We were comfortable and as this was our first guided trek we frankly felt spoilt - We are used to heavy bags and a guidebook/map so a team of three to look after us both was a luxury! As an example of the consideration we were afforded - Our guide arranged for us to have lunch in a restaurant in Setti Fatma when we arrived instead of a picnic by the river as it had rained on-and-off the previous day and he was concerned about flash-flooding and the 1995 disaster there - A classy move that may have gone unnoticed except we had read about the '95 event and had been caught by an electrical/hail storm just over the pass of Tizi n'Ouhattar the previous day which feeds into the Ourika valley.Our cook/muleteers were both really nice guys and the food was excellent (We continually felt guilty in turning food away as we couldn't eat it all!). There were plenty of snacks and tea to compliment the meals (We drink a lot of tea) and there was nothing more we could have asked for. It was really special to be spend time with local people in their own back-yard so to speak - It never ceases to please/amaze us how attitudes, lifestyle and solutions to life in high altitude areas are similar across the globe - It is a beautiful thing and it is reflected in the characters of the people who live there.The countryside itself was a bit of a revelation - We expected the transition from lowland through Alpine to a more scrubby high altitude landscape and back but we did not expect the luscious meadows of wild flowers and orchids around Oukaimeden. This was a special treat as I am a qualified Ecologist and my wife a nature enthusiast - We had read there were orchids and flowers but we were really impressed by the bounty on show - Our hayfever kicked in and we happily spent hours sneezing through the fields taking hundreds of photos - We were so impressed. The walking was good - Just enough each day to allow for unforseen events (The electric/hail storm which blew in just over the pass of Tizi n'Ouhattar which meant we had to hunker down in a local home for a few hours before heading to Timichi for the night). By necessity we walked on roads at some points which wasn't very 'Romantic' but the views were so good we didn't notice the tarmac.In a word - Faultless. In some other words - Great value. The only thing we could have wanted for was more information on natural history / ecology but we knew this wasn't a specialist tour and we hadn't pointed out we were nature-geeks before hand so we accepted that we were asking a lot in this regard. To exemplify our satisfaction we left a generous tip for our three man team and had no hesitation in doing so.We would recommend Authentic Morocco to anybody thinking of arranging a tour in Morocco. From the initial tentative communications by email to arranging the detail of the tour to the actual tour itself everything has been faultless. All correspondence has been prompt, informative and clear and the physical tour was of a high standard, exceeding our expectations. We often didn't notice we were on a tour, we just felt like we were trekking independently with some new friends who didn't mind carrying bags, setting-up camp, cooking, cleaning and having a chat - That was priceless to us. We are sure we will return to Morocco at some point in the future and we will not hesitate to book another tour with Authentic Morocco."

It was a packed week with a tight schedule to visit places like Meknes, Fes, Volubilis, Marrakesch, Thorda Gorge, Dades Gorge, A\u00eft Ben Haddo and offcourse a night in the desert was on our wish list too. Authentic Marocco made this possibel fo us. After contacting them by e-mail, I received a quick response back that they would be able to arrange a camel trek that met our schedule. The price was reasonable. Maybe about 30Euro's more expensive, if you were to go to Merzouga and find a local camel driver there... With the possibility they are all booked, or you might have to wait till the next day. I paid a small deposit by Credit Card and paid the rest after meeting up with our camel driver in Marocco. Authentic Marocco had arranged to meet our guide in an easy to find location on the way to Merzouga. Because we were coming from Fes, the drive was long but Beautiful, with some amazing views of teh High Atlas mountains. The guide Yusef drove with us through the rugged terain to the Riad on the edge of the dessert. where we got a room to change if we wanted and store our belongings. We were treated to a nice cup of tea and got acquainted with our dromedaries, Bob Marley and Jimmy Hendrix, who would be our taxies into the desert. The weather was amazing.. though I did forget to put sun protector on my legs and one side of my calf got burned on the way out to the camp.Here we had another Moroccan tea.. and when the sun was setting lower a bit and the temperature was getting a bit better to handle, we climbed to the top of a 600ft sand dune... wow.Local dinner was prepared by our chef Ali, who we had the pleasure of being invited to his Tent as well to meet his wife and son... with another cup of tea. The night was short... for those who want to see sun rise... and back on the backs of Bob and Jimmy to the hotel for Breakfast and a well appreciated shower... :)I would recommend Authentic Marocco to anyone who wants to experiance a great Desert Trek. .

There is great diversity and history in the country that makes Morocco a terrific place to visit. Our driver, Mohammed, was a local Moroccan native who lives in Marrakech and was a complete delight. He was very consciencious, always a gentleman, and gave us important insights into the country. We were very comfortable with him and he clearly valued our safety and enjoyment as his primary goal.. I should also mention that he told us he was paid full-time by Authentic Morocco and very much enjoyed working for the company. During the 2 weeks, we visited maybe 3 shops at his suggestion but never received any pressure to buy anything. These were first rate stores that would have been good places to purchase items had we been interested. I could not imagine a better driver with higher integrity, greater commitment to our safety and enjoyment and a wonderful representative of his country. Finally, the guides provided by Authentic Morocco at the imperial cities that we visited were all first rate. Their English was excellent, they were well versed in history, and they provided very interesting tours.Our 2 week trip to Morocco is part of a 9-month international travel adventure that is currently in its third month. We have visited 5 other countries and our Morocco experience has been right there at the top. I should also mention that Liz at Authentic Morocco provided us with excellent advice in planning this trip.

I am in the midst of the most wonderful trip I have ever taken in my 50 + years of life and I owe it all to Liz Williams, and her local partner Abdulla, and the local general manager, Irissa. We arrived into Rabat after a very long day from Portland Oregon to Chicago to Paris and finally Rabat. We were greeted by Irissa who took us to the wonderful Vllla Mandarine where we were able to get some badly needed rest. The next day, we met up w/a phenomenal local guide who has lived his entire life in Rabat. We saw the Roman Ruins, the King's Palace, a military training center, the final resting spot of a several kings, and an incredible neighborhood that splits Rabat from Sale. It was a remarkable tour. Once the 3 hour or so tour concluded, we traveled in a very nice Land Cruiser to Fes, a journey that took a little less than 3 hours. I am traveling w/my wife, our two kids, aged 20 and 16 and for more than 3 weeks so we have a lot of luggage. The Land Cruiser is a perfect car for this journey. It comfortably seats all of us and our luggage and has great big windows so everyone can see. Fes was truly unbelievable. We stayed at the wonderful 14 room riad, the Palais Amani and had an excellent tour of a medina by a guide who was born and raised in the Medina. One needs such a guide as the medina has 9400 streets most of which dead end. From there, a long car trip to the Sahara Dunes which had many highlights but the camel ride at sunrise was particularly sublime. We stayed at a very nice Xaluca property in Merzouga and had the place pretty much to ourselves. It literally sits on the Dunes' line and you can walk a few hundred yards to be amidst the dunes. Our trustworthy, honorable and thoroughly decent driver and the general manager of the company-which runs as many as 15 different, yet concurrent custom trips was born and raised in the desert and was therefore in a position to take us to see a wonderful community of local musicians that spanned 4 generations, and then off road to see a Nomad family in their \"residence\" where the family, who has nothing, offered us bread and olive oil and tea and watermelon and warm welcomes. Both were nothing short of life affirming experiences. Next up, the amazing village of Bourdain Dunes. Another stay at a Xaluca property, this one called Xaluca Dunes that was terrifically situated w/an expansive view over the village and the very fertile valley that lies at the foot of the village. I am writing this from the truly amazing Riad Kniaz which is over the top beautiful, w/phenomenal service. We will be here 3 nights and then we have one night in a High Atlas village and two on the Atlantic Coast before we return to Rabat for our return flight to Paris. To this moment, EVERYTHING has been absolutely first rate. The accommodations, the meals, the guides, the entire itinerary, for which I thank Liz Williams has been other worldly and made for a phenomenal trip. I would recommend Liz and her very hard working people to friends and family alike. One final thought: I read the recently posted remarks of a person named Adelaide. I suspect she was having a bad day when she wrote it. I have a problem w/people who say things like \"I heard that XYZ\" because it shows their personal lack of information. I can tell you that what Adelaide says she \"heard\" is utter nonsense. Idrissa has been w/Authentic Morocco for 3 years. This is not a wealthy country but he makes a decent living. So decent that he recruited two of his brothers to now work for Authentic Morocco as well. One does not hire their brothers to work for a company unless it is a great company to work for. Authentic Morocco is aptly named as it hires locals and pays them well and respects and honors their work and it shows in how the guides interact with their clients. Again, I would not hesitate to work with Authentic Morocco."

Every year we travel off the beaten track in the mountains and in the desert, we shoot from dawn till dusk and cover huge distances, and my clients always have numerous questions about Morocco, the Berbers, Islam, local culture and geography. Every year my clients comment on how the drivers from Authentic Morocco go beyond the call of duty to look after them, not only being informative, friendly and courteous, but also helping with luggage and even running down a mountainside in the dark, un-asked, to look for a lens cap that a client has accidentally dropped. Incidentally, we too have had last-minute birthday cakes to organise. If this is the kind of behaviour that, every year, prompts my clients to ask if they can tip their drivers, then so be it. Note, a tip is neither asked for nor expected, but of course gratefully accepted... and I personally do not have a problem with someone getting a tip if they have earned it! Note also that Authentic Morocco IS a local company, with an office in Marrakesh (who sent a representative to personally seek out one of my clients in the hotel she had booked independently, to ensure her safety on the day of the 2011 bomb), with Liz who (entirely sensibly I feel) coordinates itinerary planning and marketing from the UK.Over the last 7 years I have met many of the drivers and had extentsive dealings with both Liz and the office in Morocco, and would recommend the company to anyone."

I can not say the same about Authentic Morocco which I swore I would never use again. I would like to warn other travellers to consider carefully what they support in Morocco. This is not a local company and my driver was sleezy, scammed the whole trip and it appeared to me that the camel driver had not been properly paid and I ended up paying him. The sad thing is that I am writing this review partly in response to one lady who said how wonderful her driver 'Kalid' had been because he got her a cake for her birthday (sounds like the same manipulative driver I had - he got me a CD music disc!). I wonder how much the tip was she gave him at the end!!!!! The problem is that many drivers in these companies, from what I have been told, actually are not properly employed and this is an agreement they are happy to undertake because they know they can make big tips from the tourists hence the emphasis on the scamming. It is important to ensure that we as tourists do not indulge in this type of behaviour at our pleasure. We need to go into Morocco and be responsible and support the right kind of tourism and local good companies. And to top it off Authentic Morocco never addressed my concerns and the trip had to be paid in full at the start. Satisfaction definitely not guaranteed.No such experience with Maroc Expedition. I paid a small deposit. They followed me up with an email to check how things had gone. There was not one place my driver detoured without my permission and no shopping side scams.He was actually properly paid by his company and any tip I provided was additional to that income.The riads were good quality and I could check them beforehand. And most importantly for a woman I felt safe at all times and I was treated with respect. Thank you Maroc Expedition!"

Kalid was able to share with us what he knows about the area and about life in Morocco. THis was my first time taking such a small tour (me, my partner and our driver) and I was pleased that Kalid was excellent at being there when we needed him, anticipating our needs and also giving us our space. There is a lot of driving so, if you have time, I would do at least 5 days, and you probably will still wish you had more time. The desert trek was a highlight, but lots to see along the way. Information from head office pre and post trip was good and helpful. This trip was to celebrate a big birthday, we metioned this in passing and after dinner on my birthday a personalised cake appeared and, despite being the only guests at the kasbah, an impromptu party was assembled. We even had some berber dancing. Very sweet and a very nice touch!"

The staff we worked with to book our camel trek tour through the Sahara Desert was incredibly friendly, professional and punctual. Liz Williams was so patient and wonderful in helping us navigate a design a tour in a country we had never been to, offering sincere suggestions to enhance our experience. Our tour guide/driver, Driss, was by far one of THE highlights of our 3 day tour. Though there was a slight language barrier, we developed such a camaraderie with him. He was professional, attentive and incredibly accommodating. I traveled with another female friend to Morocco and we felt so safe and in such good hands travelling with Driss; he took great care of us and our well-being. The entire tour from start to finish was punctual and incredibly easy. All the folks we met that were part of the Authentic Morocco group had smiles on their faces and were genuinely happy to help make our experience memorable. I highly recommend using Authentic Morocco for all your tours through Morocco. My only recommendation is that you work with Authentic Morocco to try and ensure you and your tour guide/driver speak the same language."

We had a few cities and sites in our mind and hence, we sent our requests for private customised tour via email to different companies. Tenere Tours responded in a matter of minutes, with the full itinerary with other must-go sites that we have missed. The most importantly, they offered a great price! Rachid was very helpful and quick in answering questions. With his help, our application for Morocco Visa went well. We arrived at Marrakech Airport on the same day but different time (5 in the morning and 1 in the evening), yet Rachid and Ali went twice to pick us all up to our riad and helped us in settling down. With a skillful driver (Ali) and a hospitable tour guide (Rachid), we travelled in a really comfortable way on a mini van through Marrakesh, Essaouira, Ouarzazate, Merzouga, Arfoud, Fes and others. They would tell us stories and histories about the cities, stopping at different spots for nice panoramic views and photo-taking session, and sometimes throwing us with jokes. The whole journey was full of laughter and we got close really quickly. Something worth mentioning was that, they would celebrate the Islamic festival (Eid Al-Adha) on 12th of September, 2016, and because of this, we had the chance to explore a few authentic local markets that were really busy with people trying to get ready for their big festival, buying and selling goats, sheeps and other spices. The stop at the market on our way from Marrakech to Essaouira was quite random, but in my opinion was the best part of the trip!! Buzzing through the crowd, observing the locals' way of living, their culture, religion, food... EVERYTHING! That was AMAZING!!Throughout the journey, I was amazed by the various landscapes in Morocco. Dry land with cactus; ground with troves of marine fossils; mountains of different colour (red, brown or black); Sahara deserts with shrubs; national park with trees just like those in tropical country (My hometown: Malaysia!). Moroccan cuisine such as tagine, couscous, zaalouk, b'stilla, all tasted amazing! They are not spicy and hence, no worries. Their mint tea was refreshing and I think I am addicted to it (they called it Moroccan whiskey with zero alcohol, LOL!!) Rachid recommended us to local restaurants with tasty food at a reasonable price. He even helped us to bargain as we do have language barrier with the locals. The accommodation arranged by Rachid was brilliant. The staffs at the hotels and haimas were all helpful and warming, greeting us with smiles and always welcome us with their mint tea. Breakfasts were included and the hotels are all at the right spots, allowing us to walk around and explore the town by ourselves. The night in sahara was lively with their traditional musics, songs and board game. Rachid was a really responsible tour guide. When one of my friends fell sick in Sahara desert (probably due to motion sickness after riding the camel, or maybe because of the heat), he rushed to us, took good care of my friend, and stayed all night with us. His sincerity in making friends and his generosity show us the best side and also the beauty of Morocco. Once again, thanks a lot for the trip of a lifetime!!!!! We highly recommend this company to anyone.  Tips: - Travel in a larger group comes a better price. - Ask for permission if you would like to take photos of their stalls, or else you might end up being scolded."

He introduced us to our driver Ali, who was responsible for taking us to our sites throughout the country. Ali was super friendly, knowledgeable, generous and most importantly accommodating.

We went during Ramadan, and despite not eating/drinking anything for the entire day, Ali was always cheerful, helpful, knowledgeable and engaging. We got to learn so much more about the culture, history and traditions just by being with him for the entire tour. In addition, we met professional and certified tour guides in each major city (Marrakesh, Fez, even the dessert), who taught us a great deal and even bargained for us! Our two nights in the desert were unforgettable. We rode camels, drove over the duns, visited Berber and Bedouin families, enjoyed traditional Berber music under the desert ski and enjoyed incredible service. While on the road, we crossed paths with Rashid and a tourist from Chile. Rashid stop his car, came and greeted us and even the tourist got out of the car to say hello.

It was like we were traveling with a friend, which made the experience all the more fun and comfortable the entire time. Not to mention, Hassan is well versed in several languages, which makes him that much more approachable and capable of connecting with people from around the world. I think its not only impressive, but a huge asset for travelers who come from different places around the world.

He designed a trip to ensure we would experience pretty much everything this Country has to offer : mountains, desert, beaches, good food, music, chaotic cities, charming towns and very nice people. We were able to appreciate and learn about their culture, way of leaving, religion, history and food. We drove a little less of 2,500 kms for 10 days. Their 4x4 SUVs are in good condition and they know the roads very well. Roads are a mixed of good highways and more local roads. We were 3 adults, and as we had a driver & a guide the 3 of us had to share the back seat, this is something to consider depending on who is traveling. We travel during the month of Ramadan. 2 advantages: first, you get to see in deep how they live this month and the importance of the religion in their culture; also, I understand is a less \"touristy' time, so there is less congestion. The only downfall is that most of the good restaurants in the big cities are not open for lunch, and at night if you are an early bird (like we are), you have to wait after 8 pm to get served in many places. The only thing that I would do different, is maybe go a little more upscale in the hotels. In general they are decent and clean, good service and food, but having been there, I now think with a little more money is worth the upgrade. If you travel during the summer sunblock, sunglasses and a good hat is a must! We reached temperatures over 45 Celsius in the desert. Overall we had a great experience, and left Morocco feeling is a Country rich in culture and history, with very kind people that understand the important role that tourism plays in their economy. Both Rashid and Hassan were very attentive, punctual, organized. Always making sure we were having a great time! They are fun to travel with and very knowledgeable of their culture and Country."

Luckly, weeks before, 3 of my friends and i found a chance to visit Morocco in our final year summer vacation and we had planned to visit this mysterious country for so long and fortunately we found Tenere Local Tours as our priority. The tour took us for 6 days, we acrossed and visited the places from Marrakech to Sahara Desert and then to Fes. Although the date of the trip was not quite enough as we have other schedule to go after 29/5, Rachid Ait Khouya (The local tour guy from Tenere Tours) compressed the trip with keeping the most important attractiones for us. Also, he brought us to visit the local market that 4 of us were only Asian in there which was quite weired lol. Overall, high recommend for Tenere Tour if any of you visit Morcocco as the price and the quality of the service are so cheap and professional. Lastly,Thank you again Rachid Ait Khouya for treating us as your family members and thank you for all the memories in the trip. Hoping that we can meet you soon in the future, my friend. Leo"

And our trip via camel into the desert camp was probably the highlight. The camp was just fabulous with electricity, hot and cold running water, flushing toilets and a standup shower!

One difference is Tenere is a lot cheaper and I was worried there was something awry. Lucky we took the punt, we had an awesome time! Rachid was our host of a group of 11 guys and gals in their late 20s-late 30s (mostly Aussies) and we loved it. We started in Marrakech and made our way to the Sahara and back seeing the Atlas Mountains and a number of unesco sites on the way. My only criticism is that there is a fair amount of time on the road but that's no fault of the Tenere, it's just the way of the land. I am also unsure how different a 3 day vs 4 day (we did the 4 day) tour as we had mates do a 3 day and they did most of our highlights. Either way, the Sahara is phenomenal and not to be missed, definitely the highlight of Morocco. Rachid as a tour guide is hilarious too, couldnt ask for a better guide, definitely makes a difference."

It's truly unique, and the hospitality across the country is fantastic. Everyone was so nice!

Most of us are Bulgarians,but we have a Czech guy and a Swiss girl in the group as well. In this episode, we decide to go somewhere for New Year and spent a few days there. Fast forward a few episodes. We've had numerous arguments and debates about the dates, places, length of the trip and so on. We've settled for 3-5 days after the 3rd of January, and we're deciding mainly between Morocco and Russia. After final look at the offers we have, we choose Morocco. 8 of us are going, between the 3rd and the 7th. The agency-Tenere Tours Morocco. The guide-the main protagonist in the series-Rachid! And the second part of the TV season is like an ecranisation of \"One Thousand and One Nights\". Beautiful old cities and villages, busy markets, where you forge bargains with the merchants for their handcrafted treasures, places where movies like \"The Mummy\", \"Laurence of Arabia\", \"Gladiator\" and \"Babel\" were shot, \"Game of Thrones\" scenes as well, smiling and frienly people... At least two episodes have to be dedicated to the desert camp trip and the night spend there. Never have I seen so many stars n the sky, and the drum party organised by our hosts was mesmerising, pure magic! From the largest North African palm grove to the UNESCO cite of Ait Ben Haddou, from Marrakech to Sahara, this was a maginificent journey. And it wouldn't have been even close to this without Rachid and this agency. They knew all the best places, wanted us to see everything possible, while having fun at the same time. And we met iterally hundreds of people, who knew Rachid and greeted him warmly, made discounts for us and so on. The untainted luxury in the hotels and the desert camp was beyond our imagination, when we paid for the trip. We were often wondering how did we manage to get all of this so cheap. Grab warm clothes for the winter, and go for the adventure of your life! And we're already thinking about the second season of our much beloved \"Everybody Loves Rachid\" series! ^^"

From the start, our guide (Rachid) was extremely friendly, personable and always on hand to answer any queries we had. We were shown plenty of amazing sights and delights along the way, as well as spots off the beaten track that only a local would know. He made me see these places in a whole new light and reinvigorate my interest in destinations that I had visited already.One of the highlights for me was the trek into the Sahara desert on the camels and spending a night in a nomadic Berber camp watching the sunset and moon rising as well as singing and dancing around the camp fire well into the night! Rachid's jovial nature added a light-hearted mood to our tour experience which suited our group very well - he was so easy to get along with and was always there if we needed any assistance. He is multi-lingual and was happy to even let me practise my limited Spanish on him throughout the tour! :)Highly recommend Rachid and Tenere Tour Morocco to anyone wanting to gain a wonderful insight into an amazing country and its people, culture, food and lifestyle.

We met Ali from Tenere Tours in Marrakech and drove down to Ait Ben Haddou to meet up with Rachid in a private car. Rachid and Ali were not only excellent tour guides who were very knowledgeable about all aspects of Moroccan culture and destinations but they were also extremely easy and pleasant to be around. We instantly liked them both and felt like we could trust them. We wanted to get out of the cities and touristy areas and that is what we did! Rachid took us to his small Berber village in the middle of the desert and into other local market places and villages that really gave us a taste of real Moroccan life. After our tour was scheduled to end we asked Rachid if he could take us on for another 5 days as we really appreciated his knowledge of the country and trusted his taste. We highly recommend Rachid at Tenere Tours and really think he is the best guy for the job!"

            "review": "Morocco is the best choice!. I had to choose between Italy and Morocco for vacation. I chose Morocco and I don't regret it for one second. Mainly because Morocco and the Sahara were truly amazing experiences but it was also due to the tender love and care given by Tenere Tours. Usually, I'm not one for tours. I prefer to just go and explore on my own. I went ahead and booked the tour anyway, another decision well made. The tour guides picked up my group directly from the gate at the airport and off we went. Our primary tour guide, Rashid, was the best. A local of the entire region, he was able to point out and recommend the best places for everything, including points of interest, photo opportunities, and fabulous food. The guides were a blast, keeping the trip fun and exciting. They remained flexible by letting us stop anywhere we asked.In conclusion, Morocco is a wonderful place. Everywhere the tour took us to was great and a lot of fun. The hotels where awesome, the towns and markets are a portal to another world, and the mighty Sahara itself was grand. Tenere Tours, thank you for the wonderful memories, I can't wait to go back."

We went for almost five days, we went to a lot of places, one of my favorite ones was the dessert, sleeping in there was an incredible experience. You have the chance to meet so many people, people with a completely different way of thinking that it makes you start seeing live in a totally different way. Besides the beautiful places we met, the experience was completed with beautiful people such as Rachid and Hassan, I can't explain the amazing time we had together, we became friends in matter of days.There's something I can totally say. Wait for me, I'm coming back!"

Morocco is something that everyone should experience but having the right guides could make or break the experience. I am not one to typiclly hire a guide while on vacation but I've changed my mindset on that after our experience with Arenas 4x4. They personalized the tour in everyway to where we went and how long we needed at each stop. Everything from great food, cultural insights and the best jokes we are still telling.Thanks for an incredible expereince in the Sahara!"

            "review": "The ONLY way to see Morocco!. Morocco is a magical country full of great beauty, it's people are gracious and accommodating. Look no further than the crew at Tenere Tours Morocco for proof! Our amazing guide, Rachid, took us from Marrakech to the Sahara and back, not only stopping at all of our predetermined sites, but taking the time to share the hidden wonders as well. From ancient Casbahs and traditional, African cultural centers to Beduin tribes and local markets, we experienced things you won't read about in any guidebook. Things that would only have been possible with the assistance of an experienced and knowledgeable guide. With Rachid no request was too great, and no question went unanswered. We traveled in comfort and safety, and with Rachid the time spent in transit was nearly as entertaining as the time spent exploring.You could certainly explore Morocco on your own, but why would you want to when you can arrange an infinitely customizable, efficient and affordable guide from Tenere Tours Morocco? I'll never visit Morocco without their assistance, and I can't recommend their service enough for inexperienced and experienced travelers alike."

Our guide Rachid and driver Ismail felt like family by the end of the trip and would do anything and I mean anything to get us something and to make us happy. I got everything I wanted to see and more out of this tour and I cannot recommend it enough. If you want to take the most scenic pictures you can this is your tour, I'm a photographer and I was in absolute heaven. If your thinking of visiting Morocco do it with these guys you wont regret it."

It was our first time in Morocco and we were very excited for how it would be, being three women alone on a trip in Morocco, but the trip exceeded all our expectations. It was amazing! We all felt safe and experienced so much. We could not have had it better. A big thanks to our guides, Rachid and Hassan who made this trip unforgettable."

Somehow this was achieved without making us feel like tourists but instead a visiting friend. The experience was complete and all questions were answered with kindness and even repeated questions were answered with patience. We were taken off the beaten path and truly felt immersed into the country even though our tour was only a handful of days. Thanks to this tour our experience was that of being warmly welcomed into this fantastic country."
