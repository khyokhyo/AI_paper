We went early before 10am and the queues were short 5 mins to get in. Would recommend as we heard that queues get very long in the afternoon.The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the place is very clean and modern. Also attached to a nice shopping Centre so something for everyone.The views are breathtaking so make sure you visit on a clear day to make the most of it. You can buy tickets on the day so you can choose when to go. Admission is a little pricey and they are a little cheeky in that if you Wu she to go from 350th floor to 450th you have to pay another \u00a310 each which is the reason for the 4 out of 5 stars. However if you can afford it it really is fantastic. If you suffer from vertigo however you may want to give it a miss as I do not but got the collywobbles walking around the top as it is so high."

Skytree is sort of a must see in Tokyo, and in my view also worth visiting, although Tokyo has no shortage of other places with spectacular vistas, some of which are even free, which Skytree certainly is not. But what if you can't get enough of gazing at this peaceful, sprawling, yet dense megalopolis from above? The views from both 350 and 450 are amazing so no disappointment there, at least if the weather is fine as it was on our day there. What would have been even greater would have been access to an outdoor balcony (like Empire State in New York, several other top spots around the world, and occasionally Mori Tower in Tokyo itself), but I suppose there are safety issues and so on to disallow it. And especially the top 450 m. platform is designed so you at times do feel closer to a free view than in some other closed structures.The fast track counter for international visitors is really helpful to beat crowds, we had no more then max 10 minute waits either for tickets, to get up, or to get down and this was on a fairly clear October Saturday mid morning, but I can't promise it wont be worse some days!"

I visited the Sky Tree on a Wednesday morning at about 8.20am as I hadn't booked in advance.It was very quiet and I had no queues to endure which I suspect build up later in the day given the area roped off to manage queues. There is a lot of staff on hand to direct you every 5 yards or so, trust me there is no chance you will get lost or become confused on which turn to make as staff are everywhere. The staff are helpful and extremely courteous as you would expect in Japan.There are two levels to the experience, the 2nd level is only payable when you reach the first level and have the desire to climb another 100 metre's. Views are amazing as you would expect given the height of the Sky Tree and there are plenty of views and opportunities to take photos of Mt. Fuji and the the vast Tokyo skyline. Well worth the trip and my only tip would be to get there early to avoid the queues if you don't have a pre-booked ticket.Enjoy the Skytree!"

After getting into Tokyo we dropped our luggage off at a storage place below the Skytree and thought we might as well go up - great view and a very cool piece of engineering. It was pretty smoggy and foggy the day we went up, definitely recommend going on a clear morning perhaps in winter - would probably be good at night as well!Staff were helpful, there was even a (slightly more expensive) fast-track counter for foreigners to avoid the queues. Luckily didn't need to use it. Souvenir shop has some interesting stuff, and the cafe in the observation deck was surprisingly good quality! Also a massive mall at the foot of the tree for those who are interested in some shopping."

You can find a museum, an aquarium, the upper 360 city view, multiple art exhibits, several floors of restaurants (all types of food are available). At night the tower lights will change colors and patterns making for a great photography backdrop. The JR line goes right to the entrance, about two floors below for easy access."

            "review": "A Good Visit - Plan well for a good weather, avoid long queues and enough time. Generally, a lot of these attractions (tall towers, observation decks, viewing galleries) are more or less the same. However; Tokyo Skytree is worth a visit since it is Tokyo after all. The location is quite central. It can be a walking distance from Asakusa on a good day else you will be tired just walking to the location. First, plan well. Choose a good day with good weather. Must be bright and sunny so you can have a good view. Don't take chances. You will waste both money and time. Secondly, get there early. Recommended that you get their first thing in the morning, say around 10:00AM to beat the rush and possibly a brighter viewing. Foreigners have a special line but you pay extra. Credit cards are accepted. Plan for ~2 hours to make the most of your time and money.The elevators take you to the observation deck in less than 2-4 minutes. It can be crowded. At the observation deck, there are coffee stalls and restrooms. However; as with these places, everything is expensive. You are allowed backpacks so carry water, drinks and snacks.There are also restaurants at the ground level - McDonald, Denny's... But beware that Denny's here has almost no vegetarian food. If you go to the basement there are many other places to eat as well buy snacks and drinks.So if you reach around 10:00 AM, you can then eat lunch at the bottom and then go to your next attraction. And you would have made a good use of your morning time.The attraction is expensive. If I remember correctly it is about US $30.Sorry, don't have recommendation for night time viewing as I visited during the day time."

It was incredibly busy on the shopping floors and there were queues outside most of the restaurants. The Skytree itself was efficiently run and staff were keen to help with pointing me in the right direction and offering ticket advice. Far from touting more expensive tickets they explained it would be better to go to the normal counter instead of the fast track. They even showed footage of how cloudy it was and how bad the view would be before I committed to buying a ticket.To make up for the poor view, a video was played of the view on a good day. Staff members were on hand and were offering to take photos of visitors wearing the headdress of the Skytree mascot. As a solo traveller I really appreciated this and it helped turn around what could have been a very disappointing visit. I could see a little of the view and took a turn on the glass platform on the way down. The lift had a pretty light display. I found the layout of the lower floors a bit confusing and much as I love shopping, it all started to feel a bit enclosed and overwhelming. The shortage of windows and busyness some how made it a rather tiring experience and I didn't buy anything. Very nice loos though!"

As with everything in Japan, things go quietly and efficiently. Suggest you go all the way to the top view platform. It costs a bit more, but worth it. The views are spectacular. Once you are done there is a nice shopping area and food court on the lower floors where you can eat, plus a fantastic supermarket with some of the freshest seafood/fish, sushi and sashimi I have seen.

Going to skytree is expensive, but if you want great views of the largest urban area in the world from the tallest tower in the world then I'd say go for it. The views were spectacular.

Totally recommend paying a little extra for a fast track ticket (15m wait rather than 60m) and paying the extra 500 yen to go to the very top as its much less busy- also- if you're going to the tallest tower in the world surely you want to go to the top!? I've been to the CN tower and One World Trade and I have to admit I found them more impressive - I think they let too many people up to the top of Skytree at once so views are restricted (but waiting times are great) also - Skytree is so tall compared to the rest of Tokyo it feels like you don't really see much! The surrounding area is pretty cool and it's not far to walk for lovely traditional shrines and restaurants. "

Best observation deck in Tokyo and actual highest tower in the world (as in observation tower and not building), across the river from Sensoji Temple in Asakusa. Open until 10pm. Try to time going to the tower to enjoy the view both in daylight and nightlight which we did., and pick a beautiful day to be able to see Mount Fuji from deck. Go to Asakusa station in the afternoon to visit temple and Nakamise Dori--old shopping street leading to the temple and best place in Tokyo to buy souvenirs, and then get back on same line to Oshiage station. There is a big mall at bottom of skytree. There were no lines, so no reason to pay more for expedited tourist line for which I believe that you need your passport. We did not pay extra to visit the highest deck which other reviewers said would have been redundant, and we believe it is accurate. We were about to leave when the cool \"window cleaning entertainment show\" started.\" It is fun, check schedules on web site. Do not buy anything at food or drink stands on that floor (coffee was so mediocre and no place to sit), as there is a better spot, a nice little cafe one floor below with stairs where you can sit comfortably to enjoy the beautiful view. We were surprised that the food tasted that good. In the interest of time, since Tokyo is so big and it is all in close distance from each other, go to Ryogoku in the morning to see sumo training sessions, especially if there is no tournament at the time of your visit. And that will be a well spent day."

So, instead of paying the entry fee to reach the top of the Tree, we stayed on the ground and enjoyed the view looking-up."

You can visit the basic tower about 80% up the allowable distance or pay a few more yen for a visit to the top level. Not much difference of the view. Many school children were visiting the tower on the afternoon we toured the tower. Entrance to the elevators is fast and the staff very efficient. Dedicated elevators are available for the handicapped and those with strollers. The view of fantastic on a clear day. At night the view is further enhanced by the beautiful lights of Tokyo. Many souvenir shops are available on various levels but the shop on the ground level is by far the largest. Many restaurants are available nearby. Expect to spend about 60-90 minutes during the visit. Kids will enjoy the experience which includes a glass floor which provides a view of the scenery below the structure."

We bought tickets to the floor 350 Tembo deck as well as the floor 450 Tembo Galleria. Combo ticket was 4K yen. We started at 350. The view was simply magnificent. It's was dusk and a bit hazy outside although we could still make out the key buildings. The 450 level with surrounding bars made picture taking of scenes outside a bit difficult. There is also a glass floor for one to look straight down. The sumida river digital picture scroll on the lower floor was an interesting. On a clear early the view must be even more spectacular."

I purchased a fast-track pass, which saves time only on the first line up to the 350m observatory. Don't expect Manhattan-like views. Central Tokyo is very far a way, and in the afternoon sun was completely in the haze. The glass floor on the lower (350m) observatory is fun, but it's very small."

Yes, the architecture and technology is impressive, but I feel I could spend the money on something more interesting. Tip - don't go for the 'express ticket for foreigners' - it's even pricier for the premium 'quick entry'. All it does is just zips you through the next elevator up. Just enjoy the ambiance of lining up to the normal ticket booths - it's part of the experience and the line moves quickly anyway."

There is a fast track for foreign visitors, which must grate with the locals but the Japanese are too polite to complain. The lifts whisk you up to the first platform so quickly and easily that when you first step out you cannot believe that you are so high. There is another level (additional cost), which takes you up a further 100 metres. The views are magnificent and apparently Mount Fuji can be seen on a clear day. The view is marred somewhat by the outer tubing that is keeping the structure in place. This is a rather churlish remark as the structure itself is a magnificent piece of engineering. Do try to visit the tower in the morning as the sun is in the right direction for taking pictures of central Tokyo. Our visit was mid-afternoon and we suffered trying to take some good pictures with the bright sun in the wrong place or is it the case that my photographic skills are lacking? Of course, the view must be absolutely splendid at night."

My advice - don't stop at Tembo Deck at 350 m, but go all the way up to Tembo Galleria at 450 m, and you'll find it \"absolutely worthwhile\" with higher windows offering better views than the ones on Tembo Deck. And yes, \"phenomenal\" is the word when it comes to the views especially those to the south with the highest buildings of Tokyo on the west side (so to the southwest from up here) and the waters of the Tokyo Bay on the east side (so to the southeast from up here); pretty much directly below the Tower on the west is the Sumida River with so many bridges spanning over it along its whole length, and at some distance to the east from the Tower (the distance most likely the outskirts of the city on its east side) is the Arakawa River which joins the Tokyo Bay as it flows south.The restaurant & the caf\u00e9 on Tembo Deck (not at 350 m that you get to when going up, but at 345 m & 340 m that you get to on the way down) both seemed overpriced, but there are a number of eating places way down (like on levels 1F to 5F) & KFC just outside level 1F (to your left after leaving the building). But I do suggest visiting the gift shop on Tembo Deck on your way down (at 340 m, on the same level with the cafe); I bought a coin keychain and you can get \"your name & the date you're there\" engraved on the back of the coin (free of charge) either on the 5F (the return level) or on the 1F (the ground level). Also, just before coming down by the return elevator from 340 m to level 5F, you might want to take a brief look through the glass floor on that level (340 m), but it's just a small area that the floor encompasses and the view is nothing much to speak of.If you're at the Asakusa area (like I was), it's a walk of just about a total of 15 minutes to here by first crossing the Sumida River to its east side (the red bridge is the best one) for about 5 minutes then turning left for about a 10-minute walk to the Skytree building. There's also the train (Tobu Skytree Line) between Asakusa Station and Skytree Station which I believe is right under the Skytree building or pretty close to it.Lastly, get there \"early\" so you won't have to line up or have to go into the foreigner lane costing more; I got there at like 7 30 in the morning and even had to wait for them to open at like 8! :)"

I went during the day time and the view was great, bit a bit hazy in the distance. I think going at night or on a crisp day would be a lot better. There's a small cafe that over looks Tokyo. The food was fancy looking but tasted ok. "

From here you can see as far as Yokohama and Mt Fuji on a good day. You realise how huge and sprawling Tokyo is. Buy another ticket and you can be whisked up to 450m. Fewer people and somehow view seems even better. If you have the cash to spare (roughly $10 more) then do it. Transport here is easy with a subway station below (Not a JR pass line. Couple hundred yen for a ticket). Excellent mall and food stores. Loved the fake plastic food shop and man selling hand made knives."

We thought we would have to go through fast lane for international visitors but they told us to go normal as the waiting time is less than 5 mins. When you get to floor 350 (where everyone gets off) you have the option to buy tickets for the Tembo Galleria which is access to floor 445 to 450. It was worth the extra money as the view from there was absolutely breathtaking. The wraparound Galleria was also a sight to be seen. The commemorative photo at an added cost was a nice treat. Watch the sunset from here and as the city lights up you realise the magnitude of how big tokyo city really is. As you leave on floor 340 there are 2 glass floors areas where you could stand on and take photos. There are some cafes/restaurants on the top. As you descend down you realise there is actually a shopping center for a few floors. The food court was so clean and spacious with variety of food including ramen, takoyaki etc. Don't forget to check out the Sumida River Digital picture scroll on the ground level or (1st floor as they call it here). Amazing piece of mixed art. Overall well worth the money spent just to give you a birds eye view of the magnificence and the sheer size of thia beautiful city"

The experience going up the elevator was really neat with the music and lights. Your ears will pop as you go up quickly! I didn't realize as a foreigner to Japan, that we could have skipped the line to a non-Japanese passport holder. That is important to note as it could save you a lot of time! If you go to Tokyo make sure you do this!!"

I am not sure how I missed this tower since it was completed J. 2010. During our recent visit my family asked if we wanted to take the kids to the Tokyo Skytree. They then proceeded to describe the tower and of course we said yes. We have visited observation towers in many cities however this was the best experience. The height of the two observation decks are what makes the tower unique along with a view of one of the most crowded cities in the world. The only negative that we experienced was the lines however that is because we visited the tower during the start of one of the largest holidays in Japan...Obon. The themed elevators are smooth and extremely fast. The circle walk located at 450 meters provides an amazing view. The wind chimes (fans blowing on them) add to the experience. We recommend the Tokyo Skytree Tower."

So if you plan to visit at the weekend, my advice would be to book your time slot in advance. For same tickets, you have to first queue to get allocated a time and then join another queue to buy the ticket...before then finally joining a final queue for the lift...when you return at your allocated time! Alternatively, if you are foreign (so not a Japanese national), you can buy a fast ticket which allows you immediate access. There is a price difference (normal 2,060 JPY compared to 3,000 JPY) which is well worth it if you have time constraints. The other point worth noting is the above price is for the 350m level. You can pay another 1,000 JPY to go to the 450m level but my honest opinion is it's not worth it! The views are good enough at 350m.There is also a restaurant at almost 350m but we did not try that as it was out of my price range."

Being 450m above Tokyo, which you get to in a lift which peaks at a speed of 600km is pretty impressive. You understand the sheer size of this sprawling metropolis with skyscrapers clustered all over. It puts in perspective the geography of the city and also all you here about the size of the population. As with everywhere in Japan, despite the crowds, it runs with incredible efficiency. We went at 11am on a weekend so there were masses of people but foreign visitors with passports can go to a fast track queue where you don't have to wait for what could be hours for your turn to go up in the lift. There is a small additional premium of \u00a5400 per ticket for this privilege but it is well worth it. Tickets to go to the first level only at 350m are available but well worth the extra for 100m more. If you want to eat in the restaurant bookings are essential as it fills up quickly but worth it.

It's fantastic' Has some nice shops and restaurants around which you can enjoy after."

You can actually go to the top of the tower, the cost varies depending on where you bought your ticket, expect to pay somewhere around ~3000 Yen. If that's not your thing, enjoy the view and get a drink at the bar that's at the terrace."

If you go around the glassy front entrance, past the vending machines and lockers (or go up the escalators from the TV Character store), there's a little desk. At this desk, you can speed up the whole Skytree process. It will cost like 800 yen extra, but it allows you to join a sort of \"Foreigners Only\" quick line that gets you in, in my case, within 10 minutes into the lift going up to the main observation deck. Make sure you have your passport on you for this, cause you need proof of being a Foreigner. But 800 yen extra to save HOURS of wait time, I think is an okay trade off."

Not only were there less crowds overall (in the ticket lines, on the top floors, etc.), it made for a more enjoyable experience. Sure, there were still a lot of people at night, but I can't imagine what it's like during the day when the line queues are super long! At night, you get the same great view with a more relaxed feel. There's a quick 10 minute dance show on the first major top floor that's pretty cool and fun to watch, albeit blaring lay loud, but still enjoyable. You can get a photo taken of yourself by their photos there and then buy it afterwards, but we decided not to and just enjoy the views. The gift shop up there is a perfect place to buy stuff that they say can't be bought on the ground floor. Overall, a must see place day or night. Just be prepared to wait when crowded.

There were long queues for both lifts coming down, particularly from 345m to ground.Next to Oshiage metro train station (A20 on Asakusa line), the Skytree is easily reached from Narita airport (Access Express trains use the Narita Sky Access Line directly to/from Narita for ~\u00a51100, or US$10.50, on top of the 24-hour metro pass).Views from the top look promising but were practically non-existent when I visited due to smog.Bonus exhibition of 'Ultraman' for those familiar with the Japanese superhero."

It was a beautiful day and the city looked crisp and clean. There was a little haze in the far distance so Mount Fuji and Hakone etc could be seen in outline but not with any clarity. The elevators were beautiful and you could look out and up as you traveled to your destination, The queues moved quickly, however, in hindsight we should have prepurchased our tickets on the web. The female staff were beautifully dressed and very friendly. It is worth looking at the animated digital streetscapes whilst waiting in the initial queues. Note, you do need to purchase a second ticket to move from the tembo deck at 350m to the Tembo Galleria at 450m. There are less people on this level, so it was worthwhile. It is also worth noting that there is some great shopping in the building, as well as a food court. We ended up patronising a number of stalls (rice crackers for my husband, clothing for my daughter and paper products/stationery for myself, as well as the obligatory Hello Kitty souvenir). Also had some great icecream and lunch. Allow plenty of time for shopping and browsing as well, There is also an aquarium. It was a fun day and I was really glad that I went. Highly recommended."

Usually there will be a very long queue if you get late. Best scenarios can be enjoyed on a clear day. Ticket you buy at the entrance is valid only to visit 350m level. if you want to travel the top observatory at 450m you need to buy another ticket at the counter in 350m level."

We read many reviews that when it is packed, the experience becomes less enjoyable. For us, there were only about 10 other people up on the observation deck. We rode the elevator alone to the top.So, if you like the views but don't like the crowds, go there just before closing time.The Tokyo Skytree is not in the center of Tokyo, so pretty much all you will see is the huge sprawl of buildings and houses. This had more a Los Angeles kind of feel and not a New York one. There are mid sized buildings and houses lined up as far you can see but not many tightly packed sky scrapers. It is impressive nonetheless, but on a different level.The tickets are quite pricey in my opinion. You will only spend about 30 - 45 minutes up there and the tickets will cost you about half of what a ticket to Disneyland will cost you.I don't regret going up there because seeing and experiencing anything from that high up is quite impressive. But I will admit that it wasn't as special as I envisioned it to be. There is something missing in the experience to make it special and I don't know what it is."

But if you have a few options and you are weighing what to do--I would go elsewhere and have yourself an expensive dinner instead.We visited late morning and used the fast lane, which meant that we gladly paid an extra 800 yen on top of our individual ticket price of 2000 yen to speed past the long queue. So about 28 bucks apiece for the ticket. We waited about 15 minutes to get tickets and then another 15-20 to load the elevator..which was an experience. They packed so many people on the elevator that it wasn't safe. A lady literally cried out that she was afraid her baby would be squished as they packed is beyond sardine level. Once off the elevator we got the main observation deck. We did not purchase tickets to go further up. We didn't realize that once we left the main observation deck to go down to the two lower decks that we would essentially be standing in a line for the next hour to get back on the elevator for the return trip. So 28 bucks to be squished in an elevator and then about 15 minutes of viewing and then an hour in line to go down as we walked in line through the lower observation levels. Our son really liked the part where the floor was glass. The staff never used English even when talking directly to our family which I found odd in that they were conveying very long messages and apparently thought we understood. We we constantly encouraged to pack in lines as closely as possible. I just found that being a cow in a line for slaughtered wasn't very much fun. To be really honest the view was not all that appealing...Tokyo has the tallest tower but not much to see from it--the mountains are rarely viewable.

The ride up to the top in the elevator was fast and smooth \u2013 no jolts at all. The only thing that alerted us to how high we were going was our ears popping! Since the Skytree offers a 360 degree view of Tokyo, you walk around in a circle until you reach the section you want to see. Each section corresponds on the map to a part of Tokyo \u2013 I think section 7-9 provides a view of Mt. Fuji on a clear day. Unfortunately, it was cloudy and a bit misty the day we went so no Mt.Fuji in sight! We went around 5pm so we were able to see the sun almost setting. The view was really spectacular! Even though we were so high up, it didn\u2019t feel like it was and therefore, people who are afraid of heights might not necessarily feel it so badly. Be sure to check out the Skytree Solamachi on your way down from the Skytree \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of stores and delicious restaurants!"

If you want to buy the regular rate, you can wait up to 1-2 hours before you even get to the ticketing counter. You then have to wait to enter the lifts. We bought tickets at the fast lane counter and it took us about 20 minutes from the time we had the tickets to the time we got on the lift. So yes well worth the extra cash. To go al the way up, you'll have to add another 1000 yen (about) once you're on the 350 th floor. Shame you can't just buy the 2 tickets at once instead of having to queue again. Once up the tower, it's no different from any other tower in the world, only the panorama changes obviously:)! There's a little souvenir shop at the top but a much bigger one once you come down so probably not worth carrying bags with you during your visit. All the way at the top there's a 'Ultraman' museum and not much else. The whole visit lasted about 4-5 hours but we didn't shop around the mall and shops. We had to wait until late to have something to eat as there's no restaurants at the top (closed for lunch funny enough). Good day out but choose a day when it's clear outside to be bale to see Mount Fuji and other landmarks"

If you are same with me, would advise no need to pay so much expensive ticket to go up to the tower. We took a lot of nice pictures of the tower downstairs. I would think that the ticket fees are very expensive. We just spent half an hour up there. That's all, nothing much. Not worthy it to pay so expensive tickets to go up to the tower."

We expected to go in this line but a nice person said that the volume was low and we should just stand in the regular line since the wait was less than 15 seconds. The foreign traveler line allows you to bypass the big lines but it\u2019s slightly more expensive. The tower was built in 2010 it rivals other observation towers like the Mori Tower and the Tokyo Tower. The Skytree has two observation levels, one at 1,150\u2019 and the other a bit higher at 1480\u2019. The higher is an additional cost but there are less people. There are plenty of photo opportunities and there are many displays which help you locate landmarks as you circle the path around.

Try and go as early as possible, to avoid the long lines. It also has a glass floor area (about 10' x 10') on the lower level, although it is not a very big.

The lines (which must get long at times, judging by the numerous line dividers) were a little confusing - we tried to buy a ticket, but apparently it was the group line (our group didn't qualify as one) and were told something about an 800 yen discount. It turned out to be the daytime ticket, which is still over 2,000 yen per ticket. This ticket is good for the Tembo Deck, the 350 meter level; there is a separate ticket to go to the top level, the Tembo Galleria (450 m). A group was herded to crowd into a dark alcove (all of us were puzzled - were we already in the elevator?), and eventually, elevator doors opened in front of us and we moved forward. The very smooth and silent ride took seconds. In addition to the views, the Tembo Deck also has electronic displays that can zoom in to a particular area. I am not sure that the views would have much meaning for those who are not familiar with Tokyo and the surrounding regions; it is a bit far to see some of the more familiar tourist areas, and perhaps observatories or views from tall buildings closer to these areas would be more interesting, even if they don't approach the height of the Tembo Deck. The deck also has a cafe and a restaurant. A few levels down, there are two small areas that have glass floors. All in all, like they say about scaling Mt. Fuji, it was good to go once."

The shape of it allows you to virtually look straight down, which not many towers and spires allow you to do. I got some PHENOMENAL photos from up there of all parts of Tokyo and surrounding areas.When you enter Skytree, you will see a LOT of people. I'm not sure why, but there was no line for the top if we paid about 800 Yen extra each... which was well worth the 1-2hr wait for all of the other people. ALWAYS look for a faster way to the top.Other than that, it was a typical tourist trap, but a good one.

The suburb is a bit quiet and there isn't too much to do, but the whole complex is built directly above the train station. Easy to do and see, but probably not for everyone.

After three subsequent visits to the Skytree, I figure it's time for a review. The Skytree is accessible by Tokyo Metro or by the Keiyu Skytree Line. The Skytree line costs about $1.50 from the Asakusa Station. The Pasmo or Suica cards will get you there too. The Skytree complex is fairly large, with plenty of shops and restaurants, including McDonalds for some cheap eats (try the Ebi [shrimp] Filet!). Ticket lines for the Skytree are long but do move briskly. Tickets are roughly $25 and an extra $10 for the upper level. They do take credit cards. The lines for the elevators are long but also move quickly too. Probably takes about 20-25 minutes from queuing to arriving at the first viewing level. I have purchased the additional ticket to go up to the highest (second) level, but I've found that the first level is plenty fine and the views are great. Do find the Plexiglass floor and stand over the open view about 1000 feet below. Freaky, slightly unnerving, but cool. It takes about 20-30 minutes to get your fill of the Tokyo horizons and then it's time to go. Very worth it, slightly better than the Tokyo Radio Tower, but they're both good. I'd definitely recommend a visit if you have time, but if you're pressed for time, stay on the ground and see the sights from there. Aloha!"

There are a lot of restaurants and gourmet food shops in the basement so don't fret about not having food options if you don't use the cafe at the top. Lastly, if you are traveling on a JR Pass, you can get all the way to Kinshicho Station using the JR Pass, which is just one station away, then you can take a subway for one stop to Oshiage Station for 170 yen, then walk to the SkyTree from there."

As there were a lot of people there, we were told to get in line to purchase tickets for an entrance in 2.5 hrs.We then asked, if we could buy tickets for the next day and were send to the 7eleven.At first, we couldn't find the 7eleven and asked around in the lower floor at ticket counters and so on. On the last one, some tourist ticket booking company, they told us that we can go back up (to where we started) as asked for a quick pass which can be handled to foreign tourist. Well, at least that's what I understood. And on the website, you cannot buy any tickets as foreigner (you would need a Japanese credit card I believe from what has been translated by google translate).After some walking around, we found the 7eleven. They have a ticketing machine, but you can only buy tickets for the Skytree, when the language is set to Japanese. Unfortunately, there were some people in the store and the lady had to leave us to get back to the cashier.After clicking around, we were stuck and had to bother the lady again. At the end, we needed to write our names in Japanese to get a voucher, that we had to pay to receive some temporary tickets with a timeslot for the next day.Next day: Everything went well with our prepurchased tickets. No waiting line, we could just get in. It was a good idea to get there at 10 AM, so all the viewing decks were not too busy.The view was nice, but then, the day before, we went to the \"World Trade Center Japan\", paid some 600 yen and the view was much better.With this experience, we found the Sky tree as overrated. But then, when in Tokyo, this seems to be a thing to be done.But be prepared to get the tickets beforehand."

If you are a tower fan, it is worth paying the extra to go to very top where the viewing areas are much, much better. A tip for foreign visitors - ignore the main entrance and use the VIP entrance for foreign visitors which is a bit further round from the main entrance and you will avoid all the queues. It is expensive but well worth it as a once in a lifetime chance to visit this incredible building. Easy to reach by public transport.

Also a disappointment as it was crowded, and small. Basically enjoy views from the plane, or on the ground. Or hotel bars."

After purchasing a ticket (approx 2400 pp) a huge lift takes you to the 350th floor, the floors must be very small however or by floor do they mean metres?However, great view over the whole of Tokyo including Fuji if the weather is favourable.Take the escalator down one or two floors from the main viewing floor as it is quieter and there are a few seats.You can get another ticket for approx 1200pp to go higher again but I don't think this is necessary."

The lines were LONG so either buy your tickets in advance (we saw a line for people who pre-purchased, we did not and the regular line was going to be 40-60 minutes) or purchase tickets from the express line, it was more expensive (only about $8USD more though, if I remember correctly, so totally worth it) and we were escorted to the front of the line and it took only about 5 minutes. (Ask for directions to where to buy tickets for the express line, it was a bit tricky to find.) Once on the main deck, you had to wait in the regular line to go to the very top (and pay more), so we did not do that and can't comment about the views up there.The main observation deck was very nice. Clearly it was built to provide guests with good views. But it was very crowded!Prior to visiting the Skytree, we were at Tokyo Tower (we basically went there by mistake). In all honesty, we had not originally planned to visit the Skytree (and definitely not Tokyo Tower), but it was such a beautiful day we decided to go up a tower for a view. I asked for directions to Tokyo Tower when I was wanting the Skytree. Anyway, since we were at the Tower, we went up. There were no lines, and we went all the way up to the top (had to buy extra ticket) but the views were beautiful, it was cheaper, and you didn't have to deal with the lines (which were 40-60 minutes long)! We would recommend the Tower over the Skytree, unless you just \"have to\" see the Skytree."

No denying it.However, the biggest problem is in a way its own success and that it gets very busy. You will have to queue for everything. Even if you have an advance ticket you will still queue. You queue for tickets. You queue for security. You queue to go up in the lifts. You queue to go down in the lifts. Of the 3 hours we spent there we easily spent 2 of these queuing.The other slight issue is that although it offers 360 degree views, some of the 360 degrees are occupied by shops and cafes and photo-ops, so if you want to see better from those areas you need to spend more money.Certainly go for the views, but be aware its an expensive day and you *will* spend a lot of it queuing unless you find a way to miss the usual crowds."

If you have the time and money to spare, then go for it. If not, forget it.We went there on a Tuesday and the place was crowded. We had to line up to get a ticket to enter the building. This ticket indicated the time we had to come back to get inside. Inside the building, the people still need to line up to buy the ticket to get to the top of the tower. We came in around 11:30 in the morning and the time on our ticket was 2:30 in the afternoon. Those were 3 hours wasted on waiting right there. (Well, should have been. Will explain below why.) I must say though that the system is very organized because at least people don't have to waste their time while lining up to get inside.To kill more time, we just roamed around the area. You can shop for souvenirs around the area. It is like a big mall. If you are hungry, I suggest that you go eat at the food court because their food is so much cheaper as opposed to restaurants. Plus, you get a variety of options.While walking around the mall, we accidentally found another entrance to the tower. There was another counter to buy tickets to get to the tower. However, these tickets are for international visitors only. For additional fee, we can get VIP treatment wherein we skip the long line and get into the tower quickly. We showed our passports and paid \u00a52,820 per person. I think it's worth it to pay the extra fee because we saved more time. We only had to wait 15 mins in order to get to the view deck. (We didn't need to use the 2:30pm ticket we had) Once we got to the 350m high view deck, the view was awesome but there's not a lot to see. There are not a lot of tall buildings closer to us that stood out. I was pretty bummed out too because we didn't see Mt. Fuji. It was probably because it was a little bit cloudy. Anyway, we spent around 30 mins at the top and 2.5 hours to enter and exit the tower. By the way, if you are looking for a snow globe, I think Tokyo Skytree is the only place where you can buy it. Whenever I travel, I always get a snow globe as a souvenir. I was looking all over Tokyo and I only saw snow domes which are too big for my preference.Overall, I enjoyed the visit but I don't think I'll recommend it to my family and friends."

Unfotunately, it was forecast to be cloudy and rainy for the whole week I was in Tokyo and the views were really quite below average due to this. I thought it seemed a bit ridiculous to pay a total of $50AUD to see very below average views so I decided to leave and had another 20 minute wait in line to go back down to ground level.

Cost over $100 Aus as there were 3 of us.Be warned if you do this right away you will miss out on the floor view that the lifts initially take you to. So walk around and see this floor view first. Apparently you can see Mount Fuji on a clear day but it is generally hazy. So no Mount Fuji.The lifts are run by a polite ladies who take you up the lift but the top lift is automatic and take you to the right floor. Also you have plenty of official photographers in cordon off areas, that will take photos which takes a lot of room up on the first viewing area as you are usually already 3-5 people deep at the edges taking photos - but be patient - and a little determined to get a good spot to take photos.Now if you buy a ticket to go up to the penultimate floor - well worth it, but expensive - again the official photographers await. Once there you will go up a gentle ramp that takes you around the top area until you get to the very top where you can take a photo of the height that you are at.Now this is were I was caught as I thought I could go back to the lower deck to retook at this floor but you can't do this so don't get separated from anyone you are travelling with. Once you get into the lift to go down, go down you do to the floor with the shop which is almost at the bottom.Again no seating until you reach the shop floors at the bottom of the Skytree and they are few so wear good shoes and make allowances."

First tip - there is no ticket offices on a ground floor for an individual guest. Only groups can buy tickets there. In order to but individual tickets you will have to take an escalator to hight floors. Buying tickets is easy. Then go through a check point, show them you do not carry any hazardous itmes in your bag and you will be allowed to take a lift up there to 340 m floor.This is the fastest lift I have ever took. It takes only 50 sec. to go up.Then you may take escalator or a lift to 345 with a niec view on Tokyo area.Take a lift up to 450 m floor and you will be half in heaven ;-)EASY!"

The lift that takes you up is so quick, your up in no time (with popped ears due to the pressure change!). Be prepared to wait your turn for a spot right up to the window - if it's too busy pop down a level, there's a better chance of getting better photos and there's a small glass floor panel too (with the option of a photo, at a small price). Worth a visit - however I believe there are other towers to see similar views in other areas in Tokyo that may be worth a look especially if your not a fan of crowds or queues."

For the same price the Japanese did a much better job. The elevator ride was much smoother and was more interesting. Different color lights were flashing inside the elevator all the way up, making us feel like we were ascending to the sky. We were there on a cloudy day but it cleared up magically in the afternoon. So we got our view and had a smaller crowd. We stayed until sunset to take photos of the city lighting up at night. Then they surprised us with a 15-minute \"window cleaning\" show when we were about to leave. The theme was some crazy birds attacking the skytree windows with bird droppings and the poor window cleaning crew had to battle with them, with music and dancing. After that we head down and got to stand on the glass floor. Then we took the elevator down as the male and female attendants made their perfect 45 degree bows to us as the elevator doors were closing. Feeling like some special VIPs we descended. Our eyes were wide opened when the elevator doors opened again to a huge food court with all kinds of yummy food! We were really impressed how they put the whole package together."

The 243 meter tall building has two towers, and each houses an observatory at a height of 202 meters. It had been the tallest building in Tokyo until it was overtaken by the Midtown Tower in 2007.With favorable weather conditions, famous landmarks such as Mount Fuji, the Tokyo Skytree, Tokyo Tower, Meiji Shrine and the Tokyo Dome can be seen from the observatories. Each observatory has a cafe and a souvenir shop. The North Observatory remains open later at night, making it a popular spot to catch night views of the city."

Ticket price for the top section (450m) is on the high side, but worth it.

I would not recommend paying for the photos they take as you can still take really good photos. I will also recommend to not spend your time at the first floor the elevator stops you in and take the escalator to the floor below (same floor to where you exit). This floor was emptier and has the glass floor look out (which is average). The glass floor is small so don't have too high hopes for this. Also, there is no need to go higher by paying more. The view is more then sufficient here and you can get some really good spots for photos. Please do not use flash. Ruins a lot of your photos.Afterwards we got our bags from the lockers below (near the entrance of the mall which was still open for access to lockers). Keep in mind most of the places by the time the tower closes is also closed. So all we did was take some night photos near the tower."

The Skytree is far from the center of the city and it took us 1hr 15 minutes and three trains to get there from our hotel near Shinjuku. The views of the main clusters of skyscrapers around Shiodome, Tokyo Station and Shinjuku are all quite distant as a result. The Mori tower in Roppongi is a better bet - it is not as high but it is centrally located, has more room at the top plus it has an open air deck. It also has better views since it is in the middle of the action, so to speak."

We had some UDON noodles from one of the food galleries on the west side for only one reason that they were making the Udon noodles fresh there and then behind the counter. This was just a take away counter not a fancy restaurant where you would expect fresh noodles to be made on the premises.Anyway when we come back to Tokyo 11 days later the weather was better and we headed up to buy the tickets on the forth floor.We already knew the prices and they don't have a ticket where you can view during the day and come back for the night view.So we timed it about two hours before sunset and then stayed another hour or so after sunset.If you are keen photographer be sure to bring you tripond even for day shots, just to get clearer pictures especially if you use you zoom setting a must.

Hint: purchasing tickets on-line, ahead allows one to reduce the wait at the tower. I initially went to the 350m deck. The view is amazing, and is already higher than the top deck of the older, Tokyo Tower. I paid the additional fee to go up to the 450m deck, (an extra $11) and the crowds were thinner there. A 100m ramp arches along the edge in a more \"tube\" like structure, so visitors can see up and down. For photos the slanted glass in the viewing area is better, as there are fewer reflections in the glass. Mt. Fuji was faintly visible in the distance the day I visited. Great 360 degree views Tokyo.

Air quality may not seem too bad on the ground, but when you're trying to get 10, 15 or 20km of visibility even a little bit of air pollution can make a big difference.

The queue for everyone was long so we took the 'fast pass' option. It's not that large an area and the cafe didn't offer any other option to ice cream or hot drinks, but the Windows and information boards are very good and it's an amazing experience, albeit at a high price. There's a small shop at the top and a larger shop selling souvenirs, (which helped us to fulfil our obligations) which is at the bottom of the attraction. We were there for less than 2 hours, so we felt it was not that good value but it did help me deal with a slight anxiety of heights so that was positive."

Now, first things first: this isn't the single most impressive view you'll ever see of a city from the towers of the world, and it's pretty darn overpriced at about 2,800 yen or so per person. However, the view is gorgeous at night, and it was especially nice for us since there was no wait at all; we must've come at a really good time at night. We went to the 350, 345, and 340 meter levels and enjoyed them all, and they even have a glass floor at the 340 m level. Also, as soon as we went up the tower, they played a little play for us called Wipe Up, which was cute; the employees dressed as window washers and danced and sang.Oh, another thing: the food and gift shops here are, like the entrance fee, ridiculously expensive, and Tokyo Skytree has the dubious honor of having fed me literally the worst doughnut I've ever had in my life. Seriously, do they make them out of rubber? How do you even mess up a doughnut? Come on now.Recommended only if you have cash to burn just because of how incredibly overpriced it was. Take away how needlessly expensive everything was, and the experience itself is really nice. I also hear the view is better than Tokyo Tower, so there's that."

The shopping in the shops underneath the Tokyo SkyTree are all new and a great place to buy your souvenirs from.

There are 2 levels you can visit while you're at the SkyTree. There's a mid-tier where most people go (via elevator) and it takes you pretty far up. Everyone gets in line and you're whisked up some very fast elevators to the viewing platform. You get off, and wander around the viewing area, to see 360 degree views of Tokyo and surrounding areas / waters, etc.If you're in for some more height and thrills, you can get in line to buy another separate ticket that takes you to the TALLEST viewing platform, which is about 10+ floors higher than where most people get off.Grand views all around, and plenty of photo opportunities too. Be sure to visit the \"glass viewing area\" in the mid-tier area, where you can walk on top of glass and take a look down to the ground floor of the sky tree (you can see cars driving, etc.). Incredible views and kinda scary for those who are afraid of heights! Well worth a trip and highly recommend for 1st time visitors to Tokyo!"

They do warn you about this as well when you buy a ticket, they also told us as it was quiet we need not pay the extra for the fast entry. Very honest and great customer service from the start.The lift up is great fun, you go very quick and it make your ears pop more than once but the views are amazing. It is massive upstairs with 3 levels on the lower deck including the glass platform. Walk around and take it all in, it has a cafe also but you pay for the view there, it is not cheap.The one downside is that it is quite expensive, but it is worth it I feel."

Many people at the top but it's the best way to appreciate Tokyo's incredible sprawl, although definitely try for a sunny day (I couldn't see Fuji but I saw other snowcapped mountains).

The views are similar but you see more of the Sumida River from the Skytree.The three levels of the Tembo Deck are connected by escalators. There are two photo services available where you can buy a photo that they take of you with a view of Tokyo in the background or with the glass floor. There are eateries on the Tembo Deck.Around the base of the Skytree, there are various food outlets and shops.

While this is fundamentally designed as an NHK communication tower, the developer Tobu Railway Co. is exploiting it to anchor its commercial development below. The direct rail connection to Narita is obvious in its intentions to make it highly accessible even to visitors on long transits such as I. And so I got to Skytree very early in the morning from Narita after arriving on over night flight with 10 hours to spare before catching another outbound. The early hour meant that the treacherously long queues had not yet materialized. Aware that an express line for foreign visitors was available (at a premium) I headed to the obscurely (I wonder why?) located counter. The reception there was kind enough to advise me to buy a regular ticket since the wait was only 5 minutes at that hour of the morning. Soon I was speeding up the tower to the 350m level. Another ticket is necessary to ascend to the 450m tier. The difference in the views are negligible and the question does arise on the rationale other than deriving more revenue sources. Indeed right throughout this attraction are more than ample opportunities to do so from the touristy gift shop and cafe to chargeable photo ops on transparent floor sections. Admittedly the young enthusiastic crew is super efficient in crowd management and cheerful a la Disney; almost. They do try to make the entire visit enjoyable but am afraid to say that the experience is as sterile and uninspiring as the sparkling clean white dull-looking tower that rises over the banks of the Sumida River. While this is a highly visible icon, it is not IMHO not a high priority \"must-see\"."

Make sure you go earlier to get the time slotted tickets. Once you go and start lining up, it takes a while because there's more lining up inside. I think about 30mins later you will take the elevators up there. The view is spectacular, Tokyo city is an amazing place; if you're on a budget, go to Tokyo tower as it's just as nice in terms of the view (simply not as tall) and it's a bit cheaper at Tokyo tower."

But the elevator to the top was done very stylishly and really built up a kind of anticipation for what the view would be like. Luckily the day I went up you could actually see the outline of Mt. Fuji in the distance, and at 106 km away? That was really impressive. After being to the top of the Empire State and other buildings, I didn't expect to be as blown away from this as I was. It may have just been the combination of the clear day and my last day in Japan, but to me, it was really worth a visit."

You can bypass them to get to the ticket level where you buy an elevator ride to the Tembo Deck at 350 meters. Here you can get a nice view of the city and have various opportunities to have your picture taken. Here is also where you buy tickets to the Galleria Deck.At 450 meters you are up there pretty high. The people flow takes you on an inclined path around the tower before you exit via elevator back to the Tembo Deck. The views, of course, are spectacular as is the structure itself. They control the number of people that are up there at any time so it is crowded but never so packed that you can't get an extended look at whatever you want to see.I am glad we did it and would do it again...this time during the day."

They also had the history of the area displayed by old pictures. Lots of people go up but it was not unreasonably crowded. There is a cafe on the main viewing platform but it offers little selection and was pricey. We were there in the afternoon and stayed through dusk so that we could see the city lights. Well worth doing. The only downside is there is NO seating; I'm sure to have people move on instead of lingering all day. But after a day of sightseeing my feet were tired.

There are excellent 360 views and they've done a great job but I just felt that the skyline of Tokyo doesn't lend itself to this kind of tower as other cities do.For me I preferred more local sightseeing where we could enjoy Christmas lights or temples."

You also have the possibility to go up an additional 100 meters, you get to go the additional 100 meters in a glass elevator so beware if you are scared of heights (Even thought the 350 meters might be tough this will surely test your will). It costs 2060 Yen for the first deck and 1030 extra for the second deck. Be sure to go on a day where there are no clouds and the wind isn't blowing too much"

A broadcasting, restaurant and observation tower in Sumida, Tokyo, the tower is the \u201ctallest tower\u201d in the world and the second tallest structure in the world.Tokyo Skytree also serves as the primary television and radio broadcast site for the Kanto region.As of 2015, Tokyo Skytree now has free Wi-Fi service and the location has a great view of the city via being on the first observatory deck (350m, Tokyo Skytree Tembo Deck) and the Tokyo Skytree Tembo Galleries (450m).I thought the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building had fast elevators but Tokyo Skytree is fascinating because of how quick you can move from the bottom floor all the way up to the Tembo Deck.While you can get advanced reservations through Tokyo Skytree Web Ticket, you can purchase day tickets from the 4th floor ticket counter but it\u2019s best to get there early because its often crowded.But right after visiting Tokyo Sky Tree, definitely check out the shops, especially at Tokyo Solamachi."

Or, if you're foreigner, an express ticket counter is available to put you in front of the lines with extra fee. To get to the observation deck requires one ticket from the lobby.

What particularly surprised me was how cheap it was, only around 2000\u00a5, (about \u00a310). You get a guide book and the whole place is lined with information boards. The only problem I have with it is how hard it is to take good photos at night, but that's going to be the case in this sort of environment. Absolutely recommended! Go just before the sun set, that way you can see Tokyo by day and by night! On a clear day you can see Mount Fuji!"

As with most towers there was a long line to go up and limited space to look out, and the price wa even fairly steep for an attraction in Tokyo (considering so many of the best are free.). As with any tower it is best to go up when you actually have an idea what you are looking for, so it is better to go later on in one's time in the city but even then it is not really worth the time or money.

There are several towers in Tokyo that we can actually see Tokyo City from a high point. The famous one in red colour is of course the Tokyo Tower. The popularity of Tokyo Tower is severely affected by the coming into being - Tokyo Skytree which is higher and almost double that of Tokyo Tower.There are 2 levels at Tokyo Skytree. The first level, entrance tickets could be purchased through on-line whereas the second level it can only be bought at the first level when you are actually there and not offered for on-line purchase. Purchasing the tickets on-site is cheaper than buying them on-line. Depending on the month and day we are visiting, basically it is quite easy to purchase the tickets on-site. The main problem of buying tickets on-line would be the weather at that time. If the weather is cloudy there is nothing much to be seen. But buying the tickets on-sight will offer the flexibility to wait for a clear sky.It is advisable to spend a little bit more to visit the second level which by far is not that crowded and we can take better pictures than from the first level. The structure at the second level is also different from the one at the first level and it is much more better looking and a better view. Dont missthe second level just because we need to pay extra, as it is definately worth it.The best view of the whole building of Skytree could be taken once we reach the Asakusa Nakamise shopping district where the famous Temple is located. Due to its height we could not take the photo from the underneath of the buildind but have to be slightly far away to have a good view.The Tokyo Skytree is connected to a big shopping mall and they have good selection of local and international brands and we found them much cheaper than at Ginza or Otomesendo Hill . In fact we took the advantage to shop here instead of the City Centre. There are a variety of eating places around the Tokyo Skytree and it would take a whole day trip from going to the Tokyo SkytreeTower followed by shopping around it and then proceed to Asakusa Nakamise shopping street.We cannot imagine going for the first time to Tokyo without visiting the Tokyo Skytree. You can miss the free tower at the Government Metropolitan Building or the one at Ropponggi or even the Tokyo Tower but not the Tokyo Skytree. So if you are in Tokyo make an effort to visit Tokyo Skytree as it is a MUST when in Tokyo.Saharudin & MariamReporting 10.02.2016Visiting November 2015"

Being from Canada, we asked about the jump the line option with passport, but the girl was rather fair and said that it may not be worth the extra 700Y as the wait was only 10 minutes. It was, and it was SOO worth going. This structure (only 3 years old) is soo nice it blows the CN Tower away. But the views are outstanding and it really puts into perspective the size of the world's largest city. Did the additional high deck and would go if you are there. We went at around 4PM and were able to hang out and see day views, but also the turn to dusk and night. Impressive. Note the Star Wars exhibit is not too much to write home about (but think this installation is ending soon)"

            "review": "Birds Eye View and lovely when the sun goes down!. I have lived in Japan for over 3 years now and previous efforts to get into the Skytree on a weekend did not materialise as I had to buy a ticket in the morning and return late afternoon just to get in due to its popularity. Admittedly the Skytree was completed in 2012 so still relatively new at the time. Some 3 years later the ques are not as bad. This time around we went on Friday around midday and did not have the same problem. We waited in line for tickets for about 30 minutes before going up into the Skytree. Tickets can be purchased on the day at the 4th floor Ticket Counter or they can be bought in advance online for a fixed date and time or from Seven eleven stores which costs more. If bought at the venue, the tickets cost \u00a52060 for adults, \u00a51540 for 12-17 year olds, \u00a5930 for 6-11 year olds and \u00a5620 for 4-5 year olds. This ticket price takes you to the Tembo Deck. (Advance purchased tickets for a reserved date and time cost about \u00a5500 more per ticket for each age group). There is also a Fast Skytree ticket which costs \u00a52820 for an adult. The Tembo Deck takes you about 3 quarters of the way up the tower. If you want to go to the Tembo Galleria which is higher, you need to buy an extra ticket when you get to the Tembo Deck. For an adult, that costs an extra \u00a51030 for an adult and can only be bought on the day when you get there. So for an adult wanting to go to the top (Tembo Deck) you pay \u00a53090 for a ticket- not cheap!Is is worth it? You still get a pretty amazing view from the Tembo Deck but we forked out the extra and went to the top. At the moment there is a STAR WARS themed display going on in Tembo Galleria. The Galleria also has a nice sloped walkway that winds itself around the tower. The views are incredible and really give a great sense of how huge and concentrated a city Tokyo is. I have been up the free Tokyo Metropolitan Building in Shinjuku but the perspective from Tokyo Skytree was more impressive with views of the Sumida river and Tokyo Bay. On a really clear day, you can also see Mt Fuji.We got there in the afternoon and waited until sunset to take amazing photos of the sunset and also the views at night when the lights came on. There is a bar and restaurant on floor 345 which has some of the best views and would be a great place for a romantic dinner. There is also a Tokyo Skytree cafe on floor 350 that sells a limited selection of drinks and icecream.However I would suggest eating before or afterwards at the incredibly large food and shopping complex below the tower which has an extensive array of food choices and souvenirs. One of the best places to buy Japanese souvenirs in Tokyo!The Skytree is right next to OSHIAGE train station and apparently there is a Skytree Shuttle bus available from Haneda Airport, Tokyo station, Ueno Station and Tokyo Disney Resort.The Skytree is opened from 8am to 10pm every day. I suggest combining a visit to the Skytree with a trip to see Sensoji temple in nearby Asakusa."

You can go to the Tembo Deck on floor 350 and enjoy the spectacular views across the city, or come down a little to floor 340 and stand on the glass panels if you are good with heights! There is also the Tembo Galleria which is on floors 445- 450 but you do have to pay a second time to go up to the Galleria. One piece of advice, if you are thinking of visiting this iconic tower, try and avoid the weekends, otherwise you will have to join the long queues of Japanese also wanting to take in the spectacular views."

Me and my partner went to Skytree on the Tuesday right after the Coming of Age Day holiday, which probably explained why there was no line up at all at the ticket counter. We got our tickets in 2 minutes and was ushered to the elevators. The view up at the deck was outstanding, although the day we went was cloudy and windy with a few light flurries. We did not pay any extra $ to go up one level or enter the Star Wars attraction there. Since there was only a few people visiting the deck, we were able to take pictures to our heart content. We finished our walk in less than 40 mins and the came back down to earth, where we visited the mall. The mall was filled with many great looking eateries. We had lunch at around 11:10am at a Chinese food eatery, which was excellent. All the places began filling up by noon, so if you don't want to wait, you need to go early. We then hung around a huge and spacious Starbucks, where we were able to order a hot tea (you have to really point exactly at the menu as to what you want!). I don't think i will go up to Skytree again next time I am in Tokyo, but for sure I will visit this mall again and spend more time and energy (and money) there!"

We then paid another 1,000 Yen + to go to the next observatory higher up to see the new Star Wars themed area. Cost of transportation, ascension, and wait is near 5,000 Yen. I highly suggest other alternatives such as the Bunkyo Civic Center, Tokyo Tower, or the Tokyo government building observatory. They are far less costly and give a clearer view. (Obviously less high up.) So unless you absolutely must be at the tallest point in Tokyo, I highly recommend saving your money and going with the free / nearly free options listed above."

It is worth your time to visit here but then the queue to buy tickets are always long, regardless during the morning or evening. So if you have the patience, I would bet it would be an even greater view. It also has an ice skating rink for everyone to play. It is a great place to visit."

The Skytree is the tallest building in Tokyo 634m (2,080ft) as of 2015, and this make it the de facto place to see the panoramic view of this great city. On a good day, you can see Mt. Fuji from here. On a cloudy day, it has a different atmosphere. You may not see far, but you can still feel like you are on top of the world / or Tokyo rather. Besides the sightseeing, Tokyo Skytree is connected to a big shopping / dining structure which one can easily spend a day. This should be a must visit, if you were not afraid of height.Go early in the morning or late at night to avoid the long line. Make reservation / advanced purchase if possible."

We went on the 31st December and luckily we had a Japanese tour guide as she made a point of obtaining some ticket type pieces of paper that allocate a specific time to purchase the real tickets. We walked around the shopping mall for a while before heading back to buy our tickets. There was only a few minutes wait to get in one of the lifts and up we went. My grandchildren were delighted with some sort of Japanese children's character that was posing for photographs for free. The viewing floors were not crowded and we could easily move around and also take photo's on the glass floor section. Our visit was around 11am I think so if you're considering going, go as early as possible to avoid the crowds we saw starting to build up when we exited. The views are just great and we took many photo's. Definitely worth the time and money."

Once you have bought your ticket you'll be guided by the polite staff and jump the long queue (another perk for foreigners) the lift.I recommend going an hour before the sun sets, find a location to take some amazing pictures when the sun starts going down, you'll see the sun setting right next to Mount Fuji, people go bananas with this setting, after that the city starts to get lit up, ready your camera again and take pictures of the magnificent night views of tokyo.

A visit to this Guinness recorded landmark can be exhausting especially on a very busy weekend because this is one of the spots that are really flooded by tourists. If you want to get away of dreadfully waiting in long lines, you could always opt to purchase a \u201cFast Skytree Ticket\u201d which only cost addition JPY780 from a regular walk-in ticket price of JPY2060 (ticket prices quoted are for adults). The \u201cTEMBO DECK\u201d tickets can be purchased at the 4th floor, while the \u201cTEMBO GALLERIA\u201d tickets, which will costs additional JPY1030, can be purchased at the 350th floor. The elevator ride was really amazing, where other building\u2019s elevators goes up by floors; this one, goes up by 5 to 10 or more meters. Should you wish to have a good view of its surroundings, including Mt Fuji visit the tower during the day. Or, if you are more into city lights visit the tower during night time. There are a lot of things that you can do inside the tower, aside from shopping for souvenirs at floors 1, 5 and 345, you can eat your hearts out at Skytree Caf\u00e9 at floors 340 and 350, or have a cozy cuisine while enjoying an astonishing view from the the 345th floor. Take an \u201cair walk\u201d from 445th floor up to 450th on a 110-meter sloped with audio effects that changes together with the weather and season. Upon reaching 450th floor, be a little more adventurous by trying the \u201cSORAKARA POINT\u201d that will give you a sensation of floating, with its ethereal lighting and mirrored walls. Make sure to savor your time and capture all the moments before leaving since re-entry is not allowed. Just sway with the building and enjoy!"

And coming down is just as bad.We visited at Christamstime so imagine the crowds of local people and tourist.If you want to look out over Tokyo from a high view point then this view is for you."

Getting there from Shinjuku was fairly easy with a JR rail trip and a one stop Tokyo Metro ride.We paid extra to be in the short line to go up the elevator - which was well worth it. The top level viewing deck was more money so we didn't go up there. Only go on a clear day - we were very lucky to have amazing weather!"

We were lucky enough to have clear and sunny weather when we went there!Purchasing tickets is easy. There's also a special foreign tourist ticket sales on the fourth floor where tourists can buy tickets. However, when we there, there was almost no queue so we didn't need to. After purchasing tickets you are being led to the elevator that will take you up. Before going up there will be a mandatory check of your bags etc. However, this doesn't feel intimidating at all since the staff are incredibly polite and helpful and always with a smile.The view is just absolutely stunning! I gasped and could hardly believe what the my eyes were seeing. (That's exactly the reaction you want when visiting the tallest tower in the world, isn't it :) ) You can walk around 360 degrees and basically see entire Tokyo. We also saw a few helicopters flying around below us which was interesting. The observation deck is actually made of several floors and there is escalators. On the lowest observation deck floor there is a part of the floor that is made of glass which you can stand on and look down. This is scary but fun.. the people on the ground look like ants!You can go even higher by purchasing an extra ticket for the Temo galleria. I would recommend doing this. And there is one interesting difference about the elevator when going up to the Tembo galleria: you have an outside view unlike the elevator to the observation deck. So just going up there is fun.Tembo galleria is 450 metres above ground and nothing beats the view from up there. It's so high up that it feels like you're just in the middle between the clouds and the ground. Just to see the ground beneath you, you gotta look at basically a 90 degree angle!Be aware of that Tokyo Skytree will be closed if it's too windy, and rain doesn't help the view of course so I would check the weather forecast in advance! Other than that, there not so much to think about. Bring a zoom lens, or camcorder with a good zoom and you will get some great shots :)"

The place is prone to holiday rushes, and is increasingly getting popular, so two important things need to be factored in for a visit - Timing (early start is better), Ticket Choice (High speed or regular queue / Lower Level or Upper Level). It is highly advisable to check for visibility in the city before visiting, while it is said that on a clear day you can see upto 10 kms out, it can get far worse on some days. It is an expensive attraction, and you need to pay more for a shorter queue and to go higher. Going higher would be more of a can-do rather than a must-do as the lower level itself offers great views. Prominently the upper level features better markings and a tropical panorama shot on every window, helping to identify structures. If height is what you are looking for, then upper level is the way to go. The place is easily accessible via public transportation (tobu line)"

You can easily get to it from any place in Tokyo by using the underground train. Do consider sparing enough time for it, at least two hours, out of which 30 minutes will be spent in getting a ticket as the queue is quite long on any day. The ticket to Tembo Deck which is at a height of 350 M costs like 2000 Yen. The super fast lift takes you to the top in seconds, which is really a wonderful experience. The view from Tembo deck is beautiful, as you can see up to 87 km in any direction. Do check out the glass floor by standing on it and giving yourself a dizzying experience :-)From Tembo Deck you can get tickets to Tembo Galleria which is 450 M. The Tembo Deck has a coffee shop, photo session stand, souvenir shop and a number of electronic touchscreens providing view of complete city. You just have to place your finger on any building or landmark on the touchscreen to get info about it. You can take pics and walk around. Overall a breathtaking experience."

If you're like me, one of the first things that you quickly discover is that many businesses in Tokyo don't open until 10 or 11 AM-- and while still reeling from jet-lag, you're hard-pressed to find something to do until then. The Tokyo Skytree is that. It's fairly hard to miss (you know, with it being 2000+ feet and all), it's just a stone's throw away from Oshiage Station. The admission fee is a fair price for the experience. As soon as you arrive at the top floor you're immediate captivated by the breathtaking view of modern Tokyo. The breathtaking and picturesque scene provides the perfect opportunity to overlook the city. However, there's usually a crowd of equally eager tourists, waiting for the opportunity to take the perfect picture so be on your toes. There's are a few gift shops on each floor of the observation deck as well as a few paid professional photo services. I highly recommend this attraction for first time travelers to Tokyo.

Make sure you walk all the way around & use the interactive screens to better view the vast sprawl that is Tokyo. There are also a couple of viewing floors directly below the Tembo Deck where the crowds are a lot less hectic - try to pick a time when no public holidays or weekends are on - that should make the trip a little quicker. Also don't miss walking on the glass floor situated near the ice cream shop - a bit scary but well worth the risk!

I spent the extra money to go up to the top observation deck that was much less crowded and spent a good half hour just looking at different directions of the city. There was a slight haze when I went, otherwise I'm told you can see Mount Fuji in the distance.Afterwards, I decided to eat curry at the cafe there and got to sit right at the window so I can peer out endlessly at Tokyo while eating. Overall I enjoyed my time in the tower."

It was a 20 minute wait for tickets; a little pricey imo. The elevator ride up was fast and very quiet. Kind of wondering whether this thing was moving!! Although it was a gloomy, rainy kind of day the 360 views all around were still pretty awesome. The place was packed with tourists and locals alike. We took the train back to the city."

With that said, my experience at the Sky Tree was not a 5/5, but a 4/5 for the following reasons.1. PriceThe price of 2,500 (About $20) is a bit overpriced. You could go to the top of Roppongi Hills instead for about 800yen cheaper for almost the same view.2. LineI don't mind waiting in lines. But waiting for a full hour during the \"non rush-hour period\" for 30 minutes at the top of the tower was a bit painful.With that said, among the major high rise areas to watch the great city of Tokyo from, the Sky Tree is probably the right choice. Just be ready to wait in line whether you go during the rush-hour or non-rush hour.I also strongly recommend to check out the cafe. The quality of the food and drink are not amazing, but drinking a latte from 100+ floors high, looking down at the big city is an awesome experience."

Fuji, but it was still worth the visit. You get a 360 degree view of the city, and enjoyed spotting the attractions that we had visited or were planning to visit.It's easily accessible by train, and it's reasonably close (we walked) to some of some of the oldest temples and shrines in Tokyo. It's also close to a water taxi, which we used to take us to a Japanese garden later in the day.For international visitors, be sure to take advantage to the fast pass option to skip the lines. During our visit, that saves us A LOT of time.We visited in December, and we were surprised to see it decked out for Christmas (and Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which was to open later in week). It made for a very festive atmosphere."

We didn't anticipate to go up becos we thought the queue might be crazy. Once there we saw a sign asking people to comeback after 6pm. But luckily we were tourist, So we went and queued for a while (20mins or so) at the tourist ticket counter (I think) and decided to get the express tickets. People were really nice explaining things to us. The express queue was significantly shorter. We queued for like 10mins? And we're up. It was pretty packed but the view was awesome! There was this see-through bottom glass which was exciting to stepped on. Got tickets and queued for less then 5mins to go up to the final deck. The elevator up was see-through! It was amazing! The final deck was not as crowed and there were very \"hi-tech\" looking washrooms too :) Though the view was pretty much the same as the lower deck but we get to see more due to less crowd. There was quite a queue when we were leaving (no express queue for leaving haha) but it was really fast. So no complaints.Overall a very good experience. The queue was not as bad as I had thought. We spent probably 30-40mins there just looking around and taking some pictures."

You could choose to go up higher to a second, but considering the height you are at i doubt it's worth the extra 1000 yen."

The place is also very overcrowded and you hardly have space to have picture of your own with the view, a think that is quite annoying. You can choose to have a picture with the camera of the Skytree team in an organised place for a photo session but that will add to the all by all costs. What I also did not find nice was that I asked a staff member whether I could have 1000 yen changed for coins to use the lockers for the stuff I carried with me, I was told that I could better buy something to have my change although there was a change machine just around the corner from the place I asked exactly near the lockers.

If you're unsure about paying for the higher view upfront, there is a ticket counter on the Tembo Deck if you feel it's worth going higher. I've gone to both, and felt the higher Tembo Galleria wasn't worth it, the views are very similar. The complex at it's base is a shopping center and has many restaurants. It even has a zoo, but I decided not to check it out. I recommend going early to avoid the crowds, it you haven't bought a reserved ticket online."

The ticket costs about 2k yen to go up to the tembodeck (350m) but the wait time can be 2 hours or more depending on when your visit is. You can also pay 2.8yen for a fast track ticket and get in within 20min. Ticket to tembo galleria can be purchased at tembo deck at a cost of around 1k yen. The benefit of the galleria is that your look at is at 450m. The day we visited was very sunny and beautiful. We had an unobstructed view of the entire Tokyo and we can almost make out Mount Fuji towards the west!"

I was amazed on how the staff greeted the visitors (in Japanese) to welcome in Tokyo Skytree. It was a nice experience to see Tokyo above. Too bad it was cloudy outside as it made the inside level where I was kinda dark (not enough light to take a photo inside). Still this is a must see when you visit Tokyo. It's an amazing structure. I recommend visiting the Tokyo Skytree with Asakusa Shrine."

Not clear which lines for ticket, for elevator or not even knowing there is another corner for fast track. All queued up with lots of people.Arriving 350m, the view should be stunning, but overcrowded to get close to the window. The sky shop is so small, can't get in with too much people.Arriving 450m, the scenery is more worse, the scenic view is blocked by frame right visitors' height. Not worth the extra charges.Visited twice, on weekday and holiday, both levels are occupied by crowded. Less people on weekday, but still overcrowded.There are maps, but insufficient to identify the views right in front, you need to refer back to your paper leaflet. Old school!I prefer Mori Tower in Roppongi Hills, cheaper and easier to get tickets, lesser people, more spacious, better facilities, more clear instruction.Sometimes, its not just the height can give you fun."

First come first serve. Usually less than 15 minutes wait. One foreigner can bring up to two Japanese friends with them. Note that the tickets are 500 yen more expensive per ticket than going the usual route however you save hours of time.After you get to the 350 meter mark, you have to purchase another ticket to get to the top 450 M mark.We waited until it was a hour before sunset so we got to see the sunset and the city lights turning on. It was well worth it. Beautiful sunny day however the pollution was pretty bad so you only saw a silhouette of Mt. Fuji. Regardless the view is still spectacular and you can spend endless amount of time just looking at the surroundings.It was 3800 yen per person to the top including the 500 yen extra for the foreigner lineup bypass. Would I do this again? Probably not but it is worth doing at least once so say you were on the highest tower in the world at this time."

We stayed there until become fully dark and enjoyed the sparkling view of Tokyo city from night sky. There are two observation decks in 350m and 450m heights. After get in to 350m observation, you have to get another ticket (1030 yen per adult) to go to the second observation deck.

I was fortunate enough to visit on a cloud, haze free day which provided me great, clear views of the Toyko Metropolitan area sprawl as well as a reasonable, albeit distant view of Mt. Fuji. You can look at maps and pictures that show Tokyo but until you go up the Skytree and see it for yourself it is almost impossible to imagine how big the Tokyo area really is.The views are truly amazing, I believe it to be worth the price of admission to both floors to be able to say you saw the urban sprawl of Tokyo. If you were in a hurry you could quickly go up to say you did but it takes a fair bit of time to really understand and respect how dense and sprawled Toyko really is. My suggestion is to visit on a clear, haze free day to get the best views. I was fortunate enough to be able to catch a glimpse of Mt. Fuji, however I was told that is quite rare.There are shopping and eating areas at the base of the tower however I did not explore them in great depth.

On a clear day you can see Mount Fuji (tallest in Japan). If you don't plan on visiting Fujisan, then the tower might be worth the price. Otherwise if you still love to climb towers you can try another unimpressive tower, the Tokyo Tower (modeled after Eiffel) for less.

The subway didn't have too many business workers on that train, but I encountered a lot of school kids going to school early in the morning.I arrived at Sky Tree, walked around the area and then got in line about 7:45am. I was on the first elevator up and I had the building to myself for most of an hour. I ate some pastries at the coffee shop and then took some pictures, stood on the glass floor and looked down and went to the 450 meter level.I made an effort to get to Sky Tree as early as possible, since I knew that there would be lots of people and I do not like crowds. When I left about 10:00am, the lines were not too bad, since it was on a Tuesday morning.I thought the tower presented great views of metropolitan Tokyo and the glass floor was really cool. For me, the cost of almost 4000y was worth the effort. After that, you can catch the subway to Asakusa and Senso-ji Temple, which is just across the Sumida River."

I think it's more worthwhile to check the views from the free government building or Asahi beer tower which has a small fee."

Of course it is a very tall tower where you can look at spectacular 360 views of Tokyo, but it is also a complex that contains a big grocery store, restaurants, bars and other shops - so much stuff that it is easy to get sensory overload. This is a great place to take kids, with lots of things for them to see and do."

We went to the Tembo Deck (mid section) and still had amazing views of Tokyo. This is a great place to spend an afternoon."

If you can navigate the huge crowds that you will certainly find here and you can find your way to the right entrance and the right box office (there is a separate box office for foreign visitors so you don't need to have a reservation and can bypass the local tourists), it is worth your big dollars. yes, it is quite pricey but again, it is well worthy. You have magnificent views of the entire city and if you are lucky also of Mt. Fuji (we weren't quite so lucky!!). To access the higher observation deck (Tembo Galleria) you have to pay an additional fee which we did not do. You could visit the Skytree on a rainy day but chances are you won't see much so I would not recommend it."

The visitor lines were well managed and less than a half hour wait. There is even a foreign visitor pass you can obtain at the information desk which made the wait only about 5 minutes. The elevator cruises up to 350m in 50 seconds and it is so smooth you can hardly tell it is moving. There is a glass bottom section of the floor at 350m looking straight down the tower to the earth below. Definitely go on a clear day for the best views. Views are 360 with flour to ceiling windows. Well worth the trip to see this tower and fabulous views."

The queues looked extremely long but if you hold an international passport, there is a fast track queue although this is slightly more expensive. Make sure you visit when the weather is good, as they tend to close during really adverse conditions. It is slightly disappointing that you have to pay extra to visit a slightly higher observation tower and there isn't much more to do when you get there. Otherwise, the tower is situated within a retail complex, with an aquarium and large retail complex so there's plenty of other things to do there other than visiting the tower."

Obviously the Tokyo Skytree is magnificent to see and was not an entirely regrettable experience; however, I did not find it to be as thrilling as I had hoped. The line, while it did move relatively quickly, was still around 45 minutes, plus a short wait onto the elevators, and then another wait to get back down. The views are incredible, but they are difficult to experience with the swarming mobs of people present. It was too busy to enjoy, and we went midweek, midday, so unless there is a better time to go, I would assume it's always quite busy. Not to mention, it costs money that I didn't find worth it. We went to the tower at the government building (which is free) and had similar fantastic views, so I would personally recommend that instead."

Tokyo is so large and I much prefer personally to experience it from the ground amongst the locals. There aren't all that many amazing architectural sights from this view of Tokyo in comparison to other cities. Many many tourists, long lines, and an expensive entry fee. There's two observation decks and you're stung again for more yen if you want to head up to the highest point. If you are headed to sky tree, keep an eye out for the separate express queue for foreigners. If you're foreign you can skip the long line for an extra few yen (45 minute wait upon our visit). Fuji is rarely viewable from the observation deck. I'd personally miss the sky tree in favour of other attractions."

A short line to buy the tickets but very straightforward, then escorted to the lift. Saved about an hour wait on a Monday afternoon. At the 350m deck you can buy a ticket to go to the 450m deck, stand at the back of the lift and look up to see the way! This was another 1000 approx. yen for adults. Kids 3 and under free, older kids pay reduced rates, a few different age brackets on the website. Our kids age 3 and 5 loved it and the views were terrific!

It allows for a glimpse of the size and location of Tokyo, as the bay is clearly visible - but the overriding impression is the reach of the city - an impression that I will hold for many, many years. If you have a head for heights - including standing on the glass floor!! you cannot leave the city without going up there. My Wife cannot stand heights so she waited down below where there is more than enough for her to busy herself with judging by the number of shops to visit.Only down side is the queue to get up there - we waited in line for around 45 mins and you get the feel this could be organised better, but hey! the final result was more than you could ever expect - A visit here should be compulsory unless you have a doctor's note!!"

Didn't take long to get to the top and even though its packed, its very well managed (but then again what in Japan isn't) There is an area with a glass floor where you can take pictures of the bottom of the tower from all the way up top, quite dizzying. The basement of the tower has some nice quick-eat places. Just get a quick bite there after your visit if you want. Highly recommend it, and I would suggest, the night view is probably better, adding to the actual expanse of the gorgeous city view. Right on top of the subway station too. You really have no reason to miss out on this engineering marvel."

We paid the extra to get to the very top level, because why not. I really enjoyed it.ProTip: if you are a foreign tourist, bring your passport and you DO NOT NEED TO WAIT IN LINE. There is a special entrance for foreign tourists on the basement level where you can buy an express ticket that will bypass the lines and take you straight to the top of the tower. (If you're waiting in the snaking lines for the ticket counters at the courtyard level, you're in the wrong line.)"

If you are a foreigner go to the foreign ticket counter, a little more yen, but saves a very long wait just to buy a ticket. We came at night and the city lights were wonderful, unfortunately the weather was still unstable from the recent rains so long distant views were faded. work your way around the crowds to get a full 360 view and if you angle your camera can get pictures that don't have window reflection or distortion. For a few more Yen you can go up to the upper level, but when we were there the wait and the crowds we very clausterphobic, if the evening would have been very clear we would have gone up. After wandering around the level, eventually you will work your way down a couple of floors to the exit elevators. the wait time to go down is not that long, and then you have 7 floors of shopping to experience.The Good: great views even on a semi cloudy nightThe Bad: Lots of pushing and shoving from the crowdsThe Ugly: The wait time if you don't get an express ticket.On the scuba bubble scale of 1 to 10, I give this tower 8 bubbles for a great view"

There's another fee (about $10) to go up even higher. We went up - what the heck! The advantage is there are very few people up there relative to the main deck.The cool part was seeing the glittering city emerge in the darkness. IMHO, Tokyo in the daylight from here looks ugly. A massive concrete jungle. Much nicer at night.

I think to see Mt Fuji it would need to be a very clear day as it is quite far from the city.There are a few basic cafes up there and a restaurant, I was looking for a bar though similar to the Seattle Space Needle but couldn't find one. One cool feature besides the views is the large touchscreens that let you zoom in on various parts of the city and view them as well as get information.The line to get a ticket was almost an hour which was a bit tiring but there was free WiFi which allowed us to catch up on posting updates from earlier in the day and look into food places in the area."

Fancy display offers magnified view, day view and historical view of the skyline of Tokyo. However, being rather flat and spread out, the night view felt a little underwhelming. Day time view on a clear day that allow you to see Mount Fuji might be more interesting. Having walked around the observation desk once, I didn't think I need to pay another 1000 yen to go even higher up. In fact, I think the view from the base of the skytree on the 5th floor looking up was more breathtaking. Could have saved that 2000 yens for a nice drink and dinner at the al fresco restaurant on the 5th floor. Is the view always nicer from the top? I beg to differ at least in this particular instance. Been there, done that. Nothing more. High elevation, high price, low satisfaction.P.S. I was waiting for my godson on the 6th floor of Solamachi (the shopping mall at the base of the Skytree) and it offered a rather interesting view of trains passing by. I bought a macha softserve over ice matcha at an outlet on that floor for just over 500 yens and I think I enjoyed that almost just as much.They do offer free wifi at Solmachi but I can't keep track of how many times the connection was reset. Very annoying. They have to do something about that free (but almost useless) wifi in the mall."

Do not go there unless it's a cloudless sky, because you won't see Mount Fuji from there otherwise. However, the shopping center surrounding the Skytree was very good. Lots to see and lots to eat and experience. So there is more to do at the Skytree than just admire the view. There is no student discount, everyone over the age of 18 pays the same price. I would recommend buying tickets online, since the line can get pretty big, although it was quite effective."

They bottom of the Skytree had a little lounge type of restaurants where you are able to gaze up the tower to a point you need to get a massage on your neck the next day. Oh one thing you should definitely do is to buy a ticket for the day you are going in advance.

An attendant advised us it would be a 3 hour wait but for an extra fee we could get an express pass as a foreign visitor. (If you want to do it this way you need to have your passports with you). There was no waiting at the 'foreign visitor' ticket desk. We were then ushered to the front of what was a massive queue and after a cursory security bag check we were off in the lift. The lift whisked us upwards at a fair rate and our ears popped. The views were just breathtaking and really brought home just how big Tokyo actually is. The helpful leaflet we were given along with the numbered pillars allowed us to recognise the various landmarks and helped me get my bearings.We visited the cafes on both floors of the first station. For an extra charge you can take a second lift to the uppermost deck. We didn't bother! There are lots of opportunities to have professional photographs taken and there are also a couple of souvenir shops on the deck. Back to the entrance level there is a huge beer garden and a shopping/ leisure/ food complex. It you arrive by Metro you can enter the complex direct via a number of escalators.Note: as this is a relatively new attraction it didn't appear in a number of older guide books.Well worth the visit.... the other option would be to visit as dusk falls and watch the city light up."

The inside of the facility is amazing. The service and information is excellent. It is a well crafted touristic attraction. Even the elevator ride is well done. BUT there's really not much to do once you're up there and the fee is a bit high for a well-done elevator ride.

I went straight to the elevator which wasn't that fast compared to other skyscrapers I visited in the world. The view from up the was magnificent. Every single places (except Odaiba) were visible from the top of skytree. There were some cafe and restaurant up there but there really wasn't other things to do. I spent only around 15 minutes up there and came back down to the ground.

We went there first on an early morning and got a note which told us to come back 2.5 hours later to get into the ticket line. We gave up. We then came back two days later in the late afternoon and luckily waited only 1 hour this time to get into the line, which took us another 40+ mins to finally get the tickets. We went to the 350m deck. It's a little crowded but we expected that. The time was around dawn, and needless to say, the view was one of a kind. I later learned there was a reservation system, but it seems it's mainly designed to serve local visitors. It's clear that the capacity is far overwhelmed and the system should be improved. It takes too much trouble and time to get in, and the overcrowding hurts the experience. Many things can be done. For example, they could classify visitors based on, say, their staying time, and price the tickets accordingly. Improvements like this may make Skytree an even better place to visit."

Apparently, when visiting large international cities the thing to do is go to the top of highest building you can find, in Tokyo, that's the Sky Tree!My husband was not thrilled with the prospect of going up one of the tallest buildings in the world as he does not love heights. Just last summer we went to the very top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and the ancient elevator almost did him in. The new beautiful Sky Tree Tower with it's perfectly smooth, and ridiculously fast, elevators made the experience slightly less terrifying for my husband, and completely exhilarating for me. My husband and I planned on utilizing the foreign visitor line in order to visit the Sky Tree to reduce wait time, but found it wasn't needed on a Wednesday night in June. The regular wait line was only about ten minutes. We had to pay two times, once to get to the Tembo Deck, and another to go to the top observatory, the Tembo Galleria. The Tembo Deck had multiple floors attached by stairs and multiple cafes providing drinks, snacks, and meals. This is also where the gift shop can be found. The Tembo Galleria was less crowded and afforded some beautiful views. Both decks had bathroom access.Throughout both decks you'll find a clean, futuristic, very colorfully lit, environment with multiple picture opportunities. On the Tembo deck there is an area where the brave can stand on what seems to be plastic and look straight down to the ground below. I loved this, my height conscious husband declined to join me. I truly loved the views from both decks and the clean environment provided throughout the tower. I would happily visit again."

When I visited my Japanese friend who lives in downtown Tokyo, she showed me Tokyo Skytree from several spots: through a narrow gap between the tall buildings, between the electric poles on the narrow street, from the bank of Sumida River, etc. I also have seen it from a limousine bus from Narita Airport. It\u2019s a new landmark in Tokyo. It was opened in 2012 as the primary TV and radio broadcasting tower for the Kanto region (i.e., Tokyo and surrounding prefectures), as Tokyo Tower could no longer provide complete digital transmission.  We were not sure if we wanted to spend more than 3,000yen: 2,060yen to the 350m-observation-deck and additional 1,030yen to the 450m-observation-deck. So we settled for the free street view of the tower."

The queue wasn't that bad considering this tower is a famous spot for tourists to go to. Everything was organized. It's not that expensive either. We definitely recommend for anyone visiting Tokyo to visit the Sky tree. When you first walk out of the elevator you will just be amazed at the view. I think it's much better to go there in the night so that you see the amazing Tokyo neon lights below. If you want to see Tokyo's view in the day go to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building instead. When you go there and see all the lights it's just so breathtaking and you will fall in love with Tokyo, the world and you will just fall in love with everything. It really just felt so magical being up there. Go! Go! Go! Plus there's shopping too!!!"

The glass floor area is definitely not for those with a fear of heights. Lots of shops and eating establishments in the mall at the base of the Skytree. Two requests: First of all, if they are going to make announcement on bullhorns while standing in line, they should also do them in English. The fact the announcement is being made on such a loudspeaker makes one think it must be really important. I understood what they were saying, but other foreigners were asking \"What are they saying?\". As the announcements were not a special alert, just a repeat of what was on the multi-lingual signboards (about using the bathrooms and undergoing a bag check) those messages were sufficiently covered by the digital sign boards. I also wish they had photos or drawings of what the views would have looked like over the years. They do some of this at the Edo Museum so there are some photos to work from. I think it would add to the educational value to see how the city has changed over the centuries."

Visited the Skytree in March, went from Ebisu to Asakusa and walked across the bridge, plenty to see on the way.We just lined up with everyone else and had no trouble getting tickets.The view of Tokyo when we got out of the elevators was magnificent, the glass floor was fun if you are not uneasy with heights.There are the usual shops selling souvenirs, which we though were really nice. As you go down the escalators, there are more floors with shops (really good ones) and there is a food hall where we had lunch, nice food too, not just Japanese, for all tastes.We had a really enjoyable day, I can recommend."

The sky tree is amazing on a clear day you can see the whole city stretched out before you, sadly on our trip it was too hazy and we could not see Mount Fuji however the views we did see where amazing. We stayed until it went dark and it was wonderful to see the city in lights. If you do venture up the sky tree and stay until the evening take a sweater as the air con makes it a bit chilly. All in all a very worthwhile trip we paid the extra for the fast track ticket for foreigners, so we got to the 1st observation deck in approx 25 minutes. The queues for the ordinary pass were huge We didn't feel the need to go higher not sure what more you would see for the extra. The free wifi is a bonus."

We had no idea there was basically a huge shopping complex attached to it, but it was actually pretty cool. There were tons of great restaurants to try, and we picked up some nice gifts for ourselves and family back home. Also, visit the chocolate shop on the street level; so good! We happened to be there around the holidays, so we got to see their version of a German Christmas market. The decorations were really nice. We tried to see if we could get to the observation deck, but the line was out the door. If you're going to do it, I'd recommend buying tickets online. We were on the fence about it because tickets to the deck are quite pricey. I'd say, if you're in the area and not on a really tight budget, it's a fun place to visit. I wouldn't say it's a must-see, though."

For the view, of course, because if the weather is with you, you can see the Fuji-san during the day, and the city itself is so big that it is a good place to embrace it. Then, you are very close to Asakusa and Senso-ji (walking distance).Yes, the queue is big but there is always a way to make it shorter. First, you can buy your ticket in advance (ask to your hotel), and now, there is also a special counter for the foreigners to make it shorter (I have not experienced it, just read about it in the news). Second, you can pay a bit more and you will have access directly (or almost) to the tower (ask to the staff in blue, they will guide you). Yes, you pay more, but hell, when will you come back ? And it can sabotage your day to stay the whole day in the queue.Last point, for the kids, you have the Sumida (it will make laugh any Portuguese speaker) aquarium."

However, my suggestion is to eat well before you head to the sky tree because the food selections are limited and expensive once you head up those elevators and once you head down you cannot return back up. The shops below the \"tree\" offer quite a variety of things but are at \"tourist\" pricing. We went outside and ate at some hole in the wall ramen shop for a 1/4 of the price. Probably won't do this again except in the evening if I get a chance."

An Express Pass is available for purchase to allow you to skip the long lines, but it was not necessary. It is worth knowing that there are two tickets you can purchase: the Tembo Deck only goes 350m up; the Tembo Galleria is an additional purchase if you want to see the view from 450m. I purchased the Galleria ticket and thought it was worthwhile only because I had made it this far, I was not going to miss out on the view from the top. But it is worth knowing that there are two tickets to buy.I am glad that I went. It was an entertaining visit but I am not sure I will do it again.

However, it's great to be able to see across most of the city (I say most, as the view is impeded by the smog/clouds). It would be great if you could see Mt Fuji, I suspect you have to be lucky for that to happen. You have to pay more to go right to the top (another 1300Y) which we didn't bother doing.

For me, a viewing deck has several objectives:1) Ease of photography.2) Space for romantic couples.3) Entertainment for children.I arrived roughly 45 minutes before closing, because I got caught up in the Torigoe Matsuri, and ended up at Asakusa Station waiting for the wrong train. Anyway, when I got there--no line. I had zero wait time, on a Sunday evening. Outside, many couples were already doing their follow-up cuddling, staring up at the tower, etc. There is honestly a fine opportunity for eating and shopping below the Skytree, so you can take your time. Although, I'd recommend going to see a sunset up there, night is just as good, kind of.1) A mixed bag. There are a lot of background lights, from signage to interior lighting which really makes it hard to get a good shot except at certain parts (but the viewing deck is labelled by where you are viewing), so basically, you take photos with glare to get the full 360-degree view. In this sense, it's better to go at daylight. Also, a technique I learned in another country copying a girl next to me, you can use the glass to stabilize your camera, but here, the ceiling to floor windows are somewhat out of reach. Using just your hands to take a steady night shot is nearly impossible--as my shots showed. If you want to expand your photos and print larger sizes, bring a tripod. Even with the background lights, at least you'll get a steady shot.2) This deck definitely caters to couples, with the ability to lounge, and even camp at a certain spot with your love so easy to do--basically, everyone is doing it. If you aren't a couple, you'll find it hard to squeeze into viewing windows to get a shot. In that case, forget the tripod.3) They have many interactive touch-screens, you can even magnify what you're looking at and know exactly what's in front of you. The kids use it more like moving lily pads on water, but some people can appreciate it.There is food and drink, which close about an hour before the viewing deck closes. And there is a gift shop full of many Skytree themed items. I myself collect coins from different towers around the world, so it was nice to see these available. If anything, this is probably easiest to take photos earlier in the day, with bright sunlight outside; less clouds, more visible distance. At night, bring a tripod, but be patient for spots to open up to take photos. If you have a date, go at night. If you have a family, the daytime might be better.Anyone coming from the Tokyo direction will have to pass through the Asakusa area. If you are coming back, it's a good place for eating and drinking later than the Skytree operating hours."

The elevator wasn't crowed, and everything moved quickly.The view was amazing. One of the best I have seen. The view of the city at night was breathtaking. With relatively no crowds, we were able to take our time and enjoy the view. We didn't have to worry about finding space to take pictures, or to stare out at the city. If you plan on going to the Skytree, I recommend making it your last stop, as to avoid all the crowds and hassle. The shops and mall at the Skytree were closing by the time we got there, but we came back on a different day around 10am, and were able to get a little shopping done."

When we went to buy tickets, we realized there was a 60-90 min wait but then we found there's another queue for international visitors and we managed to get to the top of the tower in less than 15 min! The tickets for the international visitors are about 800 yen more per ticket but well worth the price since we were a traveling part of 3 adults and 5 kids under 10! It's great to go up and see the view but it was a little cloudy the day we went so we couldn't see Mt Fuji in the distance so that was a bummer."

We went on a weekday late in the afternoon and managed to avoid all the crowds most people seem to encounter, ours was a last minute decision to go so we never looked into on-line bookings etc. Only waited for 5 minutes in the line and it wasn't very crowded up the top so we had ample opportunity to get photos. I would definitely recommend going at night if possible, the view after dark was more impressive, aside from seeing the extent of the smog in the daylight. It's expensive, and costs even more if you want to go to the very top, but if you have the cash it's worth a look. If you don't then you're not really missing an essential Tokyo experience"

In order to get a ticket to go to the viewing decks you need to get a ticket which gives an allocated time to attend the ticket booth. When we arrived tickets were being issued to access it 1.5 hours later. However inside there is a fast track desk for foreign visitors which allows you to get tickets there and then and gives you priority in the lifts. This does cost extra though. If you are prepared to wait there is lots to do at ground level with numerous shops and a variety of street entertainment. Once at the top it can be very crowded but the views on a clear day are breathtaking. There is the option to pay an additional fee to go even higher but we didn't bother with this as the views were sufficient from the main observation area. There are also areas where sections of the floor are glass - there are the floor below the main viewing deck and are not for the faint hearted. Recommended."

You can get a sick view of it from the fourth floor of the Solamachi Mall at Oshiage!We went on a Saturday afternoon and was given a pass so we could come back at 7.30PM later that day. There were so many people who wanted to get up this majestic tower! Waited for about an hour to buy our ticket from the regular counter (they have a separate one for international visitors, but that costs twice as much) and another twenty minutes to get on the lift. The lines moved quickly so it wasn't that much of a deal. I expected a lift like the one at Tokyo Tower where you can see the outside as you get up, but there wasn't such a thing, sadly. Once we got out of the elevator, the third earthquake struck Tokyo and things were a little shaky, but the staff had it all under control. They just told everyone to sit down on the floor and let it pass, and I gotta say, I was quite fascinated by how everyone was taking it quite well.Afterwards, we toured the Tembo Deck and took some pictures. The night view with the city lights was just stunning. *u* It must be quite romantic if you get to go up with your special person when there aren't too many people around and you can enjoy it by yourselves! ;) I think the 2,060JPY was worth it. I loved this tower and I would definitely come back for the daytime/dusk view!"

Best to visit it is late afternoon, so you get to see the beautiful day view and night view.At the 4th floor , there is a big food court with lots of things to eat and the 1st 3 levels are choked with shops called the Solamchi. Could easily spend 6 hours here at the Skytree buildingAnd upon disembarking from the train station, on its ground level, there are also interesting street performers to watchWe were there inside the Skytree during the May 31 ..... 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Tokyo, Everybody was so calm as if nothing is going on, no hysteria at all. seems everyone has great faith in their structural integrity of their buildings, and I believe it is a just faith"

You'll also have more time for shopping later on.* Reserve your ticket online: http://www.tokyo-skytree.jp/en/reservation/Again, this is to avoid waiting - possibly for hours - in queues and crowds. It'll cost you a few more coin, but it's totally worth it.* Bring. A. Camera.* Pay the extra 1000 yen to go all the way to the top. You'll be surprised what an additional 100 meters can do to a view.

Located in Sumida easily accessible Tokyo Skytree is the highest tower in the Tokyo area commanding a view of the entire city. Bear in mind that if you plan to come you'd better do it early as the waiting time to go up can well be over 4 hours. You can spend that time in the adjacent mall or the Sumida Aquarium which is also there. Those who wish to wait less and pay less can settle for Tokyo Tower which is smaller and as such less crowded, the view from there is also well worth the visit.Skytree is quite pricy (like any other well-known attraction) but it would probably be the best photos you will take in Japan (plan your visit when it's clear and not raining). All in all the Tokyo Skytree receives the rank of 7 out of 10 on the Daniel Scale.Enjoy!"

Both were delicious!The entrance fee for the lower viewing deck (Tembo Deck at 350 m) is a whopping \u00a52,060. The wait to purchase the ticket on a Friday night seemed endless and appeared to have at least a hundred people in line at any given time. When we finally arrived to the deck, as you'd expect, there's a swarm of people taking photos. We looked for Tokyo tower, as that was seemed picture-worthy. Unfortunately, Tokyo tower is quite a distance away from Tokyo Skytree and almost blends in with other buildings if it wasn't for its color and shape. The issue with being so high up is that everything down below is tiny and blends together. You can take the escalator down a floor or two and there's a lot less people taking photos.Tokyo Skytree was actually our second option for a night view spot, the first being the \"Tokyo City View\" at the Mori Art Center in Roppongi. Tokyo tower isn't too far away from Mori Art Center and the night view there certainly seems much more impressive than Skytree's. They were closed for renovations at the time, but next time I'm in Tokyo, I'll definitely head there instead."

The lifts are so well-engineered you can barely sense that you're accelerating upwards at quite high speed. The view from the first deck is so amazing we didn't even worry about going higher up. It's a fantastic way to get a sense of Tokyo's layout, and the incredible density of the city.

You purchase at the fast ticket desk on the 4th floor, and the ticket allows you to bypass the main line for the elevators. You do pay a premium for this benefit, but lines for Skytree can get quite long so we decided it was worth it in order to make the most of our time. You'll have to assess the crowd situation on the particular day you vist to determine if the extra cost is warranted. We purchased our tickets from a helpful employee who then escorted us past the main elevator line and to the security check. Once you're up in the first observation deck, you must wait in line with everyone else if you want to continue up to the top level, as well as when you head back down. The elevator shoots you up, reaching speeds of 600 meters/minute. Once arriving at the first observation deck (350m), views of the city are fantastic. There appeared to be some jostling for space at the windows, but as we walked around the floor, we managed to find plenty of open spaces to pause and take in the experience. We opted to pay the additional charge to go up to the highest observation deck (450m). It seemed as if many people choose not to do this, as the next level was quite a bit smaller space-wise, but was much less congested. Skytree was probably the most expensive attraction that we visited, but it's a rare opportunity to look down on one of the great cities of the world from one of the tallest structures in the world. The Skytree is lit up with blue and purple lights at night. It's a pretty sight and worth checking out if you're in the area."

A guide told us that if we arrived at 8 a.m. when the doors open the line would be only 5-10 minutes. He was right.We were not the only ones who had this idea, and the place was crowded if not jam-packed. Once up on the Tembo level, we had a 20-minute wait to buy tickets for the highest observation deck. The view there was even better and less constricted by the structure itself. We were surprised that the trip up to the top was not very expensive. Seattle's Space Needle, at less than half the height, costs more. Staff members were invariably polite and cheerful. The view was wonderful although it was limited somewhat by Tokyo's pervasive haze. This gives you bragging rights for height, although the SkyTree's labels of \"Floor 350 floor\" and \"Floor 450\" are a bit silly. If you go: Plan some time for the very upscale SkyTree Mall at the base of the tower. Even if you are sick of standard shopping malls and think you've seen it all, this one will probably prove you wrong. All manner of fresh foods and plastic food join stores selling books, clothing, hats and much more."

Please note that there are two tickets option: 1) regular ticket 2) fast track ticket. Bear in mind that the fast track allows you just to skip the line to buy a regular ticket but you will in any case have to wait for the elevator. The second option costs only 800 Yen more. When we came there was a very long line at the regular ticket entrance hence we were able to skip more than 30 minutes line. But it really depends by how busy is the day when you decide to go.

We were uncannily lucky as there were no lines that evening. Enter the sky tree building and stroll around some nice shops on the ground floor. Take the escalators to the 4 the floor for buying tickets to go to the top. Buy a coffee or ice cream for yourself at the sky tree cafe on the Tembo deck before boarding the next shuttle to reach the Tembo galleria at 450 meters! That's even more exciting. I have seen quite a few towers. But this is quintessential Japanese technology in all it's glory. It's worth every yen you pay!! Don't forget to sit on the glass floor on floor 340 and take a photo looking down onto the traffic that whizzes by !"

This was of course my biggest mistake, but no fault of the venue.I paid \u00a52060 and waited anxiously for the lift. There was absolutely no queue, so if you are willing to sacrifice your view for less waiting time, go on a cloudy day. I arrived at the Tembo Observation Deck, and despite the weather, the view was still enjoyed.There was an option to pay an additional \u00a51030 to go up to the next deck, a further one-hundred meters. I think that it is terrible that this was never advertised to me until I was already 350 meters in the sky(tree); a sneaky trick to try and make me pay more.I decided not to bother, admired the view for a while longer, and then took an escalator down ten meters. There was a glass viewing point where you can freely stare at the traffic on the street below, and another area where you can actually stand on a glass platform and have your photograph taken by the staff, although you can\u2019t use your own camera. Instead, you have to pay more money to buy the photograph from the venue.The lift back to the ground exits onto the 5th floor, which is littered with gift shops. To get back to the train station, you have to walk through three floors of souvenir goods, before having to walk through a huge indoor food market.Overall, Tokyo Skytree is a nice experience, and the view is okay, but there are much cheaper options in Tokyo, and some places where a better view can be seen at no cost (Tokyo Metropolitan Government Buildings). Not good for people on a budget."

In classic Japanese fashion, they built the Tokyo Skytree in order to lay claim to the tallest self-supporting structure in the world, and made it a tourist attraction to raise revenue. Celebrating three years of existence this month, it is a breathtaking sight to behold from the ground. You can pay 2,060 yen to visit the observatory at 350 meters (higher than the 333m Tokyo Tower, which used to be the tallest artificial structure in Japan), and for an additional 1,030 yen you can go to 450m. It's cool to go all the way up but the view isn't much better. If the day is hazy or cloudy (as many days in Japan are), you will not be able to see past the vast city of Tokyo in all directions. The visual distinctions in the city structures are few, thus it is hard to pick things out. Displays help orient you and point things out but it might be a good idea to bring binoculars if you have them. Recommend visiting early in the day and during the week if possible."

At first I didn't like the 450m floor as there were bars but as you moved around there were no bars! View was amazing and it was pretty empty.After that we came down and stood on the glass floor which was cool!Overall, highly recommended!Tip: go to the west tower for shorter line if you're a visitor.

The tower is 634 metres tall and is the second tallest building in the world behind the Burg Khalifa. At the bottom is a huge seven storey shopping mall, so this is an attraction in its own right, there is also an aquarium, and ice rink and other attractions - hence the crowds.The waiting time for the tower was showing as 60-90 minutes but we decided to bite the bullet and join the massive queue - I have to say it was actually very well organised and fast moving - we joined the queue at 3.25pm and bought our tickets at 4.20pm. Tickets were 2060 yen each ( just over \u00a311.) Once we had bought them we were whisked up in one of four very fast lifts to the top. The view of the city is, as you would expect, stunning. At the top it was busy but it wasn\u2019t a problem. The area at the top is divided into 12 sectors with a very good guide to tell you what to look out for in each one. Unfortunately it was too cloudy to see Mount Fuji.It was great looking out and spotting things we decided to stay a bit and let it get dark. You are not at the top, you are at the 350m mark called the Tembo Deck could pay extra and go up to the 450M mark to the Tembo Galleria , but we didn\u2019t bother, this was high enough to see a LONG way!

The Oshiage station will lead you directly to some escalators that take you through the SkyTree shopping area and from there, you can get to the ticket counter after a brief walk through a raised walkway (or outside to get a picture!).Depending on the time that you go, you'll see a long line (1 hour + in our case), but if you're visiting Tokyo, just ask for the Fast Tourist Pass and someone will direct you to another desk. It costs about 800 yen more, but it's totally worth it since you skip the line!We were up in less than 2 minutes (fast elevator to 350m!)! I think this level was good enough and the windows were cleaner allowing for better photos. Once you're up at 350m, you can pay an additional amount (around $10?) to get to 450m via a separate elevator. From there you just follow a gradual spiral upwards to the highest manageable point, then take an elevator back down. I didn't feel like it was worth it, but to each his own!Great little diversion on a clear day and then you can shop and eat (as you can in most places in Tokyo!) to relax!"

There are 3 popular options in Tokyo: Skytree, the fairly new Tokyo Tower (Eiffel tower look alike) and for free, there's Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building Observatory (http://www.tokyometro.jp/en/attractions/metropolitan_govt_bldg/).I only did Skytree and the view was pretty awesome. We were there in the evening although we had hoped to get there for sunset (which I would recommend if you can make it because then you get day & night view). We had a coffee and just relaxed and let the view sink and it was a pretty awesome place to have a break.The thing about Skytree is that it's a fair bit out from the city. The plus is that you get to see how truly massive Tokyo is, and it is MASSIVE. The downsides are that the view is pretty much the same from anywhere up top and it doesn't give you the bird's eye view of the city you probably get from Tokyo Tower, which is in the midst of it all. A friend who has done both said she preferred Tokyo Tower. Had we planned our days/time better I would've done a free trip up the government building and a paid trip on either Skytree or Tokyo, and one at day and one at night. All in all though, you probably can't go wrong and make sure you do at least one!"

I've been wanting to come here since it opened up and the Fast Ticket option for foreigners made it accessible for me this trip. Unfortunately, there were some issues. First of all, its not so fast as there was one person working the counter for a while until a 2nd person finally started to assist. Once I got the ticket and went up, the sheer number of people pushing to get a space near the windows to take pics was ridiculous. I've been to other places like Tokyo Tower and the Shinjuku Govt Bldg Observatory which also have excellent views of the city and it was a much more pleasant experience. Then when you go back down through the shopping area, the large amount of intense shops all crowded together are a bit too much and can overwhelm you with sensory overload. Finally, the train that serves the specific Skytree station was having problems and stopped working so I had to walk a long way to Oshiage Stn. which really put me in a bad mood. While there is not doubt the views of Tokyo are very good, there simply are better options that make for a more enjoyable experience."

It is located very near the Oshiage metro station (Asakusa line). Even in the early morning, the queue was long, but the counters worked fast. After spending \u00a5 2060, I boarded the elevator which was lighted beautifully. Like any observation tower, one can spend as much time as one likes on the deck. The views are good, especially the view of the structures around Sumidagawa river. Being a cloudy day, I could not see Mt Fuji. The view gives an idea of how big the Metropolitan area of Tokyo is. There is a separate ticket for the upper deck but I did not feel the need for it. The glass floor on the deck below allows one to view the streets below directly and that was great. Overall, worth one visit."

However, international visitors are now able to pay a premium to avoid the queues. When I went, the queue was signed as being about 30 minutes so I paid the premium which got me in a lift straight away. Once you get to the 350 m level, it doesn't give you any priority in getting to the 450 m level. Luckily, the queue for that was only about 5 minutes.

Staff is super friendly and helpful and generally speaks good English.For \u00a52060 ($20) you can visit the lower deck (floors 340, 345 and 350). This'll allow you regular access to the tower. To speed up the access to the deck tou can buy a fast-track ticket for \u00a52800, this let's you skip the waiting line of over an hour for the elevators. Finally you can buy a ticket for the upper deck(floor 445 and 450 which costs an additional (\u00a51030).International visitors have a seperate queue to buy their tickets which is way shorter.I'd suggest considering visiting the sea-side top tower. It's less high but has a more awesome sky-line view (especially at night), no waiting lines, is less crowded and is cheaper (\u00a5620)."

I did not keep my receipt bu I believe we paid about $25 US or so- similar to the CN Tower in Toronto. The view is great but it is hard to relate to in terms of where you are or what you are seeing if you are a visitor. There are some displays that help but it isn't enough. You can see Mt. Fuji from the tower but I would not say that that is the worth the price of admission. In my opinion this \"experience\" should not cost more than $10 US.

The views were spectacular and on a clear day Mt. Fuji is clearly visible. The area that the Skytree is in (Asukusa) is also good for sightseeing as it is Old Tokyo, but I will save that for other reviews..."

Went here it was ok, and as others say pick a clear day to get good views, once your up their and spent 10 - 15 mins I'd had enough, once you've walked round not much else to do, we had good views and could see a fair distance. Have a look at layout of floors when up their we wanted a drink so went to skytree cafe but nowhere to seat ! , on way out came across another skytree cafe on a lower floor which had seating, so check floor plan. I thought a bit expensive but others may say different, bit of advice try to book on Internet before you go so your not stood in a queue. A lot of things are not clear, for example they have an overseas visitors desk which you'll come across on your way out after been up the tower !! And it costs more couldn't work out why ??. It is worth doing despite what I've said but make sure it's a clear day,"

Skytree tower is currently the worlds tallest non-commercial tower and as such, has become one of the perverbial tourist musts when visiting Tokyo. We waited to visit until the sky was clear (after 3 days of rain) and made a point to get there early (by 10 am via Metro). It was a mega-project and continues to be such given the massive crowd control effort in place. The views from the top are outstanding, especially on a clear day when you can see Mt. Fuji and utilize the interactive maps to locate various points of interest. As some have noted, this is a very crowed attraction and you just have to wait your turn to get close to the windows to get your shot. There are 3 levels, and in requisite glass floor (again, just have to wait patiently while everyone takes their turn as well). Noted that while our wait in the various lines was ~5 min, at 10 am, by the time we left at noon, the waits were ~45 min to 1 hr, and this on a weekday."

It is however quite crowded which makes it hard to get a glimpse of the view. To get tickets to reach the highest observation level is another 30 mins of queue time just to get into the lift. With that said, the surrounding areas around Skytree has many things to see like Solamachi and even a neat Ghibli store with a good selection of merchandise. Use the Otemachi station. You will get an unobstructed view of the tower for great photo taking opportunities."

They have tons of shops downstairs before you can even get to the level to purchase tickets. You can pay additional money to get to the higher level. There is also a full restaurant and cafe in the first, lower level area to dine at.You can reach the Skytree by taking the Asakusa (Toei) or the Hanzomon (Metro) line to the Oshiage stop.

The views over Tokyo from the top of Skytree are breathtaking to say the least and it should definitely be on the the top of any visitor's list of places to go to without a doubt.Skytree is located near Ueno, which is another famous and popular place with visitors to Tokyo, with its big beautiful park, its famous temple and it's also where you can take a cruise on the Sumida river from.I did have to wait in quite a long line to buy a ticket, but I think that was mainly due to the fact that it's one of Tokyo's newest tourist attractions and it had been open for just over a coupleof months when I went there,It was certainly well worth the wait when I stepped out of the lift and saw the amazing views,from a couple of different levels. Although I must admit that the layout ( floor plans ) were a bit confusing to begin with and there definintely wasn't enough good, clear signs and floor maps to help visitors where they were and how they could get to where they wanted to go.They say you never really understand or appreciate the actual size and layout of a city if you don't see the city from above and this is 110% true about Tokyo and the \"jaw-dropping\" views of Tokyo you get from Skytree certainly makes you fully notice and appreciate just what a huge and amazingly vast city Tokyo truly is. Some of my friends have told me that they found it difficult to believe that they were looking down on an actualcity when they were at Skytree, as to them it looked like they were looking down on a huge 3-D model of a city or a huge and vast ant farm. Skytree is definitely worth a visit and it's certainly an experience that you will always remember, but to be honest I don't think that I will go up Skytree again, except when I go there with friends and family, as it's not one of favorite or enjoyable places to go to, to get amazing views of Tokyo from. If you do go to Skytree try to make and take some time to have a look around all the various shops, cafes and restaurants around the base of Skytree and I really recommend that you try the delicious burgers at Kua Aina Bruger restaurant, near KFC, which serve the best burgers in Tokyo."

We were told that ist would be 1.5 hours in the line! Asked if you could book on line for another day - No but is you wnt to the 7Eleven shop on the other side of the road you could get a ticket reservation there. Did this but the machine is Japanese. Through signs and with persistance from the Japanese girl we achieved success. Went back the next day and entered the prioity line to get the ticket with our slip. I would suggest you do this and you can spend more time at the top than in the foyer."

If you are architecture freak like me this tower you will not regret to visit. Tho the price is a bit exp for just a view, but I gotta say up there it's really wonderful. Check the weather first before you bought the ticket. You can purchased the tickets in 7-11 or what they called there \"ConBiNi\". Too crowded especially at the ticket counter. Great elevators with the decoration of different seasons in Japan! Enjoy!"

Tourists of all types--locals, Tokyo visitors, and foreigners alike--will be waiting in line to buy a ticket and take the elevator up. When we saw the lines and how slowly they were moving, we took a raincheck. Coming back on a Thursday morning just as the Skytree opened meant we waited only 15 minutes compared to what I can only imagine would have been hours on a Saturday. An incredible view of the city, but the trip up is pricy. If you're on a budget and still want to see the city laid out in front of you, you can skip the upper deck. I didn't notice that much of a difference between the Deck and the Gallery. Keep in mind that the ticket you buy in the lobby doesn't get you to the top."

There is a charge and a bit of a line depending on what time of the day you go, but it is still very much worth the trip. I would recommend setting your expectation for 1.5 hours of time overall from the point you exit the subway to the the line, ticket purchase, photos you may want to take outside, the ride up, photos from the glass enclosure, finding the glass floor viewing area, restroom and getting back to the subway. If you are easily distracted with shopping malls or don't have a great sense of direction in skyways or escalator areas, make that 2 hours.Winter is a beautiful time to visit. There was an outdoor Bavarian style holiday market outside the day I went. The view from the tower will be dependent on the weather of course, but you can see Mt. Fuji, the busy streets, river and bridges, etc. Americans, this is similar to seeing the Space Needle in Seattle or the Stratosphere in Vegas so when in Tokyo... As with everything in Tokyo, this is also impeccably clean."

We went on a tour and the guide planned more than an hour and a half for the Tokyo Skytree which I thought would be too much. It was actually good. I would suggest giving yourself 2 hours to accommodate for lines and all there is to look at in this very large tower. If you go on a tour you don't have to wait in the long ticket line to get in but will have to wait for elevators. You go to the first platform at 350 Meters and can buy a separate ticket for a few dollars to go to the upper platform. There is an area with a glass floor so you can see just how high you are and the view is absolutely incredible. One glass wall all the way around with a full view of the city and water. There are also monitors which show you the area you are looking at and when you touch an area on the screen tell you the name of the building. Want to know if that is your hotel you are looking at? Touch it on the screen and it will tell you. I recommend going up the second elevator to the top. It is the second tallest building in the world where you can do this. Build in 20 minutes or so to go to the shops in the bottom as there are some interesting things. There are also a couple of fast food places. I think this is a must see in Tokyo. Compared to the Tokyo Tower (which looks like the Eiffel Tower but is red) it is higher, there is more to view, more information on what you are viewing, more shops and food. It is a much larger scale than Tokyo Tower if you are comparing the two."

We got there at noon and couldn't get an earlier time slot than 330pm. Once we had the timecard, we killed time around the area shopping and sight seeing. The shops here are quite nice and on one floor it is a huge cafeteria style area with some amazing foods. I could have spent hours on that floor alone trying all the different Japanese foods, drinks and pastries. Once your time is up, you head to the 4th floor with your time card and wait in a very long line for about 30 minutes to get your tickets to the first level. In my opinion this level is all you really need and you can get better photos from this level as there aren't as many beams in the way. The cost is about $17 USD. If you decide to go the 2nd level it is about another $17 USD This level isn't noticeably different from the 1st level and in my opinion is too crowded and you can't get a good photo anywhere. On the first level there is a Sky Tree cafe. Not many options but the sundae was very unique and I would recommend trying it. It's nice to eat while relaxing and taking in the view."

The ear popping lift zooms up to the observation deck and what you get is a fantastic 360 degree view of the entire city. I didn't pay the extra to go to the 2nd observation deck which is 100 meters up from the first. I would advise you to do as I did - pick a clear day before you go and visit. There would be nothing worse than going on a cloudy day with your views being obscured. I would definitely recommend going up the tower."

You arrive and are given a ticket with a time and a letter on it. This is your queue ticket and you need it to be able to join the queue to buy your ticket.My slot for the ticket queue was 4 hours from when I was given it, so I explored the rest of the complex. It has an interesting small shopping mall, some exhibitions, and a fantastic Studio Ghibli store.4 hours later, I joined the queue to buy my ticket. An hour later, I was still in the queue.After queuing for an hour and a half, I had my ticket and was waiting in another queue for the elevator.6 hours after I first arrived, I was up at the top of the Skytree! It was amazing! The view was breathtaking.Was it worth the endless queuing? Perhaps, but I'd seen Tokyo from up high before, so after 6 hours of waiting I only spent about 20 minutes on Skytree. I left feeling a little disappointed."

The views are incredible. Even if you just visit the main observation deck and it's really busy you normally don't have to wait long for someone to move along and give you a change of a great view.

For about 2060\u00a5 at the time I write this to just the 1st observatory, you can see alot more of Tokyo along with some other cool things to check out, like the panoramic Tokyo touchscreen. The panorama will give you facts and details on each part of Tokyo along with a 24 hour fast forward view of the city. There's also interesting facts to read while up there, photo ops, and as you descend the stairs, you can come upon the glass floor where you can see your feet in accordance with the Skytree down below. It's really neat. The Solamachi shops are another thing that I vouch the Skytree over Tokyo Tower. There's all sorts of shops down there along with a slew of restaurants serving ramen, takoyaki, udon, and more. P.S. when going up and down the elevator, be prepared for your ears to \"pop.\" The Skytree is very high up :PTip #2 you can get free wi-fi at Skytree by presenting ID.Tip #3 don't bother paying additional 1000~ \u00a5 to go to 2nd observatory.

Pretty much we waited in line for about half an hour for a ticket, waited in line to get in the elevator to go up, where we waited in mini lines to get a view out the window. Leaving was a nightmare, where you wait in a chaotic never ending line just to get on an escalator where you then join a another line to get back in the elevator. You then join another line to use more escalators. And it's slow. Really slow. Of our hour and a bit spent at the Skytree, probably 5-10minutes was actually spent looking at the view. All of the rest was spent waiting in lines. This was on a Sunday night in winter so I imagine summer is a nightmare.Yes, the view is really nice and probably worth it as a once off. The speed the elevator travels at is quite impressive. But I would recommend wearing comfortable shoes and maybe not doing it on a day where you have already spent a lot of time on your feet. There are very very few places to sit up there and anyone with weary feet may struggle with all the waiting and standing around. It's also really hot up there, so if going in winter be prepared to carry your layers as you wait around in lines. The view was good, but all the waiting and lack of seating kind of overshadowed the experience for us. Having to wait about 40 minutes just to exit the Skytree was a very frustrating and something we weren't expecting (not to that extent anyways).  A bit of a 'meh' experience."

Once you buy your drinks or food you can't take the food or drinks out of the eating area. You shouldn't expect being able to take a rest once you get up to the top. There's not very many places to sit down. The view is amazing though. If you go to the first section it's around $20 per person and if you want to go up to the higher part you have to pay $10 more.

I understand that you can either pre-purchase through a travel/tourism office or online but only if you have a Japanese issued credit card.

We took the metro - stop was Oshiage.Lines were short, all personnel who spoke English were easily identified with a badge, and actually sought us out, to assist. Most excellent service. The elevators were fast and kaleidoscopically fabulous. Our plans were to stay on the 350m deck; not only were we awed by the views (a faint image of Fujiyama included!!), but we found the interactive screens to be highly engrossing. Please spend time in front of these screens, as you will be rewarded with different images of what you see before you - time lapse views, zoomed views, night views. All different aspects.If you plan to go higher, then I suggest that you do so immediately upon arrival at 350m, since the lines to buy tickets for the 100 meters higher deck got longer during our visit. You can always come back down to the lower deck (I was told).You can snack or lunch at a couple of cafes, there is a gift shop and a couple of photo vignettes. In our case, the photos were decorated for Halloween, which the Japanese relished dressing for."

This really helped us know that it can be really busy so we went there as our first stop of the day and arrived around 0810 (we had woken up early due to jet lag). This was great in that there were no queues and very few people so we were able to walk straight up to the desk to get our tickets and straight onto the elevator. The fact that there weren't many people also made it great when on the observation decks as we didn't have to fight to see the view.Although it isn't very cheap (this was probably the most expensive attraction we visited in Japan) I would definitely recommend paying for the two decks."

We arrived just after 10:00 am and were amazed at the length of the queue which was meandering a long way outside the ticketing area. However, the system was very efficient and it took us about an hour in the queue to purchase our tickets. (Unfortunately we weren't able to advance purchase online as the system would not accept foreign credit cards).We bought our tickets to the 1st observation deck (at 350m height) from the main ticket office on 4th floor of the building. For those interested to get to the next level observation deck (at 450m height), the additional tickets are sold from the ticket office on the 1st deck. It was worth paying the extra and get to the next level.There were a few eating places at both decks - cafes & restaurants. We had lunch in one of the casual caf\u00e9 - reasonable price and good quality.The are a lot of other attractions in the lower floors of the large complex - interesting shops, cafes, aquarium, planetarium, and other entertainments. One can quite easily spend a leisurely day here.We were staying at The Asakusa View Hotel over the other side of the river. So it was very easy for us to get to the Skytree. The shuttle bus to the Skytree (costing 220 yen pp) had a bus stop just in front of our hotel. All in all it was a wonderful experience and the queues were not as bad as we first thought. The views were amazing and also interesting. It was a fine and clear day in Tokyo, unfortunately it was not good enough to see Mt Fuji in the distance."

Each time you get back onto the shuttle, its another 220 yen no matter how short the drive distance. We got off several times - skytree town, sensouji temple, kappabashi district and then back to Ueno. In Ueno, this shuttle stops outside of the Ueno Park exit of the JR station - when you exit the station,cross the street and walk about 50 feet to your right - there is a shuttle sign. The pay box in the shuttle does give change but its easier if you have the exact amount as you enter. Additionally, not all the drivers speak English. When it reaches skytree town, it stops literally at the door to the attraction. Catch the escalator to the ticket counter; fee was around 2000 yen. We went to the Tembo deck. The day we attended, there were at least 100 students. The attraction has a digital monitor to self read the history of the surrounding area. There's also a gift shop on the deck. The lower levels have more shops and restaurants. While the view is beautiful, I can't say I would give this attraction a score of 5 because I think its an over priced entry fee."

In most cities I visit I like to find a high vantage point to see what I can of the layout of the city.In Tokyo I was recommended by a Japanese friend to try the Sky Tree, as this is much higher, at 634 metres, than other vantage points such as the Tokyo Tower.The first time I visited was on a weekend, when I found it to be very busy, with queues having an estimated waiting time of over an hour. I decided not to go up the tower on this occasion. However, I returned a few days later, on a Tuesday, and it was much less busy, with no queue to speak of. So my first hint would be to come mid-week, if you can.There are two levels of observation deck and I would recommend paying the extra to go to the highest level (between 500 and 550 metres). It was much less crowded at this level and the views were fantastic. The only drawback on my visit was that there was a bit of a heat haze, which prevented seeing beyond the city boundaries to, for example, Mount Fuji.As with most attractions of this type, there are clear panels in the floor, so you can look straight down, although these were relatively small compared to, say, those in the Willis (formerly Sears) Tower in Chicago, so are not quite as daunting to those with mild vertigo.Overall, I would recommend the Sky Tree to anyone who, like me, likes a good high level, panoramic view."

Even the tallest buildings in the city do not provide a complete, 360 view of this sprawling metropolis. The Tokyo Skytree provides exactly that - located just outside the city center, from its decks you are able to see just how vast and developed the city is. It is breathtaking. I can only compare it to being in an airplane just after it takes off - the photos you take from the Skytree will look like airplane photos without the annoying wings in view. It is pricey to get up there but absolutely worth it if you want an unparalleled view of one of the world's most vibrant cities."

My favourite shop was the Calbee shop were you can order hot Calbee items, including a potato churro for 200yen!Definitely worth browsing through after your Skytree experience!"

            "review": "What a View!. We had heard all about Tokyo Skytree from many sites and from friends who had visited saying it was a good place to go. The views of Tokyo are absolutely fantastic! There are 2 different levels you can visit. The first level is at 350m high, and you can only pay to go up to the first level from the lobby. We didn't have to wait long to purchase tickets, but we came during the week when they weren't quite busy. We were told you want to try and purchase tickets online normally as you won't have to wait as long and typically it can get very busy. You go up to the first level and there is glass all around with spectacular views of the city, and interactive touch-screen picture displays that tell you what you are looking at when looking out the windows. When up in the 350m level, you can opt to purchase tickets to go up further to the 450m level with even more spectacular views! This is one of the tallest towers in the world, and if you aren't too afraid of heights, hey this is definitely worth a visit at least once in your lifetime if you are in Tokyo. The visit can sometimes last a few hours, and there are many restaurants and shops in a multi-level mall adjacent to the skytree that you about have to pass through to get there, especially if you are coming by subway as it goes directly there. If you think you are going to get hungry during the visit recommend eating before as there aren't really many food options at all inside, with the exception of a couple of high end restaurants (typically need reservations). The shops and restaurants before you enter the skytree in the mall are understandably a bit more expensive than outside the area, but there is a wide variety of foods and even another section of restaurants about 40 stories up or so that you can eat at with incredible views as you dine as well! Prepare to be there about half a day at least for travel, the skytree and if you want to go through the mall area. If you get the chance, go!"

Also standing very close to the tower was very impressive when you look up and this massive tower is in front of you. We went on a weekday at around 15:00 into the queue and we were at the 350m observatory at around 15:45, we went around a couple of rounds and took a lot of pictures and decided at around 16:30 to go to the top (which you have to pay additionally in the middle station). We decided there then, since we had a nice viewing spot onto downtown that we should stay and watch the sunset, which was really impressive, since you can see all the lights go on at night. I enjoyed the trip up to the top, but a) it was very crowded and it was sometimes very stressful to maintain a nice viewing spot and to enjoy the view, b) they dont sell beer before 19:00. I just wanted to sit on a chair, drink a beer and enjoy the view - next time I will have to bring my own, and c) the tower is a little bit too far away from the downtown area, it would have been more interesting to see the building from closer - but otherwise it is really impressive!"

It is good that they control the number of people going to the observation floor. The view is probably more interesting to the locals because can relate to the streets, landmarks, buildings. However, being able to see Mt. Fuji is awesome for anyone. The view of Tokyo and its surrounding areas is impressive. If you are a first time visitor to Tokyo, this place is a good place to start or finish. For additional fee, you can go to a higher level. We didn't because the view is probably the same; the only difference is the distance of objects making everything smaller and more difficult to discern. At the bottom of the tower are shops. The first several levels are restaurants and more shops. However,these areas can get very crowded. We took a taxi here, but I believe you can use one of the subway lines. Afterwards, we walked for about fifteen minutes to Asakusa temple area."

The tower stands at 634 metres and showcases the talents of the Japanese nation. The tower was built as a communication transmitter for the people of Tokyo. It is also a tourist attraction that is a must see when visiting Tokyo. The tower and its shopping and food complex is very easy to get to being about fifteen minutes from GInza. There is a need to get on to the Z line to get to Oshiage station. There is a charge to get to the lower tower observatory at 350 in height and a further charge to travel a further 100 metres higher. The views from the tower is unbeatable and on a clear day (a rarity in Tokyo unfortunately) Mt Fuji can be seen. There are souvenir shops located up on the observation deck as well as at level 5.

Japanese efficient made sure that ticket lines were quick and people were ushered into the elevators up to the viewing deck. It was really a great way to get our orientation of Tokyo and to see how vast the city is- on a clear day visitors can see Mt Fuji but unfortunately this was not our day. We paid the extra to get up to Tembo Galleria at 450m which is the highest point visitors can get to. It was definitely worth paying the extra and we had a really lovely time. We sat at the cafe to have a quick break to plan our our next stop in Tokyo. One of the cafe staff noticed this and came over to ask if we needed help..amazing staff and so friendly.

It's frustrating that as a tourist, you cannot book tickets online as you need to pay with a japanese credit card - how daft is that? I went back another day and arrived about 9.30. I only had to queue for about 10 minutes to get to the front desk. The views were pretty although if you do go early, it can be a little hazy. I always like buildings with views so it was fine. You can go for a free view of Tokyo from the Metropolitan Building which is a bit more central, but the Skytree is still worth a trip. There is a large shopping mall with lots of food stalls as well. i sat outside after my trip in the sun with a bento box and an ice cream."

The famous souvenir snack shop in Ueno is also there, but I think the price slightly higher than the original shop. We did not pay to go up the tower but it's good enough.

Try the vinegar drinks too. Weird but pleasant and they fix the moment in an odd way. The staff rattle off in Japanese and one even did her thing in English, but so quick and high pitched that we could not understand her. Sweet though.

There are also glass floor views and touristy-photos by vendors available. You are not allowed more than one trip up or down if you leave. You then must purchase a second ticket if you wish to visit the highest level, some 645 meters/levels high and worth every yen! The cost for an adult could run over $30 but it is still worth it because of the views and the exciting ride up. You can step back in the elevator/lift and look at the track as you go up for a real thrill. Probably the highest observation tower with the best view in Tokyo. There are gift shops also at the bottom level, and items throughout the shops in the walkways below if you want souvenirs, including 3D postcards. The items are quite expensive and typical souvenir items. You can take great photos of the Skytree from the base, and there is a restaurant outside that appears to have cook-yourself grills and champagne. It is important to know that you could obtain an advance ticket if you have a Japan-based credit card, or tickets from a hotel or agency BUT you may buy tickets at the site. Again, the tickets like the Empire State building in New York, require purchase to the first level where the lift/elevator stops, and then from there up to the highest level which did weed out a lot of the visitors. There were loos/toilets on the first level and they appeared to only be for physically-challenged people or parents with babies, but the guards allowed all visitors to line up and to use them."

It has its own mall with shops and resturants to keep everyone happy. Got there about 4pm and line was about an hour. Line moves quick and is inside with air conditioning (something you don't find used a lot in Japan much anymore after the earthquake of 2011) First observation deck at 350m is wonderful. Breathtaking after the 50 second elevator ride at 600m per minute. Spent some time here and knew we had to go higher. Went up to 450m and WOW just so amazing. Great photo op up top for only 1,300 yen. Some have said it is expensive. At $30 USD per person to go to the top observation deck, I think this is a great investment. I agree with others that day and night are different experiences. We were lucky enough to accidentally be there for sunset and experience both. We spent 2 hours without really noticing. Must do while in Tokyo! Also, if you are planning to do Disney, there is a shuttle from Sky tree direct to Tokyo Disney Resort. We took train all around Tokyo during the day, but this shuttle might go to skytree from Disney, not sure. Shuttle was 720 yen. Hope this information is helpful. We had friends that are locals with us that made it very easy and I thought I would try and share the information."

When you arrive, you can get a slip of paper telling you what time to start getting in line It works sort of like the FastPass system at the Disney parks, so you shouldn\u2019t need to stand in queue more than a half-hour before buying your tickets. In the meantime, you can spend time in the shopping mall directly beneath the tower. The mall is vast, covers multiple floors, and should have something to capture everyone\u2019s interest.As for the tower itself, it does get crowded at times, especially when everyone\u2019s at the window trying to take pictures, but the traffic moves along nicely. If it\u2019s too crowded, the main viewing deck offers several touch-screen panels. I went in the evening; visibility was limited by the darkness, but Tokyo is a magnificent city when lit up. In fact, I would recommend visiting Tokyo SkyTree twice: once during the day, and once at night, because both times present their own special experiences."

In my life I have visited the tallest skyscrapers in the world and lookout towers as well but the cost of a single ticket is way too expensive. Obviously, the service offered to customers is outstanding, a very fast elevator leads up to the top of the tower to the top floor in a matter of seconds, an innovative design and futuristic. For visitors there are available 2 floors, from which the view of the city is fantastic. Obviously it's all covered and surrounded by thick glass windows which are slightly inclined to allow the visitor take perfect photos without the reflection of the glass.

You see a lot of buildings and lights off in the distance, but there aren't really any particularly amazing sights to see from this point. It's crowded and the cue takes ages (or this was the case when I visited in August). Instead, go to the observation deck in the Tokyo Government Metropolitan Buildings. Open until 10pm. Free entry.

We also learned that it was so crowded that we might need to wait for hours to buy tickets. The main purpose for this new tower is to replace the Tokyo Tower for television and radio broadcast due to the high-rise buildings preventing the Tokyo Tower from providing complete digital television broadcasting coverage. Tokyo Skytree was built based on a fusion of traditional Japanese beauty and neo-futuristic design. The color of the tower is a special \u201cSkytree White\"; it is a color based on \"aijiro\", the lightest shade of Japanese traditional indigo blue. The height of the Skytree is 634 m (2,080 ft) and is the tallest, free-standing broadcasting tower in the world. The sound of the number \"634\" in old Japanese is \"mu-sa-shi\" which is a reference to the Musashi Province that once covered a large area, including Tokyo, Saitama, and a part of the Kanagawa Prefecture. It reminds Japanese that the Skytree's current location belongs to the ancient Musashi Province. It is also designated as a tower with a disaster-prevention function during times of natural disaster.We actually went there twice. The first time we visited was before the sunset, and the weather was cloudy. After we had dinner and was ready to go up to the Tembo Deck (observation deck), it started raining. We decided to visit it again on another day. The 2nd time we went was a clear night. We were surprised to find it not as crowded, and we easily purchased the tickets and went to the elevator without waiting. We purchased the Tokyo Skytree Tembo Deck Day tickets and went directly to the Tembo Deck (350 m/1148 ft height). Although it was not so crowded, there were still too many visitors around to take good photos. The night view from the deck was incredible with the entire greater Tokyo in front of you. We could easily see the Ferris wheel at Odaiba. In the beginning, I did not use the tripod because the other observation decks we visited wouldn't allow tripods. After half an hour or so, I saw one man using a tripod, and the security guard did not stop him. I was so glad that I brought my tripod with me. I took some good and clear photos. The only drawback was the window reflection; I had to find the correct angle to shoot good photos.You can go to Skytree via the subway to TOKYO SKYTREE Station or Oshiage Station. The on-site day ticket for audit is \uffe52,060. You can visit their website for more information."

We only had a few hours to spend in Tokyo so we went here and I can say that I saw the whole of Tokyo because you can literally see the whole of Tokyo if you go up this tower. If you do go you should definitely pay the extra 1000 yen and go to the 450 m level. Even more of a view. You may have to give it a miss if your scared of heights or get funny feelings at heights. Coming back down in the left I got that pressure feeling in ears you get on a plane. And was feeling a but dizzy. But it was a great experience."

Being the highest observation point in Tokyo could be a good reason to pay the Skytree a visit, though the long queue can be a bit too much, and there is now way of avoiding this unless you have a japanese credit card to buy the ticket in advance.There are 2 different observation levels, with 2 different tickets. To get to the 350m (Tembo Deck) the tickets are \u00a52060, but if you want to get to the highest point, at 450m (Tembo Galleria) you need to queue again, and pay an extra \u00a51030, that I did, although the views are not much more spectacular than in the lower level.Worth the visit if you are trying to tick the highest standing tower in the world (634m) in your list. Otherwise get to the Metropolitan Government Building, where you can get to the observation decks on both towers for free and the views are stunning too."

I think the tower has something around 650-700m from outside.The 'regular visit' actually enables you to the halfway, a floor located around 350m above the ground. Paying an extra fee, you can go to a floor 100m above.I didn't get to pay the extra, since you can see the city pretty well from the regular floor.Also, you should consider the weather and climate if you plan to visit,Anyway, the view was nice, but too crowded and expensive for a short visit (Really don't think you need more than 45 minutes to see everything there)."

The view from the 350 meter level was good, but not awesome as it was a very hazy day. If you have the opportunity, wait until it's a clear day so you can see further than the 10 miles we could see.

Lots of regular shopping too. You could make a day if it. Tonnes of entertainment for kids too. If you do make it a day, visit a cash machine first as this won't be a cheap day. My suggestion would be dash there late afternoon in time for a quick trip up before the light fades, shop before dinner then grab an ice cream if o-yatsu/ dessert and hit the outdoor area or bar for a lovely view of the tower in all it's after-dark glory."

We were under the impression we could simply buy a ticket and head up to check the view from the skytree observation deck, not true! If coming from the subway you first need to battle your way through 5 floors of over crowded shops to find your way to the entrance (allow 20 mins) you then need to take a time slot ticket which willgive you the time slot you are allowed to line up to buy a ticket. Ours was 2 hours later. Once your time comes you will need to line up for approximately 1 hour to buy the ticket. Im not sure exactly what the next step was because we gave up after 10 minutes waiting in the claustrophobic line but i assume it would only be a selection of subsequent lines, overcrowding, pushing and shoving etc. we went at 1 in the afternoon on a sunday so im sure this is worst case.

Skytree is not as well known as Tokyo Tower, and of course the Eiffel Tower, but it is twice as high as those two and Skytree is the tallest tower in the world at 634m/2080ft. During weekends and clear days, there are long lines just to buy tickets. Expect to wait from 30 minutes to 2 hours. Try to get there at 8:00 AM just when it opens. You can buy advance reservation tickets only if you have someone in Japan with a Japanese credit card. Luckily we knew someone living in Japan and had tickets ready the day before. We probably waited only 5 minutes because of the lines to get on the elevator. Costs about $20 to get to the first floor at 350m/1150ft. Additional $10 will get you to the top floor at 450m/1480ft. The view of Tokyo is unimaginably beautiful but it's actually too high up to see the details. It's like the view from an airplane. We had a binocular which really helped. There are lots of shopping and restaurants in the tower building below.If you do not know anyone in Japan and you don't want to wait long lines, you can take the JTB's Sunshine Tour and take the English guided bus which includes sightseeing of Asakusa areas and end at the Skytree. The tour costs about $65 per person and includes the admission to the first floor of the tower. You will have to buy your own additional ticket to the top floor. But this is much easier because the Skytree is not in central Tokyo and little hard to get to by subway if you are not used to it in Tokyo."

There were 3 floors that we could roam around, there were cafe, restaurants and gift shop.

You need to buy a 1000 yen ticket for the first entry which is from the 5th floor till 350 floors. The lifts are themed of various seasons in Japan and are beautiful..what is even more interesting the ride up and you will reach the 350th floor in 60 seconds...Its an amazing feeling to be watching the clock moving and you are covering floors so swiftly. The view from the 350 floor is nice..and if you are lucky you can even see the Mount Fuji from there on the clear sky night. I was visiting during the rains and wasn't lucky enough. it will cost you another 1000 yen to go to the 450 floor ...costly I must say!. Well ..in how many places can you go to the 450 floor and watch how the world outside looks? so it does make it worth a visit."

Tokyo Tower is cheaper, easier to access, and though a bit cheesy it offers a good view... as do many buildings in West Shinjuku, for little or no price. Tokyo Sky Tree offers a mid-height viewpoint for Y2,000 (about $20), then one can purchase a ticket to the highest viewpoint for Y2,400. A bit dear. The outstanding aquarium is certainly worthwhile, though also not inexpensive. Shopping is lovely, if one can spend the day and enjoy the shops, cafes, etc. it is a good time. If your time is limited, we all agreed one should spend the day in Asakusa or Ueno instead!"

Visiting the Tokyo Skytree is expensive, and you most likely will have to deal with large crowds no matter when you visit, but the views are amazing and make this a must-do attraction in Tokyo. We arrived just after 0800, when it opens, on a Saturday, and there was already a 20-minute wait time to buy tickets for the first observation deck. By the time we got up, the line to buy tickets for the second observation deck (which you can only buy once you arrive on the first deck) had over an hour wait. The views from the first deck are incredibly impressive and even though it's very crowded, the views make this a worthwhile experience. You truly get a sense for the size and layout of Tokyo. You can only buy advance tickets online if your credit card was issued in Japan. When we asked our hotel for assistance purchasing advance tickets, the concierge said we could buy a package that included tickets to the Skytree. The package we were offered was 3,700 yen per person, almost twice as much as a regular ticket (2,060 yen per person)."

The board shows 70 min wait to get your tickets, and I estimate it'd take another 30-40 mins additional which is a separate queue again to take the lift up. Decided to forgo and perhaps try it on a separate trip. Probably will be less of a wait on a weekday, but the TIP will be to book online for the tickets.. Note Online booking must be made at least 1 day before.... Being well planned will save you time for the shopping in the same building... a few hundred stores to tempt your wallet/purse !"

It was worth paying the extra to get to the top deck, though you don't see much of a difference at that height, but the crowds are thinner.Bring binoculars if you have some.Most interesting is seeing the structure itself, the layout of the observation decks and walking the spiral ramp,on the top deck."

This \"20ish minute\" wait in line turned into just over an hour in line waiting to get Tickets, Then another 25 minute wait to get into an elevator; Don't get me wrong, Not complaining, We went on a weekend and at an hour that generally meant tourists and locals a like would be here.There are two levels you are able to purchase; First stop is 350m, And second is 450m. You pay separately for both; If you want the very top, You pay more and if you just want the 350m, You pay less; We paid both anywho and took the elevator to the first stop. Just wow is all I can say. Being a clear day, We could see all of Tokyo! Beautiful views and lots to look at. It was remarkable. On this floor, You have a small takeaway place you are able to get coffee and treats; We lined up for 10 mins to get a table and had a time limit; None the less, We loved every minute of it, Taking in the views whilst looking out over Tokyo.Then we \"Attempted\" to trek up to the 450m level; It was way to busy and crowded for us to even contemplate going up to the top so we just sat back and looked out over Tokyo from the 350m mark. What a sight.If there were three things I'd tell first timers to Tokyo to do, This would be the 2nd on the list. Don't miss this, You'll regret it!"

We were fortunate enough to obtain tickets to the Sky Tree with no line and just walked up to the counter. Cost per ticket was about $20 USD or 1950 JPY. It proved to be a very memorable part of our Tokyo experience, and I would rate it as an absolute must do for any visitor to Tokyo.The views were just breathtaking and you get a good chance to see different aspects of Tokyo from the 350 meter tall first viewing area. Yes FIRST viewing area.(I will explain later). It was a overcast day when we visited and no doubt the luck of the weather will play a role in any visits as the so so weather we had meant that we couldn't see vast distances very clearly.The whole operation of the Sky Tree is very slick, with the uniformed staff (the Japanese love uniforms) uniforms themselves are very unique, almost comical fashion statement! Very professional, friendly and also very efficient in moving the crowds through. It was not crowded when we visited. The Sky Tree is celebrating its 2nd anniversary and obviously the locals are extremely proud of their new landmark. The elevators up and down were amazingly quick and smooth. As you ride to the top you can feel the pressure in your ears change! There are a number of great photo opportunities including the glass floor that you can stand on ( if you dare!) and also have your group photos taken by the photo staff at a reasonable cost (1200 JPY) for a printed photo with souvenir folder and they will also happily take a picture for you with your own camera.Once you wonder around you can use the larger interactive maps to see landmarks around Tokyo, then look out in the distance to find them. Be sure to stamp your brochure when you get to the bottom.So your ticket gets you to the main viewing area, but..... Yes for a few yen more you can go even higher! The highest viewing area will cost you an additional 1200 JPY. Lol, well, we opted not to go higher. If in Tokyo go and have a look at the Sky Tree and if you can, go up to the viewing area. If not the complex has a ton of shops, restaurants, and activities to keep you busy. The train station at the complex makes it easy to access . Have fun!"

In Tokyo, this is that tower.To start with it is prudent to know that the elevator has a glass door and people who are scared of heights (what are you doing going up a tower anyway) may feel ill at ease on the way up.The wait for the tower is a lot shorter if you purchase tickets online, that being said, going during the week ensures the line for tickets isn't excessive anyway.When up top, at no point do you feel rushed, the viewing deck is wide enough so that (during the week) you don't feel cramped, however, I would say that the traffic (even during the week) makes extensive photo sessions (with tripod, etc) a little harder then preferable - but you won't get this view elsewhere....Overall a very pleasant experience - definitely do this when in Tokyo."

( crap store but still managed to spend it.)The view from the tower is best at dusk then you get to see all the lights of tokyo come on.We went on a rather hazy day so not the best daytime viz unfortunately.Main deck was busy so it can be a fight for a space to look out the window. Also the cafe and bar take some of the 360deg view away bit of a shame.Taking good long exposure photos is not going to work, too many vibrations and lights reflecting on the glass. No tripods allowed anyway.All in all very touristy experience and hyped buy thousands wanting to get up there day and night!!!! But still it's and experience..Not my best tower in japan."

In fact, the day we were there, it was not as crowded as I anticipated and the Japanese staff were professional, very organized and made things happened in an orderly manner. The Tembo Deck at Floors 340,345and350 gave one a panaramic view of the City of Tokyo and since we fortunately had a rather clear day, the visibility was unparalleled. In fact, from my humble experience, for observation facilities like this, weather is crucial for one to decide if a visit is worthwhile. I never got tired of standing on glass floors which are getting rather common on this kind of super tall structures and you can test your courage on Level 340. In retrospect, rather than the views afforded, I was most impressed with the asthetic architecture of the tower and their ability to install vibration control to protect it from high winds and earthquakes. The developer was also clever to build a range of facilities surrounding it including aquarium, planetarium and a sizeable shopping complex with plenty of shops and eateries. Tourist can easily spend at least half or even one day on what they coined as the Tokyo Skytree Town."

The Skytree is probably a one-time thing and I doubt I would go back unless I was showing someone else the area. It's a bit crowded...we had a 40 minute wait which wasn't too bad although I would not wait any longer than 1 hour for the Skytree. The operation is smooth; the line kept moving and we were given a heads up about the 40 minute wait before getting in line. Between the Skytree and the Tokyo Tower I'd choose the Tokyo Tower.

On our way to our hotel upon arrival to Tokyo at the night time, we could see this TALL and spectacular monument from far away all lighted up and offers an amazing view. Since the following day was raining all day long, we went to this place on another day. It's strongly advisable to purchase tickets either online or with the help of a good concierge to avoid the long line unless you have plenty of free time. But be aware that the top of the tower won't be opened on a very windy day as for safety precaution. Anyway there's an Aquarium on the site and needs also to purchase tickets for entrance. It's the biggest aquarium in Tokyo.Back to the Sky Tree Tower, the architectural construction is combined with traditional and futuristic design. It raises from a pretty quiet area of Tokyo and has became the newest and hottest tourist point which offers a brand new aspect of view of the Tokyo and her suburbs . On the second part of the observatory, visitors can walk around the Tower through a 360 degree corridor which allows a feeling of walking in the sky within 0 distance.At the bottom of the Tower, there is huge market place, Solamachi, which consists three parts, the West Yard, the Tower Yard, and the East Yard. Inside there are hundreds of shops, restaurants which offer super nice souvenirs and gourmet foods. Please allow yourself at least half a day or more to enjoy this newest visiting point in Tokyo. It's easily accessible by subway to Oshiage Station and the monument is just at the exit ."

You are given a pamphlet which depicts the notable landmarks making it easy to orientate yourself with the different districts of Tokyo from the view.

If you want to go to the second observation deck at 450m you need to purchase another ticket (1000 Yen).

Try and have something with you to do whilst you wait. Once inside, the lower observation deck provides for a decent view over the surrounding area. However, it is the top observation deck that you really need to visit!With good weather it is possible to see Fujisan. I did; and at sunset, too. The sun actually set into the cone of Fujisan! Everybody cheered. Quite surreal seeing that. The overall view was fantastic. It's also dizzying to look down!As for the tower itself, it is just a tower. A superbly crafted tower, stuffed full of the usual trinkets, though there is a good supply of dearer and more worthwhile gifts. There is nothing else, other than the alcove on the top deck, raised ever so slightly to be the highest point visitors can stand at. It is just a tower; and that is why I can only grant 4 stars.It isn't cheap but, then again, what new visitor constructs are? On a good day, for a wonderful clear view of the whole of Tokyo and beyond, it is a great opportunity to stand in awe. Just be prepared to wait."

The ticket for tembo deck is 2060yen and for top level tembo galleria is 1030yen. The view is magnificent and you can see all over Tokyo. We really enjoy our time here and took lots of photos. You can also took photo with bottom glass floor where you can see the view top down. There is also a sorakara point where you can take photo with mirror both on your left and right (it create a double sequence images). Definitely recommend this to others."

I was bitterly disappointed, Sky Tree isn't in a particularly busy part of Tokyo so if this happens to you it's a long trip back to anything else you want to do.

We went at night so they city was up in lights. You can see for a great distance, and it makes for some great photo opportunities.

There are the usual screens with information etc. videos to watch as well. It is well worth the wait.Be aware though that a fellow traveller who arrived a couple of hours after me was turned away and advised to return much later in the day. Pre-booked visitors, quite reasonably, go to the front of the queue. They have of course taken the risk that visibility will be good - it was crystal clear when I went.The view of this enormous, immaculate, city is spectacular to say the least. It certainly provides you with a great overview of all the different tourist areas of the city which are clearly distinguishable from this height. I did not go to the highest observation floor as there was another long queue and frankly it is hard to see how the view could have been any better.The Sky Tree was the first place I visited whilst in Tokyo and made me feel that navigation was going to be easy, which perhaps surprisingly it is. My tip would be to go there before you do anything else.The Sky Tree is a must go attraction in my opinion especially if you are lucky enough to have clear weather."

The place as you may have read from other reviews has two levels the 350m and 450. Yes there is a fee and to get on to the 450m level you have to pay additional (Which we didn't because we were already satisfied with what we had seen on the 350m). If you're lucky (We weren't) I hear that you can even see Mt. Fuji! You can get pretty nice pictures of the view... but if you're expecting to have yourself in the picture with the view it can be a bit tricky, you'll most likely get silhouette pictures instead (unless you use your cameras flash)The place itself has souvenirs and other shops. Make sure you take pictures from the ground level too because at an angle you can get the entire thing as seen in my pics.

There is usually some waiting time, but if you are not totally agaist shopping and dining, the waiting is not a problem. We picked up our timeslot ticket at 14:00 and got a slot at 16:30-17:00. Went to have lunch an did some (window) shopping and then it was time to go and buy the actual ticket and head for the elevators. The weather that day was very windy and we had to stand in front of the elevator for some 10 - 15 min, when they were test driving empty elevators up and down. No one got up at that time and for a while it was a possibily that we can't get up at all. But we got up there and ended up staying there almost 3 h. View was just unbelivable. We saw daylight, sunset and night lights. During sunset we were sitting in the cafe and got seats directly facing Mount Fuji. Just magical.Kids went all the way up to 450 m. They said like many others that the view itself was not much different than at 350 m, but still worth going.When we first got up there, plenty of good spots were available by the windows and it was easy to move around and view different directions. After sunset the place was packed and not so easy to move around anymore. It was a Sunday and we expected Sky Tree to be crowded, but it was not too bad. Maybe because of the cold, windy weather. There was no standing in lines for us at anypoint. However we saw the space and arrangements reserved for massive ques. So, I assume sometimes there could be a lot more waiting than we experienced."

Pay 10 dollars more and climb up to 450 meters. It's worth it. Then have a drink at the Sky Tree cafe at 350 meters and relax appreciating Tokyo's landscape. Just be prepared to wait 30 min to 1 hour in line. :-)"

So, we dutifully returned at 1:30 and entered the pre-queue. This queue was the queue to queue in before we could queue up to purchase the actual ticket.After about 45 minutes we noticed that we hadn't moved and there were actually another two queues in front of us. The security queue and the lift queue. At this point we gave up and went home.My advice to people hell bent on going here is to go on any Tokyo guided tour which includes Sky Tree admission. Even if the tour sucks, you don't have to line up like plebs."

It was a great experience--to see Tokyo from 430+ meters high. Views were amazing. The con to this is that the overall waiting time and the lines to buy tickets, to go into the elevator, to go even higher, make this a once in a lifetime experience for me. Very touristy. Overcrowded. People and lines everywhere, but absolutely incredible. Food vendors and shops are everywhere, so killing time waiting for the time on your exchange card is easy to do.Notes on the whole process: If you do not book in advance, proceed to the fourth floor upon arrival. Find the tent of employees handing out flyers for time slots. Take as many as there are guests. At the time marked on your card, or slightly before, proceed to the entry way to stand in line. You may be in line for 30 minutes or more. Initial tickets are \u00a52000 per person. If you decide to go to the upper deck it is an additional \u00a51000 per person and this fee is paid when you're up in the tree. If you do book in advance, wait time is much shorter. Plan on spending the whole day here. The Skytree grounds have many shops and lots to eat. Multiple souvenir shops can be found as well.Additional notes: decide whether you want to see Tokyo during the day or the night. It makes a big difference. We were in the 4:30 bracket so we were able to see the view of day, night, and sunset."

You know what to expect being on the observation deck, 350m or 450m below see level in the huge, modern metropolis. So I don't want to write about impressions while being on top (views are just simply amazing), but more share some thoughts about organizing the trip there, as it could be tricky.So, I've been there today. Was planning to reach the top around 5pm., to see this amazing city during the day, sunrise and night. Reached SkyTree at around 4pm. and ... get inside around 6.30pm, just after sunrise. I knew that it'd be crowded, especially if the weather is good. But it's more about the system of entering. First you have to pick an exchange card with the details about an hours, when you have to be at meeting place. At 4pm I get the one for 6-6.30pm. It's good to stay around the meeting place just after entrance of the group before (in this case 5.30-6pm). But even then, you still have to wait inside the building, before all people from previous groups get their tickets. So all at all. Was there at 4pm. Got the exchange card for 6-6.30, was around the meeting place all the time and was one of the first in the queue. My group started to enter the building around 5.50 (was one of the first in the queue), collect my ticket at about 6.20, reached the top at 6.30. So calculate good if you want to reach the place at certain hour :) I think it's really worth it (I'll try once again:-)."

The breathtaking view from the deck was well worth the wait in the long line to buy our tickets. Then go down to the 340th , stand on glass floor and look straight down.

Seeing the city lit up like that at night is fantastic. I'm sure the views of the sunset would be phenomenal up there too, but i hear the crowds are pretty crazy at that time, while we had the place largely to ourselves. I felt that the glass floor bit was a little overrated - the glass section is not very big - but it might be better during the day when there's more light to see beneath you.If you're looking for great places to view the city, this is the place to go. The views are much better than the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building in Shinjuku, and for 2000 yen for the basic experience, it think it's reasonable value."

You usually go early or late and if your lucky can go straight up but for the most part like when I went - lines were massive!! You go and get a card that allows you to come back at a certain time period which is really good so you don't have to sit in line forever!There is a shopping mall attached next door which is perfect way to kill time.The view is 360degrees and they have like these interactive screens to help navigate and get your bearings of what's what.. The elevator is really fast and is like getting in a spaceship.. Pretty cool.I'd recommend going at night, we went around 4pm and got a ticket for like 7pm or something so it was dark when we up the top. The city is beautiful and all lit up. Paying the extra 1000 yen is worth going up coz your already committed at 350m but personally I would skip it.. The view in my option was worse. At that height your so much above the city that all you see is roof tops. So if your got a family or budget conscious I wouldn't feel like your missing out too much if you skipped it! But for novelty factor I can understand.If its real busy do what we did and a good way to get a photo is buy a cheap coffee/drink from the cafe and they have a area cordoned off to customers only which is pretty much empty compared to the 3 deep perimeter around the windows..Enjoy"

No wonder it will become one of the top attractions in Tripadvisor.The tallest tower in the world (634m) opened in May 2012 and can be regarded as Tokyo's greatest symbol of modernity and futuristic design. It is located near Asakusa neighbourhood.You access the tower by getting down at Oshiage station (Tobu Skytree line, Tokyo metro Hanzomon line, Toei Asakusa line, Narita Sky Access Keisei Line) or Tokyo Skytree Station. The ticket counter is on the 4th floor.We came by the end of the day, around 5pm to be sure to watch the sunset. It was excellent to see it by day and by night as well. We queued up during less than 10 minutes, and finally got our ticket to the Tembo Deck (2000Y). Add 1000Y more to get to the highest floor, Tembo Galleria (450m). They charge 500Y more for \"Advanced Purchases\". Taking the elevator is an experience by itself. You feel the pressure as if you were on a plane.Once arrived, the view is breathtaking and spreading around 360\u00b0! There is a map to help you identify all the buildings surrounding you. Tokyo looks like an urban ocean...But for those who hope to see Mount Fuji, remember that its top remain cloudy around 200 days a year...Good luck ! There are usually many visitors, so be patient as well. I was a bit disappointed by the glass floor because it's quite narrow. But still interesting though. From there, you can watch the very clever anti-seismic system than consist in a big, central pillar suspended above the ground - it absorbs the energy of the earthquake.Is Tembo Galleria worth a look ? Definitely ! Feels like being in a spacial spacecraft...Unforgettable experience.After the tour, you may go to the mall, with many fancy shops and restaurants around."

No lines at that hour, but looking at the signs and queues they have organized it seems like it could get really bad during peak hours and the weekends.That said all my doubts were forgotten once I got to the top. It really is a powerful view, to see just how expansive and dense this city is and what populations really look like. It was initially overwhelming. This was all despite it being a somewhat hazy morning, I'd imagine seeing it on a clear day or night would be that much better. They did a good job of providing info on the decks and adding some good ambiance. I paid the extra 1,000 yen to get to the highest deck,and I thought it offered a good contrast and was glad I did. I was out the door in around an hour and a half, feeling like I'd taken my time, but I definitely felt like I got my monies worth.

So far, this is the tallest tower I've visited, we've reached only up to 350m viewing deck and i would say that this is really awesome experience. We went there at almost 6pm and it has spectacular view at night, as you can also see the lights from different places. You just need to pay 2000 yen for the first level and additional 1000yen if you want to go up for more. They offer souvenirs and photoshot for free, unless if you like the picture taken by the staff of Tokyo Sky Tree you just need to pay 1200yen if Im not mistaken. We got one for souvenir. The tower itself is great with one of the fastest elevator. My ear aches as it reaches on much higher floors, but I dont mind because I know at the end of it, it would show me the spectacular views of Tokyo Metropolitan area."

When you arrive closer and closer it is really impressing!!Try to get there as early as possible because after 10 am the crowed is really impressing. A lot of Japanese tourists and foreigners of course. Go just up the the first observatory deck, you have 2 floors here to see Tokyo and surrounding area, mountains and if you have the chance, even Fujisan!!!!Really. Be patient, with the position of the sun all around views are changing.The Skytree functions like a town, up to the train level you have money exchange, tourist office and many shops including one dog shop, meaning everything you need for your dog. The view from the 45th floor is a real wonder. Tokyo is if you were in Sim city...."

The only negative is that you have to be Japanese in order to book a time/date to go up the tower. That is because the web site is the only way to do it, it is only in Japanese, and to reserve you must use a Japanese issued credit card. The only way that foreigners can visit is to join the line and take your chances. Most world class sights don't impose such restrictions, the Sky Tree should join the 21st century."

Distraught and ready to bail, a kind man approached us and gave us a reservation card for ten minutes later. We enthusiastically accepted it, and got in another big line. We were super lucky - my advice is to plan to swing by early for a reservation, then to come back.The ticket for the 350m viewing deck was 2000 yen.The elevator that took us up had a glass ceiling, which allowed us to look up and appreciate how fast it was traveling. There doesn't seem to be much between the 5th floor and the 350m level, and the entire elevator ride was less than a minute.I believe the glass floor was on this level. You can stand over 350m of nothing and look down. Pretty chilling!After spending an hour on this deck and watching the sun set, we decided to go up higher. This cost an extra 1000 yen, and involved waiting in line again, but it was completely worth it.The elevator takes you to 445m and you walk the climb the last 5m by ascending a ramp that rings the structure. The night viewing was amazing.I'd spent quite a bit of time in Tokyo, but I'd never appreciated its true scale as one of the ant-like people below, crossing streets and exiting subway stations. From here, you could see that the tall buildings just keep going off into the distance. It really is a sprawling metropolis!"

But the line moves, and if you know about it in advance, it won't take you by surprise to know you have to allow for it. There is a restaurant at the 350 meter level (Skytree Restaurant 634) that takes reservations, and it would have been a pleasant way to end our visit had we known. But the day we went, the restaurant was fully booked. However, there are several restaurants on the lower levels (6th and 7th floors) and we found a very good tempura spot. If you don't know Tokyo, it is difficult to pick out specific landmarks, but the views give you some idea of the magnitude of the city. We waited in line a lot longer than we actually spent on the 350 meter and 450 meter levels, but we all thought it was worth the trip.

I didn't bother going to the higher observation deck so I don't really know what I missed. The glass floor tiles were interesting but smaller than I was anticipating. Bathrooms at the top are the clean, Toto toilet equipped facilities, that unbelievably were empty (for Men's at least).At the bottom of the tower, there's a lot of shops to go through selling every imaginable Sky Tree-related paraphernalia. Needless to say, we dashed for the exit to escape the crowds.Overall, it was an interesting attraction. Granted, it's not cheap, but the views are fantastic and it's a pretty cool tower.

That alone was worth the price of admission, which is admittedly high. Don't pay extra to go to the secondary observatory, as the base itself is good enough."

Try and get there for sunset and take in the bay and Fuji in the distance with its changing moods and hues. Unfortunately everyone else will have the same idea. The day we went the queues were horrendous, we waited over 2 hours and perhaps they should have put a little bit more effort in entertaining the lines, Disney style, to alleviate the boredom and built up the anticipation. You don't actually get to the top on the first go, you are about three quarters of the way up at the main level and you get the opportunity to buy tickets to the highest level. Again the queues here were shocking. The whole operation to go up and come back would've probably taken us 4 hours or so and a good few quid. Not cheap.It's also located on a slightly outlying area of Tokyo a fair walk from the Metro station though it does have its own premium line that links it to the city.Saying all that it's a must, after all it is the highest tower in the world though the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is nearly 200 metres higher"

It is located about a half mile east of Asakusa and the Sumida River (five to six miles northeast of central Tokyo.) The Tower is about 2,100 feet high and is the 2nd tallest structure in the world (it\u2019s the tallest tower in the world).I went about 5 PM on a Sunday evening and the place was very crowded. The process to buy a same day ticket was very confusing as there appear to be several lines. I stood in a couple of lines and gave up as I was not sure what I was doing. Plus I heard the wait could be 2-3 hours long and for me it was not worth the wait. The Skytree website says you can buy advance tickets if you have a credit card issued in Japan (that is not very helpful). My US AMEX card worked every time I tried it in Japan but for some reason it won\u2019t work on the Skytree website. If I ever go back I will go early in the morning when the line is reported to be very short.Even though I did not have the time or motivation to go to the top, I enjoyed my visit and think the Skytree is nice to look at from the ground. The structure looks very complicated as you can see the inner part of the Tower from the ticket office level. I am not an engineer but think this is an impressive engineering marvel. Overall I enjoyed my trip to the Tokyo Skytree and recommend it if you are visiting Tokyo for more than one or two days. My only complaint was the overly complicated process to purchase a ticket."

So I do not recommend going up if the weather is not the best.

Was anticipating the view, and being a clear day, we were hoping to see a different view of Mt Fuji. Once you get into the queue to purchase tickets, there is no sitting down or breaks you can take without losing your spot. I was glad my parents were able to get through ok. I must say that crowd-control was executed well, because when we finally get up to 350 metres, it wasn't as crowded as what it was like downstairs, and we didn't have to squeeze to have a proper view of the skyline. We were able to walk around without any pushing or shoving. The view was breathtaking, particularly on a clear day, but was very disappointed not to see even a vague silhouette of Mt Fuji. We were able to identify some key spots with the help of the map, but otherwise, we would never had known. We had wanted to go up to 450 metres, but was discouraged by yet another queue to purchase the tickets (you cannot buy this at ground floor) and we figured the view would be similar so we went back down. To get down, you need to walk down a few flights of steps (2-3 floors), which is fun, as you will be able to step on the \"glass corridor\" to see the view right down. While it's a little costly to get up I would still recommend it. I'm just not sure if waiting more than what we had waited was worth the while. During the queue I did some search and it seems you can buy tickets online or via travel agencies - if this is possible, would highly recommend it, as the queue would only be limited to going up, which would be no more than a 15-30 minutes wait."

We felt very comfortable with the tokyo train system, with money, with asking for help, with navigation, with everything. Yet this is one of the few places that felt amazingly difficult to get to, considering it's visible from 10 miles away minimum. I like that they made a train station stop specifically for this place, but the train that goes here is not in the main JR station and is confusing and not well marked. Even many people who spoke Japanese had to ask if they were on the right train. There were people on our train from: China, Malaysia, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, America, as well as others. The fact that there is not signage in more than Japanese and English is astonishing- do they want to make money or not? Upon exiting the train there is almost no signage on how to access the main entrance to the Skytree. We walked around for a good 10 minutes before finding it; keep in mind the station is UNDER the Sky Tree, there is no doubt where it is at any given moment. The wait was very small and it was very efficient like most things in Tokyo. It was $20/person. It was very cloudy the day we visited but we still got a good view. I personally wanted to go up to the next platform for the extra $10 but the wait was very, very long. There are many places to eat here, both on the ground and above. We had a good time taking pictures and then walked around the extensive mall and ate in the very passable food court. You can get a Sky Tree baumkuchen, or a waterbottle, etc. I think this is a good place to come because it's technically *the* tallest tower on Earth (Burj Khalifa is not a tower) and they have great descriptions of what you can see and where, and what the area looked like in previous Japanese historical eras. It takes a good hour to get here from most areas of the city, so do this in the morning, take a break for lunch, and then go see the historic temples in nearby Akasuka."

It's amazing to see how huge this city is.  Warning lines are very long. If you stay at certain hotels known as friends of the Sky Tree you can get a bypass admission and it's free. You still have to pay the extra $10 to go to the higher level. We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Ginza which is one of those hotels. Plus it's a great hotel!"

You can avoid it if you come with a tourist group or if you have online ticket reservation. Also, time your visit late in the afternoon so you can enjoy day and night scenery. If you consider commuting by public transport, take Yamanote or Keihin Tohuko train to Ueno JR station, take the exit to ueno park. Just in front of the information office you will find the Skytree shuttle bus stop which will take right to the Skytree."

There were long queues for photo spots, and you couldn't really take your time. It also seems silly that you have to buy your ticket for the Tembo Galleria at 450m while you're up there. There was a long queue, so we didn't bother as we had other things to do that day. I don't understand why you can't buy your ticket for the top level at the same time as your main ticket.

It feels very much like what it is, an over priced tourist attraction. You enter via a concrete landscape, there's a large food court at one end and a multi level shopping centre, with more food establishments, at the other. You then join a queue, I went during the week out side of holiday season and the first queue was just over an hour, this weaves you around the snaking rope cordon to the ticket desk. Apart from a couple of display screens the only thing to see is the other people in the queue!! Expensive ticket purchased, you then join the queue for the security check. Once complete, you join the queue for the lift!!Ahhh the lift arrives, and brings with it the first part of interest since entering the building! I can only describe this lift as opulent and fast!! 350 meters and an ear popping minute later you emerge onto the Tembo Deck. The views are vast, Shinjuku, the docks and more clearly visible, sadly too hazy to see Fuji san on the day I visited. There's an expensive caf\u00e9 and rather pleasant toilets should you wish. There are crowds and you might have to wait for a window space to grab a photo or two, but you don't feel rushed or crowded. I then joined another queue, this was to purchase a ticket for the next part of the trip, thankfully this queue was much shorter than those on ground level, I can only assume only a fraction of the visitors felt it was worth paying out again to go another 100 meters up! Ticket purchased and another short queue later I'm in a lift again. This one whips you up the outer part of the tower and the views from it are quite incredible. Doors open and you enter the Tembo Galleria. Floor to ceiling windows surround this circular walkway, and it may have just been my imagination, but it felt like the whole thing wobbled as you walked!!The views remained fantastic and again there was no pressure to rush around. Oh, and there was a small queue to cross the glass floor. Back down at the bottom, there are plenty of gift shops and food areas available. I also enjoyed walking around the back streets by the Sky Tree, this is one of the poorer areas of Tokyo and it is hoped this development will help with the regeneration. It's by no means a slum area or dangerous but it's certainly not Roppongi Hills! If you want great views for free, head to the Metropolitan Government Building in Shinjuku. However, if you want to experience the tallest tower in the world and don't mind queuing and paying, head here."

Be aware that there is always a long line--we were lucky because if you go to the restaurant, there is no charge for the elevator ride (which is pretty awesome in itself) and you bypass the line for the elevator up. There are tons of shops--you could get lost there! And getting there is very easy by metro, where it's the last stop on the Asakusa Line. A good one-time spot not to miss."

(If you don't know whether you like them, go to Tokyo metropolitan building first and save 2000 Yen + 1000 for the galleria.) However, there are plenty of shops and restaurants in the building so this may come handy. If at least a bit possible, make a reservation for a specific time beforehand to avoid long(!) waiting. Without this, I'm not sure it's really worth the waiting time and the price. (But sometimes there are almost no people waiting so you may able to go directly inside.)Besides the price and the waiting time, the only real drawback is that there is no information about the visibility conditions on the bottom floor, only on the intermediate, so be careful, otherwise you may end up with paying a lot for a poor view (at least I didn't notice one)."

Standing at 643m, tallest tower in the world, the viewing decks are at 350 and 450m. The panoramic view beats any skyscraper observatories and the interactive touch-screen panels are a bonus to identifying the landmarks. On a clear day you can see mountain ranges and Fujiyama but no such luck for me. The glass floor to stand on is rather tiny. If only they had built an entire glads deck to stand on like the one in Auckland. Lots of shops in the gallery to keep the shopaholic happy, too."

I had been told that there was weeks long waiting to go up, but I arrived around 9am (they open at 8) and I waited in a very short queue for a ticket that takes you up about 450 meters. The elevator up is so smooth! You climb all the way up so quickly it takes less than a minute to arrive at the first stop and you don't even feel like you are moving! The view from up there is great, the only issue is that the day was not very clear so it was hard to see much, on a clear day you are supposed to be able to see all the way to Mt. Fuji. I was easily able also to buy the second ticket that takes you up another 200 meters. It was worth the money it was a fun adventure and I think most people would really enjoy it."

When you arrive, you have to get a ticket which tells you which time block you have been given to actually go into the SkyTRee building - depending on day of week etc will dictate how long you have to wait. However there are plenty of things to do while you wait - shops and restaurants. When it is time to go in, everything is very well organised and you go up in a fast lift up to the top. Once there, you can pay extra to up to a higher level - I felt this was unnecessary as the view from the first level is great. The building is so tall that you feel like you are looking down over the rest of Tokyo, even the other skyscrapers are dwarfed. There is a small piece of clear perspex that you can stand on and see all the way down which is fun. All in all, I really enjoyed my day here and would go again!"

The Tokyo Skytree can be reached directly from this station, just follow the hords of people.The Tokyo Skytree is the second tallest building in the world, tallest TV-tower in the world and the tallest building of Japan, measuring 634 meters. On the base of the tower, a complete mall with all kinds of stores is built (Tokyo Skytree Town). This mall is very crowded with lots of people. You can get some good view from the Skytree from one of the various outdoor areas of the mall, which is very nice. The mall features a specific floor in which you can \"Experience Japan\", it features numerous shops with Japanese souvenirs. The surroundings of the Skytree are nice as well, there is a small water feature running along the side of the Tokyo Skytree Town, which is more quiet than the Skytree Town itself. It is a good place to relax and just walk around. The Tokyo Skytree consists of two observatories at respectively 350 (Tembo Deck) and 450 (Tembo Galleria) meters above the ground. Tickets for the Tembo Deck will cost you 2000 JPY while an additional 1000 JPY is charge when accessing the Tembo Galleria. Note that tickets for the Tembo Galleria can only be purchased at the Tembo Deck. The Skytree itself is very busy as well. I advise you to buy your tickets beforehand through the internet since on most days slips are handed out to people to come back at a specific time later that day to try and buy a ticket, this is due to the fact that the Skytree still is extremely busy. Due to this fact, we didn't access the Skytree, which was a pitty to me. Therefore, be sure to buy your tickets prior to visiting. If you really want to visit the observation deck you have to come back at the time assigned to your slip."

So partly my own fault, but unlike everything else in Japan, this seemed less well organised.The views are good, but I'd recommend waiting for a clear day.

However, beware it isnt cheap to go 3/4 of the way up and then you have to pay more to go to the top. If you have a really good camera, you will get some amazing pictures and you CAN say you have been up a really tall tower (its one of the tallest in the world). But my family and I were left thinking \"was that it??!?\". The queues were really big and waiting times moderate (30-45mins). I have to admit, the efficiency and organisation of the customer service staff was excellent, but it was tiring standing around for a long time (especially for my parents 60+). The observation deck provides beautiful views yes - but as mentioned - have a really good camera (SLR) and you will really get some amazing shots. Id recommend going early in the morning when (as some of the staff said) you may capture views of Fuji and beyond. We went midday and this was not possible. It was also super crowded and finding a nice point for a photo was tricky. As you may imagine, the cafe in the deck is accordingly priced for a tourist.All in all - this is a \"tick in the box\". If you want to experience it at a price. If you want a view of the city - there are many FREE places you can go and get something a bit better :) :)"

The Tokyo Sky Tree is truly an engineering marvel. Standing high above the city's skyline, it is an imposing sight that beckons to be visited. Unfortunately for us, it seemed every unoccupied Tokyo visitor who was Japanese or every other nationality had the same idea on that day.We went there by train from Asakusa Station to Tokyo Sky Tree Station hoping to get up there and enjoy the panoramic views. It turned out to be that we had to pick up a ticket for a 19.00 hrs. viewing time, which was about 3 hours away. That made us get a sense of how popular this place was. Once the appointed time came, we had to wait in line for 30 minutes more to buy tickets, then wait for elevators. Granted, these were super fast elevators, but were so full we could not move an inch.When we got to the observation deck, it was dark, and full of people. I mean the place was crowded like a train station of passengers heading home for the holidays. I myself could not even find space to see or take photos of the city. What I eventually did see were shimmering lights and roads way down below. I was never a fan of going up high buildings for photos and Tokyo Sky Tree did nothing to change my mind. If you go, allow plenty of time. At least there are fine restaurants and decent shopping in the complex, but even those are jam packed."

The crowd was rather thin that day so I did not have to wait for long to get a good look of the view by the windows but I can't imagine what it would be like on a more crowded day or the more popular times of the day. I also wish there were some seating areas; maybe visitors are not expected to linger around. I did not stay for long. To have a better experience, choose a bright day or opt to go during the night or to watch the sunset (I have seen some very beautiful shots of the sunset from Tokyo Sky Tree). The tower is accessible from several subway lines or you can consider what I did - combine a visit to the tower with a visit to the Tsukiji market followed by Asakusa and possibly the Ameyoko market in Ueno if time permits."

It does \"tower\" above Tokyo Tower and well worth a visit. It is quite the popular destination these days, even among the locals. As to \"towering\" and height, I will let you google that, but depending on how it is measured, it is the second tallest structure in the world. Again, this depends on certain criteria (antenna height, etc.) but suffice it to say it is indeed an impressive structure. Beauty? That is in the eye of the holder, however. If you are in Tokyo it is well worth the trip since it is in Tokyo as well. The night view of and from the Tower is impressive as the Tower is well-lighted. River tours are available and perhaps give another fun dimension to a visit. Upper decks of the tower include restaurants. If you would rather save some money, why you can just pick up something to eat and drink at the convenience store in the station before heading to the tower itself. Enjoying Sky Tree itself really requires little money and can be done economically. Those who wish to ride to the \"top\" will pay a ticket fee however."

The view was amazing and it took no time to get to 450m on the elevator! I read many comments about long queues but I got there on a Tuesday at 9am (they open at 8am) and there was no queue, so we went straight in.One annoying thing is that you basically have to buy two tickets if you want to go to the very top, and they are both quite expensive. The view is amazing and everything looks new and exciting, but I still thought it was a little too much to pay. I really liked the shop too, where you can buy interesting souvenirs and postcards. Also, the whole area around the Sky Tree is a shopping centre, so there are many places where to go and eat afterwards."

The building's sheer size and magnitude are truly awesome from the outside, and the surrounding facilities provide ample things to do for almost an entire day. The lineup to get into the tower can be a bit long, and the process to get up slow, including going through a bag check and metal detector. But the entire process through i was distracted by a variety of creative info panels, and very nice interiors and lighting. The elevators up are very beautifully decorated, but a wish it was a bit more interactive then just simply displaying your accent speed. Once up top, the view is grand, but to get the best view, you must be very lucky, smog often clouds the distant view. Your best bet is a windy winter day in the early morning, but for me it was summer, and for the 25 days I was there, 1 day was a beautiful perfect day with an endless view, however on an average day the smog of the city wont let you see too far. Regardless its still a great view, which will allow you to see the scope and size of Tokyo. There are plenty of interactive panels to let you identify spots your looking at and the glass is extremely clean, transparent and glare free, so I had no issues taking photos.  Now to get to the very highest level you have to once again pay, wait in line and go up an elevator, this time the elevator being quite boring. I went up just for novelty because up there the view didn't change drastically, and I couldn't see any further. You basically pay to go up this ramp that goes from the elevator to a spot marked \"highest point\" and aside from a bit of picture taking and waiting to see if the weather got any better we didn't spend much time up there.  Back in the main level, we did use the cafe, which had decent cake and coffee/tea. We took a look at the restaurant, but prices were about $40 for the basic course meal, not outrageous for Tokyo. The merchandise shop offered a variety of things all priced at attraction rates (high). One of my favorite spots was the glass floor which the positioned and created perfectly! We took some very cool pictures with the glass bottom, and the picture service by the staff also worked out well.  All in all it was a very good experience for a tower, although on the pricy side considering its just a tower."

The view is spectacular at night. I didn't go to the upper deck, but I'm not sure if it's really all that necessary. The view from the general deck (you get access to three levels if you pay the general admission) really shows off Tokyo very well. I appreciated the fact that it was entirely indoors and enclosed with glass, which is a lot better than outdoor decks fenced with wire nets that obstruct the view.There are a lot of touchscreens that help explain and navigate the view of the city and what you're looking at. You can even compare day and night view on the screens. Also, there was also a comparison of a map drawn centuries ago to the view today atop the SkyTree---the historical perspective was interesting.The gift shop was somewhat of a rip-off (typical of most tourist traps). You can find a somewhat better deal for Tokyo Skytree souvenirs in the mall at the foot of the tower, and surrounding areas."

Having been up the TMGO (loved it), the Mori tower in Roppongi (meh) and Tokyo Tower (loved it), I was dragged along to this by my travelling companions.We didnt have a Japanese credit card, so there was no way of avoiding the crowds. We waiting almost an hour just to buy the ticket. 2000 yen. Another 10 minutes for the elevator. Cut to- an overly crowded observation deck, basically too high to see much and too far from most of the other city landmarks. I guess once you get up high enough past a certain point the view doesnt really get better.. Just say sprawl of the buildings. Paid another 1000 yen to go to the higher one, similarly crowded with people, had to wait a few minutes just to get a spot at the windows. Not much to do up there, an overpriced gift shop, some overpriced food venues, to match with the overpriced view.They have a glass floor, but it was getting dark by this stage, so the effect was not so amazing, you could just see a bit of the tower below and some bright lights shining up at you. Plus you had to fight with fifty other people to get onto it or take photos there.Then we waited another twenty minutes for the elevators down. I dont know if everyone else felt as ripped off as I did as we were leaving. Yes, I can say I have been up the Tokyo Skytree, so if you just want to do it for the sake of doing it, then great. I would recommend the older, shorter yet cheaper and more enjoyable Tokyo Tower."

I arrived at about 10am on a Sunday and got a coupon for entry between 12:30 - 1:30pm (if i recall correctly). So about 30mins prior to entry time, you can start queuing to purchase tickets before going up the elevator. Despite the crowds, it was all smooth and fast. You don't have to wait too long in the queue. The timed entry system is excellent in controlling crowd and queue. While waiting for your time entrance, you can walk around Tokyo Sky Tree City which is basically a big shopping mall with lots of shopping and dining options."

Unless you are in Shibuya, where this line starts, you will need to refer to a subway map to find a connecting line from where you are staying. From the Shinjuku area, take the JR Chou line (free with your JR Rail Pass), to Kinshicho, then change for the Hanzomon line to Oshiage. The Tokyo Skytree is in a big complex also called Solamachi. The most popular ticket is to the Tembo Deck, that is the first observatory, 2,000 Yen, higher up it is 3,000 Yen, adult tickets. We chose a clear beautiful day so as to have a great view, however it was very windy that day, and when we arrived were informed the tower was closed because of the wind. The staff informed us to go to the Solamachi building which is part of the complex, and go up the 31st floor (top floor) and we would get a great view. This floor and the 30th are restaurant floors but one side did offer great views of the city and the entire complex below, including the river that flows thru the area. If you experience long delays for the tower, I would recommend this option as it offers great views and it is free. At the complex there is also the Sumida Aquarium and the Konica Minolta Planetarium. There are literally hundreds of restaurants to satisfy all tastes, and a vast mall for shopping. The Tokyo Skytree is a definite visit for your stay in Tokyo."

Once you get your ticket to the top, the staff is very helpful in getting up to the top. When the doors to the elevator open, I saw the most spectacular metro vista I have ever seen and I couldn't get enough of it. You're nearly 1,500 feet above Tokyo and it doesn't matter if it is hazy, clear, cloudy, day or night, Tokyo Skytree provides a great view for all those who go to the top. For me, the Skytree also provided a once in a lifetime chance to stand 1,500 feet above something and it is an experience that I will never forget.

The elevator ride is very entertaining and there are graphics which tell you interesting facts and how long/far it is until you reach your destination (stop). There are four elevators, one for each season and have appropriate graphics for the seasons. Once in the viewing area, you walk around and can look around and there are very helpful maps which tell you exactly what you are looking at in the ceiling to floor glass windows.

            "review": "Tokyo Skytree: a view full of wonder!. Tokyo Sky Tree was still under construction during my visit in March of 2012, so upon returning a year later- I had a visit to the Sky Tree on my must see list. Now for some reason I thought I could arrive there, get in line and wait a little while and before too long I'd be whisked away upwards toward the heavens. Well...not quite. the Japanese have nearly perfected the concept of queueing, waiting, shepherding and all around crowd control, meaning that when I arrived (on a Thursday) at 12:30 PM I was welcomed by seemingly thousands of others who had shown up. After a bit of wandering around and acclimating to the new surroundings I was instructed to get a reservation card which dictated a time for me to return in order to queue up to actually buy a ticket-whereby I would get in another line before finally being the aforementioned whisked. My time to return: between 3:30 and 4:00-now to kill three plus hours. I'm not complaining about the process, actually its a marvel to witness it in action, otherwise we have a disorganized mess to contend with. Now on previous trips to Tokyo I have had the occasion to visit the Mori tower, the Tokyo Tower, Sunshine 60 building and Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, all with their own observation decks and all offering their own impressive views and other niceties. But the new Sky Tree stands apart-not only is it the new standard in height but since it encompasses all the others (in it's own view) and assumes a sentry position on the east side commanding a presence that the others can't achieve. The view is stunning! The $20.00 (give or take depending on current exchange rates with Yen) to go skyward 350 meters is worthwhile. Orienting oneself to the lay of the land is assisted through the use of maps displayed in the viewer's oriented direction. In addition, some offer virtual displays of Tokyo at various times of the day and year-highlighting the visual fest to the eyes that occur in Tokyo during the 4 seasons. There is even a section that has a glass bottom floor for a direct below view, although it is small and a bit underwhelming as a result, but it does allow for a hint at the actual inner workings of the structure itself. Given its location near the Sumida river it is easy to access from most anywhere in Tokyo, and is certainly recognizable for anywhere in Tokyo as well. For those looking for places to go while in Tokyo-the Sky Tree beckons! Resist at your peril or just visit-you'll be glad you did."

It's an impressive architectural masterpiece. I couldn't book tickets online and took to queuing for the day ticket to the Temba Deck which was located at 350 meters. The queue was massive but moved quickly and we were able to purchase our tickets within 30 mins. The 360 degree view of the city was an eye opener, unfortunately it was misty on the day of our visit and we couldn't see Mt Fuji from he deck. It's definitely worth a visit!You could purchase another ticket at the Temba Deck which will allow you to visit the Temba Gallery which is located at 450meters. For more information on ticket fees go here http://www.tokyo-skytree.jp/en/index.htmlYou have the option to visit the Sumida aquarium if you are with kids. Refuel at the Tokyo Solamachi with food and more shopping after the viewing."

There is a big souvenir shop on all things Sky Tree on the lower floors of the mall.

When you get to the first level the doors open with a beam of light and your greeted by the staff when you walk out. The view was amazing to say the least. I paid another 750 yen to get my photo taken by the staff and have it printed just for a nice soviernier. I walked around the entire first level to take in the sights. You could pay another 1000 yen to go up to the highest level but i didn't bother. while your there you can have light refreshments from there cafe but this seemed very expensive as you can imagine. Some parts of the floor are glass so you can see the drop beneath you !A must visit if your in Tokyo but because this tower is still very new, it will be busy so get there early if you can."

Although organized, we were BLESSED that we didn't go on a busy day. First, you have to get a ticket to GET a ticket. The first ticket is the \"get in line\" with a time on the ticket (our time was 6:30 pm) so at 4 pm we were walking around the many shops and eating establishments. When it was time to get in line to pay, it moved quickly like a amusement park ride. The cost is 10 dollars or 1000 yen to see the 'middle section' section of the tower. To get to the top is ANOTHER 1000 yen; I guess some people don't want to go to the very top for fear of heights, but if you've gone this far, why not continue on? So I paid the other 1000 yen to get to the second set of windows near the very top, and the views were spectacular. There were coffee shops and souvenir stores on both floors, as well. The train station was conveniently located close to the tower which made it much more enjoyable. The train, trolley and subway stations are quite confusing but if you just ask any attendant, they will help you with no problem. Tokyo is so user friendly and I really enjoyed my visit to the \"world's tallest tower\""

I'm sure on a nice clear day you could probably see to Fuji and beyond, but just the view of Tokyo itself was pretty amazing.You have to get a timed ticket which will then allow you to queue up and buy the actual ticket. We went on a Sunday afternoon and there was about a two hour gap between the timed ticket and the entry time, so we took this oppertunity to go and get something to eat.

I was advised to purchase souvenirs at the shop on top because items sold here are exclusive. Yes there are several other souvenir shops but merchandise differs.

Views from the top were spectacular (was lucky to get a clear sunny day), but you get similar views from either 350 or 450 - it's just that 450 is a little less crowded. Well worth visiting to give you a good idea of just how dense Tokyo living is, and also an idea of the geography of the whole city. Highly recommend but pick a clear day."

We got our ticket and took the lift up and were on the lower level viewing deck within 10 minutes of arriving.View is great as expected, and while it was busy, it was not too busy that you couldn't get a good view from a window after a short wait. If you are tight on cash, you could skip the higher viewing platform, as while the views are great and there are less people, I found the lower levels were just as good, and in some cases better if you are trying to take a photo. I also liked that they had a glass floor section on the lower levels where you could look straight down to the group below. Nice.All in all, an enjoyable trip up one of the worlds tallest towers."

There are two observatory decks. In the ground floor they give only ticket for first deck for 2000 JPY. It is quiet expensive too. If you want to go second observatory deck, you have to purchase the same from first observatory desk at a cost of another 1000 JPY. High speed elevator took me to first observatory deck. It is observation tower as well as Tokyo broadcasting station. I did not go the second deck. Because, for this purpose there will be another big queue to purchase the ticket. I feel you can find hardly any difference from second deck so far as the view is concerned. You can have breathtaking view of the Tokyo city. All skyscrapers, river, railway line are visible and it is marvelous.It is lovely. Without visiting Tokyo Skytree, your Tokyo visit is incomplete. The day I visited, the visibility was not so good; hence Mount Fuji was not visible from observatory deck. There is big shopping complex and food court at the bottom o the structure. In the third level Sumida Aquarium is worth to visit. I advise to book online ticket (Web booking) to visit this structure. This will save you lot of precious time."

When we went to Tokyo in September 12, Tokyo Sky Tree had just been opened to Public and from the Net, we came to know that in order to regulate huge rush of crowd , only advance on-line booking was permitted and no day ticket was being given.However, one weekday,after visiting Sensoji temple ,we came to Sky tree station which was only one stop from Asakusa station to sky tree station in Tobu line After reaching ground, we were stunned to see the imposing structure which was about to touch the sky!! On enquiry, I was pleasantly surprised to know that on the spot day tickets were available as rush of visitors had eased out to some extent.I also found that purchasing ticket was made very systematic!First, I stood in a Q behind about 10-15 persons at about 10 am where I was given a time ticket advising to be present in a particular counter from 11-30 am to 12 noon Again I stood in the designated Q behind about 10 persons and got the ticket for the first deck for 2000 Yen. A high speed elevator took us to first deck which had a sky tree cafe, asky tree restaurant and a sky tree shop. After spending some time moving arond the circular deck and appreciating TOKYO sky line, we purchased tickets for the 2nd deck for another 1000 Yen.Another lift took us to the 2nd deck which was 450 meter high whereas 1st deck was at a height of 350 meter. A breath taking view awaited us here and we could wee the whole of TOKYO through the glass lined beck However, Mount Fuji was not visible .After spending some time we came down with a memory worth cherishing albeit expensive.Tokyo Sky Tree happens to be the tallest tower in the World and 2nd tallest structure in the World only after Burz Khalifa.It serves as an observation tower as well as a transmission and broadcasting station."

We were one of the first to get into the lifts and go up and up and up. We had a spectacular view of the vastness of Tokyo, and as we had perfect weather (definitely go in winter when the air is crisp and clean), we could see for miles and miles. There were plenty of helpful signs and staff, letting you know what you were looking at and where everything was (i.e. glass for looking down, the loo's and cafe etc.). We spent nearly 3 and a half hours just wandering around and around, snapping away. Luckily enough, we didn't have to wait to enjoy a break in their skytree cafe. We expected to be kicked out after 30 minutes (as the sign hinted at) but, we nearly spent an hour relaxing and enjoying the view. The quality of cakes and hot drinks served were much better than expected and not near as dear as I thought it would ... should be. We even bought the skytree cup (reasonably priced at 800 yen) as our special souvenir, as you can't get it down below in any of the shops (only from the cafe).We made a mistake (misunderstanding the staff's directions) coming down from the very top observatory to the main observatory, before taking our photo ... we explained our mistake to the staff, and they were very accomodating allowing us to go back up again, to take the photo.It did start getting very, very crowded around 11 a.m. and when we came back down there was a very long line waiting ... so, definitely go early, if you hate crowds.We definitley want to go back in the early evening to see the night view, too ..."

Thus your only option is to go, pick up a time sheet (yes, only possible in person for the same day), come back at that very time (roughly 3 hours later!) and wait in line for at least another 30min (to actually purchase a very expensive ticket). Then you get to finally go through this attraction feeling like a herd of catle. View is ok but to be honest Tokyo Tower or any tall hotel in Shinjuku offers similar. There is soooo much to see in Tokyo, it's simply not worth it wasting time with this one."

I went to Tokyo Tower on my last trip years ago, and with the SkyTree now open it was a \"must see\" according to my Japanese friend who hadn't visited yet either but was dying to go, so we went. We went on a weekend which happened to be a holiday weekend (Coming of Age Day, \u6210\u4eba\u306e\u65e5, Seijin no Hi). We called ahead to check on tickets and they were already pre-sold out and only available in person, luckily another friend was able to go to SkyTree earlier in the day and get us 3 reservation slips to ensure we had tickets at our assigned time slot (8pm, last entrance of the day). That day they gave out the last tickets before 2pm so plan ahead on potentially busy days. Also, online ordering was restricted to Japan-issued credit cards only. We finally arrived at our assigned time, turned in our vouchers for tickets, and proceeded to the top. Elevator ride is pretty cool as it's very quick to get so high up and has some surprises for you. View was nice even on a cloudy evening after dark, really gives some perspective to just how massive Tokyo is. Lots of things to see around the decks though, typical tourist things like a cafe and photo opportunities. We paid the extra to go up one more level to the highest possible point. The view doesn't change much but hey, why not, right? A little less crowded upstairs too. Being that we were part of the final timeslot of the day the crowd was manageable. One disappointment was upon leaving everything else (gift shops, restaurants) in the SkyTree complex was already closed. We ended up heading to the Asahi bar around the corner and strolling along the river which was probably a better end to an exhausting day anyways :)."

It's all completely unnecessary if you just plan in advance to avoid the crowds. The Sky Tree opens at 8am. We went at 9am and walked right in. No lines at all. We were told that in late morning and afternoons that the wait time can exceed several hours. The Sky Tree offers completely different experiences during day or night visits, so we went back again in the evening to take in the gorgeous night views (and the tower itself is a breathtaking sight at night too, all lit up in gorgeous turquoise blue). In this case, go late. Don't compete with the dinner/date crowds in the early evening when again the wait time can be hours long. Go an hour or two before closing and simply walk right in. We had no lines and no crowds during both of our visits to the Sky Tree, so this is something easily avoided.The only thing we felt was a little \"off\" was how cleverly they get you to pay twice if you want to go all the way to the top. The initial 2,000 yen ticket only gets you to the first/biggest bauble. If you want to go the highest one, it's another elevator (and another 1,000 yen) from there.Wind also needs to be taken into account. The elevators can't operate in moderate to high winds, so if you're on your way to the Sky Tree and you can see the trees moving briskly in the breeze, don't bother. Come back again later when the wind has died down."

There is no need to walk far to satisfy cravings for Tempura, curry, ramen and other Japanese dishes. Omiyage shopping can be done here, too.

I opted for the latter. the draw back to pre-purchase is if you get an unclear day you're stuck. Once you get there show them your ticket and they will guide you to the entrance. Once you get to the top (almost to the top) you look around, buy ice cream, drink coffee, etc. You enjoy a panoramic view of Tokyo. I've been told that on a clear day you can see Mt. Fuji. A glass for to step on and view straight down if you have the stomach for it is available. For an additional fee you can go up higher to the summit (100 meters higher). I did it the first time and was nice but not much more to see or do. All in all it was fun to see and do. you can make a half day out of the place.

I didn't know about getting online reservations, but it turns out that can only be done with credit cards issued in Japan. If you know someone who has one of those, force them to help you out. Advance tickets can also be gotten through some travel agents, says the web site, so I'll look into that for the next time. I note on their website that they are not selling tickets \"at the door\" during school holidays (22. May- 10. July), so try the travel agent route if that's when you are traveling to Tokyo.Here's the website. http://www.tokyo-skytree.jp/en/reservation/We were told waiting time was abut one hour, but it was nearly two before we got to the counter to buy tickets. From then on fairly smooth process. Elevator ride to the top was incredibly fast and smooth, with minimal ear-popping. But at 350 meters one could barely see across the Sumidagawa, let alone the vast expanse of Tokyo, and of course Mt Fuji was just a dream. Ticket to the higher level is purchased at 350 meters, so if you see a break in the crowd, jump in line. It was worth the extra 1000 yen, if only for the mural of Tokyo, done by a foreigner with a great sense of humour in traditional Japanese style.Food available at the top was minimal, just a coffee shop, as the more formal Japanese restaurant was fully booked already. The mall around the lower six or seven floors had some nice shops in it, but was totally jammed, and we were there on a Wednesday, with school still in session. Unless it's your only chance, I'd give it a year or two for the crowds to die down."

            "review": "Arguably the best view of Tokyo you can get plus more!. If you think the Tokyo Sky Tree is just a tower you go up to see views, you are wrong! It is situated in a small sort of shopping mall but as I am not much of a shopper I went for 2 things, the aquarium and the Sky Tree. To get there, I walked from Asakusa because I was alone and don't mind walking, but there is a train that does take you there (which I used to get back to my hotel). The aquarium was rather spectacular considering the size of space given, but used the number of floors to their advantage. The biggest attraction was the live penguin show they have, were they feed the penguins calling out their names and watching them dash in the water to get the fish. Also the displays they had where you could see the researchers doing research and their experiments, mainly the jellyfish. The SkyTree is more expensive than the Tokyo Tower but for a reason, you can go higher. I somehow got lucky and got some amazing shots of the sun breaking through the clouds as it was a little late, but not late enough to see the sunset. It was very crowded, I judged it by how easy it was to get a photo of the glass floor area and it was pretty easy. I couldn't go to the second level as I didn't have enough cash to get home (was very sad about that) but I hear that is is even more amazing, and would have probably waited up there for the sunset. If you only want to go up 1 tower in Tokyo, I'd say the Sky Tree is your best option because of it's height and that it is in a small shopping mall, which is helpful for having a lot of things close together and saving on travel."

Also, the shopping mall is great with a lots of shopping!! Also, you've got to buy the Tokyo Banana Tree!! BUY THEM ALLL! I actually went back there for a second time to buy more to bring back home. Very yummy!!I walked from Asakusa towards Sky Tree. Took me about 30 minutes by foot. Lovely walk and I got to enjoy the wonderful streets of Tokyo. I think it is a good idea to talk a stroll around the area. It isn't as busy as Shibuya etc; but it's nice enough to deserve some of our precious time.Souvenirs sold at the lobby area are quite pricey though. But other than that; way to go, Sky Tree!"

You can enjoy an excellent view of Tokyo and its vicinity, all you can expect to see when you are 350m to 450m above from ground level.Apart from the tower, the facilities nearby are very amazing. Wide varieties of shops and restaurants are located and you will definitely need at least a whole day to explore it!Furthermore, as the tower is located in the district of Sumida, which has not been the most popular spots as Ginza, Shibuya and Shinjuku, you can take your time to stroll around to explore the authentic Japanese streets in the vicinity of Tokyo Sky Tree. Museums and old-styled Japanese groceries, gift stores, cafe and restaurants are places to visit and they have very good tour guides which you can obtain from tourist information center.If you know a friend who lives in Tokyo, you may even ask him/her to get a ticket for you online which may save you some time in queuing for the admission tickets OR you may even stay in a hotel nearby which provides accommodation and Tokyo Sky Tree admission ticket package."

Tokyo has an amazing skyline you must see it from one tower or the other.The Sky tree is pretty new (2012) so it is very popular also among local travelers.When I got there (11am on a Wednesday) tickets were available for 14pm only and I didn't have the time to wait or to go back. So be aware of this !!!I would recommend going first to skytree see the queue. If you have too long wait hours (2+) you can go and visit Asakusa and the Sensoji tempe, the Nakamise shopping street and then come back. there is also a fancy shopping mall and plenty of restaurants around so another option is to plan your shopping / launch / dinner for your wait period.Best of luck with your visit!Even if you don;t go up it is worth visiting the site, as it is amazing to stand next to the tower ... I've been \"up\" in other buildings (office in Roppongi Mori tower, hotel room in Shinjuku) so I didn't mind the view that much :)"

We only went as far as the first level - but that was more than enough. Booking and entrance was very well-managed. When you arrive on site head for the first queue you see - which will give you a time slot for your actual entrance. You hold onto this ticket until your half-hour time slot and then join the main queue at the appropriate juncture.In the meantime you can catch some food or shopping at the mall below the Sky Tree.You move forward pretty rapidly to the ticket desk and buy your ticket for the 350m level. This is all handled with the utmost efficiency. At the 350m level there is a 360 degree viewing gallery. We arrived half an hour before sunset and stayed until half an hour after sunset, thus picking up the best of the views by day and night. I would recommend that you plan your visit to do the same. After all, if you've flown 10k miles to be in Japan it would be a shame not to maximise the effect.If you want to go to the 450m level there is an additional payment - payable as you go from the 350m gallery - but, to be honest, unless you are a numbers junkie, I'm not sure what advantage you would get from the view at that higher level. In fact you might have more difficulty in focusing on the ground. By the way - using a smart phone camera as your main tool is more or less a waste of time. Bring your best digital camera."

It's expensive (2000Yen to Tembo & frm 1st deck another 1000Yen to 2nd deck), compare to the free TMG, not to mention the long queue even on weekday, one have to get a numbered ticket for the time slot then upon time slot have to queue again for the ticket purchase (which i totally feel its a stupid system, they shud hav let u buy the ticket while waitin for entrance timing instead of reach entrance timing then queue for ticket), thn hav to queue & squeeze for the lift thn only reach the ultimate destination. I do not want to pre-book the ticket scaring the weathr might b awful since the adm is so expensive. The 1st deck wide window allows better view, 2nd deck thou higher but have more bars in btw so difficult for pics but will have wider window near end of the route. I recommend goin in the late evenin to see the sunset & wait for the nite view, also make sure to check weather. Also note that there're gaps btw window & safety bar so be careful of ur mobile phone & cameras whn takin pics, i've seen 2 ppl drop their mobile into the gap during my visit & required the staff to retrieve. This is recommended for visit If u hav time & budget & don wanna miss the latest landmark of Tokyo, else TMG and Tokyo Tower will be better option"

Although it is 500 Yen more expensive for a date & time reserved ticket than the simple one (date reserved), it was still worth for us visitors.We were lucky that after one year's service, there were not so crowded than we expected--although we went there on Chinese New Year vacation! Of course, the reserved ticket also did a good help for us. The night view was stunning (we entered around 17:30), Tokyo City seemed to expend until the horizon, which is the largest metro I have ever seen. There were some shops (cafe, souvenir, photo taking...etc) on the top. Photo service is 1200 yen once (buy or not) and they also take one photo with your camera.It was a good experience, and the shopping mall \"Soramachi\" was also fun.Worth a visit!p.s. we went Asakusa Temple first in the morning and then walk to Sky Tree. Soramachi was our time-killer in the afternoon. If you finish visiting Sky Tree in afternoon, you can also try taking a cruise to Odaiba for night life! The Tokyo Cruise station is right close to Tobu Asakusa Station (3 min's walk from subway Asakusa Station)!"

Lineup lasted for about an hour, and the basic cost to the 3500m level is 2000 yen. You can book online 3 days beforehand, but last time I checked everything is done in Japanese only. Whatever, I loved the view so much, such that I returned 2 days later (and went through that 45 minutes line up again) just to admire Tokyo's one-of-a-kind night skyline. Once you are up on the \"basic\" 3500m level, you can choose to go further up to the 4500m level for an extra 1000 yen, and along with that another 15 minutes wait in line. While I did pay that extra 1000 yen and went right to the top (4500m above ground), I would not recommend that \"bonus\" level: the view from there isn't really any much better than the one you get at 3500m, and the annoying coloured lights shining on the sides of the walkway actually became an annoying source of visual obstruction. Transportation to the Sky Tree Tower is quite easy for the most part: get off at Tokyo Skytree Station along the Tobu Subway line (from Asakusa Station) or Oshiage Station along the Toei Asakusa Subway Line, make sure you study that subway map before moving an inch away from your hotel room though! If you visit during weekends / holidays, you may be issued a ticket with a specified time of visit when you first arrive. So do keep that in mind, and it might be a smart idea to \"check-in\" at the tower and grab that ticket first, then go for dinner and take a walk, and then visit the tower about 2 hours after the ticket is issued. If you have to choose between going during daytime or night time, I would recommend the night view over the daytime view.......if you can afford the time and money to do both, that's the best in my opinion!"

Anyway, we decided to walk around the shopping section of the tower since we were already there...big mistake! All the floors were ridiculously crowded and you could barely move. We literally spent 15 minutes there and left. Even had I gone on a less congested day, I don't think I would've found it to be \"all that.\" But, yes, the structure is impressively tall. If you're into tall towers, you will definitely appreciate it. It just wasn't for me and my family.So my advice would be 1) Avoid weekends if you're planning to go or wait another year for people get over the novelty of it. 2) Make reservations if you want to go to the observation deck. 3) If going from Ueno, opt to take the subway rather than a bus. Even if this requires you to switch trains at Asakusa, it's likely to be quicker."

The waiting ticket allows you to buy a ticket within a 30min time limit. I you miss it, you need a new waiting ticket. At all: Gettting into the tower is very time-consuming.

Two main floors are accessible with an extra cost for the second one (you pay it once arrive in the first floor).Few tips: go there at night 1 hour before it closes (i spent 30 sec in the line..) - i wouldn't recommend specially the second floor as it doesn't really offer more than the first one (no restaurant, no additionnal explanations, ...) + it's harder to take \"good\" picture at night from there since you cannot put directly the lens of your dslr camera on the front glass cause the gap between the handrail and the window is too large (tripod are forbidden as in all kind of those places).The view is really awesome when sky's clear Sky tree is very easily accessble from Asakusa."

            "review": "Things to do in Tokyo for weekend. 1/ Tokyo Skytree - get the Subway 'A Line' to A20 at about 13:00, then get a ticket which will allow you to start queuing for a ticket to go up at about 16:00 (a ticket to get a ticket!). This is ok though as the Tokyo Subway system is awesome, really easy for foreigner to use, cheap, fast, and very extensive city coverage, so, once you have the Skytree ticket to allow you to come back for a ticket, get back on the Subway & go to Ueno Park & Zoo at Subway G16 (10 minutes Subway away) to see the park & go into the Zoo (about US$5) which has Giant Panda's. When you head back to the Skytree for 16:00, be prepared to queue for maybe an hour with the other hundreds of people, but stick it out & get to the top of the Skytree, where you'll see (along the crowds of other people in there) the best view of Tokyo there is, including Mount Fuji if it's a clear day.2/ Ueno Park & Zoo - see above.3/ Yoyogi Park - F15 on the Subway. Before you go, buy a small bag of Sunflower Seeds from any seveneleven and go into the small gardens within the park (for maybe US$3) and feed the small birds which will land on your hand. See the Costumed people here too ('Cos-Play') in the Summer.4/ Tokyo Shinjuku Gyoen Park - F13 on the Subway. An absolutely stunning Park that'll make you amazed that you're in a huge city like Tokyo when you're stood in almost deserted silence in what seems the wild countryside woodland & grassed field areas.5/ Nights out in Kabukichu & Roppogni - not so bad places if you choose normal bars with no cover charge. The Nigerian touts are relentless & will annoy you after not too long but if you want a bar with working girls it'll cost you at least 2000 Yen to even get in and then the prices you pay after that may depend on if you've brokered a good deal with these Nigerian guys before you go in, but be careful. Roppogni is the better of the two places. Motown 1 bar in Roppogni was small but 'bouncing' with happy loud dancing people & 80's/90's/00's classic music.6/ Ginza Shopping Street - G9 on the Subway. Get there before 20:00 as that's when the shops close, but if you can time it to be after dark (but before 20:00) then you'll be very impressed with the bright lights. A very clean and impressive street. Also try New York basement bar here, the Beercan Chicken is superb.AVOID: Park Hyatt Hotel, it's a good view from the bar windows but to even order a drink it costs an initial US$20. Also it's not near a Subway, which is rare in Tokyo with so many Subways & Stations. Overrated just like the film the Bill Murray film that it trades its name on.BE WARNED: If you fly from or to Narita Airport allow 2 hours to/from Tokyo (not including check in time). Also - do not fear the Subway, so easy, so clean, so safe, so quiet, so cheap - DO NOT get a taxi from either Narita (26,000 yen) OR Haneda (8000 Yen) Airports into Tokyo, very expensive!"

Despite what the previous reviews say about having to queue up long, mine was a relatively short breeze to the ticket counter (I went there in November). The queue after purchasing the ticket wasn't that long either - it was just a security clearance check followed by a wait at the lobby for a very big lift to come down and fetch you up.The view of the city from the first deck was splendid and I could zoom in to see cars and people even though my camera wasn't that sharp or powerful. The tower itself was very new (since it just opened recently) and the service provided was really good, something that you'd more often than not expect from the Japanese people. Once in a while two window cleaners would descend from OUTSIDE the building (in an enclosed platform hung by tension cables of course) - it must take a lot of real guts to perform such a job - and they were still ever so pleasant to pose cheerfully for us to take pictures! In fact what made this structure stand out wasn't only its own unique features but the attitude of its staff as well.One tip to save your cash - buy tickets to the first observation deck only (Tembo deck). The second one (Galleria deck) which is located higher above costs an extra thousand yen and I didn't manage to see any difference in the view of the city. There are other features marketed on the brochure to entice you to go (like a room filled with lights) - they are heavily exaggerated and aren't anything special once you see them."

Seeing up close the latticework of pipes that forms the Sky Tree is impressive - and it really does have something of an organic feel to it. However, money aside, the queue waiting to go up to the top is enough to put you off. I recommend just strolling through the massive shopping mall - Sky Tree Town - of which the Sky Tree is a part. It is h-u-g-e, with high-end shop after high-end shop for as long as you can keep walking. In that sense it's a slice of Shinjuku or Shibuya forming an island of glitz in Tokyo's grotty east end. Because, look across the road and you'll see that the drab, suburban landscape that existed here before the Sky Tree maintains its drabness - meaning there is absolutely nothing to do here besides see the Sky Tree and walk through its seeming endless shopping mall. Nevertheless it's a great one-off buzz, especially while it's still new."

I love the design of the Sky Tree with a concrete central column and a steel exoskeleton. It is very easy to get to- go to the Oshige metro stop, and it is a nice ten minutes walk away. We deliberately chose to go early on a weekday AM in Dec to avoid the crowds. At 930 AM it was a beautiful sunny day and only a 15 minutes wait to get admitted. The Japanese workers do a well organized job to get the lines moving quickly. The cost is 2000 yen or $25 to get to the 350 m level, and then another 1000 yen for the 450 m level. We did both levels but felt going to the first level was probably enough money spent. Afterwards I recommend everyone considering visiting the amazing nearby Senso ji shrine in Asakusa."

It is a motley collection of shops, perhaps appealing only to the younger crowd -- think Shibuya (but Shibuya is better organised). You would do better to visit any of the shopping complexes at Ikebukuru or Shinjuku. The range of goods there is much wider.Many people visit because of the tower, reputedly the tallest in the world. But if you must visit, you need a lot of time. The ticket purchase is fast, with much less crowd than when it first opened, but I noticed that the line to ride the elvator is at least one to two hours long. And as with most cities, the view up there is nothing to crow about.There is also a (rather small) aquarium and planetarium.There are many restaurants in the complex but be prepared for long lines, especially at lunch time on a weekend. Most of these are branches of brand-name restaurants, serving the same food (with the same high prices).My opinion is that you should consider visiting only if(a) you have planty of time on hand (and don't know what to do);(b) you have no idea what to do in Tokyo; and/or(c) you are the young crowd (late teens and early twenties)."

You have a choice of the Tower, the shopping mall with lots of original handmade Japanese crafts, the aquarium (more for little kids) or just walking around the immediate area and admiring the tower. I highly recommend going to the tourist center outside the tower to get English info on places to see, restaurants, etc. in the area, and also recommend the Foodie Floor on the 2nd floor (great place to get an excellent variety of food and eat outside). The best way to visit would be to take the subway to Asakusa, take a rickshaw to the tower, and then walk back to the station."

It is a rush, built super modern and I did not feel unsafe at any point, despite the crazy heights. Simply the best view anywhere. The trick is to get in, on a clear day the place is totally packed with people. I went on a semi clear day in which the lower observation deck was great, but the upper was in the clouds -- even then, incredible experience -- and because of that, we had literally no lines to get it. This is a must on a trip to Tokyo! Leaves you with awesome photos and video, for all the friends who were not able to travel with you to Tokyo."

There was a line but we got our tickets by 8:10am and went straight up to the observation deck. By the time we came down at 9-9:30, the line was very long and they were distributing a ticket to come back to quere again at 10:30. So you should definitely be there before 8am.The view from the lower deck was good, but because the tower is located at the edge of Tokyo the view itself is not very interesting. The view from the higher deck was not that different from the lower deck, and it was somewhat obstructed because of the windows panes. So in my opinion save $1000 and just visit the lower deck.We went to Ropping Hills in the afternoon and the view from there was much more interesting as it's located in the center of Tokyo. Besides there was no line at all. So I would suggest skipping Sky Tree altogether and go to Roppongi Hills."

We arrived around 4pm with clueless vision of how to go to the top. Been trying ways to buy tickets online but not available. Arrived there only to find flocks of people in groups of tremendous quantity. Don't have clear info how to buy tickets or whatsoever.Fortunately a security guard forward us to 4th floor using lift. Up and we found long lines of people queuing for something we don't have clear idea what it is. Is it to buy tickets or to wait for elevator or what? Still clueless. Asking to information ladies only to be asked back, DO YOU HAVE RESERVATION? Of course we don't. Okay, so you will only be able to buy tickets for 7.30 pm. But where should I buy the tickets? You got to have the numbers. She said without smiling, probably tiring answering the same question all day long. So I'm still clueless up to this point even after asking direction from information ladies. Okay, now we decided we just happy to take picture of this tower from below. So we went outside bracing the very cold icy winds to terrace. Upon walking around to get better pics of this new tower I then stumble into new different lines of people queuing in an open tent with several officer shouting things in Japanese while waving some cards. Chaotic. Still lost in translation.I move closer to have a clear picture of what they are doing and what they are queuing for. Apparently THIS IS THE NUMBER things that the information ladies informed. Those officer are waving cards with 7.30 pm written on it. Quickly I gather all our entourage to queue since one person only can have one card. After a while then we have the queuing number which enable us to QUEUE AGAIN to buy tickets at the designated time written in our card. What a confusing system.Since we have like 2-1,5 hours to kill we decided to have dinner. 15 minutes before 7.30 pm we back in different queuing lines than the taking number line. Moving slowly in line finally we approached ticketing counters to buy ticket of JPY 2,000 and ushered to another queuing line to take elevators to top. Finally around 8.30 pm we arrived in 350 meters viewing platform. Wants to go up to 450 meters platform? Please queue again this way to buy another JPY 1,000 ticket. OMG not another queue.So how is the view? MAGNIFICENT. They manage to build a better version of Mori Tower. Slanted the glass outward so no images reflected, only pitch black of gleaming lights of Tokyo night. SPLENDID !!! Will I go here again? No. Not with that kind of queuing system and thousand of people eager to go up. Perhaps later."

The tricky part comes when you wanna take pictures of the city with and without the sun.

Due to the overwelming number of tourist, once the queue to purchase the admission ticket gets too long, they start to issue out limited \"Queue Tickets\" that has a certain time slot for you to come back to purchase the admission ticket. Also, you can't ask for a queue ticket with a specific time slot. They just issue in order and change to later time slot when the current one runs out. Here is the breakdown of my schedule (its a saturday so gauge for yourself):1200hrs: Get queue ticket for time slot 1500 ~ 1530 (admission 1530 ~1600)1510hrs: Joins the queue for purchase1530hrs: Purchased ticket for Tembo Deck (350m)1540hrs: Enters Lift for Tembo Deck1542hrs: Reaches Tembo Deck and joins queue for Tembo Galleria1552hrs: Purchased ticket for Tembo Galleria (450m)1555hrs: Enters lift for Tembo GalleriaEnjoy......Imho, it would be perfect to reach Tembo Galleria between 1645 ~ 1700 as you'll have some time to enjoy the sunset and wait for another half an hour to snap that camera after dark.

If you like heights then there is no reason to wait.In the elevator ride up or down try to get to the back of the elevator and look up. The light the inside of the tower for the journey. The doorway at the halfway point also sees outside but through the metal structure."

Like most towers you have to pay an additional fee to go right to the top but we didn't bother. The view is no better than that at Tokyo Tower, which is much cheaper and has entertainment. I wouldn't go here again but I am glad I can say I have been. There are many shops and restaurants below the tower which are worth a look. Overall I was very disappointed with it."

Didnt expext much, and had no plans of getting up since it was too expensive and the lines do get long.But, it is prettier than I expected! I suggest you to go there in the evening, and to get off not at the skytree station but from a station where you will need to walk around 10 min to it. Why? Because it looks very nice from a distance where you're not too close. You get to see the beautiful lights, and the elevator from outside looks like falling stars. And the tower glows!Stations include kinshichou on sobu line, and maybe asakusa as well? I walked from kinshichou to Skytree. It was a pretty 20 min walk. There are maps in the station, it's generally one of the suggested stations to go to Sky tree. Easy to ask! Japanese will help you.And then there is Solamachi right under the tower. It is a huge shopping mall! 8 floors was it? It has all of the things you need for your Japanese souvenirs. Asakusa might be cheaper but you find the same stuff there. In solamachi 4th floor (or was it second?) you have all the decent quality Japanese souvenirs, key chains, shirts, kimono, calligraphy pen, uniqlo, loft, etc. Sometimes I find it hard shopping for gifts to bring home in Takashimaya or other department stores, but here, it's really good. Restaurants fill many floors.Compared to Tokyo Tower: sky tree is twice higher! From afar sky tree does not look pretty day or night, but from a kilometer way at night, it's worth seeing. I went up Tokyo tower, the view is nice if you like tall places and night views. For those saving money: go to the Shinjuku Metropolitan Building or Tochou in Japanese. It is always suggested as a free alternative to the paid towers. :) enjoy the night view!"

Instead, we spent some time wandering among the sprawl of shops and restaurants below. In hindsight, I was a bit disappointed not to be able to have gone up and really should've bought tickets prior to going (though apparently it's only available to those with a Japanese credit card).

Even telcos butchers lets you do that... Anyway you queue for your tickets, then queue for security, then queue for the lift, then queue to get out of the lift, the queue to get a peek out of the window, then queue for the loo which you're desperate for because you last saw one 4h ago, then queue for the cafe, then queue for the stairs/escalator to get downstairs, then queue for over-priced photos, then queue to go into the souvenir shop, then queue to look at the glass floor, then queue for tickets to the next deck, then queue for the lift to the next deck, then queue for the lift down. Honestly, the whole thing was completely in-enjoyable and shambolic - which is unusual for Japan.Can't dissuade you enough... Went to world trade centre for a fiver and it was completely empty.

After the 3/11 Tohoku earthquake it's also an inspirational piece of architecture that confirms Japan's ability to rebound from anything. It was started well before the earthquake but I think it's something to be proud of as an example of how resilient the building in Tokyo are. Now it's not perfect. It does take a while to get to the top. Long lines and all that. Just go expecting them and you will be fine. It's not cheap either so budget for it. I had someone reserve tickets through a tour guide for us before it officially opened but the lines were still there. The restaurant at the top was nice but they do make you wait in lines when seats are open which makes me wonder why that would happen. What are they waiting for? It's a tourist attraction so expect the shops and the various trinkets all over that you can buy. You are there to go to the highest manmade place in Japan. Look out the windows and take photos. Stop and fell the tower sway. The shopping in the building next to the tower is okay. Expensive in my view but I'm more for cheap things. I will say that the spotted banana shaped sponge cakes with banana cream filling are pretty good. I'd prefer to buy a couple on a pate for less than the expensive wrapped ones so I can just eat them with a good cup of coffee but that's not an option. The staff are all very polite and always willing to help. You'll find most of Tokyo to be this way but being in the newest attraction probably makes the work load double and the employees are doing a great job of handling the extra load.To much writing I know but go and experience it and then you can say you have been in the tallest communications tower in the World. Don't forget to visit the other tower and the Tokyo Gov't building but aren't in the Guinness Book for anything."

You can see the Tokyo Tower from top. It's definitely worth going after a visit to the Asakusa Temple if have time. The shopping mall should not be missed. We got most of our snacks souvenir there since they have a wide selection. Restaurants there are great, too! We tried a few. Most of the stuff is \"Sky Tree\" special - so don't miss them.

It was a fine day when we visited and no doubt the luck of the weather will play a role in any visits as the fine weather we had meant that we could see vast distances very clearly.The whole operation of the Sky Tree was very slick, with the uniformed staff (the uniforms themselves are a unique fashion statement!) very friendly and also very efficient in moving the crowds through. It was crowded when we visited, but that's Tokyo really, and obviously the locals are extremely proud of their new landmark. The lifts up and down were amazingly quick and smooth with quite a few operating the day we visited to keep the queues moving.There are a number of great photo opportunities including the glass floor that you can stand on and also have your group photos taken by the operators at a reasonable cost (1200 yen I think it was for a printed photo) and they will also take a shot for you with your own camera.If in Tokyo go and have a look at the Sky Tree and if you can, go up to the viewing area.

But they send send the up elevators down empty. They make you stand in line for two hours so you can descend 10 meters to the down elevators. Why can't we go down on the same elevator I came up on? Is it too windy? If the elevators are too fragile to handle the breeze following last night's typhoon, how is the structure handling the tons of human flesh and Canon cameras pouring onto the observation deck?

There's not much you can do here except look at it. Soon you'll be able to take a very expensive ride up to the observation deck."

There are 2 versions, blue and purple) Couldn't get in as they were not open during my recent trip to Tokyo. I heard there is going to be a restaurant, but booking is already full for months ahead."

As Tokyo Sky Tree just opened in early 2012, it is the Tokyo flavour of the month, and will be overwhelmed with visitors at least through the summer of 2012. If you have the option of waiting a bit longer, after the newness has worn off, you will have a much more pleasant time."

It's going to carry HD and cell traffic as well as being a tourist site and place to look down on the city. Nearby is the Sosenji Shrine with its rows of tourist shops and gorgeous grounds. Visit the old and new at the same time. Also a good jumping off point for a cruise of the Sumida River."

I'm not always impressed with the modern architecture of Japan but they really hit the mark with this magnificent creation! It hovers over Tokyo like giant Hattori Hanz\u014d Sword and I can't wait to be standing on the top observatory AND the one below for that matter and view the beautiful sprawl of the world's greatest city!"

Having recently returned from a trip to Japan, I was overwhelmed by people's opinions about the Sky Tree.It seems most people seem to be rather negative about it - But I have to say considering everything that the country has been through recently, I think it just goes to prove the resolute and determined nature of the people that they are continuing to build such a beautiful piece of architecture.I was lucky enough to stay in a building with a phenominal view looking out onto the Sky Tree and even though it is still not finished, it somehow completes the Tokyo skyline.I would say to anyone who is thinking or toying with the idea of travelling to Japan - DO IT.Do not hesitate. The people are so kind and generous and the country itself is beautiful.And contrary to many people's comments, We found most meals etc between 1000-2000 Yen (which at the time equated to around \u00a310-20) We were very lucky to be able to do our entire trip without the need of staying in hotels which does greatly help with the cost, however if you don't mind staying outside the centre of Tokyo, I can very much recommend a beautiful, smaller city called Kashiwa in Chiba prefecture. Its only about 45 minutes by train (JR Joban line) into Tokyo. We were SO incredibly lucky that while we were there Kashiwa was holding its annual 2-day festival...well worth the humid weather!"
