Apart of typical peruwian animals like alpacas, wikunias, CONDORS, you can see black bear cub, hairless dog, 2 pumas, felis (predator cat), and many many other. Animals are being rescued from smugglers or found close by their dead parents. They also have first in Peru condor breeding program which is really interesting taking under consideration that condors have one partner for whole their life. All breed condors are being relisted back to nature in Machu Pichcu area. unfortunately such a big cause is not donated by government so they accept all donations. All products from their shop are from alpacas which lives in sanctuary. Good lesson for whole family, great place to visit.."

This place is a commercial enterprise pretending to be a \"non profit sanctuary for animals\" while using the poor animals simply to make money. The animals ARE NOT released to freedom, don't believe any of the stories they tell you. This is pure exploitation of the animals and poor treatment of these poor animals for commercial purposes alone. DO NOT SPEND YOUR TIME AND MONEY in this place.

The girl giving us a tour spoke in both Spanish and English and gave us lots of information about all the animals. I admire the work they do here and the staff seemed caring and passionate (they're all volunteers). A wide variety of animals. Obviously it would be better if they were in the wild but unfortunately that's not possible with some of them. For example the pumas had had their claws removed for performing in a nightclub so they'd be unable to survive in the wild. The work they're doing to release condors is excellent considering they have no government support. I found this tour more interesting than any of the ruins I saw that day and the next."

I\u2019m animal lover and an activist myself, so this visit was kind of a \u2018must do\u2019.They are doing a great job out there. The place itself is not big, but animals are kept in good conditions, are well fed and looked after. They are working on new enclosures too, for example: for the spectacled bear they look after. I had a feeling that people working there are really keen and caring. It was a great opportunity for me to see some of the Peruvian animals, I wouldn\u2019t have seen otherwise. OK, I\u2019d rather see them living free, but also rather see them living safe lives in the sanctuary, than in bad hands. All the animals in there are rescued. People who work there told me many of their stories, some really sad indeed. They have quite a lot of species living there: lamas, alpacas, vicunas, parrots, tortoises (which I saw eating their lunch :) ), Andean foxes (stunning), pumas (truly amazing). And even a funny looking Peruvian hairless dogs. The sanctuary\u2019s work on re-introducing the condor population in Andes is fantastic. It takes a lot of effort to breed those magnificent birds, and they are doing this out there. Some of the birds I\u2019ve seen will be released soon. Once you\u2019re there, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to see condors flying. The experience is just fantastic.I have booked my travel to the sanctuary via an agent, but left a donation too, as I\u2019m not sure how much of my fee would actually go to the sanctuary. So, if you go there, please dig deep, as this is what keeps them going."

Then he told us about this place, and we were game to go. A member of the staff gave us a tour and explained the many animals they are caring for. In addition to walking among threatened condors (that are being bred in captivity for release into the wild), we saw vicuna, giant rabbits, tortoises, \"domesticated\" pumas (so doomed to living a life behind bars), Peruvian hairless dogs, and several species of parrots that had been injured or clipped and could not survive in the wild. The admission fee was only about $3.50 and worth every penny. After learning about the amazing conservation work the staff is doing, we made additional donations. We arrived just before closing time, so we could only gaze at the lovely gift shop and snack bar through the windows."

Met Albert, my tour guide, at the beginning of the sanctuary and I was surprised there was no entry fee. He showed me around and told me how all the animals came to be there and their plans for them. Beautiful llamas and alpacas and they even have a little bear cub running around like a puppy. Se llama Moses. The condor exhibit was pretty cool, too. There's about a half dozen and they sometimes fly from one end to the other. Impressive to witness. At the end, they ask for a donation. I gave 10 soles and received a free gift. I also spent a little in their gift shop, which also goes toward their cause.Enjoy!"

And because I have been wanting to see a spectacled bear ever since hearing David Attenborough narrate a documentary on the cutest mother-cub story, I dragged my boyfriend here. We saw lots other than Moises the cute but kinda shy and mischievous bear. There was a broken-beaked toucan, lots of vicunas and llamas and alpacas, and the guides will tell you the differences between all of them. Vicunas are the most expensive ones. But security is pretty tight here so you wouldn't be able to shave or smuggle or kidnap anything from here. There's also a couple of big cats, and even a condor flight show. Lots of different types of monkeys and birds. Best part is that visitors help support an awesome cause. Take a bus here from Cusco and haggle the price down (most operators know this place by its name so it should be easy to find, and it's located right by the main road), it should cost a little less than going to Pisac."

The staff here clearly love the animals and do their very best to look after them. Yes, the animals are in enclosures but often they cannot be released (eye damage, claws removed by cruel owners etc). You will see Andean Condors swoop to collect their food, pat Alpacas and come close to wild Cats and bears. It's an easy way to see a stack of animals that you probably won't come across in the jungle. Plus, you are supporting one of the few NFP services that help some of these highly endangered species. The tour is technically free but you should give a sizable donation to support this worthy cause (we gave 100 Sols each). "

The Andean condors and pumas were particularly compelling -- and their stories heart-rending. However, we were dismayed to see the baby spectacled bear in a tiny concrete enclosure where he was exhibiting neurotic behavior due to his cramped quarters -- he was frantically pacing back and forth ---and the same goes for another animal in a dark box in the middle of the sanctuary -- maybe a coatimundi? It was hard to see what it was. Overall we admired the work of this place but felt strongly that a few of the rescued animals needs were clearly not being met due to insufficiently sized and barren enclosures, and this greatly concerned us."

We hired a taxi to drive us up to this sanctuary (about a 1/2 hour from Cusco), wait for us, then drop us at Sacsayhuaman. It was a wonderful morning. The guide at the sanctuary was great and spoke English. We loved seeing the bear, llama, vicunas, alpacas, wild cat, puma, exotic birds, snakes, and of course condors. We spent about an hour there. Also, I'm not a shopper but I bought a beautiful scarf from their shop and wish I had bought more for family and friends. The quality and value seemed better than anything else I encountered the rest of the trip."

Ccochahuasi Animal Sanctuary is about 30 minutes outside of Cusco by private transfer - we opted to have the Sanctuary pick us up in the main square, and were efficiently transferred to and from the Sanctuary. A collection of animals including llamas, alpacas, vicunas, condors, small cats, spectacled bear, and birds are available for viewing. Individuals guides appear to be assigned to visitors as they arrive. The guided walk through the small sanctuary took about an hour, although they're quick to move you through the experience. A nice opportunity to learn about their rescue and breeding efforts in the local area - hopefully they will be able to expand their facility in the near future."

We weren't given an opportunity to feed or touch the llamas and alpacas, as other reviewers talked about. We were given brief 1 sentence explanations, and were rushed to the next animal, and then practically shoved out the door. I'm going to guess they were about to close when we got there, and if they had said something, we would have come back the following day to get the true experience, instead of this mess we got, making us believe they were more interested in taking our money over anything else.

You can even go into the condor enclosure and see those beasts up close, I have to say they're absolutely terrifying. You can also see how they make alpaca textiles and use all natural dyes from plants.

First time I have ever pet a condor, llama, or alpaca in my life. They house a few of the animals sacred to Peruvian ancestral culture (Condor, Puma) as well as animals that have been an important part of Peruvian culture (Llama, hawks, wild cats, guinea pigs, etc). These animals earn their keep. The condor is something like 50 yrs old and has been putting on flight shows for the reserve for years now. What a privilege it was to stand next to and pet that Elder. A real treat seeing all of the animals, hanging out with them, and learning a bit more about them. Truly unique experience.

In addition the sanctuary has monkeys and tortoises.Several species of birds can be view - some caged, some not. The Andean condors are not caged.

However, while touring the Sacred Valley with our private guide, she kindly agreed to take us there early since it was on the way to a town. I was ecstatic! At the entrance, we met with a sanctuary guide who was so helpful and informative. He took his time to show us each exhibit and interact with some of the friendlier animals, like the alpaca and deer. We even got to go into the condor habitat and see one of them fly. Their wingspans are huge! It was sad to hear about the abusive histories of some of the animals, but I was glad to see they're in a safer place. I read some reviews of people complaining of the habitats animals are in, but the staff are doing what they can with the limited resources they have. This is not America and we need to be mindful and sensitive of that. They are doing what they can and I applaud them for that.At the end of our tour, my husband and I gladly gave a donation."

They make the condors fly over you, it is cool... but I have a feeling the condors don't appreciate being chased and forced to fly.Hindsight I would have skipped it, not sure why it has such a high rating on Trip Advisor."

After finally figuring out through their website that is improperly listed here (google it) you can buy your ticket and get transport to their location for S/ 30. Great deal right? Well everything went smooth till 15 people got into a van made for 9 tops. We got to the sanctuary, it did have good parts like close contact with local animals. However you are rushed through with a guide there is no taking your time at the exhibits. The animals are in very cramped quartets, especially the fox who was essentially in 4' x4' cage. There reintroduction plans for young animals is sad. They have a 6 month old condor that has no space to fly more then three flaps. The young puma who they plan or releasing has little to know real world experience as it lives in a cage with its mother and two adults.  At the end of the day I know they mean well and I did donate knowing that they are doing good things for animals in need. They truly need help from a zoologist or two which is why I would still say go do they can make improvements.Lastly the way home. What a mess. We were dropped off at the blanco Jesus. The driver said ten minutes. Before we knew it everyone was out of the van and on a tour bus. After a minute a person other than the driver came over and informed us to head into the bus. 40 minutes later we finally made it back to Cusco. This is my experience I hope yours is better."

They have also added many parrots and some monkeys to the animals that they are now caring for and while it is sad that this is something that is actually needed, it is good to see that they receive enough support to continue to grow and take in animals that are injured or miss-treated."

We went to the main square in Cuzco to their office to sign up for an excursion and were told it would be a half hour drive out, one hour with the animals, and a half hour back. Fine. But that's not how it worked out. It took 70 minutes to get out there, not because it was a far distance, but because it was a \"tourist\" route with a drive through the squares of Cuzco, and a stop at one of the ruins to take pictures. Really?!? We were confused. When we arrived at the sanctuary, we were rushed through in 27 minutes. Yes, we did spend some quality although very brief time with the condors, but everything else was a \"run through\". And the guide didn't mention the hairless dogs that were there (which we were told elsewhere were bred in Peru because of the fleas). Nor were we told of other cages which held species of monkey indigenous to Peru, many more birds, and who knows what else. Frustrating! There was also a gift shop which sold items made from alpaca hair - fine, beautiful, colorful, well-made items whose sale was intended to raise further money for the sanctuary. However, there was little time for us to purchase anything. Thankfully I was made aware of this by fellow tourists and was prepared mentally beforehand to know exactly what I was looking for. The bus driver very rudely ordered us back on the bus. Vamoose, vamoose! And now began the ride back with yet another lengthy stop at another ruin for pictures, time which would have been better spent at the animal sanctuary. Now we were doubly and triply frustrated. Thankfully, we were not the only ones. And thankfully, one of our assorted group spoke fluent Spanish. He expressed his frustration, politely, to a tour guide on the bus but was brushed off. Four of us decided we needed to go to the main office back in Cuzco and speak out rather than let other people be railroaded through such a disappointing experience. There we were told that we hadn't read the information correctly on the website, or that the person who signed us up and took our money hadn't explained things correctly. When we went to the website and pointed out the specifics, he refused to listen. We don't speak Spanish, and he refused to acknowledge us until....I looked him straight in the eye and said that I would go on TripAdvisor, express our disappointment and discourage others from going. Immediately he understood me and offered a full refund. Did we take it! Yes, because they were in the wrong.If you go on this excursion, make sure you have all details in place. You can even refer to this review. This could be a very wonderful experience if you get what is advertised on the website. The rating we give refers to our total experience, not to the sanctuary itself."

Those who can be are released once they are rehabilitated, and those who can not are kept safe at the sanctuary.

Anyway, the whole thing took about 2 hours. I was hoping to see more animals, but it was OK. The tour guide's English wasn't as good as my Spanish so we did most of the tour in Spanish. The tour guide told me at the beginning of the tour that I should tip him for his services (I hope this means they don't pay him anything and he's working for tips). A trip to the gift shop is probably in order, but too much pressure to buy something. I didn't feel rushed to see all the animals at all. Glad I went. I would recommend it if you have the time. Probably money better spent here than 25 soles just to walk into the church on the main square (in my humble opinion)."

The sanctuary also runs a small weaving exhibit, which showcases how alpaca wool is transformed from fiber to colorful woven goods.

You are so close to all these animals who were treated terribly and are now being nursed back to health and given a chance to live and reproduce. Many of the animals you will see are also endangered. It doesn't cost anything to go (so they say but that wasn't my case) but they will follow you around the store and try to find a way to get money out of you; I donated 10 soles and was still haggled afterwards when they tried to get me to pay for a girl who rode up there in the same van even though she wasn't actually WITH me which pissed me off.

Our tour guide was attacked by a new condor and was immediately put on \"time-out\" in a separate pen. After that they push the condors up to the top of the enclosure to get them to fly over your head. I felt a bit bad that they were herded like that for people's entertainment but this was a minor gripe. This location is supported by donations so please make sure to drop some money off."

We just walked to the main square in cusco and there was a man with a brochure asking people to visit. We had already looked it up on trip advisor and wanted to do it, so he rang his driver and within 5 minutes a big taxi was there to take us. 25soles each person. Taxi was clean and the driver spoke English. The sanctuary was brilliant!!! Puma, macaws, condors, eagles, lama, alpaca and more. Guide spoke English and told us about each individual animal. Where it was rescued from, why it was rescued, and if the animal was able to be re released. They rely on donations (as the actual tour is free, the 25soles is transport). Beautiful place and very nice people. Highly recommend visiting! 10/10"

Taxi is easy as well. There is no fee for the Sanctuary itself but donations are greatly appreciated. Overall this place is really nice and they're trying to do a good thing. Most of the animals are from the black market, others were found injured and they're trying to rehabilitate them. The tour is fairly quick but the staff are nice and quite knowledgeable. The Pumas are quite a site, especially the new born. About 3 weeks old as of this posting. There are also Condors, Andean Bobcats, Vicunas, Guanacos, Macaws etc..... Go take a look for yourself.....make a donation.....take some great pictures. Kid friendly for sure, but I am an adult and enjoyed it quite a bit."

We understood the English tour even tough her English wasn't perfect.As for the animals - got to see vet cute llamas and alpacas (including teenage ones), went in the condor cage & saw them fly, 3 pumas up close, macaws, a fox, and some other peruvian animals and parrots. Also usual animals roaming free such as rabbits, ducks, guinea pigs and a beautiful stream in the middle. The animals seemed happy and well cared for, but needless to say pumas and condors need much larger cages than this family can provide."

The pumas, for instance, that were in the shelter were rescued from a show and because of the way they were treated in the show they will never be able to be released into the wild. The variety of animals there is also a unique experience and one can get a lot closer to them than in the wild.

Given they knew I was an English speaker, it would have been nice to get a guide that did as well. The animals are great and appear to be pretty well taken care of. At the end of the tour, I gave them my donation (while everyone stared at me to see how much I'd put it). They told me I had 15 more minutes before my driver would be back (I saw the driver off in the distance who was clearly ready). This 15 extra minutes is just a ploy to give you an escorted tour through their gift shop. After I was done, they asked me for $50sol for the visit. I told them I had already donated and they left me alone. Again, the animals were great and the drive to the location has some pretty amazing views, but the human interaction left something to be desired."

There are a few animals that they rescue but cannot be released back to the wild. I think it is very nice of them to do this for the animals. However I cannot help to feel sad for the animals in captive although they are nicely care by the people in the centre, the cages are still very small for these animals. I saw 3 pumas there, one is a female puma they rescue from a night club, her crawls have been removed so she can never go back to the wild. I saw her in a very small area and just cannot help feeling sad for her. There are also 6 condors, they are huge birds, they also cannot be released to the wild so they are in a netted area. Tho its bigger then the puma cages but these birds are really big and have wings spread around 8 foot or maybe even bigger. Again the area where they were kept are not very high and not very big at least in my opinion is not big enough for these big birds. I understand that soneone has to start somewhere and at least these people have good hearts for the animals. We didn't bring a lot of money with us that day as we did not expect to stop by this centre. At the end we only donated 200 soles. So if you plan to go, please donate generously so hopefully in the near future they can expand their facilities so these poor animals will have a bigger and more proper home. After all it is a nice place to visit if you like animals."

I\u00b4m writing this review a couple of months later so apologies if the details aren\u00b4t spot on.We were having difficulty finding information on exactly when the bus left as one user had mentioned there was one around 3:00 every afternoon but that was it. We ended up asking in a tour shop near the square and the guy called the sanctuary for us who then picked us up 5-10 minutes later. I think it cost us 10 soles more because it was an unscheduled pickup but we didn\u00b4t mind as the money goes towards funding the sanctuary.The sanctuary itself was fantastic with more variety of animals than we expected. We were greeted at the gate by a young billingual guide who spoke excellent English and knew a lot about the animals. By luck we arrived a few minutes after a llama had given birth which was a fun surprise for the staff as well. There were macaws and other tropical birds and of course the amazing condors that swoop down over your head and are so big! Other higlights were the 3 pumas (two rescued from a discoteca in Lima), a cranky vicu\u00f1a, 2 wild cats and a friendly deer.They didn\u00b4t push at all for donations but we were happy to give more at the end and then purchase some of the handmade products in the shop as it was probably the first place we were guaranteed to get the real baby alpaca wool products that all the market vendors claim to sell.Highly recommended!"

The staff are volunteers, some are students from the area who care about the animals. Any animal that can be is re-habilitated and released back into their environment but there are some animals that are outside of their territories (like the strange looking bird from Brazil) and have to remain as permanent \u00b4guests\u00b4.

He also seemed to be very knowledgeable, friendly, and, most important of all, to genuinely care about the animals there at the sanctuary as well as elsewhere in Peru. There is a nice little gift shop toward the entrance/exit of the sanctuary and I got several very great photos with native birds. Overall, this was a very good experience. My advice to others: just do not expect a really long time at the sanctuary. It can be completed by 90% of people in 15-45 minutes just depending on how much time they chose to spend on each step of the tour. My favorite parts of the tour were listening to the small baby animals and standing right beside a very large, very sociable acting native bird."

Look for reps wearing green vests, round trip costed 25 soles.Upon arrival, I was greeted by one of the workers who explained in detail in English about each animal (where they came from, what Cochahuasi is doing for them..etc). Saw many of the endangered animals up close, including the flights of the 3 condors.They do ask for a voluntary donation but were not pushy at all in the end. they also have a shop selling beautiful locally made textiles and clothing/accessories, with the proceeds going back to the sancutary.Overall an unique experience in Cusco, highly recommended for anyone wishing to go off the typical \"touristy\" path in Cusco and learn more about these endangered animals."

More animals and better enclosures, especially for the pumas. They have added a fiber and weaving demo and the gift shop is now truly impressive. They seem to have more visitors now, which is great, although the guides were a little rushed and too quickly herded us to the shop when another group showed up. Still, their mission is important and I'm sure they'll find the right balance. And, of course, the condors are amazing!"

The sanctuary is full of beautiful and well taken care of animals that each have an interesting and often sad story about how they ended up there. Some of the animals here included pumas, macaw parrots, guanacos, vicunas, Andean condors, storks, and white tail deer. One of the staff members greeted us as soon as we arrived and proceeded to show us around the sanctuary. She took us inside the Andean Condor enclosure, which was absolutely incredible. These birds are huge and will fly right over your head while you are in the enclosure. It is unlike anything you'll experience in the US. The Condors hopped around us and acted curious while our guide explained to us how endangered they are and that they hope to soon start a breeding program at the facility. It costs nothing to visit the sanctuary but they do accept donations, which we gladly gave. This place is a little bit of a drive outside of Cusco but we easily got there by taxi and it was well worth it."

Not really signposted and a bit out of the way so a taxi is probably the best way to get there unless you are on a tour that stops there. Entry is free, donations and/or buying from the gift shop is encouraged. Volunteer show you around and tell you the stories of how the animals got rescued, what they do at the sanctuary to help rehabilitate, their breeding programs and why some of them can no longer be released into the wild. There's a big collection of native animals - puma, Andean deer (which you can feed), macaws from 3 countries, alpaca, llama, vicuna, tortoise, a baby toucan and of course, the 3 majestic condors. There's also a pet hairless Peruvian dog. We learnt a lot of interesting facts about the types of animals as well as the individuals. As others have mentioned, you get to go into the condor cage and see them fly over your head, as well as get up close and person to have a good look at them. Absolutely amazing experience!"

I was amazed to find out and in fact did stand right next to two condors with their wings spread open. The place is safe and a very nice drive over the mountains overlooking Cusco. The dive took about a half hour at 35 mph. There are also Pumas, llamas, al pacas, etc. Even though caged, this is up close and the animals seem well cared for. The cost was only 20 soles for everything. This appears to be non-profit and they do accept donations but they do not ask for them or push anything on you. I highly recommend if you want to see condors up close and personal."

The Cochahuasi guide provided a very compelling explanation of the history of the animals and how they came to live at this sanctuary. You get a very close up, hands on type of tour. There is no charge to visit, but they ask for donations or you can shop at their store. The woven goods that they sell are all locally made and are the finest that I saw in Peru. The textiles are worthy of any museum store. The clerks will also explain the story woven into each piece.... ranging from wall hangings, to scarves, ponchos, bedspreads, all exquisite and made from the various wools, naturally dyed. To me, this was one of the well hidden highlights of Peru. Highly recommend for the mission, the animals, the textiles and for the local families that are supported by the sales in the store. This whole area is so beautiful and the Santuario is no exception."

During my all day Sacred Valley tour, the Ccochahuasi sanctuary was my first stop.By Northern American standards, it's small and some animals are in rather tight caging. However the people running the sanctuary and making the effort to save animals native to their country. My guide gave me insight in the various animals and why there are there. Some were there due to illegal smuggling, others because of injuries, some because the lost of habitat,etc.I will admit that learning the difference between Ilamas, Alpacas, Guanacos, and Vicuna was helpful.The Puma stayed in his area and didn't see him.There are several colorful parrots on site. There are also three Condors. The guide went to get food for them and told me when they start flying down to duck. The first time I thought that I ducked low enough. But I got brushed on my left side (almost knocked down) when he came flying. The second time I knew to duck lower!! The guide told me to me touched by a Condor will bring good luck, we will see!!The next area has a local woman demonstrating weaving techniques and the use of items for natural dyes. I got to get a great viewing and demo being the only person there.The guide requested a donation for the sanctuary. She wasn't pushy about it and grateful for the assistance.There is a small shop with Alpaca items on sale. I did purchased items that were reasonable in cost.While it don't look like much, stop by and pay a visit to learn about animals native to Peru"

Now we know the difference between llama, Alpaca, Vincuna and guanacos.Then across the road to the sanctuary. Puma, Condors, parrots, and many more. And a guide tells you about each and the rescues and some sad stories, and some happy ones. And to be in the aviary with the condors ...............It\u00b4s all free and all they ask is a donation and not in any demanding way.Yes easy to criticise them on cage size (see below - but they are far bigger, cleaner and better than many zoos) but these people care and have got off their backsides and are doing something. Lovely animals, lovely people, educational, and great feeling to be able to help in a tiny way. Highly recommended and it is on most peoples routes to and from the valley."

They let you get right next to them, and they will fly off which is kind of nerve racking considering how large they are. They even make a swooshing sound when they fly because of their size. They had 3 pumas though only 1 was visible, and other animals though not much. They ask for donations at the end and have a gift shop which helps them. Spent about 45 min there as a guide walked us through."

We had a volunteer show us round , which felt quite rushed. The enclosures were in bad conditions and in need of repair. We were told the stories of how the animals came to sanctuary and it was encouraging to hear that some animals are released into wild. The enclosure with the condors was amazing experience, there were 3 in there and u got to see them fly. At the end of visit u can choose free pen or whistle which was sweet. There is shop and small snack hut.we gave 50 soles donation. Visit Here if u want seething different to do and if u want to support a worthy charity!"

It isn't very commercialized like many \"petting zoos\" in the sacred valley that let you feed alpaca and llama, but it has a much better mission and has a broader selection of endangered animals. Please try to support them with a donation or purchase when you visit. The Condors and Puma are amazing."

It is run by two brothers, I think, with science backgrounds, who decided someone had to do something to educate people about the poaching of condors and declining populations and mistreatment of other animals native to the Andes. They rescue, rehabilitate and release, if possible, many species of animals. But the main attraction is the condors. They actually had a breeding pair, and were releasing young birds to the wild each year.I think it's important to see past the touristy veneer and get at least a glimpse of the real Peru, the real people and the real problems. The Santuario Animal Cochahuasi is a good place to start. But you will probably have to make your own arrangements to get there. Though it is right on a highly traveled road between Cusco and Pisaq, at the time I was there (July 2011) the owners said they didn't get too many tourists because they refused to pay the tour guides to stop there. They wanted every dollar possible to go directly to the animals. This is a don't-miss attraction in the Sacred Valley. They are dedicated to the important work they are doing, and your donation dollars (there is no admission fee) will help immensely. They have a great little gift shop, as well, and you can be assured your purchases are furthering the work."

A great small sanctuary worth seeing and a worthy cause to donate to.there is also a alpaca/lama petting ranch just down the road, only 4 or 5 pens, but a few different kinds and you can hand feed them, ask for grass if there is none out. also on donations, and has a shop that serves alcohol! haha."

Whever I travel, I try to support local animal charities, shelters, or humane organizations who care for animals. When in Peru, I looked for such a group prior to traveling and found this sole review for the Ccochahuasi Animal Sanctuary. I visited the sanctuary in May 2012 and was very impressed with the facility, the experienced guides and the up-close-and-personal experiences with unqie animals offered at this facility. It is approximately 45 minutes from Cuzco and admission is free - the center survives off visitor donations and certainly I was happy to give them one for the important work they do for animals in the region - rescuing them when injured or when traded illegally in the black market. We say many animals - including pumas and bobcats - but the flight of the magnificent condors was perhaps the highlight of the visit - these exquisite birds (wing span of up to 11 feet) flying so close that the force of their wings moves your hair. It was nothing short of spectacular. The guides are friendly and informed and seemed prepared to speak with travellers from many nationalities speaking many languages. I encourage any animal-lovers to visit the Sanctuary - help the animals by donating to this worthy cause - and bring back some souvenirs for your loved ones that go a long way to supporting the wildlife in Peru."

We were able to go inside the condor aviary and actually touch them. We saw several other animals as well that have been rescued from injury or bad situations. Some are in cages and others in an open area. There are llamas, hairless dog, tortoise, parrots and birds, coati, etc. They educate on why we should not buy souvenirs that use condor feathers and other important ways to help the animals and birds in Peru.
