Located in the heart of Hanoi, not hard to find. Also they provide 1 way free taxi to Spa. Ms. Snow has done everything including even my girlfriend's birthday cake! She takes in charge of all customers personally and assure their service to be top notch. I have enjoyed hot stone massage and my girlfriend has enjoyed hot stone massage, facial massage, foot massage, and complimentary cakes and drinks! I will be coming back for more next time. Wonderful place to be!"

Called in without an appointment yet nothing was too much trouble for the staff. I decided on a 45min foot massage after travelling 24hrs and then walking around seeing the sights I felt my feet needed a treat.And that it was. Simply excellent. So much so I have had one every day after trekking the sights. Each time I arrived without an appointment and each time the lovely reception lady remembered me and what massage I'd like. All the staff excellent every time. In fact I woke myself with my own snoring they had relaxed me so much. Sadly as I write I leave tomorrow evening but will try and squeeze in another before I go.Thanks again to you all at La Belle."

My boyfriend wanted a massage and I wanted a manicure and pedicure. The therapist Theresa was so good , she organised our treatment time so that we would be finished at the same time . Really good attention to detail and 100% brilliant customer service . Theresa even organised for some cocunut oil to be delivered to my hotel the same afternoon as I loved the one she used during the treatment so much . Not to pricey and definitely more proffesional than a lot of the massage places you see on the street ."

I can honestly say La Belle Spa is by far the best one I have come across. No one was outside heckling us on the street trying to force us in and when we went inside we were greeted by a very courteous young gentleman who offered us fresh cold water and a comfortable seat to peruse the menu. We decided to get the relaxation package which we paid buttons for when you think about what you get compared with western prices. We were shown to our own comfortable private room via lift, which was nice considering how much walking we'd done around Hanoi! The room was well equipped for a spa and much more elegant than most others I'd been to - real massage tables, clean towels, relaxing music and lighting, etc. The staff were very professional and polite, offered us silk pyjamas to change into and explained to us the process (as the relaxation package has many treatments!) The room was air conditioned and everything was just so wonderful that I actually drifted off to sleep! The girls did not talk or use their mobile phones at all during the treatments (things I've witnessed many times in other spas) and were very respectful of my privacy when I was getting on and off the bed/getting changed. The treatments ran a little longer than expected which I'm not complaining about! :) We were offered free drinks in the bar upstairs overlooking the city following our treatments, including beer! (Much more than other places that just offer tea in a little room). All in all it was a fabulous experience and the manager - who can speak fantastic English - is such a wonderful woman and ensured we had the best spa experience.I'll be going back!! Thank you La Belle Spa - I feel like a new woman!"

We spent a little time browsing the many choices of spas in Hanoi given that we are on a budget but at the same time felt we'd earned a treat.We got the full works with steam bath, body scrub, full body massage and facial. The manager was very friendly and welcoming and offered extra time/focus on our feet given how much walking around we'd done. During 2 months backpacking Indochina, and numerous spa visits this was the first place we'd been to that gave us a short questionnaire asking where we would like focus and what kind/style/pressure of massage we preferred. Staff took the information into account and personalised each of our experiences. There was no points in which I caught or sensed the masseuse on her phone which seems to be a regular occurrence out here.They overran with time a little which was nice given other places I've been to that feel a little rushed towards the end of time. La Belle Spa took their time to finish properly and ensure we were fully happy and relaxed. All in all very professional service and incredibly friendly staff. Would highly recommend this spa. You will not get better for your money in Hanoi. "

A bit overpriced for Vietnam though (300 vnd). Only bad thing: the therapist did not speak English, which was a bit annoying when I asked for less pressure. Otherwise the staff is really nice.However my friend had a manicure, which turned to be terrible because of bad nail polishing (although the nail polish was OPI)."

Nevertheless, I really needed a foot massage so I decided to check this place out, given the good reviews I had read online.Something done different here was that instead of sitting in a chair to have my foot massage, I was brought to one of the massage beds instead and asked to lie down.The massage was gentle and the masseuse did press every spot on the foot, but it felt rather mechanical as if she was just going through the motions. I felt relaxed, but no more than just sitting in one of those massage chairs and getting a foot massage."

In the massage area, we were provided with lockers for our clothes and silk coverup's to protect our modesty. I had chosen the Deep Tissue Massage and my husband, the Traditional Thai Massage. We both have regular massages in the states, and this massage was as good as any I have ever had. My husband felt the same way. Afterward, Snow took us up to the top floor, where I had a fabulous mango smoothie and my husband a mango lassie. It was the perfect way to end this relaxing sojourn.With all the many spa's advertising in Hanoi, I would say, \"make sure you stop here.

We had 2 female masseuses and I appreciate that we got a full 60 minutes of hands-on massage. Overall, the staff was friendly and professional and the facilities were clean.

The receptionist reassured us that the therapists are trained not to talk, be loud or ask for tip. Which was followed.My husband has a hard Thai massage, which he enjoyed but wasn't the best.My deep tissue was parts relaxing but the therapist lacked technique as she repeated the same movement in the same area, which caused pain.I ripped my therapist 100k vnd ($5 used) and she seemed happy.I've had better massages in Nha Trang and Saigon.

Never the less, the massage itself was wonderful!! I had not had one this good in ages (or even ever).

It seems to be under new management, i am not sure but I felt like that.

Room was simple but it was clean and spacious. Therapist was professional and I found that all the notes were followed correctly. It was appreciated!

Pros: 1) warm greetings upon arrival by the man at the entrance.2) friendly staff, Cong at registration. 3) attentive and apologetic staff (Cong) offered us a half price upon hearing our bad experience with the masseuses.

My masseur was able to quickly gauge my pain threshold and stay within that threshold for the entire massage.I did not have a booking and was able to be seen within 5 minutes.

The La Belle Spa in Ha Noi's Old Quarter offers marvelous treatments by a talented, super friendly, and excellent staff... The nice ambiance in both the rooms and waiting area make for a very relaxing experience indeed :) The receptionists speak excellent English, and can provide recommendations on the spa services that you're seeking. For a fraction of the costs for treatments that you'd pay outside of Viet Nam, be sure to take the time and enjoy a wonderful visit to La Belle -- you'll really enjoy it :))"

We were picked up and dropped off by taxi which the spa paid for, as well as a welcome drink and a free drink after the massage which was nice. The manager was really attentive and keen that we were happy with the service provided, and we felt well cared for. The actual massage (we opted for a couples oil massage) was really good, and we were really relaxed by the end of the hour. We paid 420,000vnd for a 60min oil massage which was a pretty good price I felt and worth it. ($19/\u00a312)The only thing was that since it was a couples massage a male massaged my husband and a female massaged me, but there wasn't a divide of sorts, nor did the woman try to keep me covered much, and I felt I could have had some sort of privacy as there was another man in the room! After the massage both the massage therapists asked my husband if we would like to tip them, which felt like a forced tip as they asked for it - we went for other trips/tours of the city and have been to other massage places where they did not ask for a tip. It was a pretty nice massage place, not a cheap looking place, so it was a bit surprising that we got asked specifically to tip! When my husband did give small change they said it wasn't enough and asked for a bigger tip! That would be the only negative I would say, as it was a bit awkward. There is a restaurant upstairs on the top floor with a nice view of the bustling streets where they serve drinks and food (both Vietnamese and western), and the food is tasty.Highly recommended massage place :)"

La Belle Spa was recommended to us, so we walked not far from our hotel and found them situated on a corner. My husband and I opted for a 90 minute massage. Blissful! Very relaxing and those muscles that were once aching and tired no longer in pain. After our massage the owner came to see us to see if we were satisfied then told us we could have a free drink upstairs at the restaurant. Once there though we saw other people's lovely meals and as it was now lunchtime, we decided to have a meal. The meal and drink were great. After our meal, the owner then called us a taxi to take us back to our hotel. A one way trip by taxi is also included in the cost of the massage. On their brochure it states pick up from hotel but since we had walked there we got our free ride home. Would recommend this place to anyone, great value for money and service number 1."

La Belle Spa is situated on the 2nd and 3rd floor of this building and they are all interlinked. Got a full body oil massage with hot stone at 75 minutes for about USD25 which is an acceptable price. I got a male masseur and he exerted the right amount of pressure and skill on the tensed parts. After that we finished it off with drink over the City Bar on top at the 5th floor with a city view to polish off the relaxing experience. Best of all there was a discount as we were using the spa below. Just so happens it was Liberation Day as well at Hanoi and the streets were lively. One slight minus is that my female friend was a bit discomfort due to the privacy curtains not fully pulled back as all massages was done in the same area. Would drop by next time at Hanoi again to try out their other massages."

It will even be possible to order food there in the future. There is an elevator going between the 2nd and the 5th floor which is appreciated when it is 30-35 degrees and almost 100% humidity.

We have tried various spa's in Hanoi and generally were disappointed with the quality and cleanliness. Even the spa at the Metropole lacks finesse. Considering the good reviews we were curious to try this one out.It proved to be one of our better experiences in Hanoi, but rated on a national scale there are quite a few better alternatives in Saigon.It is a small spa on the second floor of a downtown hotel. The reception is very friendly and helpful. They serve their own blend of black tea with cinnamon and ginger which is delicious.The massage rooms are good and clean, but not special.The spa provides different packages and we went for a 90 minute massage and a hot rub.Although the masseuses were friendly the actual treatment was only slightly better then average we both concluded. There was that lack of finesse in the massage we have found more often in Hanoi probably due to a lack of training. The limited range in skills quickly leads to you getting bored with the treatment. In our case, have the hot rub as well it did not reach the point of irritation.All in all one of our better experiences in Hanoi, but we are still looking for a spa that is not only clean and friendly, but offers a massage that can compare with the better places in South East Asia."

My wife and I booked into this spa to relax after a busy and enjoyable day sightseeing in Hanoi.The staff members were both friendly snd attentive and on arrival we were given refreshment and the opportunity to freshen up with a welcome shower. The whole establishment was very clean with wonderful relaxing aromas to enhance the tranquility. We opted for a joint couples room and the facility were happy to oblige us.We spent the next 90 minutes been throughly pampered with highly professional masseurs. We are frequent visitors to spa (monthly) and this was one of the best we have enjoyed this year.We are very happy to recommend this Spa (and the adjoining hotel too) Enjoy. "

We were at the Ma May Street hotel and had to walk south a few blocks to the other spa, since our hotel was booked. The treatments were fantastic. The relaxation room was mats on the floor. But, impressed they had a relaxation space given the location. The therapists were all highly professional, but lacked some communication skills. They knew enough to understand most of what you wanted. They provided a selection of oils. The price is dirt cheap by US standards. With the hotel discount, an hour massage was $35 and that included a tip. At these prices, we should get a massage every day."

By comparison with other spas in Hanoi this place isn't cheap but still much cheaper than the UK for this sort of quality establishment.

Tried their herbal therapy massage with the ylang ylang oil, after the massage with oil they put some heated plant / flower seeds to absorb the oil from your body. Th seeds are placed in some small cotton bag and heated, they use that to rub all over you to absorb the oil and it smells nice as well. Unlike other normal oil massage where they leave you feeling a bit oily even after they wipe you down, this one you come out feeling fresh and light with no oily feeling at all. If you go for regular oil massage, give this a try. It's a different experience & helps to sleep well at night. Good to try after long day out on foot exploring Hanoi."

We were given a private room with relaxing light background music. And the therapist was not chatty which I personally appreciate a lot! We were well treated and was delighted afterwards. Well energised for dinner!!"

I paid approx. AU$100 for a 4 hour service (with a discount) which i thought was an amazing price.thank you so much to the staff for a wonderful experience. i will defiantly be back"

We chose this spa based on the reviews and was rated as number 1 in Hanoi. However it's not quite as good as advertised or reviewed. The service was great and the body scrub was excellent. The lady was very polite and always smiling. The room was nice but not properly insulated from noise. I can hear conversations at the reception which had taken away the quietness of the place that I came for. I went for spa not just for smiles but for treatment. I didn't get the herbal bath, she just offered me to shower. The massage was ordinary. The lady kept on hitting my spinal chords and my back near the spinal is still hurting whilst writing this review. The massage steps were not consistent. She would do one set of steps on my right side and skipped some steps on the left. The facial treatment was ok but would have been better if the lady massaged my face rather than just applying the facial products. She massaged my head and shoulder whilst waiting for the facial product to set in which was nice.Overall, 3 stars."

Although I stayed at a hotel down the street, I used the spa services at La Siesta and had one of the best 90-minute massages ever from 'Nga' who also goes by the name Julia. For those who enjoy deep pressure, I highly recommend her technique, which was superb, similar to a Thai massage. She was able to get rid of a mid-back kink that had plagued me for many months. I only wish I had given her a bigger tip and want to let future customers know it's all right to give 50% or more of the massage cost as a tip -- I regretted not having more cash in hand for Nga, who earned it. Especially because the massage prices are very low compared to France or the US. The spa was small, quiet, clean and very, very nice all around. -- there is no need to go to the Metropole Hotel and pay way more."

The December winter weather, freshest vegetables in almost every of our meals and the locals' excellent service oriented spirit, has left me with such a fabulous memory of Hanoi.Apart from the well-organized 4 days 3 night tour to Hanoi Old Quarter and Ha Long Bay by La Siesta Hotel, the massage was another amazing experience I had together with my friends. The complimentary spa / massage service was one of the highlights of the package tour. Together with my friends, total 6 of us were so well-pampered by the dedicated, friendly and warm masseurs after returning from the 2 days cruise to Ha Long Bay. We will certainly return to Hanoi again."

I saw good reviews for La Siesta, so a friend and I went in the morning to try it out. To our delight, they had a special for morning bookings- even though they couldn't take us at the time of our walk-in, they asked us to return in about an hour- and still honored the special price. I had a 90 minute swedish massage, the coffee/orange scrub, and a facial- I think the total pre-tip was around $67 USD. The young woman who worked the desk area was so sweet and friendly- she made sure we felt comfortable- and, after we filled out a short pre-massage questionnaire, she read over it and confirmed what we had written to make sure she understood and could explain to the masseuses. (She also apologized for the little English they knew- but I thought they did just fine!) My masseuse checked with me several times to make sure the temperature, music, pressure, etc were ok. I thought it was just perfect! They offered us tea and sugared lotus seeds- and when we asked where we could buy some more lotus seeds, they packaged some for us in a little gift bag... Afterwards, the woman at the desk asked us how everything was- and genuinely urged us to be honest. Overall- it was wonderful. I rarely return to the same spa more than once- just because I like to try new spots- but I would definitely return here."

We only had a brief time in Hanoi so didn't want to take any chances - La siesta was the top choice.The head massage was amazing. The therapist had great technique and knew exactly what she was doing, and the pressure was just right. The facial was also very good - costing 600,000 VND and I believe they use pretty good products. The massage on the face was also very well planned out and the pressure just right. Technique was great. Some points of improvement: the foot lounge only had one song - need to add more songs to increase variety. My foot massage therapist left halfway for the restroom - a top spa should have policies for this. The towels were a bit damp and didn't feel fresh. I might have seen the ones we used being reused but I'm not 100% sure. The face rest was too hard and uncomfortable. Add a face rest padding to remedy this. These are changes that can be easily made and will make the spa a truly first class one. Right now it's still a tad shy from that title.Although, I find its services and ambience to be much more preferable than the ones on the streets. The receptionist are and professional and friendly - Rosie being the most remarkable. Special promotion where 90 mins treatment will give you a 45 min extra treatment for free. Only if you book before 12noon. For around 1 million VND you can get around 2 hours of full body treatment. One way free taxi ride from your hotel. I think the foot massage is just ok - not as good as their face and body massages. skipable and a bit pricey. The hot stone massages and facials are great so maybe go for those. The hotel itself is gorgeous. "

It is located on the 2nd floor of the La Siesta Hanoi Hotel and is a very pretty, tranquil setting with a professional but aesthetically pleasing ambience. The reception staff were delightful and the massage therapist was experienced & very attentive to our expectations. We were offered a discount as we were guests of the hotel. Highly recommend the relaxation massage. It was therapeutic after cycling and walking hundreds of kilometers over 3 weeks & relaxing at the same time. The therapists were very careful and asked several times whether their pressure was satisfactory. It was neither too firm nor too gentle. It was perfect."

We spent two hours here for a herbal relaxing massage and while the treatment itself was fantastic, the service at this hotel was exquisite. We had wandered in, and they were happy to send us straight up, organised out treatment while we sipped tea in the beautiful lounge. An afternoon very well spent and we will be heading there first when we return to Hanoi. I think we will probably even stay in the hotel to make the most of it!"

First time a sauna and salt stone massage at La Siesta Hotel and this week an aromatherapy massage at Diamond hotel. Both were amazing. I fell asleep for the first one - may have been even more relaxation from having a sauna first and 2nd one lost complete track of time and was very dozy. Both therapists were brilliant and gave very very smooth massages with just the right pressure. I like hard massages but not too hard and they were both perfect. Room temperature perfect too. Both therapists had really excellent skills and techniques. And what is so lovely about both these spas is that there is nothing clinical about them. You know you go into some treatment rooms and it looks like you have stepped into a room full of technology with this machine for this and that machine for that etc. at La Siesta spas you get a lovely Zen like environment, subtly decorated, lovely aromas and peace and quiet.Definitely, you must fit a treatment or 2 in if you are in Hanoi!"

The hotel is relatively small (and absolutely wonderful) so the spa area is not large. We were a group of 4 and we all took showers, changed, went down for breakfast, and then returned for massages. Our friends both had head and shoulder massages and reported that they were wonderful. My husband and I both upgraded our package so that we could have full body massages and they were very good.

The facial was awesome and my face felt so much better after all the sweating from the humid Hanoi air. The backache was good but in retrospect I should have gone for an Old Town package and got a full body (I didn't have enough time - did this on the day I was checking out and leaving Hanoi). The Earth package left my skin feeling amazing and was my favourite. If you have the time (close to 3 hrs) this is great! The staff were lovely each visit, friendly and professional.

I had the herbal massage they recomended, it was great - you know a massuse is great when they know when to push you and when to ease off without constantly needing to be told.They gave me a discount to celebrate Tet, I paid about $50 for 90mins (I think - by this time I'd concluded that everything in Vietnam is cheap and stopped doing any more than very rough conversions), a bit less than 1/2 of what I'd pay back home, which seems fair (things in Vietnam generally cost 1/4 to 1/2 of what they'd cost back home)."

From our initial enquiry phone call the staff couldn't have been more friendly, helpful and co-operative - all the while maintaining a gentle graciousness which was most appreciated. Arriving at this gorgeous place is like stepping into an oasis of calm, minimalist elegance, and yes it does have a zen like feel to it, We both had a herbal therapy massage using natural herbs which you could smell them mixing up prior to the treatment. The massage was excellent (and I have trained as a masseur so I'm picky!) The price was very reasonable and you get a 20% discount for future visits. Do yourself a favour and check this place out, you won't be sorry, we left blissed out and very contented. I will definitely return if I'm ever in Hanoi again."

It was easy to make an appointment and easy to interact with the person with whom you make the appointment. The Spa is located on the second floor of the hotel which makes it easy to access. You sit and immediately you are offered a warm tea to set the mood right. The service is simply amazing. I had a body scrub, massage, and facial and was truly impressed. The therapist was responsive to the type of services that I was looking for. The temperature in the rooms was to my liking. The tables were very comfortable and the oil and other products were clearly top of the line. I absolutely love the wooden bath tub and the shower. I have been to several spas throughout South East Asia and I frequently get Spa services (3 or so massages a month in the U.S. and 3 or so each day whenever I am in South Asia). This Spa easily ranks a the top of my list of Spa. I would place it in my top 5 in the region. I plan to stay at the hotel and use this Spa when in Hanoi in the future."

The atmosphere they created there was so relaxing and peaceful that it just melted the stress away. The masseurs were very professional and qualified and gave the most wonderful massage.

By the way, I strongly recommend you to go Le Siesta Spa as a guest at Hanoi Elegance Diamond Hotel. I got 15% discount for the first time. The rate went up to 25% at the second time."

We originally booked a hot stone massage but after having a look through the brochure, we decided to spoil ourselves and try a package . I cant remember the name but it included a Body wrap, flower bath, facial, one hour hot stone massage, meal and spa gift. Fantastic value at just over USD$100 per person. The staff were wonderful. very friendly and the therapists were excellent... always checking if the pressure was ok. We had just come from having many massages in Bangkok and although this was more expensive than the little spas you get on the street side - it was something we could not compare! La Siesta was wonderful and worth every dollar. Our meal of Pho and fresh fruits at the end of our treatment was perfect - just what we felt like after nearly three hours of indulgence. A taxi back to our hotel was also included and some money for this was given to us in an envelope. Very nice touch as we didnt feel like walking after all that relaxing :)Thank you very much to La Siesta for making our holiday a memorable one."

They helped me to choose a package which finally was a foot bath, scrub, flower bath and massage. The therapist checked on me several times for temperature in the room, pressure level of massage and the massage was as relaxing as I hoped it to be. The Spa is located in a hotel and there was a lot of noise around; it looks like all doors and windows are open; it did not bother me as I can easily switch off. Another thing to keep in mind is the minimum of privacy: you will undress yourself with therapist in front of you, after the scrub the therapist will be in shower with you to clean you and you have to get out of the bath with therapist in front of you; you also better tell them in advance if you do not like them to touch your breasts. I felt very relaxed after this treatment and that was exactly what I needed, so would recommend it and do it again if I would return to Hanoi."

            "review": "Over-priced and Under Massaged. I really really wanted to like this place. I stayed at one of the sister hotels, and received the small discount they offer (although they did of course try to up-sell me when I arrived). I was late for my appointment, for which I apologized and they were still able to accommodate me, which I appreciated. I also appreciated the included taxi back to my hotel... except the part where they forgot to pay the taxi, and then I was left at my hotel, trying to explain that it was supposed to be included (the front desk people at my hotel sorted it out, but it was awkward, and I wanted to be sure that the driver got paid).However. I had high expectations, having heard so much about the cheap, fabulous massages in Asia, and this was neither cheap nor fabulous. My spa technician (I will not say masseuse) spoke enough English to inquire as to my problem areas, and then actively avoided them. The pressure was hard enough, however, involved mostly pressing hard on bone, and avoiding muscle. At home, I regularly see a registered massage therapist, who is excellent, and I realize this wasn't going to be that good, but I just did not enjoy the treatment at all. A lengthy portion near the end involved wiping ones arms and legs down with warm wet towels. After 5 minutes of this, I had had enough, but I did not want to be rude, since the girl was obviously trying hard, and presumably doing what she was trained to do. I tried to imply that enough was enough, and go back to the massaging, and asked what kind of technique this was, as I had never encountered this much non-massaging in a massage. The answer was \"Vietnamese massage\" and another 5 - 10 minutes of toweling continued. I do not know whether or not wiping one with towels for a large part of the massage hour is indeed \"Vietnamese massage\" but it was certainly not what I wanted, and it was enough to put me off trying any further massages or spas in Vietnam. Given the response to the below review, I assume the spa folks are reading these, so let me say that your staff does not appear to be re-trained yet, and if wiping with towels is going to take up a sizable portion of the massage time, I suggest you mention that in your brochure, as Westerners such as me, who want a deep tissue massage do not expect it. I also had a facial, the best thing about which I can say is that it did not irritate my eyes at all, unlike most facials I have had at spas in North America. This was presumably because it was not really a \"facial\" that you would expect from a European or North American spa. For example, I asked if extractions were to be done, and they did not know the word.Noise levels: As previous reviewers pointed out, the walls are thin. I seemed to be the only customer there, but a staff room or something appears to be nearby - during my treatment, I could hear loud talking and laughter coming in through the door, which is not what a western tourist finds \"relaxing\" in a spa environment.Finally, while the place was very clean, I was not happy to find myself lying on a towel that did not cover the plastic bed beneath me. My arms and legs hung over the towel and felt disgusting laying on the plastic covering (that presumably others had sweated on before me.) Same with only being covered with a small towel instead of a sheet. I personally also felt extremely uncomfortable with the technician, who insisted on hanging all my clothes up for me including underwear (despite me asking her not to), having this small towel and the technician staring at me as I attempted to role over conservatively, and then had to twice ask her to leave the room while I got re-dressed. Different people have different comfort levels. I tried to express mine, and they were ignored or not understood. I think this place has potential - nice setting, nice furnishings, but in my opinion, the price is not justified."

It started out well, with a flower footbath and hot towels over the back and herbal tea. Lovely, clean layout with relaxing music. However the massage itself was not that good. The therapist asked how strong I like it and I said medium. It wasn't relaxing enough for my strained neck and back, and this was supposed to be the backache massage. Let me just say here that I expect a professional therapist to get the pressure right without asking a few times, and to find the painful spots and relax them without being told where they are. Well, this wasn't the case here. They offer a 20% off if you go back but I'd rather ask my boyfriend to give me a massage, and he is not a pro. So it was a nice pampering experience, welcome in the hustle and bustle of Hanoi, but not really deeply relaxing and relieving."

Hanoi is still not the place you go for a Spa holiday, but after a few days trekking the Sapa highlands a rub down is more of a need then a luxury. I chose la Siesta by default having stayed at the Essence Hotel which is a member of the eleganc hotel chain. The 10% discount plus the excellent level of service by the hotel made the decision making much easier. A second visit would entitle you to a 20% discount I was told.The reception was basic with mattresses serving as seats. It took some getting use to. It was an open reception thus not giving the privacy nor the intimacy you would expect in a boutique setting. The lady at the reception was however very welcoming and added warmth to the experience.The therapy room was luxurious and very well set up. The temperature, the music and the hygienic zen atmosphere was very pleasing and relaxing. I opted for the oil massage in view of the strained muscles of a veteran of Sapa. She spoke reasonable English, fairly well trained as a therapist belying her young age. Against my fairly senior Thai therapist in Kuala Lumpur who is currently my standard bearer she scored a credible 6. Technically she has a lot more to learn. The total 90 minute experience cost me usd 50. I wish it was a 2 HR session. I would rate the overall experience as a strong average."

After 90min of treatment, we felt really short-changed as the massage skills of the therapists were amateurish at best -- lacking in strengths and techniques, and the therapists spent a lot of time wiping our limbs with hot towels and then rinsing the towels.

Our course lasted 120 minutes and it was wonderful. The only things we recommended to management afterwards in a review that they give to every guest were adding music to wooden bath room and make better isolation from corridor sounds. In the middle it seems like a large group appeared somewhere nearby and they laughed and chatted too loud - our therapeutists had to come out and tell them to calm down. Frankly speaking, it didn't ruined the mood and everything else was ok, including middle tea brake and light snacks (were included into our package) in the ending. Recommend to all of you, 100% satisfaction guaranteed! To enhance the contrasting effect, you can first roam around old quarter for half day (to get maximum loudness effect) and afterwards to go to hotel room to rest OR go to some calm cafe and indulge yourself with couple of cakes and vietnamese coffee. We went to Highlands and continued our evening in Fanny's. You will find separate reviews for both soon."

It's located on the 2nd and 3rd floors of the Hanoi Elegance Diamond hotel.On all 4 occasions, the service was excellent. You're welcomed with a cool scented flannel and a cup of tea. They'll give you the menu to look over. When you tell them what you want (unless you order one of the big packages, in which case I'd recommend booking in advance) the girl WILL try to sell you either a bigger package or a longer massage. However, it is a soft sell, not at all pushy, so I didn't mind, the girls are just doing their job. On 2 occasions I did 'upgrade' as the recommendation did fit well with what I wanted, but the other 2 times I stuck with my original choice. If you don't want to 'upgrade' (you only want a foot massage for example) the easiest way is to tell them you don't have time for anything more. That way you avoid being rude, and the girl has done her job by asking you, so won't get in trouble with her boss!Once you've made your choice they'll give you an invoice to check and sign. You can pay by cash or credit card (though I believe paying by card carries an extra charge as with most places in Vietnam) Prices are in US$ but they'll accept payment in VND if you'd prefer. You can pay before or after the treatment.During all 4 treatments the therapist was very professional, and careful to check I was comfortable, that the temperature was OK, and that the strength of the massage was OK. If at any point you become uncomfortable (you start to feel cold for example) just tell her and she'll change it for you, no problem. They all spoke reasonable English.On the first day I just had the \"back ache\" 35 minute massage. I would have liked a longer one if I'd had the time, but I was going out for dinner. The massage was perfect to ease the aches of the flight!The second time I had the Herbal Therapy, which is a full body massage. They then use a bag of warm herbs, which they press onto the key muscles along your back and legs.The third time I had the coffee & honey body scrub which I really enjoyed. The session is listed as 50 minutes. The scrub itself lasts about 30 minutes. You're then 'wrapped' for about 5-10 minutes, while the therapist gives you a little head massage and prepares your bath. You then go into the bathroom where you wash the scrub off, and then relax in a wooden bath tub, with flowers, herbs and lime - it smelt lovely! And my skin felt great afterwards.The final time I had the Herbal Incense treatment, which is quite similar to the Herbal Therapy. You have a full body massage with oil. They then light an incense stick which they hold over parts of your body making them warm, helping the muscles to relax. I went for 90 minutes that time, and was sooooo relaxed afterwards!I enjoyed all 4 visits. The prices are so much cheaper than back home, so it felt great to be able to treat myself while on vacation! Each time made a very welcome break from the noise and craziness of Hanoi! The quality of the treatments and service is excellent. My only minor complaint is that for the Herbal Therapy and Herbal Incense I would have liked more of the heat treatment. But the massages themselves were still great.There are a great many spas and massage places in Hanoi, of varying price and quality. Personally, I would stay clear of the cheap places. Some of them have very poor reputations, and you just can't be sure what you're actually going to get! I feel it's worth paying a bit more (but still much less than home!) to be sure of good service. Of the few more upmarket places, I would guess La Siesta Spa is of similar quality (and price!) to the others. So which one you choose may simply depend on location and convenience for you. But, I can say with confidence that you'll have a good experience here.I was a guest at the Hanoi Elegance Ruby hotel (an excellent hotel) and so got a 20% discount, which meant that I really did get very good value for money!"

W got the couple room so 2 ladies were assigned to assist us. It looks so promising and also SF spa was high recommended in Hanoi, i guess the high expectations are what disappoints us. The massage were very very average. The 2 ladies were more interested in speaking to each other in their own language than to pay more attention to us. Sure we got a full 90 mins (they were showing us the clock before and after) but in between the session, they were walking in and out of the room several times and each time they reach for the oil or to walk to the other side of the bed it felt like a slow motion scene. The techniques were so-so, the session ended without much to be impressed. There were so many spa outlets in Hanoi but we paid more and came to SF spa because of the recommendations, but overall it was.. meh. I am certain you can find a cheaper and better spa out there."

I went lakeview branch which is near to hoan kiem lake and thang long theater.Facility itself was well maintained, clean and massage was nice.But if u r sensitive, particular with privacy and service then this is not the one you are looking for. I got the body scrub and full body massage. I totally understand other ppl could see my back or shoulder during massage because it's not private room. but they even didn't use curtain during body scrub which other ppl can see my whole upper body and even there's curtain, it's no use at all too, too thin so can be seen through everything. Even worse, I could hear a few times other ppl's surprised voice during my service. Luckily they covered my eyes :(Very disappointed and never expected this kind of thing which doesn't meet their reputation. Even street massage shop doesn't do service in this way.Their price range is also not really cheap compared to other competitors, much better to go hotel spa&massage shop honestly.I like their hot stone massage but I won't come back anymore."

We went to one of the two main branches, which is in Hanoi Corner. Walking there would be slightly confusing as you have to walk further until you see the shop. The alley is quite dark at night and you might wonder if you're at the right place.The spa has a great ambience. We were greeted with good hospitality and fluent English-speaking personnel. The serving of iced tea would be a peculiar one as usually massage parlours serve warm drinks. We were given forms to fill-up prior to the massage.We could write areas to focus on, and areas to avoid in the massage, as well as inform them regarding any illness/injuries that we have.Massage room was a floor above; a couple room was given, side-by-side. Room temperature was just nice, ambience was decent. Our feet was soaked in warm water containing ginger and lime.The massage lasted one hour. Major differences in a Vietnamese massage as compared to the rest were:1. Massage commenced in supine position first, and then prone.2. Massage started from scalp/face and downwards3. A warm pack was placed twice during the massage, once at the nape of neck, and another at lower back.We took a one-hour session, so the feeling was not \"thorough\" enough. Overall it was not the best massage but a good experience having Vietnamese style therapy for once."

On my last day in Hanoi, after three weeks of backpacking from south to north Vietnam, I decided to have a half day Spa at SF, the bigger one in city centre. Stayed at Nova Hotel, they recommended few spas but I got good feeling about this one so I called and booked. My first impression of the place was : fantastic. Reception was friendly. I even pushed my luck by coming half an hour before appointment time, and she received me straight away and arranged for everything. I was asked to wait, got nice tea and cold small towel served, and a form to fill in. A couple of minutes later, my therapist came to me and we went to the room. I love the decoration of the place and the ambience they provided. I choose to have one hour foot massage, one hour body Vietnam traditional massage and Mandi Susu (Milk Bath) at the end. I enjoyed the foot massage but enjoyed the body massage more. She was very careful, very polite, very caring and a very good therapist. I mean I am an Indonesian who is used to have massages and visit spas, so based on my experiences I know and I can feel what works for me and whats not. I probably was lucky, as I was the only customer in the room that day. Mandi Susu (Milk Bath) at the end was very relaxing after a very good massage. I felt seriously relaxed and good. Check out was smooth and no fuss. Added the tip to the bill and paid by credit card was no problem at all since I was lack of Dongs. It was a perfect end for a perfect holiday! Thanks SF! Warm regards from Germany!"

My 3 girlfriends and I went to SF Spa in the Old Quarter on the recommendation of our hotel concierge and our walking tour guide - he said it was his wife's favorite spa. Well they did not disappoint. We each had the same massages - 45 minute back, shoulders, neck massage and a 1 hour foot massage. We were all in the same room with curtains pulled between for our back massages. Not a big deal as we weren't doing a full body massage. This was by far the best back massage i have ever had and my friends agreed. She worked out so many knots I had in my back and neck with a perfect amount of pressure. Next we moved downstairs to another room where we all were seated in big lazy boys and given tea while we had a 1 hour foot massage. Again.... absolutely wonderful. The only negative i could possibly say is that the location is in the old quarter and there was quite a bit of noise coming from the school next door during our back massage and the street during our foot massage. Honestly this didn't bother me with the amazing massage I was getting (bring earplugs or headphones if you desire). The price was unbelievable at about $26. Absolutely worth calling and making an appointment while you are visiting Hanoi. Very easy to get to and the spa itself was very nicely done (wood and stones - very serene) and very clean.

The room I was in was clean and set the right mood for a spa session, with fresh flowers and lovely smells (it was a couples room but I was there alone). I visited both SF spa and Mido spa and found the atmosphere at SF spa much more relaxing and \"spa-like\". I had a massage, dead sea salt scrub and mud wrap. My therapist had limited English but was nice and professional and I enjoyed all three.After these I had a bikini wax. While I would happily recommend the massage, scrub and mud wrap, I would not recommend the wax. The wax they use seemed to be of not good quality, it was too hot and therefore painful and also did not do a very thorough job.To sum up, a very nice place for spa services but would not recommend getting a wax there."

I've been to a few spas in Hanoi within varying price brackets and decided that I would venture into SF Spa, 30 Cua Dong after reading great reviews online. I booked the SF Spa Signature package but being an high level athlete the type of massage I required was stronger than a traditional Vietnamese massage. I asked if I could swap the massage component to a Thai Massage and the spa quickly obliged.I am a British born Vietnamese and I have a lot of family in Hanoi and they were trying to discourage me from using an \"expensive\" spa citing that this spa would be just like the cheaper alternatives. Boy were they wrong!!The venue was very clean, ambient, temperature and lighting just right, staff super friendly and professional and spoke English very well. The pre-massage steam was fantastic and the actual Thai massage; honestly was one of the best I have had and I'm a regular spa visitor in London. If you want a massage book with Thao. She is strong, polite, very professional and can have a laugh too when she presented me with the disposable panties. \"Sexy hey?\" Thao is very attentive, always making sure and checking to see if the pressure of the massage strokes were ok, but without ruining the relaxation element of the massage. I'm not sure if tipping is necessary but I tipped Thao 200,000 VN\u0110. Honestly she deserves more so get your wallets out and tip away. A massage package in London of this calibre would cost over \u00a3180.00. This was all for about \u00a330.00. Great value and the best in Hanoi for sure. I would bet against anyone that can find a better spa than this in Hanoi. 5**."

I selected what services I wanted (75 min sports massage and Brazilian wax) and was given tea while I waited on the masseuse. Prior to walking up to the massage room, the receptionist asked me if it was okay if a woman received waxing services in the same room as me while I got massaged. She asked the woman getting waxed the same thing. We both were extremely hesitant and told her that we would prefer not to be in the same room. I assumed they would figure out an alternative so we didn't have to be in the same room. Little did I know... I was then escorted to the massage room (a couples massage room with 2 tables and no privacy screen), changed, put my belongings in a locker that was provided and laid down on the massage table. The actual quality of my sports massage was excellent - the pressure was great and the masseuse focused on my problem areas. However, 10 minutes into the massage, the receptionist interrupts the massage and asks again if the woman can get waxed in the same room as me. I'm annoyed, but know this is Vietnam and things don't work here like they do in the states, so I say \"okay\". The woman starts to get waxed on the table 2 feet away from me and the whole time I'm getting massaged, I hear hair being ripped off of this woman's body. There wasn't even any music to cover up the noises. The massage was NOT a relaxing experience for me. After my massage was done, I was told to continue to stay on the massage table until the woman in the room was done with her wax so I could have mine. I waited a good 15-20 minutes until I became fed up and left. The woman getting the wax said it was one of the worst waxes she's ever had (I think she got her legs waxed and a brazilian) and that I shouldn't stay. So I didn't.When I walked down to pay, the receptionist knew I was annoyed and gave me 10% off. She apologized profusely, but I mean...come on. No one wants to get a \"relaxing massage\" with the soundtrack of a woman next to them getting waxed. Not to mention, if I was more prude, I'd be very uncomfortable with a stranger seeing me naked on the massage table and seeing a semi-naked woman next to me."

This involved a jacuzzi, ginger scrub, a ginger oil massage, a foot wrap and a soak in a traditional wooden bath. When we got to the jacuzzi it was almost scalding hot and they seemed a little confused why I wouldn't get in and just sat awkwardly on the side! They were testing the water temperature with their hands and saying it was ok, which it clearly wasn't. They attempted to cool it down but there wasn't long enough to get it cool enough unfortunately. I usually like a hot bath but this was painful and the skin on my legs was turning red! Things improved during the ginger scrub and the massage, we enjoyed both of these. The only comments I have on those was that there was no music, meaning we had to listen to the traffic outside which was a little odd. Very unusual not to have music. We also had to listen to the therapists chatting away in the next room while we were left to relax. The music would drown this out somewhat. The foot wrap was nice enough. As the previous reviewer noted, the bath wasn't in a traditional wooden bath as the brochure and receptionist had said it was, it was basically another jacuzzi bath (although granted not as hot) so that was a shame. Overall when compared with UK prices this was worth the money and a nice experience, but one that could be easily improved."

            "review": "Excellent Services in a Soothing Ambience. Fortunately, SF Spa was a short walk from my hotel, raising its appeal on top of already very reasonable prices and its tasteful, soothing ambience. I opted for their \u201cSF Warming Winter package,\u201d which included a steam bath, ginger body scrub, massage, traditional wooden bathtub soak, and foot wrap.Quick side note: You are provided with disposable underwear for the steam room and all treatments, and while I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019d frown upon nakedness, they also aren\u2019t shy about leaving you topless during treatments (unlike the elaborate sheet draping routines that US masseuses perform to cover you up).The package I chose was awesome\u2014specifically the ginger scrub (both warming and exfoliating) and the massage. I requested more pressure, so as a result got a traditional Vietnamese massage, which utilized some very effective Chinese massage techniques as well. The bathtub soak was a different matter; it was actually not in a wooden bathtub and really not worth it. You step into a plastic Jacuzzi bath, with some milky/creamy substance in it and rose petals floating in each corner, then lay down for 20 minutes as weak jets pump out water and alternating colored lights illuminate the tub. It was the furthest thing from what I imagined a \u201cTraditional Vietnamese wooden bathtub soak\u201d would be. The foot wrap was also nothing special\u2014while nice, it\u2019s just a paraffin wrap like you would get in a nail salon, another way to extend the package time.Nonetheless, I liked the ambience and rest of the services so much that I decided to return toward the end of my stay in Hanoi for a mini facial and massage. Both times, I had the same technician for the entire time, and had to share a room (but thankfully, with my boyfriend; I can imagine it being awkward with a stranger). Some of the technicians don\u2019t speak good English, but they will call someone in to translate as needed for any transitions (such as moving to another room) that require instructions.While it\u2019s not mandatory to tip, I gave a cash tip immediately following the service directly to the technician, to ensure that they received it. SF Spa is well worth the trip, especially for the rock-bottom pricing (compared to what you\u2019d pay in the US, which would easily be 4x or more for the equivalent service)."

It's probably slightly pricey by Hanoi standards, but the decor and experience reflects this - lockers, fresh robes, fresh slippers are all included as standard. The first time I had a massage, but the pressure was far too strong given I'd indicated on the customer form that I wanted a soft massage. That was quickly resolved after I spoke to the masseuse, but it makes me wonder why you're asked to fill in a form if it isn't read.The second massage was brilliant, with a combined facial and massage. Pure heaven.The third day, I asked for the exact same facial and massage as the previous day. It was considerably worse with no consistency from the previous day. For 15 minutes of the facial the therapists sat on the vacant massage tables, which was completely different to the previous day where you were looked after for the entire hour. I raised this concern at the front desk and was offered a 5% discount on my massage only. I thought that was pretty cheeky considering my partner had the exact same treatment and was also unhappy. All in all, this place is fairly good, but not worth writing home about. For the premium price that you pay, I would expect consistency and a great massage on every visit."

You are offered tea and the changing rooms have lockers, so no need to worry about your belongings. The massage was good, meeting expectations. The only item I did not appreciate is the fact that you get the massage in a shared room (gender separated), where other people are getting their massages. Even if separated by a curtain, it spoiled the relaxing and privacy environment I expect in such a place"

As noted by others, my taxi was paid for by SF, and I was warmly welcomed on arrival. Given the length, my time also included a free lunch and refreshing drink. The massage was excellent, and the masseuse paid special attention to some of the problematic areas. With each treatment I sunk into deeper much needed relaxation. Mid way my lunch was brought- a lovely Vietnamese home cooked chicken and noodle soup. By the time I left- i felt I was floating. As I was leaving that night for a 24 hour plane trip- this was perfect to get myself ready.I highly recommend SF and look forward to the day when I can do a similar treatment again."

We got the Hotel to ring them first just to make sure they could fit us in and then went along.We were greeted by friendly staff who took us to a seating area and gave us 'menus' of massages on offer. Our free voucher was just for a foot massage but as the prices were very reasonable we decided to upgrade to a full Vietnamese one hour massage. You also fill in a form where they ask you if there is any part of your body you want to concentrate on or avoid.You are then taking to a changing room with lockers and you are given a dressing gown, slippers and little paper underpants to wear. You are then taken in a lift up to the massage room which is a very relaxing area with gentle music playing.The massage itself was wonderful, with soothing oiled massage but also lots of slapping and chopping. At one point the girl climbed up and walked up and down my back - it is a good job these Vietnamese girls are quite small. We all came out thoroughly relaxed and feeling great.I would recommend this Spa as a wonderful way to wind down after a hot day's sightseeing and at a price which is a fraction of what you would pay in an equivalent western Spa. A 60 minute Full Vietnamese massage was 450,000 Dong (about \u00a313)."

The massage tables are lined up in a row of 7 or 8 tables with some curtains for a bit of privacy - once it gets started, you'll melt away from noticing what's going on with anyone else! However, It's less easy to tune out the barking dogs and motorbikes outside - next time I might bring my earplugs, or they could turn up a fan or music.

Had a lot of experience in different spas and this one is the best, in terms of ambiance and price. Probably the second best after Evian Spa in Lotte because that one has an indoor pool.Looking at the main entrance, I thought it was just a normal Hanoian spa but this one has a bathroom, reception and they offer welcome drinks and cold towel. They let you fill out a form before the massage so you can tell exactly which part will be the focus and which part of your body to avoid. They also for pressure of the massage.Overall a great experience! Will definitely come back and recommend this."

All 4 of us were seated in large chairs together in one room, which was good for us as a family. 4 different massage therapists did each of our massages simultaneously . One full hour, and included a few minutes of neck and shoulders as well. Wish we'd discovered this place sooner as they seem to have a lot to offer and great prices."

The only thing that was inconsistent was the actual massage techniques; when something was done to one side of my body, it wasn't necessarily done to the other. There also wasn't open communication during the treatment - they didn't ask us if the pressure was okay and if we were comfortable. Overall, it was a peaceful afternoon."

Both my partner and I had 80 minute foot massages and the prices were so cheap compared to the UK! Your personal items are kept in a secure locker. The foot treatments were carried out in a dedicated room with lovely big leather recliners, very nearly fell asleep!! As a whole the experience was enjoyable. The only negative feedback, the therapist used the pumice stone for too long on the top of the foot which is a very sensitive area and the paraffin wax was excruciatingly hot as they dump your whole foot in the heater at once. All in all though we really enjoyed it."

I had said 6/7 out of 10 on the pressure scale and thought this was just right. Your belongings are locked away so it's all very secure.

All staff speak English and are in a uniform. The previous spa we went to the staff were wearing jeans etc and it made me doubt if they were qualified. I had no doubts at SF Spa.It was quite busy with people clearly returning for more treatments and being turned away due to being fully booked.We were taken in a lift upstairs and shown into a relaxing room, given robes and slippers - clothing and personal belongings are put into lockers and you retain the key.Pleasingly they were able to accommodate my husband and I in one room for our Vietnamese body massages. My husband had a male masseuse and I a female, she was small but a very strong lady! The massage was very firm, but of slapping goes on which is fine but can take you by surprise! My aching limbs were definitely pummelled and stretched back to where they should be by the end of the treatment. They put warm pillows under your back which helps you to relax.Really recommend, not expensive and worth it! We'd have gone back if we'd been in the area longer! "

There are two SF Spa locations in Hanoi, we went to the wrong one however the staff were kind and let us have our treatment there (the one by the train track).We opted for the Signature massage but swapped the Vietnamese massage to an aromatherapy one (no extra cost). Good points:Very clean, nicely lit and relaxing environment.Friendly staff and nice fruit juice.Relaxing massage in a room with comfortable temperature.What I would have changed:The Signature package is another 400,000 VND on top of just the aromatherapy 75 min massage (which was by far the best part). For the extra money you get 15 mins in a standard hot tub and small amount of face prodding with some sticky patches left under your eyes for 15 mins.This was good but I wouldn't say it warrants the extra cost. This is just personal opinion but I would save the money and have another 75 min aromatherapy massage!!"

Customer care is outstanding. Each individual, from the gentleman that opened our taxi door, to the receptionist and each therapist treated us with immense care and apt friendliness. You are made to feel special from the get go. The receptionist showed us in, explained in detail what each therapy entailed and then proceeded to give us complimentary herbal tea while we waited to be escorted to the therapy room. The rooms in itself are small and the ambiance very basic but, it was extremely clean and temperature controlled for optimal comfort. In reality that's all what you need! The one hour traditional Vietnamese massage was simply outstanding. It is a combination of palm, forearm and thumb treatment. Our two therapists Mien and Bien were simply INCREDIBLE, from all the massages I have had ranging from; Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka, this was undoubtedly the FINEST...BEST OF THE BEST. Our sincere thanks and compliments to both these two therapist for really taking care of us and making this experience so very special. We are definitely coming back and requesting these two.

I have been to the SF spa the last evening before I left back to home and I couldn't be dreaming of a better ending then this ^^!We went to the SF spa in the evening around 10pm and they said the spa was full but they had another location close by, so they arranged a taxi for us that they have paid... They did a really good service there!Ones at the other location... It was a very cosy place, everything was really relaxed and they were very kind! I hace decided to take a traditional Thai massage (420.000 dong for 60minutes. They let us fill in a paper were you needed to fill things in how you would like your massage...Ones at the massage everything was really relaxed... They guided us and told us what to do. They really knew what they were doing as it felt really great! After the massage it was like I was in another world, I felt satisfied!If you like to get a good massage that is worth his money, I would recommend to go to that place!"

We visited the newer facility (they have 2 locations). This one in near the Water Puppet Theater. We (4 people/2 couples) had several treatments (foot massage, Vietnamese body massage, facial, and manicure). All were very nice and done by professional therapist. If you are traveling with other people it is a lot of fun to have a foot massage at the same time. Hot water and paper shorts make for good conversation. If you have a reservation (highly recommend before you go) the Spa will pay your taxi fare to get to their location. They are located in the Old Quarter. A suggestion for the late afternoon and evening would be to got to the Water Puppet show, then the Spa close by, and then out to dinner at the Gia Ngu restaurant (not to far from the Spa/very good ratings on Tripadvisor)."

PLEASE NOTE: Please make sure you look up the address properly if you are using Google maps as there appears to be another SF spa which is also within the old quarter which is not this one. We got very lost looking for this SF spa for the second time we went back. This obviously isn't this spas fault but I just wanted to let people know.

The staff are lovely. Security of your posessions is good as there are lockers that have a digital keys which can only be opened with 'your' key and the managers combined. This 'key' is then put on your wrist so you can be massaged without it ever leaving your body. The elevator then takes you up to the treatment room. The hot stone full body massage was wonderful, at times I felt the stones too hot, but once I mentioned it ,they always checked I was comfortable. This type of massage can be a bit of a shock at first as the lady will mount the table your lying on and sit between your legs which can feel a little 'non british' at first ! Well worth it though and worth every dong. For this quality of massage in the UK, expect to pay approx double. Myself and my friend became addicted to the pampering and went on the have further massages during our travel in Vietnam.Choose a long session as the time simply flies !"

The last 5 minutes he walked on my back, got on the bed with me and hoisted me (with just my panties on) over his head and stretched my back. I felt a little exposed but the bottom line is no more back pain - even after a travel day of 42 hours back home!

While the staff provided recommendations for order of treatments (massage first versus facial), we didn't experience any pushy sales techniques. We completed questionnaires requesting areas to focus on during our massages, preexisting medical conditions, etc.After completing the questionnaires and selecting our spa treatments, we were escorted to our locker rooms. On the way to the locker room, we witnessed a staff member \"recycling\" slippers used by previous guests. Essentially, after the guests were finished using their slippers, the staff member repackaged the slippers into plastic bags for re-use. We each had our own locker with a key. After securing our valuables, we were taken upstairs to our treatment room. What we didn't expect was for our entire group to be accommodated into one large room. We were a group of three women and two men. For the massages, we removed all of our clothing and put on disposable underwear. While each of our beds were initially separated by gauze curtains, once the treatments started, the curtains were pulled back. If we looked up from our treatment beds, we could see each other. While we're all good friends, this was a little unsettling. The massage was okay. The room was a little chilly during the massage. I was happy with the body scrub. After the body scrub, I was provided a sheet to cover myself while I walked over to the shower room. The water pressure was great. Plenty of hot water was available. Afterwards, we could pay with cash or credit card. This was definitely a bonding experience for our group."

I got a hot stone massage and my friend got a sport massage, 90 minutes each. The massages were amazing - soooo much better (albeit pricier) than the cheap ones we got at other local massage parlors. We didn't much care for the hustle and bustle of Hanoi, so it was a delight to feel so far removed from the chaos of the city. A great place for tired travelers to indulge and rewind!"

As you enter the spa it feels right away that you are being transported to a really nice place and you forget you are in the middle of a busy and crazy market street.The reception is welcoming but it feels soulless ... its like speaking to robots trying to sell a service. With that said everything was pretty flawless. The service was great and the lady that did my coffe bodyscrub and facial was quite good and very professional. The VIP room was decorated nicely and amenities were spot on.I will definitely go back here if I am back in hanoi ... I just wished that they are a bit more human in their dealings but thats small fry."

It has only been open about a year and is very new and classy whereas the other place is 10 years old. The service was quiet, peaceful and very professional. A hot tub soak and a 2 hr massage with just the right mix of strength and relaxation tailored to your request. A questionnaire was given before hand to make sure they have all the right info...what problems you have, where to avoid, where to work on and what strength of massage you want.Secure locker for your cloths and valuables is given right at the beginning along with fresh disposable underclothes and a robe. The room was very nice and we left feeling relaxed and refreshed.Good price for a very professional service."

After some trial and error, SF Spa will definitely be my go-to shop for relaxation.The lobby is gorgeous and calming. The receptionists are very welcoming and immediately bring you tea or water. They offer you a vast menu of options for their services. During our first visit, we were able to get a room for three people to have a 1 hour massage, without a reservation. There were several other customers there as well, but they were fully prepared for unexpected visitors and the whole process was very efficient.You are asked to complete a questionnaire before you begin about the level of pressure you prefer, and if you have any problem areas they should avoid/concentrate on. The massage rooms are beautiful, and the noise from the street completely melts away. We opted for the 1 hour traditional Vietnamese massage, and were not disappointed. The therapist was very attentive and asked us if we were ok with the amount of pressure and if we needed anything several times throughout the hour. She seemed genuinely pleased to be there, which is a rare situation in my experience with massages here in Vietnam. I make a habit of checking my watch to ensure we receive the length of massage we paid for as a result of bad experiences at different establishments. We had no problems at SF Spa, and were not rushed out when it was over. They invited us to have more tea and relax in their lovely lobby until we were ready to pay and leave. I really appreciated this, because other massage shops have rushed us in, cut us short on time, and then rushed us out as if we were an inconvenience. They ask you to rate the quality of the massage when you are done, and are open to receiving any suggestions or comments. I received a lovely email from them later in the week thanking me for my patronage. SF Spa is a great find, and I will be returning as soon as possible."

When asked to pick an oil for the massage I asked what was in them and what were the fragrances and was told just to pick one! The therapist did a great job on the wax but hardly spoke at all. Every time I was asked to move, turn over and shown the shower it was like I was a dumb tourist who needed to be endured. At first I thought she couldn't speak English but at the end of the treatment when I was asked how was it and I told them- her English was great and she said that's how she treats all clients because she thinks they don't want to be spoken to.

This package consists of a steam bath/jacuzzi/sauna session, Vietnamese Massage, Mud Wrap, Mandi Susu (milk and rose bath), Mini Facial, Foot massage with Warm Stones. If I were to do it again, I would do things differently.First off, I shouldn't have selected the steam bath, and I would strongly suggests that people with low blood pressure (prone to fainting), any chest complaints or anyone already struggling with the Hanoi heat not do it either. It's extremely hot and I found it hard to breath; as a result, I ended up with a headache and feeling very dizzy after the 15 minutes was up. I accept responsibility for that, and was grateful they the staff brought me cold water and put the fan on me to help me recover. The Vietnamese massage was much gentler than I expected, however this is an oil massage so you should not expect the same pressure or deep kneading as you get from a dry massage. Covering my whole body in just one hour meant that the massage was not especially targeted. I would have liked more attention paid to my shoulders and back. There was construction work going on next door and the hammering was very audible through the wall during the whole treatment, which was unfortunate. The traffic noise also finds its way in. The staff re-arranged the order of my package so that I could do the Mandi Susu with my partner, who was having a different package treatment, next. The bath water was not warm enough, but the milk and rose mix made my skin feel wonderful. After that, I was served a meal and more cold drinking water, which was very welcome and finally restored my equilibrium after the steam bath; I think I enjoyed the second half of the package more than the first half as a result.I really liked the mud wrap and even fell asleep. However, if you want to do this treatment and you have allergies, you should definitely let the staff know when you are filling in your questionnaire before treatment starts. The mud contains something that makes your skin feel hot and prickly at first and then warm and tingly. I enjoyed the sensation but some people might react badly to it. The mini facial was lovely and involved a light exfoliation, some massaging and application of a few different lotions. Finally, the foot and leg massage with hot stones felt good and was much firmer and more satisfying than the Vietnamese massage.I think the staff at SF are talented and I think it's possible to have a really good experience here if you do a few things differently to me:--Ask lots of questions about the different options and really think about what you want (eg. if you want a firm massage to relieve tension, don't get the Vietnamese massage). I'm sure the staff would customise a package for you if you asked.--It sounds obvious, but take your personal weaknesses and health into account and don't try and be a hero, like me, if something feels wrong!--Check the Cua Dong location before booking and see if there is still construction going on next door; if so, go to the Cua Go location instead. Consider taking ear plugs to block out traffic noise."

I would recommend the steam batch too, if time allows, because I was so relaxed before the massage started that I think I actually melted into the massage table that first visit.

My aching muscles from a previous sapa trek did feel better after the massage. It was easier to walk up/down stairs after it. The scrub, however could have been longer though so that areas such as elbows, knees and feet can be really exfoliated. It feels pretty touch-and-go. The facial was very relaxing but I personally feel that the therapist could probably spend more time to help get the black and white heads out. A tiny imperfection about the otherwise professional service would be how the staff was a tad overly defensive when I gave them the feedback mentioned. Would I return to the spa for another visit? Yes. But I will probably only opt for the massage."

Once I arrived and saw the \"best of\" tripadvisor seals on the door, I thought for sure I was in the right place. (I did go to the address listed here). However, when I arrived they initially said they didn't do nails. Since I was already there, and already had blocked off a portion of my day, I looked at the menu of services to see whether I wanted a massage or other service. They then said that they would talk to their manager and find out if they could do nails, which they then agreed to. I was led upstairs to a room with 5 chairs set up to do foot massages, and given a choice of OPI nail colors. I chose green for my hands and pink for my toes, which the lady confirmed twice. She then put pink on my fingers, and left a lot of the paint on and around my nails. When I realized she was going to do the same for my feet, I asked if she would be scrubbing them. (Full disclosure: I have ezcema, which means my feet are particularly gross. They can crack, and bleed, and although they weren't doing this they were dry and just...gross. Feet are gross. Mine are grosser.) She said this would be extra, that all the $10 pedicure included was nail polish. I opted for the scrub service alone, which was fine. I guess...I mean we're in Vietnam and you can get a $5-$10 pedicure anywhere, and it usually includes that gross cheese grater for heels so I just wouldn't recommend the place for nails. That said the place smelled heavenly, and I bet they do great massags. I just should have taken them at their word that they don't do nails and not gotten a pedicure/manicure here! On my walk home I did see ANOTHER SF Spa (of course Hanoi has knock off salons!) and I wonder if maybe this is the place the other reviewer was talking about?"

(I will say that at one point I was given them to hold after they had been used for massaging but they were still too hot - no real problem but worth noting as it might be uncomfortable for others.)The Thai massage was great too! It's pretty full on and I'd never had a massage like it but again the therapist was really expert in pulling and pushing my body into all sorts of positions and stretches - she even walked on my back! It was great and I felt confident the therapist knew what she was doing - that sort of massage would bother me if it was in the wrong hands.The two facials, two foot massages, and leg wax I had were also great.This place is clean, relaxing and inviting and the staff are very professional, with the reception staff speaking good English. It's also great value with services less than half the cost of what I'd pay back home. No complaints from me - if you need some time out it's a great place for some rest and relaxation."

You get what you ask for and the woman massaging makes sure it is not too hard/soft during the massage. I can definitely recommend others to use this place, if you feel like having a massage for instance after a night on the train from Sapa or after a long flight. It is also a quite quiet place, where you can escape the constant noise from the scooters in the streets which is a bonus in itself."

Over the course of a couple of weeks I had a half leg wax, bikini wax, full scrub (Dead sea salt?) a facial (express yourself?) a full body massage and back and shoulder massage. The waxing was professionally done, wax the right temperature, not too painful, all very hygienic - would recommend - massages also good, they asked a lot if the pressure was OK, - by the third time I feel like they can proceed and I will tell them if its not!. Somehow I expected more from the facial - it seems very expensive compared to everything else which is very reasonably priced, a bit more than the super local places but still competitive and providing a service well above average for their cost. Lots of little extras - tea before and after, and they will pay a taxi fare up to 40,000 for you to get there - make this a nice experience. Providing robes for people to change in to if you have to be naked/semi naked for the treatments would be nice, it sometimes feels like you are being supervised getting undressed!"

I had a facial and it was wonderful. The therapist was very professional, the face massage was very good and relaxing and the products used seemed of high quality. When I explained that I did not wish to have a head massage she gave me an arm and hand massage instead which was a bonus. If you are just after a pedicure or manicure (or perhaps even a massage) it is probably worth going to someone cheaper but if you are having a face treatment which involves the use of products, definitely suggest it is worth the extra to come here (it will still be a lot cheaper than for an equivalent treatment at home). I note that some people have said it's difficult find, I didn't think so but perhaps that was because my hotel was in the Old Quarter and so I'd become fairly familiar with the streets."

When settling the payment, i asked to speak to the Manager to complain about this surcharge for the steambath as it was not worth it, but the receptionist did not want me to have a chance to talk to.

Being a frequent visitor to spas, I found it a bit strange to be escorted from one floor to another floor by lift, then be climbing up a winding flight of steps before reaching the treatment room. I understand this is because buildings in the old quarters sit on small surface areas and space is created by building up. However, it could have been more seamless if temperature and lighting could be kept more or less consistent throughout. From a cool and warmly lit reception, you go to a warm and brightly lit locker room. Then you take the lift fitted with stark white light, and make the last jaunt up a stuffy flight of stairs. The massage was above average but as a whole, the experience was not as relaxing as it has the potential to be."

I went back to the counter and said that we had reservations for this time. She then asked my name and said to wait again. Then she came up to us and asked if we minded by in a group room since the couples rooms were all busy. I said it didn't matter, but was disappointed. They asked us to fill out a card asking level of pressure we desired in the massage. I chose 9 and my wife chose 2. We both felt afterwards that the massages were somewhere in the 2 range. After the massage, we had prearranged for the steam room. It was okay, but the masseuse waited outside and therefore we felt a little pressure to finish quickly. Also, there were no extra towels available there, only the original towel we'd carried in from the massage room. Overall, the ambiance was nice. Everything was clean. The price was okay, but was it way better than what you can get at a small local massage studio? Not really. It was average."

My appointment was for a Back, Neck & Shoulder Massage and a Collagen-Biomatrix Facial at the Lakeview location (it's near the lake but there's no lake view, ha!). After my cool drink and completion of the usual first-time visiting forms, I was led to the dressing room to put away my belongings. Because I was only getting a 30-min massage and a facial (vs. a full-body treatment?), the staff member told me that I didn't need to change. Essentially, the vibe was \"Just ignore the robe, slippers and other items in the locker, dump your things, and come with me.\" I even pulled something out to ask...\"No, no, no, you don't need that.\" And off we went into an elevator. So, I went with the flow: Either the spa doesn't believe in relaxation from beginning to end or maybe just not that day...or maybe, locker items are for people who spa packages or something.My friend and I were led into a couple's room (she signed up for a massage, wrap and facial). I think because we walked in together, they were going to put us in one room, which was beautifully decorated by the way. The problem was, my friend is very modest and this was her first time in a spa. I wanted her to be comfortable so I echoed her request for separate rooms, but clearly, setting up a single room seemed to take the 3 staff members off-guard. They couldn't understand why we asked for separate rooms and there was a lot of back and forth among them...a lot. Sigh. Finally, we just gave up.As for my treatments, the massage was fine - nothing spectacular - and I was glad that I didn't have my usual knots in my back and shoulders or I would've been very annoyed that the technique wasn't very effective. Still, the massage was fine. The facial, which was something different that I'd never done before, was...different. I chose the collagen facial because an \"antioxidant-rich and moisturizing mask\" was involved, and my visits to Cambodia and Vietnam wreaked havoc on my face due to the intense sun and dirt (from tuktuk and motorcycle rides). I think I got some facial cleansing, facial massage, and then application of the mask along with whatever they brushed on top of it. While I was in that mask, I got a brief hand/arm massage and then I was left alone for a very long period of time. No explanation, just disappearance. I was underwhelmed re: the facial. Due to the technician's limited English, I didn't really know what was happening...and then it was over.I'd probably go back to try different treatments and to see if I would get a more satisfying experience, but for this first time, it was just okay."

However, the massage just wasn't up to much. Had the all-body 75-minute Vietnamese massage and asked the masseuse to focus on my back and shoulders. The only bit of my body that felt like she had done anything to it afterwards was my legs. However, 24 hours later a large bruise came up on one of them, suggesting even there she hadn't done a great job. Immediately after the massage we were handed review slips (but no tea/drink as others seem to have received) while payment went through. I'd been given the massage as a birthday present by my wife, who was there, so I wrote only \"great, thanks\" and left. Honestly, however, I would not return - though my wife seemed much happier with her massage.

We found the staff helpful, polite and professional. We both booked a Vietnamese 60 minute massage and both asked for a Medium pressure massage. After being shown to a therapy room on the fourth floor, our massage commenced. The room was comfortable and relaxing with three beds in total divided by light curtains. We were only two in the room and so we found it spacious and comfortable. The therapists were professional and we both really enjoyed our medium pressure massage (equivalent of a firm massage in the U.K.). We felt relaxed and great when we left the Spa. A great find in the middle of hectic Hanoi !"

My only problem is that when i wake up in the next day ( i did the massage at 7pm) i was with a mark in my leg because the massagist use her force in the wrong point.

One thing I have to say is Steam bath, it was too long to stay in a small and hot room. I don't recommend to choose it 'coz we can select a favorite one from saunas, steam bath and jag zee."

I am quite impressed by the speed of their response. We took a taxi from our hotel to the spa and the taxi fare was covered by the spa. As with the standard service, we were ushered to a waiting area where we served with ginger tea as we changed our shoes into slippers. We requested for sharing room and the three beds were separated by thin curtains for some privacy. The sharing room was unfortunately not a quiet room and we could hear alot of noise from the streets outside. My therapist started as normal but when I requested for extra aromatherapy oil for my back she didnt understand what I need, I repeated myself twice politely and her fellow therapist had to explain to her what I needed before my therapist went off making some comment. The massage technique and the flow seems somewhat \"disjointed\". Throughout, my therapist seems only interested in just getting the massage completed. with very little thought for the customer. Towards the end, I requested for a hot towel so that I may wipe myself and the therapist made a impatient sound. In most places, most spas it would be the standard to offer or at least check if the customer needs a hot towel after a oil massage. Ah well ..."

Provided you know what you are doing.My sad excuse for a massage therapist proceeded to repeatedly dig her elbow into the centre portion of my lower spine, which should never be done.Massage therapist continued even when I insisted she stop this dangerous and painful technique.As an aside, my privacy and the security of my personal property was compromised when two further clients and two more therapists entered room while I was being massaged. No privacy curtains between tables and all talk very disracting.Avoid this business."

It's super clean, very professional staff, very thorough process, and my massage lady was incredible. Out of this world. The massage rooms were basic but so lovely and clean. The music was very faint in the background which you could barely hear which is just superb (hate the music in these massage joints / tacky and always quite loud and repetitive. Grinds at my nerves). The staff were very professional and did not speak to each other which is another great point. Drives me nuts when they do while massaging you. We got the 60 min Vietnamese massage which is one of the best massages I've had. So much better than a Thai massage. Great joint, great experience. Highly highly recommend it. Prices were a bit higher than usual compared to similar places but still very cheap and reasonable."

I have just come back from an afternoon at SF spa - they picked me up for free from my hotel and I had wonderful experience overall.I had a back massage (I wish I could have tried the Vietnamese or Thai massage but I'm a little sun burnt on my legs and arms so didn't want to risk it irritating my skin!) a facial and a bikini wax (not quite as relaxing!)The back massage and facial were performed by one very sweet and friendly therapist, the pressure in the massage wasn't quite firm enough at first but I asked her for a little bit more and in the end my shoulders and back felt amazing! The facial was so relaxing and one of the best I've had. I'm a beauty therapist myself and go to many spas back in the UK... It was different from the standardised elemis or dermalogica facials I've had in the past but it was a nice change. She used lovely hot towels and a honey and orange face mask and did some wonderful pressure points round my scalp and face.I was a little apprehensive about the waxing (it's never pleasant but I usually go to someone I trust and know does a good job) however the therapist was brilliant, very experienced and even comforted me when it was painful! The prices are cheap compared to UK or US prices but maybe a little bit more expensive than some other massage places I've been to in the past in Hanoi. But the price is reflected in the quality of the treatment, range of treatments available and the lovely service and treatment rooms. I highly recommend this place if you want a caring, friendly and relaxing environment to chill out in :-)"

The reception is quite plain but as you go up the stairs to the treatment rooms they really are nice. We were in the same rooms for the massages too which was nice. As we went downstairs they give you tea and fruit and because it was New Year we also got a free gift.Total cost for all that was less than 1m Dong - so \u00a330 for three decent treatments. You could get it done cheaper elsewhere I expect but if you want some luxury like you have back home this is a good place to go and I would definitely recommend it."

My friend had finished her massage by the time I started and then had to wait until my massage was finished as my therapist had to paint her toes. We were there for nearly 3 hours for an hour and half treatment - lots of stuffing around - our other friends had left. We were told our taxi costs one way were covered but when we went to pay they charged us as the taxi had cost more than 40 000 dong so we had to pay the rest! My massage was fairly ordinary and my friend who also had the pedicure was left with 3 bleeding toes where she was nicked with the cuticle clippers which has developed into a fungal infection and secondary infection.

A bit disappointed at this.For potential customers: This place is willing to refund the incoming taxi fare or pay the taxi fare (one way) for you. And tip well!CONCLUSION: Spa was good. You can see this place is quite customer-oriented. They even gave you a questionnaire to fill in at the end, but the payment part totally spoiled the whole experience, so I will just give it an \"Average\" rating."

A welcome drink of water as you sit down and look at menu. We did 30min indian back, neck and shoulder (250vnd) then we had 75min SF Aromatherapy (560vnd) then we did another 75min Warm stone (599vnd). Massage room is very clean and modern with staff well trained with a massage we both enjoyed. Money safe box is supplied and key goes around your wrist which is very safe. Only negative is we had a room on level 3 road side so we could hear street noise, calming music needs to be turned up. They take visa and mastercard with no fee which was good. SF spa is a must try while in hanoi."

I have had massages in many places around the world, and this was THE best hands-down!My husband and I both visited the SF Spa on the last day of our Honeymoon. We had travelled up through Vietnam from Ho Chi Minh City and had spa treatments, including massages in each place we stayed. We had said over breakfast that morning that we loved Vietnam but probably wouldn't choose Hanoi again over other places we visited. After our visit to SF Spa we both vowed to come back just for another massage here! And three months later we are making plans to do just that!My husband had a Traditional Thai 120 min massage, which he raved about, and I had 90min aromatherapy massage and the 45 min Javanese Lulur body treatment. OMG - truly heavenly. The massage was perfection, the setting blissful, the treatment was indulgent and the service professional. Full body means full body, so if you aren't comfortable with your breasts being touched, mention this before starting. Although, I have to say, I had a full body scrub elsewhere earlier in the holiday and they did not go near my breasts. It felt disjointed and not as relaxing. I wouldn't have thought I would like to be touched on the naked breast, but it made the whole experience flow much better. It was not sexual in any way, it just felt normal and natural, so if you're unsure, I'd recommend giving it a go. You are warmly greeted at the door and given tea while discussing your options. She tailored our services for us and answered our questions. The prices are a little higher than other places in Vietnam, but still much, much lower than Australia and SOOOOO worth the money!Can't recommend this place enough."

I went on a saturday morning at around 9h30 and they took me straight away without a reservation (other highly noted Spa were telling me to come back at 10h30 even though there was no-one). SF spa is in a lovely building (don't be put off by the street being a little out of the way, it's means it's quieter than the other more central ones). The decor inside is just like the photo, the receptionist was really professional and the masseuse was really good. I had the indian head and shoulder massage and a basic facial. I have quite sensitive skin and at the end of the facial no redness, so the products they use of good quality and don't aggress the skin. I felt great after the massage and will probably go back in the week for a another, longer massage. Note that they have a small locker box as well for your valuables although I didn't use it. The prices are great value too."

The massage was very good and done second in a private room. The masseuse was skilled and it was quite relaxing. The foot treatment was totally self-indulgent. The scrubbing was thorough, the massage pretty good and the waxing a strangely pleasurable experience. Both feet are immersed in hot wax then wrapped in plastic film and places in heated plastic \"shoes\". The wax sets and is then peeled off after 15 minutes. Overall a very professional set up. My only criticism is that the foot treatment is in a communal room (room 22) with three other chairs. I had two ladies to the side of me having pedicures and nail painting. Both were chatting to the staff who used spot lamps to illuminate their work. This made it far less relaxing than I was expecting."

I found the spa had a lovely calming atmosphere and ambience, as soon as you walk in the hustle and bustle that is Hanoi seems to disappear. The interior design is lovely and you are welcomed with a lovely hot tea or water upon arrival. My masseuse Ha was lovely and in my opinion gave a lovely massage, was very friendly and seemed quite experinced. When I rang to make my appointment I specifically asked if I would be required to pay a tip on top of the cost of the massage (a very common thing in Vietnam and being Australian it is not really our culture to tip) I was told I only needed to tip if I felt the massage was worth it. In the end I did give a tip because I throughly enjoyed my experience. I gave Ha 100000VND ($6AU) but there was no request or expectation for one. I only paid the tip after I had paid for my massage at the quoted price and to my pleasure Ha was called to reception where I saw her being given the tip, so I was 100% certain that it went to her.Could I have got a cheaper massage somewhere? Probably yes but 599000VND ($36AU) for a 75 minute hot stone massage in my opinion is good value and I wanted to relax and not worry about getting tricked into a cheap massage and then be expected to literally pay the same price as a tip to the masseuse.I liked that before the massage you are given a safety box to put your valuables in (we all have iPhones, wallets etc) the box is locked in front of you and then you are given the key to put around your wrist during your treatment. It gave me a good sense of security.If I had more time I would go back for another treatment there are many to choose from.All in all I would recommend SF Spa to anyone for all the above reasons.The spa will pay for your cab there (up to 40000VND)."

After having been to several Spas during our trip, I was pleasantly surprised by the \"real spa feeling\". Relaxing atmosphere, very clean and extremely professional. One of the staff helped me deciding on the kind of massage for my back and the duration (without trying to push me into the most expensive option). I opted for the 90 min sports massage and a body scrub - the massage was lovely and though sometimes on the edge of what I thought I could take, it really was the first massage that really removed some of these persistent painful knots in my back. The masseuse was very skilled and attentive and checked with me regularly regarding the right pressure level. The body scrub left my skin wonderfully soft and moisturized. The only suggestion for improvement I have is to do the body scrubs at a bed away from the fan or to turn of the air con during the body scrub as I was getting cold when the scrub was applied. Overall - excellent!"

Things done well:Very clean; professional and clearly well trained masseuses; exceptional service; relaxing and detailed decor; Things they could work on:Honestly, this place has nothing to work on, it was great. More info:My friend and I are males in our mid-20s that have been traveling Vietnam for several weeks during the summer. On the last day of our trip, we decided to get one final massage before leaving Hanoi for the States. I get massages multiple times a year and both of us had already gotten a few massages during our trip because of how cheap they generally are. Both of us agreed that our massage at SF Spa, though a bit more expensive than our previous massages on the trip, was well worth it and still a ridiculous bargain relative to home. Although we had arrived without an appointment, they asked us to take a seat in a nice little waiting area, offered us tea or water, and had us in a room within 10 minutes. The place obviously pays attention to detail in order to ensure a relaxing and comfortable ambiance. They sat us with our feet in warm rose water before our massage, in a perfectly lit room with the perfect temperature and volume of typical spa music. They brought us a little safe box for us to put our passports, wallets, etc in, and then handed us the key on a little bracelet for us to keep during the massage. I had personally never seen this type of security before but thought it was an extra little layer of comfort that foreigners would appreciate. I typically aim for deep tissues because I like firm massages but went for for the warm stone massage (75 min, 599viet so about 30us) on a bit of a whim. I was hesitant to choose this because they're normally not firm enough but the massage was actually incredible. The stones were the perfect temperature and the masseuse was very obviously well trained. She worked in order and balanced the stone work with hand work. It was actually a bit firmer than my previous warm stone massages, which I appreciated. In either case, the masseuse kindly checked on me twice during the 75-minute massage so I had the opportunity to ask for something different if needed. Great place!"

The thing I loved about this facial was that they also included a hand passage whilst the mask was in and a back massage at the end.I then had the reflexology as my feet had been sore and swollen since arriving in the country. As I moved to a chair for this treatment heat bags were placed at 2 parts on my back to make me feel more comfortable. The reflexology was amazing and my feet and legs were no longer swollen and pain free at the end.My husband had a one hour Thai massage followed by a one hour aromatherapy massage. He says it was the best massage he has evere had.They also provided a free pick up from our hotel and provided a drink at the end.The total price for the 4 hours (2 hours each) was approx AU$80.You can get these services for less but we found this to be outstanding value given the environment and quality of service.

That was a bit cheaper at 550k and was ok, but we didn't have the same level of comfort and privacy, had to share a 5 bed room with another guy, luckily he was already lying face down when I had to undress myself.

Wow, I loved this place.The service was attentive, quick and made me feel special.I had a 90 minute aromatherapy massage.I was guided upstairs three flights of stairs to my room. The spa is dimmly lit and smells divine. The interior decoration is what you would expet at a very good western spa. There is plenty of wood to make you feel warm and welcome. My therapist definitely knew what she was doing. I have never enjoyed a treatment as much as this one. I paid 670K dong for the 90 minutes, which would be about $30. Professional, clean and affordable. A true oasis amongst the busyiness of Hanoi and a MUST stop for a refresher on arrival or departure."

The only downside (and this depends on what time of day/night you go) is that whilst drifting away mid massage we were suddenly disturbed by the sound of a train travelling behind the property.

I have always been very happy with the massages and the service provided. It certainly isn't the cheapest massage in town but the overall experience is well worth the cost. You get what you pay for and it is good value for money. At around $25 for a 75 minute massage, it's still only about 30% of the prices in my home city of Melbourne.

The service from the waiting to the private massage room was seamless and very professional. Same service as I've received in 5 star spas back home. My husband and I had the sports massage (deep tissue) - as small and petite the therapists were, they were extremely strong. I followed my massage with a 1 hour foot reflexology.

Staff seemed quite professional, asking for our skin type before applying treatments. I informed them I have sensitive skin, but our milk and rose petal bath had some oil put in it, akin to Tiger Balm, and I had to get out almost immediately as the burn was insane. I have found around this and other spas that either the Vietnamese don't know what the definition of 'a hot bath/spa' is, or the hot water system just doesn't cut it. I think the latter might be unlikely as most hotels have unlimited hot water. Our baths and spa were luke warm and eventually became so cold we had to get out early. While the staff were filling our milk bath, we were letting the facials sit for a while. We could hear them bucketing water from another room into our bath, which seemed like they were reusing someone else's water. On the plus side, we received complimentary pho and juice halfway through our package. Overall, not terrible but not the best either."

We were going to go to La Sietsa Spa (slightly more expensive than SF Spa), but couldn\u2019t get in when we wanted, so our hotel recommended SF Spa. I recognized the name from my Trip Advisor searches, so felt comfortable with the choice and am so glad we went.It was a perfect experience. First of all, it was the end of our first full day in Hanoi and we were fighting jet lag and air pollution, making the decision to do their four-hour Delux Package was a very easy one. It was four hours of pampering; it was bliss. Only $100 USD plus tip for magical \u2018me\u2019 time. This type of package in the USA would be $300-$500.When you arrive, you\u2019re immediately whisked out of the hectic city and into a haven of peace and quiet. They offer you water or hot tea while you fill out a quick form on any health issues. Then you\u2019re escorted to your room where they lock your valuables in a small, metal safe and put the key ring around my your wrist. The safe is with you for our entire stay. Our room included a steam/shower room, a large Jacuzzi (for two people) and two traditional massage tables. We\u2019d chosen the steam room over the Jacuzzi, but if you\u2019re a couple, it\u2019d be fun to do the Jacuzzi.Starting with the Aroma Therapy Massage, the natural products and oils they use started the relaxation process immediately. You can choose the essential oil (delicate, naturally fresh, energy, indulge, forest fragrance or exotic), but we let them choose for us and we could immediately feel the improved circulation and release of tension as they skillfully massaged our tired bodies.Next came the Body Exfoliation with Dead Sea Salt. It\u2019s called the Pearl on their menu and included an invigorating blend of essential oils. The FULL BODY (including breasts and stomach) scrub was stimulating and definitely exfoliated and softened the skin. I hadn\u2019t realized how tender my underarms are.In the background, the relaxing music was subtle, allowing the sounds of the outside world to periodically enter the room: a horn honk, a train whistle, and birds chirping.Into the steam room to further moisturize the skin and then a shower and shampoo before the Collagen Anti-Aging Facial. I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m past the point of \u2018anti-aging\u2019 but I\u2019ll take an antioxidant-rich and moisturizing mask any day! Made from original collagen of cow skin which has an effect on the color and the texture of the skin\u2026OK. But I do know that collagen helps provide firmness and elasticity to your skin. We actually fell asleep during this process. Not sure if it actually did anything, buy my face felt great afterwards.Finally, you end with a Foot Reflex Massage out in a central room with comfortable chairs. You\u2019re offered some more tea and a little treat while they expertly work over your feet and lower leg. Reflexology is supposed to help balance your body by focusing on the foot\u2019s energy points. It was a nice way to \u2018re-enter\u2019 civilization before stepping out into the world of motorbikes and mass humanity.Before we left Hanoi, we went back for a two-hour session which included the Warm Stone Massage (actually HOT stone) and Foot Reflex Massage. The Warm Stone Massage treatment blends the therapeutic properties of heated basalt stones with Swedish massage techniques to deeply penetrate tight muscles, improve circulation and promote a sense of well-being. And yes, we left with a keen sense of well-being.Overall, SF is very clean and sanitary. The linens and blankets are fresh. There are fresh flowers everywhere and the lighting and volume level of the music is perfect. The staff is friendly and professional. Not the cheapest place, but worth every penny. Every client is a tourist as it is way too expensive for locals to utilize.The only recommendation I\u2019d make is that they should offer an Oxygen Bar. Hanoi is among the most polluted cities in Asia and the most polluted in Southeast Asia. Traffic is the main contributor to air pollution in the city, with the content of PM10 (particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter) being four times higher than the alarm level set by the World Health Organization. PM10 are a major health concern because they can be inhaled into and accumulate in the respiratory system through normal facial masks. By the time I left Hanoi, I had acute bronchitis \u2026 so beware!With an Oxygen Bar, I\u2019d have gone very day and paid whatever price they wanted to set!"

We chose SF because it was easy walking distance from our hotel, and it was a fantastic choice. My therapist Nguyet was top notch--she worked me as deeply and thoroughly as anyone I have encountered in the US, plus the facial I tacked on left my skin glowing and refreshed. While it's not one of the mind-blowingly cheap spas I encountered elsewhere in Vietnam, I feel the atmosphere and service are definitely worth the upgrade. That said, it's still WAY cheaper than similar places I visit in the US. If I could get a 90 minute massage here in Chicago for $35 I'd get one twice a week."

My massage was thorough and deep, and I felt the staff were extremely professional and attentive. Their products seemed to be quality, and they took their time. As for our valuables (this I appreciated) - they locked them in a safe and put the key ring around my husband's wrist. The safe was in our line of vision for our entire stay. I've read about other situations where money has gone missing, or there being a lack of security services. Not the case here. Overall, it was the perfect getaway from the madness grit of the city.

The spa looks good, quite pleasant to be in, everything made by wood and with ambient lighting, The spa offers a big variety of services: massages, waxing, face treatments, nail care and some packages. The price is medium: for example basic foot massage cost 330 000vnd/ 1 hour, manicure 80 000 vnd+color 50 000 vnd, vietnamese massage 60 min- 399 000 vnd and traditional thai- 420 000 vnd, the most expencive treatment is \"Delux\"- 2 070 000 vnd for 240 min (steam bath, aroma massage, body exfoliation with dead sea salt, collagen anti aging face and foot massage). I made a foot massage, which was pleasant, and a manicure without color (was offered O.P.I. varnish but limited number of colors). Would strongly recommend."

Definitely never heard of this as a popular or known form. Done shiatsu, Thai, Balinese before, but never Vietnamese.We asked the reception to tell us what Vietnamese massage is and was told it involves finger pressure with clapping movement. I told her I wanted hard rubbing and she recommended aromatherapy and I told her I didn't want oil massage.When the Vietnamese massage started, I was startled by the application of oil on my body. I thought I said I didn't want oil. Then I felt very annoyed by the light feathery touching by the masseur. I kept asking her to go harder. After my second plea, she went out of the room. I didn't know what was happening until someone came in and told me that if I wanted harder massage then I should go for shiatsu. I was naked and oiled at this point and I see no point to make any switches. Beside, the difference in the type of massage should be the technique and not the pressure. If I changed to shiatsu and it's done by the same masseur, it will still be soft. It's not like she is restricted by the laws of Vietnamese massage to only administer light rubbing for this particular massage.Terrible experience and would never return. This is not a cheap spa by Hanoi standards but I would have been happier spending the time and money elsewhere.They wanted to allocate us with a male and female masseur. I'm glad we rejected as the massage was conducted with us in underwear only and there was so much proximity to the chest area that you would never want to subject yourself in this with a strange man. What were they thinking?!"

I had a friend visiting last week so decided to go a bit more upmarket and tried SF Spa. The spa pedicure is around $15 but a completely different experience to my usual place: the salon is beautifully decorated and comfortable, staff are polite and smartly dressed in au dai and the pedicure professional and enjoyable, including a good foot scrub. I wouldn't go here for all my pedicures, but would definitely consider it again when friends are in town or for a treat now and again."

A week later we were in Hanoi on our return journey and booked in again. me for a 1 hr body massage and my wife 1hr foot,back/shoulders and neck. I had a lady masseur and my wife had a young male and wasn't totally comfortable with that but as it was just shoulders, neck etc thought little more about it. She was not offered the choice to begin with. The whole massage was very poor and unprofessional, just rubbing in circles. then as he asked her to lay on her back and he started massaging front of her neck, his hands moved downwards into totally inappropriate areas at which point she immediately stopped the masseur and complained to management, in fact 3 people overall. They apologised and offered half price which just to get out of the place and not cause a drama we accepted. My massage was just ok but that happens from time to time. We reported it to the hotel also and would strongly recommend if you use this place to be mindful of our experience."

He got a 2 hour massage (Swedish) and I got a 90 min massage (Swedish) and a 30 min salt scrub. Total was about $100 USD for both treatments. The venue was very clean, the staff was VERY professional so don't take what I'm going to say next the wrong way. My massage was lovely and relaxing but not a deep-tissue massage (hence, why it was so relaxing). We got Swedish which was the lightest (& the cheapest). I believe if you want a harder massage, you'll need to pay for it. The only odd thing was when my massage therapist turned me over on my back, she also massaged my chest for a short time...and then did the same with the salt scrub. It was professional as I stated but I was slightly uncomfortable. This just isn't done in the USA so maybe it's a cultural massage difference. Either way, just a note in case someone might be more modest than I about these things."

The premises is very welcoming when you first enter and the reception staff make you feel like you are the most important person there. I will return for another treatment when in Hanoi and would recommend this to any one who wants to treat themselves."

My boyfriend went with a 75 minute foot passage and was also very pleased. They had a special promotion going on and we were given a list of services to choose from that were complimentary. We both opted for the parafin wax on our hands and feet. This experience was also amazing. All of this and we only paid $50 total!"

I scheduled a foot massage and head and neck so I had a total of 90 minutes. it was definitely the best massage and overall spa experience I had in Vietnam (I had three total). My therapist was Soug (I would highly recommend her). She does a combination of Sweedish and deep tissue work and really understands the muscles and how to get tension out. The setting was quiet, comfortable, relaxing and very clean. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend this spa."

You enter a beautiful lobby and the one of the ladies will hand you a brochure outlining what they offer. They have just massages and many many special packages that I never used. Yes, as some said, they will try to up grade you but if you refuse they will not pressure you. You will be greeted in the lobby by the person that will be giving you the massage, and escorted upstairs to your room. They will then have you put all your valuables into a lock box for safekeeping. This I really like. They then washed your feet, smart move on their part. Most massages range from one to two hours and with the two hour massage, which I usually got, I walk away so relaxed and very refreshed. One of the smartest moves I ever made was to get a massage within two hours of arriving after a sixteen hour flight to Ha Noi. Also got one two hours before I left, which made my long flight home a real pleasure. If the girl isn\u2019t giving enough pressure just ask for more and she will be happy to oblige. If you are looking for a therapeutic sports massage this may not be the place If you go there three times you get a ten percent discount, which I used often. I was in Ha Noi for a little over two months and visited the place once or twice a week. Had a different girl each time except twice. All were a little different in their approach but well trained, which I can\u2019t say for the other places. Yes, more pricy than the others in Old Town, but you get what you paid for and then some. And this place is so clean and fresh.Just a little tip, if you leave and are hungry just turn left out of the spa and cross the next street, Pho Ly Nam De. There are three ladies that are serving excellent food on the street. I usually got the Vietnamese sandwich from one of them. But all had good food."

We paid for a 90min aroma massage with a complimentary 20 min deep cleansing facial but they gave us a total of 100 mins treatment only because they \"combined\" the shoulder massage into 1. Apparently both the massage and facial included a 10 min shoulder massage each so what should have been 20 mins got cut down to 10 mins. Anyway, the massage technique itself was not good. If a good massage is what you're after, this is not the place."

First impression was that the shop is considerably nicer than any other storefronts in the area. Kind of like a pretty girl standing out in a group of fat girls. Since none of us speak Vietnamese, it was a somewhat difficult process to narrow down Spa choices. One point to note: be sure to check their monthly specials. There was a sign on the table that they didn't tell us about when signing up. A friend noticed it while we were waiting to be escorted to our rooms. When we brought this up, they offered an additional 30 hot stone foot massage for free. Facilities: Not having visited other spas in Hanoi, I'd guess that the facilities are among the better options available in Hanoi. The rooms were clean and new, though I did not like having to share rooms. I didn't see any rooms with that would be exclusively used for one person. The jacuzzi also smelled a bit funny. Showers were available with the package and decent enough. Service: As mentioned by others, there was a lot of in/out traffic during the massage. The masseuse seemed confused as well since she asked me to get dressed after my 60 minute massage, only to find out upon escorting me from the room that I needed to undresss again because I was due another 30 minutes plus the fruit facial. Overall, the operations were the LEAST organized compared to every other spa that I've been to elsewhere throughout the world. Treatment: The actual massage was fine. But when I signed up for the relaxation package (advertised for three hours of service), I envisioned being massaged for more than an hour. The way it breaks down, you're only massaged about 70 minutes in total (60 for body massage and about 10 minutes for facial). The fruit facial was disappointing; it amounted to the masseuse putting a bunch of fruit on my face and leaving for at least ten minutes. During is time, the fruit juice kept running down my neck and into my ears, which was uncomfortable to say the least. It would have been a much better treatment if she had massaged me the whole time rather than just leaving me there to wonder what was going on. Summary: The value just wasn't what I had hoped for. I can't see myself returning and hope that other Hanoi spas that I will inevitably try over the next few days will be better."

On closer inspection there are a few improvements to be made...bit of wiring poking out above a bit of panelling, cracked and worn veneer on the little tables and a really crummy bathroom at the back (guys...this really needs improving!) and all of the flip flops are a man's uk size 11. I have Vietnamese sized feet so I opted to go barefoot to avoid looking like a complete idiot and killing myself on the many shiny wooden steps up to the treatment rooms (this is not the place for anyone with access issues I'm afraid, much of Vietnamese domestic architecture includes narrow five or six stories and no lifts).Anyway, the treatment rooms are done out very adequately I think and staff make a real effort to make you comfortable and relaxed, dimming the lights, good plinky plonky sound track as in many spas, excellent essential oils and top of the line products. I was given an excellent 1 hr long Swedish style massage and then had a very good mani-pedi ( I know people have moaned about these but it is all dependent on your therapist and mine was very good - if you aren't happy with what they're doing, stop them and tell them, they won't bite).My one main complaint however, and this is by no means a deal breaker, is that if you are a couple, you mostly get your treatments in the same room which is fine for massages but not if your husband is getting a back wax! I just hope it doesn't extend to the more intimate female waxing that needs to be done sometimes! That, coupled with the fact that there is a lot of noise of therapists rustling about in each others products/shelves/ drawers is a bit of a drawback.My feeling on leaving was that I'd had a great time and the noise and back waxing in close proximity were an amusing distraction. I suppose on another day I would have found it annoying but I certainly wouldn't hesitate to go back for another treatment and I would certainly recommend it to others."

Also, be ready for a serious up-sell - you will be pestered to buy a more expensive package no matter which one you select. We said \"no thanks\" a number of times, but the hard sell felt pretty unrelenting. Then they really gouged us with unnecessarily high fees to pay with a credit card and a terrible exchange rate when we opted instead to pay in USD (which was very common and easy elsewhere in Vietnam). It's not expensive, but you get what you pay for...Later on during our stay in Hanoi, we went to the spa at the Hanoi Elegance (Diamond) hotel, which was a far far superior experience.

However, they called the hotel back immediately and said they had room. So we took a taxi there which they paid for. We were greeted out front by a one of their staff and she was polite. The waiting area was nicely decorated. But it goes downhill from there. The receptionist came and asked us what treatments we would like. Being pressed for time, we all selected a basic steam bath and a massage, nothing fancy. When we told her that, her entire expression changed. She became sulky and unenthusiastic. She then began to collect payment even before the session began. Then the manager came, asking us if we would like to do the jacuzzi instead of the steambath, saying that the jacuzzi could fit 4 of us. We declined and she became pushy. Insisting that this is better and we would not have to wait. I declined like 3 times more before she left us alone for abit. From there, we waited like 25 mins. She just kept saying \"soon\" whenever we asked. Finally, we asked her if we could just have the jaccuzi instead so we could begin. However, we still waited another 15 mins before being ushered into the room.There certainly was a lack of privacy there. The staff kept walking in and out and chatting whilst we were changing. One even pulled the towel off my friend and pushed him toward the jacuzzi. After the jacuzzi, they told us to shower off but the showers had no hot water. And since this was winter, it was pretty unpleasant.During the massage, the 4 therapists were speaking to each other and laughing loudly. I felt this was unrelaxing and disturbing. Whilst doing the thai massage, she twisted my leg in an uncomfortable position and when I moved it back, she grabbed my leg, smacked it lightly and twisted it again. Massage was mediocre but the experience was ALOT worse.At the end of the massage, the 4 therapist just stood at the side, laughing amongst themselves, not seeing if we needed anything. When we went to the counter to ask if we could call a taxi, the manager ignored us completely and occupied herself with her nails and chatting to the receptionist. When I asked again, she waved her hand to signal me to wait. The only tinge of good service was the girl who greeted us when we arrived. She was the one who squeezed behind the counter, called us a taxi and helped us to direct the driver. Maybe lonely planet was served by her, explaining the recommendation.As for the spa experience and majority of service, it stunk. Avoid this place at all costs. Go to placencare spa. It's around the same price and FANTASTIC both massage and service wise."

The waiting area downstairs looks pretty nice, but is very busy and the staff is brusque and unenthusiastic. The massages themselves were decent but nothing special. The thai massage by oil was a bit misleading, in that hardly any oil was used. Everything about the place felt like it was optimized for maximum throughput, so the entire experience felt like being on an assembly line."

If you end up at the old address in the old town area however, they will pay for a taxi (one way) for you. They will also pay for a taxi from the spa to your hotel, if you happen to make your own way there.I chose the Aroma therapy massage. It cost 430 thousand Vietnamese dong for 90 minutes. I managed to fall asleep it was that relaxing. When I visited the spa was very busy and I had to make a booking for later in the day and pay a small deposit (though one deposit appears to cover a booking for 2-3 people). So if you are in a hurry, it may pay to call ahead. There are various packages to choose from including other massage types e.g. Swedish, Thai, Shiatsu, and other choices that inlcude body wraps, manicure and pedicure and waxing. Note that if you are a bit bashful, there were two massage beds in a single room so you may be massaged next to a total stranger."

I paid full price for both services (very reasonable by UK standards but probably not by Vietnamese), it is worth asking for a discount if you get more than one treatment. Non the less the staff were relentless in trying to sell me other products and I was made to feel a bit of a cheapskate for only having two treatments. The spa is open until about 10.30 and I visited at about 9.30pm, another lady had just come out of a massage as I arrived and as soon as the door closed behind her the reception staff burst out laughing. Not really a pleasent/polite way to behave. Anyway... the entrance lobby is beautiful worthy of a good UK spa and the treatment room was clean and well laid out. The lady that performed my treatment seemed competant enough but got board of cooling the wax before applying it about half way through the treatment. I didn't get burned but it was too hot.All in all, if you want a wax somewhere clean then this is a good place to go. If you want a relaxing/reasonably priced experience look elsewhere."

My husband and I found this place in our Lonely Planet guidebook which came with a fairly good recommendation. Upon arrival at the salon we were impressed with the decor and the quality of their brochure so we walked on in. Our payment was taken before the services had been provided and as the prices were quoted in US$ we too experienced the high conversion rate when paying in dong.We were ushered upstairs and into a single room with two massage tables and a shower in the corner. The therapists then instructed us to get undressed with no offer of a robe, towel or privacy i.e. leaving the room or at the very least turning around. They offered my husband a tiny pair of disposable underwear for modesty but then stood there staring waiting for him to change into them! I then had to ask them to leave the room before he did so. They expected me to strip completely naked and when I asked for a pair of disposable knickers they refused.During the massage the therapists spoke continuously, often laughing - I have a feeling at our expense. I found this to be distracting and extremely rude. I had left my wedding and engagement rings on during the massage and at one stage my therapist held up my hand so the other one could have a look! Once the massage was over we were told to hop in the shower together to rinse off, again without either of them vacating the room to allow for privacy. I got out of the shower first and had to walk a fair distance to get my own towel to dry off. When I then tried passing a towel to my husband so he could dry off, it was snatched out of my hand by one of the therepists and handed to him (by this time the disposable underwear were completely translucent) and then she just stood there staring at him while he tried to retain some level of modesty and dry himself off at the same time!Once the services were over and we were taken back downstairs to the reception area, we were told by the cashier that she had given us too much change and that we were now required to hand some back.Not the relaxing experience either of us were hoping for and I would recommend anyone thinking of making a stop to SF Salon & Spa to rethink that decision."

The staff were unprofessional and we left with the feeling that we'd been ripped off and treated like nothing more than walking dollar signs. We went in for massage and waxing services, and we were hopeful that the salon was of good quality by the professional appearance of their brochures and their higher end pricing structure. ($27 for 2 hour massage, $17 waxing)First, we were surprised by the method of collecting payment. They collected payment in full before the services began and used an extremely high conversion rate when converting prices (listed in $) to the local currency. They charged us 17,700 dong for each dollar, which is the highest rate we've encountered and 300 more than the luxury resort we stayed at!Once the services began, my husband and I were ushered together into a single room for all our services -- even waxings! The salon workers stood by as we undressed (no privacy) and chatted with each other in Vietnamese throughout our session (rude and distracting). Worst, we were subjected to the raging sounds of the street for much of our 2 hour session. The noises from the street echoed throughout the treatment room -- including screaming children and arguing adults -- and no one did anything to address the situation.Lastly, when our services were over, we asked the manager to change a large bill for smaller ones, so that we could tip the workers. Despite communicating quite well in English when collecting our payment, the manager suddenly didn't understand our request and insisted that she would split the entire bill amongst the workers herself. We had no intention of leaving the ENTIRE bill for the workers, particularly considering the circumstances, but we had to argue to get our bill returned. We ended up just leaving the small change we had, and the workers frowned when she gave it to them -- I guess they were expecting the huge tip she was trying to gather for them the first time. Needless to say, I can't recommend this spa to anyone. The prices are high, but the service is poor. We left feeling more stressed out and uncomfortable than we were when walking in! The best spa services we received were at hotels, and although they cost a bit more, we always received great service and the relaxing experience we were looking for. Stay away from SF Salon and Spa..."

Not only is this spa way better in terms of massage quality, it costs less too. They would be very successful if they were closer to Old Quarter, but even with the taxi ride, it still costs less than the other top spas. Their English is not great, so ask your hotel to make an appointment for you.The massage itself was highly skilled and they use a kneading shiatsu technique. Pressure was excellent and they hit all the right spots. Apparently the massage therapists see a larger share of the money even though they charge less, so you know your money is going to a good place.If I had to write some cons, it is that it is not as upscale and the distractions make it a less relaxing experience. That being said I would still take this massage over most 5 star hotel spa massages any day."

Went there early just as they were opening (good thing, they started getting busy as I was leaving). It is very hard to find, I was lost and going in circles on my motorbike and than I finally saw the light, it's hidden in a alley. I went in and was greeted with a welcoming smile and gratitude. As I was seated I was given a menu of the massages and another which had their business statement about teaching and employing the blind/visually impaired. I decided on the 90min Omamori Special. I was soon escorted to the changing room where I was told to change into their pants and shirt whilst keeping my underwear on (this isnt Thailand, it's very professional). After changing I was escorted to the massage bed where I was introduced to my masseuses, and told to take of shirt but keeping the pants on (the pants do not take away from the massage, don't fret). I was asked where if I had any pain or discomfort. I explained my right shoulder and back. Woah the pressure was perfect, and the attention to my aches were spot on (my shoulder honestly felt 100% better, my back is always in pain so that's a different story). Also she performed this massage on my neck, which I had never experienced and I was a bit tentative and stiffened up as the pressure made me nervous, but after I let myself go and allowed her to work this was the best feeling. My neck felt amazing what she did was quite magical. After the massage I was given some tea to relax and wasn't rushed to pay and leave, instead was allowed to sit, rest and let the massage sink in. I felt like I needed to tip the masseuse because it was that damn good, but was assured that the masseuse get a good salary and that they don't allow tips. Amazing thank you Omamori Spa, for making the start of my Vietnam road trip in one where I wasn't stiff and in pain"

The spa trains and employs staff who are vision impaired, and don't have access to the same resources that others have. The staff work happily alongside others who have sight - and you can see that this is a workplace with dignity for all."

The entering and leaving of the treatment room whilst having your massage is a slight interruption but for me was not a problem.The staff are so welcoming, lovely and friendly and their no tipping policy encourages ethical practice. My masseur was able to identify tensions very early on and really focuses on my problem areas. Such a fantastic massage at an extremely reasonable price!"

I was lucky to have the privilege of being treated by the manager. As soon as she started the treatment, she diagnosed by touch not only the shoulder problem but also my lifelong problems with pain and tension in the neck and shoulders. She combined traditional Vietnamese massage with the use of pressure points. I felt pleasantly achy afterwards and the next morning I could feel that the position of my shoulder had improved. I'm looking forward to going back next week.Not only an outstanding therapeutic practice, but also an ethical business which deserves support."

I had the same girl on both days who did a great job on my knotted up back and shoulders and my girlfriend had 2 different people she really enjoyed, the second one she said was the best massage she had in her life (masseur's name was Thang). We've been going to blind massage places throughout our trip as the massages are generally great and I think the whole concept is just brilliant in every way. Omamori was far and away the more professional and seems to have a very serious program in place for training and well fare for the blind masseurs as well as for the customers. The receptionist's are extremely fluent in English and professional. The Masseurs themselves speak much less English but it didn't matter, I came for the massage and they are excellent at that and incredibly friendly and caring.Compared to other blind massage around Vietnam Omamori was actually a clean, calming and relaxing spa style centre which was nice. The price is more than other blind massage places we went to but still incredibly cheap at 170,000 VND. They don't accept tips but you can donate to the charity and each masseur gets paid a commission from the fee as well as the money being used to further train and care for more blind people. The centre workers donate their time and training for free very kindly.Go to this place for a great massage first and to support an amazing cause second, you wont have regrets."

The massage is done after you change into some loose clothing, I personally felt amazing. My feet felt lighter and I was less tense and sore..The rest of my family loved it too. Would definitely recommend the spa. It's got a great relaxing vibe and a chilled out group of staff who are accommodating and friendly. A definite recommendation and a great experience for my family.

I'd give it a 5Price was very reasonableClean facilityCons:1.I had a difficult time finding this spa located down an alley, off an alley with no signage. I stayed in Old Quarter (and it isn't close). I took a cab which cost me $5 USD over and $3 return, it was dark out, and the cab tried to leave me off early as he couldn't locate the place. I had him call and he was able to find the alley but it was strange walking down it alone in the dark, and I almost missed the place but one of the girls ran out and brought me in.2.Considering all the super reviews I felt a bit rushed upon arrival and departure. I was offered tea at both ends but then quickly escorted to massage room or front door. Dressing area is in the bathroom area which is unisex (hence one at a time and I wasn't sure if they were monitoring the door to keep others out while I used facilities). 3.Massage area is also unisex, and separated by curtains (see picture), but not at the end that people walk down, so as I was having my massage, a man was being led right by my massage in progress to the next table down).4. Lighting is dim, but conversation between masseuses and clients are audible to all.Would I return? I'm not sure. Despite a good massage and a good price, the cost of getting there, and lack of privacy might deter me."

Besides, you will hardly find cheaper for such a great time spent within their therapists hands.-All their therapists, although blinds, speak english pretty well.

The location was about a 20 minute cab ride, and the fare was 70,000 to 80,000 from the lake in the old quarter. The location was a little hard to find for our taxi driver- so note that the alley way is half way down the block."

There are only three types of massages, omamori, sweddish and stone. We took the omamori 95min for 250,000 dong. Totally enjoyed it. This price is less than half of what we paid in the Old Quarters (see my review on another spa in old quarters) and the massage was a lot better. We took bus 9 from the Old Quarter to Omamori, takes only 25-30minutes. Once you alight, cross the road and walk into a laneway beside a cafe. You can use google map to find the exact route the bus will take. It will help you know which stop to stop at."

We caught a cab the first time, then simply stepped outside and caught the No 9 bus back to the Old Quarter. The next day I was confident enough to catch the bus both to and from our hotel in the Old Quarter. The bus ride was easy, interesting and cheap, not to mention novelty value for the locals on the bus.Now to the massage - Omamori delivered the real deal - a genuine, expert and therapeutic massage. The masseuse asked if I preferred a strong massage, and then delivered it expertly. He knew exactly what areas needed attention and focused on those. Pure bliss, after having received some rather perfunctory massages at other establishments. I will visit Hanoi again and Omamori will be one of the reasons why. Yes, it was that good!On my second visit I had a lovely chat with one of the volunteers whilst I waited. I used the online booking system, and highly recommend this spa for its efficient, clean and friendly service and the most wonderful and well priced massage you could wish for."

I even changed my treatment's time and still the gave such a quick response. It is not hard for me to find this location, just look at alley 5 once you arrive at the address, walk and the first building on the right is Omamori Spa. They put a small blue sign at the front of the alley, makes it easier. The spa building is very small but very comfortable. Don't trust the pictures you see because the real one is beautiful. Yes, the privacy is lack here but I didn't have any problem at all with that, since the room is not bright. They set quite a cheap price here, and with that price you will get a VERY GOOD massage. I had one of the best massage in my life yesterday. This lady massaged me with techniques that I haven't had before. So relaxing and my body feel so light afterwards. I feel like I will come back again soon before I leave Hanoi. Such a great value. I left a donation for them at the end because I was very happy with their service and I wish many people will do the same thing since they don't accept any tip. :)"

She worked on my back for a good thirty minutes just as I had asked, then proceeded to use numerous relaxing, smooth hot stones that nearly put me to sleep. It's a somewhat small massage room, with 4 tables in one room divided by floor-to-ceiling curtains, but that did nothing to hinder the experience. It was very quiet, with calming sounds coming from the audio system as well as the comforting fragrance from the room's diffuser. All in all it was another great massage experience from a visually impaired therapist (which you would never know). Enjoy!!"

There was one other person having a massage on the bed next to me - so I can address the comment earlier about not having privacy. I felt that my masseuse ensured my privacy at all times by helping me cover up with towel/sheets. There were double curtains between the beds, so I actually could not tell if it was a man or a woman in there. The massage was great, from first touch to last! My masseuse was really attentative and professional. Over all a great experience!I would recommend it to anyone, except if you are really uncomfortable with the privacy part concerning the curtains in between the beds."

I took a half hour taxi ride there with a driver that did not speak English. He had a difficult time finding the place and just wanted to drop me off. I did not let him do that and he eventually brought me to the correct address. My massage therapist worked extremely hard! I had an 1-1/2 deep tissue massage and was sore for a few days after the massage. I get massages on a regular basis. Almost every single massage therapist quits working on my problem areas before the muscle has been released, but not my massage person at Omamori. I was very happy with the massage and am happy I took the taxi to this business. Not only was I supporting a good cause, I got an awesome massage. I was a little chilly however, because the therapist never put a sheet over me....just a little towel. Not sure why that happened. I was totally exposed, but what he heck, he was blind. If you are a modest person or like high-end spas, you may not like this spa. You are only separated from others getting massages by a curtain. But, it was a great massage at a very inexpensive price. Check it out!"

Positives : - Masseuse was attentive, amiable and polite- Nice ambience and massage in a quiet room- Support for a good cause- InexpensiveNegatives :- Do not expect much privacy here. Treatment room is open to both sexes, with each of the four massage beds only partially hidden from view by curtains (if you take up any of the first three beds in the room, expect to have both male and female customers walking pass/looking at you at any time). Same for shower/locker room - unisex shower cubicles with only a filmy curtain to offer you a wee bit of privacy - Difficult to locate spa location and NOBODY on the main street knows its location. A TA photo posted some time ago indicates that the alley is next to Queen Caf\u00e9. This shop signage has been changed and currently shows a Vietnamese name. If privacy does not matter so much to you and you're keen to try this spa, I would suggest that you focus on locating Alley no 5 (known locally as Ngo 5) first when you reach Huynh Thuc Khang St. Once you're in Alley no 5, you'll find the spa on your first right."

Came to the place you will feel relaxed by their fragrance oil all over the Spa and warmly welcome by the receptionist. She speaks a good English and very friendly, helpful. The guy who did the body massage for me was blind and can hear from one of his ear only but he was an brilliant masseur I've ever met. His service was exceptionally good. Thanks to the Winter promotion we only have to pay 160.000 VND ( US$8) for a 75\" body massage and no tips are allowed here. I felt really satisfy with their services and will definitely recommend it to all my friends and family."

I had my first foot massage, very interesting, and a back massage, while my husband had a full deep tissue Ormamori which really loosened up a few stiff joints. In addition to the massage it cost 85-95 VND for a taxi from the old quarter. Look at the photos and take careful note of the address for the taxi driver as it is a bit tricky to find. The address as we would lay it out is Alley 5, 102 Bl Huynh Thuc Khang Street. 102 is down a wide, open to the sun alley (alley number 5) next to 103. Take the first right down the alley and it's on the corner. Great, modern facilities, English spoken, and, no, the masseurs we had did not feel as they they were in training, they felt top notch.

            "review": "Good Cause to Massage!. Good quality massage by visually impared masseuse. High recommended. 1 hour feet massage & 75 mins body massage cost us only VND280,000 (US$13!). We also gave quite abit of donations on top of that as I really want to support such good cause. There is a no tipping policy in this place. Really enjoyed myself thoroughly here and would definitely urge massage lovers to visit this place!Tips on getting to this place as we had alot of difficult finding this place:1) Tell the taxi driver the abovementioned address: No.102 Huynh Thuc Khang Street, Dong Da 2) When you alight, you will see shop no. 102 is selling CDs. Omamori Spa shares the same address as it is behind this shop. No point asking the people there as they seem to be clueless that this place exists. 3) You will spot a black background sign \"Queen Cafe\". Walk down the alley on the left beside it and it will lead you to the Spa. Discerning eyes will spot the small tiny blue Omamori sign on the left side of the alley wall. (See my pictures for clearer explanation)"

And as a foreigner i LOVE the no tip policy - there is no one expecting you to give XX$, so you do not have to feel guilty about not tipping western style.Friendly attitude and good English speaking people.When you go down the Alley, do not feel you are in the wrong place - at the first intersection the place is right on your right hand."

The staff are very professional and no tipping is allowed. My husband and I had the 90minute vietnamise massage with hot stones and we agreed it was the best massage we have ever had and we have had many in many countries. The atmosphere is very quiet and calm no chattering by anyone. I have a problem with stiff neck and tense shoulders and tonight I feel like a new woman and my husband says he feels as if he has a new back. First time customers get a discount it cost us 300000dong all up.Thank you Omamori Spa and wish you good luck in your worthwhile venture."

This spa exclusively employees both men and women who are visually impaired. The location is easily found, the facility is clean and comfortable, and the therapist was extremely professional. It was the best massage I've ever had, so good I returned two more times while in Hanoi. Not only did I feel refreshed when leaving, but I felt good about supporting this business. The blind and visually impaired of Hanoi have a positive career track to follow. Point of interest: tipping is not expected or ALLOWED!"

Omamori Spa is run by Blind-Link (See Blind-Link Volunteerism), a non-profit that provides employment, support and training opportunities for the Vietnamese visually impaired community. My 60 minute massage was one of the best I've ever had, and I've had 100's over the years. The facility is tucked well away off a busy street so the studio environment is very quiet and relaxing. They offer several types of massage at prices that are very reasonable. I have to say that I felt like royalty while I was there. Both male and female visually impaired therapists are available. They have a place to change and shower as well. Don't miss stopping by for a 60, 75 or 90 minute treatment session when you're visiting Hanoi. You won't regret it!!"

Omamori Spa has a warm and inviting ambiance that begins with a hot cup of tea in a beautiful waiting area and courtyard. From there, I was given more information about the great non-profit and visually impaired massage therapists. They have a few different types of massages to choose from and the staff speak enough English to explain everything in detail. I had a one hour massage and the massage technique is wonderful! My therapist was really able to find my sore spots and work out all the kinks! It was much better than a generic massage and I didn't feel like she was just \"going through the routine\" as is at other spas. I would highly recommend getting a massage at Omamori Spa!!"

I had a 5-day visit in Vietnam, and 3 days of it in Hanoi...I arrived there very early in the morning after a very long day, with extreme back pain...most of the places were closed, until I eventually found OMAMORI SPA, where I received a lovely welcome, with hot Tea and a detailed explanation of their unique social non-profit enterprise that provides employment for the Blind community in Vietnam. The atmosphere in the spa is very relaxing, extremely clean and nicely designed. The massage was excellent! Definitely one of the most professional I've encountered. This was followed by another hot tea and a nice conversation with the Managers...All-in-All - an amazing experience on my first morning in Vietnam!"

It was close to our hotel in the Old Quarter and very easy to find. It was hard to believe how affordable the massage prices were (coming from USA where they can be pretty expensive) I got a great upper back/neck massage. It was so good, I decided to get a foot massage too.. very relaxing and therapeutic!! Hoan was my massage therapist- she is great at what she does!! Also very friendly and made sure I was comfortable and happy during the entire process. The spa itself was also very clean and nice atmosphere and loved the hot green tea after the massage.

The place is located in the old quarters. Inside is nice and clean but nothing special. We had made reservations beforehand but it still took a long time for them to get ready and organized. Once we had selected from the menu and decided on the scent of oil we were taken upstairs in two different rooms. The bed was nice and comfortable and the room temperature as well. The massage itself was horrible. Not attentive and without purpose and plan. The massesuse literally seemed like she could not care less about me and just wanted the 60 minutes to be over. A huge let down from high expectations!"

All I can say is that Thanh1 was just fantastic and she clearly knew what she was doing, stretching every sore and tired muscle in my body. This type of massage is not for the light hearted and I asked for firm and that's what I got for 70 minutes. I felt great when I left and sore back after sitting on a plane for a long time is feeling much better. I will return before heading home and highly recommend taking the time to go there as they offer a wide range of massages, they are very professional, kind and friendly staff.

Overall, the environment was really comfortable and soothing, unlike other massage shops in sapa. I've tried foot spa, warm stone foot massage & full body oil massage. Personally i think warm stone foot massage was the best! Thanks Bean for being such a friendly guy and attended to us real well. Kudos!!"

The spa's interior is beautiful with a lovely scent.The massage was exactly as described on the internet and really relaxing. The only negative thing were workers next to the building, so it was a little bit too noisey (this is only temporary). In the room it was a little bit cold.All in all it was a great experience I can really recommend, because you really get out of the traffic and all the noise for a couple of minutes. What you get is an excellent massage from friendly people."

My favourite one was the Indian deep back, shoulder and head massage, by Ms. Loan who worked magic on my back as I felt like I could fly after it. I can't thank her enough! My backache was gone in no time! I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and will be back to try other programs too. The variety of the latter is great too. Great place & great value!"

We visited this spa on our last day in Hanoi after a recommendation from hotel staff, and moments later a free taxi arrived to take us to the spa. Very friendly staff - we were told straight away that building work was being carried out next door and we could be taken to their sister spa if we wished. We opted to stay put. For approx \u00a350 each we received 5 hours of pampering. A steam bath, followed by Indian massage, hot stone massage, salt skin rub, moisturising and a relaxing facial. Afterwards - a meal was ready for us to enjoy before leaving.Note - there are a lot of stairs involved! I have very creaky knees and hips and the multiple flights of stairs to get to room may be a problem for some. Also - be warned - the paper pants provided are mighty small, be prepared for hilarity and mortification, and perhaps take your own if anything over a size 12 :)"

Definitely try it out if you rarely get massages or if you need some vacation time to spare in the area. You surely won't be negatively affected.

We booked the Mido Special massage for 90 minutes both times in a private room. Few notes: Make sure you request the private room.**This not one of these massages that is meant to put you too sleep with light touches. You will be stretched and thoroughly massaged. Any aching muscle will be completely fixed when you leave. Both therapists asked numerous times about the pressure but they were always right on. It's like they have a sixth sense for areas that are more tense and need deeper pressure and areas that were sore would get lighter pressure.Absolutely Phenomenal! Thank you!"

We decided to go a bit more unconventional than the normal foot and hand massage and opted for a foot scrub. Nguyet (my masseuse) was absolutely wonderful, she was very thorough with every part of the massage and I had an amazing 75 minutes. Couldn't have asked for better service by the rest of the staff as well. We'll be back (tomorrow)!"

An amazing respite and thoroughly deserving reward after a long day's worth of walking and exploring Hanoi. The masseuse Hoan was very friendly, consistently aware if the foot massage was painful at certain points. I never expect a massage to be completely pain free, after all, no pain no gain! But what was impressive was that Hoan was very aware if I even twitched slightly, asking if a certain massage was too painful or not. Truly great service! Extremely comfortable, felt like I had a new set of feet by the end of it. Even provided refreshing drinks before and after the massage! Each 60 minute foot massage is 290 VND, and 400 VND for a 75 minute foot spa that includes a scraping of the feet plus scrub, which has certainly left my feet smooth as ever. Would strongly recommend this massage place for anyone looking to treat themselves to an hour of amazing relaxation after a long day walking around humid Hanoi!"

I opted for a traditional Thai massage (one of my favourites) and came out as a new man.I am not sure why some people would give this place less than 4 or 5 stars. The staff was quite professional and friendly. Of course, there is a bit of a language barrier as only a few people speak English, but that will definitely not change the experience at all!The price also seemed to be quite reasonable given the great atmosphere and cleanliness.I would definitely recommend this SPA!I really look forward to come back to Mido after my Trekking in SAPA!"

However, the one negative experience I got out of this was that the staff were constantly gossiping about my girlfriend and me. We are both fluent in Vietnamese and were fully aware of what they were saying. Being a masseuse and constantly working with different bodies one would expect them to be professional, but throughout the massage (despite it being good) they were constantly talking to each other calling me fat and unfit. This made me very uncomfortable and will result in me probably never going back to this spa again, I highly recommend fixing the issue, because otherwise was great service."

The room is very clean and huge. I have had several similar massage before but this one beats them all! Thanks to you, Tuat for an excellent job well done! The only \"complaint\" is that I had to climb up 3 or 4 floors to get to the massage room. I will definitely come back again on my next trip to Hanoi. Highly recommended."

            "review": "Please don't get your eyebrows waxed here.... I really wanted to like this place because the people are very sweet. The minute I walked inside, I was greeted by a young man and shown a menu. As I sat looking over the menu, a young woman brought me some lukewarm tea *not sure if it was meant to be at this temperature but whatever*. I decided on an eyebrow wax *the reason I came* and a swedish massage because with their prices... how could you not?Well..first, do NOT expect luxury from this place. This is not one of those hidden gems where you wonder how they afford to keep their treatments at such a low cost... you pay for what you get here. It is cheap and it feels cheap. I was brought upstairs to the 3rd and entered a large room with 6 or so massage tables. I was told to go to the furthest table which was closest to the opposite wall and right under the air conditioning. There is no barrier to each bed except for a curtain *a bit like in hospitals*. The two young girls asked me to undress which I did.. it was a bit uncomfortable because they didn't close the curtain and I ended up undressing partially in front of them which was a bit weird. Anyway, first, they \"waxed\" my brows. The wax was WAY too hot, I think the girls knew this was an issue because she kept blowing on it as she applied it to my skin and kept asking \"it's ok?\".. hey, I'm young and have experienced worse pain but it was very uncomfortable to say the least. Not ideal, especially when they got to the sensitive thin skin around the eyes. They *yes, two of them* finished my brows and immediately started my massage, odd. Usually, you're given a mirror to see the results but whatever, I'm in Vietnam so I'm gonna go with it. The massage was legitimately the WORST massage I've ever received. It felt like she was rubbing sunblock on my back more than massaging my muscles. They were very abrupt and choppy strokes. It got to the point where I was almost going to just ask her to kindly stop, I'd pay for the treatment but I didn't want it. However, all of a sudden, the massage got good. As the masseuse got closer to my shoulders, I noticed she now wore slippers and had an ankle bracelet. I'm pretty sure one woman started my massage and another women finished which again, is fine.. but odd. Then, it was time for me to turn over and that's when I realized the lights were on, not dimmed at all. So she put a towel over my eyes and told me \"goodnight\". That's when someone turned the air conditioning on full blast as it hit my oiled bare legs, so cold! At the end of my treatment, she told me I could get dressed but I still hadn't seen my eyebrows so I asked for a mirror. They spoke and giggled to each other then gave me one girl's phone and put it on camera but there was a weird green filter on.. I told them never mind and that I'd look on my phone. I realized looking on a camera phone is not the same so asked again if I could please look at a mirror. Finally, they gave me one and I see why they didn't want to. My eyebrows are jacked up! I'm not a vain person but wow-ee. I've never received a worse eyebrow wax. She shortened my eyebrows on both sides, and somehow gave them less shape. So they kind of look like two frownie faces. My eyebrows had grown out so she had a lot to work with. Upon closer inspection, she missed A LOT of strays, and had even taken some hair out so it looked patchy. She asked if I was \"okay\" and I told her \"not really\" as I explained what I was unhappy with. She went away for a second so I started to dress when the woman at reception walked in as I covered myself with my shirt, still in nothing but underwear. She asked me what was wrong and tried to convince me they looked good. She kept asking if I was happy so I finally gave her a \"Yes, fine\" so I could get dressed. As I checked out, she gave me a questionnaire on my visit and I filled it out honestly, saying I felt \"average\" about the visit. When it was time to pay she told me she took off my eyebrows which was very kind of her. I still gave my masseuse a tip because I feel weird not to but will definitely not be coming back. Also, please, seriously, do NOT get your eyebrows done here. it's 100k dong which is one hell of a deal but you're seriously going to get what you're paying for. Oh, not to mention, my first red flag should have been that the woman waxing my brows was the woman who gave me the massage. I feel awful leaving a bad review because they really do seem to be nice people there but I'm rating them on their work."

There were curtains drawn as partitions and luckily we were allocated at the far end of the room. Me and my husband had their Mido special massage (3-in-1), but we can't really tell the difference between the different massages. It is still very relaxing and I even fell asleep. I thought it was slightly over-priced, especially after visiting Midori Spa a few days later. Apparently, they seem to share the same group of masseurs as I saw the same masseurs from Mido when we visited Midori spa (which charge at a much lower price)."

And He came away trying to convince me that I should get one! Unfortunately, when we arrived back at our hotel later that day we discovered that one of the hot stones has burnt His back. It has blistered and left quite a significant burn mark. We would have loved to have given the spa a 5/5, but the burn shouldnt have happened and has left a sour taste in our mouths. So get a pedicure, but maybe skip the hot stone massage."

Having arrived in Hanoi very early in the morning and extremely tired from the uncomfortable trip by train from Sapa we (my husband and 25 year old son) decided that a full massage in a spa would revive us while waiting to check in in our Hotel.We found Mido Spa on trip advisor and due to the excellent overall rating we walked in. The reception was very good, we were welcomed with a very refreshing tea while waiting for the masseurs to arrive.We were taken to a room with three beds separated by a curtain. The room was not at all attractive but it does not matter when your eyes are supposed to be closed.We started with a sauna, the three of us were asked to go and seat in a cramped shower inside a toilet where we were blasted with unbearably hot steam. I have never had a sauna before but I was not expecting it to be so uncomfortable, I had to leave before the end. The sauna was then followed by a full massage which included a full facial. The massage was pleasant but the girls never stopped talking to each other in their own language and I found this very annoying especially when you are trying to relax.The facial came last but turned out to be a disaster, they used a towel to rub, and rub and rub energetically around my eyes and a strong suction pump to clean the pores. At the end of the 2 hour session we dressed up and went back to reception were we given a meal treat and a souvenir gift.When we finally checked in at the hotel I looked at the mirror and realized I was bruised around the eyes and on the nose. The red bruises lasted for more than one month and I am not sure if they were due to the suction machine they used to clean the pores or the pressure of the rubbing with the towels or even an allergy to some substance they had used to lubricate the skin or the bleach used to wash the towels. All I can say is that it has been very uncomfortable for the whole duration of the trip and only now, a month later, it seems to have settled. I do not want to discourage people from having a facial at the Mido Spa but I feel it is right to share my experience."

This year it was new that I could choose within a wide variety of oils for the massage. As in the years before I liked the clean and spacious massage rooms and I appreciated the possibility to take a shower in an also spacious and clean shower room. Again I received the massage from Thanh 1 (Thanh Ninh). She is able to adapt her massage style perfectly to my needs. Of course her polite, friendly and warm personality should also be mentioned.

I walked in without a reservation and requested a 75 minute session. The reception staff were hospitable, offered me tea and a treatment within 5 minutes. Fantastic I thought! I had however witness the couple who stepped inside before me get told that there was no manicure services available for the lady & the the guy was going to have to share a room with me! The wife was not impressed and said that they would go elsewhere. As it turns out, there are about 5 beds per room and I was lucky to be on the end with the curtain closed. I initially wanted a herbal steam bath or jacuzzi that was offered on the menu to be told it was not available. Seems a few services on their extensive menu were not available.Now for the massage, it was anything but a sports massage. After 5 minutes I spoke to the lady who got her supervisor to help clarify the situation. Clearly the lady didn't know what a sports massage was and there for in my opinion shouldn't have been given the task. Her technique slightly improved after that however she finished the session 15 minutes early. I expressed my disappointment to the reception staff who were very apologetic, charging me only for one hour with an additional 20% off. This I thought was fair. So as my title reads, this place was not what I expected. It's a shame as there have been many who did enjoy there experience, maybe I was just unlucky on this occasion. The receptionist offered me a further discount for me to come back so I may let them redeem themselves later this week."

            "review": "Poor Professionalism and Lacking in Atmosphere. First, I\u2019ll state a big caveat that we walked out of this spa, so I can\u2019t speak to any of the treatments here. We had booked 90 minutes each for 5 PM on a weekday, and arrived early (around 4:40 PM) to see if we start our services earlier. The place was already packed and tons of shoes were lined outside the entrance (as it\u2019s typical to go barefoot once inside a spa in Hanoi). After some confusion, the host understood that we weren\u2019t trying to book a new appointment but already had an existing one (this did require some time though). She let us know we should return at 5 PM; no problem, we walked around the neighborhood and returned at 5 PM.This time, we were ushered to a seating area on a couch beneath the stairs since the front waiting area was packed. I think we must\u2019ve been in the employee break area since we faced the employee lockers and were near their communal kitchen. We were given tea, and I asked to use the restroom, and was shown the way. While clean, I was not impressed with the restroom, which was functional but a bit unkempt, and not spa-like. Walking back out, I noticed the lavender colored walls and bright lights in the spa. I couldn\u2019t help but think about SF Spa (that we had visited just days before and were unable to book) with its soothing, peaceful ambience, and where the person who greets you immediately comes to take your shoes away and provide you with flip flops.At 5:05, the host came out and told us that she would need 15 more minutes because the person before had done a package and they needed time to clean the room. As we were tight on schedule, we declined to stay, and let her know we\u2019d be leaving. On the way out, she asked if we wouldn\u2019t reconsider if she could get us in a shared room straight away. While she was polite and gracious throughout, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that the level of professionalism here was lacking. And certainly, the ambience in the waiting area left much to be desired. I\u2019d definitely check out SF Spa Hanoi Corner (haven\u2019t been to the one by the lake) over Mido if you\u2019re staying in the Old Quarter."

Their massage service is okay, with friendly staff however, a little too casual for my liking. I personally would prefer a more professional approach.The rooms I was in has 3 beds and they don't separate according to sexes. They wanted to arrange me and my female friends to be in the same room even though we were going to be stripped down to our undergarments! In the end me and my other male friend got our own room with 1 shower and they expected us to shower together after our body scrub! They even wanted to stay in the room while we were changing out which felt kind of weird, so we asked them to leave first. Not sure if they were blur or this is their normal practice.I wouldn't go back again as the whole visit felt abit too unprofessional."

The costs were a little pricey but based on the reviews we were happy to give Mido Spa a go. We had a nice (and routine) welcome including a tea. After making our selection we were led to our treatment room and that's where it started to go downhill. My massage was okay but there were points where the lady was on her phone (standard for a cheap massage but not what I expected). We also think she was talking to the other masseuse about how to give his massage. My wife chose an aromatherapy massage. Firstly the masseuse giving her massage was the same one we experienced a few days earlier (at a different spa) and we didn't go back there based on his massage there. We suspect he may be a trainee, which is fine and we understand that you need to learn on the job (maybe just don't charge the same price). The masseuse then proceeded to urinate (loudly) in the adjoined to our treatment room - not great. He was then very poor in his massage (sounds similar to my experience of him previously where he sniffled a lot during the massage). There was very little oil used despite it being an aromatherapy oil massage. It was just a poor massage.To finish off the experience, they just reset the bedding ready for the next customer rather than get fresh bedding (my wife did comment that her towels smelt bad). All in all a disappointing experience. The front of house staff were faultless but we would not recommend."

There is no hurried atmosphere at all, and the masseuses are nice and friendly. They speak almost no English though, so be ready to communicate with gestures.

When i arrived, I received a cup of tea and was then led up to the 4th floor into a room (looked like a room made for couples). Room was a nice temperature. After the massage, I was led back down to the waiting area and given a cup of fresh lemon juice. This spa's services are a little bit more pricey compared to other spas in the area, however, it was a really great massage and overall worth it. The only thing was the matter of privacy when undressing/dressing - they ask you to undress but don't leave the room. This was the same at the other spa I went to in Hanoi."

They offered tea when we came in and lemon juice after the massage. We had a foot massage, Thai massage, and a mix of different types of massages. Very pleased with the results ! We laid down next to each other in a peaceful room. Perfume and music were also very relaxing.We had the last massages before going back to the airport and the boss offered to take us to the bus station after the massage. What he did. It was 9 pm and the bus service was off so he took us to the airport !!! He refused the money we gave him... Never seen such a selfless behaviour !I definitely recommend this spa !Carole & Jean from France."

I get the Swedish massage, because I need a lighter touch, yet improved circulation (they offer many different kinds of massages, at anywhere from and hour to two hours) and was both times very pleased with the result. The first time I had a man and the second a woman; both were very competent, pleasant and quiet during the massage. I like the music they use (very soft and Copland-esque) and the rooms have been clean both times. The person at the front desk (different each time) was pleasant and efficient, and always gives customers tea upon arrival and lemon juice afterward. All in all, a very relaxing ninety minutes. I've been to many massage parlors in Vietnam, and have had a large range of experiences. This one has been the best. AND, they take plastic!"

She was saying 'I'm very small but very strong' as she was standing on my back! The massage was so good I decided to come back on my last day just before my flight home. I decided to get the same shiatsu massage, and Thang also greeted me welcoming me back. But I got another therapist, who sadly did not do a strong massage like Thang and I had to keep asking her to go stronger. She realised this and was sorry so even offered me a discount because I wasn't entirely satisfied. I would still come back if I ever come back to Hanoi!"

The only element I didn't like about my foot massage was it being interrupted by another customer wanting to do nail polish. The foot massage room was dimmed and ambience was soothing when I entered. After 15 min, the lights were switched on to normal white lights to serve the other customer. It disrupted my rest as 1 person was having her nail polish done while her friend was continuously talking to her. I didn't like the smell of the nail polish as well. I thought they should have used a smaller portable light which I saw in other spa to not disturb the massage customers."

I emailed them and they got back to me very quickly - I asked for a discount because of the amount of treatments I was having and they offered me 20%.

That was an experience in itself lol it wasn't the first time I'd been on a scooter in Vietnam, but don't expect a car if you are using the free pick up service! I was greeted by the manager, sweets and drinks were given and then I was introduced to Dinky - my lady for the day! She was absolutely lovely and spoke very good English like most of the staff. I had a Swedish body massage, deep facial, foot paraffin treatment and a pedicure and colour. I'm very happy to say that every treatment was amazing, and the nail varnish was OPI!! :) I spent 4 hours in the spa and it came to \u00a330... Easily my best bargain of my travels so far!

Duan for Shiatsu massage would be hard to beat and Mi was super for Swedish massage. We were very lucky to meet Thanh2 and Ting on the other occasions. Even after moving on to Danang and trying other highly regarded massage spas, Thanh2's hot stone massages were absolutely the best and I have been inspired to look in to massage courses when I get home. Ting's Swedish massage for my husband was great and even better the next time as she was able to adjust the style to a stronger version when requested. Both girls were a lot of fun and my husband and I were in the same room for our treatments. There are a number of stairs to climb to get to some of the rooms which might be difficult for some people.

So, given the quality of the massages, perhaps we have been spoiled. First, we went to Mido Spa because of it's high rating here. Tucked away on a hectic street in the Old Quarter, the facility is very nicely appointed. Each massage room is on a different floor, so we had to walk up a few flights of stairs, but it got us ready for our massages. Our masseuses were very sweet and very friendly. However, I only gave Mido 3 stars because despite the facility and the sweet masseuses, ultimately, we were there for high quality massages. Unfortunately, although there is no really bad massage, our massages were just OK, nice but nothing great. The girls did not seem to have actual training as masseuses and were unable to give the deep pressure that my wife likes. Don't get me wrong -- we had a good time and enjoyed ourselves. It's just that with the massages that we have had in Saigon, we expected more. Perhaps we are spoiled by our other experiences and Ha Noi has a different standard than Saigon.

Second, before the massage starts, they used room temperature water to wash our legs (usually spas use warm water!). Third, we weren't offer a robe to wear, it was simply strip and lie down. Fourth, no lockers. We did a massage at another spa which is 25min away from Old Quarter by bus. The visually impacted masseurs over there did a way better job and less than half of what we paid at Mido. If time is not at your side, you can settle for Mido.

As with all massages be sure you communicate with your massage therapist as to your preferences for the room temperature, pressure of the massage, areas of pain to give more attention to and areas you wish to avoid (such as an arthritic joint, etc.) That way you are sure to have a perfect massage.

My friend and I then decided to have a massage later that day as it had been raining all day and we had limited options in what to do. We had an Indian neck, shoulder and back massage. It was one of the best massages I've had in a while. Gentle and relaxing. The girls were so lovely to us. Felt very comfortable with them. Will be back to visit again this Saturday! See you soon midi spa!"

The steam bath turned out to be a shower compartment within a bathroom. Interesting but space efficient, in any case we liked it. The massages were good and my facial left my skin in a wonderful plumb state, although smelling of Aloe Vera which i am not keen on. We were offered food but had just had dinner previously so they insisted on giving us a little souvenir which was very sweet. All in all enjoyed it. They kindly offered a free ride from our hotel to the spa which they paid for. We noticed our taxi driver was taking us for a ride when he circled the street twice but they paid for the fare without a blink. Thank you again for a wonderful relaxing evening."

The staff were friendly and could all speak very good english. I had the basic facial which was far from basic. It included a cleanse, a scrub, a deep pore cleanse, arm, hand, scalp and back massage. My only gripe was that my beautician kept sniffing like she had a cold. My partner got a pedicure and wasn't very pleased with it due to not having a thorough scrub done meaning there was excess amounts of dry skin left on her feet. I would have scored Mido a 5/5 had my beautician not obviously been sick and if my partner had got what she had paid for"

As our hotel booked this spa as the trip adviser's rate was high enough, I even decided to pay 10% more for the tet holiday rate. The first day we three got foot massage, it was nice so far especially the guy with white hair, mom said his massage skill was great. When we come back from Halong bay we booked this mido spa again for our last massage in Hanoi, this was my MISTAKE. The manager made us wait for 20 mins first then said the massagers are eating dinner and they will get ready soon in 5mins. So we were waiting another 20 mins. I booked at 9 pm and it was almost 10pm and we were totally tired. I asked the manager that we don't want to get 2hours massage anymore bc it's too late, if you can do massage now we just get that for 1 hour, if not we just leave now. She was saying just \"okay\" for an hour even though she didn't understand at all.It seemed that the massager's were ready. It was my 2nd MISTAKE that I didn't leave that shop at that time. The three new massagers didn't know how to massage!! They just made us painful! I'm sure the manager made a call to the other spa(???) that she can bring ANY person available at that time. It was horrible and I felt so sorry for my parents. Don't go here not to spoil your holiday."

On both visits I chose 2 hours aromatherapy massage, a perfect relax after long walks through Hanoi.

She is also very friendly and polite, always with a nice smile. Since last year she has improved her English skills noticably.

The spa had recently been re-decorated and we were warmly welcomed with a drink before our relaxing massage which lasted about an hour. Pleasant surroundings and staff amenable. No idea of price as was 'free' for us. Will visit again if in Hanoi."

However during my trip to Ha Long bay I got very badly sun burnt despite wearing sunscreen the whole time. A day later my skin went very bad, dry and sore and I broke out with infected black heads. It looked and felt horrible. Back in Hanoi was 8pm and my skin hurt so much I needed something on it, I was very tired so I walked into the first spa I saw. The place smelt amazing, Immediately I was invited to take off my shoes, negotiate what I wanted (natural skin care facial) 60 minutes for 400K. They gave me a cup of sweet tea. The therapist I had was very lovely and made me feel immediately comfortable. I locked my valuables in a safe with the key of my wrist and lay down. I then had my face washed, cream massaged into it, my pores opened up with steam and gunk sucked up in a weird little face vacuum, she then gave me an amazing face cream massage. At this point I was blissed out. The skin on my face had been hurting so badly for two days and it already felt better. Just as I was thinking it was finished, she placed a tissue over my face and then brushed cool a natural mushy banana avocado mask onto my face. It was heaven. While the mask set she gave me a small neck and hand message. When the facial was finished I felt so calm and my skin was like new, clean and glowing. Very happy with the experience."

They had me take a seat while I looked through their spa offerings drinking a cup of the free tea they had given me. They then gave me a tour of the facility, which was excellent. I opted for the hot stone massage and it was a very excellent experience. I feel relaxed and will definitely return if I am ever back in Hanoi. "

We negotiated a good price for both of us and were brought pho half-way through the afternoon. Our treatment room was several floors up and was clean, cool and nicely decorated. The body scrub and massage were very good and when I requested firmer pressure for the massage it was delivered. The only problem we encountered was with my facial. I ended up with a dark purple mark on the tip of my nose which lasted several days. I wasn't terribly upset about it, but was disappointed there was no apology for whatever error was made during the service. My husband had no issues, and I have no doubt it was a simple mistake.I would return to this spa on another visit to Hanoi."

Also, noodle soup lunch was included, and some extra free spring rolls because of the christmas holidays. The steam bath seemed a little homemade, but other than that it was a really nice experience. The massage was good, the scrub was good and same with the facial. We got to be treated in the same room as well, which I appreciate.

The price was definitely not THAT affordable but given the fact it was centrally located and the experience was great I'd say it was worth it. We went in for a couples massage with hot stone for him and aromatherapy for myself. The lady who greeted us at the door was extremely friendly, and the man at the end was so nice he was offering us a small traditional meal with spring rolls as a special Christmas gift after we were done. We would have stayed to enjoy the food if we hadn't had to leave right away to catch the flight. I've had cheaper massage with the same or even better quality in Thailand but the people here were so nice I could not not write a thumbs up review for them. Overall we enjoyed it a lot and would recommend our friends to come check it out when they come visit Hanoi. The place was definitely a little charm in the Old Quarter."

We stumbled upon Mido Spa back in May 2014. It's centrally located in the heart of the Old Quarter. There we enjoyed a relaxing Swedish massage, facials and pedicures. Although, it wouldn't hurt if they had more nail polish selections. Mido Spa is open, bright and clean, which are important features we always look for in any spas. At the end of our appointment, we met with the spa manager who was very pleasant and even gave us directions to a good Banh Mi store. We came back to Hanoi in October and decided to walk to Mido Spa to say hello. The manager approached us at the door and immediately remembered us. We were surprised. He even recalled our love for Banh Mi sandwiches. Because we were strapped for time in Hanoi, the manager allowed me to shorten the length of my hot stone massage to an hour and at a better price. I remember it was pouring rain after we were done. A free poncho from the spa did the trick. The staff are all very friendly and if I were back in Hanoi for a third time, I would come again!"

Although I could still hear the buzz of nearby construction tools, the atmosphere still remained relaxed and peaceful for the 60 minutes. I even fell asleep during a large part of it. My face was hand rubbed with many different fragrant gels. At one point a machine that emitted very hot vapor was held over my face while the lady did smoothing maneuvers with some kind of tools all over my face. After the rubs and hot vapor, a mask was put on and I fell asleep. When she entered the room again I woke up and she took off the mask and did a final rubbing scrub. She sat me up and did a quick back massage. I'm writing this review in the spa waiting room right now literally 10 minutes after finishing, so I don't know what effects there are on my skin yet, but it feels a bit sticky ( it's the lotion?)Dunno if I would do again.

The masseuse certainly knew what she was doing - I dosed off for 20 minutes or so during it! I only booked the 60 min massage but would definitely go for the longer option next time."

My wife and I have just returned from a session at Mido spa, I had the 60 minute body massage which was great, very relaxing and just strong enough.My wife had the foot spa and massage which was good however people were going in and out of the room having other treatments which she found to be a distraction so ask for private room if possible."

The lady got all the stress and tension out in my back leaving me feeling rejuvenated. I also had a mini facial leaving my face feeling really cleansed and glowing. My partner had an hour aromatherapy massage and has also come away feeling relaxed and happy with the experience. The place is reasonably priced, very clean and the staff are professional in making sure you are comfortable and happy. If we weren't leaving Hanoi tomorrow I would definitely go back to Mido Spa. Thank You :-)"

I went for a 75 minute Thai massage and it was EXCELLENT. It was nice to find a place that offers strong massages as the ones in Hanoi aren't typically as so. It was a bit more than some places (520k) but I was very pleased. They also have a \"happy hour\" going on from now till November if you spend a certain amount of money. Ask in person or check the website. I'll definitely be back."

The facilities are clean, cool and comfortable. The spa pedi lasts just over an hour, starting of with an amazing foot scrub, followed by a foot massage and then the pedicure. The reason I gave it 4 of out 5 is the actual massage wasnt the best I've ever had, but it could just be that masseuse... Still I will definitely be going back."

It was my friend\u2019s birthday, so a few of us decided to get oil massages together at Mido.The massages were fantastic. The ladies giving us massages were very professional throughout the session. Rather than giving a standard rub, they customized our massages and paid extra attention to our troubled spots (for me it was my shoulders). We had been to some not-so-great massage places in other cities, and overall we really enjoyed our experience at Mido.The icing on the cake was that there was an actual cake! We filled out some informational forms, and my friend mentioned it was her birthday. When we were done with our massages, the owner and the staff ushered us to the lobby and brought out a surprise birthday cake, lychees, and Saigon beer!! As a personal touch, her name was even on the cake! They invited the other patrons to come and we all sang happy birthday together. The Mido staff went the extra mile to make my friend\u2019s birthday special. It was incredibly nice of them and showed a high level of attention to detail. I would highly recommend Mido Spa, both for their excellent massages and customer service."

And the lady actually threw in free nail painting(not the manicure suite) and discounted the entiret treatment to 350,000doung per person. We were like wow,bcoz we didn't even asked for a discount. They also tried to make our waiting more enjoyable by providing nice sweet mangos and tea for us. During our treatment,the 3 service staff were very friendly and chatted with us,sharing with us some common Vietnamese terms,their lifestyle,and we also answered some of their questions abt our country. It was like talking to new found friends. Overall we had a pleasant experience even though the treatment wasn't the best of the class,it was the service that wowed us.

I got their brochure from the hotel I was staying in and thought their prices were reasonable. I was welcome by friendly staff and offered some tea. They'll give you beer if you prefer that. Since it was in the middle of the day I got to have the common room to myself. I got the Swedish massage and the masseur was really good, I dozed off a little bit. I added a 30-minute foot massage for a small price and that was well worth it. I left Mido feeling relaxed and rejuvenated. Highly recommend it."

A Mido Spa's staff opened the door, smiled n said Hello wt me n then invited me come-in. She showed me the massage list n I chose the 60m foot-massage. I felt very very enjoyed with her experience n I asked her about the body-massage! Woaaa! It's so lovely n I felt really happy with that! I talked with my Aussie brother-inlaw n he took my sister to Mido. They said They was be really happy with the experience massage, the friendly staff with their smile n the customer service.

Having had cheap massages in a few places in Vietnam, whilst mido spa was very slightly more expensive, the difference in price was more than made up for by the difference in quality, ambience and professionalism of staff. So much so, we even went back for more during a brief stop over in Hanoi another time!The staff were very friendly and welcoming, and the environment was very relaxing and much more like what you would expect from a spa. On both occasions we got our treatments straight away with no need to book, and the second time even got a discount for returning! This made the total cost of 2 full body 60 minute thai massages less than $20!The massages themselves were very relaxing and a high quality compared to some we experienced elsewhere. Certainly comparable to a decent spa in the UK.WIsh we'd had more time in Hanoi as we would certainly have gone back once more. Rebecca and Ally"

We walked past Mido Spa and it looked really nice with affordable prices. When we went inside the people were very polite. We asked for two types of treatments and they made a reasonable price for us. The staff is really nice and speaks good English. We ended up spending almost three hours in the salon. But we had a great time. They did however reused some towels, which isn't really hygienic. And we bought a treatment with masks for our hands and feet. We had to put our hands and feet in hot wax. After it dried they pulled the dried up wax from our hands and feet and put the wax back in the same pot. I hope they don't use the same pot of wax for other costumers, but I'm afraid they do. Anyways, the trearment was nice and the staff was very polite. I would recommend going here for a massage or getting your nails done. It's a reasonable price."

My boyfriend and I came here on Jan 30, admittedly vietnamese NYE and TET holiday - and in the beginning we were willing to cut a bit of slack for this. My boyfriend asked for a 90min sports massage and I had a 30min sea salt scrub and 60 min aromatherapy massage. There was no instruction to get undressed and zero professionalism - we got undressed and piled our clothes in the corner of the room while the staff watched. The ladies talked to each other throughout the massage. The lady massaging my boyfriend answered her mobile phone twice which was resting on the massage table near his head. We heard customers downstairs and owing to TET holiday there was no receptionist, so the lady massaging me ran downstairs to serve them. She came back and left again for at least 10 minutes. Then she returned, spoke to the other lady and left AGAIN. At which point the woman massaging my boyfriend stopped and starting massaging me. Then she swapped back and a third girl began to massage my legs. At this point I had had the same leg massaged for about 25mins of my 60 min massage. To say it was a massage is a stretch of the word - she rubbed up and down my leg applying oil but zero pressure. When they realised there were more customers coming - the girl massaged each of my arms for about 1 minute and my another lady came to massage my head. I cannot express what a shambles of a massage this was. No symmetry in the techniques, three different staff and completely uneven in terms of time spent on each limb. To make matters worse, as we were redressing my boyfriends masseuse started asking us for a \"tip,tip\". It took us a while to work out what she was saying and when we finally did we were shocked. The massage were so unprofessional and interrupted we thought they would be more likely to offer us a discount. Shocked - my boyfriend offered 50,000 vnd to which she said \"100 please\". The second lady (my masseuse) then rushed in the door to ask me for a tip.. I was livid. I handed her 50,000 vnd but she kept asking for me more to which I refused. We were literally cornered by the two ladies in the room who kept asking for more money- all before we had even gone to reception to pay. Whilst tips are not customary in Vietnam, we would certainly have tipped had it of been our CHOICE to thank the staff for a nice experience. The massages were not cheap - this is not a cheap spa - and for the prices they are asking we expected a professional, calm and relaxing experience. When we left we were shaken and appalled at the behaviour of the staff. They would not let us leave the room without us tipping them both. I do NOT recommend this spa in any way. The claim to offer \"swedish, thai, aromatherapy and sports\" massage styles but what we experienced was not a massage in any way. It was more a thorough application of oil and rubbing of the skin. The ladies were aggressive requesting tips and we did not have a choice but to hand over the money. Terrible, terrible experience. For the same amount of money visit SF Spa."

I liked the clean ambience and the friendly atmosphere. During both visits I took the aroma massage. I was in 2 different massage rooms and each of the 2 rooms was spacious, clean and comfortable, provided with a clean shower room. Most of all I enjoyed the massage by Thanh, who gave me the massage during both visits. She is a very nice and friendly girl, polite, caring and with very good skills for the massage. At the beginning she asked if I prefer the massage strong or soft and during the massage she asked from time to time: \"Are you ok?\" The only honest answer I could give was \"Yes, I am!\". I appreciate this kind of behaviour very much and it is symbolic for the entire spa. True wellness is provided here!"

While we were waiting for our therapists, they ushered a gentleman into our room to use the toilet which was about 2m away from us in a little room. Nice. Then after a perfunctory foot buff and some very quick rubbing with a scrub the girl put cuticle cream onto my nails. After this she did the usual and THEN removed my old nail polish. Honestly - I was planning the next pedicure to do the job properly as I was sitting in the salon. My daughter was giving me the thumbs down while we were there. The whole time the girls chatted to each other loudly in Vietnamese with various other staff wandering in and out for a chat. Then my nails were cut with a clipper and were a bit rough and so I had to ask for her to smooth off with a quick filing. Honestly, for $15 each or 300,000 VND each, I would have expected a lot better. This took about 40 minutes and I would go back next time to SF Spa which was a lot more professional and around the same prices."

During my session, the masseur would calibrate the pressure at which she pressed at different pressure points to ensure maximum effect without significant discomfort. In addition, the masseurs do speak good English and are able to comprehend requests for advanced massage techniques.The Spa also offered to provide me with a free one way taxi either from (my Hotel in the Hanoi Old Quarter to Vispa) or from (Vispa to my hotel in Hanoi Old Quarter). This offer was a big plus for me, as it made travelling to my hotel after my massage session all the more convenient and relaxing.This place is a full-fledged Spa that offers Facial care, Foot & Hand care and Body Massages at reasonable rates. Given the positive experience, I will most certainly return to this spa to try the other facial, foot and hand care services Vi Spa provides."

Google map will direct you to this closed location so make sure to go to No7 Hang Buom Str, Hang Buom Dist, Ha Noi or use their complimentary one-way taxi service to not get lost (which is what happened to us).Pros:* Spacious and clean spa right in the Old Quarter.* They pay for one-way taxi ride to the spa, just coordinate with your hotel. * Hard-to-beat prices: 90 min synergy massage for ~$28.92 USD, 30 min head/neck/shoulder massage for ~$11.13 USD, 60 min facial starting at ~ $17.80 USD, and basic mani-pedi for $8.90 USD. All services and prices you can find on http://vispa.vn/.* I loved and highly recommend Thum. Her head/neck/shoulder massage was phenomenal and I basically melted by the end of the session. Her strokes were deliberate, methodical, and soothing. She gave just the right amount of pressure without it hurting. I am not a fan of repetitive motions using the elbow and arms, and Thum mostly used her hands and fingers which I liked. She also gives an excellent facial. I\u2019ve had a lot of massages and facials before, and Thum definitely knows what she\u2019s doing. * Staff here is so friendly, professional, and warm. When we came back a second time, I was not happy with my massage (just not digging the technique) and asked for a new person, they waived my unsatisfactory massage. Cons:* Not sure if you can request a certain masseuse, I loved Thum so much I asked to have her again upon my 2nd visit, but they said she wasn\u2019t working that day. And when I complained about the new masseuse, she brought in Thum!!! So she definitely was working that day\u2026* We got our massages in the communal space with 6 beds divided by curtains, so you could hear new customers arriving and leaving. There was also some construction going on so that disturbed our sessions a little."

I didn't feel that I was being rushed through so they could get the next customer in. They showed excellent attention to detail and everything was clean and hygienic. It was a relaxing experience made better by the fact that the ladies weren't all loudly chatting away to one another in Vietnamese. It really was peaceful. I returned the next day for a hot stone massage and it was just perfect. Vi Spa 2 offers a range of massages but I chose this massage because I do not enjoy deep tissue and traditional Thai as I find them incredibly painful and not the least bit relaxing or enjoyable. The ladies regularly check if the pressure is okay so you get what you're after. They provide lockers with keys for your belongings so you don't need to spend the entire time wondering if your bag is safe. It was hygienic, gently lit and exactly what I needed/wanted. I would definitely go back knowing that they provide outstanding service in a clean, welcoming and professional environment."

The receptionist Thuy was very helpful in advising us what kind of massage would best suit what we wanted. She wasn't forceful or pushy in advising us.The spa itself was very professional, giving us green tea as we waited, and it was very clean and quiet inside. The massage was the best massage I've had (and I've had a number!). Ha was fantastic, applying great pressure and immediately reacting when my body was tight in places. I came away utterly relaxed and wanting another one!Overall it was absolutely fantastic and brilliant value - I'd highly recommend!"

I had a nice shower with clean and fluffy towels. The massage was amazing - Miss Oanh was very skiller and gave me one of the best massages in a long time. She really knows how to massage.Very professional and clean service, I will surely revisit this Spa next time I comeback back to Hanoi."

I can tell you these ladies look small but don't underestimate their strength! It was a real experience and just like in the movies, the lady literally walked over my back, pressure points with their elbows and other different skills, this all in a very clean environment. Something to point that there are lockers for your belongings. It's maybe a bit over the regular price however absolutely worth it!I can recommend this place to everybody who's looking for professional massage in a clean place in the middle of the old quarter."

The first colour I chose had gone so gloopy they had to take it off and I picked another. The second was very thin but they persevered with that one... Main problem was that there wasn't a table or nail bar so the lady had to hold my hands whilst sat in a chair and paint them without resting them on the surface and twice smudged the nails she'd just painted with her own hand! She appeared really nervous and judging by her own nails I wasn't sure she painted nails often... She did 2 coats which wasn't really enough as the polish was so thin and missed a few bits on the sides. The manager was hovering over her checking what she was doing which I think made it worse. It wasn't a relaxing atmosphere... Pick another spa for nails!"

I had been a little concerned that I did not have to fill out a form as I have done for other massages I have had, but I told the masseuse about my knee injury and she listened and changed the massage in that area to avoid further damage. It was a wonderful massage, that was done with the pressure I had asked for and the hot stones were bliss (never tried before). On completion I was given more tea with fruit, and looking at the time realised that I had actually had more than the hour, a lovely change from the norm of clock watching!

Then you are taken to the treatment room. My husband an I had a massage side by side and the room was tastefully decorated with low lighting and pleasant music. The staff spoke excellent English and asked about focus areas for the massage and how strong you wanted your massage. We liked our massage so much, we came back after a 3 day Ha Long Bay tour for another 1 hour aroma massage.

After looking around at the top 5 places to get a massage in hanoi, found this great 2 for 1 deal that Essence was having during 10am-2pm. Arrived at 9am, to book in our massage for 1pm. Both my husband and I got the himalayan salt (i think that's what it was called) massage which included hot stones. Both masseurs were very professional, and adjusted the pressure to suit our needs. Room was clean, music and smells were at the right level, and for ~1.2M or so, for two 90 minute massages, it is at the mid level, but a great bargain."

Easily the best foot massage I've ever had. Went back the following day for a salt/honey scrub, basic facial & hot stone massage. Definitely did not disappoint! The therapist Tim tells me she has been working at the spa for over a decade & I could definitely feel the experience in her treatments. If you go during\"Happy hour\" from 10AM to 13:00 you get 40% off treatmens over 50 minutes (not sure if this is just for hotel guests or not but definitely worth asking). I found the prices to be extremely reasonable. Cannot recommend enough!"

I asked for someone to use more pressure points in the massage to relieve kinks in my neck from travel and computer work. I had a wonderful girl working on my head and shoulders and back massage who more than did what I hoped for and asked for. I think she had worked at the hotel spa for nearly 10 years. I believe her name was Kim and she was so attentive and had good sensitivity to the pressure needed for my back. They gave a great discount when you returned the second time, which I did just before flying out. After each massage, there was tea and watermelon served. I would definitely recommend this place."

We saw that Essencia Spa and Massage came highly recommended. We thought initially it was quite expensive for the packaged treatments. Looking at about \u00a370 per person for 4 hours (something like that). We decided to go for it as it was our last day...we hadn't spent as much as we thought we were going to on our trip and it was our honeymoon after all! We did the Winter Package and it was INCREDIBLE! Started with a honey and coffee body scrub and wrap. My husband had never experienced any kind of spa treatment and he was in heaven. After this we both had a 30 minute soak in a lime and rose petal bath and they bought us in some tea before THE MOST AMAZING 60 minute full body massage. I get quite a lot of massage and have to say this was up there with some of the best I have ever had. I went to another place and my body felt amazing. This was followed by a never ending facial which actually put me to sleep. My husband was a picture with his yellow towelled head band but he loved the facial. Both of us looked completely refreshed after our treatment. The ladies were so lovely and polite and worked blimmin hard for 3 and a half hours. The rooms were clean and warm. The music was fine....not too loud or too repetitive. We both felt we would pay the same to do it again. You would pay triple that in the UK for what we got."

First I just did a normal massage, and the next day I did a 4 hour package. The package was sooooo amazing! I had a time of my life and was treated with such luxury, I was regretting using other massage places in Hanoi and promised myself to only use Essencia Spa in my future Hanoi trips and stay at this hotel! After the spa package, I was told before that I would be given a traditional Vietnamese painting gift but it wasn't available after I did my spa as they ran out. I was very disappointed, but they asked when I was to leave for Seoul and where I was staying. I was leaving the very next day and they said they will get it for me and have it personally delivered to my hotel lobby! They personally delivered and thanked me again for using their spa services and wished me a good trip back. Now that is what I call impeccable hospitality! I will visit this spa and stay at this lovely hotel definitely in the future! Plus I never forget to tell my friends visiting Hanoi to make sure they stop by for a bit of luxury!"

Lunch following in the cafe included a very large and tasty bowl of pho served by wonderful, sweet staff members. My only regret is that we didn't have the option to stay in the hotel.

I actually went back a 2nd time during my trip, and got a body scrub and oil massage this time. Massage is still fantastic, but the salt and honey scrub I choose could be a bit too harsh for my sensitive skin. Highly recommended if you want to look for a good, strong type of treatment massage as the other typical Vietnamese spas I went is often too gentle for my liking. "

Very nice staff, very chatty and helpful, very nice rooms without any noice (we had a room with the window pointing out to the small street), perfect location and a really nice spa. Staying here was like a home away, be prepared for a lot of communication from the staff though, we thought it was charming and very interesting :-)"

The service staff at reception did her best to accommodate my request on the arrangement of the Autumn package, despite a miscommunication in the booking schedule. She was extremely warm, friendly and professional. The masseuses that attended to us were wonderful and attentive to all our needs, albeit i wish she was more thorough in the body scrub and massage. Overall, we are very pleased with the quality, service and value of the package. It was excellent!"

Prices were 660,000 vnd or $31. We mentioned we read it was about $21. They said we would get a 20% discount so we didn't quibble. My husband and I both had good massages together.

It was clean, although not as clinically clean as you might expect at a high-end spa. But then, the treatments cost about US$22 per hour (after our 30% discount from the Essence Hotel) so a fair deal. We went back a few times during our Hanoi stay."

A foot massage sounded wonderful after a full day out tramping around the city. I was not disappointed. It started with a lovely welcome drink of ginger tea and fresh fruit. The room was lovely and relaxing. My masseur was very caring and asked a few times if I was comfortable with the amount of pressure she was using. She worked right up my leg too not just my feet. When I thought it was all over, I sat on a seat with my feet immersed in a warm ginger bath while she gave me a shoulder and head massage. I didn't want it to end. I had opted for the 70 minute massage which I would highly recommend. Thank you Essence Spa for a great experience."

The small reception at the Spa is cozy and well presented. We were welcomed by the smiling therapist and were served tea. We were then directed to the couple room, the massage was pure bliss! The therapists were very professionsal and we were asked where we want them to focus the most. We both wanted a good massage on the back, which we got! We were given 20% discount as we were resident at the hotel. We decided to revisit the spa for a longer treatment, the winter package, 3.5hrs long. I got a fresh coconut full body scub, followed by a flower and lemon bath, full body massage with essential oil, a second full body massage using a hot dry herbs bonbon, facial then a back massage. At the end of it, i was sleeping! This followed by a meal in the restaurant and a gift from the Spa. The meal, gift and massage was all part of the Winter package. For our 2nd visit, we were given 30% off. I will definitely recommend and go back to Essencia Spa. Thank you for making our stay memorable. I will miss all this pampering "

From the minute you are escorted from reception to the spa desk, everything is just of such calm and quality, you are taken through the many options and while the process is explained to you you are provided with some Vietnamese tea. The masseuse was very skilled and professional and continually checked that everything was OK - how could it not be in such a great atmosphere.I would definitely recommend that whether you're staying in the Essence Hotel (and you should) or not, ignore the street side spa options and head for this great facility.Thank you all.Alexander Lobban"

The massage was divine... she cracked all the right places and made much of the aches and pains from sitting on a Vespa for 4 hours plus doing a walking food tour that day disappear. This spa can get quite busy so it's best to make an appointment. It is located near \"Walking Street\" so just be aware that if you go when they've closed the street to cars, the music/noise from the street can be quite loud and ruin the soothing mood you were thinking of having for your massage."

We were met with complimentary tea while we decided what treatment we wanted, followed by a small foot bath which was lovely.I had a facial and my boyfriend had a shoulder and back massage, and we both enjoyed our treatments. The facial was more of a face massage but was incredibly relaxing and left my skin very soft afterwards. Only downside is there is some noise from the street outside but it was the middle of the day and the staff can't help this. Overall I would highly recommend this place for a massage or a facial! Excellent value and very relaxing."

I had an additional body scrub added to my body massage.The massage and body scrub were very good, strength of the lady who did the massage was good, she also did a very thorough scrub for me. The manicure and pedicure were done quite well, perhaps the nail polish they use was about to dry up soon. The eyebrow waxing was not painful and the person would ask if the shape is ok."

They have free wifi so you can internet browse while you're having feet washed in preparation for the massage. I was lead to a room with three beds but there were no other customers there. The spa provide a locker so you can feel safe about your valuables. There was no outside noise and the room temperature was good. The aromatherapy massage was really good, helping sort out my back and right shoulder pain. The same goes with the foot acupuncture, helping out my sore feet. The last part was the facial treatment, which help smooth out my skin.I don't know why but I was given a 10% discount."

I wouldn't have this done on its own though as it was over pretty quickly! I then had a shellac pedicure. Probably one of the most perfect pedicures I think I've ever had. She even did my little toe perfectly which most people laugh at!! Then I had some waxing done. Underarms and half leg. the was wax really great too. Very thorough. I think it was done in the room where they would normally do massages. If it is they I would think the massage isn't very private.It all came to 540,000 (\u00a317/25 USD) so really cheap.

The outside is beautiful in contrast to a lot of stores in the area. The inside is new and trendy. We were instantly greeted with the best tea we had in all of vietnam and attended to. Pricing was unbelievably modest for everything we got done. We got Thai massages (very unique but amazing experience), facials, foot massages, pedicures, and manicures. The staff were all very nice and we highly enjoyed the relaxing break from the busy city. These ladies work very diligently and hard. They spend time on you and give quality services."

The massage was fine but during the massage they started my facial so it wasn't really that relaxing. I asked for a stronger massage and the lady didn't really do a very strong one. Also, the power went out during the massage, which was fine and actually kind of nice because they set up candles. However, the girl that helped with the candles then stayed and was chatting with the lady giving me a massage, which was a little annoying.Overall, I'm surprised this place has rated so highly as I found it average at best, even for the cheaper (compared to North America) prices. A massage I had in HCMC a few days prior was definitely superior."

As a Hong Konger who knows a bit acupuncture, I've tried Chinese massage in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, as well as Thai massage in Bangkok (I'm a frequent traveler to Bangkok) but never had Vietnamese message so after reading those positive reviews on Tripadvisor (and its Certificate of Excellence) I've decided to give it a try.The front door fa\u00e7ade looked clean and professional I must say. It was actually hard to imagine there's such a place with tranquillity in the bustling Old Quarter of Hanoi. Me and my mom had the 60-minute foot massage (230,000 VND, about 10 USD) and were brought upstairs after the staff cleaned our foot with warm water on the base floor. The room upstairs has a drawer though the lock is not functioning. But that's ok. What is totally NOT ok is the pressure, there is NO pressure! Message is about pressure point, if no pressure is given then how can it even claim itself to be giving a massage? The staff keeps rubbing my feet (Yes it's non-stop rubbing up and down) during the whole 60-minute, and I've asked specifically to the staff, for 2 times, to give me \"stronger\" pressure, but zero improvement.I genuinely feel cheated and totally can't understand why other travelers would give this place a 5-star. Next time, if I'm going to do massage, that would be in anywhere but not Hanoi."

Pedicure did not have this problem. Overall, this seems like a nice salon, but make sure they have enough time and that they let the nail polish dry a little before applications another layer.Considering the price, I would come back here again."

Aah.... The facial! It was sheer bliss. We usually try to have some sort of spa treatment everywhere we travel - it is a little luxury after the trekking and touring. Quite honestly, the ones we had today rated right at the top. They were probably the best we have had anywhere. The place was clean and beautifully scented - you step into a different world from the noisy, dirty street outside. By Vietnamese standards, this place may be expensive but in comparison to Australia / UK / Europe, it is fabulous value and in my experience, much better quality. The only improvement i could suggest is that they think about providing those towelling wraps with the velcro closure or elastic at the top that you can put on when you take off your top for the facial.

I had a lovely foot bath (possibly because it was obvious my feet needed it) before being led upstairs for the greatest facial of my life. Even though I ordered a facial they gave me quite a massage as well which was lovely. Everything was very clean and very professional and the masseause was amazing. After a week in the polluted, muggy Hanoi, my skin thanked me. After my facial/massage, I was led down stairs for my pedicure in such a relaxed daze. I got another lovely foot bath before the pedicure which was also fantastic.I highly recommend this place."

Then i went upstairs, yes its a communal room with only curtains dividing the room, however i was alone and i had a locker for my stuff. Then some steam, different products which smelled amazing and natural on my face for 50 minutes. All for 290 00dong which is worth it!"

I have been to the Orchids Spa on Hang Trong twice now, the first for the foot care package - 75 mins 460,000VND including scrub, massage and paraffin mask and then for a shoulder and back massage 250,000 VND (45 mins + 40,000 for 60mins). Each time I just popped in from the street and was able to secure a space straight away. I was provided with a drink on arrival and a foot soak. I enjoyed the ambience of the spa, both times I went on a Sunday and I was the only customer. It is quite modern and nicely lit, the music is soft and relaxing, and the chairs for the foot treatment are very comfortable. The lady I had (same both times) didn't speak much English, but I don't mind this as I don't want someone chatting alot anyway! She did however check I was ok and that she wasn't hurting me which I found reassuring. The back massage included work on the arms, hands, head, neck and briefly the legs as well, tough at times (perhaps just because I'm so stiff) but worth a little pain for the great feeling afterwards. This place is certainly more expensive than others, but for the relaxing vibe of the place and the thoroughness of treatment and attentiveness of staff I would recommend."

            "review": "No relaxation or privacy here!. I was here at the beginning of April by myself and had a massage and body wrap treatment. It was 90-minutes and cost 490,000Dong. It\u2019s a very nice looking place and the main floor is very clean and professional. But that\u2019s where my good impression stopped.Upstairs, I was given a locker for my things. Massages are done in a communal room. \u201cPrivacy\u201d is granted via a completely sheer curtain between tables. There is also a large bathtub in the room, not closed off at all. I\u2019m suspect if you opt for any soaks, this is where it is done. I was given a pair of sheer disposable underwear for the wrap portion of my treatment. There was no robe or towel or anything to cover myself as I walked across the room to my table. Awkward.Treatment commenced by my attendant rubbing some sort of lotion all over me and I ended up face up on the table with my chest completely exposed. Oh wait\u2026the sheer curtain was closed. I was then wrapped in a towel and left to relax for 20 minutes. Sounds nice, however, since I was in a communal room, my relaxing involved listening to conversations between the attendants, and a lot of skin slapping noises as the attendants worked on their clients. Then, I was shown to the bathroom to shower. The bathroom door had a window that was barely frosted. It was off the main massage room. I could see the person outside getting their massage. Surely, if they looked up, they could see me showering. More awkward. When I came out, I was given a pair of cotton shorts to wear during the massage. The massage itself was so rough and painful, I was more tense coming out than I was going in. At the end, she used a hot towel to get the oil off, which was nice. Unfortunately, she rubbed so hard, my skin was literally peeling on my arms. When I was getting dressed (no change room by the way, you get (un)dressed right in the communal room), I took off the shorts I was given. My attendant came back, folded them up, and put them back in the pile for the next customer. That\u2019s disgusting. I have no idea how many people before or after me will wear those shorts.I did not tip and I most certainly don\u2019t recommend this place!"

There are five levels and all with something different for treatments.The foot treatment was just what I was looking for and more. I also booked in the following day for some waxing. I'm pedantic with my full bikini wax, but was not disappointed. The eye brows were well shaped and happy with that too. I had the same technician, Hai, for both treatments and she was very professional and attentive to what I requested.They have three locations; however I went to the one at 108 Hang Trong.I left extremely happy with the treatments I had and would return if I was to be in Hanoi again."

Ms. Hung in the reception area was very friendly and let us shower one last time before heading to the airport.The quality of the services far exceeds the ambiance. We were in a shared room with others who were also getting massages. This was not a big deal to us as there were curtain dividers and the staff took extra care when bringing a new guest in and out to make sure all were comfortable. This is a simple spa, with hardworking and caring staff. We enjoyed our time here very much and will return the next time we are in Hanoi. Thanks, Midori!!!! :-)"

The Swedish massage was mostly soft but with some harder kneading in requested areas. The Thai massage involved much more stretching and clicking but both were excellent. Both masseuses asked us if we wanted them to focus on certain areas and asked several times during the massage if we were happy with the pressure. My masseuse even plaited my hair at the end of my massage! Overall, extremely professional service and very friendly staff.

When we arrived they were very busy and had a 2 hour wait so they called up their other spa (Mido spa) who were available and they took us in a taxi (free) over there.We had two Swedish massages which were good, and in a nice double room. Even though the Mido spa was more expensive they gave us the massages at the price of the Midori spa which was very nice!"

They were accommodating in allowing us to take a shower before the massage. My folks opted for the Vietnamese while I opted for an aroma/shiatsu massage. From the title, you can tell that my massage was bad whilst the folks had a decent experience. It wasn't the pressure - it was the therapist's inconsistency throughout the whole 2 hour session. Seems as if she didn't know what she was doing and could only do a few types of strokes. Also came across as she was just waiting for time to pass. The head massage was her caressing her. Felt so irritated that I was tempted to tell her to stop but it was already towards the end anyway. For the price that this place charges - you'd be much better off going somewhere else. Wonder foot is a much better option (check out their FB). The receptionist did offer me a discount after hearing the feedback but it wasn't about the money. It was an unneccessarily bad start to my holiday. I still paid full price and hence would like to share this honest review."

You enter down a small ramp into a motorcycle carpark and take the lift to the 3rd floor.Ambiance was good and the guy and the counter was polite. We had the 1h vietnamese massage for 240k vnd and the masseuses were highly skilled. They told us to inform if it was too hard or soft. Back massage was good as it got rid of all the tension.

But we decided to go anyway as we found out that the masseurs were visually impaired.The staff at the reception was very friendly & the masseurs greeted us too. As they are visually impaired, they may not be as sensitive with the lights, so you might have to help yourself if you would like the room to be darker. The massage was good as they were sensitive with the parts of the body that needed more attention. The staff also checked in with us occasionally on whether we were ok. We took a 60mins massage each. The price was very reasonable and I would recommend others to come here - it's also for a good cause to support the visually impaired to be gainfully employed. :)"

I was looking for a massage after spending the past 2 days caving in Phong Nha and decided to try this place after searching on TripAdvisor. I get massages at home once every month or so and I like the tough deep tissue techniques mixed with some relaxation. I got the \"Midori special massage\" - 75 min for 360,000 vnd. This massage incorporate 4 techniques - Thai, Shiatsu, Aroma, and Sport and was so perfect for me! My leg muscles are usually a problem spot for me and were particularly sore after my climbing trip but the massage therapist was so amazing!! After a massage I tend to feel more sore for a few days and then feel better but I actually feel so much more loose and relaxed immediately! I really enjoyed the Midori massage because I got my regular sport/Swedish massage but also experienced Thai, which moves your muscles all around and stretches them, plus som shiatsu which was cool. The 75 mins was definitely enough time to cover every body part thoroughly. I thought I might get a foot massage after but my feet got lots of attention here too. My massage therapist was U\u00e0\u0144 and I would absolutely recommend him!Overall, an incredible experience and one of the best massages I've ever had. I would recommend this to everyone, but of course pick the massage techniques that are appropriate for you."

We decided on the half hour foot massage, and bargained a reasonable price for both of us.The massage was fantastic. They constantly checked up on us to make sure the pressure was ok. It's true that you could hear people outside, but it didn't bother us. We left the spa feeling rejuvenated and eager for upcoming adventures. A must!"

They got us in fairly quickly, although they had to ask some other people to come back. My massage was very good. As stated in other reviews this massage supports the blind and their training is excellant. My husband says his was the best ever. There were 3 or 4 beds in each room. My husband started out in another room and then was moved to my room when we had a facial. The facial was not done by a blind person. The only criticism that I have is at the end of the facial they put a oil on our face which they left on. We left very happy and very shiny."

The staff were friendly and courteous, and were clearly well-trained in their massage technique. What I loved about this place was the good cause behind it - they provide employment opportunities to the visually impaired, and helps to show that they are able to do their job equally as well, if not better, than their counterparts. When we left the rain had started, so the receptionist was kind enough to call us a cab and shelter us with an umbrella to the main road. Thank you so much, and if we ever went back to Hanoi, we would definitely return for some pampering!"

Maybe because either I set my expectation too high (based on reviews) or I already had other much better experiences to compare (I tried several massages e.g. Balinese, Javanese, Indian, Turkish, Thai, etc.)Now I will share my experience of \"stone massage\" at Midori spa.The pros:+ friendly english speaking staffs+ good cause for the blind (visually impared)+ clean restroom+ stone session was good, but...+ cheap (360 vnd for 75 min session), but...Cons:- ambience is far from relaxing, room is too small (probably 2x3 m) and the music sounds rather sad- stone session (ca. 30 out of 75 min) was good, the rest was nothing to write home about. The management should do more professional training for the masseus/r if they want to maintain a good business.- location is not ideal, quite hard to find and the surrounding is very busy- though cheap, it is not a good value for moneyI think I wouldn't have missed anything if I had not tried Midori spa in Hanoi."

The staff is very friendly, the price reasonable, the massage very professional and the overall atmosphere ideal for a good relaxing time. We definitely recommend it! My masseuse, Mai, did a great job and made sure to check periodically that everything was going alright. My boyfriend's masseuse, Ha, and his mother's masseuse, Huong, were also very professional, discreet, and great at massages. Also, it's \"blind massage\", which I wasn't familiar with before but it's a cultural practice to provide respectable, accessible jobs to people who are blind or have very heavy vision impediments. We were glad to support this. They have lots of options for massage, including Swedish, Thai, and \"Sport\" (which is apparently more aggressive than the last two), but they also have more soothing massages (which is what we went for) as well as hot stone treatments, facials, mud treatments, etc. Thanks, it was great."

The place is set up for a great cause - to employ those who are visually impaired. The pamphlet says that the staff are trained monthly by staff from mido spa (very highly rated on TripAdvisor). We were both very happy with our treatments. We had two men do the massage and scrub (it is a cultural thing to scrub the chest in a body scrub, but they asked us if we were comfortable with that and were very accommodating and polite). I had Mr Han for my massage and he was great. I had Ms Oauly (not sure of spelling) for my facial and she was also very good. The staff did talk a bit much to each other throughout the treatment which was a bit distracting. Otherwise we were very happy!"

Massaging the legs, back, shoulders, arms, feet and head the Vietnamese technique of clapping and tapping worked a treat. My masseuse, Mr. Thuoc, was fantastic. He knew when and where to apply more pressure and his clapping technique (although the first time I've had this done) was first class. Both my partner and I left Midori spa feeling refreshingly dazed (Her masseuse was Ms. Hue who was very accommodating to her sore legs). The spa is more than just an amazing initiative to help the visually impaired, it is a spa with high standards and great customer service."

The spa itself is pretty basic so if you're looking for luxurious lounging this isn't the place. The quality of services though, are what counts. As you have probably already read, the massages are performed by visually impaired people, and the girl I had, Ms Mai, was extraordinary. Great hands and wonderful technique (I got the basic 60 min Swedish) especially her work on my upper back. I then got a body scrub (highly recommend the green tea... my skin felt amazing afterwards) and a mini facial, both performed by Ms Hue 2 (not to be confused with Ms Hue 1) and while the scrub was basic and got the skin-softening job done, the facial was pretty extensive for being a 'mini'. Ms Hue also had a great massage technique (both on face and scalp) and I thoroughly enjoyed her as well. Overall, great experience and excellent value for the money."

My treatment was carried out by a guy called Lan ( I think ?) his wife has just had their 3rd child the night before and here he was back at work the next day offering a great service. I wish him and his family well for the the future.My wife had treatment with a young lady called Mai and equally sang her praises. The treatment cost $25 US for the two of us for one hour including a tip, I must say great value. They even sent a taxi to the hotel and paid the fare. Please give these guys a try it certainly worked for us."

Last 3 massages I tried all made it worse. In this case i actually came out of the building with less pain! The staff is very friendly and the therapist are competent. My girlfriend and I both had a blind therapist which was perfect and regularly asked whether he was pushing to hard or to soft. After the massage we both had a mini facial and eventually left 2 hours later with a satisfied feeling. The fact that this company helps a good cause only adds to the value."

After 10 days since our last massage and having spent the last 3 days cycling, trekking and climbing in nihn bihn and tamcoc this was the best medicine for our fatigued feet! This spa employs staff that are visually impaired and my husband and I had a lovely experience here. We arrived without an appointment and were asked if we wouldn't mind waiting for 10 mins as the masseuses were busy with other clients. Obviously we didn't mind and happily waited. When it was our turn, the manager was apologetic that we had to wait and we were greeted by our therapists and shown into our room. The soft relaxing music masked the city noise outside and from the first touch of our therapists we were in paradise. Lovely foot massage, very relaxing and felt rejuvenated. Don't miss out on helping a great cause."

After spending the day walking around in this bustling city it's nice to come back and get a massage. I looked around at other spas but they were very expensive. The spa prices at midori spa are fair and reasonable. Upon walking to the salon through a motorbike car park it does look abit dodgy however once you go upstairs it's completely professional, clean and air conditioned. I visited another spa in Hanoi earlier in the week, and felt very pressured to tip at the end of my massage, however midori did not make me feel this way. Of course I tipped the girl anyway but at my free will. This is a great organization and i wish I found it earlier in my stay in Hanoi. "

Moreover, it's a charity that gives a good oportunity to visually impaired people, and they know really good how to use their hands and elbows, real professionals.

Wasn't crowded when I was there so I had a room to myself, which was great. They also gave me a lockbox for my phone and wallet so I didn't have to worry about security during the massage. The masseuse did an excellent job and was incredibly professional. I was so relaxed by the end of it! Afterwards, they let me sit in the lobby for a while using the free wifi- no rush to pay and leave, and they even gave me a cup of tea while I was hanging out.

I tried the aroma massage for $18usd. As the room was being prepared, I was sat in the lounge and offered tea. All staff spoke fairly good english. They give you a form before the massage to tick how soft/hard, and the scent you want but i think this is irrelevant. Overall the massage was very good and relaxing. You can find massages cheaper but the whole package was worth the 18 bucks."

The Hanoi Garden Hotel (and many others in Old Quarter) have a cooperation with the Spa and they offer to pay for the taxa one way from the hotel. Very convenient! The receptionist was friendly and offered good advice and there was a lot of treatments to choose from. Being a novice in this Spa area I felt in good hands. The therapist was very polite and even though her English was limited there were no problems with the communication. I had the Spa Package \u201cRelaxing\u201d with warm body scrub, steam bath and soothing aroma massage preparing myself for a 15-hour flight, and it was worth every dong. The treatment took almost 2 hours and I felt as a new person. Afterwards I was offered tea and fruit making the visit and atmosphere even more cosy. The entire experience was delightful and I was very pleased. Will absolutely recommend this for everybody that wants some outstanding cuddle for themselves."

When she massaged my feet she just sort of did my heel without oil for a long time and then used oil for 2 minutes. She did my upper arms and completely ignored my hand. She did a pretty good job on my back. When she removed the oil she forgot my feet. Now I must mention that my husband was with me and he had a super good massage, also my sister was with us and she was very happy. So maybe this is just luck of who you get or maybe my girl was having a bad day."

I have never had a manicure where the manicurist paid so much attention to my nails! It took almost an hour! They didn't have a huge selection of colors, but I'm just used to having lots of choices in the nail salons in the States. The eyebrow wax was great and not painful. She didn't use the wax with the strip that I'm used to and I preferred the one I received at Marguerite. When we were paying, they gave us each a gift bag with Vietnamese coffee and snacks.

Had a couples massage here and it was a very relaxing experience.From the moment my girlfriend and I walked in, the atmosphere was very calming. We came here late on a Friday night after our visit with the night marker and it was a great way to unwind and come down from a busy day.We were greeted with great hospitality and some refreshing tea.Massages were definitely relaxing. I had my back cracked in ways I didn't know were possible too! But, it felt great. We had 60 minute massages for a good price.Glad we chose this Spa!Cheers,J & T"

It was a WELCOME reprieve from that! It is a very cool, soothing space with nice running water, relaxing music and literally soundproof in the room. I wish I could just stay here!I had the deep tissue \"traditional Vietnamese massage\" for 1 hour for about $18USD at happy hour. It's hard to find cheap massage places here in Hanoi, different from Saigon, so while a bit $$ maybe in Asia, it was much cheaper than the US and very good. The therapist had nice pressure but I wouldnt call it deep tissue like I would be familiar with in the US. Regardless, it was very nice and I would recommend it to others for a relaxing and rejuvenating escape from the busy streets of Hanoi."

Everything about the experience was relaxing, entered the spa and had a cool tea in the reception area which is very beautiful and were shown upstairs to the therapy room which are also lovely, great facilities and a lovely shower room to wash off in afterwards. Only tiny annoyance was the therapists phone went off a few times but they had a little feedback form afterwards and I'm sure it will be easily fixed. They also had a form to fill before your treatment to highlight areas to focus on and areas to avoid if you have injuries. Excellent experience, would recommend to all."

The owner that we met was more than willing to offer us a discount (of about 20%; not sure if he does this for everyone but we happily accepted). Prior to our massage, we were given a survey asking us to quickly fill out what we preferred in our body massage, further assisting this establishment in giving great service. We were kindly asked to take off our shoes, given comfortable slippers, and escorted to our private couples massage room where we had the chance to take a shower (both before and after our body massage), change into silk shorts, and lay down for an incredible couples massage. The masseuse (guy for me and woman for my fianc\u00e9) that we had were really great and knew exactly what they were doing. They were more than qualified and experienced in providing a truly great service, the kind that we couldn't have asked to be better. We came back two days in a row and if we had more time in Hanoi, would have returned yet again. In a city that offers massage spas on every street corner, the Marguerite Spa truly stood heads above the rest. It was very reasonably priced (after all, you get what you pay for) and for 850 VND (approximately $35), we were provided a great 75 minute body massage (Thai for me, and deep tissue for my fianc\u00e9). A truly amazing experience for anyone looking to relax and truly escape on their vacation!"

I on the other hand, rated mine below average: rough hands (almost like an exfoliation), fingernails (scratches the skin at times), hits the bones a lot of times, misses most pressure points and knots (even after being redirected many time).It was also a little disappointing that you are asked to fill in a questionnaire before the massage indicating which body parts to focus on/ avoid, and yet it doesn't seem like the masseuse read them before starting the massage. I guess all this was offset by the relatively cheaper price than in my home country. CONCLUSION: I will probably not come back before trying the other better reviewed spas. I would rather pay a slightly higher price for a better massage."

We stumbled into this Spa after making our rounds on foot which seemed like we had covered all of the old quarter and was in dire need of a massage. We were immediately drawn to how it stood out from the rest of the spas, looked clean and was decorated tastefully.The staff and the owner were incredibly welcoming and kind. Great command of english as was truly hospitable making sure we were treated like Queens. My friend and I chose the Foot Spa and did not want to leave it was that good. I returned on my own for the second time before I had to rush off to the airport and even then they accommodated my request if it meant getting a mani and pedi done under 1 hour. Highly recommended spa if you are into relaxing and stepping away from the noise and the busy streets of Hanoi into this peaceful sanctuary."

Two of us returned after dinner and they were able to accommodate both of us with the cautions and extra emphasis areas each of us requested. I returned solo on another day when many customers were discussing which treatment they would like from the large menu. I was fortunate. They were able to provide the selected massage immediately. While the menu of treatment offerings is well articulated about content, I didn't experience as big a difference in the massage technique as I'd expected. Nonetheless both massages were professional and the therapist on each occasion repeatedly asked if I was OK with the pressure. The whole staff worked together to please and accommodate. I was able to use my credit card which saves on the amount of foreign money needed to be exchanged for Vietnam Dong."

I'd chosen the place because of their professional looking catalogue, decent prices, and the 10% discount I was offered by a handout I'd received. I am so relieved that this is the place I went to. Right from the moment I walked in I was greeted by professional staff (who also paid for my cab to the Spa), had time to relax in comfy leather chairs with a cup of tea before being escorted off to a toom for my Foot Scrub, Spa and Mask (75 min- followed by my manicure and pedicure). Big comfy suede feel chairs with big pillows greeted me in the next rooms, and I had a mud soak for my feet followed by a great exfoliation. My massage was perfect, and the guy focused on all the areas I asked him to. The mask was a delightful way to end that portion, and I honestly almost drifted off to sleep I was so content. 3Following that the most lovely girl gave me a FANTASTIC pedicure. She also had me in laughing with her great stories, and I loved every moment of talking to her. I had two broken toes and she managed to still paint them without causing me any pain at all. I am so thrilled with the job she did. Then my manicure which took a bit of work as I had chipped nailpoish from weeks ago, and damaged nails from my trip to Halong Bay. A different attendant did my manicure and was efficient and polite throughout the experience. I then managed to undo part of her work by forgetting my nails were wet and scratching my head, and she didn't get upset or annoyed, and fixed them for me at no extra charge and with no worries. They happily let me sit comfortably and relax as my nails dried and didn't rush me out the door either, which is what I always seem to get back in Australia! They also have a great Wifi connnection they are happy for you to use, and are quite central. If I was in Hanoi longer I'd happily head back. There was a couple there while I finished my manicure and it was their third visit, which speaks for itself! I'd recommend them for sure!"

My family and I (the four of us) were choosing which spa to go to in the Old Quarter/ Hoan Kiem district. Specifically, we stayed at the Oriental Central Hotel along Hang Bac Street.Upon the advise of Trip Advisor of the nearby spas (including the hotel's in-house spa), we canvassed the spas along Ma May Street, which is literally just a stone's throw away from the hotel. We window shopped the spa rates of 3 different stores and ended up choosing Hanoi Marguerite Spa.Pros:1. Among the upscale spas in Ma May Street, Hanoi Marguerite Spa is more affordable. We were specifically looking to either have a traditional massage or a hot stone massage.2. They offer a wide range of spa services, from massage to facial to nail polish to body treatments, with different time durations. Just check their menu of services.3. It is strategically located which makes it very accessible to tourists. It is located at Ma May street and a corner. You can't miss the signage. 4. The front desk personnel and the whole staff are friendly and smiling. They can communicate in English relatively well which makes the whole experience more pleasant.5. The spa facility is clean and upkeep is great. The place even smells fragrant and relaxing with some herbal oil.6. Most importantly, the masseuse and the massage experience was good. The masseuse knows what she is doing and adjusts the massage pressure according to your preference. The hot stone massage was a very relaxing and sleep-inducing experience. Nothing negative to really point out.7. They are open until 11:30PM. They also accept reservations.8. We were offered a token after our massage. We were handed a small pack of ground coffee and coffee drip filter.Cons:1. You have to make a down payment if you make a reservation. This of course prevents a client no-show.2. The spa rooms and beds are located at the 2nd floor up to the 4th floor. This could be a minor issue for people who are already tired of climbing up stairs after a long day of walking. The steps are quite steep too.Would I recommend this place to others? Definitely yes.Would I go back?Definitely yes."

There is no shortage of spas in the old quarter but Hanoi Marguerite stands out due to its excellent treatments, friendly staff, and clean facility. I visited twice during my recent trip to Hanoi and enjoyed both treatments. The first time I got a 60 minute foot massage that was pure bliss and turned out to be more of foot, leg, lower body massage. The second time I chose an aromatherapy massage that was just what I needed before getting in a 14 hour flight home. The pressure for both massages was excellent (I chose medium) and the staff checked in to make sure I was doing okay throughout the treatments. This spa is the perfect place to escape the chaos of the old quarter for a few hours!"

            "review": "\"Absolute bliss\". I went to Marguerite Spa after reading Trip Advisor and also after declining the recommendation of my hotel to go elsewhere. I was not disappointed. I had been travelling for 6 weeks with many plane trips and walking what seemed like 100's of kms. My back and feet were very sore. Having had a hot stone massage 3 days before at another establishment which was lovely but not enough for my aching muscles. I chose to have a 90 min deep tissue and 45 min foot massage. I had originally booked 60 mins but as my deep tissue massage went overtime and my feet were worked on my feet during the body massage. I shortened it due to time restraints. This was not a problem for them. I had Chuong, a male masseur. I was a bit hesitant at first but his strong hands were exactly what I needed to get deep into the soreness. I was given a set of satin boxers to wear so felt sufficiently modest. I have had a lot of massages and I would say they would have to have been the best I've ever had. My soreness was gone instantly. The spa itself is only a month old and very clean. I would highly recommend it and will return when I come back to Hanoi."

The massage was very firm, sometimes a little too firm. The guys on the front desk were very sweet and gave us a gift of Vietnamese coffee. Great English spoken by these guys. Good value for money too."

Really relaxing and she used a lot of pressure like I had asked. Everyone here was also really nice and it was really clean. I just wish I had asked for the woman's name that massaged me since I'll be going back in 3 days when I'm back from Ha Long Bay!"

            "review": "Bliss in the heart of the Old Quarter. I should start this review by saying I'm a girl who gets regular massages - here in Australia I have one every week and when I travel I try and get them as much as possible. So on my recent holiday in Vietnam, I was certainly seeking out places to get a foot massage every few days.Hanoi was our last stop on a 3 week adventure through Vietnam and I was fortunate enough to notice Marguerite Spa on the afternoon that we arrived back from Halong Bay. We stayed at the La Siesta Hotel & Spa (and I also had a nice massage there before I found Marguerite) and this place was just on the corner up from our hotel. From the outside it looked like an inviting oasis in the hustle and bustle that is the Old Quarter and that is what drew me inside.How lucky I was to have stumbled on this place - they had only been opened a week and from the minute I walked through the door I couldn't have asked for a friendlier welcome. I was seated with a cool drink while they prepared the room and turned on the a/c and then I was transported by what is probably one of the best foot massages I have had in all my travels, not just in Vietnam (honestly). My masseuse was male and he was awesome - the exact right amount of pressure (I like a hard massage) and he regularly checked that I was okay (I was more than okay - I was floating). It was total bliss - and then he did my head/face ... wow. Just wow!After the massage I was again given a seat with a cool drink and had a bit of a chat with the owners about how new the place was and how much I enjoyed my massage. They even sent me off with a little gift, which just makes my memory of the place even nicer. And then there was the price - amazing value for money - and much much cheaper that the spa at La Siesta.Coming from a massage-lover I seriously highly recommend Marguerite Spa - and when I return to Hanoi (and I will return) I shall seek them out again. My only disappointment was that I left the next day and couldn't fit in another treatment with them - next time I shall book a few treatments. I wish them all the very best luck in their new venture - they are fabulous. Go here!"

The masseuse was well trained in Thai massage and knew exactly where all my trouble spots were. Staff are very friendly and professional. The prices are also cheap and affordable. Interior is clean and modern as it's fairly new. We left feeling refreshed and energised. Highly recommended!!"

No doubt more expensive than some other massages in town the masseur really knew what he was doing and the environment was very tranquil. Would definitely recommend this oasis in the heart of the Old Quarter."

The masseuse was a really tiny girl, but she was really strong. And off course, when she's standing on your back with her full weight, you're gratefull she's so small. Wonderfull massage, exactly what I needed after travelling almost 24h from Belgium to Vietnam.Price was also good, 500k dong for 75minutes (i had a discount voucher of 15% via a travel agency)"

It was so inviting and clean and the staff were so friendly that we couldn't go past it. They have everything on the menu you could want from a spa from massages, to pedicures to facials. Very reasonable prices as well. It's only just opened they told us, so we even got a discount. Although they were all so professional and welcoming you wouldn't know it was a new business. I think it will soon reach #1 on trip advisor."

Was actually eating lunch next door at the Newday Restaurant and they recommended the spa across the street, however we saw this one on the way so checked it out. It is fairly new, so very clean. They greeted us with very warm and friendly smiles and helped us choose the best service. The man who gave me the massage was very well trained in Thai Massage. He was 100% professional for the entire time, was friendly and talked a little, however kept the atmosphere very tranquil and relaxing.... a great mix of both. Ended the massage with an amazing scalp massage that put me to sleep. The room that my massage took place in also had a shower to rinse off the oil. I was very relaxed for the rest of the day. The entire spa was EXTREMELY clean and sanitized!I would for sure recommend this place to anyone looking for a great massage in Hanoi!"

We were in Hanoi and wanted to get massage for a relaxing moment and also because I had badly hurt my hip just before the trip and found it a little difficult to walk the city.You cannot walk in the Old Quarter without being offered -and sometimes pestered- by people offering you to get into a massage place.We were recommended the Hanoi Marguerite Spa by our hotel, the Milton Boutique Hotel and decided to trust them. They sent a complimentary (FREE OF CHARGE, for those readers whose first language is not English) taxi to pick us up from our hotel. So, it is better to book from your hotel to have everyrhing arranged for you.I believe the Spa has two separate places in the Old Quarter.We were greeted and offered a drink before getting on with the massage session. The place is spotless -actually it opened recently- and comfy.The staff is very helpful and genuinely kind.The massage was great and relieved a lot of stress and enabled me to walk more easily for our last day in Hanoi.We felt refreshed and energized and left happy.I would sincerely most definitely recommend Hanoi Marguerite Spa, for a relaxing moment.Please, leave a tip to the massage young ladies to show your appreciation, although you do not have to. They work hard for your enjoyment and deserve all we can give back. So, if you can leave a small tip, kindly do. If you cannot, that is OK too, nobody asked for anything other than the rates clearly displayed on their advertising literature."
