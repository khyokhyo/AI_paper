Here you may experience the locals and the seafood markets/restaurants and /or take a boat ride to one of the several islands. We took a short boat ride to Hap Mun Beach Bay. Very few people there but a very nice, clean, white sand beach. Very clean changing and bathroom areas. You may want to bring your own food/snacks, although you can purchase some drinks at a slightly higher prices. The water was extremely clear and fresh.The same boat ride company will pick you up at an agreed time.Once in town, you may want to eat or drink some tea overlooking the beautiful fishing boats!"

            "review": "Hard to be clear on this-. Sai Kung, been there twice, the first time we enjoyed walking around the shops. We thought it would be great to go back and take a boat trip. We paid $300HK (for two) for one hour Sampan ride. the two hour ride would have taken us to some caves, but as we have some great caves in Scotland, wasn't sure it was worth the ride/cost. the one hour ride was around the bay, without any other passengers. However, it was as if the driver just wanted us to sit in the water. Paddling would have been quicker. so we have learnt a lesson- go to Sai Kung, walk around the shops, and take a very cheap ferry ride to the local islands, you will see more than you would with a one hour sampan ride. If you want to go on a sampan go to Aberdeen and negotiate there (about $100-$150HK or less). You'll see slightly more, but still not a lot in half an hour. We took the long road back by bus to Sha Tin and then train to Hung Hom (near our hotel) Sha Tin's bus station is very close to railway station. Sai Kung is a place to go once you've been to HK a few times and looking for somewhere different."

We took a boat ride around the islands off Sai Kung which was a little hairy at times once we got out into the open sea. The coastline of these islands is fascinating. Lots of interesting rock formations, many caves and holes through rocks. Back on land we watched people selling fish directly from their boats at the dock. We then went to a restaurant (Hung Kee Seafood Restaurant). The food was amazing! After lunch we went for a wander through the old part of Sai Kung and checked out a small Temple (Tin Hau Temple & Hip Tin Temple \u2013 called The Temple). It was a very enjoyable day."

However the weekends do get quite crowded so it is best to visit during the week. Stroll along the harbour front and eat dim sum or go to 'the square' and enjoy a coffee or lunch at one of the western style restaurants there. You can even hire a sampan for a trip around the small islands."

            "review": "FANTASTIC !!. After much studying of TA Reviews, decided on a day trip to Sai Kung, took MTR from TST to Diamond Hill, then spent time at the attached shopping Mall, very nice with a great UniQlo store on the ground level, (great store with really great prices), then took the # 92 bus to Sai Kung. The bus terminal is attached to the MTR station, but be carefull, you have to cross several marked roadways with ped. crossings marked, but the bus and mini-bus drivers scream around at a great rate of knots, so keep a good lookout, we were almost skittled twice. The bus ride was great, we managed to get the front seats on the top deck and had a 45 minute panoramic ride all the way to Sai Kung. The route winds it way through small rural villiages and into a yacht club area / marina before reaching the end of the road, quite a scenic little trip through some of the more isolated areas of Hong Kong. Sai Kung was an amazing place, built on the edge of the sea, watched fisher people selling their live fish and seafood from the waterfront from small dories filled with live fish, quite entertaining. The seafront is lined with seafood restaurants, we chose one and had a full 5 course meal and beer for just under $500 HK, quite reasonable, and the quality of the food was very good, steamed fish, scallops fried rice. It may be a bit of a mission to get to but the bus trip was part of the fun, a really nice days outing away from the hustle and bustle of central Hong Kong. Highly recommended."

            "review": "Gorgeous Hiking and a great little town to visit!. Sai Kung Country Park is a beautiful place to hike. There are beaches, islands, peaks and lingering trails. It is easy to search the internet for a hike to your liking Look into taking a speed boat out to one of the islands too. You will see the gorgeous GeoPark formations. Spectacular. The most eastern island is Tung Ping Chau. You can arrange a boat there. Snorkelling is pretty good here and there is a lovely, easy stroll of 7 kilometres around the island. There is one restaurant and it is inexpensive and okay as long as you like the Cantonese cuisine. Save your gourmet expectations for another trip! The town of Sai Kung is charming and the seafood restaurants are numerous. There is also some nice, unexpected shopping. To get to Sai Kung from Central, take the red line to North Point, switch to the purple line and head to Hang Hau. Take exit B and turn left to the bus terminus. The Green Mini Bus number 101M will take you there. The GMBs take Octopus card or correct change. The ride can be wild depending on the driver. It takes around 25 minutes depending on traffic. I suggest going in the morning to enjoy a whole day. If you love good ole American ribs or pulled pork and beer served in chilled glasses, head to Anthony's Ranch!"

Where I was staying ( in a private home) we saw 50-60 cows meandering alongside the road every day.

So far in my opinion, the fastest and most efficient way of coming from town is to take MTR to Choi Hung Stop, then change to the mini green bus. The ride on the mini green bus is an experience. Really fast in my opinion. Strolling by the waters is quite an experience. Can see the locals selling their catches from their boats. Had the chance to explore the area a little bit more. Interesting to observe how they locals go about their daily lives. There are also shops where you can do some shopping. There are also some pretty hip cafes and shops in the area.We booked a boat to tour the islands for an hour in the evening. Cost us about HKD300. I believe with some further bargaining, can go a bit cheaper. Nevertheless, was a nice relaxing ride.To end off the day, we went to the Hung Seafood. For HKD488, menu for 2, we shared the food among 2 adults and 1 child. Can choose up to 4 seafood dishes and will get a complimentary fried vegetables. We only chose 3 seafood dishes including steam abalone, bamboo clams and steamed scallops. We had char Siew with BBQ pork as our fourth dish. With the vegetables and we ordered rice, we had a fulfilling dinner. Had enjoyed Sai Kung. Will go back again."

From there, take green bus A11 all the way to the last stop which is Sai Kung. The journey from TST to Sai Kung was a very pleasant one hour on a sunny Friday morning. Our aim was to try the fresh seafood from Loaf On, a 1 Michelin Star restaurant. Unfortunately we had a really hard time locating the restaurant as we were looking for a huge place with lots of tables and chairs by the seafront.We walked the length of the seafront and still could not find it despite asking 3 different people. In the end, we settled for lunch at Chuen Kee Seafood Restaurant which had two very visible restaurant fronts. It was not a bad choice and we enjoyed our meal very much. Our stomachs filled, we continued our search for Loaf On and in the process stumbled upon a very interesting arts shop selling wooden carvings of animals.The shop owner gave us clear instructions on how to find Loaf On and we finally found it ! At the Sai Kung arch, turn right then left into the first alley. It is a discreet little air-conditioned place on the right. There are NO tables or chairs in the front. We made a mental note to try their food the next time. Take the A11 bus back to Choi Hung station. Facing the road, turn right of the bus stop and take a short walk to the underpass leading back to Choi Hung station. There are no signs, so do ask the locals if you are lost."

A great destination for your visit to HK."

There was quite a hike leading to this beach. About a two hour walk was required due to multiple landslides that have caused the road to be blocked to all vehicles. Be sure to bring plenty of water and possibly gear to spend the night on the beach. There are a few small shops that rent over night gear, however I didn't spend the night. The beach is secluded which meant there weren't many people on the beach. We took the boat back to Sai Kung at 7pm which was ideal for the sunset. It was the most beautiful sunset cruise I have ever been on. I will upload more pictures once I get them off of my camera. This was one of my favorite experiences in hong kong!"

The promenade has several seafood restaurants, most with a set menu dependent on the number of guests. Set menus are fine and they contain some choice but you are better off choosing what you would like from the tanks then selecting which way you want it cooked. Be sure to always confirm the price ahead of time as fish, crab, lobster are all by weight and the price can be extreme if you are not careful. Sai Kung also has a place for beer and wine, named the bottle shop which has an excellent selection. You'll see many expats at numerous English/Irish pubs in town. There are two bars named 'Casa' which have reasonably priced beer and wine and have nice Tapa dishes as well. Along the peer you can negotiate a price for hiring a boat for either taking a cruise around the islands, snorkelling/diving or taking you some of the island seafood restaurants. Boat trips are surprisingly reasonable. Stroll along the piers as well to see the fishermen selling their catch and be amazed at how many photographers are there trying to photograph the birds that hover above the harbour."

We took a trip to Hong Kong for our Chinese New Year break from the school that we work in and hoping not to break the bank spent three nights hiking and camping around Sai Kung. If you are into outdoor trips like this then we highly reccomend walking section 2 of the Maclehose trail and camping on the beaches as you go! The hike is challenging in places but insanely beautiful and the beaches were secluded with very few other people despite it being public holiday time. There are great food and drink options available on Ham Tin beach and also Sai Wan beach, but nothing except a drinking water tap on Long Ke, so if you do camp there then take enough food with you for that night and the next day too. If I were to do it again I would take a taxi to the second reservoir at the end of section one, hike and camp on Long Ke the first night, Sai Wan the second and then Ham Tin on the third. Or with just two nights hike from Long Ke to Ham Tin in one day and finish the trip there with the best food on the trail. Can't beleive the camping was totally free! Love love love Hong Kong"

It's a lovely place. you can go out on a junk boat or dine in one of the many restaurants. a great little town. parking's a bit of an issue on weekends and as there's only one road in/out there are traffic jams a plenty on weekends. old-town is definitely nice to walk through and plenty of little shops to be checked out."

Then head down to the marina and rent a junk boat. I think it cost us around $100 USD. The boat took us out to a private island where we spent several hours just hanging out. On our return we went to one of the many seafood restaurants, chose an incredible looking lobster, and they cooked it up for us. IT WAS AMAZING. This was a highlight of our HK trip. I hope you enjoy as well."

You can then pop into town where you'll see many Gweilos who have made this place their home, visit the Tin Hau temple and then wander back down to the promenade to enjoy a fresh seafood dinner served by one of the many Chinese restaurants."

It was easily accessible by MTR plus bus or minibus (the MTR App recommends MiniBus 1A from Choi Hung; the Sai Kung website suggests an alternate approach from Hang Hau if you're on Hong Kong Island; you can also arrive by ferry). Some of the rundown buildings suggest a less developed environment that you might see in rural China or the Middle East. The harbor is full of fishing boats, dive boats, yachts, and ferries of various sizes and shapes. There are countless seafood restaurants along the waterfront with numerous plastic tanks full of creeping and swimming creatures. Had lunch at one of the local restaurants, followed by a cruise around Kiu Tsui Chau / Sharp Island with Kitty's Tours. The cruise was a bit disconcerting, as 12 passengers, the boat driver, and the cruise director were crammed into a small dinghy without life jackets in sight. There was no safety briefing, and the narrations about some coral or sea life and some rock formations were all in Cantonese. After circumnavigating Sharp Island, you're dropped off at the main pier on the Island with the option to return on one of the twice hourly ferries. There's a smaller second island connected to Sharp's Island via a rock and sand corridor that's submerged at low tide; a short hike up to the top of the hill provides great views of the bay of Port Shelter, the town of Sai Kung, the nearby shoreline, numerous islands further out in Clearwater Bay. I think there's a beach on this secondary island as well. It's all very quiet and tranquil, with strange pineapple and other volcanic rocks and a few shells and aquatic creatures in the tide pools. There's a swimming beach with lifeguards and a confined area with netting in the water. The return ride on the ferry was better, on a larger wooden boat with lots of life jackets clearly visible. I can see why the locals would come here to get away from the breakneck pace of city life, hang out on the beaches on one of the islands accessible by charter boat, or sit on the waterfront and eat fresh seafood. Fresh seafood was available for sale off some of the small fishing boats. Of note, some of the kaido ferry boats for hire don't look like they would pass muster with the US Coast Guard. Many of the signs of the ticket booths along the waterfront are in Chinese, although some of the shore agents are adept at pitching in English. But, it's not easy to figure out which particular boat is being chartered, so ... buyer beware. Reassuringly, there were several harbor patrol police boats plying the waters (leaving big wakes behind)."

Buses are the cheapest way to get to and from Hong Kong International Airport, and the \"A\" routes are the most comfortable among all airport bus routes. The Airbus A41P plies between the airport and Ma On Shan. The route is serviced by double-decked buses with air-conditioning. The luggage racks allow to store your luggage while you enjoy a bus ride. The bus stop (Ground Transportation Centre) is situated outside the Arrival Hall on the right side. So, to take a bus from the airport you need to get out of the Arrival Hall and turn right. Follow the direction signs. At Ravana Garden we stepped out and switched to the 299X bus. Within 1 \u00bd hours from the airport, we were in Sai Kung. It is difficult to find accommodation in this town. There are no hotels. The only possibility is Air BnB and to rent a tent on the beach. There are several places where you can rent a tent along the Mc Le Hose trail. We stayed in the old town (air BnB). The old town is so much fun. Feels like a hutong. There are many many great (fish) restaurants and shops. We liked Sai Kung a lot! There is plenty to see and it has a very laid back vibe.Unfortunately, it rained non stop on the day we were going for the Mc LeHose Trail and the beach: Sai Wan Beach.From town we took the bus to the pier and started our hike back to the Sai Wan Pavillion (about 16 kilometres). The track is great, the path totally concrete; so very easily accessible, not difficult at all\u2026.but when you walk in a heavy (typhoon) rainstorm and the whole path turns into one big river, it\u2019s hard to see fun it it.Anyhow, we did it. We believe that on days with great weather, this area must be heaven. Sai Wan Beach is a short hike (approximately 45 minutes) from Sai Wan Pavillion. The beach itself is relatively small, but has lovely clean white sand and a very gentle drop off in depth (ideal for those who want to paddle rather than dive straight in!). A short way up the hill from the beach there are two waterfalls and fresh water pools where you can swim and cool off away from the crowds. Sai Wan beach is flanked by two steep hills either side, forming a protected bay, but this also means that you are totally cut off from any signs of town or village life, and you can relax in peace far away from the sounds of traffic and people that are our normal soundtrack in Hong Kong.How to get there: take the 29R bus from Sai Kung which will drop you at Sai Wan Pavillion (approx 25 minutes). To get to the waterfalls, walk to the end of Sai Wan beach and follow the trail left from the river. The path gets very narrow and quite rocky \u2013 I seriously suggest you don\u2019t do this in flipflops! \u2013 but after about 10-15 minutes, it will become wider and clearer and you will see the waterfalls ahead of you."

Sai Kung is the famous fishing village for the locals and definitely where the true locals purchase the seafood at a much cheaper price than the wet market. You can also have lunch here at a famous seafood restaurant where many celebrities have dine at. The cool thing about Sai Kung Village is that you can see how the locals negotiate for their food and seeing the fisherman selling the fish alive. It is truly fascinating and I highly recommend it."

This is a place where high rise building is not allowed so you have a total different experience from the rest of Hong Kong where high rise buildings are everywhere due to extreme land shortage. You have to take bus 92, 792M or 96R or minibus 1A or 101M from the city to the terminal stop and then take a local taxi to go to where you want to go and call another to meet you after the visit. As there are many routes of visits, you have to go to the map and decide which route you want to visit first. The easiest trip is to go to the local reservours. Some local buses are available but they are not very frequent and are normally operational during weekends and public holidays only. More information is available from the Hong Kong government websites for Sai Kung tourism."

The more affluent locals are often accompanied by their maids or nannies and you will struggle to find a vacant table in the local eateries from 8.00am to 14.00pm.From Monday to Friday, you can enjoy leisurely strolls around the village and take a trip to one of the beautiful outlying islands, but at the weekends, this place is bursting at the seams. It's regarded as an excellent weekend retreat for the City folk with some of the best seafood restaurants in Hong Kong. Expensive, but delicious. If you fancy having a go at cooking seafood, there are many stalls on the seafront offering Lobsters and Crabs of various sizes, Shellfish, Prawns, Fish and Sea urchins freshly caught that very day.There is a wonderful Irish pub along the terrace, by the mini-shuttle bus rank, which offers a great pint and which shows PL matches.

Wonder around the boardwalk area and see the fresh sea food markets where people sell their catch straight from the small boats. Many restaurants have tanks of fresh fish and other sea food for you to choose, how ever the boardwalk also has many smaller less expensive eateries to choose from. I found a great little fish and chips stall that served some of the best fish and chips I have had in a long time. Just a little further down the boardwalk was a great burger place that had tasty and filling burgers with all types of fillings. All around this area you will see items from all over the world on offer, lollies from the UK, Beer from Germany and American style burgers are just a few of the delights on offer.A definite must see place when you are planning your trip to Hong Kong whether you go as part of an organised tour of you jump on a Mini Bus or Bus, getting there and back is easy just make sure you take your camera and don't think you will be able to see it in an hour of two as there is a lot to see and do in Sai Kung."

All the giant seafood and shellfish placed at the tank for you to pick. Apart from the seafood street, some fishermen also sold their catch in the boat.

Upon arrival we could immediately see the numerous seafood restaurants which their seafood in tanks. These make for a nice photo pic. The evening period is particularly nice for a walk about as it is cooler. There is also a quaint market place where fishmongers sell their catch in the boats. Customerspoint to what they want and agree on the price. The fishmongers are deft with their hands - you could observe just how quickly they de-scale the fishes. I understand that it is possible to buy seafood from the fishmongers and take them to the restaurants to cook. But I would recommend that for visitors who are especially not conversant with the local language to just patronise one of the restaurants and order your food there. The dinner we had was ok, not fantastic and looking at other diners, we could have done better with food ordering. A nice experience overall. By the way, the queue for the same minibus for our way back was a long mile but no panic, the buses came one after another and we waited just 20 minutes in that long line to get on the bus."

Well known for beaches and some beautiful hikes in the country park. A really great hike that I like is starting at Man O Shan (just towards the west of Sai Kung country park) going up the hill which has spectacular views and then coming down to Sai Kung. There are a number of restaurants and bars which have come up in this area lately, so a good getaway overall. It also has some good diving spots, not comparable to countries like Thailand or Indonesia, but nevertheless, it is one of the few spots in HK. Worth visiting this place if you are a resident in HK or a tourist!"

Further down in town there are a number of fish restaurants. We ate at one that stated something about Guide Michelin (sorry I forgot the name) but the food we had was fresh and delicious. Value for money: good. We then wondered around the streets of Sai Kung, visited the Tin Hau Temple and had a Starbucks on our way back to the car.

Just 4 HK$ an hour as compared to a Sunday 30HK$ in Central and much healthier too as there is much to do in a much more healthy environment.Had lunch in Sri Lankan AJ's. Good food, but as children were with us, so had to compromise on the spiciness of the food, which somewhat detracted the cuisine. This, the owner was not very happy with, as he said that Sri Lankan food is best enjoyed with its original spiciness.Finished the day with a walk down the promenade, where all the Seafood serving restaurant's abound. You can make a selection from the vast repertoire of fresh sea food floating in their glass cages and they will cook for you.Walked around a bit to soak in the atmosphere. Enjoyed surveying the giant Chinese Bunyan tree adjoining the children's park, where the musicians too entertained the crowd.All in all, a perfectly entertaining sunny Sunday."

Did not try buying from them as was first trip there. Went to a restaurant to have a meal. Realised that these restaurants will actually cook if you were to buy from the fishermen....depending on how much you bargain from the fishermen and if the restaurant have an exact comparison, otherwise, it is hard to tell which is considered more/less pricey.In any case, the restaurant range of seafood is more and I saw the cooking costs can be here HKD30 + there add HKD25 etc so by the time the item is cooked haha not sure what the cost will be also.Take a good stroll by the seaside. Especially during the cold weather, it is great and there are some stores selling some stuffs aside from dried seafood.The cappuccino served by a western restaurant sandwiched by two big seafood restaurant (slightly hidden in an alley) is good price at only HKD15.Quite some people walk their dogs along the promenade and it's a nice sight.Ah, there is a public toilet opposite the bus interchange. Ask around if you need directions. There are some signs but may not be very prominent.When I am there next round, I will look out for their \"bo lo char siew pau\" as I heard it is great. Best time to visit is probably winter to spring where the weather is good. Oh, it can be a bit colder than down town so do bring slightly warmer clothing.

You can almost always see the sea on the ride into the outer skirt of Hong Kong. It is also the place to go if people want to get away from the City. Sai Kung is famous for its seafood eating culture, local dessert and specialty coffee shops. There are many beaches, national park and many cultural traces where you can explore. Many trails to walk on and many camp site or barbecue sites for the public to use. Really a great getaway for locals, especially it's at most 1 hour away from any part of Hong Kong by car."

For me it was right up there with the Caribbean.Once back to the village we walked around to all of the boats where people were selling FRESH seafood, I mean really, you can't get any fresher!The down side to the village for me - and only having a day here - was that I didn't know any of the restaurants and constantly felt like the waitstaff or restaurant managers were trying to get over on us. Lots of pressure to order very expensive food. So much so that we didn't eat anywhere, we got up from the table and went back to the city for dinner. I think that if we had a little more time to get to know the area we could have enjoyed some good seafood cuisine.Overall - great trip and I would definitely return"

You can also go on a short trip on a boat - they will take you around some island and then drop you on a beach, from where you can be collected later. This is the place for a sea food lover - the choice is the most impressive in Hong Kong. We have not tried it and ate in different restaurants, but - IMHO - you can try whatever you want. Everything is available.Lots of little eateries available as well as small shops.Sai Kung is worth visiting on weekends - it is crowded but little ladies with their perfectly groomed dogs (often carried in a baby stroller) are definitely unforgettable!"

We still had to drive from the train station to go to Sai Kung. It is a neat place. We had lunch at a dimsum place, and their food was delish! We went to the seaside where they had a lot of seafoods for sale, and also a lot of souvenir items. And, I have never seen so many dog breeds in one place! What a charming day it was!

Locals visit Sai Kung for hiking, beach, swimming, sight seeing, offshore fishing, BBQ, picnic and visit live seafood restaurants (fish tanks lined up along the street for viewing and shopping). Public transportation is the best options as parking is limited. A few spots are very remote where public transportation is very limited. Some can only be reached via local fishing boat (can be arranged in advance). Sai Kung center is about 45 min away from TST in Kowloon via Taxi. Summer is warm so pick a AC restaurant for better dinning experience. Some restaurant offer roof top dinning area (if you are lucky to feel the sea breeze) Weekend and public holidays are SUPER BUSY. Traffic jam and ocean of people packed the area. Do make advance reservation for dinner. Shop around for live seafood (common dishes). Those closer to the center cost more but they are conveniently located/popular. Speak Cantonese do help or have a friend take you around. Written note will help ordering at restaurants. My advise for 1st timer: get there and have dinner so that you are familiar with the logistic (2-3 hours experience). For second and more visit: Pick a spot for some outdoor activity and then have dinner (full or half day excursion). Have fun :)"

The first thing I noticed that, while marketed as the \"Sai Kung Fishing Village\", it was not a village at all, more like a mid-sized town (I think the population is ~12,000). If you therefore expect an authentic Hong Kong fishing village experience, you'll be disappointed.Next thing I noticed was that there wasn't much fishing going on. At the very edge of the town there was a fishing boat harbor (I didn't see any actual fishermen), but the vast majority of the shore is taken up by the promenade, which is anything but fishing-related. The promenade is just a large commercialized space for water sports and transport boats to nearby islands. Maybe one of those has a fishing village? I don't know. I didn't take a boat, and in any case none of the boat operators seem to speak English, so unless you know exactly where you want to go, talking to them is pointless (unless you speak Cantonese).The prices all around are on the expensive side\u2014the seafood restaurants can have prices double of those in Hong Kong/Kowloon, and the food is not especially different.Going into the town itself, it's actually somewhat nice, in that it's much less crowded than Hong Kong, but overall it's unremarkable. There is a Buddhist temple on the main street, a public square and... that's pretty much all.I leave some hope that the atmosphere on the islands is more authentic, you can go there by boat. However, you really need to know where you're going in advance, I assumed that for a tourist area this wouldn't be difficult to figure out. I was wrong."

Although it's starting to get developed, it still keeps a lot of its fishing village charm, with fishermen selling their catches off their boats right off the pier. Lots of paid tours take you out to the geological reserve, but my favourite part is the beautiful scenery, and the fact that you can rent kayaks and windsurf boards for ridiculously cheap prices. Then you paddle around and explore the islands in this sheltered bay."

A stroll in the promenade and in the public pier (there are two) is a rewarding experience. Take the time to watch the fishermen in their boats by the pier to segregate their catch in different containers: live fish and seafood for sale to whoever is interested. The village itself offers a temple and a wide range of shops from Starbucks and McDonalds to classic chinese street restaurants. But the main offering is its seafood restaurants. For the Brits that miss home there is even a fish and chips shop (Chip In).The 'must' visit restaurant for seafood lovers is Chuen Kee (any of the many by the pier). It is a Michelin recommended restaurant also endorsed by famous food writer Chua Lam. You can choose from a number of set menus with many offers. We chose the set menu for two where we could order 4 dishes out of the 14 offered.We chose sauteed lobster with noodles and cheese sauce (apparently the shop's speciality), stir-fried clams with black bean sauce, steamed fish with ginger and spring onions, steamed crab with chinese wine, a vegetable dish (pakchoi with garlic), and fruit (watermelon). The cost of these was HK$418 which is a real bargain considering that all the dishes were in full portions.We returned to HK with the 16 seater 1A minibus as suggested by other contributors who we thank for their suggestions. A wonderful day out which we strongly recommend!"

Interesting drive, however our mini bus broke down & the bus driver hailed another bus for us. As it was a different company we had to pay the fares again! The feel there is so different from rest of Hong Kong as one of my friend exclaimed \" we arrived south of France!\" It is a pretty charming area by the sea coast with lots of small boats around. Many are fishermen who bring in their catch to sell direct to the tourists there. We bought a big squid, prawns, fish,shell fish, clams...whatever they could offer we bought a bit. There is a restaurant at one end which will cook for a fee and we ordered a plate of vegetables and drinks from them. They charge a sum for cooking. As our Hong Kong friends knew the owner of the restaurant we were able to book a table easily. Quite a fascination for some & it's something different one can do in Hong Kong!"

The key to eating fish is to eat local and eat fresh and challenge imports and big specimens are likely to be from elsewhere. However in Sai Kung - you can eat vegetarian if you prefer - a trim and tasty breakfast at Jaspas - lunch at Sri Lankan AJs and afternoon tea at a cafe that sells sublime mango jam, Let's Jam.

There are some areas where I needed to grab onto trees and then other areas with a nice path. We hiked for a good while and ended up at a cool area where we can swim. You can also climb the rocks and jump off of the top into the pool of water. The jump isn't that high, it was just exciting to find a great spot. When we were there, there were locals there just chillin and having a picnic. After a while, we hiked out and down to the beach. The views along the way were breathtaking. Once you get to the beach, it's is pretty cool. The fishing village has fresh seafood and you can pick the fish you want to eat before they cook it for you. It's definitely a day long adventure so plan ahead. Also, I recommend to bring, good sneakers, swim suit, water and a camera. Go see Sai Kung for yourself!"

You can see many dogs, a floating sea food market and also if you have time (2 hours), can take a boat tour (50 Hkd) to the island around Sai Kung with the option to stay in the island for the time that you prefer."

A dog lovers Haven, Sai Kung has plenty to offer. There are boats which take you to different islands and villages near Sai Kung which is an added bonus. We took 1A from Dundas Street in Mong Kok and before we knew it we were in Sai Kung. This was by far one of the best impromptu plans ever!"

This is a good break from the bustling, noisy Hong Kong; I took the small yellow bus 1A from Dundas St in Mong Kok, only HK$15 each way, 40 minutes ride to Sai Kung.Its a fishing village with good seafood restaurants along the harbour front, though not that cheap and a bit touristy. Many offer a set menu from HK$300 / \u00a325 plus. Its cheaper to go a couple of streets inland and eat with the locals. I visited Sushi Tenku and had a great set lunch for HK$100 / \u00a38.The village has a similar feel to Stanley or Aberdeen on the HK island south side. Shopping is less good though. Quite a few expats stay here as they get a bigger flat/living space and quieter, cleaner living environment than in central Kowloon.There are boat trips to the out-lying islands. A nice day trip."

Sai Kung is just that \u2013 a fishing village nestled in the Sai Kung peninsula in the New Territories of the north-east. The history of this village dates back to the year 1400 and despite all the new developments in Hong Kong Sai Kung retains its rural character. The MTR has not yet made its debut here. So, to reach Sai Kung your last MTR stop is Diamond Hill and from there you take the bus. Sea food eateries are the life line of this place and the choice is enormous and here you can choose your fish and get them cooked to your liking. The promenade is a great place to meander. For hikers Sai Kung is a delight and they can lose themselves to the charms of the Sai Kung Volcanic Rock Region."

We took a group down to one of the beaches right off the pier and rented kayaks for the day. We hopped around islands with our kayaks all day, and it was perfect!! The water is clean and clear, and the white sand beaches are so fun to hang out on. There are even some islands you can go into and climb the trails! The pier was clean and filled with a lot of dogs (with owners of course). We did spot a feral cow!There were a lot of good food choices! We had some thai food that was out of this world. Unfortunately I don't remember the name. It was right by the bus stop down a little alley on the right. Amazing food. The overall atmosphere of Sai Kung is very relaxed and a great place for outdoor fun!"

Reverse directions when returning. And hold on tight because as soon as the bus door closes the driver will take you on mad rush to Sai Kung. We had been either on Hong Kong island or Tsim Sha Tsui for a few days and it was so refreshing to be taken away to the 'country side'. Plenty of places to eat either along the Sai Kung promenade or a through the village. There is even the global fast food chains such as McDonalds. You can choose your fresh seafood and have it cooked for you. You can buy fresh seafood from all the vendors along the pier. They are on their boats while you on the promenade and exchange of goods and money is via a pole with a net. Plenty of dried seafood to purchase. Some samples to eat as well. Very family oriented and pet friendly. A pleasure to have visited."

A 1-kg Red Lobster goes for HK$500 (about US$60) and you will be spoilt by all the choices available including scallops, geoduck, clams, crabs, garoupas and my fav lobsters.

We caught a cab out to some spot in the middle of nowhere from where we hiked down to Ham Tin beach, enjoying the beautiful views along the way. Our reward was a refreshing cool beer and some lunch. The restaurant had a fence running through it. Apparently they had built a little too far down the beach on to what is classified as state land. The what would have been an attractive sun deck is now behind wire netting which seems like a pretty pointless exercise of bureaucratic power.After lunch we hiked up the stream to the waterfall where the more adventurous of my children jumped in. A great photo opportunity. Next we took the trail to Tai Long Sai Wan beach and enjoyed more glorious views. After another refreshing beer we took a boat to Sai Kung. I'd normally say this is the best way to do it but the heavens opened and our front seat vantage point proved a very exposed place to sit.At Sai Kung we watched the shoppers haggle with the fishermen to buy their catch. I couldn't even tell what some of the catch was. We finally selected a sea food restaurant (whose name I forget) and had the same problem. After photographing the exotic sea life in the tanks we had to choose our dinner but didn't know what it was. Fortunately we just had to point and the waitress recommended a cooking style for each of our purchases. She made good choices because dinner was fantastic - a perfect end to a great day."

It was suggested to me by a friend who visits Hong Kong regularly and I was so pleased that I followed up on his suggestion. Getting to Sai Kung was incredibly easy. Just take the MTR to Diamond Hill and change to a number 92 bus and stay on all the way. The 92 bus route is a lovely scenic ride too (as long as you sit upstairs). Sai Kung itself has a selection of seafood restaurants with an amazing array of delicacies from which to choose. The promenade is a pleasant stroll and the small old town is also worth a brief wander - it won't take you long. It's one of those places that doesn't appear in the guide books and. I'm glad but give it a go (by public transport) and you'll be glad you did."

No tall building, no big shopping mall, not much people in weekday (be aware that there will be many on weekend). You can expect big blue sky, great sea view, fishing at the pier, BBQ at the beach, snorkeling, diving, hiking, picnic etc. etc. Sai Kung is a place that you can go a hundred times but still fun to go for the hundred and one time. At Sai Kung center near the pier, there are some fishermen selling fresh fishes on boats and you can see how they manage good to sell on floating boat~! Some boatmen near the pier would sell the ticket to islands nearby. They offer very reasonable price to many beautiful islands such as Sharp Island and Half Moon Bay. Really good views but do more research before going to those islands. Some may not offer toilet facility. Besides the Sai Kung center, the BBQ sites, hiking area, beaches, picnic sites etc. are also great to good. I love Sai Kung very much. This place is a escape from Hong Kong. Hong Kong break."

There are plenty of shops to look in and restaurants and bars to take a break in. Walk along the jetty and watch locals selling live fish from there little boats tied alongside.

The rest of the afternoon, you can spend just walking on the promenade, watching Hong Kong-ers playing with their pups (there are a lot of poodles on this island!) or fishermen peddling their catch. It's a very local scene here, with photography buffs, sporty types and families enjoying a weekend by the sea. Would have liked to take a hike and then swim, but the day was overcast.

Had lunch at one of the seafront restaurants and then took a boat across to Sharp Island. There is no need to go with one of the touts there is a regular ferry which cost HK$4 return. The island there is very small but a nice walk around and you can cross the tombolo when the tide permits to another small island very pretty. When we got back across all the local fishermen were bringing their catch in and selling on the front. Great day would certainly recommend it."

Most people think of Hong Kong as one large city, but as seen from the plane flying into Hong Kong Airport the island is large and along with the surrounding \"old-territories\" some truly vast amounts of undeveloped open space. What catches your eye is the myriad of small sea harbours that face the sea. Sai Kung is one such area. Connections from Hong Kong are a bit tricky, but all doable and fun. The MTR gets you on your way with a few quick changes and then you jump on one of the many small buses that will take you out to Sai Kung. Sai Kung itself is a small fishing village with lots of small shops and restaurants, but what makes it so lovely is the atmosphere, views and smells of the sea. The Hong Kong Scout Association has a large Leadership Outdoor Training Centre located across the bay. From there trails cut up and around the peninsula making it possible to do a pretty neat trek from Sai Kung itself."

Sai Kung is a great contrast to the international frenetic activity in the city, a small town on the seafront with a thriving fishing community and some spectacular harbour front seafood restaurants. It also has some interesting quiet backstreets to explore. Sai Kung is the gateway town to some large areas of natural beauty but on my short trip I was only able to visit the town. I had a decent plate of scallops and vegatables for lunch (difficult to have a great seafood meal when you're eating alone) and then took a different bus back to Diamond Hill MTR and into the Kowloon madness once more.

The meat should not stick to the shell. It was beautifully cooked, but there was that feeling that we had been tricked into thinking we were going to eat the seafood out of the tank.

None of which appealed to us as they seemed to be kind of shabby and uninviting. A tout handed me a sheet promoting a seafood set lunch. At HK $458 (US $55) per person we thought it is a bit steep in a harbor village. As we walked around it became obvious that McDonald's and Pizza Hut were doing great judging by the number of people eating there. Bottom line: You can get to Sai Kung by taking the MTR (train) from Tai Wai to the end of the line and then the 99 Bus. Or you can go to Sha Tin and then take the 299 bus to Sai Kung but this may take longer. "

Once you get off the bus, you will see the pier right in front of you. People are lined up bargaining along the wharf because the boat people are down there selling there fresh seafood. Make sure if you buy seafood and bring to a restaurant ask them how much they will charge extra for bring stuff in. Shop around if you have to.

There is also a nice collection of western style restaurants spread around the city, including classics like Jaspa's on Sha Tsui Path. There is also good Thai food in Sai Kung as well as plenty of western bars and even a couple of good coffee shops.The main activities in Sai Kung include spending time on the promenade, taking junk boat trips to the smaller outer islands as well as the relatively new Geo Park tour. However, our favourite activity is simply watching open seafood market which lines the piers along the promenade. All matter of seafood seems to be available and being sold by the seafood sellers docked in boats along the piers. It\u2019s a lively, hygienic and very photogenic environment, making it a genuinely fun place to visit.Other things to do in Sai Kung include a visit to the nicely restored Tin Hau Temple in the town center as well as a handful of other Tin Hau temples spread out in the Sai Kung area. The old town center, offers a bit of a labyrinth of narrow ally streets and make a fun area to explore. Additionally, in the Sai Kung area there are some nice beaches and country parks for hiking as well as access to a public golf course. Overall, Sai Kung is a great area to explore, dine and spend time while visiting Hong Kong. Similar but more rustic than Stanley on Hong Kong Island, Sai Kung is one of the best locations to just relax and enjoy a seaside environment when you tire of the noise and crowds of the city."

The waterfront has many wonderful seafood restaurants serving absolutely delicious freshly prepared seafood at very reasonable prices. A walk along the waterfront is fascinating and great to watch the local people buying their fresh seafood supplies from many boats moored to the docks. The beaches in this area are beautifully clean and many water sport activities are available for the adventurous at heart. We will definately spend longer here on our next visit."

It has a very small town with many shops and many good restaurants of different cuisines. You can get to Sai Kung by many buses and also by minibuses. It is normally about half an hour ride to get there. You can go to many small islands in Hong Kong from there as well. The seafood market is an eye opener. You can pick and choose live seafood and they will prepare it for you to your liking. However it is important to ask them the price beforehand to avoid confrontation. In all it is a place with many interesting local charm."

We lunched at a great restaurant about 10 minutes walk from the taxi rank (turn left when you get to the water) ...I can't recall the name but its just past BBQ King. Great seafood meal including crab and prawns and a few beers for 4 adults and cost $Aus100.We organised for a boat to take us around the small islands for about half an hour but you could swim, go for a longer boat ride, rent kayaks, go fishing.

Sai Kung town, which now has a population of about 13,000 was a small undeveloped fishing village until the fishing industry declined in the 1970\u2019s and many fishermen moved into other businesses such as fish farming, eco tourism and seafood restaurants. A major reclamation project between 1978 and 1993 led to subsequent development of new buildings, shops, promenade, piers, public swimming pool and other facilities. Improvements to roads and public transport have seen the town grow to become a commuter town popular with ex-pats but the town still retains much of its old charm and fishing village atmosphere. The colourful harbour is always a hive of activity and sampans line the promenade selling catches of seafood direct to the public and local seafood restaurants.The plan was to have lunch at one of the many fish restaurants along the promenade, where you can choose your own fish from the tanks, or even direct from the fishermen, then discuss with the waiters how you would like your choices cooked.

Don't worry; they won't leave you there. This is by far my favorite thing to do in HK. If you have a minute to leave the city, or you're just searching for some beach relaxation, this is the place.

I was staying in Clearwater Bay, so the trip to Sai Kung was only 20 minutes, but it's still a fascinating place to visit, even from central Hong Kong. A great day in HK!"

The town is a quaint little town with lots of seafood restaurants, a pier where fishermen sell fresh seafood and a waterfront that's perfect for a sunset stroll.And just 20 minutes away, is the Country Park, which is a big playground for the nature lovers. It's so quiet that you can hear all the birds, crickets and insects. Carabaos walk freely in the park roads. Air is fresh and the pace is slow. I stayed with one of the residents inside the park, and I took long walks along the park roads, visit small little ancient villages that are hidden well inside the park, get to the trails that lead to beautiful shorelines. Even if it's quite secluded, it's very much accessible with buses plying the major park roads and is safe as it is monitored closely by rangers. The park in general is very clean and well maintained.There are a lot of things to do and places to see in Sai Kung, outside of the usual town centre visit. The country park alone has a lot of places to see, and the Geopark is not too miss. Stay at least one night to enjoy the place. Walk or travel by land, instead of the usual island hopping by boat."

It can be crowded at the weekends due to visitors, from other parts of Hong Kong, coming for the 'famous' seafood, and so this can affect the traffic and crowds. The weekdays are much better and mainly serves the local population (local and expat).There is more to see and do than just seafood... Walk around the old Sai Kung Village and see an old man who still practices the art of 'metal bashing', take a junk to the many adjacent islands (do bargain on price), go to 'Harrods\" (as the locals call it) which is an everything shop for all kinds of goods (especially plastic ones from China) or the everything stationary shop (around the central square), eat at the al fresco dining places around the square (e.g. Ali Oli Bakery), and of course the seafood restaurants along the waterfront (Tung Kee for a well-priced set menu, or Loaf On- the 1 star Michelin for a la carte). There are newer shops opening up which serve a more expat population e.g Babushka for children's organic clothes, organic furniture shop Tree next door to an organic vegetable shop, and good steak at Anthony's Ranch or huge pizzas at Paisanos Pizza.A great place to walk around and feel the local Hong Kong."

If you can spare the time during a stay in Hong Kong, consider a day in Sai Kung, it\u2019s an authentic little fishing town (too big to call it a village) in the North East of the New Territories. We did, and found the change of scene and pace almost exciting. We (old folk!) enjoyed the adventure, and swiping our Octopus Passes with aplomb on both the MRT and the Mini Bus.We researched this little side trip on the web before we went to Hong Kong, and to summarize how we get there; we took the MTR to Choi Hung Station, and from outside exit C of that station we took the Green Mini Bus right to Sai Kung town centre. The 30 minute bus ride through suburban and rural New Territories was almost reason enough for the trip on its own. The colourful harbour in Sai Kung was a hive of activity and sampans lined the promenade selling catches of seafood direct to the public and to the local seafood restaurants. I\u2019ve never seen such a variety of exotic sea creatures caught at one time by one little boat!Across from the harbour, are the restaurants with their own array of tanks with their menu swimming or crawling about on display. Some of these are high class places and are a bit expensive, but cheaper places can be found in streets further back from the harbour. The seafood is obviously fresh, but it was difficult for us (westerners) to know what everything was, and what to order, so we took a stab at it so to speak! It was all very tasty, but it was a struggle for me at least to deal with heads, bones, fins, and claws etc., that\u2019s the way it\u2019s done here. My wife managed a lot better than I.You can also take Sampan trips to the nearby islands out in the bay, lots of boat owners touting trips. We didn\u2019t look into that, but I think you can cherry-pick just where you want to go, for reasonable prices I am told. A memorable day out we would recommend."

It's where the Hong Kongese go to get their wedding photos taken and have a BBQ at the weekend. Lush green scenery, rocky beaches, fishing villages and emerald isles dotting the choppy waters. Gets a bit chokka at the weekends though, so recommend visiting in the week if you have that luxury."

            "review": "A seaside town in transition. This is a seaside place on the east side of Hong Kong and away from the main public transport routes. We went there on a Saturday when it was very crowded with lots of people (often showing off their dogs) were walking up and down the promenade. There are seafood restaurants along the front and fishermen at the quayside sell their wares directly from their boats to locals. A wide spectrum of fruits of the sea is available including crayfish, crabs and other kinds of fish with gills. You can walk a mile or more on the promenade and look out at the nearby islands and, if you want, take a boat trip to a golf course on one or simply have a ride to another. During the week, however, the place is much quieter and in squares away from the sea front there are ex-patriots eating western food, reading newspapers and gossiping. There is an English-language bookshop and there are Italian restaurants and bakeries as well. The place is in transition because, as the border with mainland China opens ever wider, it seems likely that the ex-patriot enclaves will be swallowed up by incomers bringing traditional Chinese culture.You can tell that I am a European and value the relaxed cafe culture and hope it survives."

Sai Kung isn't awful, but there are many better destinations in Hong Kong.On the positive side, it's fairly quiet (compared to central Hong Kong) but there's still usually large crowds of tourists. It takes a long time to get to (you could get to Lantau from Central in less time) and because there's no MTR, you're somewhat at the mercy of traffic.In Sai Kung there are a lot of seafood restaurants, but not really much else. It's a popular place to get a junk boat ride from, but again, you could do so in Victoria Harbour, so that in itself isn't a very good reason to visit.It's probably quite a nice place to live, and it does have its passionate defenders, but as a tourist destination, it's not anything special."

Kau Sai Chou Public Golf Club House Our Favorite!- My wife and I were pleasantly surprised that one does not have to play golf to enjoy a nice snack and drink at their spectacular Club House overlooking the gorgeous golf course by the sea!- The 15min boat ride in the scenic and calm harbor is a treat itself!-\u00a0We had a relaxing brunch and drinks on the 2nd story terrace watching people happily playing on the vast, magnificent course by the water! Life is beautiful indeed!\u00a0- They have good foods on both Chinese and western menu. The price is reasonable, starting HK$38 [US$5] for a simple dish upwards to various combos and buffet; beer and wine at HK$30. \u00a0The cost of the boat ride is HK$35-45pp Round Trip. \u00a0NOTES:- At the Club's own pier, just ask the Club's pier staff about the ride, since there is NO PROMINENT sign about the trip to the club house, even though the bulletin board at the pier does post menus and the boat fare.\u00a0One can simply get on the boat to the Club, where one must buy a ticket for the round trip fare to return.- Although I normally use 2 walking canes to get around, with the help of their friendly crew, I had no problem getting on/off their good size boat. Since there are steps at the loading area leading to the boat, it is not wheelchair friendly, however, unfortunately. Well, I am not sure, if they could provide a portable ramp for that, though.2. BOAT RIDEs to GEOPARK- There are a number of different boat rides to various part of the famous Geopark islands complex, which is reportedly fun and highly educational. \u00a0Unfortunately, we did NOT have enough time that day to explore the Geopark. Well, maybe next time.3. SEAFOOD BOATS and RESTAURANTS- It's a pleasure to walk along the pier to check out the restaurants, one after the other, all of which have huge tanks in front, full of live fishes, clams, geoducks, shrimps, even horseshoe crabs...! A sight to behold! It's also fun to check out the small boats below the pier, full of live seafoods! Incredibly, most of them are IMPORTS and NOT local fresh catches! A seafood diner at one of those restaurants is highly recommended! In town, near the pier, there are a couple of western restaurants, too, as well as some bars, which offer happy hours (5-9).Peterskis, Feb 2012"

Sai Kung is a fishing town, you will see people buying fresh fish etc from local fishermen and boats along the pier. One special history about Sai Kung is the \"Ding Houses.\" The \"Dings\" are male descendents of aboringinal Hong Kong people who live on the island before the British took over as a colony. The Hong Kong government gave \"the Dings\" (not the daughters) free land to build houses, only three storey tall, 700 sq ft per floor to preserve the rural scenery of Sai Kung. Many Hong Kong residents and westerners bought or rent \"ding houses.\" Look for the \"ding houses\" when you visit Sai Kung to relive this surprisngly untold histroy of Hong Kong."

You can get the restaurants along the waterfront to cook it for you immediately and it will be so delicious! Before or after your meal walk along the pier and watch the locals sell fresh catch from the sea right out of their boats. (Makes you wish you had a kitchen in HK so you can bring something home.)"

We went to Sai Kung as an afterthoughtWe took the subway to Diamond Head and the bus (i think it was 92) to Sai KungIt took atleast an hour to get there and(being november) it was dark when we got there - but the bus station is right on the waterfront so its very convenient.After we arrived we discovered that there are other things to do there - like go to the marine park and see the coastline and rocks - but as we were there for only a short time we just ate dinner.We saw a few people selling fresh seafood right off their boats then we walked down the waterfront past all the restaurants. We were there around 5 so it wasn't very busy yet but it gets pretty packed.We were handed a number of leaflets and picked one where we could choose 4 out of 10 dishes. Other patrons were actually picked their dinner from the numerous tanks, of course not speaking the language that might have been difficult.We paid about $380 for a fish, lobster and pasta, clams and vermicelli, bok choi and some crab with onions and a beer.The next door table paid about $1900, there were two people and they ordered one of the king crabs. I didn't see anything else so i'm not sure if they got other dishes with that. From another restaurant I saw that might be the going rate for crabs that size - they were enormous.I would recommend going to see other things in the area and then eating dinner at the waterfront and taking the bus back after dinner.Apparently you can get off at another subway stop(the stop after diamond head) but it was easier for us just to ride the full route."

Sai Kung can be reached by using the 92 bus from Diamond Hill MTR Station. Alternatively there are many green public mini-buses which go there from Choi Hung.Sai Kung is a fishing village located in the New Territories. It is surrounded by beautiful unspoilt countryside and has some lovely country walks available nearby. Visitors can hire a small boat to take them out to one of the islands. We went out to a lovely small island with an amazing beach. The kids loved riding in the boat as well as playing on the beach. Prices for these boats are negotiable and depend quite a lot on your bargaining skills but they are generally quite reasonable and cheap.Sai Kung village itself has many shops and restaurants. Visitors should bear in mind that Sai Kung is not really a touristy place: it is somewhere that locals and ex-pats visit and so a lot of the shops are geared towards them and their needs. However, many of the restaurants serve fresh seafood and have an incredible range of seafood swimming in tanks outside. There is a very nice public swimming pool in Sai Kung town centre that is reasonably priced and is clean and well maintained.Overall, Sai Kung is somewhere I would recommend to visitors. There are boat trips, country walks, interesting shops, and restaurants serving delicious locally-caught seafood. We went twice with two small children and they both loved it so families with small kids should not feel put off."

It has beautiful beaches e.g. Hap Mun bay which are easily reached by a small sampan from the public pier at around 20-25HK$- it is quite full on Sundays. Trio beach is my favorite and you can walk here or take a sampan from Pak Sha Wan pier, 5 min before you get to Sai Kung and it costs 10 HK$.Sai Kung Country park is an amazing day out with the best beaches in Hong Kong - but you have to hike there and you need to get a bus into the country park or take a taxi (Sai wan) to the start of the hike. Tai Long Wan is fantastic (also for surfers) and the scenic hike takes about 2 hours with kids - lots of little restaurants along the way. If you get tired just stay at Sai Wan beach which you reach in about 45 min. On weekends it is possible to book a speedboat back at the last restaurant before you get to Tai Long Wan beach - usually 100 HK$ per person but book as soon as you get there if you want this option as the boat tend to fill up quickly.Sai Kung has fantastic seafood restaurants situated right on the seafront facing the habour and these restaurants are quite busy on weekends where all the Chinese Hong kong recidents and expats escape to this lovely spot. Sai kung has lots of other types of restaurants as well so it caters for everybody. A stroll through the old town (near the temple) is a special experience and the narrow streets are cosy and has lots of little interesting shops. Lions park is situated right before you enter Sai Kung and this is a lovely botanic garden where the kids can run around and play and if you are up for a beautiful scenic walk to a great beach it is only 45 min walk. Furthermore, Saturday morning you can buy organic vegetables here and a fair price.Sai Kung has one of the best walks along the seafront and on weekends (and sometimes during the week) you can buy seafood straight from the fishing boats along here. At the end of the pier (500 meters) you can rent kayaks, windsurfing equipment etc quite cheap. Sunday is dog-lovers day in Sai Kung and the seafront is full of dogs running around (or in strollers and dressed up!).Most people choose not to go to Sai Kung because it seems to be far away but it is actually quite easy. Get the red minibus from Dundas street in Mongkok (right at the end of ladies market) and you are in Sai Kung within 20-25 min. To go back jump on the same bus from the stadium in Sai Kung about every 20 min :) If you go via Choi Hung (green line on MTR) take exit C2 and the green minibus to Sai Kung is right there, bus 1a. Go to the last stop on route and you are dropped of at the pier in Sai Kung. From Hang Hau (purple line on MTR) take exit B and the green minibus to Sai Kung is 101 situated in the center lane of the bus station :) Last stop is Sai Kung pier.Sai kung square has 4-5 great restaurants and there is a small playground where the kids can play while the parents enjoy the dinner - there is also a basket ball court right there."

Not many tourists come here but ex-pats and locals love this relaxing fishing village with the long seaside promenade, seafood restaurants and wine bars. This is an excellent place to visit to get away from the chaos and business of greater Hong Kong and Kowloon. Its a bit like Stanley but not at all touristy and with much less tourist crowd, this is a get-away for locals and ex-pats. The promenade bars (Sai Sai is my favorite) are nice and the local fishermen selling their live fish, shellfish and other exotic things from the sea to local buyers are very interesting to watch and photograph. Sampan boats can be rented, cheaper than in Aberdeen, to take you to Sharp island or other nearby places. There is good seafood on the promenade. Inside the town area, 2-3 minutes walk, you can find good Thai Food, European Bistro restaurants as well as local restaurants. Of course there is a McDonalds and Starbucks as well if you're keen on comfort foods. Also, for hikers, Sai Kung has some nice opportunities for spending a day out in nature.Lastly, Sai Kung is well connected to much of HK, particularly Kowloon area by local bus transportation. We highly rate Sai Kung and recommend it to visitors when they have had a enough of the city and need a break from the crowds, noise and chaos. Its a paradise in this regard."
