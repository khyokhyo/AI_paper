The sushi for 2 plus 2 mini bottles of champagne deal was nice as a snack there -approx \u00a318, the champagne was 'Chandon' which was surprisingly nice!"

Their versions of port are probably prettier than this one. The port in Barcelona is way better and nicer looking, more activities to do and better shops.Puerto Madero is not a must see. If you are in the area, you can check it out. It gets windy. Dress warm. I still give it 3 points because it is a safe place to walk around. There are a lot of navy police in the area to guard visitors'' safety.Puerto Madero is a tourist trap with a lot of expensive restaurants. The only inexpensive eats are fast food restaurants."

Left unattended for year, after the harbor moved to its new location, the old warehouses lining the harbour had fallen in ruin. The old eyesore was turned into a tourist attraction where the old warehouses were rehabilitated and put to use as restaurants, offices, boutiques and the like. A safe, wonderful area for a stroll and a meal at just about any time for lunch and dinner, the area has been developed tremendously in the last ten years from my last visit. What is new is the far bank, which before only contained the Hilton Hotel, sitting lonely away from the action on the opposite bank, is now chuck full of new buildings. This area has stunning contemporary architecture where office buildings mix with apartment buildings and mix use commercial such as restaurants, shops, offices, etc. It became a vibrant, safe and luxurious neighborhood of BA. Highly recommended for locals and tourists alike. When here, one can do worse than schedule a dinner at the most famous restaurant and temple of steak, Cabana Las Lilas. Many other restaurant options abound. There are two old sailing ships that can be visited as well. Perhaps the best is watching people as on weekends particularly BA families use this area as a strolling place in addition to wonderful prolonged lunches at any of the many restaurants."

It is a regenerated dockside area, very pleasant and lovely for a stroll in the evening with some interesting bridges and old ships along the river. Like most modern regenerated dockside areas they tend to lack the particular characteristics of the country or city you are in due to generic hotel, food and shop chains, but we did find some real gems in this area that made us feel very much in Argentina. We found this area a good place to stay and it was just a few minutes walk to the pink palace."

Geographically distributed along the whole area are loading cranes to keep the atmosphere of the old use of the river, and one of the iconic ships of the Argentinian Navy, the Uruguay, is open to visit. A very niceplace for a stroll and also for exercising."

It is now a trendy place with restaurants and boutique hotels. We saw a tango show at the Faena Hotel and had a wonderful evening in the area. It is also a place where pickpockets abound. Despite our world traveling, we were taken by a threesome that apparently sprayed something in the are behind us that resembled bird droppings, then appeared to help us try to 'clean up' offering a water bottle and tissues, all the while they picked our pockets and backpacks of pesos, a wallet and a cell phone. Dumb mistake on our part to have missed their intentions, as we had heard that this area could be dangerous for the very reason that this incident occurred. It put a damper on our last day here."

So, on one side of the water is an old industrial and warehouse area -- all red brick -- that was abandoned for many years until entrepreneurs converted the old buildings into chic restaurants and apartments. Across the water is a glass and steel high rise quarter used primarily for offices, but also with waterfront shops and cafes (and expensive condos). It's a very linear area, good for long walks, stretching from san Telmo in the South to Microcentro (and beyond) in the North. I have an apartment in san Telmo, so it's a pleasant area to walk in on nice days. The restaurants are all expensive, so I don't frequent them. But I can see that they would appeal to tourists. Rich business people take clients to them. The famous footbridge, puente de la mujer, is here along with two old decommissioned masted warships that serve as floating museums. Worth a tourist visit, but not really representative of Buenos Aires in general."

This reclaimed port has a great artsy atmosphere and it's a very nice, safe place for tourists. We capped our day by taking an evening Gondola ride around the port, with wine in hand and great local appetizers, the evening could not have been more romantic. It is definitely a must go place when you are in Buenos Aires. We would certainly go back when we return to Buenos Aires again."

Living here is very pleasant, no traffic jams, broad streets and the most safe place in Buenos Aires, where the local Navy police take care of business. On Sundays this turns into the Coney Island of the people, with families coming from all over to hang out in what Cubans call the Malecon (walkboard) bu the river. There are hundreds of vendors there to placate these hungry hordes.This section of town is not cheap in any way. Everything is more expensive here, save Farma City or Jumbo, which have prices like other stores.The restaurants at the entrance are expensive, no question about it. Some are very good, some not.This is not like Recoleta, where you can admire old buildings, walk a few blocks and find a nice cozy place to eat. This is like Aventura (Miami) in Argentina. Very new.

The place is an ideal balance between old and new with enough flair to make one forget that this is, after all, a country with great discrepancies andeconomic problems.If Madero was (in)famous for designing a port that had to be abandoned, the architects that planned the renovation should be given the chance to have the area named after them.

The water is dirty, apart from a few old boats there isn't a lot to see.

However in recent years it has been significantly gentrified and now contains an array of high end restaurants in addition to a large nature open nature area. I visited with my partner in December 2015. It reminded me a lot of the docklands area in Liverpool. To be honest the only thing I found exceptional about it was the price of our very average lunch. I don't think it's a 'must visit' for anyone in buenos aires."

It even has its own police force giving it a very safe feel.Nearby ( walking distance ) is the Presidential Palace - affectionately known as the Pink Palace or\u00a0Casa Rosada. The President only uses this building as an office; and resides elsewhere. The building itself looked in good repair, but the grounds on one side looked in a poor state - as shown in a photo here.The building has a balcony famous for Presidential speeches. In 1946 a working class hero President Peron - came to power, and made speeches here. He was accompanied by his wife Maria Eva Duarte. She was affectionately known a s Evita; and she became President after the death of her husband. Still today she is much loved and her pictures can be seen on the sides of buildings around the city.The balcony was also used in 1982 to announce war against the UK over the Falkland Islands.\u00a0In front of the Palace is Plaza de Mayo ( May Square ). Argentina\u2019s turbulent history records many events taking place here.\u00a0 For example :- In the early 1980s - mothers protested to the military dictatorship about the disappearance of huge numbers of their children.\u00a0 Many still unaccounted for today. In 2001 thousands of people gathered in the plaza & banged pots and pans to protest about the devaluation of their savings. The protests became violent and people were killed here. In 2012 - people gathered to protest about the suspicious death of their federal prosecutor, Alberto Nisman.Across the square is the Metropolitan Cathedral of the former Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio, now better known as Pope Francis 1.\u00a0 One of the most important religious buildings in Argentina. It has a sumptuous interior, and the high alter has amazing carvings & sculptures. There are lots of shrines and monuments throughout the building.Streets lead off the Plaza into the city centre, which is much like any city centre the world over - lots of shops and stores - with the obvious slant on Argentinian products and styles. Good for the shopaholics !Visit the cemetery to see the grave of Eva Peron - much loved and revered past President.. There is however, some dispute whether she is actually there, in the family Duarte tomb. Much of the cemetery has mausoleum\u2019s to hold all family coffins & many can be viewed through the glass fronts of the buildings. Coffins in pristine condition - located on rack upon rack of the dead.Visit some poorer areas of the city - where people live in quite difficult conditions and eked out a living selling their wares. Many buildings in the area are brightly coloured.Argentina is famous for its \u201ctango dancers\u201d, and around the city are street entertainers, dressed to \u201ctango\u201d, and keen to have you pose with them for photos - which you were then charged for.\u00a0 Another way to earn a peso and make a living.Take an organised day trip out into the country & visit an Estancia ( a farm ). Go horse riding on the Pampas with the Gauchos. An excellent & worthwhile trip - but it is a long day."

Ships had to unloaded by small boats. In the late 1880's Puerto Madero was partially inagurated. A complicated design, with four closed docks in line built on reclaimed land. At the beginning it worked well, but ships grew in size and the port became obsolete. When the third port of B.A. was inaugurated, Puerto Madero started to lose traffic and in the 1980's it was a cemetery for old ships. In the 90's the city of Buenos Aires and the real state developers teamed-up and a whole new neighborhood was created. It's residential, a business area, there's a yatch port, a museum ship, a beautiful pedestrian bridge, two embassies, a university, three hotels and many restaurants to chose from. People can walk 2.5 miles from from North to South and last but not least, all the way South there's a floating casino.The old warehouses were fully renovated, where we had silos and mills there are tall condominiums and...where on earth is the river?

A mix of both trendy, noisy establishments, as well as some fine restaurants, focussed on Argentna's famous steak.Given their fondness for later evening meals, some of the locals refereed to themselves as Vampires. They don't like to feed until around 9 or 10 pm. This may explain the lack of people we saw around us and inside the establishments as wondered down the old red building side of Puerto Madero, across the bridge and then back down the other side.We saw many fine menus, but the lack of patrons put us off. If only we had known more about the local customs. Perhaps an afternoon nap may have held us in good stead for a late night meal."

These include Parolaccia, Katrine, and La Cabana de las Lilas. The ultra-luxurious Hotel Faena, the home of the famous Rojo Tango show, is also located in this area.

Thus second time we were there for lunch and after having lunch in one of the many restaurants there we walked throughout the Puerto, had ice cream and enjoy the weather. We spent there around 4 hours but could have been 6 easily, between the museums, coffee places, parks and restaurants Puerto Madero is the perfect place to spend a Saturday afternoon in Buenos Aires"

A perfect place yo have a coffee while you look out at the inner waterway, the marina or the bridge which is said to be stylistically shaped like a woman dancing the tango. This is a relaxed neighbourhood which is easy to walk around although seeing all of it would take some time. This is not an exciting place not does it have a lot of history. But it is great for a relaxing walk and a good meal."

You can walk, jog o run if you want alonside the river, or if you prefer you can sit down and read a book while you see the river in front of you. You will see a lot of people during the daytime so its a pretty safe area all the time, specially during the daytime.You have a lot of places to go and eat or have a coffee. There is also a casino, called \"El casino flotante\", and its a boat that is a casino. If you wanna go to a restaurant in Puerto Madero, you have a couple of good choices, but everything is way more expensive because of the area. So you can go to another restaurant and eat better and cheaper.You can go also to the cinema, drink mate sitting in a park bench or go to the casino. I think its a must for all the travellers that are coming for the first time to visit BA."

Last week I reported to you on a jogging trail in Recoleta / Palermo along the woods of Palermo \u201cBosques de Palermo\u201d. I would like in this report to talk about Jogging in \u201cPuerto Madero\u201d. Puerto Madero is a new, elegant and very modern Barrio of Buenos Aires. There are several jogging options, I like two of them. One is relatively short while the other is long. I will review the short route in this note, the one I call the \u201cdocks route\u201d. As I did in my earlier review, I will also mention the points of interest you will see along the route.If you are staying in Puerto Madero, you can join this route at any point suitable for you, as described below. If you are coming from somewhere else in town to jog in Puerto Madero, I would recommend you enter Puerto Madero via \u201cAvenida C\u00f3rdoba\u201d which turns into \u201cAvenida Cecilia Grierson\u201d in Puerto Madero or via \u201cAvenida Belgrano\u201d which turns into \u201cAvenida Azucena Villaflor\u201d in Puerto Madero. These two entrances allow you to easily join the docks jogging route. You will need your map now to mark the route.This is just over 4 km route around the first three of Puerto Madero docks. One can start at any point, but let us assume you are coming via \u201cAvenida C\u00f3rdoba\u201d so you start at its intersection with \u201cAvenida Alicia Moreau de Justo\u201d. Run south alongside the docks on \u201cJuana Manuela Gorriti\u201d street. You will see on your right the famous grill house \u201cSottovoce\u201d and just before you come to the end of the first dock there is another good grill house \u201cCaba\u00f1a Las Lilas\u201d. Continue south along the second dock and about half way through it you will see the \u201cMuseo Fragata Sarmiento\u201d which is worth visiting on another day. Along the second dock you will continue to see restaurants, but perhaps of a less caliber than the two I mentioned above. As you go from the second to the third dock, you will cross \u201cAvenida Belgrano\u201d which would be your starting point if you entered Puerto Madero via \u201cAvenida Belgrano\u201d. As you run along the third dock the \u201cCatholic university of Buenos Aires\u201d will be on your right. The third dock finishes at \u201cAvenida Estados Unidos\u201d or \u201cAvenida Rosario Vera Pe\u00f1aloza\u201d in Puerto Madero and that is where you cross the docks and turn around running north on \u201cPierina Dealessi\u201d street . On that side is the \u201cHotel Madero\u201d which is very close to the intersection of \u201cAvenida Rosario Vera Pe\u00f1aloza\u201d and \u201cPierina Dealessi\u201d street. If you are staying at that hotel, you would start the route there. As you finish the third dock and cross \u201cAvenida Azucena Villaflor\u201d, look to the right and see the exclusive \u201cTorres Le Parc\u201d apartment building towers. If you are following the news, you will recognize it as the place where Prosecutor \u201cAlberto Nisman\u201d was found dead earlier this year. As you reach about half way through this dock, you will see the famous bridge \u201cPuente de la Mujer\u201d which has the shape of a lady\u2019s figure. You would have seen the bridge on your way south, but the figure of the lady is better seen from this side. As you finish the second dock, you will see the Hilton Hotel, Buenos Aires on your right side. [This would be your starting point on this route if you are staying at the Hilton]. Continue north along the first dock and about half way through it, you will see on the left [in the canal] the Buenos Aires Yacht club. You will have just passed the Yacht club admin building on your right. There will also be many elegant caf\u00e9s and small restaurants on your right. As you approach the end of the first dock you will notice on your right a huge futuristic and very elegant building. This is the museum \u201cColecci\u00f3n de Arte Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat\u201d, which should definitely be on your list of places to see in Buenos Aires, if you have not done so yet. [I have reported earlier on this museum]. This brings you to the end of this route. Please note that you will have to go a bit further north to reach \u201cAvenida Cecilia Grierson\u201d to cross back to the other side of the docks and exit Puerto Madero [at Avenida C\u00f3rdoba] or continue to reach the \u201cAvenida Belgrano\u201d exit or to go back to the hotels.You could, if you wish to make the loop a little longer by continuing further south along the fourth dock. If you do, I would recommend that at the end of the fourth dock you turn back on the same side of the dock and then cross at the bottom of the third dock as in the original route. It is a bit difficult to cross to the other side of the docks at the end of the fourth dock. If you wish to run a longer route still, please see my next report that will follow in a few days. By the way, as Puerto Madero is quite new, you will notice that there are only few mature trees, and hence little shade, along this route. My advice therefore is to run as early as you can and to start the run, as described above, on the west side of the docks. You may also have noticed that the streets I mentioned are named after ladies. This is because all Puerto Madero streets are named after famous Argentine ladies. Enjoy your run!"

It is amazing to see, after a few years, how much the renovation efforts for the area of Buenos Aires' old port - the famous \"Puerto Madero\" - have changed and upscaled this whole neighborhood! At the same time, I must agree that the newly developed area looks much more like another town, almost disconnected of the Buenos Aires that we ever knew. The old warehouses are today occupied by restaurants, bars and hotels. Skyscrapers are seen here and there. Near it, at just a walking distance, a new museum housing the admirable \"Colecci\u00f3n de Arte Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat\". Visit the museum and have lunch at one of the very many restaurants of Puerto Madero. But, and there is always a but, don't expect to find high gastronomy. Puerto Madero's restaurants are much more on the touristic side. Bon App\u00e9tit!"

If we were traveling on our own, we would have been in a hostel or B&B. The Hilton was wonderful, but we would never pay that much on our own for a hotel. The Puerto Madero neighborhood is nice and much cleaner than the old city. There are many visible law enforcement officers since the Coast Guard also patrols this area, and I felt comfortable walking around at night. The area feels very disconnected from the rest of the city though. It's obvious that it's a business district, but the areas along the canal remained active well in to the evening hours. But we are also in the first week of winter holidays, or so I'm told. If you are looking for quaint traditional Latin America vibe, this isn't it. But it is safe and clean and within walking distance to the city center. I'd recommend a cab if you are going to San Telmo or Palermo though."

We had our best meal in BA here at Cabana Villegas. If food and modern architecture is not your thing, I will let you in on what seems to be a little mentioned secret. At night, and probably only on weekends, groups of young and middle aged men and women gather and dance their socks off to music played by impromptu DJs in very casual water-side \"dance clubs\". I am talking open-air and open to the public dance gatherings on the ultra wide sidewalk. You can stand and watch or join the action. We saw two such groups on Friday night. It seems like some of them got there by bus. There are also several fast food trucks parked by the water. A big contrast to the fine dining you find just two blocks west. If you want to see and experience a more laid back area right next to million dollar apartments, this was, for sure, a very unique experience for us. To find them, keep on walking Eastwards until you reach the river's edge (not the man made rectangular water areas. I will try to attach a video I took of one of the dancing groups. When they played faster and more popular songs, there were at least a 100 people dancing. Fun and very different."

Inspired by the model of Barcelona, Puerto Madero is a very good example of reconstruction and improvement of port old buildings that turned into beautiful restaurants.Although there are places to visit, the main attraction are the restaurants of all kinds, kitchen, taste and of course, prices.I consider the best gastronomic place of Bs.As."

Right on the river, this is a neighborhood full of upscale restaurants, bistros and cafes that will have a bit higher price tag. It's also a lovely place to walk around and enjoy a less crowded, greener neighborhood. The large, white, modern bridge (Puente de la Mujer) is a must, but If you're visiting during the winter, you'll want to go here during the daytime, as it gets rather windy on the river at night.

Common wisdom will indicate that Puerto Madero (PM) is a must visit while in Buenos Aires (BA) and I agree but do not expect anything special. It was the old main port of BA and it is worth walking around the 4 sections that will take you about 2 hours and take a look a the old structures (buildings and cranes) and new condominiums specially since it is at walking distance from other major attraction such as Teatro Colon among others. Restaurants at PM in my opinion are many overpriced and are not necessarily the best value for money since you will be paying the tourist trap but there are some with nice views, just check the menu. I did have lunch twice at Peugeot Lounge Cafe close to the BuqueBus side of PM and I found the place to be simple and provide excellent food (we ate creeps, generous sandwiches, soups, desserts and had the Patagonia beer) at a very reasonable price with same nice terrace - view. Enjoy your visit.jr"

It is good for that taking a good walk soaking in the views and maybe dining in one of the restaurants around but we warned it can be really expensive and if you are travelling by car, you will be searching hours for a good parking spot."

We were staying in Palermo Soho where we preferred the restaurants (better selection at reasonable prices) but we very much enjoyed our morning walk along the river. It was interesting to see the re-development of what was once the original Port (similar but a little different to many modern cities) - old warehouses converted into shops and apartments as well as the very modern pedestrian bridge...we couldn't quite see the curves of a woman as the Architect/Engineer? intended but it is a beautiful structure. (See photos) There was a Spanish guitarist playing on the bridge, it was a sunny day and such a relaxing thing to do. The other thing we enjoyed doing was a visit to the historic Argentinian ship moored near the pedestrian bridge - a very small entry fee & well worth a visit. After that we just had a burger for lunch at an outdoor cafe (on our walk back to Metro) as we read from TA that the restaurants in this area are overpriced for what you get."

Do you really want to pay through the nose for mediocre (at best) food in Puerto Madero, instead of having a superb culinary experience at a fantastic restaurant in Palermo, Recoleta, or San Telmo for 1/3 of the price?!? Did you go to Buenos Aires to buy a beautiful leather jacket at factory/outlet prices, or spend your hard-earned money on the same old uninspiring brand names at the frou-frou shops in Puerto Madero?! Is your money really burning a hole in your pocket? If the answer to any of the above questions is yes, then you'd feel right at home in Puerto Madero.Puerto Madero is definitely NOT the place to get a feel for, and experience, the authentic Buenos Aires. Yes I dare say it's a safe and manicured spot to visit and walk around for a bit (albeit ONCE), but it feels incredibly contrived, not to mention it's painfully far from the Palermo and the Recoleta [or even the San Telmo] neighborhoods, where most of the scenic and the otherwise interesting activities and the restaurants are. In short: We found Puerto Madero to be a glorified tourist trap, where the ailing Argentinian/Buenos Aires economy hopes to scalp the unsuspecting vacationing crowds. A contrived dog and pony show with very little (if any) redeeming value. If you must satisfy your curiosity about this 9th wonder of the world, then limit your rip-off exposure to window shopping and, for the sake of your children's college funds, stay away from those overpriced restaurants."

Rio De La Plata is an estuary on the southeast coast of South America between Argentina and Uruguay. Puerto Madero neighborhood represents the latest architectural trends in Buenos Aires and is considered one of the most successful waterfront renewal projects in the world.Beginning in the 1990s, there was local and foreign investment in regenerating and refurbishing Puerto Madero. Developers created elegant houses, offices, lofts, private universities, grand hotels, and restaurants. This new district was quite a change for a city that grew up \"turning its back to the river\u201d. Led by the opening of the Buenos Aires Hilton in 1999, luxurious hotels, state-of-the-art multiplex cinemas, performing arts theatres, cultural centers, and office and corporate buildings, including Oracle, are mostly on the east side of Puerto Madero. The streets are full of affluent young techies and college students.Puerto Madero redevelopment was of interest to renowned architects all over the world. Today it's the \u201cpreferred address for growing numbers of young professionals and retirees. Increasing prices have generated interest in the area as a destination for foreign buyers, particularly those in the market for premium investment properties\u201d.Every street in Puerto Madero is named after women. The Puente de la Mujer (Women's Bridge) is the newest link between the east and west docks of Puerto Madero. In 2008 Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat, the wealthiest woman in Argentina, inaugurated a museum in Puerto Madero, the Fortabat Art Collection."

It has a number of interesting vintage ships that can be visited for a modest entry fee. Beyond that is an ecological reserve much favoured by local people for walking, running and cycling. In between the two is pedestrianised area that contains an assortment of refreshment stalls, mobile bike hire and repair trallers, mobile a sweet and toy sellers and everything required for a family afternoon out."

After 2PM the night club starts inside ASIA DE CUBA and that place rocks!"

A very modern pedestrian bridge spans one place and older ones for auto traffic in a couple others. Walk toward the river into the nouveau neighborhood of high rises and along the real waterfront--actually looks like a wetland area. A lovely park all along there and you'll find the Humor Museum, a small place with a collection of cartoons. Everything in Spanish."

The row of building that make up the Puerto Madero water front area were at one time warehouses for cargo imported and exporter from the port of Buenos Aires. As break bulk and pallets gave way to massive cargo containers, these building were abandoned and fell into disrepair. The port was too small and much too shallow for larger ships and the surrounding area had no place for the acres needed for incoming and outgoing containers. Then a couple of decades ago, these building were rehabilitated. The exteriors of the building were sand blasted and revealing the beautiful, thick and solid brick walls. The restaurants here run from the casual to the up scale and from less than $20 per person to much more depending on your taste, your wallet what wine you choose. There is something for every taste, from pasta, to steaks, pizza, and even sushi. There are at least two places to buy ice cream, if that is all you are looking for. We have eaten there very often since 2004. If you walk on the waterside of the building, many restaurants have menus posted on stands so there is no pressure to ask to see a menu. If you get there for dinner at 7:30PM for dinner you will think business must very, very slow. Come back a 11PM and in most places the tables will all be taken. Unfortunately, in some places service, starts to slow down. I say, enjoy. We were there on the night of the full moon in March. Just perfect.Just looking for a place to enjoy an evening and stop in for just coffee or a cold drink, you will have come to the right place.Area seems to be perfectly safe day or night."

The brick warehouses have been converted into restaurants, bars and high end shops. They turned the street between the old warehouses and the river into a very pretty pedestrian walkway. Most of the bars/restaurants had outside seating on the old dock area and covered making for a beautiful afternoon casual lunch. There were a lot of portenos there on a Wednesday afternoon eating, strolling etc. There are two old wooden frigates moored there and available for tours (small fee). The newer bridge is an artistic design and well worth seeing and using of course. The area is close to two subway trains - we were using the red line.

Over my 3 visits to the city since 2008, this is the only district where I can say I have seen a significant improvement as judged by the number of new buildings and attractions, and the level of upkeep and maintenance of the area as a whole. Elsewhere one tends to see a city crumbling in the face of administrative ineptness and political chicanery. Maybe it is relevant that every street in this Barrio is named after a female, and that Calatrava\u2019s highly praised white bridge joining its two shores (actually, a rather ordinary effort by his superlative standards) is called THE BRIDGE OF WOMEN. Built initially to allow the largest ships of the early 20th Cent. to actually tie up and dock on city land, Puerto Maderait could not handle the much larger ships that followed, and degenerated into an unused dockland waste that was rejuvenated by legislation and massive investment starting in the 1990s and largely supported by foreign money. Old warehouses were converted into luxurious apartments, hotels and restaurants, cinemas and theatres. Spanking new luxury hotels sprang up from scratch, such as the Hilton, and the Faena (to which the designer Philipe Starck and the architect Norman Foster contributed), buildings that you simply must step into to see where the rich and famous eat and sleep when not at home. A whole cluster of elegant (but not always) high-rise commercial buildings have sprung up, and pay attention to the Edificio Republica (the work of Cesar Pelli, the country\u2019s most famous architect, renowned for Kuala Lumpur\u2019s Petronas Twin Towers), as well as the Boston Bank Building and the Repsol YFP Building. The Universida Catolica Argentina has a fair-sized campus that includes an Art Pavillion. Another religiously \u2013 inspired construction is the lovely Iglesia Nuestra Senora de la Esperanza, while art raises its head yet again in the shape of the Fortebat Collection and Museum, a recent addition donated by a celebrated lady noted for age, enormous wealth, and nastiness. I did not get a chance to see it, and I gather that admission is quite expensive but well worth while. Among the street art that you should not miss are the Font of the Nereids ( a lovely example of what this city can do with its spare water), and Edward Pla\u2019s monumental suspended globe The Sphere Dream. Finally, you also have two classic sailing ships known to all Argentinians (The Sarmiento and the Uruguay) moored in the river that you can climb aboard with your kids for a step back into naval history."

Every restaurant was closed, only some other strollers where around. The light was clear and the air quiet fresh. I would not like to live in this atmosphere of Puerto Madero, but visitors should not miss the area. You can take great photos. To eat here is very costly.

By the very end of the 19th Century and very early stages of the 20th Century, the main entrance and exit ways to and from Argentina was its Buenos Aires city port. Here not only passenger and general cargo ships were handled but also huge grains carrying ships that used to be filled up with different types of grains to be mainly carried to European consuming countries. Docks had their managing and handling buildings built right at their side, so today these buildings stand facing \"Moreau de Justo Ave.\" that runs close and parallel to the water side. It is an excellent area for a stroll or even for an early morning run as downtown with its hotels is just a few blocks away. Most if not all the former docks and port servicing buildings have been refurbished, now housing offices while on street level a few bars, different good restaurants and coffee shops can be found. During older port operating times, grains carrying ships would arrive empty, so in order not to sit too high and roll on the seas, ballast was added in the form of bricks. These were then unloaded and mostly used to build the mentioned servicing buildings as also others around the country. Grains were loaded replacing the dead ballast. Years back a thorough refurbishing of all the old port was undertaken, so the old buildings again showed the red bricks' walls in all their splendor, with the Catholic University being the most outstanding ones. At the docks, a couple of historical Frigates can be seen and visited too. Finally, the huge cranes used to move loads on the ships were brought back into their original shape and appearance, thus marking another reminiscense of the ports former activity. Sergio Corbet."

This is a second level attraction. But visit this area at meal time and let it do double duty. The area is worth a visit only if you\u2019ve been in town for a while and are seeking a diversion. Most interesting: The commercial urban architecture of the last century, the old cranes left over from the port days, the 19th century sailing ship, the Fragata Sarmiento, moored in the second pool and open for tours. Seaward of the pools and the new hi-rise development over looking them, is an immense botanical reserve. Puerto Modero is a big place. The four basins built to increase port capacity in 1890s, but were quickly out-dated. This area has been urban renewed. The gorgeous brick warehouses lining the pools have been remodeled into trendy apartments and port-side restaurants."

Puerto madero is the youngest neighbourhood in Buenos Aires, built around the old port. The entrerteinment offer is impressive, A bit fancy and overprized but you can find some jewels there.Walking along the docks by the water is beautifull, mostly in spring and autumm. You can visit 'El Puente de la Mujer' and the 'Corbeta Sarmiento (boat museum)', you also have there the 'Fortabat Museum' (great)'.You can also go to the inner borough and visit the old 'Costanera Sur' with beautiful art, statues, buildings, etc ... or have dinner at the 'Faena Hotel' (any way you have plenty of restaurants and drinks offers). 'La fuente de las Nereidas' is an extraordinary piece of art, and you can walk all along by parks and public show places.Get a morning, evening or a whole day and go there"

It does not have the old charm of Buenos Aires but it has nice architecture and it is a very pleasant and safe place to spend a sunny afternoon. Lots of restaurants and coffee shops.I recommend it. It is a big contrast to Bs As, not nicer in my opinion, but worth seeing it."

Puerto Madero is must when in BA, so you can see how the modern part of BA is expanding and growing. Not at the top of the list, but worth checking out.

The port has an interesting history as it became redundant almost as soon as it was built as the ships were too big to enter. There's an opportunity for enterprising locals to use the water more than they appear to do as a lot of the area is devoid of any boats. The restaurants are a bit pricy but it's pleasant enough on a fine day."

Puerto Madero located close to River Plate river, this place used to be the port for small ships and mainly fiscal warehouse for imports, in beginning 1990\u00b4s it was privatized and become a gastronomic complex with many restaurants, offices and appartments for living. This place take aprox 14 blocks from North to South. You will find beside restaurants,nice walking area near the river, some clothes stores, big international hotels, like Hilton and some boutique banks. It is nice to visit night and day with different atmosphere, safe place during the night. There are many restaurants ( meat, fish and pasta ), prices are not cheap but place compensate the cost"

Later, I learnt that Argentinian businessman Alberto L. Gonzalez underwrote the US$ 6 million cost of the dramatic bridge, unveiled in 2001. Is the bridge meant to represent a tango by a couple? Perhaps. This is a lovely location for a stroll, dotted with restaurants, cafes and public gym areas, because it is traffic-free."

It was abandoned for many years and now has become the newest and most expensive area in the city. Fancy hotels and restaurants both sides of the docks looking similar Fisherman\u00b4s Wharf in San Francisco, but much bigger. Great for a romantic dinner or, if you have de time, just walking arround to relax. The place is realy close to \"costanera sur\" a former place for families to go for a walk, now including a tiny natural reserve, were you can see how would be the place if man weren\u00b4t there. Great place. Worth the visit."

There is also the museum of comparative sculpture in the art school of Ernesto de la Carcova, where replicas of famous sculpture can be admired.Puerto Madero is divided in two sections separated by a canal. The west side is more exposed than the east side. I prefer the small cafes and restaurants on the east side, while the ones on the west side are more up scale and tend to be more touristy. A nice long walk is on the wide and tree lined Costanera avenue \" .

The Madero required the construction of a series of closed dams interconnected by bridges. The construction work began on 1 April 1887 and concluded on March 31, 1898. In less than a decade, however, these port facilities could not keep pace with the growth of commerce and between 1911 and 1925 construction development concentrated on a more open dockland further north along the river called Puerto Neuvo. Like many major port cities, this area declined in usage between the 1950s and the 1980s. In 1989 a corporation tasked to redevelop the area was formed. The former docks buildings have been transformed into apartment blocks and commercial centres. Wide pedestrian walkways border both sides of the river where there are numerous high-end stores and restaurants and nightclubs and art galleries. There is a marina full of large sail boats and yachts. It reminded us very much of the Docklands area of Dublin. It too features a Calatrava bridge as a centrepiece (where we were fortunate to witness a fashion photography shoot) and a permanently docked frigate sailing vessel."

The original port, built in 1890 has been renovated as a \"gourmet area\" where you can taste many of the wonderful argentinian meals, including \"asados and empanadas\". Beautiful and safe to walk at night, crossing the stunning bridge designed by Spanish architect Calatrava."

The obsolete red brick warehouse buildings at the port were renovated in the 1990's and now house shops, cafes, parilla and other fine restaurants as well as a few US chains such at M'D's, TGF and Burger King, so something for everyone! They is also a floating maritime museum docked there abroad a gorgeous old sailing ship. Cross to the other side of Puerto Madero strolling along the Puente de la Mujere, the Women's Bridge .. the gorgeous, simple design pedestrian swing bridge that elegantly spans the river. The other side of the river has more modern buildings and apartment blocks, the Hilton Hotel as well as some nice shops, cafes and restaurants.Both sides of the river at Puerto Madero are well worth strolling and the views back to the city are lovely from the river ."

After a torrid morning walking through the San Telmo market, being sprayed with a sauce bottle (usual attempt to scam the tourist - and having my cardigan ruined), it was a relief to detour to the river front and walk along the peaceful wide promenade without any potholes or broken paving. Lots of very classy looking restaurants and an extremely good ice cream shop - can't remember the name but it is on the riverside corner where Hungry Jacks is located on the cityside corner. Puerto Madero is a break from the narrow streets and gives you a refreshing space of open air to breathe in, plus some fantastic views."

Therefore it feels like a sea and 10 years ago was build Puerto Madero, a rich business district by the water. It's the only area in town with skyscrapers and that's why, when I was walking on the docks I felt like in another major harbour city.Its secret though is an ecological reserve at its edge where you completely forget you are in the busiest capital city of South America!

Puerto Madero had been designed as a freight port, but later the design was found inadequate and its usage was terminated. Many years the area stayed abandoned, but in the nineties the renovation started which turned Puerto Madero into one of the most luxurious neighborhoods of Argentina and, possibly, of South America. The old red-brick warehouses were refurbished preserving their original texture and color. Even the dock cranes were preserved and painted! One of those houses the tourist information desk. You can find some of the best restaurants and cafes of Buenos Aires there, many of which, however, are quite affordable for a middle-class customer. There are several wonderful museums in Puerto Madero, two of which are ships (Corbeta Uruguay and Fragata Sarmiento). There also are several arts museums such as the great Fortabat Art Collection and the exhibition hall of Universidad Catolica Argentina, which is also quite interesting. If the weather is fine one can have a great time just strolling along the Diques, enjoying the views and a refreshing breeze, watching the kayaks sailing to and fro..."

The refurbished warehouses and a really old schooner vessel and old fashioned port cranes, lend a maritime atmosphere, which is truly magical. It`s not the sea you are looking at , but a river, but it all really blends in, coupled with great security, as the Coast Guard is in charge there not the ordinary p\u00f3lice, and that really makes a lot of difference. The multitude of restaurant gives the whole \u00e1rea an incredible ambiance, so on a warm night this place is very hard to beat."

The habitable area is just new buildings with overpriced/low quality restaurants below and overpriced and poorly built apartments above, and sadly, we happened upon the area when Justin Bieber was in town taking over the Faena with gaggles of screaming protenas of the tween set which didn't help at all in making this a worth while sojourn for the day.

It has numerous parks and play areas for children as well as wide roads and boulevards. All the roads and walking areas are evenly surfaced and ideal for recreational uses, such as jogging, skateboarding and roller blading. It is amply supplied with cafes, restaurants and bars. All within a few minutes walk of the city centre.Presumably this is why it is a mecca for the city inhabitants (portenos) at weekends and public holidays - especially during the warmer months. There is a reasonably sized supermarket located towards the eastern end of the area.Puerto Madero is generally expensive when compared to the surrounding districts, but this does not seem to deter locals and tourists alike, from visiting the area.There is also a large nature reserve in the area immediately adjoining the River Plate and next to Av. Int. Hernan M. Giralt. This same avenue boasts a host of 'parillas' or open air, semi-permanent outside grills or bar-be-ques.They serve simple grilled foods such as steak sandwiches, sausages, hamburgers and hot dogs. Every parilla has its own mouthwatering display of self-service salads, sauces and fillings for the customer to feast upon as well as supplies of cold drinks. Also provided are simple seating areas, consisting of just tables and chairs. Popular with workers from the nearby office buildings, these eateries are popular with -in-the-know' tourists and ideal treats for children. The prices are very reasonable, the service is friendly and the eating experience is most enjoyable."

That's where the threat of pick pockets are, especially in the open air markets and the notorious Florida street shopping belt.

I personally have the feeling of walking along a high scale architectural model, nice, clean, spotless, sometimes close to perfection, but lacking soul. Though the original buildings of Puerto Madero were the charming red docks that were remodelled and turned into beautiful apartments, the architectural development of the area has overshadowed its charm. Anyway, it is modern, safe, agreable, with a wide gastronomic offer: in short: worth a visit to be able to compare it to the rest of Buenos Aires"

If you travel to Buenos Aires, you don't want to be in Dublin (there is even the \"same\" Calatrava Bridge to greet you), San Diego, Singapore or London's east end - you want to be in Buenos Aires - The old city, the Paris of South America, the architecture, the milongas, the old cafes with style.Yes, it's safe, it's airy, its clean, something a lot of BA lacks, but it has no atmosphere. Some nice, if expensive, restaurants, and on the plus side, some nice traffic free areas to run along, but overall, it does not give you the BA Experience - Pop over to see if for an hour, but only on your way to somewhere else in this wonderful city."

Inaugurated as a residential and touristic centre (with also some business offices and universities) some 20 years ago, this huge quarter used to be a horrible mixture of port long abandoned deposits and garbage dropping high-grassed voids, where fugitives and thieves searched sanctuary among rats and cockroaches. Recycled at an exorbitant cost, in not completely clear financial operations, during President Menem rule, in the '90s, it became the most expensive residential flats place in town, home for nouveau-riches and well-done politicians (the Vice-President included). Excellent restaurants (mostly \"for-gringos\") are located here over the docks (now used by sailboats), in a nice environment, with some remote resemblance to the new Thames embankments in London. A walk along these shores is worth the while, visiting the old military sail-ships in display, and crossing through the imposing \"Bridge of Woman\" (all streets in this quarter are named after renowned local women, no man's name allowed). You will find a lot more tourists than porte\u00f1os here, but presently it is a must."

ENJOY IT!."

I walked to Puerto Madero from Hotel Bristol; did not take me that long. I was hoping to see restaurants here with English in the menus. There were several places that offered this. I just happened to walk in the first restaurant that had a bi-lingual menu. It was very expensive and I still ate here! The marina is very clean and there are ample restaurants to choose from. There are a couple of big old boats you can get on board. The one I went to had an entrance fee of only $2 Pesos. There is also a very interesting pedestrian bridge. It is pure white and has an unusual spike to it. I believe it is 'the bridge of mothers.'"

On the way down we were approached by a couple who threw a nasty smelling soupy liquid on our clothes and proceeded them to rip us off. Watch out when you are walking around Buenos Aires for these crafty pick pocket-ers which unfortunately take the fun out of walking and enjoying the city . The restaurants down in the Puerto Madero are very touristy and over priced for the quality of food served, in our opinion."

There are 4 docks (digues, in Spanish) that form a long strip of modern, high-end restaurants and bars. You can also stroll along the marina and see the modern bridge (Bridge des Mujeres). It's a safe area. In addition to police, many of the restaurants have their own security staff. (Panhandlers will often target diners on the many terraces.)It's popular with tourists and locals alike, particularly for business lunches and happy hours. There's quite a bit of parking. One warning: it's safe to walk to get here by day, but at night, you would have to cut through some sketchy areas to reach the nearest Subte station - take a remise or radio taxi!If you're not dining here, it's not worth the trip on its own, but many restaurants are worthy destinations; so do your research online on places like Cabana Las Lilas or La Bistecca and decide for yourself."

So yes Puerto Madero is all new and not the \"authentic\" Buenos Aires that tourists imagine, but come on, this a metropolis, there's a little bit of everything here and while I love wandering the streets of Recoleta and wandering if this is what Paris looks like, Puerto Madero has it's charms as well. Namely, cleanliness, safety and calm. The area is patrolled by the Coast Guard who are better paid than the regular police, which is why it's much safer than the rest of downtown. Because there's hardly any public transportation into Puerto Madero there aren't so many people, you have to walk to get there, it's worth it in my opinion, especially around sunset. When the weather's good it's a sweet spot for people watching, just watch out for the hordes of rollerskates along the canal. Now this is an expensive area and you can't expect to get a cheap meal here, but if you're willing to pay you have some pretty awesome choices. My favorites are Mirasol (they have the best lomo and then apple pancake dessert, they also have a seafood sister restaurant next door which I haven't tried yet) and La Parolaccia (great pasta and service!)."

We also like clean, safe and quieter at night - we will find the culture, the hidden areas and such during the rest of the day, but once we hit a bed, we like the items mentioned. Puerto Madero is really that - a bit of a walk to the metro (or a walk in general) or a cab to see the rest of the sites. Quiet, lots of police and more restaurants than you could tackle in a month all next to a cool riverfront area. The Hilton was our base for this assessment - other properties in Puerto Madero are likely to be very similar since the entire area is similar from what we saw. Don't stay here if you don't like walking or cabs, since you will have to do one of them each day most likely. (though the metro in Buenos Aires is quiet minimal and I suspect a lot of neighborhoods will require the same walking or cab usage...)"

I knew this place already, so I was aware that most of the cafes and restaurants are only looking for those green tourist bills - if you know what I mean.Anyhow, it was a nice walk and great place for taking pictures. We took several pics on the sunset and some other with the contrast of new and old buildings. Those are surely the coolest from our Buenos Aires stay.But: we finally found a cool place to hang out. It is basically a Kiosk. It is just at the Yacht Club, which at the northern end of Puerto Madero (close to the \"Telecom\" Building and the \"Buquebus\" harvor that takes you to Urugay). They had tables outside, it was full of younger people and all you had to do was to walk inside, buy your drinks, pay at the counter and walk outside. So, self-service that is. So we could enjoy the sunset in a nice spot and didn't spend much money for our drinks and snacks.We also saw the \"Fragrata Libertad\", and old military boat. Pretty cool.By the way, Puerto Madero was built earlier than the Havor City in Hamburg."

We rented an apt for our second month - which cost us less then our Recoleta Apt - but this one includes, pool and gym - The new neighborhood is convenient (grocery and drug store) and a walk to San Telmo Market on Saturdays.We are very much looking forward to our month in Puerto Madero."

In the interim, it is hot or cold, windy and pricey and the entire area - with its soaring apartment high-rises and paucity of street level personal emenities and haunts - is entirely out of human scale and proportion. If you are considering a longer term rental property in this barrio, know that it is a trudge to the Metro -thus locals keep cars secure behind gated walls - and it is the one place in Buenos Aires where taxis seem not to cruise, although on the city center side there is the broad but noisy Avenida de Justo. For some being near to canal water might outweigh these considerations. For the historically minded tourist the Sarmiento Frigate Museum is worth a look and the fancifully winged pedestrian bridge is a photo-op."

As you can see from the images below, a great time of day to visit this city within a city is near dusk: the lighting is beautiful and traffic is at a minimum. From what we understand, after dark, the port is bustling with people eating at expensive restaurants and cafes (they even have a TGI Fridays) and/or going to dance clubs. While we didn't dance, Puerto Madero is a great place to take a stroll."

It was missing the flavor that I had always associated with Buenos Aires, but it was safe and a great place to grab a bite.

This relatively new residential - and chic- area of Buenos Aires was until 20 years ago mostly a wasteland, since the silos and other abandoned buildings form the once busy port were mostly derelict.It holds a number of elegant and expensive but somehow understated apartment buildings as well as offices andrestaurants and shops. All of them rather expensive.At first, the whole area seemed rather cold, the trees along itswide avenues being then too young to add any softening input to the rather rectilinear architecture, in many instances reminding the visitor of the newly developed area around Postdamer Platz in Berlin. Now, the trees have grown tall enough to add charm and contrast to the once barren streets and there are severalnice coffee shops where one can sip a good coffee and alsovery nice photo ops, since there is a magnificent bridge byspanish architect Calatrava spanning accross a canal, part of which has been transformed into a marina.There is also a fine museum: Fundacion Fortabat whose modern structure contrasts very nicely against the old brickstructures from the old port buildings. At times, one forgets thatthis is Buenos Aires until some faint tango music brings you back. Don't be fooled by the fact that Puerto Madero has to bereached on purpose, as there are at least three major wide avenues to cross before reaching it from the older part of town.Tip: take a cab and then walk back."

It is within easy walking distance of downtown, but worlds apart. We strolled down from Casa Rosada and walked along the canals enjoying views of new contemporary architecure in Buenos Aires. It is a safe and clean area filled with lots of restaurants and bars. We visited the Sarmiento ship which as fascinating-particularly the taxidermied dog. Since we do not speak much Spanish getting the full story about the ship was challenging but with the photographs and maps, it worked fine. After our visit there, it was time for lunch and we stopped at one of the canal side cafes and had a delightful nosh and a huge canister (no other way to describe it) of Quismel beer. It was great to relax, take in the views and people watch. From there we headed across the bridge to the other side of the canal and back to the Ecological Preserve. It is truly amazing that they have restored this wetlands area on the edge of this huge, bustling city. There are many trails and as you move through, it is hard to believe that you are still in the city. We stopped by the Collection de Amalia Fortabat next and were astounded at the architiecture of the building and the collection. This is a must see museum in Buenos Aires. We throughly enjoyed our day there and highly recommend it as a way to escape the hustle and bustle of the Avenue de Mayo and Calle Florida."

We were recommended to go there by the Concierge at our hotel and it was a 15 minute walk which was most pleasant , We were lucky with the weather ...no rain so it was lovely to walk the waterfront and there were of locals around enjoying the breeze and views. We had dinner in one of the many restaurants there which was very good though a little expensive. We also saw the tango show at the Madero and it was super.Five couples in the show nd they were suberb!"

But, if you want to go outside at night, downtown becomes a desert area -don't forget downtown is just banking and business buildings-, and the aforementioned neighborhoods are somewhat far away from the usual hotel areas. Until 1990, Puerto Madero was an abandoned area of the Port, since then it has been fully refurbished and it has become the place where you can find the newest, most modern buildings and condos in Buenos Aires. Most Movie & TV personalities, millionaires and well known singers and artists are now living (or have properties) in this area. Security is tight here, not just due to camera surveillance or private security people, but because it is a special area of the city, since it is separated from the coast and built on lands gained to the river, the security depends on the \"Prefectura Naval\" (Navy Police) which is very strict regarding security matters.Here, you can walk freely without worrying about thieves or the like, and if you go the the Alicia Moreau de Justo Avenue, you'll find lots of bars & restaurants, with many options, from cheap to extremely luxury. You can access to some comments on restaurants from my profile. Even if it is just for a walk, you can have good views of the De La Plata River; on a full moon night, it's something worth to see."

In 1998, the governments of Argentina and the City of Buenos Aires created the Corporation of Puerto Madero as a means to spur redevelopment of this blighthed area, and new economic development.

The best thing about Puerto Madero is Avenida Hernan on the weekend. The parilla's and the street fair really liven the place up. It is a shame no cares to help throw garbage awey though. The litter is out of control.Should you walk the nature reserve just try and keep a positive outlook. Remember that this use to be a wasteland, mother nature is trying to beat back the porteno's lack of cleaning up after themselves and someday these people shall pass.The beaches are a sad sad sight. I would recommend coming hear to walk the trails and enjoy some quiet time in BA, just avoid the beach areas should litter bother you."

While nothing exceptional, Puerto Madero is a nice place to walk along the water and there are ample benches all around if you want to just sit and relax and enjoy the nice day (and an occasional breeze). There are many restaurants in Puerto Madero which cater to tourists - menus printed in English, outdoor seating, and higher prices. The food that we had at the restaurants there was fine, but no better than the food we found for considerably less in other neighborhoods. The outdoor seating is nice and the atmosphere is enjoyable. You can also see the famous \"Woman\" bridge and tour a few old Argentine naval ships for a minimal cost (2 pesos per person), which are interesting but require only about 20 minutes of time. All the information on the ships is provided solely in Spanish, so if you don't know Spanish you're basically just looking at various artifacts. My suggestion would be to spend a few hours walking around Puerto Madero to see it (maybe early morning or in the evening), and then go on to other parts of the city. If possible, visit when you want nothing more than helado (ice cream) as a snack, because there are better places in Buenos Aires to eat."

I first visited in March 2006, when a taxi driver took me to Cabana Las Lilas, a restaurant I thoroughly enjoyed, although it is touristy and pricey by comparison. Still Puerto Madero is a great place to visit, and it is nice on hot days to sit on one the many verandas along the waterside to partake of a cool beverage. I met some very nice local people at the Spell Cafe, and returned there a few times for more reasonably priced food and drink. The Calatrava or Women's Bridge is an architectural work of art. I spent much more time in the area when I rented an apartment in BA for a month in 2007, and got to really check things out. Cabana Las Lilas is great, but noisy inside when busy; sit outside in the back if you can. I think that applies to all the places along the canal. I've eaten there about six times. Never disappointed. Great service. My fine steak dinners there averaged about 50 American dollars, but I was extravagant, having at least one bottle of good wine, appetizers, dessert, and espresso. My more favored restaurant is La Baita in Palermo, but that's for another review."

            "review": "Must visit this place. I felt compelled to write a review because the other ones are too old. I stayed in Buenos Aires with my wife and children during August 19-26 / 2007. Puerto Madero is one of the places that you must visit in Buenos Aires. I understood that it was the old Buenos Aires' port and was a ruin until a few years ago when the city began urban renewal of all the place. In one side you will see new and modern buildings and on the other the old port depots converted to beatiful buildings with restaurants, stores and apartments. You will find two interesting ships from the 1890 and 1920s that are museums. Even the old cranes have been painted and restored and are now an original decoration of what once was the main port of Buenos Aires.The place is perfect to visit at any time, and it is huge. You have to like to walk. Near dike 1 you will find Caba\u00f1a Las Lilas. Superb food, wine and service. It is expensive for Argentinian standards, but I am sure you will find it not as expensive as many similar restaurants in other countries that don't get even closer to Las Lilas quality. In the other extreme (dike 4, you have to walk a lot) you will find Siga La Vaca restaurant. An All you can Eat restaurant, inexpensive and excellent. Don't expect gourmet wine or service, but we don't have any complaint. You pay per each person that take a chair and the included beverage can be a bottle of wine (per person!!). My wife wasn't feeling well, we think due to some virus, and the waitress was kind enough as to offer not to charge her if she didn't feel good to eat. At the end my wife ate because everything was so good.I don't have any problem with pickpockets or strange people. There are policemen everywhere and the place is clean, open, full of students of a nearby university, people that work in the office builidings and other tourists. Between dike 1 and dike 4 you will find a lot of other restaurants. They looked nice but I didn't eat at them, so can't say anything about their quality. On the other hand, one thing difficult to find during our visit to B.A. was a place with bad food. We didn't get into anyone.Regarding taxis, remises and radio taxis. Radio taxis require a telephone number before sending you a taxi. So have at hand your hotel or rented apartment phone number. They don't accept cell phones if the number is from other country. We used this service mainly to get from our apartment to other place. Once in the street, we used to stop taxis and didn't have any bad experience. But we are latinamericans and our first language is Spanish. Our accent revealed we are foreigners but even the worst faced taxi driver that we met, was at the end much nicer that any other similar taxi drivers we had met in other countries. Use common sense and be modest. I found the porte\u00f1os (Buenos Aires people) are the most educated and friendly people. They will help you and make you feel at ease."

Together with Las Ca\u00f1itas, in Palermo, I'd say this is one of the finest dining districts in the city, with plenty of high quality, excellent value restaurants to choose from.\"Caba\u00f1a las Lilas\" is supposed to be the best parilla in BsAs. However, it's far more expensive than most steak houses... and the steak is definitely not worth it, although the place and service are wonderful (especially the table \"cover\", which includes mozzarella, salmon, pepperonatta and a delicious freshly baked bread). Table \"cover\", nonetheless, adds $10 to the bill which are not specified anywhere, so be warned. I think a better choice would be \"La Chacra\", a wonderful parrilla at Cordoba Av., near 9 de Julio.Our second (and far better) dining experience was at \"Marcelo\", a restaurant owned by Buenos Aires' renowned chef Marcelo Piegari (who also owns \"Piegari\", the city's best restaurant as stated everywhere). Pasta and risottos are made for sharing, and the fresh pasta (made at the restaurant) is absolutely amazing! Try the spinach-ricotta filled ravioli with pomodoro sauce, it's truly an epicurean experience. Desserts are wonderful, too. The meal for two was $30.All in all, I'd highly reccomend Puerto Madero to anyone in Buenos Aires."

I find most of the scam problems or pick-pocketing takes place in areas frequented by tourists and Puerto Madero is one of them. It is by itself and outside of the real downtown district and developed only recently with more of an international standard of development. The best meat restaurant Cabanas Las Lilas is there so you will want to go there, but just be very cautious about currency switch scams. Check you bill and your change at the restaurant and be sure to keep your eyes on the money you hand over to the cab driver. And get very suspicious if all the sudden all he claims you are giving him are counterfiet bills.Ask him to take you to the main police station on Lavalle 400, only a few blocks away and get the currency sorted out."

During the day we went shopping and had some very pleasant meals. There is plenty of security so we felt safe. On frommers we read about a restaurant named Cabana las lillas which is supposedly the best \"parilla\" in buenos aires. With such a great article about this restaurant we decided to make this place a definite stop. The restaurant I must say is beautiful, it is right on the river and it is very upscale. The \"parilla\" grill is enclosed in glass allowing the guests to see the food being prepared. The service was also great. Now...the food. Our party had seven guests, not one of the main courses was even decent. The steak was so hard and veiny that I had to end up leaving half of it! (and I am talking about the filet mignon). The meal for seven was only $175 dollars (incl. wine, beer, dessert) other than the ambiance I would have had more quality food at Burger King!"
