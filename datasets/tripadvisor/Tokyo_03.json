            "review": "Amazing sumo tournament!. Having never seen sumo live before, I had no idea what to expect. I thought I'd be bored after an hour. Not so! Sumo matches are short but very exciting to watch, and the crowd was great and supportive of their favorites. We paid about $90 for two people, but this is for mid-tier, all-day seats so I don't consider it expensive. I do recommend buying tickets on your own in advance, rather than going through some tour agency, because the stadium is really easy to get to and fun enough without a tour guide (and the tour guide's price markup!). I recommend getting chankonabe for lunch or dinner nearby--if you do you won't need to eat again for quite a while!"

            "review": "One of the most unique and captivating sporting events I've been to. We lucked into tickets to see a day of the September sumo basho (tournament) while in Tokyo for vacation, through the friend of a friend who couldn't use her tickets. The pageantry is so medieval it's like imagine if jousting on horseback had remained a spectator sport unbroken in tradition since the days of Henry the VIIIth. Sumo is also much more exciting live than via Youtube. The crowd is very into it, cheering and clapping at even the good moves during the pre-fight posturing that goes on. To Western eyes the pre-fight seems almost silly, like pro wrestlers pumping up the crowd, but it's actually the first round of the fight in a lot of ways, and live that's much more obvious than on video. Seeing an afternoon of sumo is a lot like watching an afternoon of baseball. There's a lot of sitting around chatting and eating (and just like in baseball, the better seats have waiter service, while the rest of us go to concession stands) punctuated by exciting action at measured intervals. There are people who find baseball boring and so I'm sure there are some who would find sumo boring, too, but to anyone who knows a little about the martial arts and who generally likes spectator sports, sumo live is a rewarding experience. The atmosphere is very genial and family-oriented, too, again reminding me of American baseball. ABOUT THE VENUE: There is a large trophy case with fascinating artifacts from sumo history in it, and on tournament days there are souvenir vendors, mascots to take photos with, etc. The \"box seats\" are four person platforms with cushions--you remove your shoes and sit crosslegged or lounge around. The upper deck appears to have regular stadium-style seats which might be better for westerners who aren't comfortable sitting on the floor."

Bit worried that the a sumo tournament may not hold the attention of my two daughters and wife for the afternoon but was completely wrong.Had four box seats - you are in a a box with four cushions surrounded by couples, families, business men and friends. People are here for a great afternoon and you can feel it in the it air. We were there on the Friday before the Sunday final and things wee beginning to heat up.Like any big sporting event it's about the crowd, some drinks /food and the battle. As a newbie to this I would arrive around 3, get settled, drinks/food, meet the neighbours and prepare for the final session.Sumo is as much about the theatre as it is the bouts. If you can get hold of a ticket then go - it is something you will remember forever.The final bout was massively exciting and finished with everyone frisbeeing their cushions into the ring while cheering, chanting and clapping. If it can hold the attention of two girls 11/12 on the back of a 10 her flight it's got to be good."

If you are in Tokyo for the Sumo wrestling tournament it is worth going to watch .Tickets can be ordered in advance or bought on the day.The arena is huge. the wrestling goes on all day, best to visit for the final bouts as you get to see the better wrestlers - 3/6pm.Drinks , toilets, food and gift shops on each seating level.To appreciate the kills it might be best to mug up on the rules and etiquette of Sumo wrestling before you visit. Bouts can be over in 3 seconds but the pre bout rituals are interesting to watch."

            "review": "Sumo tournament. We had a great time at the sumo tournament. We managed to get tickets online ahead of time (we went on a Friday night, and it was sold out when we got there). When we got the tickets, they recommended either buying an entire box of 4 seats, or 2 regular seats. The box seats are mats on the floor, and once we got there we could see why they'd recommended buying all 4 seats; they're small and nothing in the way of back support. If you're not used to sitting on the floor for long periods of time and/or you have back issues or anything like that, you might want to consider the seats a level up. They're very comfortable and afford a great view of everything that's going on.The tournament is interesting, but unless you're really into Sumo, don't worry about showing up until around 5pm. The tournament starts at like 8am, but the good bouts are all later. The entrances of the 2 main groups are worth seeing, and you want to stay to the bow ceremony at the end. Getting out is a little crazy, so my suggestion is either wait til the crowd disperses a bit, and maybe try to find a place nearby to hang out for an hour, as the trains were packed solid (but what's Tokyo without a sardine-tight train ride, right?)."

I purchased tickets online on the day they became available so the good seats sell quickly. We sat in the boxed area with four cushions on the floor. This was squishy as my son and husband are over six foot tall but we figured it would be an authentic experience. We were there for around five hours so managed to make it work.I collected tickets at the venue - there are signs at kiosks that say \"will call\" which is terminology used on online documentation. You will need credit card number of card used to purchase to redeem tickets. There are plenty of food options at stadium and surrounds and a McDonald's across the road. I would highly recommend a sumo experience as it gives you a great insight to the tradition and sport."

We went the second to last day (14th day, Saturday) of the September tournament. We arrived about 2 pm which was a good time to get there. They were wrapping up a session and many people started to arrive about 2:30. I would highly recommend getting the radio to listen to while you are there. They start renting them out at 2:30 and its $32 but you get $30 back when you return it. The English commentators were good and helped us follow what was going on.There are about 20 matches in the final session, going from about 4-6 pm. We followed along the bout sheet that showed the wrestlers with their record for the tournament. There were some excellent matches and one guy was 13-0 and he clinched the tournament win with a victory during this session. The crowd went crazy! The pre match warming up, etc is worth the price of admission. The ceremonies and rituals really aren't that long. Very cool venue and glad we went!"

We are by no means sumo fans, but it's one of those traditional, authentic Japanese activities that you can't afford to miss.The rules are relatively easy to pick up, and the atmosphere is fantastic - especially later on once the really good wrestlers start coming out. We sat next to a Japanese chap who shared his food with us, tried to talk to us about the matches, and encouraged us to lob our cushions once the last match was over!We also got a hand-drawn sumo picture which was signed in Japanese by the artist. Superb."

If you are in September in Tokyo go for it! Sumo is only a few weeks a year. Tokyo in September, Nagoya in July, check for Osaka and another place (can't remember).At the Ryogoku Kokugikan in Tokyo a 4 persons box is J\u00a538,000 (about \u00a370 per person). It is more expensive to get nearer the ring. Amazing spectacle. The price is for a \"box\" - an enclosed square with four low metallic bars and four thin cushions. There is a beer bottle opener attached to the rail. People take big bags of food - bento boxes on sale inside the venue. The sumo wrestling started in the morning with the novice rank, the top levels were after 2pm and it ended at 6pm.Quite empty until the big guns arrive. Cross legs sitting on the floor was hard work. Two in a box is comfortable, three a squeeze, four is like battling for elbow space on an economy flight, then add the legs! If four can stay in meditative lotus position that's fine, otherwise take turns to walk around, that's okey. Sumo wrestlers' special soup (Chanko) available downstairs, or taste the Chanko later at a restaurant (the Chanko Kirishina) belonging to a retired Sumo champion. After a day on the floor, you might want chairs to sit on, so head for the Chanko Kirishina's fourth floor (lift) and forget the ground floor tatami."

Tip: hang outside the stadium at the food trucks and souvenir stores that are set up near side entrance. While fans queue up to get in, you have scored a top spot where the sumo big boys enter and leave. And they are happy to pose for photos. We snacked, enjoyed beer in the sun, watched matches on the food truck's big TV and had some sumo fun. When the tournament is not on you can visit a sumo museum. Next time.

The tournament takes place in the Ryogoku Kokugikan (national sumo arena) which is placed in the part of Tokyo called Ryogoku. The arena is placed yust infront of the railway station, if you come with JR, if you come by subway it will take you cca 5 min. walk from the subway station Ryogoku. It is a whole day event, although the main competition starts after 15h.Do not miss the chanko nabe (stew for sumo wrestlers) which is served in the banquet hall in the basement of the arena( from 12h-16h, for 300 Y). The daily ticket allows you one reenty, so it is allowed to go out once. You can stroll through Ryogoku and try to have lunch in one of the numerous small restaurants in the tiny streets across the railway station. Tickets should be booked well in advance.All in all this a unique expirience for the Tokyo visitors which I strongly recommend."

Tickets were easy to buy and pick up in English on the Oosumo website. It is really easy to see from anywhere in the stadium and typically there are people coming and going all day so once you're in you can sit in another free seat until it's occupier comes if you want. Food and drink is available inside but the queues can be really long during breaks between bouts. You can bring it in from the convenience store even though the sign says otherwise! I found the ritual and ceremony really interesting and the fight was exciting. I was lucky to be there when the best wrestlers were fighting. They walk around outside and you can talk to them and get pictures even though they are very famous in Japan, so if you didn't manage to score a ticket it's still nice to visit during championships and visit the Tokyo-Edo Museum as well. I'd love to watch sumo again next time in Tokyo."

Seat selection is not an option for discounted tickets as they are only available when seats are not sold. Make sure you go early if you are planning to get discounted tickets. Sumo matches begin around 9am with major matches starting mid-afternoon. The ticket allows for same day in/out privileges. We noticed that people brought food in the stadium and no one seemed to mine. They have food on site as well if you do not have time to go out to buy your own. We got to the arena around 2pm and was able to catch a glimpse of some of the sumo wrestler walking into the arena.

There are 300 odd tickets that they sell from 8am each morning of the tournament for general seating in the back row, make sure you arrive much earlier then this though as they do sell out of these tickets quickly. The sumo itself goes the whole day but the best sumo's start from about 2pm. Eat Chunko, it's a sumo staple diet food to bulk up. You can also get away with bringing food and drink in usually despite the signs saying otherwise.

So my first piece of advice is that depending on how flexible you are, check the tournament dates and plan your trip around that.The arena is quite impressive from the outside, but once you get inside it is stunning. Sumo is one of the most unique things I have experienced in my life. So different to any sport of cultural activity I know or have seen before. I would highly recommend. The seats are very comfortable and the ticket is valid all day. We got the second cheapest for I believe about 20/25 pounds. We still had a good view. We showed up around 2.30pm before the higher league started, and a lovely (and well deserved) nap and then enjoyed the show. The lights in the stadium are just right as well, not too bright not too dark. Not speaking english didn't matter although I think to have a better experience you might want to brush up on Sumo wrestling rules. But by observing we understood most of it after a couple fights.All in all a highlight of our trip. Make sure you book in advance. I would also recommend enjoying a bento box while you are there to take the cultural experience a bit further. Unique and amazing."

We went early and stood in line and got day of general admission tickets as tournaments sell out weeks in advance. These tickets go on sale every morning at the stadium at 8am. Only 350 tickets are sold each day and when you arrive you are given a number 1-350 which allows you to stand in line to buy a tix. We got there around 7:20AM and just barely made the cutoff. Matches start at 9 but the good wrestlers don't wrestle until after 2pm so we actually went and did other sights in the morning and came back to the stadium at 2 and stayed til the end. Once in the stadium the general admission seats are the very highest row seats but no one seems to check tickets and there were blocks of empty seats so we sat very low and if anyone did come we just moved to another area."

Sumo wrestlers are well and truly worshipped in Japan, so I was very happy when we arrived having prebooked tickets through the english website before we left.I was also very surprised to see some of the wrestlers walking in just off the street! Despite the language barrier, two I asked for a photo with were happy to oblige.The stadium itself is incredible to arrive in, there's not a bad seat in the house so don't worry too much about paying for the close tickets, we were right up the back but had a great view and I would guess that is the case for most of the stadium.We turned up mid afternoon, probably around 2:30 because we were told our tickets had to be collected by 3.This ensured we saw much of the 'reserve grade' bouts, plus the top fighters. You're given a sheet with the day's match ups + each fighter's tournament results, which is handy as it gives you an idea of who the stronger fighters are, and who's not going as well.Great to see how passionate the crowd was about some of the wrestlers. The whole spectacle was just amazing and great fun."

Please go around 2:30 or 3 PM and stay till end which is at around 6. It would be a thrilling expereince to learn about this great national game of Japan and see the Sumos in action. We booked our tours through Viator and they were very peofessional about the whole thing. Its extremely difficult to get tickets on your own even when I tried the day tickets started selling. But if you can buy tickets on your own, you dont need to book a tour and it will save you a lot of money. But in any case, do not miss this while in Tokyo."

I went to watch a day of sumo wrestling during the May Festival and it has to be one of my favourite travelling experiences.The ritual around the sumo wrestling is gripping and it is very watchable, even if you have never watched the sport before. The arena itself is very impressive. There is a variety of food and drink available just outside the arena, including the high protein dish that sumo wrestlers eat to bulk up. I would say the entire venue has a good view of the arena. You can also very easily bump into the sumo wrestlers when you walk around the outside of the arena.Tip: the high profile sumo wrestlers are on much later in the day. The second tier wrestlers enter early afternoon, and the top tier wrestlers enter mid-to late-afternoon."

            "review": "Sumo secrets unlocked. By now you have already ready that this is a fantastic, quintessentially Japanese experience that I'd highly recommend to first-timers in Tokyo. So let's get to what you want to know..how do I get tickets!? Ok there are several ways to get to see the tournament.1- prepay for your tickets online before you leave for your trip. You can find sumo tickets online , I use the official sumo association website to buy my tickets. But you can find 3rd party retailers too. Remember there is a date change when you fly in to japan. So be sure to plan with that date change in mind.2- family mart conveniance store has events tickets which you can by at the store. You will need to read Japanese or have someone hellp you navigate the kiosk screen to get your tickets.3- Day of tickets, you will need to go early to the the ticket booth at the arena and buy open general seating tickets. these tickets are very limited less then 200 for regular day match. I doubt you would be able to get open seating for,the final,day but it's still,worth a try. I recommend you get there no later that 0530-6am. Box office opens at 7. You will see the line when you get there. 4- Craigslist...yes you can find people,selling there tickets on craigslist. Obviously this would be a last resort and buyer beware. The Japanese culture really frowns upon scalping tickets. But you can find scalpers but it won't be like in the states where they are openly selling tickets. You may run across a guy usually a foreigner whispering something about tickets. Things to keep in mind. If you buy a box seat, it's is made to seat for people...Japanese people... The box is roughly 4x5 you will be seated on the floor. It can be uncomfortable if your aren't flexible. Squeezing 4 Americans will be a challenge but who cares have fun!English-language commentary is available even for the higher-level matches. Once your are in the arena look for,the radio rental table. Don't be put off at the price 3200 yen, it's a deposit. You will get 3000 yen back when you return to the radio to them. For 200 yen it's well worth listening to the English commentary and making the match enjoyable.When to go. Ok so the matches start at 8 am. Unless you are a die hard fan or your son is a junior light weight wrestler your probably can wait to go later in the day. The match starts off with the lowest of,the low wrestling. The neat part about it is that even the grand champion started off that way. I recommend going about 2 pm. You can wonder the arena buy your sumo souvenirs grab a bite to eat and settle,in your seat. The big boys start to arrive about 3 pm and they start the ring ceremony for the paying ranks about 345pm. This is what you came for! Where ever you are seated you will notice a lot of open seating. You will be tempted to jump in another seat or to,something closer . You can take a chance an try and move to get a better view just be ready to move when you see that guy looking for,his seat and your are in it. Simple apologize and smile. Remember the Japanese are very by the rules culture and it may be frowned upon not to be in your assigned seat, but you can always drop the foreigner card and play dumb, you will be forgiven.Picture taking - yes take pictures snap away! Flash and all! The arena will be full of photo ops. You will see full,figure cut outs of the top,wrestlers around which can be a fun picture. You will want to take a picture of the wrestler themselves. The best time to do this is when you see the wrestlers leaving for the day outside the arena.You will find that even the top ranked wrestlers are very gracious and are usually happy to pose with you for a photo. Just asked politely and be sure to thank them for their time. Don't be turned off by a wrestler saying no or ignoring you. He probably lost his match and is is no mood for pictures. The Lower ranking wrestlers will be walking to and from the arena. That's the best time to catch a picture with them. I am always surprised how humble the wrestlers are. Some wrestlers will smile and even joke with you!if you're new to Sumo, a tour with a guide is easily the best way to experience it. But. You can do it on your own!One last thing: it's a long day, so you may want to bring snacks with you. The concession stands can completely sell out of bento lunch boxes, so You can get pretty hungry by the end of the day. I bring in snacks in my small backpack without a problem. Oh yeah flying your pillow and the end of a match that was really good or, the last match of the day you will see pillows flying, officially this is a no no. But when Rome!! Also when the last match ends don't be in a rush to leave. There is actually a closing ceremony that is performed. It is worth watching.Have fun! Interact with the he locals next to you this is a fun sport and you will enjoy being among the locals and watching their national sport."

This is a great experience and not just for the Sumo aficionado.It is theatre not just a contest (albeit serious).Best advice is to make sure you get some background for what you are watching because even though we had watched Sumo before (on television) understanding the back story is important in appreciating what you are watching.First we went for Three days but the first day was with a tour company (Viator) and the guide supplied a cheat sheet on each contestant which we were able to use at each of the other two days.Second I recommend you do get the little wireless to get the English translation for the main matches from 4pm. Again to help with context.Third if possible you go for tickets in the first three rows on level2 (level 1 is the ground floor) if not at least in the lower section of level 2. There are no bad seats but it gets a little remote up the back.All in all not to be missed uniquely Japanese."

We saw one of the first couple of days of the tournament in May 2016 and it was one of the highlights of our entire trip.As I'd seen others recommend, we arrived a little after lunch when the higher ranked matches start and despite my partner saying \"I don't think we'll stay to the end\" (it was about 4 hours away) we actually did stay until the last match because it was that good.I'm not much of a sports person, but I think because the matches are so quick and you can never tell who will win just based on their size, it definitely held our attention the whole time. I also like the idea that while it is a contact sport, it's not anywhere near as violent as many other sports.The arena itself has very good seating all over, so you can always see what's going on, however I would recommend getting seating in the lowest portion of the second level - we had tickets a little up from that section, and while we could still see everything, we definitely will pay a little more to get a little closer next time.Highly recommend this as it's an experience unique to Japan and very entertaining."

It doesn't get busy until after three when the better sumo's fight. The sport dates back approx 2 thousand years and there is a lot of tradition to this sport. Whilst the wrestle usually lasts no longer than fifteen seconds it's very exciting to watch and the lead up to the fight is where you will see a lot of the tradition and rituals. I think I'll start watching sumo on tv/internet when I return home from my trip, I looked up the full history of sumo because I had such a great day. If you can time a trip to Japan when the tournaments are on it is Definately worth it. There are six each year due to the popularity of sumo, do your research in advance because this is a must !!"

We bought our tickets a month in advance for 3,800 yen per person, and we got seats all the way at the high back, but it was fine so long as you remember two things: (1) binoculars and (2) you can just sit in the seats that are \"reserved\" on the second floor but closest to the ring until the people fill in at about 3:40 PM, or when the best wrestlers start to go to the ring. People are usually pretty nice about it.The stadium itself is also a museum, and has lots of souvenirs on sale, though they're at pretty high prices. Lots of foreigners came, which was cool to see - they wanted the sumo experience, too! I actually got pretty into the experience, especially when Ishiura won: he was a small guy but managed to shove the big guy out of the ring! Watching the last three matches (the ones with the yokozuna, the best fighters [all three are from Mongolia]) was incredibly interesting, and the audience went wild.The sumo wrestlers spend a lot of time trying to intimidate each other and getting as ready as can be, making eye contact and taunting, but once they go at each other, it's so much fun to watch. Good fighters go on from about 2:15 PM, and the best ones start around 3:40 PM. It lasted until 6 PM for us, and four hours was just enough time, methinks; not too much and not too little!"

By 3.30pm the venue was really starting to fill up, seats on the second level are much more comfortable and offer a bird's eye view. The venue states that you cannot bring outside food or drinks, however this rule did not appear to be enforced.

There is an English NHK commentary available that makes the experience a lot more enjoyable.

This is a fantastic way to spend a cold afternoon.Our family of 4 took a box at the Sumo thinking it would be worth popping in fair an hour or so. Four hours later, we left thoroughly entertained. The box was just big enough for a family of 4, as long as the kids aren't too big. Very comfy for 2 people, but possibly a bit tight for 4 larger adults.It is a relaxed atmosphere, and you can come and go as you please. The food is great and you can eat & drink in your box. You can see all of the action from the c class box, which is a little cheaper.The sumo itself was fantastic. I am not really all that into sport, but the whole psychology, ceremony and physicality of the event was incredible. Make sure you duck out the back of the souvenir stands to see the big blokes walking in to the stadium. They are awesome! "

This arena hosts sumo wrestling competitions 3 times a year, lasting 14 days each time, so check the calendar if you are going to Japan on a leisure trip. The matches start at 8 am and keep on until 6 pm at a relentless pace with next two bouting pairs lined up at all times. This is something all ages and men and women can enjoy together. It is very interesting to watch the bouts and the rituals around it. Make a bet to enjoy it more. I would recommend to splash out on a box seat on ground level which is dimensioned for 4 people, but realistically only fits 2 Westerners.Then for lunch, go to top floor and have Japanese food. There was a bit of a queue when we arrived at 1130, but cleared fairly quickly. It was probably the best Japanese food we had during our 2 week trip.Then at the end, you can watch the sumo wrestlers come and go from the arena. There was quite a big crowd when we were there and you can do that even if you dont have any tickets to the arena also. To see the wrestlers up close gives you an idea of how massive (and tall) some of them are. And many are not Japanese either.We went on a weekday 2/3 into the competition and it was not so many people there in the morning, but then when the higher divisions start in the afternoon there were more people arriving."

The bottom half of the audience sits on the floor on thin cushions which got uncomfortable for me in about 20 minutes since I'm not used to it. We spent time on the second level where my assigned seats were which I actually preferred not just for having a regular chair with food tray attached but the angle made the sumo matches easy to watch.During the sumo tournament there are vendors selling souvenirs and food. The nice thing about the shirts is that sizes go all the way to XXXL, which makes sense since I bet majority of sumo wear Rick Ross sizes themselves. The food is real basic snacks, the prices are reasonable, but bringing your own snacks and food into the stadium (which is allowed) is a much better option. They do however have a restaurant on the second floor that serves Japanese Food including the Sumo Stable Food called Chanko Nabe. The sumo tournament itself is fun to watch, all the matches from about 3pm to 6pm the crowd really gets into. In between matches however be prepared for monotonous/redundant chanting along with ritualistic stuff. The Japanese are an ancient society, despite being modern they feel strongly about tradition and you really see that in the tournament. Important Tip: the men's bathroom on the second floor have toilets. First floor requires squatting."

There are three annually at the T\u014dky\u014d stadium which seats 13,000 people. there are plenty of food stalls and souvenirs are available. The museum which is normally open to the public is only open to paying spectators during tournaments. Tickets really should be bought in advance via the Sumo Association's website as they are usually sold out. There are english speaking volunteers at the gates to guide you through how to get your pre purchased tickets from the ticket dispensing machines. The top ranking riskishi (wrestlers) start arriving at the South gate at 2pm and this is a good photo opportunity. From 2pm onward the stadium starts to fill up as the top ranking wrestlers take to the dohyo (ring) and take part in ceremonials before they start to wrestle. This continues till around 6pm. There are people who carry pressurized beer containers around the stadium seating so you can purchase a beer at your seat. English language guides are available to make the experience more enjoyable and English language radio commentary from 4pm onwards."

I recommend taking the ticket for the 3rd stage sheet at the Second floor because better view than the tail end of first floor. Especially you can take a comfortable own sheet more than the first floor. The First floor sheets are narrow space and high cost. Sumo has a lot of fine rules and nice cultures more than you see, I recommend taking a guide with you. The Chanko is daily changed, it will be popular and long line but you should be in the line and eat it, very good. Probably 200 yen about.I liked an ice cream of Hiyonoyama, it is good. Hiyonoyama is a mascot character of Sumo, it's cute!"

Our five-year old son was quite interested in what was going on and we managed to stay for around 3 hours, with a short break and walk up the street about halfway through.The day we went was sold-out. The arena opens at 8am but we arrived at around 1:30pm. Go to Ryogoku (E12) metro station and take exit 3. Follow the signs for the Edo Tokyo museum (the big ship like building) and walk down the side of it. You will see the traditional green stadium roof behind. It\u2019s fairly easy to find.We booked our tickets online on the day they went on sale through the official website which linked to Oosumo tickets. It was all in English although we weren\u2019t quite sure which row our seats were in until we got there. We chose the seated section (Arena) section A. It cost 25500 yen for 3 tickets. We were in the 3rd row and had excellent views. The mats on the floor below looked cool, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be comfortable for very long.You must take the credit card that you paid for your tickets with, as well as the ticket number, to get your actual tickets from a machine. There were no queues to collect tickets when we arrived, despite it being sold-out. We did have a bit of difficulty finding our seats because the tickets are mostly written in Japanese \u2013 so it was a case of \u2018match the symbol to the one on the door\u2019. The seat numbers are written in Western numbers though and were easy to find once we found the correct door. Our son had a notebook and some pens as well as a bag of snacks to keep him occupied when his attention to the sumo did wane. The people around us were very tolerant. It\u2019s a happy atmosphere and my son seemed to be most welcome, although we didn\u2019t see any other children there.Sumo is quite a spectacle. The banner displays, and the pre-bout manoeuvring and salt throwing between the two wrestlers takes far longer than the actual wrestle \u2013 with some bouts over in about 5 seconds once they started. I don\u2019t think we saw any that lasted more than 30 seconds. We saw a few sumos land on top of the judges in the front row. It\u2019s quite colourful and the crowd really gets into it, cheering on their favourites.There are souvenir stalls and food outlets around the venue. We bought popcorn and drinks but you can get hot Japanese meals as well. We walked up the street to the Seven Eleven to stock up on snacks half-way through. You are allowed one pass-out. You can eat inside the stadium while watching the wrestlers.Check out the \u2018toilet flushing noise\u2019 button in the toilets \u2013 it does nothing except make a toilet flushing noise. (One of those \u2018only in Japan\u2019 moments.)Sumos are generally happy to pose for photos in and around the stadium although I wouldn\u2019t interrupt them on their way in to wrestle. You can watch them arrive if you go outside on the ground floor, and take photos of them in their Yukutas.You can also take photos (no flash) inside the stadium.We didn\u2019t stay until the very end because I was dreading how crowded the metro platform would be once the sumo had finished. But we saw enough to make it worthwhile. We saw the entrance ceremonies for the grandmasters and the next level down. You will be given a leaflet in English which shows who is wrestling and the approximate times for them making their entry (when all the sumos get up on the ring and raise their hands). Worth seeing and hearing the crowd cheer.Sumo is only on at certain times of the year \u2013 so check out in advance if it\u2019s on when you are in Japan, and when the tickets go on sale.We don\u2019t usually watch any sport, but this was one of the highlights of our holiday!"

This had English commentary from 4:30pm onwards and this was invaluable for us as it really allowed us to get into the spirit and understand what is going on. Would definitely go again!"

General admission seats are in the top row but it's still easy enough to see the action. There are matches non stop until 5.30/6ish so my advice would be to go in and reserve a decent seat (everybody appears to just put a programme down), watch a few of the games and then leave the grounds (make sure to get stamped) before returning around 2.45 for the big boys. I stayed all day and was very drained by the end of it so its best to go elsewhere. As a sumo first timer I did find it a little difficult to understand what was going on but it was thoroughly enjoyable!!"

This was definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Japan. So interesting and thrilling to see these big fighters practicing a sport that has remained largely unchanged for so many years. I recommend reading about the meaning of the rituals, the history of the sport, and how the rankings work while you're there. I also found that info in the website. Purchase your tickets online cause they go fast and it's always sold out."

Pre-plan to buy the limited tickets for the tournament so you don't miss out if you know you'll be around when a tournament is on. The dates and ticket information can all be found online. If you didn't score a ticket tickets can be purchased on the day. There is a limit of 350 tickets sold at 8am and unfortunately for us it was a public holiday on the day we attempted to purchase tickets. Arriving at 7am we missed out on tickets by 6 people in the line! Some days you can still purchase tickets after 9 but every day would be different so I recommend going early. You are allowed one re-entry so purchase them, go about your day and come back around 3 when the better matches begin."

Having looked at the website when we first planned this trip, we came prepared, having pre-booked our tickets within hours of the tickets becoming available. Even so we got some of the last, so make sure you book as early as possible!! We got the cheapest available seats as we weren't sure whether we would enjoy the sumo or not. As it turns out it was fascinating to watch and follow, even though we didn't get the English commentary. Most things were either fairly self explanatory, or easily explained with a little pre=visit research. The cheap seats are incredibly high up so if you don't like heights they're probably not a good choice, but they do still give you a good view of everything that is going on, and you feel very much a part of events. Both my husband and I really enjoyed our afternoon at the sumo and would thoroughly recommend that if you can, you should try to go! Having said that, the group behind us got quite bored, getting irritated with the rituals and ceremonies that accompanied each bout. Personally I loved it, for an afternoon.The two best groups of sumo wrestlers don't arrive or start their bouts until about 2pm so there is plenty of time to use your ticket that also gives you entry to the museum next door (this is free outside of tournament times but only ticket holders can get in when the tournaments are being held).We weren't sure whether there would be food available at the arena and if there was, how expensive it would be. It was a nice surprise that there was a wide range with bento boxes from around 1400 yen and snacks from about 300 yen. I had the fried noodles for 400 yen and they were lovely!Quick Tip: Arrive and depart using the Toei Oedo Line rather than the JR Line. It may be 10 minutes closer on foot but you will be fighting for space, especially on the return journey!"

We were in Tokyo on Day 8 of the May competition, and watched it for 5 hours without losing interest. I was hesitant to go earlier in the day because I had heard the more professional levels don't appear until 3:30pm but the lower-level bouts were still very interesting. In fact, possibly more interesting since you could get wild mis-matches in size between wrestlers, and it's always good value to watch a man the size of two fridges square off against a man the size of a small truck. :-)Food didn't seem cheap in there - we bought snacks at Family Mart before entry. You can hire English radio translations in there if they're available, for a refundable deposit of 2000 yen and a total fee of only 100 yen. When we arrived, we were told they were all in use and to return at 2:30pm. I went back at 2:40pm and they were all gone again, so I never found out what was available - no matter, you can easily work it out without assistance.I recommend a chair seat not only for the comfort but also because the people in the floor seats are only located about 6-8 inches higher than the people in front of them (which could give you a bad view). Also, the complexity of getting cross-legged into a small space meant many people took a long time to sit down, blocking the view of those behind them."

There were also photographs of famous Sumo wrestlers and you can buy a booklet that explains all about the Sumo tradition, ranking and rules for a very reasonable JPY100 (that's GB\u00a30.60)!There are some nice paintings of Sumo on the outside of the Kokugikan. You only need about 1/2 an hour here but it's well worth it and gives an insight and taste of the great tradition of Sumo."

It did get a bit long at times so would suggest not an all afternoon event and it's worthwhile getting some back ground on the ceremony.

But we were front row against the rails with no one in front of us.Whisky highball and tayaki , what better way to spend and afternoon with the family.

We usually buy box seating which is very close to the center stage. They are on the expensive side and they are supposed to seat four people. But if you are tall, I would recommend a max of three adults per box. This last time, the boxes next to us had four tall adults and they looked miserable! Since you seat on the floor, you have to keep your knees bent at all times and it becomes very uncomfortable after a while. Also, if you are going to see sumo for the first time (for the experience of being in Japan), you should buy less expensive seats. It's not worth spending a lot of money to be bored and in pain. On the other hand, being at Kokugikan is very exciting, and rooting for your favorite wrestler is a lot of fun!"

However, in the end, given it was early in the competition, we decided to wait until we were in Japan. We bought our tickets from one of the many Seven Elevens (you can also buy them from other supermarkets as well but if you don't speak Japanese, you will need the help of someone who does to enter your ticket requests into the machine). As for the Sumo, it is pure theatre! We arrived at about 1.30 and the time flew by until it was time to go at 6.00. Our only slight criticism was about the English commentary of the event. We rented the radios for a very reasonable price of 100 yen each, once your 2,000 deposit is returned). However, although we obtained the radio at 2.30 (the earliest you can get one) the commentary didn't start until 4.00 and then what you are listening to is the television coverage (rather than coverage that is aimed for the radio). Also if were to do it again, we would bring our own headphones, as we found the ones provided (they sit in the ear) to be a bit uncomfortable after a few hours). But overall, a great experience, one not to be missed."

Very fortunate to have randomly chosen the day of the semi finals. Our guide was a lovely lady with the most sunny & positive personality. She explained details that otherwise would have been completely lost on us, from the history of sumo, to the rituals, rankings & rules. Radios playing english audio also helped but we didnt actually rely on them as much as I thought we would. We booked the tour as a purely 'touristy' experience & had no real prior knowledge of the sport. Despite this we were completely swept up by the excitement of the crowd and the amazing display of strength, strategy & seemingly impossible agility by the sumo. The crowd enthusiasm was infectious, especially knowing that Japan had not had a yokozuna (grand champion) in some years, so one of the sumos had become a fan favourite as he was Japan's best chance at claiming the title. The bouts are quite short so you don't really have time to get bored (being a non sporty person, I thought that might be an issue). There are also roving beer & pizza sellers that roam the stands, which saves you from having to leave your seat. Souvenir stalls provide plentiful options. While not cheap I did not come across similar sumo themed souvenirs in our travels so was glad to pick up an item while we were there. Surprisingly it turned out being one of the highlights of our trip and I'm very glad that we ended up going!"

At the beginning the stadium was quite empty as it began with the low ranking matches but it helped us get a good idea of the concept. The stadium begins to fill up more when the higher ranked matches begin. Even though all the commentary is in Japanese it is easy to pick up the concept of it all.

It was nice seeing the Japanese audience interactions before fights begin, I didn\u2019t understand what was being said but you sort of get the idea. The sumos in general are treated like celebrities with hordes of groupies waiting and stalking them, it was surreal! There are betting stands as well but you\u2019ll need a strong command of the Language to manage your way through that or a guide. The stadium grounds are not really that big but they are colourful with lots of wall portraits. There were some great souvenir stands around the arena .  I Could have easily spent four to six hours here but I gave it 2 and half hours (sort of got repetitive) and decided to head to the superior Edo-Tokyo Museum (literally next door and a must see!) Sumo is seasonal so plan and book for tickets ahead because they sell out quite quickly especially during the finals, best way to purchase them is through their official website, http://sumo.pia.jp/en/The ticket prices depends on your seating, I got the least expensive arena seats (Y 2000 + a 1000 service charge) on the second floor, didn\u2019t have a problem viewing the action and well worth a visit. Upon completion of the purchase an invoice will be sent to your email address, during match day you\u2019ve got to bring a print out of the invoice and use a special automated kiosk to the right of the ticket stands and exchange them for tickets ( be sure to bring the same credit card you used to purchase the tickets online)."

I know that the seats in the upper area (more stadium style) are cheaper, and probably would have been fine, but I found it totally worth the price to be down closer, sitting in the \"typical\" boxes. We also rented the radios they have so you can listen to the English broadcast of the later \"main\" matches. We rented two, but found that they actually interfered with each other, so we only used one and just shared the earbuds.

Seeing a sumo match was one of the best things I did in Tokyo. I've split my review into the event and then tickets, seating and getting there. 1) I arrived at 2.30 although you can get there for 8am but the morning is for low ranked wrestlers. If you do go early you are allowed to leave and re-enter, so you could go visit the Edo museum next door or grab lunch as there weren't many decent eating options (or bring your own food). On arrival I first rented an English audio guide for 100 Yen with 2000 Yen deposit. Before getting to my seat I waited in the side alley where the wrestlers enter the stadium and are applauded by the awaiting fans. It also allows a good photo opportunity close up. At 4 PM the top ranked wrestlers enter the arena and are introduced to the crowd. It was a good atmosphere especially for the later bouts and I found it really interesting with the pre fight rituals and subtle psyching out. The final bout was about 6 PM and rounded off a great experience. 2) I bought my tickets online at buysumotickets.com about a week before the event and had them delivered to my hotel. If ordering early they also ship to your home address. A really good efficient service from them for a small handling fee. In terms of the seats you can have \"Box\" or \"Arena\" seats, with box being Japanese style mats which you sit cross legged on and are for groups up to 6 people. Box seats are the lower level. I went for an Arena seat which is upper tier and are normal western style chairs. Cat A is the first 6 rows, Cat B are rows 7-11 and Cat C is 13-15. I went for Cat B which still provided a good view and had sufficient leg room but in hindsight I would have paid more and got the Cat A which are closer and more \"comfy\" as this is a one off experience. To get to the stadium go to Ryogoku (E12) station on the metro and take exit 3. The stadium is directly behind the Edo museum. In summary a classic Japanese experience that should not be missed. Enjoy!"

Even if you are not a fan of wrestling or sumo, I would definitely recommend watching a sumo match if you are in Japan during a sumo tournament and are able to get tickets. Attending a sumo tournament is a very unique and fun experience full of tradition. Some tips:Sumo matches in Tokyo only take place for two weeks in January, May and September.Can purchase tickets online from abroad. We purchased them from the official website.Purchase tickets early, especially for weekend matches or if want to sit near the front.There are 2 types of seats \u2013arena chair seats and floor seats where you sit on a cushion. All seats in the stadium offer a good view though.While the tournament runs from 8am to 6pm you are able to enter any time-most people show up after 2pm but if you want to take pictures or sit in a better seat get there early.For more tips and advice about how to book tickets, where to sit, when to arrive and more, check out http://www.thetravelsisters.com/tips-for-watching-sumo-in-japan/.Sumo was one of my favorite experiences in Tokyo."

The main sumo wrestlers were paraded in after the lower tier bouts were finished. This was fantastic.

            "review": "Fantastic tournament. The Sumo seasons are very specific depending on which city you are in. but you can find information relating to the tournaments on many internet sites. We went to the Kokugikan to watch the current tournament and this was very easy to do on our own. We bought the tickets from our local 7 - 11 convenience store. The staff in there were very helpful and talked us through which buttons to press to get our tickets. One word of warning - there are primarily two types of seats. \"Boxes with cushions\" which are nearer the ring but involves sitting on your knees/cross legged for the entire duration - not easy for us Westerners. Or proper theatre type seats - the more you pay the bigger the seat - more legroom etc. That said, everywhere affords a great view. Whilst the tournament runs from 8am through to 6pm the best time to get there is probably around 1.30pm. This will give you time to go to the South Gate to see the Sumo wrestlers arrive. There are cheers and applause as the big stars walk in. Then take your seat for the opening ceremony & matches of the middle ranked players at around 14.20. The same for the big boys starts at around 15.45. There is some excellent pamphlets in English to help you with understanding Sumo plus a small museum. There are places to buy food & drink but we took in our own picnic no problem. If you cannot visit during a tournament we're told you can go in to look around and just next door is the Edo-Tokyo museum. Not entirely sure we understood the rules nor who was the winner, but this experience was absolutely fantastic and a great way to enjoy the essence of Japan"

It had lots of wrestling before and after of course.It was packed full of people standing outside the gates just before the doors opened. You could watch the sumo wrestlers walk along the streets to the stadium which I thought was pretty cool. Many people were taking photos of them. When you get inside, the wrestlers are all standing in the lobby so you can take a picture WITH them as well.We sat in the Arena B section and it was still a very good view. If you want good pictures, bring a telephoto lense. All seats in the arena provide a good view from the 2nd floor. The fights were pretty quick for each round. The later fights were much more entertaining and lasted a lot longer than the earlier fights (higher ranked wrestlers compete later in the event). You can bring your own food in, but there is food to purchase inside as well. Lots of food was sold out about 2/3 into the event, so you might want to purchase early. There is a takoyaki stand inside as well.Location is near the Edo museum which is good because you could do both in one day. We spent our morning/afternoon until about 3-4 pm (when the event ended) at the sumo stadium and then went to to Edo museum for about 2 hours. It was sufficient time."

I purchased tickets in advance thru buysumotickets.com (good website) and requested the very first row in the arena 'A' seating for the January 16th match and got a great seat, right on the edge of the balcony, and a chair back instead of a cushion to sit on. I arrived at 9:30 am and watched some of the apprentice matches till about 11:30. Hardly anyone was there so I was able to wander around the arena and take some photos. I decided to leave and go to the Tsujiki fish market for lunch. You are allowed to leave and return once a day, and I had an enjoyable meal of high quality sushi. Many places to eat, all priced very reasonably. I headed back to the arena and had no problem getting readmitted to see the afternoon tournaments. Around 2pm the arena became more crowded as the journeymen wrestlers paraded around the ring wearing their aprons and a measurably better exhibition of sumo wrestling began. While no match I saw lasted a full minute, and most only seconds, the outcomes and wrestlers were cheered and applauded from the ever growing crowd.Finally, about 4:30 the masters started, with the parade to the ring in their aprons, posturing, purifying the ring with salt, and a quick rub with a wet washcloth, these guys were ready to go.It was a fun way for me to spend a day in Tokyo, but then, I like Sumo. I'm sure it's not for everybody, but it was fun. If you want to see the best, and have limited time, I'd suggest coming in the afternoon when the better wrestlers are scheduled."

Our colleagues took us to the Arena to buy tickets as this proved pretty complicated on-line. We were given the option of buying tickets for Y8,000 with a credit card on the first tier quite a few rows back, but then the ticket agent said if we paid cash we could have some tickets that the wrestlers themselves wanted to sell for cash. We took that option, and found ourselves sitting at the front of the 1st tier on lace covered chairs, quite the VIP treatment. The view was amazing, and the tournament itself was very impressive.This is something that you have to do, its very 'old school', but you get the feeling that you are involved in something very special. You had no idea who was fighting who as everything was written in Japanese, we received a sheet of who was fighting who, but had to ask a spectator close by to explain who was who and which fight we were watching, (she spoke zero English), once that was clear we followed quite easily!.The stadium itself is very impressive, its easy to move around, food and drink was easily available, prices were fine, not a rip off like stadiums in Europe or the USA.This is something you should do."

            "review": "Sumo Tournament with Children and Seat Reviews. First off, let me preface this review about the arena seating. Nearly every seat has an excellent view, because the arena is fairly small. So you don't have to pay top money for box seats or front upper level. I have seen Sumo twice at this stadium and both times have been great experiences.Here is the breakdown, box seats are most expensive and are just mats you sit on and start at approx 10,000 yen per person for the back and then go up in price as you get closer to the ring. No chairs, just the floor and a small mat. Then you have the 2nd level with four different sections, Arena Chairs A, B, C and general admission. Section A has nice movie theater style seats with little trays for food and drinks (about 8500 yen per ticket). Section B has the same seats with no tray (about 5000 yen). Section C has smaller seats and not as cushioned (about 3700 yen).The general admission is the last row and only sold on the day of the tournaments. The whole upper sections has a total of only 18 rows, so the sight difference is not much between front and backs of section.Now if you have kids, i think it is fine to bring any aged child, never that loud in there. My kids enjoyed it in fact. Under age 3 does not need a ticket (but has to sit on lap). There is plenty of legroom for them to \"move\" around, because we all know it is hard to still still for five or more hours.I would always sit in Arena Chairs B, simply because they are comfortable, lots of leg room, even for American standards, and still great sights for children to see and move around.The food selections are somewhat limited with mostly Japanese foods and things like hot dogs and French fries. However you can leave the tournament once with reentry, so you could eat at one of the many places nearby. In addition, you can bring your own food and drinks into the stadium, which is a plus for people with kids.If you do not want to be there all day, I suggest getting there at around 1330-1400, that's when the pros start and it gets more lively. It all finishes at around 1800 (6pm).For transportation, the train is the best bet as the Ryogoku train station is right next to the stadium. From Hachioji, Tachikawa, Ome, Yokosuka or Fussa areas, it is approximately 55-75 minutes by train, depending on starting point. If you are coming from the Yokohama, Saitama or Chiba areas, it is only about 40-45 mins by train. If you are staying in Shinjuku or Tokyo, it is only 15 mins by train. Driving is not really an option as for there is no parking at or around the stadium.So to review, best seats are Arena Chairs Section B, you can bring children with no issues, and you can bring food inside on your own. And lastly, many of the workers speak English and are very helpful."

There is so much to write about sumo, but even if you have a short time for a taste of the action, it is worth the trip. The wrestlers show they are more than heavy guys in loin cloths, they have a spirituality, a respect for their profession (OK, you may have some arguements here), and an agility that is striking. If you can arrange for it, there are stands that sell meals that you can take to your seats. If you purchase a lower level seat, you can sit close to the action until the crowd arrives during the Juryo matches. Many who attend get hooked, and become lifelong sumophiles. Not to be missed!"

And then the actual \"wrestling\", which is more like fighting. These guys slap the crap out of each other, choke each other out, and throw each other off of the meter-high sumo platform, so that they fall smashing into the audience. see a 400-pound man get launched 10 feet off a platform into the crowd is quite the spectacle.

People cheer for their favorite wrestlers, take pictures and wish them good luck. We found our box which was about 15 feet from the ring. It fit four people, but if you are a big person, it would be uncomfortable. You sit on the floor on a thin cushion (cushions that you see people throwing when a high ranking wrestler suffers an upset) and after a few hours, you can definitely feel it. You can also order food and drinks throughout the matches. The best sumo wrestlers come in the end and the matches are fast and exciting! You are never bored. Highly recommend it!"

We chose \"A\" seats--the front-most section with regular chairs (below that you sit on the floor--closer to the action, but less comfortable). You will pay a premium to buy online, but the tickets sell out fast, so don't wait. The matches go on all day, but the top division bouts occur from 4-6pm. So show up around 3:15-3:30, stand outside and watch the wrestlers arrive at the stadium, then take your seats in time for the 3:45 ceremony. Definitely pick up an English audio set, as there are English-speaking commentators (from 4-6pm only), and you'll be lost without it. Each contender has a match each day for 15 consecutive days, so there are no semis or finals. By the end of the 21 matches during the 2-hour time period (about 5 minutes each, including about 20 seconds of actual wrestling), we understood some of the strategy and terminology. We were lucky enough to be there on the second-to-last day, and saw the two as-yet-undefeated contenders wrestle each other, an awesome (and lengthy) match. Since both still had to wrestle one more match the following day to determine the winner (or whether there would have to be a playoff), we (my husband, two college-age kids, and I) were excited enough to return to our hotel by 4:00 the next day to watch the final round on television. Highly recommend if you are in town for one of the tournaments."

We had bought tickets on line and started with a tour guide at Hamamatsucho Station, trained it to Ryogokan Station and into the throngs of people heading towards the stadium. Some of the sumo wrestlers were also arriving through the crowds so we had a close-up view. The local fans were there to cheer them on and many were waiting to see their favourites arrive.We went into the stadium and the foyer was buzzing with people. At the end was a showcase with all of the trophies on offer \u2013 the Emporers Cup, another huge one looked like the Davis Cup, and others. We went up to the second floor and all found our seats. Really good visibility and lighting. Some of the Juryo bouts were on so we watched those including the slight Czech sumo who was pitted against the largest of the fighters and beat him quickly and easily much to the crowds delight.We slipped out and bought some yakitori and a beer. The guide was a real sumo freak and she had done lots of homework for us. She had a book made up with all of the matched fighters for the day\u2019s bouts with their pictures and stats so we could follow it more closely. Must admit we hogged the book for more that our fair share of the time. Before the Makuuchi bouts (the top group) there was a ceremony where all of the contestants come out into the ring, and another where the two Yokuzunas with their aprons with huge ropes and bows for adornment put on a bit of a theatrical greeting and the crowd loved it, especially the bit where they individually do a sort of moonwalk shuffle thing with their legs spread either side of the two white lines.There was another ceremony for the two new sumos that had been admitted and their supersized painted portraits were unveiled remotely to join the others in the gallery which runs around the very high ceiling to the arena.Radios are available for hire so that you can listen to the NHK commentary in English after 4 pm when the Makuuchi bouts begin.We had watched sumo on TV before in Japan when on holiday and had a few favourites, Kootooshu, Baruto and Hakuho and they just happened to all win on the day.We can recommend going to anyone even if you aren\u2019t that interested in sumo. The spectacle of unique sporting event and the pageantry rooted in the Shinto samurai culture is wonderful."

We were on the second level which had proper seats and had a good view. We spent half a day there which was enough for a first-timer. It's easy to get to the stadium - same subway as the Edo-Tokyo Museum, go up the steps to the Museum and down the other side and you are a couple of minutes away from the Sumo Stadium."

I highly recommend the softserve ice cream :) if you want a taste of chanko nabe (sumo wrestlers' stew), proceed to the basement.kokugikan is just outside ryogoku station. during tournament time, many wrestlers use the train to get to stadium, and you may be lucky to share a platform or car with them."

The Japanese love their sumo wrestling as the seats on the first level do get booked out way ion advanced especially over the weekends, but if you are in town - do try to spend a few hours of the late afternoon watching the champions wrestle.Doors open at about 8AM and the day starts off with the amateurs wrestling. If you've bought your tickets online via the Oosumo website, you can collect your tickets from 10AM. If you were wondering - \"hey, the match starts at 8AM but I'm missing 2 hours of the start !\" don't fret because hardly anyone is there exept for the match judges and wrestlers at 8-11 AM. The stadium will start to fill just before the champions start to wrestle which is around 3:45-4PM. Even the NHK English broadcasts of the day's match starts at 4PM. You can rent a little portable radio at the information counter from 2:30PM and costs 100 yen with a fully refundable 2000 yen deposit.Ringside seats are usually sold out way before but if you can - go for the 1st level \"B box\" seats for two or for four persons for a better view of the action.Getting there is easy as the stadium is close to the JR and subway stations.The only disappointment was the stadium's restaurant on the second level. Although inexpensive, the food tasted pretty bad. So bring your own bento or buy one from the many shops near the entrance to the arena.Although you could buy tickets on the day itself, 1st floor box seats for two usually sell out quickly as the day of the match approaches - so if you're going to watch the event as a pair, do buy your tickets in advance as there aren't many of such seats available. Plebs like me could forget about the ringside seats as they're usually booked out well in advanced by well connected persons.The match becomes increasingly exciting when the arena starts getting packed and the atmosphere more electric as the clock marches towards 6PM. Do be there by 2 PM to witness the crowd of Japanese fans lining the Southern entrance to welcome their favourite elite wrestlers prior to the \"ring ceremony\" by these same champions. 2:00 PM is the time the locals start turning up, so if you need to do something else in the morning; by all means don't feel that you've missed out on much at all. The match day ends with a \"bow ceremony\" at 6PM and drumming from the drum tower to exhort the crowd to return again the next time."

So to actually be at Kokugian Sumo Stadium on the weekend seeing the big boys in action was an almost surreal experience for me. Like many people, I assumed it would be easy to get Sumo tickets but later realised that tournaments only take place in Tokyo 3 times a year so opportunities to see them are limited and require pre-planning.Ticket prices enable you to see a full day of bouts. Doors open at 8am. The earlier bouts starting from 8:30am are for the more junior lower ranked wrestlers so if you are limited for time, I would recommend arriving early afternoon. Different seats are available. Some are in boxes requiring you to sit on a pillow on the floor and others are seated options. What I loved was actually bumping into the sumo wrestlers (rikishi) outside the stadium on their way to the competition, dressed in their yukata robes. Most of them were happy to have their photo taken. Apparently they start arriving from 2pm at the South Gate. There are plenty of snacks and drinks available for purchase at the stadium and some stalls with banners outside the arena which is only a 3 minute walk around the corner from Ryogoku Stadium. The train station has sumo paintings and other sumo material to see as you exit the train.The bouts themselves are actually very short and can last between 3-6 minutes each. There is a lot of posturing, leg thumping, squatting, mouth washing and salt throwing in the lead up to the actual wrestling component- all part of the tradition which makes it enthralling to watch. To win the bout, the rikishi has to have one part of his opponent's body enter outside the circle ring on the clay sumo ring called the Dohyo. It can be as much as a finger tip or toe- so not necessary to push the opponent all the way out of the ring to win- although at times this does happen when you see one competitor pushed off the ring completely. The final bouts are for the very senior rikishi and the champions.Also during the afternoon there are 2 sumo ceremonies where the rikishi enter the ring wearing ceremonial aprons and form a circle on the sumo ring. They go through a short ritual act before leaving in single file. There are some great photo opportunities during these ceremonies! The concluding part of the day is the bow dance where a specially picked rikishi is handed a gold bow and then does an amazing twirling routine.The venue itself is great- viewing is good from most places although I think the bottom level is better. There are plenty of toilet and refreshment and souvenier facilities. There are also really informative booklets available in the foyer in English that explain the tradition, rules and history of sumo that I highly recommend you read before the bouts.The venue has a Museum exhibition room which can be viewed for free by ticket holders. There are plenty of restaurants in the area near the train station for a meal before or after the tournament."

The Sumida stadium is a short walk from the Ryogoku stations on the JR and Oedo lines. You can get a reserved seat for as little as 3600 yen on the day of a tournament. Just buy it at the gate where there are lots of helpful staff. Ticket numbers include a row, seat, and Chinese character for North, South, East, or West. If you wish you can rent a radio with BBC English language commentary for 100 yen plus a 2000 yen refundable deposit, but the matches are pretty self-explanatory. The highest rank Makuuchi matches start at 3:45 p.m. Buy a beer at one of the stands and sit back to enjoy an incredible Japanese sport with religious overtones. For 250 yen you can indulge in a bowl of chankonabe stew, the meal of champions, at a restaurant near the entrance. Definitely a fine way to spend an afternoon in Tokyo."

As for seating, if you don't mind sitting on the floor then get the premium box (can seat 4-6). If you prefer traditional chairs, they are available but further from the ring.

Each time I have been here I have been drawn to watch Sumo on the local TV. it is truly fascinating. I am addicted and as a female I am on my own amongst my friends:) it is rich in tradition and ceremony and gives a great taste of one aspect of the Japanese culture. If you have the chance go and see it \"live\".Tickets are best purchased on line before you leave. the tickets go on sale approx a month before the Basho ( comp ) starts. There are 4 Basho per year but not all are in Tokyo. the January tournament is always in Tokyo at the Ryogoku Kokugikan ( Sumo stadium ). You can check details at Nihon sumo kyokai website.Unless you are happy to sit on floor cushions for a couple of hours, you are best to get seats on the 2nd floor (2F on map ). Viewing is great from this position. You can hire a radio at the stadium that you can tune into the English commentary or maybe bring your own radio and tune in yourself. The hire is 100 yen with a 2000 Yen deposit.Plan to be seated by 3pm and you will see some of the Juryo division and be there for the ceremony introducing the senior wrestlers Makkuchi division at about 1545. The day will finish at 1800hrs.The stadium is right across the road from Ryogoku station and directly in front of the Tokyo-Edo museum. There is a small Sumo museum in the stadium area."

Plenty of small restaurants around the area as the food in the stadium is pretty average with some sushi packs the best option.

I've never been that interested but after seeing the size of these blokes, their explosive power and the way the locals get into it, we had a lot of fun. Imagine a typical die hard footy fan yelling at their favourite player and that's what the locals do. It was pretty cool. Just a tip though, it's not cheap and we booked four seats as we have two teenage boys. The four seats consist of four pillows on the floor in a square sort of caged section that you get to yourself. So if you can't sit on your butt on a pillow for an extended period get the cheap seats up on the mezz level. Not as good a view but more comfy."

I've been a couple of times, and these are my hints. Arrive at about 12.30pm. Use the morning to visit the Tokyo Edo Museum (the spectacular building right next door). When you arrive at the stadium, before you go in, spend a little time on the footpath out the front of the stadium to the right. This is the route that many of the Sumo wrestlers take to walk to the stadium from their sumo stables. You will probably see sumo groupies on the footpath, and if you do, join them! You can certainly ask to have your photo taken with some of the less \"important\" sumo wrestlers. (You can tell the important ones by the young sumos following them, carrying their gear. The really important ones have two young sumos to attend to them.) The fans on the street will shout out encouragement to their favourites as they walk past or as they arrive in their cars, and they create quite an atmosphere. After about half an hour go into the stadium and find your seat. In the entrance foyer of the stadium is a brochure stand with excellent brochures in English talking about the stadium and sumo and its history, customs and rules. Take them to read. After you've found your seat, if you haven't eaten, buy a bento box from one of the stands. They sell out quickly. Then go back out to the sumo entrance, inside the stadium grounds. From about 1.30 the big sumo stars start to arrive, and it's fun to watch the fans get very excited, as well as to see how truly \"big\" these stars are close-up. Get back to your seat by around 2pm, because the first procession of competitors happens between 2 and 2.30. Then enjoy the bouts. As the afternoon progresses so does the level of competition. The most important bouts are right at the end. After you've seen a couple of early bouts, go and have a look at the sumo museum, in the stadium. After the final bout of the day, when everyone else starts to leave, stay so that you can watch the traditional bow dance. If you're lucky enough to be there on the last day of the tournament, stay for the prize giving ceremony - the trophies are so big, you'd have to be a sumo to lift them!When you buy seats, remember that some of the best seats in the house are the worst for foreigners. The seats on the ground floor of the stadium, including the box seats, are simply flat cushions on the floor, with no room to spread out. You have to be capable of sitting cross-legged or folding your legs under you for hours if you have these seats. We got a box the first time we went, and we spent a lot of time standing at the back, in the aisle. Second floor seats are regular chairs.We bought our tickets before we left for Japan at www.buysumotickets.com. They were helpful via email with seat choices and the tickets came within a fortnight. They charge a small commission, but it's worth it to know that you've got a seat. The tournament we attended was sold out weeks in advance.The sumo tournament is a sporting event filled with customs and ceremonies that are hundreds of years old. It is definitely a cultural experience, as well as a sporting event. There's nothing quite like it - the extraordinary physiques of the competitors, the costumes of the officials, the arena, the attendants, the singing announcements, the posturing and gamesmanship, and so many other things unique to sumo. Don't miss it!"

There are 2 grand sumo tournaments per year. We were lucky enough to be in Tokyo during the autumn one. Getting tickets about halfway through the 20 or so day tournament easy easy. Instead of trying to go early in the morning to get cheaper day tickets (there is a chance that there are none left, plus the interesting fights only start later in the day, so you'd have to trek there twice). So we got regular tickets for a Monday, close to 100 Eur for 2 tickets (we went with a 10 months old baby [who was not perturbed by the fighting at all], who got in for free).It's an amazing experience, even if you don't understand much about sumo. It's just great to see the rituals, people rooting for their favorite starts, and lots of salt tossing and belly slapping. Really not to be missed.

Although sumo is not all year (much like our football, baseball etc - it has its season), if you are lucky enough to be in Japan during this time, it's definitely something to do. For tickets, go to www.BuySumoTickets.com. They (Jeff) were absolutely amazing and went above and beyond to answer all my questions."

Up there with Capsule hotels, Gesihas and Karaoke as the ultimate Japanese experience!Its not every week though as some think, so plan in advance. Simple search will show you schedule and days of tournament, book in advacne as sell out fast on the dayWe booked seats in area B, which were good view and pretty relaxed, couldn't do the tatami mats, so can't say what they are like, price and discomfort put us off!Early fights aren't much but go about 2ish to see Juryo Ring Entering Ceremony and then the Makuuchi (big boys) later!Also worth staying outside the stadium for abit with the crowds to see the sumos walking in, always good seeing one of the bigger boys like Hakuho or one of the Japanese favourites Check out http://vimeo.com/29776934for short video, without showing too much, great soundtrack as well!"

We purchased the lowest priced tix and still had a great view from the best side of the stadium. It was a great spectacle, and we wished we could have stayed for the evening session, but we had baseball to get to. Our tix did allow for us to stay - they cover your attendance for the whole day....allow a day, if you can...to take in the whole spectacle of the wrestlers arriving at the stadium outside, to the grand stadium entrances, to the amazing displays of one-upmanship and wrestling....all this from a non-sports-fan!"

            "review": "Must See!. If you're in Japan while a tournament is going on, you simply must go. It's a unique, memorable experience. Even if you know very little about sumo, once the matches start you'll be drawn in and you'll end up just as excited as the other spectators around you. The stadium is really easy to find - it can be seen from the JR Ryogoku Station, which is on the Chuo Line. We reserved tickets in the Arena C area ahead of time through BuySumoTickets.com and they delivered them to our hotel in Shibuya so they were there when we arrived. I'm not sure this is always necessary, but we were planning on getting there later in the day instead of early in the morning, so it seemed like a good idea. There were very helpful attendants inside the stadium entrance who helped us find our seats. Our seats were the farthest away from the action that can be reserved in advance, but I could see and hear everything just fine. Try to get a seat on the north or south side of the stadium, as the wrestlers face east and west and this will give you the best view. Your ticket will get you in for a full day - 8 AM to 6 PM. We got there around 3:00,around when the pros started, and found that that was plenty of time. The wrestlers who are the biggest deals go at the end, so just be sure not to miss the later matches."

Well worth the price to see this unique cultural event. Arrived early and stayed late so we saw all levels of Sumo. Enjoyed waiting outside for arrival of participants and they were all very accommodating with pictures. If your trip corresponds with one of the tournaments, make sure you add it to your itinerary. Would do it again in a heartbeat!"

I bought mine from www.japanball.com, and they hand delivered the tickets to me. they charge a $59 premium no matter the number of tickets you buy. it was well worth it. as for sumo, if you like baseball, and have an interest in different cultural endevors, go. it was great fun. got to see the world champion who is mongolian. its great anytime when you see a world's best. go, its good stuff..c"

            "review": "Awesome Practice Session last Apr 29, 2012. While planning for our Tokyo trip, I wanted to witness a Sumo match. Unfortunately, during the time when we were in Tokyo (Apr 27-May1), the season hasn't started yet, but we were lucky that a practice session was held on Apr 29 and it was open for public for free. You can instantly know from the crowd's reactions who are the rikishi favorites during the session. Great experience. Highly recommend watching the actual matches if you are in town. I would, when I come back to Tokyo. :DI saw the prices of the tickets on actual matches, and it would cost a few hundred (and thousand yen for nearer seats). Blogged about my experience here:http://www.tagofabic.com/2012/05/sumo-wrestling-practice-session-in.htmland the official website of Sumo schedules here:http://www.sumo.or.jp/eng/kyokai/event/index.html"

One tournament is 14 days and only 4 tournaments per year. It's really amazing. Sometimes one match is over in a matter of seconds, sometimes it lasts for a couple of minutes. Either way, once the wrestlers are facing each other ready to \"go\" you can't take your eyes away!"

            "review": "Superb Sumo - easy to book yourself. We had an amazing time when we visited The Kokugikan in January 2011 even as none sports fans. We were desperate to see some live sumo action while in Japan and very luckily for us, one of the 6 tournaments taking place in Tokyo each year was in town. We used a website called www.sumo.or.jp - which had easy access information for ticket booking in english. (OK they charged per ticket for processing but who does'nt these days!). You also receive a leaflet containing the history of the art (and more recently sport) which is just fascinating.The site has date of release information and floor plans of all the various venues across the country. The earlier you book, even if taking cheaper tickets, the better the seat. For example we took tier C tickets in Tokyo but were on the front row, paying half what the row in front were, for the same view. If you book via the site you get a confirmation within 3 days which you hand in on arrival. It is also possible to just arrive on the day and pay on the door, though this is less advisable.Inside the stadium are traditional foods, memoribilia and a small museum (though not much in english). But in all honesty you will probably be caught up in the action as soon as you arrive. The ticket gives you entry to the earlier less senior rounds which usually take place late morning, then continuous action until the Yokozuna class in the mid afternoon, finishing around 6pm ish. Dont miss the start of each session when all fighters arrive in the ring together, great for photos! Thoroughly worth it, cannot recommend it highly enough, enjoy!"

            "review": "Worth a visit, wish it was more comprehensive!. The Sumo Museum is a bit tricky to get to from the subway. It's nestled behind the Edo-Tokyo Museum in the front of the Kokugikan building where the matches are held. Once inside the gates you can't miss it, just look for the wall painted with big Sumo wrestlers. The museum itself is free to enter and you are given a complimentary booklet describing the history of the sport. There is adequate (and sometimes charming) English signage but most of the descriptions are obviously in Japanese. There is a wall of past Grand Champions and numerous other artifacts. To the left of the museum as you face the arena is a store selling the requisite momentos. There are only three tournaments a year held here so unless you come during those times there won't be a match to watch.My only problem with the museum was that it was so small! Being that Sumo wrestling is one of the 3 or 4 things most people can even superfically relate to Japan, I was hoping for a more extensive, intereactive experience. How about having real wrestlers there showing their moves or a life size ring and talks on Sumo history, etc. ? You can easily do a comprehensive visit here in 45 minutes.Dont' get me wrong, it's still worth the trip but I just wish there was more to it; still recommended especially for those already going to the Edo-Tokyo museum."
