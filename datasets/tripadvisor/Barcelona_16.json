If its a good day you can go up the stairs to see the views of the city. But luckily it was raining and my husband declined. Not though that it costs more money if you wish to go up onto the roof.

In fact one day is not enough to explore this place. Getting at the top is like being in heaven or as close to heaven as you can. There is something about the place that will make you want to go back. It was busy and quite hot when we were there but I would rather it hot than raining. It is like a place above the clouds which is truly amazing. The train ride from Placa de Espanya is one hour so it's always best to leave as early as you can. But it was worth it. I will definitely go back again."

Once having read-up about it beforehand and the second time I went on a guided tour which was so much better. There is a great deal of interesting history contained in this building, but it is no immediately evident just by looking at it. Going with a guide really unlocked for me lots of detail about the origins of the church, what was on the site previously, about how the church was built, quirks of the building, its materials and the windows, how the building has survived the various invasions and wars that have hit Barcelona and how the church functioned (functions still) within its community."

Another example of stunning Catalan Gothic architecture - after entering the church (via main doors!) people are just standing, struck by the great interior, monumental and shadowy, with the gigantic cross in front of them. It makes a huge impression, makes you feel like you are in different world - it's so different from the noisy streets outside. It's a calming, soothing, almost religious experience just to walk around this church an explore the details of splendid Gothic architecture."

The stained glass windows are still lovely even in the dusk light. It is a cavernous space with various dedications around the walls - worth wondering around, absorbing the atmosphere as you go along, and then sitting down to look at the nave, making the most of the peace. Lovely square outside to have a drink."

The architecture and stained glass windows are gorgeous and inspiring.

Do not forget to walk behind the cathedral to the cloister and visit the interior gardens and a pretty fountain in the center of the building."

The height gives it the feel of somewhere much larger and grander but it is actually quite small. The stained glass windows are breath-taking, and the statues in each of the alcoves all tell their own story. Take time to sit for a while and take in the atmosphere. I did a 'circuit' of the Basilica then sat and read the leaflet, then went round again! I personally am not keen on taking photo's in places of worship so I was more than happy to buy postcards in the tiny shop.Compared to some 'tourist' attractions this was quiet and not overcrowded. Will definitely visit again next time I am in Barcelona."

It is a lovely, lofty space and really send the tingles down your spine, especially if the organ is being played as it was on our visit.The church was badly damaged by fire during the Spanish Civil war, which means all the Baroque interior was destroyed, leaving the original Gothic interior exposed. As we are not great fans of heavy Baroque interiors this for us is a massive advantage, as the church is a fine example of the clean gothic style and the decoration in the side chapels is, in the main, pleasingly modern and simple. There is some beautiful carvings, statues and stained glass from across the centuries.You can visit the church for free in the mornings (when the light is great) and later in the day (after 5pm), but it really is worth taking one of their guided cultural tours during the afternoon - cost us 8 Euros each in 2016. It includes a visit to the roof tops, crypt and choir space, but more importantly the details of why and how the church was built and how it fitted into the environment of 14th century Barcelona. The guides are extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and offer tours in various languages."

The soaring ceilings and Gothic architecure are amazing, and to think this was built in the 1300s! Be sure to check out the stained glass windows, they are brilliant. Recommend going either in the morning or late(r) afternoon to avoid crowds and have some quiet time in the church. Otherwise, unfortunately there are too many tourists. But even if crowded, go, because it is not to be missed."

This is one of the oldest churches in the area, and it's size and scale is incredibly impressive for how they would have built it in that era.Items to note:- There have been periods of time where the church experienced significant damage, including an 11 day long fire. So some original facets of the church and decor are not from the original time period.- The church has periods of time where it closes and forces a fee to enter. If you go in the morning or after 5:00pm, then you can avoid the fee and experience the church for free."

The stained glass windows which date back to the 15th to 18th centuries all survived the Spanish Civil War.It's considered to be the most impressive example of Catalan Gothic church architecture. Inside, the soaring cathedral ceilings aren't as covered with decoration, which was the intent.We also were surprised to see a copy of the Black Virgin of Montserrat statue in one of the small side chapels. Impressive. And worth a 15-30 minute stop."

We walked up the really narrow walkway and it was pretty cool. The church is old and built in the original Catalan style, versus the mixed Gothic/Catalan style of the larger cathedral!

We visited during the afternoon at a time when a payment of 5 euros was required for entry - we paid an extra 3 euros for a guided tour and this was well worth the money. The tour was interesting and included a rooftop walk that provided excellent views across Barcelona. This is a light, airy church and well worth visiting."

As we were dressed for the 35 degree heat we thought we would have to do the same which didn't appeal to be honest. Im so glad we decided to explore as it is beautiful inside.

Headed back from the beach to the hotel through the small backstreets and came across the Basiica. It was not on our agenda for the day. Entered the basilica and felt an instant feeling of peace and serenity. Have visited many basilicas, churches etc but this little gem beats them all! What struck me the most I guess was the beauty of the inside but also the outside, the connection which the basilica had to the city. The old town hugs the basilica in its' arms. Close to the heart."

On Sunday mornings there's limited access because of Mass, but on the front steps a band sets up and people hold hands to form a big circle and dance in the square. There's also a nice open air antique market. Behind the church is the best part of the church, in my opinion, where you'll find several small chapels and a pretty shady garden with tall palm trees and The Well of Geese. Since the Middle Ages geese have guarded the grounds. It's all free and makes for a memorable morning."

There was even a window with a recent year in it. The guide later told us that this was the result of the Republicans burning this church for ten days straight during the civil war. Parts of the building still show signs of fire damage.If you buy a ticket for the tour, you get to go up the tower as well.

The cathedral itself is free to go into, and I recommend taking a look around if mass isn't going on.We paid to go on the rooftop tour. I recommend it. You have to go up some spiral staircases, which seems to be common in cathedrals. But you get to go out on the roof and look over the city of Barcelona. The roof is higher than the general cityscape around it so you can see for quite awhile and take some great pictures. You have to be prepared to do a little bit of climbing/high stepping at places on the roof, as it wasn't really intended for people to just be walking around and hanging out.They have lots of stained glass windows, including one for FC Barcelona. You can't escape it in that town. I don't think our tour guide was a big futbol fan."

This marvellous book will tell their story and therefore the story of the church."

Hard to say why, but it is so imposing and old and still in use. Many alcoves with various saints, priests buried underfoot, imposing organ that is played during Mass...Also it is free. Other churches were not and just don't agree with that. We stayed for mass in spanish, even though we did not understand most of it, what is great about Catholic services is that they are all the same formula so you get the gist. Great priest, animated and youngish. Light a candle and pray in the side chapel which is stunning behind the altar. Mass is in the small chapel during the week. Noon on Saturdays (or Sundays?) is the English international mass. Evening mass followed by a great dinner in the El Born area is highly recommended. Also do be respectful and don't set your camera noisily clicking panoramic photos over and over, or walk in in your bathing suit and a cover up, or have your small children running around, or sit and use the prayer pews as a hangout for teenagers. This is just so rude."

There is a lack of information inside the church however it is a beautiful church and also has a nice garden with geese (living in not so clean conditions). The view from the roof is nice, they are currently restoring the roof so there isn't too much space up there but worth the lift ride to the top."

Its architecture is fairly bare and devoid of interesting details both inside and out. The interior space is large and impressive and the rose window is nice, but neither are spectacular. The interior is bare stone, dimly lit and with very little light coming in though the small stained glass windows. You will see no frescoes or no detailed gothic sculpture. Very bare and minimalistic, which, to be fair, can be impressive in a way. Overall the church is an OK attraction for a 10 minute visit, but will not be a mind shattering experience for anyone."

The view is impressive, especially once the guide tells you what the coast would have looked like when the church was first built and what role the church played. We love history and churches in particular for the role they played in European development, and this one did not disappoint. The rose and its history was also fascinating. Don't miss the guild crypts in the floor!"

The guide who took uS was very passionate about their history which made the tour even better. We got to go up the bell tower and then out onto a section of the rooftop. The view was fantastic. Here you could see a panaromic view of Barcelona. We stood outside of the rose window whilst the guide told us the history of this place. Don't be put off by the stairs, it's well worth the effort!"

Impressive glass work, exceptional columns, filled with architectural details and an overall mystic experience. Well worth a visit for a Mass, some individual prayer, or just for walking through it and admiring it from top to bottom and from side to side, inside and out. Definitely worth checking out its history before going for a full understanding of its magical beauty. The most romantic couples know to get married there. Just captivating."

Was lucky to be able to join a recently started tour to the top led by an english speaking guide who did an amazing job of explaining the architecture (gothic), the surroundings of the cathedral (there are 4 gothic cathedrals in this area which is an amazing #-due to Barcelona's high standing at that time in history. He explained how the Rose window had to be replaced in the 15th century (versus the 14th century original construction) and showed us the ventilation pipes and how they are protected from the rain, as well as providing interesting historical context that made our visit that much more interesting. After the tour, I was able to tour the cathedral itself which is also just breathtakingly beautiful, and as one who has read the fictional novel-Santa Maria del Mar-it was fun to speak with the guide about how that book described life and culture at the time the cathedral was being built. This is a must see plus touring the small boutiques and restaurants that abound around the cathedral makes for time that is fun and satifyingly spent."

There are people begging for money outside the cathedral..certainly not violent people who will accost u, but just older folks who've had a clearly tough lot in life. I highly recommended activity seeing this cathedral..the area is beautiful too to just sit outside on its steps or enjoy a drink from a cafe across the street. Also, there are certain times during which people are allowed in, so make sure you look at that prior to your visit. When I went (around 12:15) they weren't letting people in until 1.

Likely the largest are the Cathedral, which was used largely by the nobility and the Basilica of Santa Maria del Mar (St. Mary of the Sea), which was built by merchants. Santa Maria del Mar is easy to find and if you are simply exploring the Barri Gotic or returning from the beach area, you may simply stumble across it as we did.The structure is enormous and packed with religious statues and imagery, including approximately a dozen ornate chapels around the perimeter. Also note the painted bosses on the ceiling.You will find a number of surprising details. On the darker side, there are some graves on the floor simply with a skull, apparently marking victims of the plague, which wiped out something like 60% of Barcelona's population. Please note the Madonna and child statue in the apse with a ship in front as it is \"St. Mary of the Sea\" and its patrons relied on the sea trade for their livings.This is a beautiful structure and all the more amazing considering that it was built with technology from centuries ago."

It was so worth it to have the church almost to ourselves for the hour before the free entry. There were very few people in the huge space and it was so quiet it was a pleasure to look at every little chapel and read the brochure that described the statues and stained glass windows.

A Roman-Christian necropolis was revealed by the excavations carried out in 1960-61 under the church.We establish that the work should have belong to parishioners, only hardware officials temple; the rule is all the more remarkable that it is even applied. It seems that everyone in the Ribera actively participated in the construction; a fundamental contribution was made by longshoremen ( \"bastaixos\") from the port of La Ribera, who transported the stone blocks, one by one, the Montju\u00efc quarry or beach where the boats unloaded to the site of the 'church.The cathedral of La Seu, the official cathedral represented the monarchy, authority, wealth, high clergy. The church Santa Maria del Mar was in turn to be the symbol of humility and faith of the fishermen who were building.Around 1350 the walls, the side chapels and the facade were completed. In 1379, about to complete the arch of the fourth bay, scaffolding caught fire and the stones were seriously damaged. Finally, the last cornerstone was placed November 3, 1383 and the day of the feast of the Assumption of the following year (15 August 1384) was celebrated the inaugural mass.In 1428 an earthquake caused the collapse of the rosette. A new rose window in Gothic style, was completed in the year 1459 and laying vitraux1 completed the following year.The baroque altar and most of the ornaments and imagery added over the centuries were burned by the fire of 19 to 20 July 1936, during the Spanish civil war.The church [edit | modify the code]The church is open to visitors from Monday to Sunday, from 9 am to 13 h 30 and 16 h 30 to 20 hours.Exterior [change | modify the code]Exterior The building has a solid and robust appearance, which does not reflect what you will find inside. The dominance of horizontal lines and walls without large openings nor decorations is total. the visual impression was of a compact block, without the skirts of different depths typical of European Gothic walls.The main fa\u00e7ade is punctuated by two octagonal towers (the same form that have columns inside) and two powerful buttresses around the rose and give the feeling of the magnitude of the inner vault. two horizontal sections is observed, clearly marked by moldings, whereas in the towers horizontality is emphasized by galleries. The lower part is centered on the portal, while in the top of the rose was at his side two large windows placed between the buttresses and towers.The austerity feeling is even seen in the side walls, walls without decorations that fill the space between the buttresses (allowing the presence of the interior chapels). The design is quite different from that of French Gothic slender, with a complete lack here of flying buttresses. Horizontally, clearly we see three floors. The lower level corresponds to the side chapels, with narrow windows, one for each chapel, three windows between the buttresses.Two doors open on the sides, the door Sombrerers and that of the Moreres. A door was then opened in the apse, the door of the Born.Interior [change | modify the code]The interior has three naves with ambulatory and without cross. Although we are in the presence of three naves, it seems that the architect had wanted to experience the same feeling of space we would have with a single nave. To give this impression, he departed the pillars (15 meters away) and limited the height difference between the naves (the height of the aisles is 7 / 8ths of the nave).The nave is lit by oculi open between the galleries and the central aisle. These oculi become windows between the columns of the presbytery, which almost entirely occupy the space available and help strengthen the effect of columns with a light semicircle. The aisles receive light windows (one per span), not too large, which contribute to the lighting of the nave."

So that was nice. And the towers are cool to see up close, of course.Since the fee goes to a good cause, I recommend paying it, even if you've been to Santa Maria del Pi, which has a great view from its tower, too. The views from each Basilica are different. I recommend seeing both. And the inside of Santa Maria del Mar is gorgeous."

We turned up just in time for an English speaking tour of the building, which was really interesting and engaging, giving us a good sense of the history of the city as well as the church (plus we got to go up onto the room and get a spectacular view on the city). Well worth visiting if you're in the area!"

The construction of this building lasted from 1329 to 1383. The church is a bit \u201csqueezed\u201d in the narrow streets and it is not easy to perceive its harmonious, clean-lined and geometrically perfect design. The interior of the church is stunningly bright and the central space is supported by slender, octagonal columns with no architectural boundaries between its three aisles."

Do take the lift to the rooftop, where you get a great view of the city and can see the spires and bell towers close up. Be warned though if you are not good with heights the walkways are scaffolding platforms, and not for the faint hearted. At 2euros each its also much cheaper than the Sagrada Familia, which you can see in the distance. There is also an unusual crypt that looks like a theatre, with steps going down to it in the middle of the church. And lastly the beautiful cloister, complete with fountain, pond, geese and palm trees, unexpected and quite magical."

If you want to enjoy the atmosphere of a mediaeval cathedral without the distraction of too much baroque tat, then this is the place for you. I do not think it will disappoint. It is truly a Cathedral of and for the people. Largely funded by craftsmen, fishermen and their guilds in the Middle Ages, before wealthier patrons put their hands into their coffers it is still a living church for real people. Incidentally, many of the stonemasons and other craftsmen dedicated their scarce free time to the building of this special Cathedral."

Catalan Gothic is not made of concrete or cement, but of stones put together like bricks. It is the result of the work of the people of historic Barcelona, the men who carried the stones from the sea. It is also one of the privileged places for chamber music and chorals, as its acoustic is superb. You can visit the cathedral and the Sagrada Familia, but most of all, don't forget to visit Santa Maria del Mar. It is the most beloved architectural treasure for Barcelona's people."

After reading the novel \"Cathedral by the Sea\" I planned our trip to Barcelona to begin with this church visit and end with a visit (tickets purchased beforehand on Internet to avoid the long lines) of the Sagrada Familia. We were not disappointed in our choice to start our stay in this fascinating city! The entire El Born area is filled with interesting winding and narrow streets, shops, cafes and restaurants. We spent about four hours simply wondering in the area. The history of the construction of the church in only 60 years provided a pure Catalan style. Knowing the background of the local workers and wealthy shipping investors made the visit so much more interesting. Also interesting is the still evident effects on the ceiling from damage during the Spanish Civil War.If you enjoy history and learning about Catalan identity, this church should not be missed. Reading the novel helps greatly in setting history to the place."

The rebuilding has returned the Church to its stark, Gothic style.Construction of the Church is symmetrical, with each side altar being 10 feet deep, each side aisle double that, and the central aisle four times as wide. The interior is very stark, but make sure you also visit at night, when the interior takes on a completely different aura. Entry is free from 5.30 until 8.00pm.Make time to visit this Basilica, in addition to the Barcelona Cathedral, a nearby 15 minute walk."

Incredible, glorious, awe-inspiring--these are only a few of the adjectives I could use to describe this magnificent gothic cathedral. Not to detract from the genius of Gaudi, this structure is what comes to my mind when I think of the word \"cathedral.\" I just did a walk-through on my own, rather than taking a tour, because we were on our way to something else when we stopped here. I wish I had taken a tour because the structure has such an interesting history (which I learned after the fact), and there were many features of this magnificent church that I overlooked. There are some informational displays in the back of the church providing facts related to its construction. They're not in English, alas, but you can figure out the basics. I took photos of the information so I could try to do some translating when I got home. Anyway, the columns soar to an incredible height, and in doing so, while you know you're surrounded by stone, you also get the feeling of openness. As a side note, when you've had enough of the glorious architecture, you can walk back outside and possibly be entertained by assorted street performers. When we left the church, we encountered a lively group of acrobat-type performers from South America. There's no doubt that Barcelona is a city of contrasts!"

We have visited Barcelona several times, always staying in Borne, close to Santa Maria del Mar so it has become a familiar place. We also visited the cathedral and the contrast is stark. The basilica is high, wide and relatively uncluttered so you can feel the space around you. Every side chapel at the cathedral is decorated, almost excessively but the basilica relies upon its stonemasons for both its grandure and its decoration. I am anti-religon but Santa Maria del Mar is a lovely place to sit and contemplate while one's spirits recover from the rush of the day.There are various formal tours and it is possible to visit the roof but so far I have not tried any of those."

There were street performers. Groups. People sitting on the steps playing a guitar. It is located in Old town with marvelous winding street. You can have perfume made just for you. When I went, an opera singer was singing in back of church and the sound echoed off the old walls. Located right off bus stops. Easy access to other parts of city. This hotel and the Sagrada Familia are the two churches to visit. In the vicinity is Hotel Colon (across from church) and Oola about 2 blocks. Located within walking distance of Palacio de Musica which is another marvel. I was not lucky enough to be there for a performance."

Some tourists were balking at paying an entrance fee although I consider \u20ac8 for the entrance - which also included a guided roof tour \u2013 very reasonable. Pol, the guide on the roof, was an entertaining and informative guide who pointed out the views, the history of the surrounding streets and buildings as well as giving us a detailed explanation of the church, its architecture and the bells. What impressed me was the centrally illuminated stone spiral staircase which led to the roof. The church itself has a remarkable cohesion architecturally but its outstanding feature in the forest of columns in the apse \u2013 a brilliant piece of design and engineering in stone. It is possible to climb another spiral staircase behind the apse to view the church from the triforium. A special treat which many English cathedrals could adopt. Situated so close to the Born Cultural Centre, you should not miss this outstanding building. Whilst Pol was a gem of a guide on the roof it was the welcome from Pedro on the door who also made visiting worthwhile especially as he spoke with warmth and a great depth of knowledge displaying his evident love of the church. That fact that his English was so good was a bonus. Unmissable\u2026N.B. The excellent leaflet that you get on entry has a plan so as not to miss any of the features. However it states that the basilica is \u201c80 meters (or 100 feet) long\u201d. Don\u2019t undersell the building\u2026 80 metres is just over 262 feet which emphasises its cathedral-esque proportions!"

Hemmed in amidst the bustle and hubbub of Barcelona's Ribera district sits the imposing 14th Century Basilica of Santa Maria del Mar. The Basilica is huge and in marked contrast to the narrow, busy streets outside, and and dates from a time when Barcelona was a very rich maritime power. It is built in the gothic style, with tall pillars supporting vaulted ceilings.There are some very beautiful stained glass windows, and one gets a feeling of great space when inside. From an entirely secular point of view I enjoyed my visit despite the lack of internal decoration such as tapestries and paintings.A word to the wise, many reviewers have stated that the Basilica is free to enter; that is true but only partially. On the day I visited I parted with \u20ac5 to get in. Only after I left did I learn that had I waited 15 minutes until 5PM, the visit would be free. Time your visit accordingly. "

Despite the vivacity of the bars and restaurants on the plaza outside the west doors, inside the church is a haven of quiet, peopled by tourists and by pilgrims and worshippers. The space is vast. Take a seat on one of the pews near the west doors, and let the height and distance take you in. Then walk around, light a candle, say a prayer, and be grateful for such a gorgeous ancient church in the middle of this bustling and wonderful city."

Initially we visited one afternoon and paid the admission charge. From my observation most tourists visit outside these dedicated hours and don't pay the charge because they come when it's open for worship. I was happy to pay the fee but to ensure the admission charge is paid all the other doors are closed which made the Basilica very warm. It is less grand than the Cathedral but lovelier.

Hilariously, we walked around the basilica a couple of times and we were like wheres the way in??? not realising the actual opening time is 5pm! We got back to the front of the basilica where there were people hovering around and boom the door opened, and there was a massive gush of people inwards.I do like the fact that it is free admission. You don't get a lot of places in BCN that is free. Considering its such a large monument - I was expecting to pay a fee to enter.The basilica is stunning. I'm glad I visited. I'm not a big fan of churches but I still enjoyed the visit. I just like the size of it and you get to see the architecture etc. For the people who don't like churches - its just another church but you should visit this anyway..."

It is a historical novel, but the main story is based in real facts. If you are thinking of visiting Barcelona, and of course you have time, I highly recommend reading this novel and The shadow of the wind by Carlos Ru\u00edz Zaf\u00f3n. Both of these books will give you an idea of what Barcelona and the Barcelonians are. Of course, have in mind that this idea will be just a slightly tiny introduction, but it is better than nothing.Santa Maria del Mar is a must in Barcelona! See it during the day and at night. Sometimes there are concerts in it. If so, buy tickets and go. The acoustic is perfect and the ambiance magical!;-) Enjoy!"

While the main one is European gothic, Santa Maria del Mar is an example of the rare so-called Mediterranean gothic, which embraces simplicity and plays with heights and levels in order to provide a luminous effect. This is a must-see in the city for those who like architecture, and for those who like medieval heritage. Go and see both, compare their styles, understand their different paths to represent divinity. Its duality may very well symbolize two simultaneous currents of thought in a time of darkness.

I went in a sleeveless top and had to buy a scarf to cover my arms / shoulders, so ladies don't forget something to cover yourself. Also in the square on the day we visited was an old man playing a trumpet alongside a younger man playing a piano, they were brilliant. After we visited the cathedral we wanted to go back to Port Vell for food and there were a few rickshaws waiting for hire, we paid 10 Euros and had a brilliant trip through the narrow streets of Barri Goti down to the port. Highly recommend"

Arguably, it deserves a higher profile - but that might detract from what makes it such a special place, if it became as busy as La Catedral. Further, admission is free, whatever time you visit. The outside gives little idea of the scale of what the interior is like. Hopefully, when you visit you will have time to sit down and experience the atmosphere of this place; after all, it is a functioning church, not a tourist attraction. While here, locate El Fossar de les Moreres, the monument with the eternal flame, just nearby."

However, when we stepped into this old church, it was jaw dropping. We all said it was absolutely magnificent. It is a true definition of an old basilica church. It is authentic and a true representation of an ancient Spanish Church. We felt la Sagrada Familia was tourist museum even though its was an actual church, and compared to this church not authentic feeling. The Santa maria del Mar church did not have a million tourists inside and services were being held and the reverance required inside a holy place was in place. The architecture is amazingly beautiful. This was a DO NOT MISS in my book. Its in a side street and was a little difficult to locate, but so very worth the wait. We used the hop on hope off touristic bus to get there and also to visit the magic fountain that evening. Best day spent in Barcelona, truly magical."

After a pause in the shade of the church you can wander through the little streets of the Gothic Quarter towards the Picasso museum."

It is 5 euro to visit, whereas some books say it is free but it is a beautiful sacred space with a rich heritage and a clearly expressed desire to be a church and place of worship which serves its neighbourhood. Staff were welcoming and it was quiet enough to allow reflection but busy enough to not feel conspicuous. Unlike some tourist churches, you are always aware that this is a place of worship and a house of prayer - a definite must see if you are in the Born quart or the old town."

With its trim Gothic lines and bare stone walls, Santa Mar\u00eda del Mar is a beautiful church that prompts introspection and reflection precisely because of its simplicity. The austerity of its interior I find is much more beautiful and impressive than that of its ornate and baroque counterparts. Located in the Born quarter of the old city, it presides solemnly over the surrounding maze of narrow streets, near the sea. The protagonist of \"La catedral del mar,\" it is no wonder it has inspired many such works of literature."

Make sure you meet the entry requirements- there's a sign outside outlining their dress requirements. It's nothing drastic, but they will stop you going in if they feel you're dressed inappropriately.

The primary reason to visit is the discussion of the Catalan Gothic architecture which is based on a horizontal line as opposed to vertical like elsewhere in Europe. It is a very plain church, part of the Catalan style. Still I liked both the Cathedral and Santa Maria de Pi better. The cathedral, ignore the entrance facade add in the 1800s, has the same architecture with more inside and Santa Marie de Pi is almost identical in design but it also has the tour you can climb. With that said I still liked my visit and I enjoyed the Catalan Gothic, I just think there are other churches that deserve a visit and more time including Sagrada Familia. Also there is a great memorial to the Catalans who lost their life in the rebellion just to the south of the church where hundreds were buried."

I had entered at the alter end of the church and was mesmerised by the massive stone columns in front of me which were at the back of the alter, they transported me back to Santuario di Santo Stefano in Bologna, Italy for awhile.Santa Maria del Mar was constructed in the 14th century and only took 55 years to build. The architectural style is Catalan Gothic and it has such beautiful symmetry. The stone columns seem so tall, there is a good amount of natural lighting that shines through the many stain glassed windows. It is a well preserved and peaceful oasis in a busy city."

Our English-speaking tour guide was fabulous -- incredibly knowledgeable not just about the Basilica, but about the city's history and other landmarks. A special treat is that you get to walk up to the exterior roofline of the cathedral to look out over the neighborhood and city, with wonderful views -- just make sure that you are capable of climbing 120 steps before you sign on for the journey. This is not an ornate, ostentatious cathedral, but one that is humble and spiritual; you will be inspired."

This is a beautiful church tucked away from the crowds at the very different and famous Sagrada Familia. I had read the best seller \"Cathedral by the Sea\" 5 years ago, but did not connect the novel to this church for several days.I was fortunate to attend an evening performance of Mozart's \"Requiem Mass \" during the week-end of Palm Sunday. The acoustics were amazing in such a spiritual setting. The Cathedral was full and all were inspired.The blessing of the palms by the Cardinal at the main Cathedral of Barcelona before mid morning Mass on Palm Sunday was very moving when all waved their palms as holy water was showered upon them. Such awe inspiring experiences as a prelude to the processions in the evening."

As I arrived , I texted my uncle, a priest, who has worked in south america and travelled widely; he said if I was near, I should visit his \"favourite church in the whole world\" and told me of the Basilica. I looked at the map and Lo! my eyes fell on it ... it was a few hundred metres from my intended destination and I had never heard of the Basilica before. I arrived at 11.56 and did not expect to find a Mass starting. I found myself in the midst of the front seated congregation and stayed for the Mass. It was joyous, the singing was angelic, the ambience gentle, the translation of the readings into English helpful and the priest coming to shake the hand of every person in the Mass seats was a lovely touch and he even waved to the tourists who chose to remain at the back of the church. I was moved to tears and I thank God for my faith. The church has a lovely acoustic, the ten pillars around the altar coalesce at the ceiling in a vault of Heaven. It is a gothic-esque masterpiece which is small enough to feel cosy but grand enough to elevate the soul.I do not recognise the church or attitude that the earlier reviewer summarised. Maybe her skirt was just not short in the right way, but there were plenty of lovely human beings in that church, lovely in every way, and the beauty of life radiated from everyone. You go to a Mosque or Synagogue you are expected to show respect but people cant have a pop at Muslims or Jews so they keep having a go at Catholics or Christianity in general. fair enough, que sera, sera.You make sure to visit this church if you find yourself within 50 miles of it yet alone 50 metres and you will not be disappointed."

But the chapels are not as ostentatious or opulent as some. Our opinion may have been a lot different if we had made it to the roof but we were too late for the tour and the English tours were only early in the afternoon (while we would be elsewhere) - if only they would run them at other times in the day.Contrary to some of the reviews and photos there is no garden/cloister attached - there is no room for it.

This is definitely a place to take your time, relax and marvel at the architecture of 600 years ago.

Local fishermen, artisans and workers build this church by themselves because there was no money to let a contractor (or however they called them back then) build it. They got all the stones of from Montjuic, mined and carried by hand, piece by piece, whilst the women took care of the men.The church is build with naked rock, also on the inside, with only a few murals applied onto the bare rock. This is a true place of worship, barren stones, no pompous statues, gold ornaments... just an altar to look at and to pray on one of the benches. Liked it very much, it's simplicity has done it good!Be sure to visit when you're in Barcelona (El Born)."

Built in the 14C, with additional changes in the 15 & 19C.Because the city built itself around the church, it's very hard to get an idea of scale, until you go inside.(One note: if you go to Port Vell and walk along Barceloneta, the church's dome and the statue dominate the skyline.)The interior space is cavern like. The walls and ceiling are unadorned, no statues or plaster. The columns, the support the roof, are these slender structures. There's a sense of peace and tranquility when you enter the church, which is in a basilica style, so no nave or transepts.The windows are from various periods and the rose window is beautiful.You will notice black soot on the ceiling, some of that is due to candles but some is surely due to the fire on 1936, which destroyed the altar.There's a desk, once you enter that provides information and will sell you a candle (various sizes) that you can place in front of the various chapels that border the space.

You will need about 40 min to see the church and there is no charge to enter. Also between Picasso and the church is where we found the best gift shops and we walked all over Barcelona so we saw a lot. Next to the church are some amazing little cafe where you can eat for two and have a craft of wind for about $30 U.S. Dollars."

It doesn't have the overbearing 'bleeding cherubs' that you see in some Spanish churches and there's a dignity about it that is very appealing."

It was built entirely through donations -of money, materials and workforce- in record time for a church of that size, a mere 50 years. Because of that swiftness, it boosts the same Catalan Gothic style from foundation to spires. Catalan Gothic is more austere than its European counterparts, providing a roomy, minimalistic and welcoming interior, unobstructed of ornaments; statues of saints and Virgin Marys are niched in the side chapels. (The only discordant note is the Eucharist chapel, an adjacent baroque aberration, thankfully is only seeable if you walk in).When you do go to Barcelona, do yourself a favour and read Ildefonso Falcones' book \"The Cathedral of the Sea\". Not only it revolves around the building of this Church, but many of the places it mentions are still there today. TIP: go in the morning or after 5 pm to avoid entrance fees."

This lovely 14th century basilica was built with funds donated by the wealthy residents of La Ribera many of whom made their fortunes from shipbuilding or fishing. The Civil War led to the destruction of the ornate and richly historic interior decorations due to fire but the incredible interior shell is still a gothic masterpiece. We toured on our own and we enjoyed the beauty of this place as well as the sense of history and community one can still experience as this is also a local church serving the local community. When you wander out of the church do take some time to stroll the community, perhaps stopping at one of the many cafes or tapas bars along the way. All this and no admission fee!"

The tour allows one to take the stairs up to the roof and get a birds eye view of much of Barcelona in this area. Let me give a big shout out to Martha, our tour guide getting her Ph.D in history at Barcelona University, she was amazing!

We did respect the couple who were being married and did not intrude on their ceremony. We did manage to view the side chapels, of which there are 34, and get a long view of the main altar. All were unique and I recommend taking the time to look at each.After our visit, we chose to eat in one of the little outdoor cafes in the courtyard. While enjoying our meal, the happy newly weds exited the church, had pictures taken with friends and family and seemed to delight in the festive atmosphere.

I am glad that I did, I really enjoyed taking in the architecture, stained glass and also getting a closer look at the geese that live in a small square which is attached to the cathedral. There is also a little museum and you can also access the roof for some great photos.I paid \u20ac6 euros to enter and access all areas including the roof. I would recommend this rather than enter during the times of day when visiting is free - there are more crowds and you have to pay for access to additional areas."

So can't comment on the inside, wish I could say it exemplified a faith that was accessible to all but I think that must only be in the plainer churches. The Barcelona authorities really need to sort out the thieves in this area."

Anyway, on a pre-dinner stroll we decided to pop in because there seemed to be a lot going on. In the Sanctuary there was an entire orchestra setting up. I'm talking at least 75 musicians. Being a lover of most live music I asked and was told it was a Dutch youth orchestra. Now, the thought of a youth orchestra didn't excite me too much....you know how the flute section is never quite in tune and the tubas come in late for their part.....but WOW! the conductor faced the pews and said \"rehearsal\" to make it clear what was happening. When the music began everyone was transfixed by it. For anyone reading this who has not heard a live orchestra in a church, the acoustics are terrific. The point of my review is simply to say if you are in the area find out what events are planned for the cathedral and don't miss them!"

Barcelona is an expensive city for tourist, so before I took my last day in Barcelona, I searched for articles like \"Best free/cheap things to do in Barcelona\". The articles returned by google were not too old (like in late 2012, 2013), and this place is rated as one of the recommended, with favorable comments. Not a big one; but viewed from the small \"plaza\" in front of it, it's quite OK. To my surprise, when I get in, there were a ticket desk there. And the price: 8 EUR/person. Couldn't believe it! The staff there said that it will be free after 5pm, but I could not wait, and rather not to wait, as I had a glance to the interior. It's dark, and not a special church. Rather overrated IMO, I've seen quite a lot of churches better than this.Near the Metro Jaume I, nearby the Museum of Picasso, so you can make a combination. Anyway check the timetable and the information about its free entrance before going. If you cannot find a suitable time slot for it, you don't have to make a special visit.After visiting this one (10 minutes), and didn't pay to get inside, we strolled to the monument of Colombo, which is a more interesting activity."

I find that great architecture brings its own beauty and comfort and so it is here. The church is very near the Picasso Museum so on your way there or back do stop in."

It's not terribly ornate, but it had a certain charm about it that Barcelona's other Gothic churches lack. The Baroque sacristy in the back is gorgeous and is an interesting contrast to the Gothic style of the main building."

The other churches we saw took hundreds of years and the Familiaria is still not finished! A must see."

Considering that we have visited some exquisite churches from Italy to France, we wanted to see St. Mary of the Sea. We headed out on the \"Hop On-Hop Off\" bus (which I highly recommend), and after a good number of side excursions, we arrived at the location of St. Mary's church ... or at least we thought we had. It seems that St Mary's is down several side streets and is not readily visible from the main streets. And so ... we walked and walked, looking for signs and after 20 minutes or so we asked directions from some people on the street. Unfortunately, they weren't sure at all and so we were about to give up and head back to our bus pick-up location. Fortunately, I heard a small group standing nearby mention St Mary's and they seemed to know where they were going ... and so we followed. Through back streets, turning and turning until I was convinced we were following a lost group. Somehow, we made it to the chuch, which happened to be fairly close to our original dropoff point! Here, on a small street, there were quite a few people standing in front of the church and the doors were locked. While nobody seemed to be standing in line, we waited about 20 minutes in the afternoon sun. We walked around to the side ... locked doors. Around to the back ... locked doors. All of a sudden the back door opened and out walks a man who we ask if we can enter. We are told yes and make a dash for the door. It seems the cathedral was just opening doors for afternoon services and our timing was close to perfect.The Cathedral is beautiful and certainly showed it's age. Much like Saint Germain in Paris and Saint Nicholas in Monaco, it is beautifully ornate and dark inside, although smaller in size. I'd recommend seeing St Mary's before seeing Sagrada Familia only because the latter is so overwhelming that anything else simpy doesn't compare. Definitely glad we visited, even though we only stayed 30 minutes. It is a smaller church and only has the one main floor. Still, a church to put on your list and visit because of it's amazing history!"

It was built by the community of the time so it took them only 70 years to finish it. You can see that the builders were not experts just looking at the walls, all the more charming. Worth the visit a lot. Then walk to Mercat del Born and have gelato on the way (on a corner, right hand side, forgot the name of the gelateria, but trust me, you'll looove it). May I suggest nocciola."

Whilst in the building you can just sit back and look up at the roof, and the stain glassed windows which are stunning. You are free to walk around, and photos are allowed, expect when services are being conducted.Within the Gottica/Cathedral area of Barcelona so a must see on your trip."

But even with such a big competitor in the same city, it is still a very impressive piece of architecture. And quite frankly it is somehow refreshing compared to the many Gaudi things which capture so much of Barcelona if you visit the city with a guidebook. However there is one thing which it is not and tha is huge. If you want to be stunned and awed, you need to go to Sagrada Familia."

As of May 2013 you can, for 5 EUR, take a tour of the three terraces which allows a completely different perspective on the church: the outside walls, the roof, the tower, the (non-flying) buttresses, as well as great view of the city. The guide is knowledgeable and the stories she told us were quite interesting. Very recommended."

It is a superb early gothic building (14th century), with the widest nave in Europe and a superb stone vaulted roof. Unfortunately it is hemmed in by surrounding buildings and has an awful chapel bolted on at the altar end (in the Placa de Born)The interior gives a huge sense of space and is often used for concerts. Note the characteristic octagonal columns and the tower. Compared to the othe early gothic European churches, this one has not suffered from later embellishments. The front door has two motifs of the men who were employed to carry the stones one by one of their backs from the quarries on Mont Juic, about 2 km away. Think on it!You will appreciate this church more if you read the novel 'Cathedral of the Sea' by Ildefonso Falcones (it cries out to be a movie or a TV series) but it will tell you a lot about the early history of this church. It was once beside the sea, but there is now 200 m of reclaimed land between it and the modern port."

There is a door that leads neatly to the outside where you will find a small pond, curiously looking geese and some green trees. It offers a relaxing and contemplative atmosphere and you will feel more connected within yourself as you are brought back to nature. Inside the cathedral, only electric candles can be lit by inserting coins into the slots. This is a clever way of protecting the building from accidental fire damage. There is also an elevator that enables you to go up the cathedral. The access costs 3 euros and is a nice and cheap way to get a few shots of the Barcelona city."

The stained glass (and there is LOTS of it) is not that intricate or interesting...so once you get past that, it just feels like another cathedral in Europe.

It is also the finest example of Catalan gothic. This is a very different church to say French gothic, it is wide, the spans of the arches second only to Rome and it is sparse, the contents were burned years ago. As a result the pillars rise out of the gloom to then get almost lost again in the glorious heights of the ceiling. Any guide book will detail the history and notable features but this is not why you should go; it is just beautiful, one of the best in Europe."

It remains truly beautiful and though a visit may only take 30 minutes or so, it is well worth it and at the time of my visit it was free.At the same time nip up the narrow street to the north of the building. a Uruguayan runs the cheapest tiny bodega but he has great wines and the place has a charming disorganised buzz with plenty of cheerful locals along with tourists.

(Secret washroom - at the far side of the gated area there is an entry that on the right leads to a single female toilet and to the left two urinals - one of the few places you don't have to pay someone) Go through the open doorway out of the Cloister in to the main area of the church and observe the detail in architecture - and the huge structured arches that support the building. A lift is available to take you to the roof (3 Euros) where you will see panoramic views of the city. Careful where you step as the walkway on the roof is only scaffolding, some places without railing - not for the faint of heart. We revisited on Sunday morning and were entertained by local outdoor orchestra at front steps of church and locals performing a traditional Catalona dance - they will sometimes encourage bystanders to join in. There are benches in the square but come early as they fill up quickly. This site is worth seeing while in Barcelona"

Then the opening hours was stated on the door. I can't remember what time it was closed in the afternoon. It might have been 11am - 2:30pm i think. So we decided to walk around the area, and returned at 4:30pm. It was nice and quiet, though still with a fair bit of visitors. But we enjoyed sitting down and feel the solemnity of the place. The pillars looked similar to the Sagrada Familia, with its high ceilings, making it pretty majestic. There's no entrance fee but you can buy candles to offer to the many alters of Mary in the cathedral.The cathedral looks old and rustic, which differs from the sagrada familia. I would still recommend a visit to this piece of history and it shouldn't take too long (no queues)."

You can see the inspiration from Santa Maria in Sagrada Familia, with the high, arched ceilings and open, airy interior. It was an inspiring and interesting place and made for an interesting contrast with Sagrada Familia. I went here and then went to Barcelona Cathedral, and they are similar but this is nicer inside because of the bright, open space, whereas Barcelona Cathedral is blocked into different areas so you don't feel the impact. (You want to be sure to see the exterior of Barcelona Cathedral, though.) The light fixtures, ceilings, and columns are almost identical, so if you had to choose one, I would recommend this one as it was prettier. Both are free, though, for just wandering around so if you're not \"churched out,\" you can certainly go to both. The surrounding area is also very nice and interesting (El Born) and worth walking around. Visiting this church makes a good day with Barceloneta and lunch on the beach."

This church is simply very special, located in the heart of the most charming neighborhood in old Barcelona, El Borne, and just a short walk from the Picasso Museum. Built in the early 1300s, the church and its spectacular rose window survived the fires of the Spanish civil war. The plaza in front has a near perfect ambiance, a place to read, sip wine and watch, as locals and tourists pass by. Great for couples, families, and those just by themselves."

There was a service underway and even though I'm not religious, it still was a very peaceful place to visit for a short stop. However there is not much to see inside, and also not many good photo angles from outside. And honestly not that much of the outside to photograph, because it has many flat walls and only a small decorated entry way. The main reason the inside is nice is from the high ceilings and Gothic architecture, and stained glass windows. But you dont need to stay long to appreciate it."

Once you go inside though, it's hard not to marvel at the stained glass windows and ceilings. I am not Christian, and this is one of the few churches I've felt truly welcome in. I did read a fiction book of the same name by I. Falcones and it was fun to see it in person and imagine elements of the story playing out in front of me. Also, as a fan of architecture, it's such a pleasure to see a true Gothic building."

The size, structure and feel of this old church was completely different than La Sagrada. We had a wonderful time hanging outside of the church for over an hour at this fabulous wine bar right outside the church (review of that place forthcoming--will need to look up the name again)."

They have a lovely Christmas mass celebration, should you be in Barcelona during the holidays."

I'm not Christian, but we ended up sitting and reflecting on the pews such was the over whelming atmosphere of the place.Thoroughly recommend a visit. One of the best hidden gems in Barcelona."

The cathedral was build by the people of Barcelona as a house of worship and this you can feel when you visit it. You won't find the usual grandeur of other cathedrals, just calm. It is impressive in it's very own way and well worth a visit.Just mind the opening hours: they have a siesta."

I think it is very good to see it if you are already in the area but the it doesn't really distinguish itself massively from other cathedrals. Having said that they do have lots of statues and paintings of Christian related things which look quite nice so if you had spare time it would be worth going out of the way for.It's worth going up to the top in the elevator (costs \u20ac2.50) for a nice view. Also before 12:45 and after 17:15 it is free to go in (except the elevator) otherwise you have to pay, not sure how much as I went when it was free but I think it was around \u20ac6 - \u20ac8."

For all the reasons.The magnificence of the building is amazing, in my opinion, more breathtaking then Sagrada Fam\u00edlia or even Notre Dame in Paris.The architecture of the building is amazing! You feel crushed once you walk in the door. I'm not religious, but i felt that was a sacred place to be.Plus, it's in Gothic, so lots of places to see nearby and, best of all, it's free! Although i would recommend leaving something or lighting some candles to help maintaining the building...After Palau Guell it's my favourite place in BCN.Go, go, go!!!!!"

It is generally quite an austere church, with much less decoration compared to other old and important churches in Spain. Details of its interior were comparatively rundown when we looked around. The church is a large structure with very restricted sightlines at ground level, hemmed in closely by narrow streets. We were interested to see a major church restoration in progress but this church is probably not yet a sight most people would make a special effort to see before other higher priority sights of Barcelona."

In retaliation, the working class took their anger out on this church and burned all the wood furnishings and d\u00e9cor. The church\u2019s tree-like columns inspired Gaudi when he designed La Sagrada Familia Church.

It is now known because of the Carlos Ruiz Zafon\u00b4s book that has been translated to many languages and also because it is a place where less is more. Being a church built by the poor, Sta Maria del Mar is not the typical cathedral full of decoration, golden altars and images, instead it is a nice and quiet place (when not full of tourists) where light enters in a very graceful way.Picturing Santa Maria del Mar is fun and different to other churches because architecture and people become the main thing, the solid rock walls and the peace that they inspire leave more than one visitor just breathless, so faces and corners become very interesting.One big space where you can see it all from the entrance also allow people interested in picturing to have a wide point of view of the whole place."

This area is commonly known as the Born district and is full of littl boutique shops, the picasso museum is located close by also and is definitely worth the visit."

There is Cathedral in Barcelona, the Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia. The term Basilica is sometimes used to donote a big, fancy church like St. Peter's in Rome, Italy, which is not a Catheral, either."

            "review": "Peaceful, restful place. A great gothic church, without being obnoxiously overdone, there is a purity of line and design here that is very pleasing to the eye. The building was done in the 14th century, and the magnificent stained glass was added in the 15th to 18th centuries. I can see why the previous poster chose this as a wedding spot, it would be ideal, particularly because there is no choir in the center, as there is in most large european churches (actually, I heard that there once was a choir, but it was burned during the spanish civil war). I also heard that it's a great place for concerts. For myself, I just visited midday, but found it a lovely spot to rest, relaxing after a long day of sightseeing, just smelling the candles burning. Admissionis free. It's open 9am-1:30pm and 4pm-8 pm."

I got married there in August '06, so of course I love it!Thing is, I loved the place as soon as I saw it's magnificent towers appearing in front of us as we strolled down the street from the direction of Las Ramblas...the huge door and fantastic circular stained glass window add even more grandure and drama to the church.Inside, the isle seems to go on for miles, the huge chandeliers and imposing alter are simply stunning.Get down there on a Saturday and enjoy a church service. The Plaza bustles with life, love and laughter, it really is amazing. If you don't manage down for a wedding service, go anyway and sit outside sipping a cold glass of Vino....bliss!"

This was my favorite cathedral of Barcelona.This Gothic cathedral was beautiful without being overly ornate.Making it beautiful was the stained glass which was stunning.The atmosphere of this cathedral actually made it a very good place to pray or meditate. We actually liked it so much that we visited it daily to meditate."
