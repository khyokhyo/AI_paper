It is also nice as it is a main pick up for many of the bus tours. Enjoy walking around, soak up some sun if you can. Lots of fun and historical statues. Peter Pan was my favorite! Nice little cafe near the street side. We got some coffee and ice cream which was perfect."

There are chairs available to \"rent,\" or bringing a blanket and spending a few hours laying on the grass is a lovely way to enjoy this space.

Parks are best experienced by locals and tourists not always get the chance to experience them, specifically big ones like this, to the full extent. We didn't spend that much time here and I am sure there were a lot to enjoy and see that we missed out on. I guess one can spend a whole day here. It all depends on the purpose of your trip."

What a great 3 hours (you'll need 7 hours total though to do this - customs, travel time which is only 15 min. each way and enough time to get back to the airport and go through security). After lunch we walked over to the Park. It was full of people walking around and there is a great little outdoor coffee spot overlooking flowers, a lake, etc. Just great for people watching. I would have loved more time at the park just to wonder around."

It is a huge expanse of green with huge ancient oak trees and shrubs and little boarders of exotic flowers and palms. The park is so huge that even if there are crowded areas, I am certain you can still find a quite place to sit and have a picnic. Many a time have we walked through the park both in the summer and at winter. Winter for me is the best! It's cold yet the park is alive with wildlife. The squirrels are super friendly and if you just happen to have some monkey nuts in your bag they will come right up to you and take them from your hands. The birds also! You can either walk by the lake and feed the ducks, swans and geese or rent a paddle boat for an hour, well worth it in the summer but be careful of the queue."

Wandering the 350 acres of central London that is Hyde Park it's difficult to believe that Oxford Street, Park Lane and elegant districts like Mayfair are only moments away.When Henry VIII siezed this land from the nearby monks of Westminster it was to extend his hunting opportunities. He wouldn't recognise it now! It's existed in its current layout for close on 200 years and, on a fine day, is a great place to spend time.Chock full of fountains, monuments, open water, this is a place that commemorates so much of contemporary British history. From two world wars through to the life of Princess Diana and the London Bombing, it's all here. There are lovely walks, a fabulous rose garden and places to rest, eat and drink.You can scrape along the perimeter in an hour but to do the 350 acres justice you need at least half a day."

In the right season i recommend popping in to see the rose garden, the colours are amazing. Also if you plan well there are various events that take place in the park, concerts etc. My only concern was in some parts of the park the toilets were in bad condition (considering you pay 50p) and in one case the mens was closed."

Now I know why people like living in London, We were in Hyde Park on the Sunday morning taking the long way around to the Festival in a Day (Radio 2) and saw people walking dogs of all shapes and sizes, runners, walkers, roller skaters, exercising, people talking on benches or in groups. Planes flew overhead every 5 mins or so heading for Heathrow and the sun was out, shining and hot for September. We were heading for the Princess Diana memorial and although my back was hurting and I was a little hungover from the Proms (the previous day), this is worth visiting.It is a well designed piece of art, where people can paddle about a bit and almost seems to defy gravity when you look at it. We passed cafes on the way to the memorial and after the memorial there is the Serpentine where you can go out on the water on a pedlo, or sit in a deckchair. There is also a swimming pool here but we didn't actually see it.You can spend all day here and not be bored. We only had a couple of hours and managed to run up nearly 10000 paces on our fitbits."

We had no children with us, but mused how our two year old grandson would have loved splashing in the interactive fountain. Many children were in bathing suits, having planned this destination, but just as many were stripped down to undies, or went in fully clothed, and all were thoroughly enjoying themselves. The fountain is a large oval shape, situated on a slope, with gentle rivers of water not more than 6-8 inches deep at the most running down both sides. My husband even kicked off his shoes and socks, rolled up his pant legs and joined in the fun. A great place for the kids to enjoy.... and adults, too."

It's a really good place with different kind of colorful flowers and trees. I went there in the summer at 18 o'clock and there was a really superb sunset. Me and my friends sat in the outside part of Sepertine Bar and enjoyed the time there. This bar and restaurant is a good choice for some drinks and snacks after work. But, it's really crowded between 5pm and 8pm (in the summer, at least). Everybody leaves work and goes there to relax. There isn't a lot of tables outside and the inside part is really hot with no air conditioning. So you have to go earlier! What I most liked of this restaurant was the view. It is in front of a huge lake and you can feel the pure air and good vibes. There was a lot of people on the paddleboats that you can rent for free. If you don't want to go to the restaurant, there are some chairs available for free in the park and you can sit for drink or a meal. The atmosphere is fantastic, there are a lot of kids playing, squirrels, birds, ducks. There's also a fountain memorial to Princess Diana. In the summer, a lot of people and kids go there to refresh, because it looks like a river and there you can paddle your feets and hands. Hyde Park is closer to Kensigton Palace, Albert Memorial and Winter Wonderland. You can't miss it!"

After a visit to the Palace, walking back through Hyde Park, we came upon comfortable beach chairs for rental. At 1.60 per chair per hour, not cheap, but very welcome - it was hard to not doze off looking at the water, birds, and people walking along. Several places around the water to stop for tea, ice cream and food."

We walked all round the serpentine (the lake). The rose garden is very pretty, even if you're not into roses go and have a walk through. The Diana memorial fountain is really nice, we visited it on a hot day and there were lots of children playing in the run offs from the fountain, I even dipped my feet in. I always want to visit this park when I go to London."

Hyde Park is a prime example of something the English have been doing for generations and they just keep getting better at it. Between the flora and fauna it is a venerable menagerie of wildlife and nature right in the middle of a beautiful and bustling metropolis of one of the world's most lovely and exciting cities. I would strongly advise anyone with a spare moment or two to take the time to find the Peter Pan statue as it is a stunningly crafted specimen of art in its own right but also a wonderful tribute to the innocence and beauty of childhood. Soak in the birds and squirrels and the frolic through the sometimes tall grass, languish under the shade of a billowing tree with a picnic if the sun has granted you the warmth of its presence. If you want a taste of something more structured, make your way to Kensington Palace and wander through their gardens, also beautiful and well maintained. This is a free park that is the height of what a city park can offer, don't miss out!"

However, services including eating at the Rangers Lodge, are exorbitantly expensive. The view of the Rangers Lodge overlooking the lake is lovely and given that one may be at Hyde Park for many hours, one might be ready through the teeth for having a drink or something to eat. I don't find its fair that in Hyde Park one doesn't have the option of buying better value snacks - if one is there with children, one might end up paying a packet for a family meal at the Hyde Park restaurant. If a family is going for a day at Hyde Park's I would suggest buying some bottled water and some other delicious good-value snacks from some supermarket. Then one might take a tea/coffee at the Hyde Park restaurant without breaking the bank with the meal bill.If weather permits, taking a paddle boat on the lake is a lovely relaxing activity. Again, since the service is given by a monopoly, the prices for a family become rather steep. Personally, I would spend less at the restaurant and splash on the paddling boat experience."

First thought was that the language from one particular 'orator' was a little bit ripe to say the least! OK, we're adults, but there were many children present, certainly within earshot, and these comments were extremely OTT particularly on a Sunday morning! We then strolled down toward the Serpentine. What's happened to the grass? It looked like it was dying there were many,many bare patches and it certainly wasn't verdant. I appreciate it's the middle of 'summer' but I was unaware we are in a drought situation. During the amble we were obliged to avoid several cyclists on this path where clearly there are signs \"No Cycling\". No policing either. There also is a distinct lack of Public Conveniences. The one we did locate, with queues, particularly the unfortunate 'Ladies', required a 20p payment. So many people don't carry cash these days........this needs a wee bit of consideration please."

We got to see swans and ducks, and wandered along wide paths under weeping willows and other beautiful trees. We also stopped at a cafe and got coffees to carry with us through the park. We ended our walk on the opposite side of Hyde Park, at the famous Speakers Corner. It was a lovely way to spend the afternoon, and it took less than 2 hours to walk the length of the park. The only downside is that if you want to stop and sit by the water, they RENT the chairs (I would like to point out that in Paris, the chairs in the gardens are free!)"

We started Kensington Palace end (off High Street Kensington next to the Royal Garden Hotel). Kensington Palace is right there which is great to visit, no queues, has a lovely caf\u00e9 and has toilets. We then walked through the park past the round pond down to the Serpentine and then stopped at the Diana Memorial Fountains, the Lido Caf\u00e9 then round to the Boat House and hired a Pedalo (bit pricey at \u00a324 for 1/2 hour for family of 4) but was still great. We then walked down to Hyde Park corner cover the whole park from one end to the other. On our second visit I took my Mum who is disabled. I called Liberty Drives and they collected us in a golf buggy from the entrance on the Broadwalk off High Street Kensington and rove us all around the park seeing everything from the Peter Pan playground to the Albert Memorial and the Serpentine Gallery and dropped us off at the Memorial fountains after touring for over an hour and a half. We then walked for a bit before we left the park. Cannot recommend Liberty Drives enough. Makes such a huge park so easily accessible to disabled. Well done Liberty Drives."

We also rented the Santander bikes from the Hyde Park station. There are plenty of paths you can cycle on too. Beautiful lakes and gardens. Wonderful getaway from the busy streets of London!"

I just never thought about it! I assumed it would be too small, too crowded and too plain. I was very surprised. We had a big walk around part of it - maybe we will go back and finish it. The rose gardens and cafes tempted us and we enjoyed our drink and snacks too long!It was busy (it was a hot sunny Sunday) but there is enough of the park to walk away from the crowds. There's something for most - pond and boating - if that's what you want, cafes and snacks and larger areas either grass or areas with trees. Its nice that they have let some areas of the grass grow more.And even some unusual (and apparently famous) architecture and art installations. Like I said something for most people to enjoy a relaxing morning or afternoon."

Their breakfast, entrees like fish and chips as well as pizza are yum. So is the icecream which the kids downed in a sec. There are games like scrabble available and activity pgs n pencils for kids.The boat ride is addictive and lounging on the deck chairs ( even though they cost per hour per person) is definitely recommended. If you plan ahead and go you may be able to see a live concert or performance. The winter wonderland here near Xmas is a sight n not to be missed."

Skateboards, bikes and walkers all share the many paths that intersect throughout the park. Nonetheless, the most interesting area to visit was Speakers Corner. Historically, this corner in Hyde Park, gives voice to many opinions and creates conversations from anyone willing to stand-up on their ladder or soap box. In fact, that's where the term, Soap Box, came from. Spend some time and enjoy the political rhetoric or civil complaints."

It is a lovely oasis of serenity walking along the long quite boulevards or winding pathways engulfed by all those magnificent trees.

We rented bikes to get there, and parked them just outside the park. I think it's also possible to use bikes in some areas in the park, but we parked them outside just to be sure. Then we walked around the park and visited the Peter Pan statue and the speakers corner, which we both enjoyed. Then we bought lunch at the benugo(?) cafe and had a picnic in the park. It was a great atmosphere with enough people to not feel lonely, and little enough to not feel like it was overcrowded. After our lunch we rented a boat for and hour and saw the park from a different perspective. I imagine this being a fun activity for anyone (families, couples, friends whatever). The only thing I would comment is that we found very few cafes/restaurants in the park. Benugo was very crowdy and it would have been good with some more options."

Despite its huge size of few hundred acres, you could still lots of visitors everywhere in this hot summer evening and most of them were enjoying the sunbath or relaxing near the lake. From their outlook, you know they were mainly Middle East and Asian tourists. I like Serpentine lake with the refreshing view and wildlifes & the noticeboard reminding people that it is an offence to harm wildlifes here. Kensington Park is just next to it and could be visited together (it is just too huge to walk for a lot of people)."

You can get the bikes near the Marble Arch entrance to ride through the park (for a small cost - use the Santander Cycling app), the grass is relatively clean too. Rode the pedalow in the large pond with the ducks, which was a great activity to do on a hot day. It cost us \u00a312 per person for an hour and staff there were cheery and helpful. There were loads of groups, couples and families enjoying the park and this activity too (on a hot Monday). The queue for the pedalow wasn't long at all but can imagine it may at the weekend.I'd imagine more maps would be nice and helpful for those less familiar with the park."

We are often in London but really have never spent too much time in Hyde Park except for the Winter Wonderland (or some such) that our friends take their children to. But this time we were at the end of a trip and staying across the road on the north side of the park at the Lancaster Hotel, and decided that we just wanted some recharge time for ourselves before traveling home. Hyde Park --- as many other reviewers have noted, was the perfect spot. The relief it provided from the hustle and bustle we had been dealing with in London for the couple days before that was remarkable and provided a much needed opportunity to stroll, chat, and generally relax. For those in need of a break, even if only for an hour or two, it\u2019s highly recommended."

Hyde Park is normally a beautiful tranquil haven to walk around in London.But Take That and fellow performers, including Olly Murs, Ella Eyre and Jamie Lawson, transformed all that into a fantastic music venue that we shared with 65,000 others on a Saturday night in July.The concert was part of the British Summer Time 10-day series featuring the best of pop, rock, dance, indie, and soul acts. This year there was a choice of headliners such as Take That, Mumford and Sons, Florence and the Machine, Carole King, Stevie Wonder, Pharrell Williams, Corinne Bailey Rae, King and Massive Attack. With two stages to choose from, a myriad number of bars and restaurants and other attractions, this was a fantastic day out and a great use of the parkland.Take That were fabulous and we will definitely look out for this concert series next year.Just a word to the organisers - please put in more ladies toilets next year, the queues were ridiculous."

This park is stunning, as a natural botanical garden features so many types of plant life, wild life and social life you'll be amazed. If you like to people watch this is the place! Beauty is abound everywhere you look and its close Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby, and White Hall and Big Ben! Hyde Park is to London, what Central Park is to London! Lovely!"

A great location for watching live bands and it was well organised. The park is nice to walk around on a hot summers day, especially with a picnic! There are plenty of bikes available to hire to ride around the park. Winter Wonderland is also very good. What amazes me is the amount of planes you see coming in to land; literally every 30 seconds or so! So defo the place for plane spotters..."

We had a brilliant evening but was packed so once you found a place you had to stay put. Visited Hyde Park in June and I just find it so lovely you cannot believe that you are not far from the city. You can easily spend a whole day just walking around or sitting relaxing there. One of my favourite parks in London."

I love Hyde Park and have walked through it many times from Paddington Station to get to where I need to go rather than take the tube. I have visited in all weathers, from sitting and enjoying the peaceful surroundings on a sunny day to wintery walk in the snow!I have attended the Christmas Winter Wonderland at Hyde Park which to be honest wasn't really very wintery or wonder'y and certainly not for me, although the kids did enjoy this expensive tacky evening out and I would recommend the tasteful ice sculptures.But for the first time ever I recently attended BST Festival at Hyde Park to watch Take That. We arrived at around 1.30pm and enjoyed lunch from one of the many vendors but from around 4pm onwards you could barely move around the site as people were stood blocking all of the paths, this was such a shame and we chose to starve rather than fight our way through the crowds to find dinner. By the time the main act arrived on stage, I really did feel pretty suffocated by the 65,000 strong sell out crowd. The show was awesome and the atmosphere pretty amazing, although I couldn't see the stage or the big screens very well, I was still very happy to be there experiencing it. I stress you really do need to arrive super early to get a decent spot.At the end of the show as 65,000 people headed towards the exits, many of the actual park exits were closed for crowd control making the leaving process confusing and absolute carnage. I would definitely attend another concert here but I have definitely learnt from my first experience and may even upgrade tickets for a better view."

For my sister's special birthday treat I spent \u00a3500 on two tickets to see Carole King sing her wonderful album Tapestry from the Diamond View section of Barclaycard Summer Time 2016 in Hyde Park. It was billed as the best view of the stage. Imagine our horror when she came on only to sit down at her piano at the back of the stage which completely obscured her from the view of all of us who were occupying this alleged hallowed bit of turf in Hyde Park. Those who had paid less than half the price of our tickets got the full view of Carole, seated, singing her heart out. The set was short and the number of times she left the piano stool were even shorter. Think hard before you part with your money for this type of gig. When I complained I was basically told it was 'tough' and that the artist decides where to sit. So don't read the promotional rubbish about what you will get for your money. I agree with another reviewer that the food and drink were hugely over-priced and particularly poor. The weekend cost me well over \u00a31,000 with travel and hotel. It was from my savings. I wish it was still in my bank, that I had stayed at home, played the album and taken my sister on holiday instead. Be warned."

Having looked forward to this for quite some time, the show itself was amazing - all the acts put on a fantastic performance - especially Take That as usual. However I think the organisation of the event itself was appalling. We arrived at Hyde Park and asked a member of staff where the queue was for south entrance priority. We were shown and dutifully joined the end of the queue, only for the same girl and another member of staff tell us we were in the wrong place and needed to go further up and pointed us in the \"right\" direction. We went and were met at the gate where we were directed to go to be by two very confused members of staff who informed us we needed to go to the back of the queue we had just come from or find where the priority queue ended and general admission begun. We walked back the length of the queue and everyone seemed to be priority so we went to the back again and ended up further back than we were when we started - naturally no one was accepting responsibility for this despite speaking to several members of staff! We stayed in the queue and we got in and found a place on the first bit of grass not far from the barriers that sperated us from the VIP section. We sat down at approximately 1240. As the afternoon went on we were enjoying the sunshine and the music and people were sitting on the grass beyond the path that was just behind us. However as the day got later and the bigger acts like Ella Eyre and Olly Murs were coming on people were standing on the path (at least 3/4 people deep)making it difficult to get from one place to another or even get to the toilets! The poor people who had been sitting on the grass behind them since 1pm now couldn't see a damn thing because people who had come later were just standing everywhere. In my opinion once the first section of grass had been filled there should have been some barriers put up or some kind of control as to where people were standing - the path should have been kept clear as this was a blatant health and safety issue. We saw a poor girl having a panic attack and no one around her was willing to move or give her some space despite her crying and pleading and the staff were no where to be seen, and it took at least 20 mins to get from where we were at post 6 to the toilet (probably a minutes walk at most!) I also myself witnessed a man pushing a lady in a wheelchair trying desperately to get through on the path but to no avail, and again no staff anywhere to help them so I did it myself and upon asking people politely to mind out of the way getting a lot of evil looks until they realised there was a wheelchair behind me. Once Olly Murs had come on the section in which we were standing had at least trebled in the amount of people and we found this very unfair as we had paid extra and been sat in the same spot and been trampled on all day only for people to come in and push their way to the front. The staff were very few and far between and although their is nothing that can be done for people pushing in, the queuing was ridiculous and the sheer number of people blocking the path through the park was absolutely obsurd and definitely should have been kept clear. I would have thought this has been brought up before as so many events have been held at HP - maybe this is some thing to bare in mind for future events as it was despicable and unsafe!"

Got a lovely spot as did numerous other priority ticket holders, like true British you always leave a small space between your picnic blanket and the next persons, keep with me and you will see what Im getting at!Everything going well until the bands start to play and the people behind with general admission tickets see that space and there Im now staring at a backside or being trodden on by someone trying to get closer to the front pretending that they have lost someone or are looking for someone. In the end you have no choice but to pick up your picnic blanket and stand to guard your space. Why you cant have a section for priority ticket holders like premier I dont know. Also if the footpaths were kept free more people would visit the food outlets.The concert itself was first class Take That, Olly Murs and Ella Eyre The staff are very helpful and try and help but as the night wears on you end up going with the flow.I will get Premier or VIP ticket next time."

Further down is a statue of Peter Pan that needs to be seen by the eye, no description can capture the monument. At the end of my walk was an Italian Garden with numerous fountains and flowers with people eating ice cream and spending time together. It is a must see in London."

The weather was very unpleasant on the day of our recent visit, cold, windy and at times light rain, we were making our way through the park after a visit to the V&A museum to visit the Australian War Memorial just outside the gates of the park. The day had be planned to have a picnic lunch in the park that was before the weather turned fowl. It was disappointing that the park has the minimal amount of seating and difficult to locate. We found a few bench chairs down by the Serpentine Lake out in the open, there did not appear to be any seating with shelter from the elements in this section of the park that we walked, let's hope that there is somewhere else in the park."

There was actually a table free to enjoy a coffee looking over the Serpentine and this year's Serpentine Pavilion is a particularly interesting and elegant structure.

You can rent the Boris bikes and ride but it takes about 45 minutes to walk it's length on foot. Start at Marble Arch and finish at Kensington Palace. If you wish to rent a paddle boat or row boat on the lake it's expensive but can be romantic or a bit of fun. The Princess Diana Memorial fountain is good for young children on a warmer day. The park connects to St James's Park and Green Park so you can go through to Buckingham Palace as well. Good for picnics. Can be busy in peak season and on weekends in parks but it doesn't take long to get away from the crowds into a quieter part of the park. Somewhere the Londoners like to go to as well."

We were not disappointed. Helpful staff, great fast food venues, clean and plentiful loos and abundantly staffed bars all helped add to the great music of Louise Goffin, Don Henley and the magnificent Carole King. There is an opportunity to upgrade your ticket once you get there but we decided not to and enjoyed watching with a huge and joyous crowd, the addition of big screens added to our enjoyment.

I love that the people living in the bustling city of London have such a wonderful green space to escape to. Enjoyed seeing the people walking their doggies. If you are a gardener or just love flowers, take a walk through here for a visual feast."

We are incredibly grateful we did. We had no idea how extensive the park is. We only explored a small portion ( our feet were killing us after two days of being tourists) but it was so peaceful. It is similar to Central Park in NYC but less congested. If you want a break from history and culture ( or shopping and the hustle and bustle of a vibrant urban center) come to Hyde Park. You may find the bucolic serenity just what you needed."

We were planning to visit all of the statues but somehow ended up in Kensington gardens instead, so would've enjoyed a trail of some kind too. Perhaps that'd interest the kids as well too!

You can take a boat on the Serpentine lake or go swimming. There are ducks and swans.On a sunny day, many people come out to picnic in the park. The park is famous for the Speakers Corner where many people have made their speeches. As a tribute to the late Diana, Princess of Wales - there is a memorial fountain.On the eastern side of the Serpentine is the Serpentine Bar & Kitchen. It serves a range of hot meals and snacks, salads and sandwiches. There are also some tempting cakes in the bakery and drinks in the bar.On the southern side of the Serpentine near the Diana memorial fountain is the Lido Cafe Bar which is a nice place to have a rest on the outdoor seating. The facilities include toilets too.If you have time, you should visit the Rose Garden which is in the south east corner of the park, near Hyde Park Corner. The Garden opened in 1994 and is a popular place to visit especially during the early part of summer when it is a good time to see the roses. The Rose Garden has a rather grandiose pergola.Many cyclists and joggers can be seen in the park too."

We really enjoyed renting a paddle boat and then grabbing some drinks to relax with on the grass. The rental bikes are also a great way to get up to Kensington Palace to see it and the gardens. We rented them right outside the Hyde Park Corner tube station one morning and biked along the designated path up to Kensington, where we returned them.

There are 2 cafes along the way, which were perfect for a coffee or snack break.Also recommend passing by the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain along the way for a quick visit."

There are some great things to see in Hyde Park, including the speakers corner (close to Marble Arch stop), the Diana, Princess of Wales memorial, the holocaust memorial, the 7 July Memorial, and a number of interesting sculptures throughout.

When starting at Hyde Park corner you can walk along the Serpentine lake which turns into Long Water as you progress into Kensington Gardens, then walk back on the other side.

I was extremely lucky that my hotel was walking distance from amazing, most beautiful and restful park i have ever encountered...I visited London for two weeks, and went out everyday, but before going anywhere, i walked by Hyde Park, where people rode bikes, walked their pets, sat by beautiful fountains and enjoyed life.. Even when we got a bit of rain, we waltzed around the park with umbrelas. Friendly squirrels came up to my hand..Grey and Brown baby bunnies hopping amongst the bushes and trees. .Beautiful swans gliding on the lake, multicolored ducks and birds dressed in tuxedo look alike coats... ...On one of my visits i had lunch at a restaurant right there inside the park in front of a lake, It was delicicious, A scrumptious salmon s\u00e1ndwich and a great glass of White wine.....I was there in the month of May, 2016.. I loved London, i shall return, and certainly will visit Hyde Park again."

I checked the map and it looked manageable to reach Buckingham Palace from the area we stayed just North of Kensington Gardens. Yes, it is doable, but I do not recommend it. Hyde Park is far larger than one would expect for a park in the middle of a city, and that is partially because Hyde Park did not used to be part of the city exactly. It was on the outskirts. Now, it is surrounded by bus and Tube stops. You can take a walk, bring a stroller, bring a dog, ride a bike, shoot photography, really the park has so many lovely facets to it that there is something for everyone and I recommend visiting it to take a break from the intensity of London. It was such a peaceful area, and a really wonderful combination of carefully landscaped but somewhat rustic. We walked there most days and absolutely loved it."

There are several different parts, ranging from beautiful flower gardens with sculptures and cascades, to open grassed areas, and of course, the huge Serpentine lake.There are plenty of benches everywhere and it doesn't feel crowded. There are several food outlets dotted around, offering a range of food, from snacks to full meals, which you can eat overlooking the water on terraces.There are lots of pedal boats available to hire. Also a big attraction are the copious swans, ducks, Egyptian Geese, herons and many more species. We were lucky today to see many fluffy chicks too! Squirrels here are spectacularly tame and fearless and you will be able to get up close to them!On one side of the Serpentine is the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, which you may easily miss if you are looking for a traditional memorial. It's a sort of circular pathway of stone with a gentle cascade of water. It has a separate review page on here.Finally, but essentially, toilets are available next to some of the cafe areas!"

It is well worth checking the web to see what events are happening in London during your visit to the City.To mark the Queens Coronation, we saw the 41 gun salute at Hyde Park (Marble Arch). The experience was great.A royal band march through the park, playing a variety of tunes and that alone is great to see.In the distance, across the park hundreds of military on horseback come into view, bringing with them the cannons. They speedily dismount, set up the cannons, and those that are not part of the firing squad (probably not the correct terminology), depart, taking the spare horses with them. With style and precision, that only the military have, the salute takes places and the cannons are fired. Its loud! A great event to watch - no matter what the weather - in one of Londons fabulous parks."

When we were in London for four days recently I walked there every day and enjoyed every one of them, never felt threatened and in fact felt very calm and happy using the park. There are miles of paths for walkers and runners. Thankfully bicycles are banned from the park though I do believe that there are some designated bike paths there but I didn't see many of them when I was there. The park is beautifully maintained, and the water features (Italian Garden, The Diana memorial and of course the Serpentine) are exceptional. There are hundreds of acres of grass to sit on, run on, play on and enjoy. We picnicked there twice. The best picnic location in all of London. When you visit the park, there are large maps displayed at each of the gates and to be honest navigating your way around is pretty easy. However I do recommend that you have a map of your own of the park (most hotels will have one) so at least if you do feel a little lost or you need to gauge a walking distance you can do so.To give you an idea, a leisurely walk from Marlborough Gate on the south side of the park to the Albert Memorial on the north perimeter side only takes about 15 minutes.If you don't visit Hyde Park when you visit London,then you really haven't visited London. DO IT."

Travelled all the way from east London and the park is nothing but open green space and waste land. Lots of people sunbathing or having picnics and have to walk miles to get to the lake or to anywhere that isn't just grass! I'm just glad I visited before bringing my photography group here as would've been a complete nightmare - not suitable for anyone with a disability or elderly as there is far too much walking involved. I hear they have lots of events here so at least all that waste land is suitable for something I suppose! I have visited here before around Christmas when winter wonderland was open and that was crap too. The name \"Winter wonderland\" makes you think fake snow, Christmas lights, Christmas market, mulled wine and beautiful atmosphere... Couldn't be further from what it is, it's basically just a glorified funfair and would never go again! "

Lots of people on a beautiful sunny day! Some were on benches, or on the grass, others rented lawn chairs and were sunning themselves. Many families with strollers and baby carriages passed by. There were ducks of all sorts and plenty of action as they flew and landed. A couple of shops were sprinkled in, supplying sundries and souvenirs. We found the Boathouse and planned to rent a Paddleboat (but we didn't). The restaurant we passed has a large deck and it was crowded with young people enjoying the lake view along with lunch. We saw Speakers' Corner, but no soapbox for me to climb to vent my political spleen, but there were picnic tables and a food stand. The one thing that made me nervous was the activity. The bikers and skaters and runners came up on us suddenly, and with children I was unnerved. Had I been familiar with the road markings and the rules, I would have been more relaxed, I'm sure. But as a Grandmom, I was afraid of an accident, due to my slow reaction time, or swaying walk. Eventually, we moved to the grass and that solved it.It was a very beautiful scene and an oasis in the City.Great planning, a City of London!!"

There is a hefty fine if the park keepers catch you. You would think that with all of the paths available, bikes would be welcomed over then entire park, but that is not the case. We had to take the bikes onto the really busy streets, or we had to walk the bikes half way around the park which was disappointing.

It's more like walking along a country lane at the moment (and equally uneven).It would have been nice if the park could have been opened during these works to get away from the dark road."

The biggest park in Central London, Hyde Park is the best place to hang out for picnics and ball games.Situated near Oxford Street, Park Lane and Knightsbridge, Park Lane provides all-round happiness and is the perfect place to reflect and get away from life. Some people think you need to get out of London for a quiet spot, but Hyde Park will more than provide tranquil happiness if you walk far enough in, particularly around the Serpentine lake where boats and a restaurant can be seen and where you can have food whilst watching the local wildlife.During the Summer, around July, the park is used for a series of concerts, called HYDE PARK CALLING. 2016's schedule includes Carole King performing her classic album TAPESTRY in her first concert since the 1980s and Stevie Wonder performing his classic album SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE. The week before these concerts, the arena created for them opens up free, where there are free outdoor screenings of classic films like GHOSTBUSTERS, TOP GUN and DIRTY DANCING, watched with headphones. Early arrival is recommended to bag a good spot, whilst watching the film with lager in plastic cups.Previous years have seen the likes of The Rolling Stones perform a free concert in 1969, Blur making a comeback concert, Cliff Richard performing as part of the Route of Kings concerts in 1999 and Shania Twain. Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney had their set cut short performing TWIST AND SHOUT due to noise restrictions after complaints from local residents. It was also the venue for LIVE 8 in 2005, where Madonna performed RAY OF LIGHT and the little girl who was starving in the LIVE AID companion video to the song DRIVE by The Cars, made a triumphant appearance to inspire generations that it is possible to rise above any bad situation.At Christmas, between November and January, part of the park is closed to make way for Winter Wonderland, a purpose built Christmas-themed village where fairground rides and European food and drink delicacies can be tasted whilst a soundtrack of classic Christmas UK hits booms out over the loudspeakers around the area. The centrepoint of the event is the Bavarian Village Hall, where European cover bands serenade and stimulate the audience with classic hits to a diet of German Sausage and Beer.When there isn't anything on, simply find a spot in good weather and enjoy."

On sunny days take sunscreen.

I used to walk through the two royal parks regularly. They're expansive but never moved me and generally left me cold. The city encroaches on three sides with no buffer. Not to mention the utterly abysmal Hyde Park Corner, a cacophony of pedestrian-unfriendly concrete and superfluous monuments. I defy you to attempt to navigate across Hyde Park Corner to Green Park (a gem in itself) without developing a general distaste for this intersection.I contrast this with Regent's Park, which is my favourite of the royal parks. There, John Nash's wonderful terraces on three sides and the off-center nature of the gardens at the southeast corner of the park make for subtle vistas broken by trees and natural barriers. A much more human scale. And, abutting Regent's Park, in contrast to the sterility of Mayfair and Knightsbridge, and the grit of Bayswater and Notting Hill Gate surrounding Hyde Park, one enjoys the gentility of St. John's Wood, Primrose Hill and Marylebone.After 20 years away I began travelling to London regularly on business a year ago. I've revisited Hyde Park several times and it still doesn't move me. Instead, if I have time for a large park, it's Regent's and Primrose Hill. And for a small park to call your own, check out Holland Park, which is a lovely gem.I realize that my opinion is heresy to tourists, and perhaps even Londoners, who feel that they must visit Hyde Park and enjoy it. By all means go. It has its charms, particularly late on an autumn or early spring afternoon under a brooding sky. But then go to Regent's and note the substantial difference, variety, and humanness it embodies. I believe you may end up agreeing with me and spending your time accordingly."

I was hoping to find a food kiosk to buy a sweet roll and some coffee, or a snack of some type as I walked around, but no luck. Maybe I was too early, or maybe I was just in the wrong part of the park, though I covered a lot of territory. Hyde Park runs into Kensington Gardens. Do walk over to the Albert Memorial if you get a chance. I was surprised by how grand it is. Not necessarily beautiful, but makes obvious the love Queen Victoria had for her husband."

Only a stone's throw to the major museums and Harrods. You can spend hours exploring the park, there's a system of roads and paths that are ideal on bicycle or you can stroll through the grass on foot. Beautiful greenery and a hint of the English countryside right in the heart of chaotic London (no comparison to actually visiting the countryside). Well worth a visit!"

There were people on roller skates doing intricate routines, cyclists slow and fast cutting up the roads, pedal boats for those unlike me who can actually swim! A woman teaching another hula hoop routines. It's a fantastic place to people watch, if thats your kinda thing."

It is possible to take a boat ride on the lake and there are ample paths for walking and jogging. If you want a rest, deck chairs are available for hire for a small fee. There is a lovely bar and kitchen overlooking the water which serves casual snacks and more elaborate meals. The park is within easy walking distance of many of the main tourist attractions of London and we recommend it should be explored.

We had sesame seeds and the loved them. I had 6 sitting on me at one stage. Further on is the Princess Diana memorial. I am not a royalist but this is a beautiful memorial that is extremely peaceful , a great place for meditation. Further on we got on the pedalo boat. They cost \u00a314 for two of us.

Richard Branson, David Beckham, Jordan Belfort just to name a few. It was a Saturday afternoon and the skies were clear. As i sat down on the bench and tried to let my mind conceive the fact that a dream of mine had come true. I felt extremely overwhelmed and almost in a state of \"trance\". It was like heaven people of different races, cultures and religions. Different languages and accents were heard and the lush beauty of Hyde Park.It was beyond words and perhaps I had a glimpse of what beauty people see in it and why people who are successful in there on different ways have a big connection to Hyde Park.

There were lovely walking trails and many people had small dogs running (making me wish I had my havanese, Jasper to walk), plus young children were out playing. Kensington Palace also had beautiful gardens with lovely tulips just blooming. I took the Kensington Palace Museum Visit which was one of my favorite. It felt really intimate and so interesting to see the dresses that Princess Diana wore. Seeing Queen Victoria's room and her grand room and bedroom with all her letters and items felt like being at a friend's home.

This British park is overwhelmingly large with Pride and Prejudiceish-type sprawling lawns with primarily swans, fountains and pedal boats to break up the monotony. I have walked through this park twice, once in the rain and one during clear weather. It is beyond serene and the laws in England are such that not only were cars not allowed to drive through the park but even bicyclists were largely precluded from disturbing any pedestrian foot traffic."

The Sunken Garden was lovely with tulips, the Diana Memorial fountain was peaceful and unique in its water tumbles. The Serpentine waters were filled with beautiful swans.

Hire one of the Santander bicycles to cycle around or take a paddle boat out. There is so much to do.I have previously organized days out with picnics and games to enjoy a cheap day out bonding with friends and family. When you need be it more drinks or food, the walk to purchase more is only a few minutes walk away. If you are lucky to live or work nearby, you could go for a daily jog around the park. It's great fun. Speakers corner is a place to visit especially at the weekends."

I started my walk around the park at the Albert Memorial and walked around the east side of the park to the bridge and crossed over it and then walked down the side of the river. It was a very sunny and nice day when I went and was a perfect day. This is an exceptional place for photographers to go to just take in the landscape and take pictures of the birds and all the flowers that are planted in the Princess of Wales portion of the park. This park on the east side drops right down close to Buckingham Palace and is an excellent all day adventure to explore."

One of the park's highlights is the Serpentine, an 18th century man-made lake popular for boating and swimming. Hyde Park is also where you'll find Speakers' Corner, a traditional forum for free speech (and heckling). We had a great time walking around the park and having a rest before going to visit other attractions. We wanted to see the Diana Memorial fountain and were glad we did. Also, the swans, ducks and squirrels were a joy to see."

I don't know if there were rules and that's why everyone seemed stiff necked but I wish I saw more kids running around playing chase, dogs caring sticks and people playing frisbee.I've created a list of things I have found myself short of and having to pay expenses eg prices for because I travelled unprepared.I hope this helps.........1.

In the Park, almost across from the Hilton Hotel, is the Princess Diana Rose Garden which is a joy to behold. There are two cafe's on the lake in the hotel. The one nearest the Rose Garden is far superior to the other one which is very ordinary. You can bike on the bike paths in the park or just walk around. Don't miss this beautifully kept treasure."

They've just installed brand new toilets with brand new payment gates.Since adopting Contactless with gusto, I now don't carry a wallet that takes change. Why bother, I thought.So, a nine year old desperate for the loo and no change. Just a \u00a320 note.The guy behind me just had a \u00a310 note.So what do we do?Fortunately, a lady was there - rather grumpy, but that's to be expected these days - and she let us through, with much tuttering.Message to the public sector.

The circular black and white floor mosaic commemorating The Reformers' Tree which was a focal point of the protests in 1866 to give all adult men the right to vote. The Isis Sculpture, with the poignant messages engraved around its base. The whole area is so community orientated for all ages alike.

Picked up some Boris Bikes near Trafalgar Square (well worth a go by the way), went up the Mall, up Constitution Hill, accross Hyde Park Corner to the park itself. So long as you are sensible on the bike, and use available cycling lanes etc the roads are lovely and wide making family cycling safer than you might imagine.Hyde park itself is as you would expect - the same as all urban parks - tranquility amidst the hustle and bustle. Both are a great way of spending a couple of hours out-doors and enjoying the atmosphere and scenery of the great city of LondonYou can take the longer South/North Carriage Drive lap around the outside of the park - vehicles permitted but again is pretty calm. Or, there are shared pathways inside the park. Please though, respect the no-cycling lanes - they are there for a reason, and even have a no-bikes-allowed picture for those less familiar with English"

The park is a perfect place for running. If you run along the edges of the park and a bit into Kensington Park, you can easily get a 10k run. The circular lake is good for interval running. It's also s great place with kids. We went there when our oldest daughter was approx 1 years old and she had fun. I can highly recommend going there in spring time, with cherry blossom and various shrubs flowering. Look for the small parrots /parakeets roaming in canopies of the park. There are also several refreshment points in the park along with a few cafe's, such as The Lido cafe. I could imagine the vibe of the place in swinging 60's with weirdos, mods, fashion freaks, beatniks, live music, hippies and acid heads running wild in the park.. \u263a"

The animals were wonderful and seems that they are well looked after. Lovely feeling of having a squirrel come up to you and take food from your hands, especially having never seen one before in my life. The swans were majestic. You can go up close to any animal and take a photo or even touch them gently if you'd like. Amazing experience. We also had a picnic in the park as one of the day was a bright shining sunny day and it was terrific! We had so much fun! Running around on the grass and playing ball.

We had a long morning walk here, in relatively chilly March morning. The park is absolutely gorgeous, with sprawling green spaces and actually almost disconnects you from the city around you. The Italian Gardens is a must see area here. The Albert memorial was stunning as well. The Kensington Palace is part of the park as well, but we did not get to visit it this time around. I would recommend"

One thing you must do when in London is to visit the Hyde Park, preferably on a Sunday and hear some interesting speeches at the Speaker's Corner and even ask some questions and participate in the impromptu debates, as I did when I visited London for the first time. Henry the 8th had confiscated the huge park area from the Westminster Abbey monks and made it a deer park for hunting - no entrance for the public. That was in 1536. Hundred and one years later Charles First opened the park to the public. The Sunday Trading agitation and the Suffragette's agitation for vote for women are only two of the famous gatherings there. Marx, Lenin, and Orwell and a plethora of famous people used to speak from the Speaker's Corner to give vent to their original ideas. A well dressed man who claimed that he was from Surinam was speaking (in excellent English) against the English and the queen when I first went to the Park. I interfered to ask him some questions. He used somewhat bad but imaginative language to mock at a young English pair kissing nearby. When I objected he invited me to come and share the venue. I still think he was really an Indian. The many other attractions of Hyde park, probably along with the adjacent Kensigton Gardens the world' third or fourth largest city park."

So, up to 60mph winds and rain had us ducking for cover often. That said...there were still hoardes of geese, swans and ducks on the water. There was a guy on one of the paths next to the water who was feeding the swans. No joke, the swans would come out of the water, let the guy pet them, and they they would take the food. We thought it was because they were familiar with him, as maybe he did this daily and had earned their trust. This was until he gave a couple passers-by, who were looking on, some bread crumbs too. The swans came over to them, took the food and let those people pet them too. As something we just happened upon, that was actually really awesome to see. Made it easy to ignore the wind and rain! The park itself is also really nice. Lots of pathways, and a lot of very green grass. Had it not been such a terrible storm, we would have probably stayed in the park a little longer."

We could hardly believe we were in the centre of London it was so unreal.We see Queens guards practising in the grounds, but i think the best experience was the wild Parakeets birds that were all flying around the park, so amazing to see these parrots in large numbers flying around with all the other wild birds, then we see a whole tree covered with them and two people feeding them monkey uts, some brave birds took straight from their hands others just swooped and took them, a truly amazing experience, cant wait to go back again in slightly warmer weather.

Westbourne, now underground, the top end of which has been turned into the fountains. The road at the bottom of the park was formerly called Rotten Row - I don't know the reason 4 this - and it used to be a very fashionable place to take a walk for young ladies, or debutantes,as they were called, especially on a Sun AM.At the northern end of the park, you will find Speaker's Corner. This is a very popular place to go and hear the various speakers, esp on a Sun morn. Just before the entrance to Hyde Park Corner station. a small cafe is to be found.

Otherwise, this is merely another public space, one that isn't meticulously manicured either. If you're looking for some peace and quite, then drop by, but if you're in search for amazing flora and lush gardens, don't bother. Yes, we visited in the winter, but there weren't any signs of greenery that will blossom in the spring either. On the west end is Kensington Palace, so you'll likely have to pass through it to get there.To arrive at the park, the nearest metro (tube) station is Hyde Park Corner on the blue line. If you plan on using public transportation more than twice per day, buy an Oyster Card (not a Visitor Oyster Card) for 5 pounds, then add 6.40 pounds per day since this is the daily cap for unlimited public transit use in Zones 1-2 (these zones encompass almost all tourist sights like Big Ben, Buckingham, Kensington, London Eye, etc). The 5 pound deposit is refundable if you go to a counter at any tube station before returning home (otherwise you'll have to request a refund by mail)."

I met a lot of friendly and kind local women who meet together to walk their dogs here in the mornings. the park is absolutely beautiful. It is also huge! I was also thrilled to see children riding their ponies on a horse track they have in the park. You can use the park as a thoroughfare between Paddington and the Royal Albert Hall and Harrods. The bird life is vibrant and there are lots of places in the park to explore."

Handicap accessible and spread out over a large area allowed crowds to move freely. The park is very large and easy to walk. Suggest attending Speakers Corner events or listening to street musicians or walking along the large lake.

I experienced this park on a sunny day and entered it after hopping off the tube at Hyde Park Corner. Do go and pay it a visit.

The park is loved and this is o so apparent from the truly kept nature of the green space.

Lots of places to get good food and drink. A very festive atmosphere with singers. Even if you don't want to spend money on the rides it is fun just watching.

It's absolutely crazy, there was just me and my boy and I'm glad we hadn't gone with more people as I think we would have lost them in the crowd. Some of the staff were lovely and helpful but some very curt and short with me when I asked where the ice palace and toilets were. Everything is extremely expensive but it is all very pretty. If it wasn't as busy I would consider returning although I wouldn't bother with the ice kingdom."

No animals involved so great even for animal rights activists too!!!! There are German market stalls, Bavarian beer stalls, pretzel stalls and lots of big rides. Bring the whole family!"

I thought that Hyde Park was supposed to be magnificent & beautiful, like NYC's Central Park, but it is not. Perhaps the name carries the park, with the exception of it being a lovely & open green space for locals."

There is also a cafe there and used to be a restaurant somewhere in the Serpentine area which was very good - it may still be there so would be worth looking up. But Hyde Park is really about getting some fresh air into your lungs, looking up into an open sky and absorbing the nature around you and the sound of the wind in the trees. It has a magic of its own and a history that encompasses generations of Londoners who love their city and cherish its open spaces. There are of course things you might not like there - including a spectacular brown rat which crossed our path once many moons ago in the park. But given the beasts are only a few yards away from you anywhere in the city - in Hyde Park they're likely to be further away rather than closer to you - and blame litterbugs not the park or the rat! Seriously, Hyde Park is beautiful and relaxing and, when on a long walk, eases the city soul. After a tough day at work in the late 1990s I often walked home through the park - and that part of the walk was always the nicest - loveliest part. There are concerts and fairs there on special occasions, but the bliss is the peace you will find there. I have no particular date although I'm forced to give one for the sake of it. The park is not supposed to change from year to year."

It is not like the tasteful parks you come by in Germany, France or Austria... Not so peaceful but you can enjoy it.One tip that might be interesting for you- there is a free-speech corner when you enter the park from Oxford St side. There many people there from different nationalities and with lots of ideas giving free speeches. You can also be one of them if you would like:)Enjoy!"

The staff was friendly and there was an abundance of food and beverage choices. This was the highlight of my stay in London that I came both nights I was here! Belgium waffles, mulled wine and German sausages, what more can a girl ask for. Oh yea and tons of rides and carnival games. I'm jealous we don't have a tradition like this in New York. I think I would visit London every year just for the Winter Wonderland. I had a blast!!"

We went late Sunday afternoon after a long day sightseeing and although it's probably the busiest, largest funfair you've ever been to, it's definitely well worth a visit even without children like we were (although if you do have children, 100% satisfaction is almost guaranteed!). There is absolutely everything from every manner of fair ground rides to stalls (angels market) and then there's the food and drink stalls!!! The biggest bit by far for food and drink is the Bavarian Village, and you can literally get everything from beer, cider, top quality cocktails, mulled wine, mulled cider, German sausage, salmon, pancakes, waffles, doughnuts, etc. It's very busy, but worth going, every one of your senses will feel assaulted but in a good way!"

Is very magical! Also in Autumn you see the yellow and red leaves like in the movies. Great to visit alone or with friends/family, just avoid the areas that are full of children, it ruins all its magic a bit.The only downside to me is that they close the gates I need at around 4pm, so I have go around it to go back to the hostel, and the sights are not so wonderful."

The park was noisy and crowded with people from tree to tree. Rather insane!In contrast, this visit was quiet. I was at Hyde Park on a chilly weekday and no one was around to disturb the peace. Not one speaker! I was actually disappointed because Hyde Park is famous for its orators.Entertaining me instead, was a residential red fox which peeked out from its den to hunt surreptitiously for food. With one eye on the tourists, it wandered around extremely familiar with its environment. I spent quite a bit of time observing the fox since I have not experienced seeing a wild fox at such close quarters. Do not touch or try to feed although a tourist tossed parts of a sandwich at it.If I am not mistaken, there is also a private riding school here. I watched the horses being exercised and kids learning to ride on them. The park was a haven from a noisy and crowded city of London. It was clean with many park benches available. They lured weary tourists and locals to sit a spell. Overstimulated by the many activities in London, the green of the park soothed the eyes and calmed the nerves. There were many miles of pleasant strolling on grounds which were well-kept and manicured.Adjacent to Hyde Park is Kensington Gardens. This is even more beautiful than Hyde Park. If time permits, hike over to Kensington Gardens also. There will be no regrets."

In most large cities you are unlikely to find such a large expanse of green as Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Its expanse attracts throngs of sunworshippers and picnicers in the summer. In off-peak times, it still offers enough sights to make it a worthwhile respite from the rush of the city. Hyde Park is adorned with many sculptures and statues worth seeking out along the pathways jutting out in all directions. The Serpentine is a particularly pleasant spot to do some bird and people watching, and even see an art exhibition at the gallery. When one says 'great' park, they mean GREAT in more ways than one."

The area is well laid out, with a variety of things to do, from skating, fairground rides for all ages, a room full of ice sculptures, markets, eating places and live entertainment. There is also an eating area designed along the lines of an 'Oktoberfest' complete with a sing-along. We had a good mooch around the markets then settled down with a mulled wine, a large portion of salmon cooked on an open fire (excellent) and listened to a chap singing an excellent repertoire of songs that included some Prince classics. All whilst sat next to a giant holding a woodpecker that whispered softly in German!"

It was many years ago that I spent a week in a rented flat just down the street from Hyde Park and the famous Speaker's Corner. Aside from the park there was fantastic shopping just nearby. This was a part of the park where anyone could get up on their soap box, and speak to the passers by and get their message or thoughts out in the air. It was interesting to view the different people. The park is huge and quite lovely. We found a little grocery just on the street nearby and enjoyed a snack as we watched the people. I enjoy people watching, and appreciate different cultures and the different ways people dress and live & carry on. This was a purely enjoyable experience & I couldn't say a negative thing about it, except the time I was there was too short."

During our first visit during 2013, we had walked the entire length of Hyde Park and enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere of the park. We visited London for a second earlier this year and we were again fortunate, in being able to spend some time in this splendid huge park.As we walked along the path next to the Serpentine, there were many people enjoying themselves onboard pleasure boats, on the water. We also walked past the Princess Diana memorial fountain. The fountain was full of children paddling in the water whilst there were many family groups enjoying themselves in the fenced grass area surrounding the fountain.Hyde Park is a great place to take a break from hectic tourist activities. There are plenty of park benches where you can give your feet a rest. If however, you feel the need to stretch your legs then there are plenty of paths through the park where you can take a good long walk."

Some just sitting and watching the ducks in the Sanctuary (the lake), some riding bikes, some playing baseball, some flying kites. It was so quiet and peaceful you would never know you were in a huge city. Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are basically one property with a large lake separating the two. On the Kensington side is a fountain in Diana's memory. Everything was so clean; no litter."

Do find the Diana's Memorial Fountain, great place to dip your feet in during hot days,"

There are also restaurants in the park.On its western side, Hyde Park merges almost seamlessly with Kensington Gardens It too has fine gardens. Of course, Kensington Palace is there too.On the southeast, Hyde Park is catty-corner with the Green Park, which once was the formal approach to Buckingham Palace. At the northeast corner is the Marble Arch, which once stood in front of Buckingham Palace.In any event, Hyde Park is a great place to relax and escape the bustle of the busy city."

The park in Autumn was an array of beautiful colours of reds , orange and Browns. Seems to be a park for everyone from joggers,cyclists, horse riders and walkers and kiddies. There were several places to get food and you could have a full English overlooking the Serpentine. There were a whole variety of waterfowl around the water, who were not in the least bit bothered about people. Squirrels happily came up close in case there was any chance of having a tasty titbit! You could also see and hear the green ring necked parakeets throughout the park.We walked as far as Princess Diana's water fountain which was sadly disappointing. There are play areas for the children but we didn't make it to Princess Diana's playground as we ran out of time."

Visit this amazing space and I'm sure you will not be disappointed. There really is so much to see and do this review can not do it complete justice rather detail what we saw and did and how we enjoyed ourselves. The things we have not reviewed are our extra motivation to visit again so perhaps all in all a very good thing. Just like the park itself!We had a family day out with plans to enjoy exercise, cycling (our daughter) and scooting (our younger son). Parking in one of the busy car-parks was a little time consuming as it is a very busy park but due to its sheer size a good investment of time and monies as by the time we returned we were pretty tired and given the park is free, the car park fees are a small price to pay when you add everything up.We set off to walk from the centre of the park to the playground at the far north westerly point. This allowed us to stroll through some stunning fauna and flora, past the beautiful Long Water, Serpentine, Diana Princess of Wales memorial pool and Italian fountains. All delightful and worth stop offs and/or visits in their own rights. In such a busy and densely populated and to a degree of course polluted London it is amazing to find such space, fresh air and relative quietness so close to the heart of the Great Wen. This and our exercise immediately made us feel a little healthier and a lot hungrier! On arrival at the play park after a not inconsiderable trek we were met with an absolutely stunning play area for children up to around 11 years or so. A climbing frame Pirate Ship which was stunning in design, a wigwam camp, several rock pools and sandpits not to mention the usual array of climbing frames, slides and swings. The children loved it. NB you may have to queue a little while but this is a small price to pay for not having to pay!, and well worth any wait. It also stops the volume of visitors being too much. The children loved it and there is a decent amount of refreshments and choice of available for us grown-ups nearby.Walking back over we chose not to visit the adjacent Pennington Palace (on another day we will though!) but stopped off at the Serpentine Gallery and Sackler Galleries which offered amazing free entry exhibitions in delightful surroundings. Well worth stopping off at for a dose of culture and caffine. Finally we visited the Diana Princess of Wales memorial water feature.It was awash with paddling, laughing, gamboling children having an absolute ball putting their feet in the water and joining the perpetual trail of fellow paddlers walking round and round the feature. We felt given her motherly love of all children that the memorial was both fitting and tasteful. It was delightful final stop off point for us in an amazingly enjoyable day."

I particularly enjoy Hyde Park for its variety. There is a lake full of ducks, geese\u2026..who feel entitiled to have a snack from every passerby. It is particularly entertaining to watch their antics around young kids. On a sunny day the park is full of joggers, walkers, cyclists, skateboarders, dog walkers\u2026\u2026.and even horse riders. There are a variety of trees, shrubs, flowering plants and manicured lawns. One can sit on the grass, wooden chairs, benches or duck into a cafe for a quick bite.During each season, winter, summer, autumn and spring the park takes on a different look & feel. During spring the colour bursts are particularly captivating. Hundreds of flowers spread throughout the park\u2026\u2026well presented, well tended."

Nice coffee shop that we had coffee in but we also took our own lunch and sat by the lake to eat it which even though it was a bit chilly it was fantastic none the less. We hired out a chair \u00a31.65 for an hour and sat for about 30min to break the riding up. There are a lot of places you cannot ride to/on so go for your ride and then you can revisit those places by foot. Hyde Park is a must visit spot."

I didn't know they charged a fee to sit in the chairs around the Serpentine Lake. But take some coins (pounds as I don't know what it costs now) with you as it is so fabulous to relax by Serpentine Lake and bird, people and dog watch! The park itself is vibrant and active with joggers and strollers and animals and it's just a wonderful day outside. At certain times of the year there will be a Christmas market at the corner of Hyde Park. Look for special events such as this depending on what time of the year you are visiting."

Having seen the Albert Memorial close up for the very first time, after a visit to the Natural History Museum, I decided to make the very most of a lovely sunny Saturday afternoon and take a walk in Hyde Park - another place that I barely knew.My original plan was to visit the Serpentine Gallery but, finding that the next exhibition was not yet ready to view - as I also found to be the situation at the Sackler Gallery - I just crossed back over Serpentine Bridge to see the Isis sculpture on the south side of the Serpentine and followed various path until I finally reached the Queen Elizabeth Gates.In my early days as a photographer, the National Monuments Record took a like to my eye for architectural detail and I was encouraged to photograph examples of good post-war architectural sculpture, as well as war memorials and a variety of other monuments and public art and sculpture.At Hyde Park, there was something to catch my eye wherever I went and I felt in my element! I spent a fraction under an hour there, and didn't actually take many photos because I still had the Wellington Monument etc to see, but it would be easy to spend a whole day or more exploring this wonderful place, with a good map."

Without doubt, Hyde Park is London's greatest unsung attraction. Towards the Marble Arch end, on any summer's day, you will be surrounded by people chilling, having a picnic, talking, walking, or playing ball. They will be from every far flung corner of this planet.Walk deeper into the park, along and of the many paths and you will discover little pavilions, streams and gardens.The park is best in summer when the trees that surround it are in full bloom. Then the sounds of the city are totally stifled and absorbed and the park takes on a majestic other-world feel. It also becomes timeless. Building restrictons prevent the construction of new buildings that overlook the park. I don't agree with these, but it has the effect of transporting the space from something urban into something rural.Check out the fountains that are opposite Lancaster Gate tube. From NottingHill follow the path that leads to the Royal Albert hall, and there's another that goes to Knightsbridge.On Sunday follow the Serpentine (an artificial lake) and enjoy the Swans, joggers, and pretty young things out for a stroll.You'll also find the Serpentine Gallery on the cross from from Lancaster Gate to KnightsBridge. Check out the exhibits. They are world class (fees often apply).Whether or sad and love-lost or king, or queen, of the world, there will be something magical to transport you to a different place.And if you have an opinion or two, there's always Speakers Corner. Here you'll hear every subject under the son debated with skill, passion and the kind of linguistic dexterity that will leave you aghast or giggling. No hate alllowed."

When we went on a Sunday morning there were crowds around 4 speakers. They were all giving a monologue on religion, politics or whatever else they wanted to spew about. The funny part was that some of the audience would start debating them to the point it got very very heated. Wow it was so entertaining and totally caught us of guard.

Best bet is to get the bikes you can, and wait for someone to return a bike. Also, if the light is red, something is wrong and it won't let you put the code in, so if you plan to \"lay claim\", make sure it shows green. Be aware, you can only bike up and down certain areas. Pretty park with nice ponds with paddle boats on some and a restaurant with outdoor picnic benches. Grab a cold one and people and bird watch for a bit. Of course, Kensington palace is also in Hyde Park if you desire pictures of the royal princes residence."

You can enter it in the north side and just take a walk, see the lakes, take some pictures of the birds, catch a coffee or a tea at the cafe and just absorb the simple pleasures of life. If you're in London during winter/Christmas time you can visit the Winter Wonderland a festive family favorite with ice skating, shows, and a huge Christmas market"

As there were families there people were spread out on rugs and blankets having picnics. All we heard was to move in closer to let more people in! It was a whole day event and being huddled together in the heat was not what we wanted. The minute you moved people encroached on your space. Not very well organised, too large a crowd. The main gate was closed when we came out and we had to keep askin for directions to get back to our hotel. Exit gate was too narrow. Good job was brilliant."

This was a fantastic way to get around the park. For the event itself, a few tips if you go next year as I couldn't find a lot; Arrive early, the tickets stated that the gates opened at 11:00 am, we got there at 10:30 am and there were already huge numbers there. Take a picnic blanket with you, it's a good way of getting a reasonable area for yourself as you will be there for a good ten hours. You can take chairs but you will have to sit quite a long way back and have less room. I'm sure there were a few \"blanket wars\" but we were surrounded by a lovely group who we came to know over the course of the day, just be aware that if you leave more than 6\" to the next blanket, someone WILL sit there! That's OK though and you will become friends once the music starts. Definitely take some food with you - although the concession stands were expensive the queues weren't too bad. Also take some plastic water bottles as there are free water refill sites near the loos. Speaking of which, I was surprised at how well the toilets handled 55,000 people! At no point did I have to queue for a cubicle and the staff on hand did an excellent job of keeping toilet paper and hand towels stocked up. My wife had a similar experience with the ladies toilets. I would definitely recommend this event and will no doubt try to go again next year."

We only managed about maybe a quarter of the park and after over three hours you need something to stimulate the brain. Will visit the park again, maybe in a different season?"

Lots of picnic spots, you can really enjoy it for a walk in a sunny afternoon... The park is really huge, so... use the Hide Park Corner entrance and turn on the left... you can really appreciate that part of it, but if you have time and you are fit, try to take a look of the whole park, till Marble Arch, Lancaster Gate and Kensington Gardens. Don't miss it! A W E S O M E !"

I thought what an awful idea! So we walked, and ended up feeling great bout the journey. We were actually in the park and get to see the parts we've never seen before on the park. There were this lake filled with swans and at some people were swimming too! Weather was great at that time completed the unexpected interesting journey for Chinese cuisine lunch!

It was absolutely a relaxing, funny and enjoying experience. We then met the rest of the family and we all had a cup of tea at the open air bar, watching the rest lake-bikes on their cruise. Having finished our tea, we continued our walk through this nice park and visited the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, where a lot of children were splashing and playing with the water. Finally, we could not miss the sportive little squirrels,playing hide and seek into the bushes. My daughter was thrilled to watch them and took a lot of pictures.

Lots of Walkers and Joggers, but such a huge and well maintained Park, that it never seems crowded. The cities we come from long to have a space like this !! Kudos to the authorities -- Maintenance is amazing. Multiple entry and exits with variable timings...better check before you enter...walking from one gate to another can take 30-45 mins and u don't wanna find the gate closed. Bang in the centre of London, close to all Attractions. After a tiring early day, one can come here around early evening and spend a couple of hours doing nothing and just enjoying Nature.

This is a good place to hire as there are TFL staff around to help. Go counterclockwise round the park from here and you will end up near Kensington Palace. Great for a \"rest\". Return the bike to one of the racks just off Knightsbridge and then go and get a picnic. There is 'arrods, but better value was Little Waitrose. Back to the park, hired deckchairs for 2hrs whilst having the picnic, bubbly and mid afternoon snooze. Then onto the Serpentine for rowing. This is not cheap but good fun and do these instead of the pedalo's.....less queuing."

If you are a fan of historical English romance literature you know that most of the aristocracy rode about the park daily to see and be seen on horseback or in carriages. You will want to see it yourself then but having said that, it is just a park. You need to remember that you are in a big city and that they really enjoy their green space. If you need fresh air, a place to tucker the kids out or an inexpensive way to spend an afternoon then this will work fine. It is large and has a lovely lake but again, it is just a park.

On a beautiful day loads of people are visiting the park and the atmosphere is relaxing and cozy. The park offers loads of different small highlights so there's always something to discover. Often you can find squirrels running around, some of them not too shy to take your food when offering it to them. On a hot summer day make sure to visit the Diana Memorial Fountain which is bustling with life then. Families come here to enjoy the cool water of the fountain so sit down and put your feet in the refreshing water. If you need a break from sightseeing and shopping, come to the Hyde Park to relax :-)"

We located the equestrian trails, the playground, squirrel sanctuary, the lake, and the nearby restaurant. When we found the fountain, we sat down and enjoyed the view of the river, the Iris Statute, and the fountain we were sitting on commemorating such an amazing lady.

My son (11) questioned why children were allowed to paddle in it if it's a memorial and I explained that Diana loved children so I'm sure she would be pleased. Carried on up and my son found a big bunch of house keys on the grass. We handed them in to a police car at the top of the park.

A boating lake provides a serene tableau for the meditative boulevardier to reflect upon. Vast plane trees sway in the breeze.

Hyde Park is a large area of open space with a range of lakes and other features that provide a level of tranquility not found in many other parts of London. Much to see and do. Children love the boat rides on the Serpentine Lake (itself offering good photo opportunities of the London skyline) as well as the Diana Memorial Fountain (bring a towel and walk around it - this is encouraged)Many people use the cycle scheme to ride around the park - a great way to explore the 350 or so acres of park. For the more athletic there are wide areas of paths and tracks to jog along.The location of the park is great too. Accessible by tube and bus from all sides, the park is used by both tourists and Londoners alike. We have visited the park on numerous occasions in all seasons and the impact of weather on visitor numbers is minimal - it really is an all year round park.December sees a large area of the park taken over by the Winter Wonderland. This is a wonderful (but can be pricey) mix of market and entertainment (rides mainly) with a fantastic feel and atmosphere. The park also hosts a number of open air concerts (many free) throughout the year - including amongst others The Proms!Whilst not perhaps one to visit if on a tight time schedule, those with a little time to spare will not be disappointed by a visit to this lovely park."

Its best to go in the late afternoon for jogging, as it can be quite chilly in the mornings."

It was a pleasant day so walked around the lake watching the many geese, ducks and swans resting by the side or swimming in the lake. Free toilets at the Lido were a welcome break and the joggers, cyclists, roller skaters kept us on our toes as we meandered around the lake. Boat hire was expensive so wasn't tempted."

One of the best decisions I made for this trip! We had warm weather ( a pleasant surprise for a spring visit:) and the park was a perfect place to enjoy it. There is so much to see and do I'm not sure where to begin. There are an abundance of memorials (including the newest one to Diana) to scope out. The are plenty of signs and maps so you can figure out where you are. The lawns are expansive, the pathways wide and well maintained, lots of gardens and blooms, trees for shade, bikes to rent and nooks and crannies to explore. We spent time exploring and enjoying during our stay. Also made a point of walking thru the park instead of the city sidewalks when venturing else where and the route hit along the park. Highly recommend enjoying this historic London asset when in the city. Hard to tell there is a major city outside the park boundaries when you're inside. Several tube stops get you there."

It is an easy walk from Harrod's, so we brought all our fun food hall purchases here (several bags worth!) for a leisurely picnic. The walk from Harrod's is not far but a little challenging to figure out - from the Knightsbridge tube area, point yourself towards the park (north) and look for the walkways under/between the buildings that line Knightsbridge Rd. (looks like these show up on Google maps, watch the locals too). Through the walkway and across another road and you're at the southern end of Hyde Park, near the Serpentine lake - couldn't ask for a better picnic spot! There is also a playground on this end of the park - we were going to walk up to the Princess Diana playground (technically Kensington Park but connected), but this playground ended up being a place that the kids were quite content to stay at for a while."

This wasn't even on our radar, but we thought \"why not?\" We had some trouble finding this attraction, though it is an enormous city park. We got off at the Notting Hill tube station, then took the bus in the general direction of Hyde Park, not sure where to stop. We got off the bus basically giving up, and the Park happened to be basically right there. We wandered around in the park and happened upon a children's park, then past that some fountains, which were adjacent to a lake with... swans! We followed the lake for a while and found... all the swans! We also found a cafe/restaurant where we ate dinner. On the way out of the park, we found a visitor appearing to be feeding birds. Turns out there are parrots indigenous to the park. He lent us some nuts, and before long we had parrots eating out of our hands. What a wonderful side trip. Highly recommended."

Little I knew that I will end up working and leaving so close to it that I could visit every day!! I still in love with the park and it hearts me when I see people mistreating the plants and animals. It's not very often but it happens. The Park is beautifully well kept. They clean every day, all day! The Park is too busy during weekends. If you would like to enjoy the park, visit early in the morning. It's a beautiful place to go running or for long walks. I just would like people to stop visiting, so I can have it for myself!! he, he. Very selfish I know ;) I just wish every Park in every city would resemblance to Hyde Park. For me is the best Park in the world!"

Apart from being a perfect location to host the numerous concerts and festivals that occur rather frequently, Hyde Park is one of the lesser parks in London. I would advise you walk through if you are in the area, yet, don't visit Kensington purely for it."

There are interesting neighbourhoods and places of interest near Hyde Park. Some years ago, I was lucky enough to be offered a place for free (for 20 days) in Bayswater (5 minutes on foot), so every day, instead of using the subway, I would go to the park and walk to the other side. In any case, if you need to use the subway, there are a couple of stations in the East part (Marble Arch in North-East and Hyde Park Corner in South-East). On the other hand, if you want to take Oxford street, it literally starts in the North-East part of Hyde Park."

Hyde Park itself is great but for a full day of free entertainment...Start at Notting Hill Gate tube and walk 5 minutes east towards Queensway. Before you get to Kensington Gardens turn right down Kensington Park Gardens to see the most magnificent houses in London. Keep going south until you pass Kensington Palace on your left. Turn left by the palace and enter Kensington Gardens. Head straight on (east) until you get to the Broad Walk then head diagonally left until after a minute or so you get to the small round pond which is a lovely place to feed the ducks and watch the world go by. Head back towards Kensington Palace but head towards the north (right hand side). Of course you can visit the palace but if you do not make sure you see the small but magnificent formal sunken garden and consider taking tea in the Orangery (expensive though).If you have young children make a detour north for a 5 minute walk to the amazing adventure playground otherwise head South towards Kensington High Street and when you get towards the end of the Broadwalk turn left (east) and walk along the path which is usually bordered by nice flowers. Keep on going till you get to the Albert Memorial and Albert Hall and then onward till you get to the road that bisects the park. Turn left and after a short distance you will get to the Serpentine Gallery where you may catch an exhibition.If you are feeling fit you can head left to the path along the Serpentine and turn left towards Lancaster Gate and pass the famous statue of Peter Pan before reaching the Italian Gardens with lovely fountains. Continue on the path around the far side of the Serpentine passed the Henry Moore sculpture and when you reach the road again that bisects the park get back up onto it cross it and also the bridge back over the Serpentine and head left along the Serpentine towards the Diana Fountain. Nearby there is also the Serpentine Lido if you fancy a swim. If not continue East until the end of the Serpentine for at least a look at the 1960s Brutalist? architecture of the Serpentine restaurant (it is a bit disappointing but a great place to sit). If you go further around you can also hire a row boat.Head south towards Knightsbridge untl you get to the cinder track where you may be lucky enough to spot some soldiers on horses and then left towards Hyde Park Corner. There are some lovely rose gardens just before you reach HPC.On a Sunday morning you can make a detour North towards Marble Arch to experience Speaker's Corner but not if you are of a religious persuasion and easily offended.Otherwise head under the Subway (Apsley House is REALLY worth a visit) and across the centre of Hyde Park Corner (you can also visit the Arch) as well as see the war memorial nearby. Head into Green Park and wander across on any path you like enjoying the peace and tranquility towards Buckingham Palace (also REALLY worth a visit when open during the summer). Finally head into St James's Park opposite the Palace and wander round the lake. The bridge in the middle is a great place for a photo. The best flower beds are at the far end as well as the Pelicans if you are lucky.You will end up near Horseguards Parade so are within 5 minutes walk of Houses of Parliament, Downing Street, Cabinet War Rooms, The Banqueting House, Trafalgar Square, Westminster Abbey, National Gallery..............."

Saturday 18th July, beautiful sunny day, we were in London to meet some some friends, who were in London from Southport and we're staying in a hotel near Marble Arch.Decided as it was such a lovely sunny day we would do some sightseeing by foot, so our journey commenced in Hyde Park by Marble Arch.The Park looked amazing, the trees in full leaf, of various colours, and the flowers in bloom, really beautiful. The were lots of people enjoying the park, some cycling, rollerblading, sitting on the grass enjoying a picnic or just sunbathing. There were many other activities going on including us just strolling along chatting away and enjoying it all. The park is huge and the pathways very wide, cycle lanes, there is comfortable space for all.Our walk took us past Speakers Corner, there was not activity there apart from people queueing for ice cream and cold drinks at the kiosk, so on we went. Before leaving the park, in to Park Lane at the Sout East corner of the park, we paid a visit to th 7/7 Memorial. This is a memorial to the 52 people that tragically lost their lives when terrorism hit the streets of London, a very dark day in this great city's history.There are 52 columns that are 3,5 metres tall, although there are not names on the pillars, there is one for each person that lost their life at the 4 sites that were attacked on that awful day. It is possible to walk amongst the pillars. There were a number of people there some stood in silence heads bowed, others spoke in whispers while others stroked the pillars. The visit was an emotional experience but was made more so as the floral tributes from the 10 year anniversary service were still on display. We slowly left the memorial and continued on our walk about the sights of London.Realise we only touched the tip of the iceberg in respect to looking at all of this great park. We will certainly be back, to explore and enjoy further. It is amazing that such a place exists in the centre of London and admission if free, so no excuse not to visit."

It's nice to get away from the city noise, but consider spending no longer than 30 minutes in the park and don't go further in - you will be disappointed: there are no flowerbeds, not that many trees, the grass in July was practically nonexistent, there's basically nothing to see inside."

My wife had never been there, so we strolled from the north end (speakers' corner) all the way to the south end on our way to watch the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace. It was a sunny day and she enjoyed the stroll immensely. There is now a place near speakers' corner selling snacks and drinks. The park is dotted with benches. (In the past, someone would charge a couple pence for you to sit, giving you a chit indicating you had paid. I do not know if they still charge for sitting on one of the benches.) They paths are wide and shaded. Everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime."

The bike path basically goes around the entire park and does not go into the main sections of the park. The famous Serpentine is in the middle of the park where you can rent rowing or paddle boats for about 12 Pounds and it is great do it with family. Right next to the Serpentine, there is the Serpentine Kitchen & Bar. The Pizza is great and made to order they have 5 kinds and of course the fish & chips and the tacos are great too! They have breakfast in the morning if you get there early.  Note: You order at the bar and make sure you tell them the table number.

We went to the Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park on Boxing Day, late in the afternoon - lots of rides, mulled cider, wine, beer, meat pies, entertainment. My accompanying teen enjoyed it too. All in all it was a lot of fun for a drizzly dark day. The rest of Hyde Park looks like it would be nice to walk around in warmer weather."

Ebbed up walking all the way round to meet friends so was a good opportunity to see all that was happening. Great place for all age groups as there is something for all to do here. Spent the afternoon here relaxing in the sun at the lido cafe outdoor area. Has an area blocked off in the Serpentine for swimming. The Serpentine cafe does good bbq Angus burgers on the opposite side. Definitely recommend it as a place to chillax and get away from things while being close to transport."

After an initial language barrier with the staff member about allergies, I asked if the flat bread pizza was nut and egg free. I was told they had sold out. I asked about the children's pizza and was told it contained egg (unlikely). So, I asked what was available that was nut and egg free. He said he didn't know - I then encouraged him to ask. He went into the kitchen after 10 seconds came out and said he couldn't serve us anything. Said I should go somewhere else! I asked to speak to the manager and he tried to fob me off. I then demanded to speak to the manager who came out. I was offered a white bread ham sandwich which was nut and egg free. I ordered food for everyone else. My soup came and was told be waitress that she forgot the spoon. She then continued to serve other people - didn't seem to be able to find table numbers. In the end I went to the kitchen to get a spoon. The soup was cold on top and warm at the bottom. Terrible service. A lovely park with a family history, spoilt by people not looking after those with disabilities- it is 2015... its not on. The 5 big allergens must be catered for."

It was all very well organised, and it is situated in a great location, with easy access from Marble Arch station. There were plenty of food stalls (although they were pricey, but that was to be expected) and there were very long queues to use the toilets, but other than that it exceeded all my expectations and we had a really lovely day. Hope to come back another time, either for another concert, or just to sit on the grass/walk around as it is a beautiful park."

There is just so much variety of space in a heavily built up expensive area of London. You can understand why it's so popular because it's a place close by for people to get out of the concrete jungle with loads of traffic and stressed out commuters. On the contrary on a cold or wet day, there is a bit less to do and people are noticably more sparse, but that's just like any park."

Santa Claus is there, then we had the one and only real life MAZE! The best part is it looks invisible as if you can simply walk through but then, bang! You will get whacked by the glass wall! Therefore, you have to use both hands and move carefully before you get hit by the walls! Then in the summer, it's very peaceful and the lake is clear and clean)!

Trees in London are surprisingly healthy despite all the traffic and I guess the planes keep a better balance. There is something regal about Hyde Park,maybe it is the wonderful trees...It is home to many shows and spectacles and concerts and a great meeting place for folk. Great for people watching especially the antics some folk have with their pets. A place which seems to draw large groups of people I've noticed. There are many memorials and pockets of interest both topical and historical.It used to be famous for the speaker's corner, near to other places of interest and tourist attractions it serves as a great plainof greenery and Nature amongst the city sights of our vibrant c Capital city."

It was however not as well organised as The Radio 2 event. There were no signs from stations directing crowds to the event. Our tickets directed us to North Gate but no signs on gate to indicate which gates they were. The Radio 2 event is laid out using the parks pathways to make aisles but this event was not so a constant stream of people walking through the crowds with trays of drinks also very difficult when you are the person carrying the drinksNo food or drink allowed to be taken in. With Radio 2 event we can take a picnic.The bars and food service areas could not cope with the queues and lots of the concert we both spent queuing There were very few stewards. Plastic bottles and plastic glasses with drink in were being thrown in the crown with no one available to stop this.Toilets let not even talk about them but at the other events lots of rows of toilets available.I think our general opinion is that the organisers of this event spent as little money as possible, cutting back on stewards, toilets, signs for crowds to find their way in and out of the event. I suspect they charged food and bar providers a fortune to be on site so crowd could not take in a picnic. We are looking forward to attending Radio 2 again in September but would not recommend the BST event. Also would like to let people who have attended BST and come away disappointed this is not reflective of all events in the park."

But it seemed clean and well kept, and very busy with gig-goers, tourists and locals enjoying the pleasant afternoon (which turned to rain, but this isn't the park's fault!)To anyone thinking of going to a Hyde Park gig, I would absolutely recommend it. I would like to say about this particular gig, that the gate staff were great, and polite (not so on previous occasions). Once in, of course the food and beverage sellers have their captive audience (once you're in, you're in and no going out!) so prices are expensive, but this is to be expected and if you reason that with yourself before you even get there you will have a much better experience. We had a really good lunch, and then a KFC when we got out to save some money! But there were all sorts of foods available, great choice. And the band were simply incredible - as always!"

I enjoyed the vibe I got walking through as it was very nice to see so many people enjoying the park. There are many trails/roads to walk through fields, around tree lines, and along the Serpentine river. Don't forget to find the Peter Pan Statue in Kensington Gardens on the other side of the Serpentine, my 4 year grandson loved seeing the pictures of it as he has seen it featured in a movie."

The main feature of Hyde Park has to be the Serpentine lake with its lido, which strangely changes its name to The Long Water once it goes under the bridge. Other features include the very popular Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. Other features include the Sackler Gallery, and Holocaust Memorial Gardens, and on Sundays Speakers Corner can provide excellent entertainment. There are also places to grab a bite, or go for a more substantial meal. During our visit we were fortunate enough to see a troop of Horse Guards from the nearby barracks exercising their horses on Rotten Row."

About two weeks ago I went to London UK again with a friend. We stayed in a hotel opposite to Hyde park. So on our last day in London we were determined to see what makes Hyde park famous. We definitely fell in love with the beautiful park. It's big and spacious with beautifully cared for gardens. There were lots of wild flowers. In the middle of the park there's a beautiful lake with swans and a variety of birds. There were friendly squirrels up on the trees that actually followed us begging for nuts I guess. Will definitely visit again and this time will bring a picnic basket too!"

Benches to relax and watch life go by and lots of shaded areas along side the sunshine pathways so if you are starting to heat / burn up you can find some protection. Walk past the Diana memorial and head up to Speakers Corner or on to Kensington Palace.

He also caused a scene when the person serving me accidentally gave me the wrong drink. Instead of allowing her to correct it for me easily he stated an exchange could not be made which was of course ridiculous and so I opposed it. I got the correct drink however the man refused to apologise to me. Such insolence set an awkward end to what would have been a nice relaxing final drink of the day.

Great for a picnic. It is so large that you can easily find a quiet spot to sit or sunbathe. We always like parks, and this is one of the best. You can also walk on into Kensington Gardens if you wish. Recommended"

There are vast sections of nothingness that are mind numbing. It seems almost as if the city forgot to provide a plan for each section. There are some nice features scattered (widely) around. I especially liked the newish Diana fountain which is interactive, and the Serpentine art galleries. The huge lawns provide ample space to just sit on some grass. And the Italian Garden is pretty, but not sure what is Italian about it given its naturalistic setting, other than the water fountains. Basically Hyde Park is a 'large green space' that you jog through on the way to somewhere else. Perfect for large outdoor concerts and rallies. It could be so much more,"

With the adjacent Kensington Gardens this provides a huge, attractive green escape from the busy city.My visits are few and far between nowadays but when here I like to sit on one of the plentiful benches on the northern side of the Serpentine. This lake, and its continuation into Kensington Gardens, is not natural but was created from the waters of a now-underground river. When the river became heavily polluted it was diverted away and the lake is now of water taken from deep underground.The area to the south of the lake was the site of the Crystal Palace. This centrepiece of the 1851 Great Exhibition was moved to south London afterwards but sadly lost in a fire nearly a hundred years ago.The eastern boundary is Park Lane with Mayfair beyond. In this part you will find two memorials, to 'Animals In War' (reviewed separately) and to 7/7 victims, of which I'm not allowed to expand on.There is plenty more of interest here including the Marble Arch and Speakers Corner (both reviewed separately) in the north east corner, and a number of interesting statues plus the Queen Elizabeth Gate (reviewed separately) in the south east part, near Apsley House (reviewed separately).The vast 'Winter Wonderland' with fairground attractions, a circus, ferris wheel, seasonal food and produce covers much of the south east in the run up to Christmas and beyond."

The park is so well maintained and the flowers and trees were either in bloom or budding for their summer floral show. It's only when we came to the lake that the real vastness was on show. Also check out the Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain which is certainly worth seeing. One mistake we made was having tea at the Lodge on the entrance to Hyde Park - paper cups, eating pastries out of the bag and service which was a tad surly .... We should have waited until reaching the centre of the park where 2 very decent looking restaurants/caf\u00e9s are located. It is well worth visiting and I will come back to explore further."

We had a nice little walk, watch out for all the cyclists as there are lots but there are some paths that are cyclist free so they're not a major issue and you can borrow bikes yourself if you'd like a little ride around the park. We only got to explore a little of it as its so we'll definitely be returning to have a better look around. We didn't try any of the food places due to bringing our own food but there was a little hut selling food, an ice cream van and a coffee place I believe. We fed the swans in the lake and tried to feed the squirrels but they weren't interested in the food we had. Both sets of animals were very tame and seemed used to being around humans as they all came right up to our hands to check out the food. I watched a woman feeding this one squirrel and he just kept running back to her for more and would take the food straight out of her hand. I'd definitely recommend this place for families or people just looking for a nice spot to relax and talk.Tip: make sure you bring 50p/1 euro in case you need the toilet!"

Lots of wildlife to see such as swans, herons, ducks and squirrels. Safe to bring your children too as cycling is only allowed in restricted areas and dogs are supposed to kept on a leash (although there was one crazy dog not kept on his leash scaring all the birds- I was very unimpressed with the owner the sign blatantly says please keep your dogs on a leash and this owner let his dog run through the water, almost knocking small children over!).Excellent facilities with multiples restaurants and eateries scattered throughout the park. Lots of information boards with facts to read. Toilets cost 20p so I recommend bringing change if you have small children or a weak bladder! Shame it costs money but the toilets were in great condition and very clean with a member of staff on duty."

Another gift from our Royal Family (well snatched from them) making London a designated 'forest' because of the large green footprint of its gardens and squares.This was formerly a royal hunting preserve opened to the public in the early 17th century. In 1851 it was the location of the Great Exhibition, which was held in the newly constructed Crystal Palace, the worlds largest greenhouse-style exhibition hall (1 million square feet) that incorporated many of the park\u2019s trees under its roof; it sadly burned down in 1936 but its outline can still be seen if you know where to look.The Park covers more than 340 acres and is bordered on the east by Mayfair and on the west by Kensington Gardens. To the South are all the best museums in London. This Park truly is the centre of London and encompasses the impressive Royal Albert Hall and Albert memorial on its southern fringesThe park shares a large curved lake with its western neighbour; the part of the lake in Kensington Gardens is known as the Long Water, the Hyde Park part is called the Serpentine. The lake is used for boating in the summer and skating in the winter.In the park\u2019s northeastern corner, near Marble Arch, is Speakers\u2019 Corner, world famous, which has long been a centre of free speech for soapbox orators. for bird lovers there is the Hudson Bird Sanctuary, for musicians a bandstand, for the thirsty a large fountain;for the arty there are two art galleries; for the horsey there are horse parades; for the sporty there are footbal games; there is also a ranger\u2019s lodge, and, in the southeastern corner of the park, the statue of Achilles (1822), which recalls the duke of Wellington\u2019s victories against the FrenchNot far from the statue, and nearly adjoining the park, is the Wellington Museum (1952), which is housed in a structure built in 1778. Nearby starts a celebrated riding track, Rotten Row.The park has several concerts in the summer, and the giant screens are set up for televisual events transmitted from the Royal Opera House or The Royal Albert HallYou cannot say you have visted London if you have not visited this most famous of parks!"

Walking in another direction you can easily get to the shops in Kensington, or walk to Marble Arch and Oxford Street.

Clean and well kept, full of people and dogs running around which always makes it feel homely being greeted by people from all corners of the globe we found this to be really welcoming.Amazing views and Buckingham Palace in the background as the dogs chase each other around was just blissful, many sites of interest including the famous Speakers Corner and the Diana, Princess of Wales memorial opened in 2004.A MUST VISIT!"

Whether its to spend lunch, walk a dog or simply relax for a few hours, the best time to go is (obviously) in the Summer when the weather is lovely. You can easily spend a good few hours sitting in the sun. The park, being in London, is not far from shops if you want to have a picnic or spend your lunch break with a Sainsbury's, Mcdonalds, Tesco and other shops just across the road (from Marble Arch/Oxford Street entrance). The is also a small restaurant overlooking the lake if that takes your fancy as well as small cafes all over the place. Access around the park is relatively easy due to the tube stations dotted about (Hyde Park Corner and Marble Arch are the two main stations served by Piccadilly and Central lines respectively) and there are also free toilets dotted around the park."

You can sit by the large ponds and watch the ducks or walk around looking at London's tall buildings in the distance.It isn't always peaceful! Especially in the summer, Hyde Park hosts some excellent concerts, some even with free entry so look out for those to avoid/join in with depending on what you want to do.Every winter, from late November to early January, Hyde Park is home to a Winter Wonderland, a free entry fair with many rides and attractions including a large ferris wheel, roller coasters, fun houses and the like. Not to be missed!"

It's a mix between a christmas market and a fun fair. There are little huts selling everything christmassy including baubles and ornaments, I was very surprised at how reasonably priced some of the stalls were! There were food and drink stalls, there was a carousel bar. In the funfair part they had things for both children and adults, my favourite was an ice castle. This was a dome full of ice statues (It was freezing!), you had to pay extra but it was a really good experience. I am already planning my next trip to London in December this year so I can go to the Winter Wonderland again!"

Hyde Park Corner or better still Marble Arch are the best tube stations to access the park. South Carriage Row, the long dusty path along the southern edge of the park was once the site of the 1851 Great Exhibition where the original Crystal Palace stood. You really get a sense of how large it was as you walk along. There are a few information panels about it along the way. A more recent historical event is marked near Park Lane. Look out for the memorial to the victims of the London 7/7 bombings."

Search for all 16 fountains, statues monuments including Diana's memorial. Plan a picnic among the old trees or watch all the swans, ducks and geese swim in one of water features. Jog along the old trees at sunrise, take your children run around one of the many playgrounds or relax in the park deck chairs. Plus Kensington Gardens and Palace is right next door.

As someone who has lived close to London for most of her life I have visited Hyde Park many times but never on a Sunday to \"Speakers' Corner\". Recently I was in London overnight from Saturday to Sunday. What an opportunity! So, come 9.00 on Sunday I dragged my husband and my son some distance from Mayfair to Speakers' Corner. People are allowed to speak there - freedom of speech reigns ......or it used to. Perhaps I am living in the past. Years ago there would be someone - or many people - speaking every Sunday. My excitement had mounted only to be dashed. Not one person. Why? Or why not? Are people scared? Do people not go out in the winter? Has a great British attraction died? What a disappointment. It is in the guidebooks - yes, I read them to see what is recommended for visitors. This can no longer be regarded as an attraction in London. That really saddens me. Hyde Park, of course, despite being populated by joggers, remains glorious."

The fountain ebbs and flows like Diana's life itself. The park is a huge expanse of green - not my favorite of the London parks but still quite nice to walk through."

It also contains a small number of restaurants and watercraft to enjoy on a sunny day. It\u2019s wonderful to come here on a nice day and feed the swans and I would recommend bringing a loaf of bread to feed the poultry.

We went with some friends and as it was a weekend, we prebooked a VIP box with Champagne for 4 people at about \u00a3100 total at Cirque Beserk for a 1 hour evening performance. The ticket also gives you fastlane access into the park, which was a bonus as the queue was fairly long. Quite a large Christmas Market and Fair with some great rides, but wherever possible it's worth prebooking online to get the most out of your experience. Once we had sampled a few treats and walked (a lot!) it was time to warm up in the circus tent and enjoy a bit of bubbly before heading home. If like us you are in a small group driving to London, then you might also consider the Park Lane underground car park which borders Hyde Park and is within 5 minutes drive of the A40/M40. This also avoids the Congestion zone and can be prebooked online. On the other hand if you already are in London, as the entrance to Hyde Park and the Wonderland is free, you could enjoy the festive ambiance and live music without spending a penny....but you will be tempted by the Bavarian beers,sausages, pretzels and waffles!"

            "review": "Hyde Park......great place for nearly all seasons!. This as many people probably have already heard is one of the most famous public parks in the world. (As well as probably one of the best in my opinion.)It's often refered to as 'the lungs of London' in many cases, and in just one visit you'll be able to see why.Being very conveniently central and also accessable from several main locations. Is a place where you could actually spend almost a whole day strolling and soaking up the atmosphere (depending on what time of the year you're visiting).The best time I find is usually from late Spring to early Autumn. When like most public parks it's in full bloom and the weather tends to be more reliable.It incorporates numerous attractions including the famous Speakers Corner (nr Marble Arch), the Achilles Monument (nr Hyde Park Corner), the Princess Diana Memorial and Childrens Playground & Serpentine Boating Lake (which was used as one of the venues for the London Olympics).It also connects you to several different areas in the Central Zone such as Knightsbridge/Brompton/Queensway/Notting Hill/ Bayswater & Mayfair, and also adjoins to nearby Kensington Gardens. With the busiest times of the year tending to be early July to late September (can be pretty heaving at times due to a number of open air rock concerts being staged.) Which as you can gather has attracted some of the most famous names past and present. (I also heard that it used to be one of our famous monarchs HENRY VIII's favourite hunting grounds.)At the latter end of the year (from late November to very early January). It has played host over the last few years to the pretty unique Winter Wonderland Experience for the festive season (this is well worth a visit).So if you want a picturesque centrally located attraction that'll give you fond memories for all seasons on your visit to London. Then this one's definitely not to missed off your itinerary."

As day trippers to London, looking to enjoy the best the capital could offer for the festive season, we found ourselves at Hyde Park Winter Winderland. Not really sure what to expect, but in contrast to what we are offered locally, this is a pleasure.Lots of chalets, a mixture of gifts and refreshments, you don't need to indulge to enjoy the experience. As you get further into the 'village' the gift chalets make way for fairground rides, and again, these don't fail to impress, being of a similar scale to those found at most provisional theme parks! Rides are paid for with tokens, purchased at centralised kiosks and seem fairly average in price. There are various paid attractions which we avoided, having only visited to get a feel for it all. A one-way system operates and the security staff try their best to enforce this, however it is busy and therefore people do occasionally ignore it. We visited at lunchtime on Sunday and although it was busy, it was not uncomfortably so, though obviously the number of visitors can increase significantly closer to Christmas."

We attended Zippos Family Circus, went for a ride on the Giant Observation Wheel and visited the Magical Ice Kingdom. All were reasonably good but the circus was excellent. All were quite expensive (information on cost available on www.hydeparkwinterwonderland.com/tickets. There were also a very large number of Bavarian style wooden chalets selling an extensive range of food, drinks and gifts. Additionally, there were fair rides for all. Our visit covered several days and we were pleasantly surprised of how good everything was. Didn't quite meet the standards of other markets visited throughout Europe but certainly beat some and without doubt easily surpassed a number within the UK. The actual entrance to Winter Wonderland is free. Certainly worthy of a visit and recommended as such."

On our last day in London on a short break, we decided to walk through Hyde Park on our way to the train station before returning home. It's a lovely open space right in the heart of London, very close to Oxford Street, Marble Arch, and also Buckingham Palace and Paddington railway station. At the end of Oxford Street, just before you get to Marble Arch there is a wonderful coffee shop serving warm croissants, pain chocolat, and good coffee. There are lots of different places to walk, for dog walking or romantic walks, or just a solitary place to go and lose yourself for a few hours away from it all. On the day we were there, they were setting up for the triathlon event, so there were lots of organisers there and tv crews setting up. But this wasn't intrusive. Our best moment came when we sat down for a short break, saw some grey squirrels who appeared quite friendly and came up to us for a bit of our food, eating out of our hands even.Then my partner said, hey there's a red squirrel. Don't be silly I said, there aren't any left in the UK. But sure enough, there was. And it got really close to us, also eating out of my hand. It can be a little hard working out your way around the park, due to its shear size and the maps are few and far between."

Loved watching the dogs romp and people just sitting.A wonderful contrast to the driven people running to catch a tube!!"

I could walk around the park all day - and have - just people watching. And dog watching. And bird watching. There are monuments around every corner, statues, delightful nooks and crannies. History too is everywhere you look - Marble Arch and Speaker's corner and Rotten Row. Take a day in the middle of your visit to London, take a picnic lunch, go to the park and just BREATHE."

It is free to go in and has rides for all ages, a big wheel, food and drink stalls and a reasonable size Christmas market. It is well thought out and has a very festive feel to it. The Christmas market stalls were very nice and there were sideshows and a large skating rink. The only downside to the event is the prices of the rides which are a bit prohibitive if you are a family. You need multiple tokens for each ride which are \u00a31 each - there is no discount for buying packs of tokens and no wristbands which cover everything which is a shame as there are lots of really good rides but unless you are willing to pay \u00a35 plus per person per ride you cannot have a go on."

If you want to enjoy the park itself, don't worry - it's big enough for you to get away from the noise. The options are numerous: you can walk along The Serpentine (a small lake) or along very straight paths, or wander around quite aimlessly. Be warned - you may lose track of exactly where you are! One of the pleasures of wandering when you don't know the park well is not knowing what you may find. Yesterday I came across the Norwegian War Memorial, a simple stone in thanks for the friendship between Norway and the UK in World War 2. Speakers' Corner is at the North East corner of the park and can be interesting or diverting, depending on who's talking. A visit to London would not be complete without a stroll round Hyde Park."

We also were passed by a couple of mounted police officers which he thought was fantastic. I've not given a higher marking as many of the gates were locked so we couldnt go in the Park itself near any of the monuments etc which might have been my misunderstanding of the website opening times but it certainly isn't clear that you cant get to see the Diana fountain etc after dark.

Until you visit and walk in Hyde Park, you wouldn't think or imagine that there could be such a beautiful serene Park in the heart of London of this massive size. It shows how the City of London has strictly maintain many Parks in London to keep the beauty of the City and if you had limited time visiting London, a walk in Hyde Park has to be a must that you don't want to miss. The Park is very well kept with walking & cycling paths as well as horse riding. there is even the Serpentine Lake for rowing & swimming. There is also a Playground for Kids with sand pits and the usual play things. Great time for the Family to spend a Summer afternoon."

It is a traditional park in many ways, lots of grassy space, trees, walkways, etc. But, as I wound my way through I found monuments, lakes, gardens. Just moments from the busy, main road is the Italian Gardens and fountains. The river is bountiful with bird life. I only saw the park in the early morning, along with the exercising and dog walking public but it will remain in my memory forever."

I don't know how many gardeners are employed to uphold the high level found in Hyde Park, but it shows. The British do know how to keep their gardens and parks.Hyde Park is huge and it will take 20 minutes to cross lengthwise. It actually consists of several parks (much like Central Park in that other big city). Such as the Italian Garden, with its\u2019 lovely sculptures and fountains. And Kensington Gardens, right next to Kensington Palace \u2013 lovely English gardening. To the Princess Diana Memorial Playground, which is where you have to take your kids \u2013 they will love it. And you for taking them there.Hyde Park is probably the best place to go running. For once I did not try this myself, but there were plenty of others who seemed quite happy about running around in there.Throughout the park are several kiosks where you can get things to eat and drink.

Hyde Park which is as central as it gets as far as London is concerned is one of the most well maintained and visited parks in the city - if not the entire country.The closest tube station are Hyde Park and Knightsbridge - both on the Piccadilly line. The park is massive and very beautiful - its a favourite haunt for a number of fitness freaks, nature lovers and the likes. There is a big lake in the middle of the park - called the serpentine and next to it is a rather nice cafe as well. On the serpentine you can feed the ducks or just sit down and relax.There are also some concerts which happen here from time to time - but the locals continue to resist any such events as it means noise pollution and what not for them.During the Xmas/New Year season also pitching tent here are the Winter Wonderland people - which in itself is quite nice experience for the kids - with the circus and the ice ring - and the hoards of other rides and eating stalls that get put up.I would suggest taking a walk in the park on a sunny day or just sit for some time - while you decide where next to head to - also very close is Harrods if you fancied some shopping :-)"

Ideal for walking, jogging, taking your dog for a walk, a meeting with friends, a group picnic or just lying down in the sun.It's also the venue for some big music events and the most recent was the BBC Radio 2 festival concert. We were lucky enough to be among the 50,000 or so crowd and experience some fantastic performances. Gregory Porter, Kacey Musgraves, Chrissie Hynde, Billy Ocean and Bellowhead all very good. Blondie had dynamite energy and the Jeff Lynne's ELO set was absolutely fantastic. I'm still hearing the songs in my head one week on.If you are planning to go to a future one, I'd recommend arriving early as the organisers still can't seem to get people in very efficiently - we arrived around 11.15am and only just got through the entrance at 1pm (the start of the show). But don't wait for a big event to visit - this is a park of which many international cities would be jealous."

Hyde Park has no intimacy..just loads of grass and great big paths, yes it has ducks and you see stupid people feeding squirrels and there is a strange cafe/restaurant where in true British tradition you queue holding a chipped plastic tray to get a cup of tea and a slice of cake,etc,etc and then wander outside trying to find a table that hasn't got a load of dirty plates on it and/or pigeon or bird droppings. If you order hot food I guarantee it will be cold by the time you have found a table and a chair to sit on.Why oh why cant Britain abandon this stupid self service custom? If you want to kick a football about or play some sort of team game then the park comes in useful.But its not for the romantic. Get the Eurostar and go to Paris and walk around the Luxembourg Gardens and you will see what I mean!"

To be fair, I didn't delve much into the park itself; my hotel is right off Lancaster Gate, so I just popped in there and hugged the road until I got to Notting Hill, where I took the tube back (my feet were aching after a long day of sightseeing).It's a nice park, and I didn't see any of the real sights like the palace, gardens, or Serpentine. But the Italian Gardens (right outside Lancaster gate) are lovely and a nice place to sit. There were tons of joggers and also quite a few cyclists.One thing that was different--I barely heard English spoken the entire time I was in the park. Mostly, I heard Arabic. Apparently, Bayswater (the area right north of the park, to the right of Notting Hill I think) has a high Arab population. I saw many women in hijabs (head-covering) and even a few in burkas (full-body and face covering with a slit for the eyes). Nothing wrong with that of course, just found it strange that I heard more Arabic (and Italian, german, etc. from tourists) than I did English. I admit I felt I \"stuck out\" a bit as a blonde American woman, but it was probably more in my head than anything else.However, I went around 5:30 and I definitely felt safe walking around. Plenty of people around as long as you stick to the main paths (I think any city park can get shady fast if you're a solo woman and venture off where there aren't many people). I wouldn't go out of your way for this park (based on my brief experience and what other reviewers have said) but it's nice for a quick stroll if you're in the area."

My husband and I missed Hyde Park on our first trip to London so we made sure to get there this time even though it was late in the day on Friday (about 7pm). It was still light out so we made our way in. Of course, the park is beautiful and I'm sure during an average daytime it's wonderful, but at 7pm this past Friday it looked like a Muslim nation. Given the general tension in the world (against the US), and the fact that I am a Western woman and the park was literally 99% Muslim (ALL the women were wearing burkas), I was extremely uncomfortable. I don't know if this is an evening thing, a Friday thing, or a one-time thing, but it was very unique and I would not recommend it. I did not look around much, but my husband noted many looks of disgust directed our way. A real shame."

The website is http://www.serpentine.org.uk and the officials and marshals were friendly, efficient and kind. The run took us through lots of paths but mostly around Serpentine Lake, which was beautiful with its bridges and trees lining paths around it. The run is unfortunately completely on paved paths. We left a bag with our camera in it inside the fenced area around the bandstand and nothing was stolen. This was a good run other than the paved path and I'm sure you could easily spend an afternoon here. Not necessarily running. Lazing about would be nice.The Hyde Park Corner underground station is a great starting point for the park."

Normally such a rule is to protect the animals from predators or forgetting how to forage, but I don't think passing out a few nuts has any effect.

If you can, visit all of the Royal Parks but if you can't then the Hyde Park kind of sums it all. Though a bit overpriced, the cafe on the lake is wonderful and to dine or munch and drink by the Serpentine Lake mid-day or in the early evening is a pleasure beyond description.If you have the luxury of time, visit it a multiple times at different times of a day and I bet you will discover your magical moments at least once at some point!"

Walk and enjoy the park (with the help of a map if you need it). You can even print the map at home to have it handy, but there are plenty of maps along the walks. My favorites: - Princess Diana's Memorial Walk and the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain \u2013 Amazing design- The flowerbeds- The Serpentine The park is clean, well maintained and the landscaping is very nice. I particularly love the tulips in the Spring. Continue on to the Kensington garden and the palace. The Hyde Park and Kensington gardens are the best green areas in the city."

Hyde Park along with Kensington Gardens is the largest combined green space in London and during the summer, it makes a great location to spend some time outside, away from the chaos of the streets of London. In addition to being able to find plenty of green space where you can sit and enjoy being outside, there are quite a few attractions to enjoy at Hyde Park, including The Long Water and Serpentine Watersheds, which are populated by a wide range of waterfowl. You can also enjoy boating here during the summer if interested. At the north end of The Long is a decent Italian Garden arrangement. There are quite a few interesting monuments and statues to see at and around Hyde Park. These include the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, Peter Pan Statue on the Kensington Garden side of The Long and the nearby, impressive Prince Albert Memorial (Kensington Garden). In the northeast corner of Hyde Park, you can find the very interesting 'Still Water Statue' horse head statue, near the Marble Arch and the famous Speakers Corner. There is a nice collection of War Memorials also found at the southeast corner of Hyde Park for those interested in such attractions. There are a few restaurants and kiosks scattered throughout Hyde Park, plenty of walking paths, park benches and space to have a picnic, lay out and read a book or just enjoy the warm weather of summer. Flower blooms during this time of year also make the park a very nice place to spend time for both residents and visitors to London."

My friend and I both brought seat sticks, as being of a certain age, are not able to stand around for long periods (I have a number of long term conditions also), however, on entry to the venue we were told we could not take them in with us, although we were not given a specific reason as to why. Fortunately a nearby cafe allowed us to us to leave them there. We watched a couple of bands, very good, I was impressed by Faith No More in particular. Lots of other attractions, but generally drinks and food were expensive. Having travelled from the North East, we had also booked Dinner by Heston Blumenthal to make the most of our visit, but on leaving we were told we would not be allowed back in. There were a number of other irate people wanting to leave, but were basically trapped in the park - it was an extremely hot day and to expect people to stay in the park was completely unacceptable. We went to Dinner hoping to blag our way back in afterwards (see seperate review). We were met with very different responses when we went back to Hyde Park; my friend was let straight in, even with her seat stick, and I was not challenged about either my seat stick or bottle of water that I had in my bag and forgotten about. However, when my ticket was scanned, I was told that as I had been out I could not go back in, and was asked to leave. The woman who was dealing with this was extremely officious and stated that the receipt I had proving I had bought the ticket was 'not a proper receipt', and I should contact the company I bought it from. As there was only an hour left to the end of the event I felt this was rather a 'jobsworth' attitude. When we pointed out that at other festivals people were allowed to come and go as they pleased, we were told 'It's not that kind of festival' - whatever that meant. Eventually another usher allowed us to sneak in to catch the end of the show. I have attended music events, gigs etc for over 30 years, and have never experienced such ridiculously ridged rules. What's more is that the following weekend people were allowed to take chairs, seat still is etc in, and were allowed to come and go as pleased. Whoever has organised the event has some very odd ideas about how rock fans behave if they think that we can't be trusted with sticks, water and whatever else they assume we will bring in if we pop out now and again. The festival itself was good but sadly spoilt for me due stupid and illinformed rules and restrictions. I intend to complain about these issues to the organisers, but I don't think any response will encourage my attendance again."

Attractive lakeside restaurants such as the Serpentine Bar and Kitchen provide an opportunity for the visitor to relax over a splendid meal while admiring gentle activities on the lovely Serpentine lake including the attentions of swans and ducks hoping for diners to feed them.

It was our first stop during our 8 week trek through Europe. We stayed at a basement apartment which was OK but didn't have a private bath so we washed our hair in the sink in our room & often took sponge baths because the one public bathroom was always busy-U could only do this if you're a teenager!We visited all the historical and cultural attractions-saw the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace (the guards in uniform didn't blink!) saw the London Bridge (it looked like it was falling down!) and toured the famous London Tower with its many prison cells-you could almost hear the cries of the prisoners as they were being tortured! The guides on all the tours were very informative with a British sense of humor, which we often didn't understand, but we loved the accent!We heard the chiming of the humongous Big Ben near the Cathedral. My favorite meal was fish and chips with beer and vanilla ice cream, which was yellow b/c of the large amount of butter-at that time was in shape. Many pigeons at Trafalgar Square where we rested at the fountain and ate many sandwiches. I wanted to visit Oxford, but we were on a schedule and didn't have time-next time...My sister & her year old son are visiting London this October. I told them to say hello to the Queen and hug baby George! Cheerio!"

My boyfriend and I visited Hyde Park on our trip to London and decided to have a picnic, we were blessed with the beautiful weather which probably emphasised the gorgeousness of the nature. Everyone minds their own business at the park and that was one of the main aspects which I love about London itself. We were able to have a picnic around other people without being disturbed even though there was many people and people playing sport. We were both really happy to see the amount of sport that was being played around the park (football, cycling, rounders etc.) and this made the park more pleasurable. The lake in the middle of the park is very attractive and was lovely to watch the boats that you could hire on there. Police regulate the park often, which made us feel at ease. The bar where you could also eat seemed appealing but was very busy so we couldn't find a seat. We spent the most of 5 hours at the park and didn't even get bored, such a lovely time"

Its such a nice and lovely park where one can easily find a quiet place to indulge in its tranquillity, relax and lay back from the hectic and busy city life.Inside the park, there are well laid walking pavements leading to different parts of the park. While walking on these pavements, one can enjoy the greenery and flora, monument statutes, lakes and simply enjoy watching the passers by or visitors. The air is fresh and after experiencing this, one can feel that time has slowed down.This place is well-known internationally as a place for allowing anyone to criticize the policies, government, politicians or anyone without being \"arrested\" but unfortunately on the day of our visit, we did not manage to see any. We were told that we had came much earlier (Wednesday) and if its Sunday, there will be a big crowded of \"speakers\" here.The park is also near to many amenities such as hotels, restaurants and cafeterias and so you can grab a bite or have a cup of coffee to relax after visiting the park. Madame Tussauds museum is about 12 minutes of walk from the park and following that, there are shopping and entertainment facilities as well.Although one can take the circle line of the tube to reach here (we didn't), we came here taking the city sightseeing bus on a full-day pass with unlimited rides on-and-off.Its a nice and good place to visit and get immersed in its beauty and charm!"

Hyde park combines with Kensington gardens to form a wonderful park with lakes, monuments, horse riding, political soap boxing on a Sunday and even pop festivals - you can easily spend a day in here but a couple of hours would give you a breather from the relentless pace of London town.Take the Circle Line tube (Yellow) or District Line tube (green) to High Street Kensington and turn right out of the station to walk for about 4 minutes along the busy shopping street then cross over to the entrance to Kensington gardens. Near here is Diana's former home Kensington Palace and the poignant memorial to the wonderful lady. Walk on parallel with the busy road on to encounter the Albert Memorial and across the road the Albert Hall music venue - memorials to her dead husband built by the great Empress of the British Empire - Queen Victoria.Turn left here and walk 5 minutes North to find the Serpentine lake and bridge - notice the horse riding sand tracks away to the right as you go, this is where the Queen's horse soldiers practice every morning- (very early) - it's called \"Rotten Row\" guess why!Head North East over the bridge to reach Marble Arch and Speakers Corner after about 15 minutes - the official centre of London. On Sunday mornings you can listen to all manner of political speeches here as people exercise their right to free speech.Turn right and walk down the swanky Park Lane passing famous hotels and car showrooms to reach the other end of the park at Hyde Park Corner and the Hilton hotel. Here is the museum to the famous \"Iron Duke\" Wellington and the awe inspiring memorial to commonwealth soldiers.Just over from here is the Queen's back yard at Buckingham palace but that's another story....If you are worn out by now there is a tube station at Marble Arch and another to the left of the Wellington House on Piccadilly (near the Ritz Hotel)A great day out and FREE WOOOOT"

Serpentine Lake is so pretty with swans galore. And you can rent paddle and rowing boats to traverse the lake. A few caf\u00e9s dot the sidelines of the lake where you can have a snack, glass of wine or coffee while admiring the incredible views. It's easy to spend several hours here---we did!

The memorial is large flat circular water feature, which is like small water rapids , so the water flows down to one point and is pumped back up again. Many people did not respect this memorial and follow the signs asking people not to climb over the memorial.

Food was also quite expensive, but not ridiculously so. There were so many options: hog roast, pulled pork, pizza, chips, burger, Japanese food, Chinese food, noodles, fudge.... Make sure you have a look around before you decide on something. I would recommend slow roasted lamb :) It came in a burger bap and was served with ketchup and mayo.The acoustics were great; there were speakers everywhere and a couple of screens further back for those who weren't right at the front. As short people, my friend and I stood further back so that we could see the stage over taller people's heads but could also see the screen for a close up. It was much more relaxed that little bit further back. Lots of people brought blankets with them, and positioned themselves on the pieces of grass out of the way of the main stage to drink. Some people had brought a massive picnic too, which I'm sure saved them some money, however, you're not allowed to bring in any liquid. You are allowed to bring in empty bottles and there are lots of water filling stations positioned around the event area.Tickets fro general admission weren't very expensive. We saw Backstreet Boys, McBusted, and other less important acts for \u00a325. Some were able to get even cheaper tickets!For posh bods, there was a covered seating area with a decent view of the main stage."

I went to the British Summer Time Festival on July 4th 2014 to see Black Sabbath, Soundgarden, Faith No More, Motorhead and Soulfly but spent time in the park before the gates opened. Around the Serpentine is always pretty good. There are many places to get drinks and ice creams particularly important at this time of year. Fairly easy walk from Victoria (which I recommend in the Summer) also easy to access from Marble Arch, Green Park and Hyde Park Corner London Underground Stations. Hyde Park is a perfect place to relax after shopping down the road in Knightsbridge!!!"

            "review": "Terrific In-City Park. In short: Bicycles, boats, shoreline seating, ice cream, and adjacency to both other large green spaces and a number of good tourist sites. As far as a park inside of a large metropolitan area, it's hard for me to know what would be better than this!Hyde Park is a mostly flat grassy area of some 350 acres dotted with trees and some minor slopes or hills. I believe when coupled with Kensington Gardens, a green area to the west and directly attached of Hyde Park, it makes up the largest contiguous green space in London, but it is still smaller than New York's Central Park (Kensington and Hyde Park are around 625 acres combined versus Central Park at 843 acres). I only draw the comparison since I believe Central Park is a generally good benchmark for a beautiful city park.However, size isn't everything, and Hyde Park is nice for the number and arrangement of walking paths, and the different monuments and memorials scattered throughout. The pricing of the rowboats or paddleboats is reasonable and splashing around the Serpentine, the pond in the center of Hyde Park, is nice for the time given. The rowing area is large enough to give you an area to get around in and keep clear of the other seafarers. Additionally, the whole space is quite bicycle friendly in terms of paths, pedestrian etiquette, and access to rental bikes.Bicycle rental is best accommodated with use of the Barclay Cycle Hire stations located at several points along the perimeter of the park. The Barclay Bikes, AKA Boris Bikes by the locals, are heavy 3 geared machines, but they're sturdy, the chains are safe from pant legs, and they can shift gears at a stop unlike standard gearing systems used a bike, making them very friendly to casual and pick up cyclists. In addition to being great for riding around the parks, the bikes can be taken to various other sites in the city as any Barclay Bike can be picked up or returned at any Barclay Bike station using only a credit card; I believe a chip credit card is necessary but it doesn't have to be a chip and pin card, unlike many other automated kiosks.However, there is still more to do in and around Hyde Park aside from a wonderful walk, a romantic boat ride, and a breezy cycling jaunt. Within Hyde Park itself is the famous Speakers Corner, a place for public oration and an okay site to see as a tourist since you're already nearby, but even better is the proximity to the historic Kensington Palace in Kensington Gardens and Buckingham Palace next to the Green Park to the east of Hyde Park. Both are worth tourist sites and provide great sightseeing opportunities.All of this adds up to a very strong 4 out of 5 rating, but Hyde Park has a few extra nearby sites that bring this park up to a solid five for sight seers. To the south of the park are the Natural History and Science museums, as well as the iconic Harrods department store if you are inclined to shop. To the east is the Hard Rock Cafe which I didn't visit, but if you like checking them out, it's definitely conveniently situated. The west of the park is, of course, Kensington, which contains a good variety of shops and restaurants; I stayed in that area on my last visit and I did not find myself wanting for anything while there.Adding up the standard but quality amenities, the niceness of the grounds themselves, and the great location within London, this park is easily the base for a whole day of activities. That makes it a top notch recommendation in my books!"

It is a vast park and I know we didn't even see the half of it, but what we did see was lovely. There are formal areas like the Italian Pool and then other areas with wild blackberry bushes and natural grasses. If you happen to walk past the Henry Moore Arch Sculpture you can see all the way to Kensington Palace in the distance, but also be sure to look for the bunnies frolicking in the grass around the sculpture. The area is enclosed by a fence and the bunnies have figured out that off-leash dogs are not a threat to them there. Near the Peter Pan statue we saw a duck sitting on a nest in the lake - and we saw cygnets (young swans) swimming around under the protective eye of their parents. Of course there are lots of people strolling, riding horses, playing soccer, walking their dogs, etc, but you can easily find areas that are quiet and secluded to read or take an impromptu nap. My only wish is that there were a few more restrooms available. We found one eventually near the restaurant by the boathouses. Walking across the park can take 20-30 minutes; to circumnavigate the park you'd probably need an hour and a half - so allow yourself plenty of time to wander and enjoy."

The park enjoys plenty of runners and the Boris bikes are ideal for getting about as is the liberty bus.We have skirted Kensington Palace, enjoyed the Italianette Gardens, Peter Pan's statue and most of the others, visited the Princess of Wales fountain and walked right around the boating lake at the serpentine. Great to see lots of pedalos out in the current hot spell. Huge variety of birds, plants and trees - wild meadow also maintained. Fantastic close up views of the commanding Albert Memorial looking toward his beautiful concert hallThere are plenty of good quality refreshment areas but if you are on a budget you can take your own lunch.Just so much to see and do and far too much to list - simply just go and visit it for yourself rather than just pass it by.

Take a break, walk leisurely through the park, stroll reverently through the Lady Diana Memorial and Fountain, and reflect on yourself and how lucky you just might be to be in London, while others before us are gone.While in February we had no flowers in bloom, but the beauty of the park still comes through. The lake, the paths, the memorial fountain all speak serenity. Enjoy them because they speak volumes of how the British honor their own. The story behind the Lady Diana Fountain is fascinating how it starts calm, then grows more turbulent, very turbulent then calm again, as it describes her life. What a tribute. Rest in Peace Diana.We can't wait to get back during the Spring when all is in bloom and spend time just taking it all in again."

There are hire bikes there and for a few pounds its worth riding the park. As a suggestion start from the Mable Arch area as this will make the bulk of the ride downhill. The downside is you won't easily be able to leave the bike to visit some attractions but you can certainly enjoy some pleasant exercise. There is also restrictions on where you can ride but you are able to \"walk\" the bike anywhere.Its a pleasant and pretty park for an morning/afternoon outing and there are pleasant of vendors if you don't bring your own. An alternative is to purchase a lunch pack from the supermarket chains, take a blanket and combine the exercise with a \"picnic\" lunch.All is all a worthwhile place on a nice day"

We took a very large walk around the park in order to find the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain (took a bit of finding, but perhaps we werent the best at directions in this case). Felt very privilidged to go and stand near the fountain and take some snaps of the beautiful roses in the surrounding gardens. We saw people doing horse riding through the grounds, and on our first day in London, BBCs Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park was on so we got to enjoy the sounds of James Blunt and Jack Johnson for free among many others. (Our hotel was also right near the entrance to the park so we could hear the concert continuing on when we got back to our room which was great). on our final day we saw a marathon that was being run to benefit Teenage Cancer Trust and Great Ormond Street amongst others. It was a great atmosphere. Would be lovely to sit and read if you ever meed a relaxing place to go."

Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace abut the Park. We were walking through the Park and saw signs of the Princess Di Memorial Fountain, so we decided to see it. I was disappointed at first, as it is not a fountain, but a shallow, continuous, circular water course, with various angles of concrete to form the course. However, the more we sat there (with our feet in the fountain, of course), the more we realized that this is a wonderful attraction for families with young children. Grass all around and on the interior of the continuous course; perfect for picnicing. Water no more than 5\" deep; ideal for children to play in. The continous concrete is a draw to kids to walk the entire course. Very engaging. I think Princess Di would be happy that this attracts families with young children. Enticing!"

This park is huge, especially if you add in the Kensington Gardens, which backs onto Hyde Park and is separated by the Serpentine Lake, but is really one big park. There are a few monuments here, like the large statute of Achilles. You can also rent boats for a paddle on the Serpentine. It is not so much a destination in itself, but a nice place to relax, take a stroll or eat a picnic on a nice day. It borders the swanky neighbourhood of Mayfair and leads onto the ritzy shopping area along Oxford Street starting at the Marble Arch. If you are here, take a wonder over to see Kensington Palace, the childhood home of Queen Victoria, but probably better know these days as the post-divorce home of Princess Diana."

The expanse of greenery and water are inspiring.I usually do a walk, or two, through the park, and did so this time, as well.We were just before the peak of the Spring flowers, and the weather was doing its best to wash, or blow away what was there. It does appear that there are many new plantings around the park, and especially near Park Lane. Those appear to be mostly trees, and not annuals. This replanting was probably the only thing (other than the season and weather) that \ufeffdiminished my enjoyment.One has many venues in, and immediately adjacent to Hyde Park, and several full days could be devoted to experiencing it all. On this trip, I just walked and walked, and enjoyed the variety of sights."

As nearly everyone has pointed out, this is a beautiful example of what a park should be, ie; it is well kept & maintained, the park trails go everywhere, the Princess Diana Memorial Foutain, the Prince Albert Hall, and at the western end is Kensington Palace where Diana once lived and at the eastern end, is Park Lane, where you can walk down to Buckingham Palace.This is absolutely a \"must see\" if you are ever in London, and on the weekends when the weather is nice, the kids are out in the Park, roller blading or roller skating to music, and there are some incredible skaters that can be seen there!Make no mistake, this is a huge park, and end-to-end is quite a hike, so if you are not prepared for a serious walk, do not attempt to walk to the far end ! There are a few shops along Bayswater Road (on the far north side of the Park) where you can find a cold drink on a hot day.Speaker's Corner is in the North-East corner of Hyde Park, where people have been coming to announce the end of the world for many years, but on a weekend, it is interesting to wander by and hear them go on about their pet peeves!If you are a walking family like we are, it is a nice stroll from Hyde Park back to the river, where you can see Big Ben and the Parliament Building. If you are not a fan of walking, there are London Tube stations at Knightsbridge and Hyde Park Corner, where you can reach any point in London. Buses traverse Kensington Road as well."

This is a beautiful spot in Hyde park since there's the lake and a cafe which is decently stocked. Though officially you're not allowed to feed the ducks but that's the only reason why scores of parents and children come their in the first place. They also have boating here so in case you're interestedI live in manhattan , ny and we have Central Park to boast of but I should admit that Hyde park has much better amenities and is really well maintained .Every 200 meters or so you have a small cafe with water and beverages and the public toilets are nicely spread out throughout the park ( something which Central Park need to learn)There's a speakers corner which is the best place for frustrated individuals to vent their energy. But I wouldn't care about it much , not a good spot for children. There's the princess Diana park which is really fun for the kids with a real looking sailing ship parked in a whole lot of sand. It's the best for over active boys like ours.They also have royal gun salutes on different occasions throughout the year but you should check the parks calendar for that.

Also famous here is the Speaker's Corner, close to the Marble Arch.Before, the Hyde Park was one entity with Kensington Gardens included within, but in 1728 has been technically separated from the Kensington area of the huge park.In total its overall area is 253 hectares.In the center of the Hyde Park stretches from the northwest to the southeast, the Long Water, a peaked pond.Beside the other events, that are held here in Park, we can also witness to the great Rock Festivals, Concerts, as were in the past the concert of the Rollingstones and Pink Floyd.I walked in the Park, especially enjoying the sight of the swans and ducks in the rippled water of the ponds and also the squirrels, swiftly running across the accurate maintained green lawns among the old trees, as sycamore, oak, birch and beech trees."

It is so beautiful with the flowers and green grass. My son loved the ducks and swans in the water. The park is bigger than expected. We even enjoyed just watching people roller blade in and out of cones in impressive ways."

It offers something for all ages from good children's playgrounds to a \"senior playgrounf\" on the south side which encourages those over 50, though open to those over 15, to try a range of outdoor fitness equipment, and nearby there are bowls and mini golf. Hyde Park has a range of wildlife, herons, cormorants, swans, blackbirds and squirrels and is also a great place to exercise a dog. There are interesting trees and both wild and garden flowers. The Serpentine is good for boating, and if you are intrepid , for swimming. Hyde Park hosts various paying and free events throughout the year including concerts. Worth visiting on a Sunday is Speakers Corner , where anyone can stand up on a soapbox and declaim their political, religious or other beliefs."

It can be the breather you need, in between the hectic pace of life in the streets surrounding the park. We saw people feeding the swans at Serpentine Lake, squirrels and absolutely exquisite flower gardens. Even the stereotypical Englishman soaking up the sun with his shirt off, made an appearance. We were lucky enough to see the Horse guards ride by - alongside Rotten Row, but the one thing I wouldn't bother with again was 'Speakers Corner'. Much has been made of this in years gone by - but it was much overrated and gave me an uncomfortable feeling. During the few minutes we were there, I heard someone else mention that most of the 'Speakers' seemed to perhaps have a mental health issue. It did seem that way on the day we were there - wouldn't recommend it.Would definitely go to see the flower beds again - in the corner nearest Wellington Arch. Just beautiful......And the buildings the toilets are in are so cute!"

The park alone has fountains, statues and gardens to see but also there is the Princess Diana Memorial; The Albert Memorial; The Serpentine Art Gallery; and Kensington Palace. Potentially you could spend an afternoon or even a day just wondering the park.There are many ways to get to Hyde; there are no less then seven underground stations dotted around the sides of the park and buses pass by it frequently. If you are feeling adventurous, as we did, why not visit it on the Barclay Bikes and then use them to travel around the park at leisure? It would certainly fit in with the theme of the outdoors."

It is romantic and calming, where you can go and not be bashed into by a bike or kids on roller skates. The loos are really close and there is somewhere to by an over priced drink! My other favourite place is the Serpentine, loads of choice to buy over priced drinks and food, and make sure you take cash for the smaller snacks venue. You can also get a pedalo!

Hyde Park is one of the largest parks in London and a nice place to spend time if you want to get off the main streets and find some peace and quiet. It is connected to the Kensington Gardens, which rest on the west side of the Serpentine and The Long Water, while Hyde Park can be found on the east and northeast side of these waters. Collectively, the two occupy 253 hectares (625 acres) of space in the heart of the city. Originally the property of Westminster Abbey, these grounds were acquired by Henry VIII in 1536 and were used as private hunting grounds for the Royals until Charles I opened the park to the general public a century later in 1637. Hyde Park was also the site of the Great Exhibition of 1851. During the summer, Hyde Park is a very nice place to visit. The kiosks and cafes are open, the Serpentine populated with leisurely boat riders and birdlife and many people enjoying this vast expanse of green space, a true escape from city life. Winter visits offer a similar experience. The green and lively environment are replaced with solitude, reduced crowds and opportunity for more quiet time, again providing an escape from the fast pace and occasional chaos of the city. We've always liked Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, preferring these grounds over Regent's Park, St. James Park and Green Park. Perhaps it is the presence of the Serpentine Lake or the vast scale of these contiguous parks, but they have long been our favourite in London."

The Serpentine Gallery and the recently opened Serpentine Sackler Gallery (designed by acclaimed iraqian born architect Zaha Hadid), situated on both sides of the Serpentine (river or lake, again), always bring something new and instigating, with free admission, at beautiful Kensington Gardens The Speaker's Corner is another London tradition.

For example if you are staying at South Kensington you can cut across the park and be at Oxford Street in 20-30 mins. Usually faster than the bus."

It was a very cold and rainy day, but the park was full of people and dogs. So many walking trails and some beautiful scenery. It's a fantastic oasis for the entire family. The second time we took our children to the Winter Wonderland. We left the carnival later in the evening in the dark - and had nothing to worry about. The paths were well-lit and people were everywhere. What a nice thing to have in your city. One word of warning: it's HUGE. Much bigger than you think! :)"

There is usually lots going on in Hyde Park throughout the year so check the Royal Parks website before going (http://www.royalparks.org.uk/), events include mini marathons, Winter wonderland - which is a great place to visit during late November, December and early January, and other memorial events.

You actually can cross into both places without any true border separating either one. There is the famous Peter Pan statue that was made famous by JM Barrie who was the author of the story of \"Peter Pan.\" It is located close to the location where the story took place when Peter took the boys out for the night. The Diana Memorial Fountain is also another nice place to stop. You can walk around the fountain that is made of granite with water flowing down in a circular pattern. There were people wading in the fountain as well. Guess they allow this in London. A great quite place to contemplate and enjoy the surroundings. Good to visit if you want a break from the busy, bustling part of London."

Nice to have a girl Singing / playing the guitar too.The mulled wine was lovely and the churros with melted white chocolate on were better than some I've had in Spain. I even found it funny that the 2 young women who were serving in the hit next to the Christmas rollercoaster were unintentionally hilarious in their utterly miserable service provision! My Husband was a bit alarmed when on sitting in one of the rollercoaster cars, it quickly became evident that he was too big for the seat. Realising the safety bar wouldn't go down adequately and his knees were almost under his chin, he indicated this to the ride attendant who responded with 'if you die, you die' before putting his thumb up and off he was sent to ride....

Let's just say that the guide books didn't accurately portray the size of the park. We were already exhausted from having gone to visit the State Rooms at Buckingham and then walking from there to the park, so we were not up for a giant hike. The map we were looking at was not accurate, and we thought Kensington was about a mile from the entrance we used to the park. It was more like 3-4 miles. By the time we got to Kensington, we were so tired that we did not enjoy the palace at all, and did not even go through the gardens as planned. Either go to the park well-rested, or take your time and spend a day there. Or maybe even rent one of the bikes. Do NOT go there after another attraction."

The whole place is very festive with lights everywhere and little wooden chalets. There is lots to see and do and eat. One downside is that it is absolutely packed with people \u2013 it\u2019s almost overwhelming. We were there from about 5:30PM until 8:00PM \u2013 on our way out, there was a huge line up outside of the park. Admission is free, but I guess there were so many people that they had to limit the number of people allowed to enter at a time (so go early!). There is a huge amusement park as part of the winter wonderland \u2013 we didn\u2019t go on any rides but had fun wandering around.The market is great, but you can tell it\u2019s not very authentic. Most of the food stalls advertise \u201cBelgian Waffles\u201d or \u201cGerman Sausage\u201d, etc. \u2013 since we were going to be in both Belgium and Germany within the next week, we thought we would hold off on trying some of the foods until we\u2019re actually in the right country! The same went for a lot of the items for sale \u2013 you could tell that most (not all!) were knockoffs and made in other places. Still, it was a fun experience!Our food recommendation is the \u201cmini donuts\u201d. If you go in through the main entrance of the market and walk all the way down, there will be a little food centre with a lot of pretty lights and a bunch of food stalls in a circle. One of these sells \u201cmini donuts\u201d, which really are just little pastry puffs with nutella and icing sugar \u2013 they were absolutely delicious and very original!

He slowly counted out our money and handed me over the tickets and he managed to do all that without looking or speaking to me the whole time! How Rude. My daughter wanted to go on the bobbing Reindeer ride and a rude lady shouted at my daughter \"COME!\" She's 4 for god sake!! We had paid to see the Magical Ice Kingdom, I stupidly expected to see lovely wonderful magical things but was surprised to see witches, trolls, a grim reaper and some very garish ice sculpts including stocks??, all I can say is strange...... oh and unless you want to go on the slide which you have to pull yourself down, then lets say you'll be done in about 5 minutes. We went for something to eat in the Bavarian food hall. We ordered sausage rolls chips and tea. The tea was vile, no exaggeration, the sausage was over cooked and dry and our chips were raw! We took the chips back and a rude lady threw the same chips back in the fryer with other chips and handed them back. I told her that I did not want them back and she asked \"Do you want a refund\"? Of course I replied. She handed me back my \u00a39.00 and then took the same chips back and threw them in the fryer again?!!?!???! At no point did she appologise. To top our day off, we then managed to walk straight into a muslim march in their hundreds, my children were terrified!! I have to admit I couldn't wait to get out of there too!

It looks great,especially after dark,but is often overcrowded to the point of being hazardous.Underfoot is plastic walkway,and HUGE effort has no doubt been expended on this.Ditto the ride theming,I'm a fairground fan and I can assure you that most of then don't normally look like this!Cost of rides is a combo of the expense of visiting foreign attractions(but where else would you see them-and looking costs zip) retheming and the astronomical rents that are expected no doubt by the organizers!!!Bars are about on a par for london prices,but food trawls new lows for price/quality,and generally I'm afraid customer service.Avoid sweet stalls selling pick'n'mix at about 8x normal cost.So,eat b4 you go,take snacks,try to avoid w'ends,set a limit on rides and be cagey when you go on-ww express is great,kids love it and the showman has a great \"feel\"for pleasing his public-got a 6 MINUTE ride because there was no queue-and no,he's Dutch I think,so I don't work for him:)!"

Visiting Winter Wonderland was a fun day out. I had pre booked tickets online for the magical ice kingdom. The ice sculptures in the ice kingdom were beautiful. I had a professional photo taken on the ice sleigh. The ice kingdom is a sub-zero experience, to give an Arctic atmosphere; you therefore need to wrap up warm. There are many interesting market stalls selling sweets, cutlery, German snacks, Winter wear and Christmas gifts. There are lots of chips, burger, hotdog and drink stalls.There are many fun rides there and an ice skating rink. You could easily spend over \u00a3100 on a day trip here. Make sure you bring cash with you as the portable cash points do charge for withdrawal. People were also taking kids to the circus there. I spent 2 hours here. Winter Wonderland is well worth a visit!"

If you want somewhere to go during the festive period to really enhance your Christmas and give you that warm feeling that only comes this time of year, then look no further. The rides and attractions make this venue a fun-filled day/night out for those of all ages. If you don't care much for the roller coasters, drop rides and fun houses, you can take time out to have a warm hot chocolate/mulled wine whilst watching the ice skaters (or take part in the ice skating yourself, as we did!). I highly recommend going and giving this place a look, whether it's you and your partner, family or small children, nobody will leave feeling as if something was missing. In short, Winter Wonderland encapsulates all things Christmas for you to experience at your leisure!"

Another favourite were the stocks made out of ice which you could put your head and arms in! At the end we got to go down an ice slide however we had to queue. Be warned though it is very cold in there so wrap up warm. For lunch we had Bratwurst in the Bavarian Village which was tasty and we had hot chocolate and two different flavours of churros, icing sugar and cinnamon sugar available to buy from a stall. There are also other goodies to buy including chocolate and toffee apples, fresh pretzels and pick n mix sweets. The stalls are really nice to look at and buy from and the atmosphere is amazing.

I didn't go on any of the rides but it was nice to see them, especially with it all lit up so well at night time - which is definitely the time I'd recommend to go! It does get busy but it's quite big and in some places somewhat spaced out, and there's plenty of areas to sit and relax, including some stages with acts and bands performing which really made the night.

I travelled with hubby and 3 young adults.The German village was particularly full of atmosphere with lots of things to see and do. The weather was very kind to us, however we were very grateful for the numerous places to sit and relax, where you can start to feel a little warm again! We were most nervous about the ice skating, but have to say this was the highlight for us all and so much fun, and probably the best value activity.I can understand the comments about it being pricey, especially if you are responsible to purchasing all refreshments, but plan ahead and take in all your left over goodies for munching on over a wonderful hot chocolate or a beer! We also went on the wheel, which was fun and interesting, the Ice Kingdom was not particularly brilliant and certainly not worth the entrance fee (can't remember what we paid, but any entrance fee, to me, was too much - very underwhelmed!).The place was kept nice and clean and tidy through the day, there were plentiful toilets, also kept clean - unlike when you come to Hyde Park for a concert!We also watched the cirque berserk, which was really good and finished off our day perfectly. All in all a very nice Christmassy event, which we all enjoyed."

Lots of fair rides for kids of all ages, which cost not much more than at any other fair, but lots of choice so agree with the comment of giving the kids a set amount of money or it could be expensive.

Brought my daughter down to london hyde park winter wonderland as a treat before christmas, very magical and enjoyed the experience.....but.....certainly overpriced......you need to make sure that you arrive with a full wallet and be aware it will be empty by the time you leave, rides are priced between 5 and \u00a38 per person. Thoroughly enjoyed the weekend but the prices took the edge of a bit."

This is the 3rd year running at the land of overpriced and expense. But something magical for the kids to remember. Food or drinks is not by any means a cheap affair \u00a34 for a bag of roasted chestnuts that you can get at the market for \u00a31.50. The first year a relative purchased a bag of popcorn for \u00a35, yes that\u2019s \u00a35. This year purchased them a large bag before hand in Tesco\u2019s for \u00a31.29. Left the booking of the Ice Kingdom and Ice Skating to the last minute (48 hours before) they were sold out. However, a member of the family went into the Ice Kingdom and was overwhelmed by the great ice sculptures, it does say -8 on the site but advised got too cold for the children. The rides are \u00a34-\u00a36 and is expensive depending on how many children you have in tow. It would be better to have a one payment for all the rides and the rides owners split the pot. The atmosphere is always enjoyable the decorations and lights are pretty. There is an array of food, drinks and sweets. There are some stalls selling candles, jumpers, hats, handmade jewellery, sweets, e.t.c. There is a lot of places selling large German sausages but they is other selections but would be nice if a stall sold a Christmas roast.There was a large beer tent and it had a stage, live music and lots of German beer from a beer stein priced at \u00a39. Maybe it\u2019s not suitable for the children but groups of adults were certainly enjoying themselves.The walk leaving the park felt much longer then arriving, but then again did walk to Hamleys. Arrived at Marble Arch station and walked down took about 20-25 minutes.Will properly visit again before it closes on the 5th January 2014, always worth the visit.The toilets were very impressive and really clean and warm."

Decided on this as lapland uk was not affordable for us and it was free to enter. prebooked 3 for ice skating, 5 for ice kingdom/wheel at just iver \u00a3100.We went on Saturday 7th December. Fantastic weather so that helped!Arrived at marble arch at around 9.30am. Busy but not hectic (yet!) There was a big queue but not unexpected. We were lucky to have a booking for 11am for ice skating so we were allowed in a shorter queue. Got access by 10 to 10 and got a lovely personalised china tree decoration for \u00a310 with all our names on it. We also bought some ride tickets for later.christmas music playing loudly all day and we loved it! Toilets were scattered around in many places and at this point in the day no queuing! Ice skating was amazing. Good quality skates and a magical rink! Didn't do the whole hour but very enjoyable. Did a couple of ride with no queuing and then had lunch. We all had \"gourmet\" burgers (beef, chicken or ostrich) which cost \u00a325 for 5 of us. We thought this was reasonable in Lndon for the quality and taste of the burgers. Youngest had a helter skelter slide for \u00a33 (3 tickets) but needed my husband to accompany him as he is only 3. We had to pay another \u00a33 for him even though they used one mat and shared the ride which was a lot! However he loved it but it would of been better for him to be able to have 2 rides for that price! We had pre booked the ice kingdom so headed that way and did a couple more rides en route. The maze/crazy house was brilliant and excellent value at \u00a34 each. It lasted a while and was so much fun. Would have liked to go on the ride next to the magical kingdom but it was \u00a37 each (\u00a335) for us all and the queue was horrific so opted out . Would have liked the opportunity to pre book this ride. Magical ice kingdom was lovely. The ice sculptures were brilliant and the castle amazing. It inspired us to google how it was made! Really need more information on entering though as was confusing......there was a queue for an iceslide at the top but no info about it. Most pele followed the queue out. A few too many people were let in at the same time so this marred the experience a little. The queue to get out by the slide lasted just over half an hour. So we spent almost an hour in -8degrees temperatures. The slide was manned by a disinterested and bored teen. There were people sticking coins on the ice which seemed very sad. Although it looked cool to see so many stuck to ice we were shocked that it was being allowed to happen. We bought hot chocolates when we came out as they had sold out inside. There was a huge difference in cost on stalls. Our cost \u00a32.50 each with no cream or flake and resembled chocolate coloured water. Round the corner galaxy hot chops were only \u00a32 each but they served the purpose of warming us up! It had got lots busier now and the ladies toilets were rammed. poop kiddies and pregnent ladies were crossing their legs or risking the wrath of anxious queing people to push in! We then had a horrendous queue for the wheel. Having pre booked we were shocked that we had to queue for an hour. It was only worth the queuing because we ended up on the wheel as the sun was setting. It was so pretty. However on reaching the top we could see how busy it had become. The place was scarringly rammed and to top it off there was a queue to marble arch around 8 people wide to get in! We decided being near to the exit that we would leave and eat at the train station. We were lucky we had access to a cab to Liverpool street or it could have been stressful! All in all we had such a lovely family time. So glad we pre booked as and when we did. And pleased we left when we did too! Would go back but may be not a weekend or just for a morning before shopping in Oxford Street. Very Christmassy enjoyable event but crowd control/security poor. Total cost for a family of 5 including train/underground, lunch, dinner, rides and keepsake/treats \u00a3250"

Having read the positive reviews on here I decided to take my children along to Winter Wonderland - wish I hadn't bothered, it was horrific.After a 4 hour journey we viewed the website which advised that families with small children should alight at Green Park and walk over. Whoever advised this should be given the firing squad, the walk took over 45 minutes and had my poor youngest struggling for breath. When we arrived it just went downhill....The initial walk is an array of stalls selling overpriced tat or food, but very few have even small seating areas for your little ones to have a rest and a bite to eat. Some stalls do but only the other side of the Bavarian Bar. With no real eating options for kids we ended up spending over \u00a320 on giant hot dogs for 2 adults and 3 small children. A complete rip off.The ice kingdom and circus are to be fair about the only things that aren't ludicrously overpriced, but before you get to them you are greeted by hoards of rickety old fairground rides that cost between \u00a33 and \u00a34 and last around 90 seconds. The final straw was queuing to see Santa, and him buggering off home without an explanation leaving us and only us left in the queue.The place is tacky, overpriced and about as festive as toilet paper. Avoid like the plague."

I always try to book a room close to hyde park so I can go running in the morning. The park is a wonderful asset to the city and elevates london above cities like paris where one has to walk for an hour or so to see any greenery. The best way to see the park is to start near the Italian gardens, then around round pond and then back around the river and past the old police house. If its your first time to London, give it a try!"

I took my two sons (13 & 11) on Monday and was expecting queues and hordes of people so was relieved when we arrived late morning and there was nothing of the sort.

Vouchers had to be puchased for the rides, no wait time, not one queue but \u00a320 did not last long at \u00a34-6 per person per ride. Good choice of food however a pork and crackling roll was \u00a36.50 and a soft drink \u00a32. We didn't book any of the special attractions as we'd done similar in the past. Yes it was expensive but we had read other reviews so were prepared.

It's free to get into and then lots of stuff to spend your money on if you so choose. I would have loved to have taken my children there when they were younger. The singing snowman, the pirate and the Alpine hotel provided free amusement for small childrenThe food was disappointing and lacking variety. London now has an expanding market for good street food so no excuse for that. None of the food seemed to cater for children. I would advise any family to take in food for the children (if on holiday Boots lunch deals are cheap and easy and good and many other stores do similar deals). I'd then budget for about 4-5 rides (apparently \u00a33 for adults, \u00a32 for children). That would make a really cheap Christmas treat. I had a German sausage in a roll for \u00a34.50- not bad. Tiny chips for \u00a32.50-ripoff. Some of the food stalls seemed overpriced. Most were incredibly dull. I would recommend this for families as part of a day out. Go from there to Oxford Street. I would like to have said go and see Selfridge's magical Christmas windows but my inner child was very let down since today the magic of Christmas as I remembered it had been replaced with giant luxury products which were the main theme of the windows. And am I old and jaded...the Oxford Street lights are all white. What happened to the red, gold and glitter of my childhood??Maybe families should just keep walking till they get to Regent Street and Hamleys -toys, toys and more toys. What more could a child ask for"

We had expected crowds - it is the last Friday before Christmas - but it was comfortable. Entry into the park was easy. We arrived around 11.30am. Lots of brightly coloured stalls selling food and a lot of gifts. There was a short queue to buy tickets. We opted for the circus and the ferris wheel. We also bought 'tokens' to enable the boys to go on some of the rides.The circus show was about 50 minutes long. Very entertaining, good showmanship and my sceptical 3 year old was captivated. The ferris wheel was a bit draughty and cold - the doors are not sealed shut as they are on the London Eye, but we appreciated the view across the Park and over London.There are so many stalls selling food we didn't know where to start. We opted for a burger each which was cooked freshly. It's not cheap, but you can't go into an attraction like this and expect it to be reasonably priced. The rides were a good mix of family - little train, low aeroplanes, carousel - and the thrill seeking. We left around 4pm as it was getting dark and cold and the boys were flagging. If they were older I wouldn't have minded staying later. This was good fun, not overcrowded and lots to entertain the whole family. I think we were fortunate with the timing of our visit, I've heard it gets very busy at the weekend. Plan ahead!"

I had booked the observation wheel, Ice Kingdom and evening circus thank goodness!. The set up was much the same as last year. My biggest criticism is how expensive the rides and food are. I spent \u00a350 on ride tokens and this paid for 4 rides which quite frankly are very average. Add this to the cost of the other attractions I had already paid for and this makes for an expensive trip which I don't mind if it is worth it. The Ice Kingdom is good but very very cold, we went to one of these in America and they issue you with survival suits! Thankfully it was a mild day and we managed to warm up quite quickly. If you go on a cold day, I would suggest you leave this to the end. The Observation wheel was fine, You went around twice; only downside was the half an hour wait and this was at a quiet time. The circus was good and a great end to the day. The kids loved it and it is worth a visit for that reason but the other reviews regarding the crowds are true. By the end of the day it was extremely busy. We won't be going next year."

The children's rides were great, especially Santa's sleigh and the candy cane bungee and the atmosphere was buzzing.

The money will really add up and this isn't even including the market stalls, which were shockingly over priced, not only that but I really didn't find the markets had that much to offer, there were about 3 christmas ornament shops - I expected there to be more of these seeing as this was a Christmas fair, the rest were handmade tat that probably weren't worth the prices being charged. Nothing special, and quite repetitive with all the bavarian beer places, sausage places and stalls, however there was a pleasant atmosphere, good rides and visually it was really nice. I just think it was a little overrated, I was hoping it would be something more traditional, but instead it was a cross between black bush market and thorpe park. Don't think I will visit again to be honest, but i really recommend this for families who have the cash to treat their kids to a fun day out. Good thing is that it is free to enter.

There were quite a few rides varying from sedate rides for the younger children to more scary rides for the older (braver!) ones. The ice rink was more like a lake and I agree with the earlier comment that trunks would have been more appropriate than skates. There were lots of food and drink stalls. The markets were interesting although some of the stalls were a bit samey. The ice sculpture bit was fully booked so we booked to visit that the following morning. The place was heaving when we arrived but when we left, about 6 you could hardly move and there were droves of people pouring in. Entry to Wonderland is free and whilst the food/drink and attractions are pricey you can choose to spend as much or as little as you want. When we returned the next morning, at 10 when it opened, for the ice sculpture it was much calmer. You could actually see everything there was to see and it was much better - I would recommend visiting at this time. As to the ice sculpture, it took us about 15 mins to walk round. The sculptures were good but so not worth the entrance fee. We visited a similar exhibition In Bruges a couple of years ago, about half the price and streets ahead in terms of content, value and wow factor."

We went on Monday 2 December at around 6:30 PM. We didn't have very young children with us, but we had 4 between the ages of 8 and 14, but even then we were concerned for their safety. It was nothing like we had imagined, and the wonderful images we had seen on the internet, were worlds apart from the reality. My daughter had a mulled wine on the way into the park, to get into the spirit of things, but she threw it away, It wasn't warm, it was BOILING. That was \u00a34.50 down the drain, in a flash. We walked around for about 15 minutes. This wasn't enjoyment. It was a nightmare. We left the sausages, big frying pans and boiling mulled wine, and left the park, never to return to another Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park."

Tubes to hyde park station were fine and it was calm and easy to get around. We were able to sit down and eat in one of the bavarian village hot dog cafes and the hot dog was great (\u00a34.50 though so not cheap).Fast forward to 2pm and it was considerably more busy! People were queuing a long way back and i was told if i exited the event i would not get back in.All attractions were sold out (circus, ice skating, etc)I didnt like the look of the ice skating..... The rink was so wet.... People were falling and getting soaked! By 4pm it was HEAVING and by 6pm as we left the queue was horrendous and the park was rammed. I would not bring children at night. There were also massive queues to buy tokens (most rides cost \u00a34-6) pp! The fairground stalls all cost \u00a33 and people rarely seemed to win.There is a cash machine but since nowhere takes cards bring cash.Beers are \u00a34-5.The market is ok but the one under the london eye is much better and there are rides there and much better food stalls there too.Our group enjoyed the circus.The magical ice kingdom was a bit boring and kids didnt like it.Big wheel was ok but FREEZINg as doors didnt shut right and the floor is meshed. There was also a massive queue.Overall the kids liked it and i was better than 2 yrs ago but we wish we left earlier..... Had to walk to the further tube stations, it was so busy they shut the stations.I would question the safety of this event if a stampede or situation occurred as you are trapped inside and its relatively narrow and unorganised.I wouldnt bother going again. Hellishly expensive and busy. Better places elsewhere in london."

The rides are bigger and so is the Christmas market.Prices range from \u00a33 for a toddlers ride to \u00a38 for the biggest ride. Beware kids ride fares finish at age 12, my daughter is 12 and kept getting asked her age. The rides she went on were all \u00a34, and they all lasted a good while. Her favourites were the alpine hotel, ice mountain, and the waltzer.Think there is more food and drinks places than rides there.Also, floor is covered in heavy duty plastic, so at least you are not walking in mud."

We have just visited Winter Wonderland for the 3rd year running after having enjoyed our previous visits, however this year was a terrible experience and we will not be returning! The queue to enter was over an hour long luckily we had pre booked tickets for the ice kingdom (which was a complete waste of money) so we were able to jump the queue and gain entry, once in winter wonderland it was dangerously over crowed and all we could do was walk in the directional flow of people, being constantly pushed and shoved. Food & drink was again overpriced but it is London and expect nothing different. We made our way to the ice kingdom after only being in the park for 1 1 hour as couldn't stand the over crowing anymore, and was then hit with further disappointment on entering the kingdom, what we envisaged ( a magical ice kingdom all bright & white with lots of twinkling lights and snow machines) was nothing more than a huge black marquee with some ice sculptures of animals, ogres & witches and lots of undressed christmas trees just plonked amongst the sculptures, a complete rip off at \u00a39 each and on leaving the ice kingdom we decided to make a quick exit from the whole place never to return again!!! Another example of something getting too big and becoming unmanageable, dangerous, and a complete rip off!"

Having read a number of different reviews for this venue we nearly decided not to go for fear of being crushed, trampled under foot and over charged for everything. We arrived approx noon on Friday 6th December and walked from Green Park tube station. There were a few people heading in the same direction but it was a pleasant walk to Hyde Park. There is no entrance fee so you could walk round all day from 10am to 10pm and not spend any money and just enjoy the fantastic atmosphere. There are plenty of Christmas stalls which do repeat but come on how many different options of Christmas novelties are there. If you fancied something to eat the choice was pretty good but not if you expect everything for free. We couldn't resist trying the Bratwursts cooked to perfection on one of the many barbecue grills and to be honest \u00a34.50 was well spent. Also later in the day the Angus beefburgers were to die for all washed down with choice of drink. If you don't want to spend your hard earned cash then don't buy anything, bring your own picnic and use one of the many benches. We did book the ice kingdom and ok it was expensive but great to look at the fantastic models carved from blocks of solid ice, what an amazing skill.We also booked to see the evening circus show and was not disappointed. Look out for the amazing high wire act, gosh. As the light began to fade in the park the thousands of coloured lights really stood out and gave a marvellous display and more of an atmosphere. The fun fare, although not our scene was exiting to stand and watch hundreds of people enjoying themselves. Don't criticise the price of everything, because everybody has to earn a living to survive and bear in mind this is London, a major city of the world. Try staying in Venice!!! The park did get more crowded as the evening approached but this was only to be expected with the many people having finished work and now looking for a good time. We will visit again and a word for the organisers make the main entrance thoroufares slightly wider."

This year, apparently the organisers have changed the rules and they've now erected Barricades all along the perimeter of the Park which meant people are no longer free to exit / enterwherever they like. Because there are now are now limited entrances and exits, there was an enormous queue of people stretching right back to Green Park station, all wanting to get into the Park. It was utter Chaos and babies were screaming, people were confused and frustrated and everyone was just basically squashed. They only allowed a certain number of people to enter each time so the queue kept getting longer. It was such an unpleasant experience!!! The Police guarding the vicinity told everyone that it would be a minimum 2 hour wait to get in. (Unless you have already bought advance tickets to the ice Skating rink, Ferries wheel etc, then you get to cut the queue). Once you were in, there were many shops, which were nice. This year there was a large indoor tent where there was a stage with bands / singers and loads more drink stalls. The usual thing, just magnified by about 5 times as compared to last years I believe. But there were just too many people in there. I believe because of the barricades, it makes it impossible for people to enter again once you've exited, so people are reluctant to exit the market, making it terribly crowded in there. I went on a weekend, so maybe if you want to keep your sanity, go on a weekday!"

There is something for everyone, whether you wish to wander through the gardens, soak up some of the local history, exercise until you are red in the face or simply sit and watch the World go by. In the Summer it is a bustling, vibrant sea of individuals and groups, families, tourists and locals. In the Autumn it is a sea of beatiful colours, fantastic nature and heaps of lovely relaxing walks. In the Winter (if we are lucky!) it is a snow-fest of fun, people of all ages with or without pets, running, laughing, having heaps of fun. Every time of year, this is such a magical destination.Close to Marble Arch tube, Hyde Park Corner, Green Park, Bayswater, Lancaster Gate, to name but a few - there are no shortages of ways to get here! You can walk from the vibrant lights of Oxford Street or hop on a bus and travel around the park and hop off wherever you fancy.Wander along the famous Park Lane, which skirts one side of the park and take in the luxurious sites of prestige cars, high end hotels and usually a few famous faces....."

The \"Bouncers\" are like ones on rough pub doors... hearding crowds with no concern for people falling or being squashed. Scarey for small children, and even adults. Even the queue to get into Hyde park was sooo bad it took over an HOUR!!!! People were 5 /6 deep, and there were lots of pushing and shoving. People were almost fighting at one point. We had pre booked ice skating tickets that we could not use, as we couldnt get into the area... We left 2 hours to get into the park and find the rink. Which I think is reasonable. I have asked the company for a refund but was told a flat NO ! The ice rink at 7pm was super packed and actually people speed skating made it quite dangerous for others. So maybe it was a blessing we didnt get to skate. Though my 13 yr old waas very upset. We knew the food and drink would be expensive, its London. So that was OK. Hog roast nice, but at \u00a36.50 each, a bit steep if there are 4 of you. Organisers MUST REVIEW SAFETY LEVELS!! .....I could not recommmend coming here at all. Also be aware of pick pocketers, this is true in any large crowded area. But sure it must be a haven for them.If you want to see a nice German market go to Germany or even Birminghams Market event."

We had been looking for somewhere decent to go to see Santa having been very disappointed last year by Bluewater. We made sure we got there early as we were worried about queuing for Santa. However we walked straight in and there was no queue. Santa was very good and we were allowed to take our own photos which I thought was excellent considering it was all free.There was so many rides suitable for our daughter's age group spread throughout the park and she was extremely happy with the choice. I did not think \u00a32 / \u00a33 per ride was overly expensive considering the park entrance was free and the rides lasted quite a long time.The food and drinks were also very reasonable and cheaper than most places on London. A hog roast sandwich was \u00a36.50 but filled me up all day. Glass of Wine \u00a35!The park got busier as the day wore on but the toilets remained clean as did the park.I have read some of the critical comments on here and wonder what some people expect at a winter wonderland? One person said it had lots of crappy stalls food places and rides? What else did you hope to find?I can imagine it gets expensive the more kids you have and the older they are but that's the same wherever you go. Plus you only spend what you want to, you don't have to go on all the rides or visit all the attractions.As a family with a young child we often find we pay over the odds for places where we cannot participate in most things (such as paying \u00a385 for LEGOLAND but not being able to go on half the rides) so it was nice to see the benefit for once where we got free entry and cheaper rides!I strongly recommend a visit here but just prepared and save!"

Inside, there was no room whatsoever and we were struggling to move through the endless crowds of people. Finding the Ice Kingdom was a lengthy task, but when we eventually found it we hoped we would be rewarded. No such luck.The Magical Ice Kingdom was nothing but depressing. \"Magical\" means \"beautiful or delightful in a way that seems removed from everyday life.\" It was everything but! We were expecting Christmassy, magical scenes, but instead were presented with Ogres with sledgehammers, witches and beheaded people! It was an incredibly short, depressing \"kingdom\" which left me dreading Christmas. I understand why there is a bar near the exit, to drown your sorrows at spending such a ridiculous amount of money on something so depressing! Upon leaving the renamed \"Angry Ice Kingdom,\" we found that stalls and rides were extortionate prices and completely overrated. We left Winter Wonderland feeling disappointed and depressed. Thankfully, a walk up Oxford Street put us all back in the Christmas spirit!Winter Wonderland was not a wonderland, and my daughters decorations in our dining room made a much better Winter Wonderland than they did."

Prices for the rides, food and drink were quite steep. To ride, you have to buy Tokens. Small kids rides are 3 tokens. and if a parent rides with them its another 3 tokens.

As soon as we stepped off the tube we realised something was seriously wrong, they were no longer allowing anyone back on the tube they shut all stations within a mile radius. Great if you know london and where to go to get on at another station.The crowds were immense with absolutely no crowd control, we had pre booked tickets but the queue to even enter the grounds was over a mile long and 6 people deep, the queue stopped moving as so many people were pushing in further up - no crowd control nor any staff memebers about. The tempers in the queue started to flare and two adults started a fight over queue jumping, my poor son was traumastised, we tried to get away from the fighting but the crowds just pushed us back, we were very nearly crushed (and i am not exagerating it was probably one of the most scariest things i have witnessed).We had waited in the queue over an hour at this point and still wasnt near the entrance we had missed our prebooked slots for ice castle and just decided to try and leave - which is great if the tubes hadnt been shut due to the crowds!! we ended up traipsing around london trying to get a tube to take us to the station to get our tails back home, this was a distressing and frightening place to be. No crowd control, nor organisation and lacked a police presence which was utterly required.Horrifying I will never spend that kind of money again to visit our great capital - if i wanted that atmosphere i would put myself in the middle of a gangland turf war!"

We visited the winter wonderland thinking it would be a lovely festive romantic evening out.Instead we got an overpriced, overcrowded fairground- people rammed in to the point you couldn't move and basically rides surrounded by yet another Bavarian market.We visited the magical ice kingdom that cost nine quid each, queued for fifteen minutes despite rebooking and then basically queued the whole way around it struggling to get any photos because of how many people were let in at once. The whole thing took about ten minutes to get round and all in all very disappointing.Ice skating was again pre booked, queued for forty minutes then get the world most uncomfortable and blunt skates- queue again to actually get on the ice. The rink itself was nice with a very pretty tree in the centre- however in my opinion the organisers have got greedy and let far too many people on the ice at once to the extent that it was packed to a dangerous level.The park itself was difficult to navigate with very little in the way of signs etc and heaven help them if there had been an emergency.I have no intention of going back this year or any year in the future!!!"

If you visit when there is no extra attraction like a conert, market etc then you will see everything that the park has to offer, otherwise appreciate that it's going to be a jostle to get through the crowds ( not ideal if you have small children).

There was plenty of interesting Christmassy stalls to explore and lots of food outlets. Because of the number of food stalls the prices were reasonable competitive and there was something for everyone. We were all retired but all felt that it would have been great to make the visit with the Grandchildren as there was so many charming things for the children to see. There were lots of rides ranging from roundabouts for very young children to the big scary ones for the big children ( too scary for me). The Ice rink looked great fun and those on the ice seemed to be enjoying themselves. There were lots of things to see without spending too much but for those that wanted to spend more there was plenty of things to pay for. The rides seemed to cost around the 4 token mark which had to be purchased from a kiosk in the grounds , there were plenty of these around. The day we went there was very little in the way of queues even though the site was very busy. We all enjoyed it and it made the trip a real start to Christmas"

No - there were guards herding everyone towards the back (20 minute walk) and to a queue of 500 or more people. We then got herded in through the gates. It was noisy stuffed with people and we shuffled through. Our two children went on the high flying chairs - \u00a37 each, lasted 3 minutes. But they enjoyed it. The ice skating looked good, but no tickets left. Toilets miles and miles away with massive queues. We finally made it to the street stalls, they looked lovely but we were too exhausted to stop and look. At the end some people just wanted to look at the German market stalls only, but we're told 'no' and were herded towards the massive queue to go through the entire park.Very badly organised. With extremely rude and heavy handed bouncers. Avoid it. Horrendous."

I have a 5 year old and soon learned that this was NOT the charming place I had hoped to have some fun at Christmas. It's probably good fun if you're aged between say 20-35 and want to get drunk with your friends, as you would in a fairground, but didn't love it with a young child. It's far too crowded and busy. The Ice Kingdom was lovely at the start, but soon included quite scary Orc type ice sculptures, with strange noises, which coupled with the dark, scared our child - again probably fine for older children. Zippo's circus was the best bit and felt far more traditional and family friendly. The queues for the Big Wheel are chaotic at best and lots of people shoving in and not well organised at all - why are there no 'time slots' for this as there are for the other paying attractions. It lacked any real charm and was not for us at all. Go if you are in a large group of friends and want to get drunk and go on fairground rides!"

            "review": "Definitely more corporate and less enchanting than previously. We went to Winter Wonderland with my parents, my brother and our one year old. There's not much that is good to take toddlers too, but it is a shame that there is a lack of high chairs, baby changing facilities and an indoor runaround area for littler children so this is not hugely family friendly, probably better to take children from 5 years upwards as these older children seemed to be having a wonderful time. It would be nice to see stalls selling child friendly food and and a non-alcoholic mulled wine version for mums or dads and others who want to join in the festive spirit but without alcohol. We have been every year except last year when our newborn prevented it,and it has gotten progressively larger, more corporate, and more expensive - the jump up in prices was a shock to use this year. I missed the food stalls being at the entrance and the Christmas music with the animated deer head was missing too which has been there every other year. Also some of the stalls that were usually there were missing. So we missed these little touches which had been like coming back to an old friend.In the beginning couple of years there were many more individual stalls selling more interesting stuff. The tat has always been there but before it was much more interesting to look around. Also in the early years the quality of food was better, this year we felt the food quality was really poor in general, and I've noticed other reviewers saying the same. Nice touches were the 'roast your own marshmallows' section and the enormous marquee eating area which will be good when it's cold outside! All the staff were friendly too, which was so nice and a credit to them especially when they must be a bit cold! I think the live music would make it a great place for groups of friends with a bit of money to go one evening to get merry on mulled wine.Overall we kind of agreed that this is the last year we will go for a while because we feel that it has grown so quickly that the organisers haven't had a chance to sit down and think about things like controlling prices and layout and catering for all types of groups, and as a result it's turning into a place devoid of Christmas spirit and individuality and you would be better off going to a travelling circus when it comes your way as you get all the rides and the candyfloss/hotdogs and some tat for a fraction of the price."

            "review": "Pricey Once In But a Wonderful Christmassy Atmosphere. Whilst in London, in November 2013 and on the way to see the lights at Harrods, we passed through Hyde Park and its festive set up / entertainment - Winter Wonderland. I knew very little of this. I knew from other years the odd ride was put up and an ice rink and I knew from the previous year there apparently was not a great deal there and cost to get in. We wondered up to the entrance, feeling if there was a fee to get in, we would not bother but to our surprise it was free.It started off as a delightful little street of mini shops, all looking very Christmassy set up as cabins, with lights and snow for decoration. The stalls sold a multitude of things from sweets to clothing. Basically this was a mini Christmas market as it were. At the end of this were a couple of stalls for eating and drinking. This is where the money must be made! They were selling mulled cider, something my partner and I had never tried so we thought it would be a good time to, getting into the Christmas spirit. The price was \u00a34.30 a cup and it raised our eyebrows somewhat but we had not seen the size of the glass / cup at this stage so gave it the benefit of the doubt. Of course when it was served up it was a very small cup, almost child size you would say. The cider itself was actually very nice, so we laughed it off, learning our lesson not to buy food or drink from this particular attraction!The food bit, which was next to the market stalls, also then linked to the main Wonderland and that is exactly what it was. I am not sure why there was so little there in 2012 (if in fact that is true) but the place was rammed and buzzing with rides, stalls with games and bright, flashing lights everywhere. It was quite a sight and although essentially a very impressive fun fair, it was all winter and Christmas themed and gave you a perfectly warm Christmas feel, as if it was already here. The ice rink was here as always and was very spacious. It does cost to use as you would expect but for those not wanting to pay, watching could be entertainment enough, as people slipped and slid all over the place.Making your way through there were all types of rides - rollercoaster's, huge tall rides that shot you up and down again, ghost houses, children's rides, a Ferris wheel and a very impressive looking winter cave. On top of this there was a multitude of stalls with games, where you could win prizes. As we walked around in the circle layout, it seemed to go on forever, there is an awful lot to do here. Of course the downside to this is, that everything will cost you to go on or participate. We were only passing, enjoying the sights and getting an early dosage of Christmas feeling so we did not look at prices for each ride unfortunately - however if the cider was anything to go by, it would not have been that cheap.All in all, we were really pleased we passed this and walked through. It was a terrific sight to see all the lights flashing, decorations and rides launching into life - not to mention some great music being played. Plus it really gave you that feeling of Christmas and fun. If rides and / or Christmas are not your thing, I would not recommend this at all. Be wary of prices too, particularly on the food and drink front, probably picking stuff up from newsagents for far cheaper if possible. If you have the time and happy to spend a bit on rides / attractions you would have a whale of a time here and I could think of far worse things to do on a cold, winters evening. Oh and for those who wondered, the lights at Harrods were well worth a view too - impressive as ever!"

Found a couple of stalls selling mulled wine for \u00a34 and it was good quality. The atmosphere was lovely and the festive music could be heard all around. The ice Kingdom was great.

No fast track on the wheel for prepaid folk but there wasn't a cue when we went so didn't need to complain. The rides looked fantastic. We spent a lot of time stood watching with a mulled wine, and wondering how people had the nerves to go on these things! We went in the haunted mansion (\u00a35) which was a good giggle and got the heart rate up, the mousetrap (\u00a36) which a) reminded me of being a kid at Blackpool and b) terrified and traumatised me, and the waltzers (\u00a36) which were the best ride in my opinion. Foodwise there is so much to choose from. Grab a bite from a stall and there's so many huts to sit in or benches to stand at, or wander further into the park and there's little restaurants and even big dining halls. Cheaper end of the food range \u00a34-\u00a36 or \u00a312-\u00a315 if dining in one of the halls. Everything so festive though with a great atmosphere. There's also a carousel bar which slowly spins as you drink. Beautiful. The stalls were plentiful and we must have looked round them several times, each time seeing something new. We left approx 7.30pm. It was busier than in the day but no great crowds. I think we chose well to go on a Tuesday as our friends sent in Saturday and described crowds like some of the other reviews do. Definately worth a visit."

Watch out for careless people with cigarettes dangling by their sides as they wander around. Too many near miss cigarette burns on clothes!The ice rink looked far too crowded. If someone fell It looked like a collision would be inevitable.The Magical Ice Kingdom can be seen in 5 minutes!! It only takes longer to see if you have to stop and wait for someone taking photos ahead of you. It is as expected VERY cold. The ice slide is ok which everyone can go on if they wish adults too. There is a lot of graffiti written on an ice wall even though there is a notice asking people NOT to do this! This really did spoil the scene. Its very samey, lots of the same ice trees etc to look at. Some models really do look good but it isn't worth the \u00a39 entry fee. At the end there is a photo opportunity when two pic's are taken but the sting is \u00a38 for one print or \u00a310 for the two.Mulled wine is \u00a34.20 a cup and mulled wine with a shot of Amaretto in is \u00a36 a cup.Yes it is free to walk around but it would be impossible not to spend a fortune here with children.There are Christmas Market huts selling the same goods at Southbank. There are only a very few rides at Southbank and a Father Christmas whom really does look like Father Christmas wandering about. My advice would be to avoid Winter Wonderland and head for Southbank instead!"

They decided to stagger groups entering as the park was so full. We stood and watched as on opening the barriers as mass of people surged forward. It would have been awful for people with young children, I think.Appeared totally unsafe and I doubt anyone would have got near the rides due to the sheer volume of people.

We went the 1st weekend it opened and the crowds wasn't bad at all during the day. At about 7.30pm it got a lot busier with a lot of adults without children visiting. There was hen parties and stag parties there but I didn't see any rowdy behaviour just people having fun. There really is something for everyone there whether you have children with you or not. Loved the look of the apr\u00e8s ski bar and carousel bar. My 6 year old loved the rides and id like to thank the man who gave my husband \u00a340 of tokens as he was leaving the park. I didn't see any shelter so if it rained you might not want to be there. We visited the ice kingdom and it is freezing in there. 30 minutes was the most we could last in there. As you walk out of there the cold London air actually feels warm which gives you some idea of how cold it is in there. You definitely shouldn't take small children or babies in there. Its lots of impressive ice sculptures, a small ice bar and a short ice slide that everyone got stuck on. I'm used to working outside in all weathers and know layers are what keeps you warm. I had thermals and layers on top that day and still was freezing in there. We looked at the ice skating rink which was a lot smaller than I expected and had too many people on it. It looked like you had to be of a reasonable standard of skating to go on as you had to follow the crowd tightly round. I didn't see any stewards inside the winter wonderland at all and only a couple on the entrances. I didn't see any lost children point and would like to know what arrangements are in place if a child went missing as there was no announcement tannoy. I also didn't see any first aid but im sure there must have been somewhere. It really is bigger than you first think in there. I'd like to think there are a lot of undercover police policing the event. Flooring was laid everywhere so you wasn't walking in mud anywhere as i'm sure in previous years I have read that it was muddy. Also we didn't queue for more than 5 minutes for any ride but the queue for father Christmas looked long. We had a great time and I really don't think there's anywhere else like here"

As for value for money- probably not worth it. As for the other rides etc... Prices are ridiculous. My husband bought the ride tokens just so our children could experience some of what was on offer. We ended up having to give them away however as the area became so overcrowded it was impossible to get around. As others have mentioned the place was seriously dangerous on Saturday night. There are only a few exits and lots of dead ends so people were stuck like cattle unable to move. We had two children with us the youngest was on several occasions crushed and pushed by adults. If there had been a security issue/ emergency I would not like to think of what would have happened.We were so angry leaving we actually contacted the police and placed a complaint.

The fun fair is very expensive and I'd imagine the queues get worse as the day goes on. We arrived at 11'ish and left at 15'ish and it was noticeably how much busier it got during that time, as we left the queue to get in was awful.

A free event that they let too many people into (the kept closing it due to overcrowding). Inside you could barely move, at times coming to a standstill as no one could get anywhere and more enclosed than in a crowd at a festival. Lots of bars and hot dog stands. Very few market stalls and a lot of people consuming alcohol making it a dangerous environment for youngsters. The ice kingdom was pretty impressive and remember to wrap up warm as it's sooo cold.

We last came here a few years ago and it consisted of 20 market stalls and funfair rides. It has now in my opinion got better.

Yes the food and drink retailers seem to cash in uneccessarily, \u00a32.50 for a can of coke....really?, but thats a typical tourist area trait...tarnish the experience though it does. Yes it was uncomfortably crowded, again this is to be expected at a tourist attraction during a popular time...think a beach on a hot bank holiday. This is what christmas is about and I enjoyed the market and atmosphere. As for other attractions, not so great. I dont think christmas is a time for funfair attractions, especially as they are overpriced, hard for families with young children I'm sure. If you want funfair then go to a theme park. This should be a christmas attraction. We arrived at hyde park quite early and already announcements were being made over a tannoy that tickets were sold out for events that day.Overall, the market is nice but the rest is a bit money grabbing. I would definately go again next year....just to the market. It was a good idea to seperate the market from the funfair so you could avoid that part."

The \"German Village\" section was almost identical to Christmas Markets we've gone to out here. The other section just seemed like any other carnival/fair I've been to. There were duplicate market stalls everywhere, so while it initially seems like there are hundreds of different sellers, there are really only a fraction . Most seemed to be selling mass produced things like hats and scarves or other trinkets. The food there was all over priced, with most drinks costing almost \u00a35 each and the food well over that. The carnival games were equally pricey. Ice skating and the circus were absurdly expensive, but we did end up going to the circus to kill some time. It was an hour long, and not as bad as I expected, but definitely not worth the massive price tag. Overall it was a decent way to spend some time walking around and taking in the \"Christmas Spirit\", but I would definitely not want to go with small children or plan on playing many games or going on many rides."

With lots of people attending it also meant it was hard to get to see what was on the stands.

This year it was different - badly organised and absolutely no crowd control. The risk of crush injuries to young children is VERY REAL! We observed horrifying scenes last night and the staff prohibited us from using the escape lanes as they \"weren't allowed\" - ABSOLUTE MADNESS!"

Great fun for all ages but I would suggest you visit on a week day if you can as the crowds on weekends are enormous, loads of rides, bars and different forms of entertainment everywhere you look, this is not just for kids people of any age can go and enjoy themselves here they cater for everyone, be warned your bank account will take a beating but you will have great fun.If you are gluten intolerant you will not find anything to eat in the whole place but that is the only reason I have gave 4 and not 5 stars.Go there you wont regret it."

The \"from\" prices really are what they say and the majority of rides will cost you a lot more. If you also want that famous ice slide experience I would suggest pouring some hot water down your driveway on a frosty night: cheaper, less queuing and probably a few feet bigger! The only upside is the food and drink which is standard pricing for London and what you would expect from a Christmas market. It seems that a lot of effort goes into this side of the event and they do a decent job which is sadly let down by the rest. The event was as claustrophobic as the tube on the way home but at least the tube was warm."

Went to Winter Wonderland on Saturday 22nd November Variety of stalls and rides, shops, eateries and bars could not be faulted but brace yourselves for a ridiculously expensive experience. Quite apart from the various pre bookable attractions which are really pricey, the rides at the attraction are bonkersly expensive. You buy tokens for the rides and \u00a31 = 1 token. Then each of the rides has a token price. One of the rides in particular was 6 tokens per person. So for what was probably a 90 second ride, for a family of 4 would have been twenty four pounds. Additionally the food is extremely pricey. \u00a33.50 for a corn on the cob when you can buy four in tesco for less than that. It's nice to get you in the Christmas spirit but unless you've ram raided a post office recently or you have the self control of a ninja, you will notice a rather enormous hole in your finances when you come out. There's over priced and then there's taking the ****. I'll leave you to decide which category Winter Wonderland falls into. Merry Christmas!"

Sickeningly expensive, I work hard and earn a decent wage but even so, the prices were completely DISGUSTING. 7 pounds for one ride, food and drink grossly over priced and the circus was awful/boring/bad and felt very budget. I've seen some amazing circus type acts in the past and the circus should be embarrassed by their 'performance' it was laughable if it hadn't costed 12 each. The 'Knife thrower' was about 2 feet away from the board, I could have done it myself, blindfolded and drunk. The park and attractions were terribly signposted so that you walk around in circles and you can't get anywhere fast!! If you have a family, you might like to remortgage the house first!The few good points: It does have a nice atmosphere, which is exciting as it feels festive and fun, lots of rides from super scary to kids ones, good bars and music, lots of drink and food stalls.**Be warned, take cash with you as the two ATM queues are long and you get charged 2.95 for (slow) cash withdrawal, naturally.

I've always had a good time and I would definitely recommend it. I would say it's more of a fair than a Christmas market. There're a reasonable number of stalls and there are some nice things, but it doesn't really compare to the markets you get in Europe at this time of the year; you're really going to eat and drink and go on the rides. I had a bratwurst with sauerkraut in the Bavarian village (\u00a35). It was nice, but not really hot enough. I also had two mulled wines (\u00a38). I recommend the one in the Bavarian village called red Viking blood or something like that; my friend tried others as we went round and they didn't really compare. I didn't go on a ride this year, but I remember going on the zip wire last year (\u00a315!) and the drop tower the year before that, which might have been \u00a37 or \u00a38. Both were a lot of fun (the zip wire isn't there this year). I think, if you plan on doing something similar, so getting a snack, a drink or two and going on a ride, it's affordable, but if you're planning on doing more than that, then you need to bring plenty of money with you. I went on a weekday this year, so there was plenty of room to walk around in and I felt very relaxed; in previous years, I've always gone at the weekend and I really wouldn't recommend it. I think it's nice to go in the afternoon and stay until it gets dark when the place looks quite different. The staff are nice and friendly; it's very well-organised and there're people collecting rubbish and wiping down tables all the time, so it's super clean and tidy. Having recently gone to a Bonfire night event at Alexandra Palace which was a complete and utter disaster, those guys could learn a lot from whoever is behind Winter Wonderland."

It was so packed you couldn't freely walk anywhere which was quite scary for my 7 year old, the rides were incredibly expensive and some were ridiculously short. However my biggest concern was the amount of alcohol being consumed around children in Bavarian type bars, this is supposed to be a family event, we left at about 5.30pm I hate to think what it was like later! I booked for us all to go to the magical Ice Kingdom, which was the biggest let down, my girls were completely disinterested and the slide which was supposed to be the finale of the event was pathetic!!

Toilets are minimal. I like to walk through it from the March arch to knightsbridge, which doesn't take that long. I've picked a sandwich from Harrods and had myself a little picnic on a park bench.

Seeing the light displays in the dark is beautiful. 2) How much your wallet was robbed of cash.There were 2 adults and 3 kids in my family.

Crowds of people everywhere - I lost count of the number of times I got whacked round the head by people using the feet of children on their shoulders as battering rams to forge a path through the crowds (I'm not even exaggerating.) The fairground rides are exorbitantly priced. Yes, it's free to get in, but if you want to buy anything, eat anything or go on any of the rides then you will be paying a small fortune. There is nothing to look at (except for the stalls) that isn't going to cost you money and things like the Ice Kingdom and the Ice Rink needed to be pre-booked anyway. On the plus side, the cost of the rides keeps the queues relatively short.I ended the day feeling stressed and decidedly un-Christmassy - won't be returning!"

I have seen firework displays, pop concerts, marathon runs, eccentric ice cream carts, lovely displays of spring flowers, and last but not least the biggest variety of happy relaxed visitors that you could wish to see.Try Sunday morning on a sunny day. Visitors to London, this city can be very wearing and Hyde Park is an oasis of calm. In the summer, you may hire a boat for rowing which is a very good therapy in itself. The brave and perhaps the fool hardy tend to swim at all times of the year in the swimming club area allocated for this purpose. There is an old British tradition of swimming on Christmas Day.Don't forget the Lady Diana Memorial which consists of running water which appears to go in two directions at the same time and is very beautiful.There is a very crowded restaurant to the east end of the lake which I suggest is avoided at peak times due to sheer overcrowding.Don't forget the speakers corner on Sunday morning but unfortunately its activities are much more muted than they have been in previous years. I must admit this is the one feature that I have not visited for some time.In the spring and summer there are lovely rose gardens in full bloom and the Royal Garden keepers make sure that the appearance is always as you would expect of a garden that has been established for so many years.There is a very good art gallery called the Serpentine adjacent to the Diana feature and is always worth a visit.I say this to visitors particularly from the United States, don't try to take all of London in in one go, you will not do it so why not spend a happy morning or afternoon wandering around, talking to people and unwinding. it might be a good way to do your recovery from jetlag on the first morning."

My finance and I were in London for the weekend and decided to visit Hyde Park's Winter Wondeland.We arrived at around 5pm with the view to go out for dinner after a couple of hours in the Winter Wonderland.Dinner went COMPLETELY out the window!The lights and magic turned us into hyperactive overgrown children, we went on all the rides and played all the wonderful fair games such as coconut shy, shooting, archery etc.We had to ask for a bin liner to contain all the stuffed toys we had won!!We stopped at every bar, enjoying mulled wine and German beers and had a big German sausage for dinner. There was a fantastic 50's band at one bar and we couldn't help but get up and dance.All the stalls had high quality merchandise, we bought some souvenirs and Christmas decs from a few.We left around 10:45pm, a little drunk and our insides hurting from laughing so much.We thoroughly enjoyed being big kids and will return every year :D"

First year we booked a restaurant to eat in, not knowing how everything was set out, though since then we just eat where we fancy on the day as there are so many options. Our favourite is now the noodle station! We are usually bitter cold so make sure you wrap up warm! We go ice skating every time, its well set up, if you're late they still let you on for the remainder of the time and is really fun. Unfortunately we get told we can't take pictures while on the ice (we sneak a few in ) but as all of us are skating it would be nice to be able to take some ourselves. The ice kingdom is great to see, but as it is so cold in there, once is enough when there is nowhere to warm up!I think this is a great day out at christmas and I love the christmas market and all the festive food and drinks and the snow machines, its a great atmosphere!"

When we rushed to the underground station, we found the ticket machine had problem taking credit cards. Fortunately, we still had some cash to buy 8 one-day passes for the group. We got off at Hyde Park Corner station and entered the park via a classical style gateway designed in 1825 near the two pairs and two single gates of forged stainless steel and bronze Queen Elizabeth Gate. We were lucky to see a carriage led by two horses just like those seen in the old day movies. Not far after we passed the path that shared with cyclists, we saw the Rose Garden. It had not only the roses but also shrubs and herbaceous flowers. We passed the Boy and Dolphin statue while entering the garden, but the dolphin looked more like a big fish. On the left is a fountain with the bronze figure of the Greek goddess shooting an arrow. The flowers were so beautiful when we visited in early July.We did not have breakfast, so we decided to have some light brunch at the Serpentine Bar & Kitchen on the lakeside of Serpentine. The Serpentine in Hyde Park and the Long Water in Kensington Garden was created by Queen Caroline in 1726-1730. The restaurant is a nice place to watch the water birds. We saw swans with their babies, ducks and some unknown birds. After the light lunch, we went along the path with the lake on our right. We spent some time photographing on the wildlife in the lake. The water birds also created annoying side effect \u2013 guano all over the shore. Before we approached the Lido, I saw a man feeding birds on his palm. It required patience and skill for the birds to come for food. The Lido and clock tower were built in 1930 as a changing room and is now a restaurant. Lido Cafe Bar has waterside tables and is the ideal place to enjoy a snack or a glass of cold drink in the hot summer day. We ended up at Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain. It is a place for people to remember the good things that Diana brought to us. We did not cross the Serpentine Bridge but continued our travel to the next door - Kensington Gardens. If you visit Hyde Park, you must spare some time to discover Kensington Gardens and its Italian Gardens at the end of The Long Water Lake.London residents are so lucky to have many big gardens and parks in the center of London. Hyde Park is one of the eight Royal Parks in London; it covers 350 acres and has famous landmarks such as the Serpentine Lake, Speakers' Corner and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain. I certainly will come back again to visit the other side of the Serpentine Lake sometime in the future."

It was a beautiful sunny day and though it was a hassle getting the bikes free from their locking stations with big queues of tourists trying to figure out how to work the machines, it was worth it in the end. In all the years I have been visiting London, I couldn't believe I had hardly been to Hyde Park! It was amazing to think that this amazing space was just a short walk from the madness of Oxford Street.The first thing we saw which took my breath away was the Horse Guards from the Palace in full regalia walking their horses by the park. We cycled all round the lake, stopping to take pictures and admire the views and stopped for food and drink at one of the cafes. People were cycling and walking all around with families playing and picnicking on the grass and people were taking boats out on the water.We stopped by the Princess Diana Memorial Garden and saw lots of children playing in the stream which was lovely. The whole park is so nice and beautifully kept with some nice wildlife, it's a beautiful oasis away from the bustle of central London. It's a wonderful place to experience some peace in the city and a great way to do it is by hiring a bike. The Barclays bikes are sturdy and easy to ride and good value too. Don't know why I have never taken the time to explore Hyde Park before - it is stunning."

You can pedal in the river (which very fun, but remember to use sunblock if it's sunny) and I tried and it turned out very nice. It's a paradise in the center of London, with nice birds and ducks and squirrels..and just so much to see! It's very nice just to talk a simple walk through there, not essentially tour it all over. It refreshes you, with all its tall trees and ever-running fountains. A must-see of London."

We walked to Hyde Park from Buckingham Palace and it was a short, refreshing distance to cover, so I would recommend that you fit it in with the other touristy bits. I've always wanted to visit Hyde Park, especially to see the Serpentine, as it has featured in so many books that I've read. It is a wonderful, quaint park with several different paths to follow. We decided to pay for a pedalo on the Serpentine as a way to pass the time. For \u00a312 each we had an hour on the water and it was very relaxing. If the weather is decent, I would highly recommend this as the views were decent and we really enjoyed it. There's lots of wildlife in the park, including swans, various species of ducks/water birds and squirrels to name a few. All want you to feed them and will come up to you if you let them. It's a good place to pass the time and it's something different to the usual tourist traps in the city. I'll definitely be back."

The biggest park in central London and one of London\u2019s eight Royal Parks, Hyde Park opened in 1637.With plenty of wide open green space to go for a walk or relax in on a sunny day, the park is divided by the Serpentine, a recreational lake. Rowing & pedal boats are available and you can swim too from june to september. Restaurants, Cafes and free public toilets can be found in the park.Generally not mentionned, London parks are great places to spot squirrels. They are not afraid of humans at all & usually get pretty close hoping to be fed.Near the Marble Arch entrance, you\u2019ll find The speakers\u2019 Corner, where every sunday, anyone can speak their mind on any subject. Extreme religious or political views, conspiracy theories and the likes make this a London attraction in itself. Whether you find it interesting or absurb, it\u2019s worth a visit.Hyde Park also hosts numerous events, from famous rock concerts to Winter Wonderland during the winter holiday season.The park opens throughout the year from 5 am to midnight. Although contiguous with Kensington Gardens, they are separate parks and open/close at different times.Located in the city of Westminster. Get off at underground stations Marble Arch, Hyde Park Corner or Knightsbridge.You can check out lots of pictures here : http://cappuccinofields.com/2013/09/19/london-parks-hyde-park/"

It is a massive vast of green grassy lawn, walk paths, lakes, and natural in all its surroundings. It has lots of walking paths where people jog daily while listening to their ipods, bicycles have a special lane , even horses have a walking area! You see many people riding their horses in here at times.There are different types of gardens in one really, you have the hugely open vast one, when you see family ball games or people picnicking ( people of all nationalities), then you have specific areas more dense and with lots of trees, here you will find squirrels popping in front of you for food. Pleasant walking experiences, you also have Fountain Place which is a sitting area around a fountain of course, very relaxing and toilet facilities are plenty. You then have another larger area (some little rolling hills) and a very large lake where you feed the ducks and see them in groups 'sailing' by... very cute sight indeed. You also have restaurants surrounding the lake and lots of benches. Here it is common to see skate boarders bicyclists, people on roller skates and people from all walks of life in their national costumes.There are fast food stalls near the waterside, and you can go for paddle boat rides ( a fee for this). Many families are here , mothers with strollers too. In the surrounding area just outside Hyde Park, there are many apartment buildings of various prices, one side might be classy and expensive and another you will find cheaper.. Hyde park is that big! There are also a variety of shops and souvenir shops just across the road, great restaurants can be seen very close too. Crossing the road is no problem as you have a tiny zebra crossings, and it is so easy to return back to the park if you wish too.Every Saturday or Sunday , there is the \"Speaker Corner\" Day where some people will stand on a box and speak out what they have on their minds no matter what it is-some hilarious things happen there! Lots of public events go on there like concerts etc, lots happening so never a boring moment! Definitely a beautiful atmosphere and late mornings and early afternoons are the best times to go.The great thing is about Hyde Park, you can plan to spend your time there, go out and shop nearby and meet lots of people.Tips:* Take some snacks and drinks if you don't want to buy any there... mind you, you will be tempted!* Take a chair or blanket to sit down or for picnics.* Take a camera to catch those special moments of the ducks near the lake, the pigeons flying down on you after food, and all the scenery!*Take some wet wipes or disinfectant wipes, they always come in handy.* Take a foldable shopping bag , just in case you do go across the road to shop.* Take dry or stale bread pieces with you for the ducks, snacks for the squirrels too."

I know London is expensive but didn't count on it being that expensive. However I did notice not one English person in the queue.

Assuming you're not already worn out from walking around London, then Hyde Park is a very large open space with mostly grassy expanses, few floral parts, lots of established trees, a big lake with water foul and even an enclosed kids play ground. If your kids need to run, kick a ball, fly a kite, chase pigeons, etc. then this is the place to go in London. It is adjacent to Kensington Gardens with its Diana Memorial Playground (fantastic place). The Albert Memorial is here too plus a number of fancy wrought iron gates and stone masonry arches celebrating various people/events. If you're on a bike, then note that some of the pathways are pedestrian only."

There is also a great playground for those with smaller children. You can take advantage of the various refreshment stands scattered throughout or keep the cost down and take your own. Great day out.

What a beautiful oasis in the middle of a city! There is plenty to do for everyone. If you are a bike rider, jogger, or roller skater, there are long paths for you to use. If you want to exercise your horse, there are dirt roads to accommodate your needs. I especially like it when the royal horsemen come through. At my age now, I enjoy the tranquility. There are numerous benches throughout the park grounds, along Serpentine Lake, etc. The park is full of docile squirrels, ducks, geese, etc. who have perfected \"free hand outs\" from the tourists. I have seen several pictures being taken by amused tourists when a particular animal or fowl is eating out of their hands. The flowers beds and grounds are kept up constantly and I love the rose garden area when it is the proper season. I've taken many pictures there. Drinking a cup of coffee in a tranquil rose garden and just watching the people come through can be a relaxing event. Of course, there is the Diana Memorial, Kensington Palace, and even rock concerts in this park from time to time. For me, just strolling through this beautiful place and sitting on a bench taking everything in is always a high point of my London trips."

There are plenty of food kiosks and toilets located throughout the park, although they are easier to find during a Race for Life event. The park also has a stunning lake and some beautiful fountains, including the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain.When I went to my last Race For Life, the stage area was quite a walk from the Hyde Park Corner station entrance but the 5K walk itself was well-signposted and ended near the stage area, meaning that I didn't need to walk too far back for the stage and the stalls. What was also helpful that there was an exit close to the starting point of the walk. As for Winter Wonderland, it has a wide range of stalls and places to eat although a lot of the things sold there are expensive.All in all, this park is definitely worth a visit when Race for Life and Winter Wonderland are on. 4/5."

Glad we spent the extra cash for those tickets. Really great day from start at 12 noon till finish about 11pm. The hottest day of the year - sun shining - Hyde Park at its best. The hospitality provided all you could eat/drink food, soft drinks, water, wine & beer - champers and spirits were charged for. The food was great, atmosphere great. We took a few forays out into the other areas where there were lots of food kiosks and fun fair attractions. Just the ladies loos were worth the extra cost - clean/enough stalls so no horrendous queues! The seating area had a really good area for wheelchairs etc. There were several good bands playing on smaller stages as well as the main stage. Best of the opening acts was Jake Bugg then the Stones were as awesome as always. 50 & Counting! One of those days you hated to see end!! Well worth it."

If you want a place to chill out and relax then it's a good green space in London to do it in. I'm sure the genuine tourists would appreciate it."

Seeing the Rolling Stones on 13th July there helped (!) but strolling through the park the next day reminded us what a great green lung for London it is.The Italian Garden; the Serpentine Gallery; the Serpentine itself; the acres of (brown at the moment in the 30C heat!) grass and shady trees; the formal gardens and orangery at Kensington Palace - there's a lot to see.Not many refreshment places, but that's typically London, so take your own.Watch out for the (many) bikes - and rent a \"Boris Bike\" off the racks for yourself if you fancy getting around a little quicker. They're cheap and convenient. Or rent a colourful deck-chair for 3 hours for \u00a34; \u00a37 all day."

If the guests I have are classy, there's the Hummgbird shop for cakes a couple of doors down.This area is also excellent if the weather looks nasty and you want to do the museums instead. Head towards the Albert Memorial and the Exhibition Road will bring you to the museums.The Albert Memorial, itself, is an excellent photo opportunity. The Diana memorial as a place for kids to play and there are also areas with swings etc. for kids. For adults there's always the bike hire stands dotted around.

This, being one of the Royal Parks of London, is so big that I suggest you have at least half the day to stroll around, see the amazing sights and take in the tranquil atmosphere. I started my journey from the Marlborough gate, where the Italian Garden is situated. This garden is beautiful, created to reflect the 'Renaissance Italy'. There are plenty of kiosks selling food and drink, if ever you are hungry. There are also cafes, notably the Lido restaurant and the Serpentine cafe, as they overlook the Serpentine whilst you enjoy your cuppa. Do exercise caution as you walk, especially along the Serpentine, because of the s*** left by dogs and the ducks. If you think you are tired, you can always leave by the nearest gate, as there are plenty of exits around the park. If you have more time, you can also walk over to the Kensington Gardens, which is adjacent to the park. The Orangery at the Kensington Gardens is well-known for its afternoon tea."

Hyde Park is a huge place and event with its thousands of visitors inside, there is still plenty of open space. The lake is great, with lots of swans, geese, ducks and other birds. there are Pedalo's to hire and other boats. It is so nice to see so many people enjoying a communal place, having picnics and just spending family time. The Princess Diana Memorial Fountain is amazing, it was the highlight to our Children's visit to London! It is great to paddle and walk around the fountain."

You can forget that you are in the middle of London while walking through the park due to its size. It is very central in location and provides a good venue for a day out with family friends or on your own. The lake is not very deep but to suitable for swimming which is prohibited. One can feed the ducks and swans along the lake or have a cup of tea or enjoy a meal at the nearby cafe/ restaurant overlooking the lake. Allow 2-3 hours for a good look around ! It can be a bit lonely in the night hence I would recommend walking around during daylight especially if you are single and female - I guess I am being too cautious as the location in central London and there are probably a hundred CCTV cameras around - clearly common sense judgement required!"

At the end of the 17th century, Kensington Gardens became a separate entity when King William and Queen Mary decided to take up residency at Kensington Palace. The Serpentine (a man-made lake) and Long Lake (a narrower lake on the western edge) became the dividing line between the two parks.Kensington Palace and Albert Memorial are located inside this well maintained and clean park. Multiple playgrounds are available for kids.Check a map so that you can plan what you want to see. The vegetation will present itself differently depending on the time of year.

However, taking in the sights of the green tree tops and the brown tree bows was more desirable and the odd person on the interspersed benches soon became agreeable to my eyes.

Also, renting the bikes can be scary on some of the main streets in London (especially if you are used to driving/biking on the other side of the road!) but it was very easy to do in Hyde Park on flat, clearly marked bike lanes =) So many flowers and people enjoying the park."

Bounded to the North East by Marble Arch (used to be the entrance to Buckingham Palace until they moved it because it was too small to get the coaches through), Edgware Road and Oxford Street. On the East side is Park Lane with all the posh hotels and car salesrooms. Also an underground car park if you need one, although it's best to do without the car in London. South East corner is Hyde Park Corner, with Piccadilly running off to the east up past the original Hard Rock Cafe, Green Park (10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace), the Ritz and on to Piccadilly Circus. To the South, Knightsbridge, Brompton Road and Harrods. To the West, Kensington Curch Street with lots of interesting shops. To the North West, Bayswater, Queensway with more shops and restaurants. And right in the middle, the Serpentine (lake) used in the 2012 Olympics. Just enjoy the space. And of course every so often there is a huge concert............"

With many major theme park attractions and side show alleys combined with European christmas market crafts, German bier tents, and a sneaky mulled wine and chocolate covered pretzel, there is certainly something for every member of the family. An all day event that needs to be well thought out and planned, particularly if you are coming from the outter areas of London as it is a major attraction and public transport can get very busy. I would recommend wearing gumboots (wellingtons or galoshes) or comfortable waterproof boots and taking an umbrella or plastic poncho as a back up. Have a generous spending limit as each and every ride, tent or vendor costs a tidy sum, Great day had by all."

From there you can walk to the Princess Diana Memorial Garden which must be fun for kids, old and young alike in the summer months when they can walk in the cascading water. Then it's onto see the Serpentine lake where you can watch the ducks, swans and moor hens going about their day. If you dress up warm to keep out the wind and winter weather, taking a walk in this beautiful Royal park is well worth the effort and if you take a few peanuts (unsalted) in your pocket you are sure to get a chance to feed the squirrels who were amazingly bold in approaching people walking along quiet pathways.

The Observation wheel is only in Hyde Park for a few weeks every year from the third week of November till the New Year when it gets dismantled with the rest of the fair side shows and attractions for another year......In Hyde Park on a Sunday morning you can go to listen to people speaking about different views on various topics which is interesting - even if you do not always agree.....There is also Peter Pan playground in Kensington Gardens where children can play for free and there is a wooden ship to climb on .... The playground is nearest ot Bayswater underground station in Queensway......There is also the Serpentine river where you can go boating and in the summer even swimming.....There is the Princess Diana memorial also near the boating lake that is definitely worth going to - as well as Kensington Palace and the Orangery Cafe for a cup of coffee and a cake after visiting Kensington gardens where Princess Diana used to live and Princess Margaret. There is also the Serpentine Gallery that is definitely always worth seeing and most exhibitions are free.....The prince Albert memorial has been cleaned up and is also an attraction worth seeing when walking through Hyde Park towards the Royal Albert Hall..On weekends it is also possible to hire horses and ride on special tracks around Hyde park with the people from the stables with you....That is a different way to view Hyde Park........"

A free-to-enter attraction that offers traditional German-style Christmas markets, bars and pubs selling mulled wine and other winter-warmers and and a fairground working on a token system. One token is \u00a31 with rides being around 3- 5 tokens per ride. I loved the German markets and got a very Christmassy sensation around this part however found the fairground to be tacky and overpriced. We went on a Friday afternoon and left at around 6pm before the large number of crowds entered. At peak times they restrict entry based on crowd levels so choose your time wisely.We visited the Ice Cave set up in the park, with an Ice Maze and sculptures enclosed in a temperature-controlled building. Very cold but very interesting and that was worth the price of ticket."

The park was very beautiful but we were a little intimidated by so many \"black flowing robes\". Taking pictures was a problem because of the excess of ladies in black everywhere. I was verbally attacked a number of times because I was pointing a camera at them - even though I was really trying to get a photo of the park. On the Speaker's Corner. Police presence was a little scary. Very outspoken muslimmen for the most part whose voices were very angry..

So we were able to walk around and enjoy our adult beverages. They had little shops all throughout. The rides looked so much fun and there were so many! There was an ice skating rink but it was too long of a wait for us to do that. They had an ice sculpture display that you were able to walk through that was so cool. They had a \"beer carousel.\" It was just a great way to spend the night. I left my camera at the hotel that night and I really wish I didn't because there was plenty to take pictures of.

The thought of going through a German-style Christmas market sounded exciting (we love the markets in Munich), and I wanted to go through the Magical Ice Kingdom. I booked the Ice Kingdom tickets in advance so that we wouldn't have to worry about getting tickets upon arrival. I received our e-tickets fairly soon after payment. You do not have to pay to get into the \"wonderland\". If the grounds are too crowded, they limit people going in, but if you have tickets for a timed event you can get into a different line so that you don't miss your ticket time.We arrived around 4pm on Sunday and it was packed! It was difficult to get through the grounds because people would stop wherever they were to watch some of the rides. We arrived at the Ice Kingdom and told to queue up. We went in before the time on our tickets and it wasn't too bad of a line once inside. Folks were stopping to take pictures and if you were ready to continue you could just pass them. There was an ice slide and there were only a few people in front of us to go down. We enjoyed the Ice Kingdom.The rest of the \"wonderland\" wasn't that appealing to us. It was mostly carnival rides and midway games. The Christmas market sold mostly mass produced items, and not handicrafts like we've seen in traditional German Christmas markets. There were quite a few food stalls, mostly on the pricey side. We split one sausage, and opted to have dinner once we got back to our hotel. There was also a German beer hall. We didn't go on any of the rides as we weren't really interested, and as others have stated, the prices were high. It was interesting to see, but if we're in London again over Christmas/New Year's we will skip going again"

From a distance the attractions looked great, but on arrival we realised the Winter Wonderland is actually just a fairground. And a super expensive fairground. Minimum ride price \u00a34 for a pre-schoolers merry-go-round...the sort of thing you'd normally feel a bit ripped-off paying \u00a31.50 for. Anyway, we had booked for the Ice Sculptures so had to go in....this is where the endless queuing started...lots of waiting around. Not much fun, and definitely not 'magical'!!The Ice Sculptures were pretty good..however inside more queuing for the ice slide, and then waiting for people to have their picture taken by the official photographer (why anyone would pay \u00a38 for a souvenir photo was beyond me) made it all tedious. Such a shame as it could have been a lovely experience.All in all too commercial - felt like a one-stop rip-off. Oh yes, paying \u00a36 for 3 sweet laces from the sweet stall was a final reminder of why we wouldn't recommend this attraction to any sane, normal family!!!"

We visited on the 30th December mainly for a birthday treat but also because we thought it wouldn't be as busy as before Christmas - boy were we wrong !! Everyone had to walk around the park in one direction because it was that packed with people. Couldn't see what was being displayed on the stalls in the Christmas Market. Had to pay \u00a34.00 for a hot dog but instead of having real onions all they had were dried crispy onions ????. We didn't take any children ourselves, however my sisters took their daughters, and were charged \u00a34 for the children to go on the fairground rides and adults were charged \u00a36 for rides. We booked in advance to go on the Observation Wheel so we wouldn't have to queue when we got there, but after 20 minutes of queueing (and with aching feet !!) we finally were able to board the wheel. Am now able to tell people that I have finally visited the Winter Wonderland but can also say that I definately won't be visiting again, a very disappointing birthday treat and to be honest a big disappointment all round."

Never again and really glad we hadn't pre-booked any of the special attractions. It was absolutely heaving with people and being short with two kids we couldn't see a thing!! There are much nicer places to ice skate ie Somerset House and Westfields shopping centre and you can go on fair rides anywhere. The couple of fair like stalls we went on were between \u00a33 and \u00a35 a time and the queues for other rides were very long. I do not like overly commercial attractions andIi know others who have thoroughly enjoyed this place but I just think there are much better places to go in London at Christmas time. The Eye had no queues and the stalls along the embankment were just as pretty but you could actually get to them!! Best part you don't have to pay to get in but hey just rip you off once you are."

We then went into the Bavarian bar that was also fantastic atmosphere and the drink were'nt over priced either which we was expecting so even better. We stayed on park till it closed then went to watch the fireworks over the thames which was great. Best new year we have had in a long time will be doing it again.

Don't go down the ice slide at the side of the ice palace unless u want a very wet bum for the rest of the day.

I don't know what they have done, but it was REALLY AWFUL & TACKY. They have TOTALLY ruined what was once a really delight.\u2022 It's lost it's authenticity. Many stalls are brands in disguise. Many of the hot chocolate stalls are actually Galaxy chocolate stalls. Jamie Oliver had a stall. Haribo sweets had stalls everywhere.We struggled to find any of the proper German stalls that were there before, although the one we did find was good but amazingly expensive.\u2022 It's way way way too big now and seemed to keep repeating itself.\u2022 It used to sell really interesting handcrafted goods, traditional wooden decorations, tin toys etc. Although there were one of two fo these, from what we could see few of these remain and now you will find lots of circus stalls, beer tents, fridge magnets and tacky plastic rubbish at extortionate prices.\u2022 It's very very expensive. \u00a34 for a mulled wine, \u00a37.50 for sourkraut, 1 sausage and potatoes. \u00a35 for a German Sausage (just a sausage, no sourkraut).\u2022 It was packed, really packed to the point that it felt unsafe, especially with small kids.Because of all fo this the atmosphere has been lost. We found lot sof people were saying the same things as us which surprises considering the glowing reviews people have given it on this site.It may be better during the week when it's less busy, but we long for the Winter Wonderland of a few years ago which was about as close to a German Market as I've seen anywhere. Not the tacky mess/large funfair with stalls made to look slightly German selling complete tat that it has become.If you like funfairs, or Disneyland, or the 02 centre then you will probably enjoy it. If you want to go because you have been before and like German markets, then like us you will probably hate it.We wont go again, which is a shame as it was once so very good."

There are many places to eat and drink - don't walk into the first place you see take time to wonder around a bit. They also had free live music at various places in the fair and we watched the very good Houndogs roackabilly band while drinking mulled wine (you can get plenty of other drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). We didn't go into any of the circus events or ice skating so can't comment on them.It was very busy on the Friday evening we went though easy enough to walk around. Taking a pram around there might be slightly challenging with the crowds but not impossible. The prices charged for food and rides are probably not extortionate but it can add up when rides are around \u00a34 each, a quarterpounder with cheese is \u00a35 and mulled wine is \u00a34 a cup.There are gift stalls were you can buy various Christmas related gifts. Overall I did enjoy the atmosphere and it was well organised. There are rides for different age groups including a whole area for toddlers and faster white knuckle rides for teenagers and adults - especially the overhead zip wire which is quite frightening. You could spend many hours there if you wanted to trying lots of the attractions like the circus show, rides and ice skating."

You obviously can't take bags on the ice but I feel that after having paid for a ticket you shouldn't then have to pay more to leave your bag somewhere! And let's face it nearly all of us carry junk around with us!! The whole process of getting skates was efficient. In the centre of the ice rink there was a singer which was really nice :)The stalls: The stalls mainly sell over priced food - but I never expected it to be cheap. Cheap fairgrounds do not exist! All of the stalls sell much of the same thing, particularly mulled wine.The rides: a token system operates. We paid six pounds each (daylight robbery!) to go on some spinny chair things up in the air.The crowds: It was busy when we arrived at about five in the afternoon but once it began to rain the crowds died down. Note that there is hardly any shelter.Toilets: think I only saw one lot of toilets so hold on!!Age group: ice skating appeals to all ages but I think children under 12 wouldn't be thrilled as the stalls and rides are more aimed at adults in my opinion.Will I return? I'd ice skate here again and I'm glad I've been but I wouldn't rush back."

WHERE?We schlepped in from Winchester for the afternoon expecting a Winter Wonderland of family fun and were sadly disappointed.Instead of a winter wonderland of white and calm, we found ourselves amongst a sea of people pushing and shoving their way around a huge fair ground. If we were expecting a fair ground we would have been very happy as it's a great fair ground.Lots of great looking rides, lots of beer halls, and food stalls, loud uncordinated music blaring from every direction; long lines of people waiting to buy tokens to spend on rides, very few places to sit and eat, and lots of very crowded drinking areas.Winter Wonderland implies Christmas, fun and cheer, family friendly activities.The walk to the area is pitch black, and felt unsafe in many ways. We thoroughly enjoyed walking thru the Christmas Markets as we left.it's not somewhere we would recommend anyone with kids under 12 years go ..... and if you've teenagers and they want to go with friends, follow them."

The market stalls are lovely and they sell freshly made goodies. There is no need to eat before you go as there are so many food stalls.

Winter wonderland is a magical place, it has something for everyone!There are several areas - there is the craft area as you come in that has many craft stalls, laid out well and uniformly presented. There are the bars towards the back - I like the Bavarian Beer Hall but if you would like a romantic date, go to the carousel bar (it is actually built like a carousel with the horses spinning around you.) The rides are fantastic too - there seems to be more and more with each year, howevber if you wish to use the rides they will set you back about \u00a36 per person and the best time to go is during the day as queues at night are mental. I went with my girlfriend and my parents and had an absolutely fantastic time - the only thing to be cautious of is how much everything costs, as long as you are prepared that every drink will cost between \u00a34 and \u00a310 (for a stein) and that every ride will cost between \u00a36 - \u00a312 you will have a fantastic time!"

We went to the circus & The Magical Ice Kingdom. Both are worth the money, but you have to pre-book online. They loved all the rides & food. I enjoyed the stalls in the Angel Market area. By post lunch it was very crowded & difficult to move around w/ the pram. However, we were never in a rush & everyone was friendly; we tried to be respectful of people going by. The queues weren't that bad either; hardly waited for anything we wanted to do. You have to expect crowds on a nice day in the middle of London at such a cool event. Plenty of stalls for mulled wine, got chocolate, & beer. only found one with mulled cider. Only complaints are that everything was definitely overpriced, so our fun day was more expensive than I would have liked. My son was jipped 1 token in change when I sent him on a ride; such a shame a 5-year old would be taken advantage of like that. I don't understand why they didn't spread it out a little more considering the park is so big."

There is also a wide variety of other eateries such as a Jamie Oliver stand selling pork in a bap.There are loads of things to see and do at Winter Wonderland but you need to pre-book. So I would suggest checking out their website and making a booking.Although its free entry, you will end up spending money! So I would say take at least \u00a312 per person minimum \u2013 and that\u2019s just for eating and drinking. Its all cash mainly as well."

I was a little dissapointed that there wasn't more of a christmas village of little stalls and shops to look in- there's a couple scattered around, and then a row of them by the entrance- but it was nearley impossible to look at any of them, because it was so congested near the entrance and exits.At around 11am it wasn't too busy except near the entrance, but later in the day it was horrible- you couldn't get anywhere, and too many people had brought buggies with them, causing road blocks and bashing the back of your legs with them trying to push through. They also closed the tube station as it got so busy. We went off for a walk around the lake, and enjoyed that much more than the winter wonderland!"

Last year we learnt that if you want to visit any of the attractions inside then you will need to book. And so this year we did book the Circus three weeks in advance.The best way to get to WW is from Hyde Park Corner Tube Station as this is only a few feet from the attraction. It is free to get in but they make their money on lots of things inside the enclosure. Soft drinks, such as water or fizzy drinks are around \u00a32 each and a beer is about \u00a35 a pint. There are lots of stalls selling all these drinks as well as Mulled Wine and the like, so dont worry about stopping at the first you get to as they are all pretty much the same. As for food, this is also quite expensive with a medium chips being \u00a34 and a burger being \u00a36.If you know this before you head out there you wont be in for such a surprise and the quality of the food is actually ok, for what it is.At the moment (December 2012) there are so many people going to the site that they are having to only allow a certain number of people in at a time and 4pm-7pm seems to be the busiest times (families etc). Also, once in, you will have to queue for pretty much everything so please be patient !!When you leave, I suggest walking back to Embankment, Waterloo or Trafalgar Square, all are within 20 minutes walk and all are safe to get to. It will also stop you from having to beat the crowds to the tube."

We had been to Harrods earlier and found the Knightsbridge tube station to be well signposted and less than 10mins walk away.The atmosphere is so festive and is a feast on all of your Senses- look at all of the lights and open fires,, listen o the Christmas songs and live music, smell the gingerbread, candles and incense and taste the mulled wine.We spent \u00a38 on a trip on the Ferris wheel which was lovely. As it wasn't busy we were. Given a pod to ourselves and you can choose different Christmas songs to be played. The view was great. Then we spent \u00a35 on a glass of mulled wine with a shot of amaretto in one of the German bars which was very strong and warming.It wasn't busy at all when we want- no queues for anything. I would certainly take my kids back when they're a little older. The only thing is the price of the gifts for sale is expensive and can be bought more cheaply elsewhere."

The fairground part was so noisy and ridiculously expensive - not easily affordable for most families. The pre-bookable events were very pricey too. The circus was ok - a bit of fun and my 10 year old daughter enjoyed that. The Ice Kingdom was nicely done but so small, much less than I was expecting. Hundreds of food stalls - ok, all selliing the same type of thing. The craft stalls had some nice products and we did buy a couple of Christmas presents but many of the stalls were difficut to get at because of the crowds. All in all it was a let down, when we had been hoping it was going to be an exciting start to the festive season. I won't go again.If you must go, visit on a week day if you are able to take your children out of school and avoid the rides unless you have good ear plugs and money to burn!"

My family (2 adults, 2 children of 12 and 10) got tickets to the Zippo's circus in Hyde Park's Winter Wonderland last Saturday night at 2100. We arrived well beforehand - hopefully for a spot of on the hoof dinner and a wander around the stalls. The whole area was heaving with people - thousands of visitors pushing and shoving and it was almost impossible to walk - what turned out to be quite a distance - to the circus tent. On the way we managed to grab a German sausage and a couple of glasses of mulled wine (which we needed in the end!) but we had no time, with the huge crowd, to look at any of the stalls, nevermind go on any rides (which looked very expensive anyway). I'm glad we didn't book to go ice-skating since that was very busy too - far too many people had been let in in my opinion.It took us over half an hour to get from the entrance to the Circus tent, and when we got there it was organised chaos. We were eventually shepherded around the back of the tent after the supposed 2100 start time - and by the time we got to the back entrance, everyone else had used the front entrance, chosen their seats and we were left right to one side and at the back - so our view of the high wire was impeded. The show lasted about 45 mins - but was very average apart from 4 motorbikes whizzing around a small cage for a few minutes. Random evil white witch / bride was a bit of a waste of space. The monkey men would have been better without masks I think - though what they did was quite clever. We came out, tired, fed up and faced with a long walk back to the tube. I piggy-backed my 12 year old (who has walking difficulties) most of the way. Both children were very disappointed and pronounced the evening a #fail.We won't return. Too many people. Too expensive. Not much fun at all in the evening."

Only two good events/acts rest was utterly stupid. The ice sculptures were amazing but not worth the cost for 15 minutes or less..The Big Wheel was worth the money.. The Bavarian Bar area where the bands were performing was a fantastic atmosphere. (careful of pick pockets so I heard) Very crowded on Weekend When we were ready to leave (they closed Hyde park tube due to crowd control) it was hard to find Green Park tube and quite a long walk away if you have children. All I can say is you really are better off not taking buggy's WAIT until your Children are a little older!!! You would enjoy it much better without them..it was total chaos for us with one child of 6 yrs (no push chair) The crowds were very thick.. 10 pounds for a large stein of Beer (2.00) of that is deposit..or 4 pounds for cup of beer."

            "review": "Winter Wonderland, Hyde Park London. We visited Winter Wonderland on 30/11/2012 as a group of 4 adults and my 3 year old son, we traveled via tube and we got off at Hyde Park Corner tube station which has steps and a slope (perfect for pushchairs etc) and was a 2 minute walk to Winter Wonderland, we arrived just before midday and walked straight in with no queuing. I found this was a great time to go as the park was not overly busy or crowded at all at that time. Tokens which you buy for the rides are \u00a31 each, and each ride is 2-3 tokens average for the children's smaller rides, and the adult rides are average 6 tokens per person per ride, so for 2 adults it works out that you pay \u00a312 per ride average. It is best to try and work out how many tokens you need first as these can't be refunded at the end of your visit and are only valid for the day you buy them on, and the fair type stalls (e.g hook a duck etc) are cash only they do not accept tokens and these cost about \u00a33 a go. We visited the \"Santa Land\" area first which is aimed at younger children with a great variety of rides and stalls for little ones, queuing time was minimal for the rides and on some there was no waiting time at all. This is where you see Father Christmas but the queue was very big so we gave that a miss. There are loads of places to eat and drink around Winter Wonderland with minimal queues at each, although they are mostly outside, we chose to eat at an indoor restaurant which was German themed although they did have English dishes available, I opted for chicken and chips which was pricey at \u00a312 and a small glass of water was \u00a32, so if you have a family of 4-5 it will work out very expensive, but we were in the warm and the service was brilliant and and the food was lovely and a good portion size and just to be able to warm up for a while it was worth the money! I don't think the other food outlets were quite as expensive but you will be sitting outside in the cold to eat, you can also buy crepes etc at various points around the park and these are between \u00a33-5 each depending on your filling! There are lots \"mobile\" type toilets around the park, not horrible port-a-loos! We did not have to queue at all for the toilet. The baby changing facilities are also in a \"mobile\" with about 5 tables in each and each table had a changing mat on, the baby changing \"mobile\" is fantastic, enough room to fit everyone in, did not smell at all and it was heated so lovely and warm, perfect for changing little one's in without worrying about them getting cold. The ground at the park was easy to push a pushchair around on, we did not have to go over grass at all. The market is fantastic lots of different stalls, pricey but some interesting stuff. There was a few stages that had live bands on as it was getting towards evening. There is also a nice big undercover fire that is great for warming up around and you can get a drink from the bar there. We left the park at around 7pm and by this time it had started to get alot busier and alot more crowded. My advice if you are going with young children would be to go earlier in the day as my son managed to get on everything he wanted to without waiting and the adults also got to go on a couple of rides with minimal queue time and it was comfortable to walk about at that time with no crowds. All in all we had a fantastic time and will be back again next year!"

The whole atmosphere is amazing and looks fantastic especially at night. We visited saturday night and Sunday all day. Staying over in a Hotel within walking distance. It rained quite alot and was very muddy and big puddles every where, so would recommend you wear wellies. But this in no way spoilt the fun. I visited with my 11 year old son and 12 year old Grandson. There are so many rides that would satisfy any adrenaline junkie, there fantastic far to many to mention. Watching people on the zip wire was hilarious as they hung above you. There is a minimum weight for this depending on weather conditions, Unfortunately we were not able to use this. But the kids found plenty of other rides to enjoy and scare there selves silly. We visited both the circus's, Magical ice kingdom and ice skating, (not one of my best ideas), as i was rubbish, but funny all the same, There were many others gripping on to the side trying not to fall over. The evening circus is worth a visit just to see the motor bikes. All the shows are very cheap and worth a visit. The fair rides how ever are not cheap. They ranged from \u00a34 to \u00a37 each. The zip wire being \u00a310. So needless to say we spent a small fortune. Would be very helpful if the web site published this. So visitors can plan better for there budget before arriving. There were plenty of food out lets and the churos were delicious. Smothered in chocolate sauce. There are places to enjoy a drink and one bar had live music. We didn't have time to sit and enjoy this. We found all the staff very helpful and polite that we spoke to. if fiances allow we shall visit again next year. Having visited the once I think Ill be giving the kids a budget next year.!!! I would Highly recommend a visit. There really is something for every one to enjoy. Should you decide to visit I hope you have as much fun as we did. MERRY CHRISTMAS."

I love Hyde Park in the Spring and Summer but have never visited in the winter, so was excited to hear that they were staging a Winterwonderland whilst I was in London recently. Unfortunately, the event was so popular that the tube station staff at both Hyde Park Corner and Green Park were unable to cope with the amount of people wanting to visit. We were instructed to get off of the tube at Green Park and walk to Hyde Park, not normally a problem but in the dark and torrential rain, it became a nightmare. Once at Hyde Park, we waded through mud to get to the event. Everything on sale was overpriced and although the little wooden huts were pretty and would have looked nice with snow on, in the dark and rain everything became a little bit sad looking. We had a cup of mulled wine and some chips with dipping sauce - this turned out to be a tray of chips with a choice of tomato sauce or salad cream - not really what we could call dipping sauce in the UK. The winterwonderland experience is really just a large fairground attraction with some expensive food and drink stalls and a few typically overpriced Christmas market stalls too. We left within an hour and tried to get on the tube at Hyde Park Corner, which was not possible due to the amount of people on the trains themselves. We ended up detouring onto another line altogether, travelling all around London to get back to where we eventually needed to be."

This is a large park and if you manage a sunny day,a Borris bike is a splendid way to explore. Don't forget that Kensington, Harrods, the Royal Albert hall, the Albert memorial and the great British museums are all accessible from the park. OK, let's talk about the Winter Wonderland event. It's going to be busy and at peek times transport will be a nightmare. The underground service can get overwhelmed and often the stations will just close down until the backlog of passengers clear. At these times you will also find the buses are clogged and taxis all taken. The reason this event gets so busy is because it's free and really the only big Christmas event in London. So what do you get for your free ticket? Lots of sheds dressed up to look Christmassy and selling an underwhelming selection of hot sticky, gooy stuff. There's beer and sausages, hot chocolate, and toffee apples. When you have managed to negotiate the many sheds, you will arrive at the sort of events area. Here you will find an ice rink where you will be allowed to stumble round on the ice for a princely sum and asked to leave the arena after a not so princely amount of time. Then the circus, a tent with children's entertainment, always heavily booked. And then the fun fair. Good selection of rides, from quite hairy to little kids. Lots o kiosks selling more sticky gooey stuff. I must say that at night, with all the coloured lights and Christmassy decorations, you might manage a magical moment, but this will quickly disperse when you check your wallet later. The traders here are certainly not afraid of charging top dollar. If you want to experience this event, keep well away from weekends, make sure the kids have eaten before you go and limit the time you spend. Brisk walk round and get out. There's so much to do in London, so don't get caught with the 'Christmas must have for the kids ' stuff, Take care, Pedroofpobla"

This park is well known for its free speech corner & street artists so, if u feel like something is bottling up inside you just go there & let it all out & share it to people. Some cool concerts are staged there too especially in summer. This park is ideal for family picnic, lovers & strollers as it is close by the shopping districts of Oxford street, Bond street & Harrods are within walking distance tho' this park can be too vast to explore while doing some shopping. The last time l was there, l only went around it on a double-decker bus from Trafalgar Square on my way to Oxford street. l could see a lot of people chilling out on its grass under green canopies because it was summer in 1997. It is worth a visit!."

Firstly, I would like to say its FREE to get in, and boy, did we enjoy it, except for the rain lol. We booked the Ice Skating, Zippos Cirque circus and the big wheel (lovely views) a couple of days before we went (on their website) as we felt it would be busy, and it was. The boys thoroughly enjoyed it, so did we. My daughter and I liked the Xmas market, full of unusual things and goodies. There is also a large fun-fair, a bit pricey but good. There is loads of stalls to eat and drink, at reasonable prices. Give it a go, u will enjoy it and its open till 10pm."

Walking from Piccadilly Circus we entered the park and went over to the Achilles monument(photo op) and carried on through towards the serpentine lake and to the Palace The Park is huge with isolated areas of attractions. Half the park is huge empty fields and its pretty flat. The sites they do have are scattered and some what not worth the visit unless you have a full day to lend to the park.The main attractions that should be visited is a nice visit to Albert Memorial where you get nice view of the hall and the statue. Then make your way over to the pond for a relaxing moment of feeding the ducks and finally cut over to main attraction which is the Kensington Palace. If you plan on doing the entire park do plan for atleast 6-8 hours plus plan on bringing a lunch or find a snack area near the serpentine lake.I would say that one should not take more then 2-3 hours and just hit the Albert hall, Pond for a quick light snack and the Palace. The rest of the park is just a huge park.As far best park in the world...I still have to give that to Central Park."

The main paths are very wide and flanked by trees which allows pedestrians and cyclists to use it together easily. There were also occasional small places to buy refreshments.We walked the full length of the park and down before turning towards the Serpentine. The walk was considerable but well worth it. It was a lovely lake to walk around with plenty of water birds such as Cormorants which I must admit to not having seen before.Last but certainly not least I need to mention the squirrels. They are cheeky to say the least and come charging towards anyone that comes along. I held out my fingers to tease one to come closer so that my girlfriend could take a picture. When I held my hands up the squirrel didn't stop and ran up my leg towards my arm to look for food. I won't do that again as its claws were sharp!A great park and very relaxing.

The areas around the Park are orderly , posh and historic .I stayed in the Victory Services Club on the Seymour Street near the Marble Arch while in London and spent about two to three hours in the morning every day in the Park. I liked the concept of bikers pedaling around the electric bikes, the riders on some of the most beautifully groomed horses trotting by , the joggers jogging past with ear phones, the casual sitters on the benches who had grabbed a sandwich from the Pret and Manger across the street . THE WHOLE place is very very atmospheric . The sign postings make going around easy and with three tube stations around the Park , coming here is very easy. The restaurant by the Serpentine Lake and the lake itself within the Park was lovely . Every corner had an element of surprise and there were so many areas to explore. The Lady Diana memorial , the Regent Park , the famous Exhibition Road with all the famous museums are all accessible through the Hyde Park . I reckon the layout of the European Part of Kolkata ( Then Calcutta) towards the East of Fort William upto Park Street and Chowringhee was inspired by the areas around the Hyde Park .Calcutta incidentally was the second biggest city of the British Empire after London . I stuck up very lively conversation with people from many nationalities there. You have the police, the ambulances and volunteers of the National Health Services to handle any kind of emergency . To me the HYDE PARK is as iconic as the London Bridge and the Big Ben. A must go destination if one is in London. All citizens of the Commonwealth countries will find London to be one of the best cities in the whole world as their modern character and heritage of the last 200 years is invariably linked to this historic city ."

My wife and I only spent a short while here while we were on our trip but it was important to just see such a historic London park. We made it to the Serpentine on the south side. I would have liked to go to Speakers Corner, but didn't have the time. For anyone coming to London, I'd encourage you to spend some time in a London park such as Hyde just so you get away from the traffic and buildings of the city. And, by the way, we entered the park from the direction of Knightsbridge subway station, which also happens to be next to Harrod's department store.

It is a wonder that Britons have managed to keep a whole string of parks in the very centre of one of the most expensive cities in the world where the prices of land are sky-high. We should all congratulate them on that. Hyde park is excellently maintained: I saw people cleaning, watering etc. It is very versatile: open green meadows, century-old trees ( another achievement through the ages), flowers, bushes...you name it. I saw Rotten Row where people can enjoy horse-riding which is another attraction of the park. The Serpentine creates the impression of a sea-coast and it has also the waterfowl to enliven the scene. There are benches everywhere and they are a perfect place to relax after the crowded streets, shops and avenues of the gigantic city. There were very few people and I really got the impression that I am somewhere in the English countryside--a wonderful feeling because I do not like big cities at all. I could not see everything for lack of time ( and the park is enormous) but if I go to London some day again, I will make sure to visit Hyde Park again."

The road that bisects the park is closed to vehicular traffic on Sundays. You can take a leisurely stroll on the Serpentine. There is a huge pond replete with geese, swans, and other resident birds. Hyde Park is also home to the Princess Diana Memeorial Fountain and a childrens playground built in her honor. There are paddle boats available for rental, should you want to venture onto the pond. Food and beverages are available on the grounds. The park also has a small gift shop. The vibrant colors of the changing of the seasons cannot be beat. It is a great place to exercise, take a slow stroll, or pull up a bench and people watch. Hyde Park is very close to a great shopping area that is home to two London landmark stores - Harrods and Harvey Nichols. Very pedestrian friendly."

My mum and I spent one of our last afternoons in London cycling around Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens using the TFL City Cycle. I probably cannot emphasise enough how lovely and enjoyable this was. After the hustle and bustle of London non-stop for 6 days, it was so nice to take it easy (and get some exercise as well). We hopped off the underground at Hyde Park Corner and picked up two bikes at the first entrance we found to the park. There was a bit of a queue and some confusion about how to use the hire machine (some people didn't have credit cards - this is a must), but once we had our bikes, we were ready to go!We cycled around both Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, stopping off to look at monuments as we went. Mum and I were in London in May, so it was still light at 6pm when we went and the Park was full of people relaxing on the grass. The only thing to watch is the parts of the Park where bikes are not allowed. Usually this is on the narrow tracks up to memorials. On the whole, this wasn't much of an inconvenience.I recommend visiting the Round Pond, Peter Pan Statue, Princess Diana Memorial Fountain and 7 July Memorial. Hiring two bikes for 2 hours cost 6 pounds. Without hiring bikes, we would not have had the opportunity to see so much of Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens."

If you have something to eat in one of the many temporary snack bars which offer different styles of ethnic foods and drinks you can walk off some of the calories though the park to Marble Arch underground station. You could divert to see the Princes Diana memorial."

The park was packed with people having picnics, cyclists, horse riders, skaters, dogs and everyone was making the most of the wonderful weather. We decided to be brave and instead of the usual pedalo decided to take a row boat out on the Serpentine. At \u00a310.00 pp it's not exactly cheap, but we spent a fantastic hour rowing around the lake - definitely something I would recommend! We then had a late lunch on the terrace of the Serpentine Bar & Kitchen (reviewed separately but was wonderful!) followed by a couple of hours sat on the grass watching the skaters and their tricks. This is definitely something to see and they really are amazing at what they do, basically it's free music & entertainment! Hyde Park is huge and you can rent a bike fairly cheaply to get around or simply walk for hours. Squirrels and birds abound and you can feed the swans & geese on the lake. You can actually even swim in the lake in a large segregated area but when we were there the queue was huge! The gardens and statues are beautiful and you could definitely spend the whole day there - we will definitely be making a regular return!"

I became a bit tired, and that was even with part of the park closed off the day before the Springstein concert. So, I didn't see all of it, but what I did see was fantastic. My only disappointment was \"Speaker's Corner.\" I was under the impression that someone was speaking there all the time. It was a bit of a downer to find it empty, but it was nice to have the education.The walkways/bikeways seem endless. I don't think I've ever seen a people appreciate and use their greenspace quite like the Brits! It is refreshing. Enjoy!"

We first stopped by the Speakers Corner which can be used for persons who wishes to debate or for public speaking. I was informed by a guide that in the early days this spot was used for public hanging. During the London Olympics 2012 the Serpentine river was used as part of the Triathlon and this was televised worldwide. In this park we saw a lot of people on bikes, some jogging, some having picnics. You can get food to buy at the park and there is a fountain there that is a memorial for Princess Diana. Go ahead and take your family to Hyde Park, you'll love it."

They are really heavy and I'm afraid to say not designed for the feminine shape ...... but we got a good look around Hyde Park and whizzed along the cycle paths avoiding pedestrians and children who don't seem to know what a picture of a bike on the tarmac means! It is years since I have been to Hyde Park, and I'd forgotten how big it is. Lovely lakes, plenty of restaurants, felt very safe and gave a great view of London.

We were persuaded to join our daughters in Hyde Park to soak up some of the Olympic Atmosphere but sadly I thought it was a shambles. Crossing the road to Hyde Park reminded me of school as there were attendants helping the public cross - honestly how stupid do they think we are? There are crossings and some of us work in London all year and manage to cross roads without help.Entry to the park may be free but you cannot take food or drink inside so anyone with a family planning to spend the day could spend a fortune. There were the inevitable queues to get in.Once in the Park we were treated to the wood chip covering that has been necessary because of the effects of recent bad weather and crowds on the grass. The park has been given over to the corporate sponsors and looks nothing like a green and tranquil Royal Park. We found a spot and set down to watch the athletics on the larger of the screens...about 30 minutes in the screen was turned off and some unknown to us TV presenter appeared and on came McFly (boy band). I'm sure their fans appreciated this but most people were there to see the Olympics. What the organisers didn't seem to have taken into consideration was that all those who wanted to see the Olympics were then starting to move to the smaller screens -potentially causing a crush situation. The sports fans made their statement when we all stood at one of the smaller screens as the National Anthem was played for one our medal winners.We left via the Green Park exit where a number of stewards with megaphones were shouting at all and sundry 'Get out of the cycle lane' if so much as a toe strayed over the line. Such a pity they weren't remidning cyclists to dismount at the end of the cycle path....On the plus side there are lots of loos and they have running water and there is drinking water provided free."

Sure, there was no snow, which could have really improved the ambience, but the festival itself was a whole lot of fun. It was packed with people, there were many rides and many stalls selling beautiful Christmas decorations - and so much yummy food from many different cultures. We loved drinking the hot mulled wine, the rich hot chocolates, and tasting all of the foods. We all bought hats (as if we didn't have enough for our trip) - but they were so cute and wouldn't take up THAT much space in our packs.Sure, this is incredibly busy, incredibly crowded and expensive.... but when you come from somewhere that does not have a winter Christmas market, it is something that must be seen and must be done. We visited several times and loved the whole thing (and did I mention the ice skating). Would I visit again? Definitely - next time we travel to London, I would love it to be during winter again, so we can once again visit Winter Wonderland."

There are scattered groups of people listening and interacting on a variety of topics. You can stroll around and see what interests you. Usual topics seem to be politics and religion. If you come in the middle of someone's talk/speech/tirade, it might take awhile to find out what their point is. Sometimes it is very serious and impassioned, and sometimes it is very humorous. Worth a look. You don't see it quite like this in other cities."

My only disappointment was the Lady Diana Memorial Fountain ...... what a poor attempt at a Memorial for someone so well loved. A fountain............is it really a fountain?? Anyway, we hired the bikes at a very reasonable price as our time was limited which was a great way to see the Park. We would like to spend more time here, walking and maybe hiring a boat, on our next visit to London. Highly recommend visitors to London spending time in this wonderful Park.

It's massive. You can wander into some places and feel like you are out in the English country side. A few years back, we stayed in a holiday rental flat a stones throw from the park. We spent many days there, with our young son. It was a great place for him to play and run and play with sticks and rocks, watch ducks and geese, see people running and biking. He loved playing at the Diana Memorial Park, and there was a carousel set up near Kensington Palace that he just couldn't stop watching. My best experience there was Hard Rock Calling a few years ago. The park made an amazing music festival venue, and plays host to a number of them throughout the year. There was plenty of room, it felt like a festival out in the countryside, and the event was well organized. Overall, yes, Hyde Park is a great place to go and visit in London. ."

You can get the 'Boris Bike' and go around the park or further away if you are feeling brave. There are at least 2 cycle docks, use your credit card and cycle away. One thing to remember is that if you use the temporaray pass to unlock your cycle the number pads on the docks do not always work. I had to try and get 4 temporary passes at use them at 2 different docks, but let that not deter you as it will most likely work in the end and the cycling is really lovely and worth the effort. Good fun and good for your heart and healt too. Get up and go...but beware the english weather choose a nice sunny day and you will never forget the experience."

Yes, there are dinky little pedalos for hire though I've never risked it. There's so much space that even in the height of summer you can find somewhere agreeably far enough away from other human beings under the shadow of a tree. There are cafes-all of which are very good though occasionally crowded-and some fascinating historical sites (Kensington Gardens, Apsley House) for those of a historical disposition. Don't miss it. Seeing the park through the starboard window of your 747 or A300 on one of your many circuits before landing at Heathrow is no substitute for visiting, so now there's no excuse..."

If you like wildlife then there is plenty to see - even a swan on it's nest near the Lido. What we like is the variation in Scenery from open Parkland through to the Dell below the Serpentine and the more formal gardens towards Hyde Park Corner. We were impressed by the number of TFL bike stations now located around the park and will be tempted to try out this excellent way of getting around the whole area at a later date. Since we last visited some years back there are many more little 'huts' selling coffee but we headed to 'The Lido' and were amazed to find the price reasonable and the coffee good!"

There are a lot of birds near the water, and also information and pictures of them so that you can learn about the birdlife. The trees were so beautiful and the gardens had just started to bloom, wonferful park to visit in the springtime!Tip: Don't forget to bring your best walking shoes, because, as I wrote earlier, this is a huge park!SummaryPositive things:- Gardens really taken care of- Clean- Several places to eat- Good information (signposts and information about the local wildlife)- Public toilets- No charge- A lot of activitiesNegative things:- Some people are walking their dogs without a leash, which might be scary if you are afraid of dogs- Might be crowded during days with sunny weather- Cars are allowed to drive in the park (only in the outskirts, but it still ruins a bit of the impression)"

When the weather is fine - you will feel like you are in heaven!So many things to see and do within Hyde Park - take a boat on the Serpentine, picnic on its expanse of lush grass, visit Speakers' Corner and statues aplenty, including a stunning gold one commisioned by Queen Victoria for her late husband Albert at the south of the park - which looks out onto the Royal Albert Hall. If you are staying close to Notting Hill this is a perfect cut through to Chelsea/Knightsbridge. Breaks the walk up :o)"

I like Hyde Park's sheer size, variety and the Rose Garden most. As it's BiG a (hire) bicycle is the best way to get about and to select a place to picnic, or grab a bite to eat. London has the so-called municipal 'Boris Bikes' so you may want to rent one for a few hours and deposit it wherever you find yourself upon completion. Hyde Park' is good for all ages, extremely safe and a relaxing way to absorb the local flavour and locale."

Feel free to join in and argue with the speaker. This takes place on Sundays.In the Serpentine, you can both swim at the Lido and take a boat trip.We love walking through the park on a sunny day. Bring some food and have a lovely picnic in the sun, or in the shade of a big tree.In the winter, there is, or was a few years ago at least, the Winter Wonderland fun fair, with rides, a skating rink etc. etc.Cross over into the adjoining Kensington Gardens and visit Princess Diana\u00b4s Memorial Playground, a place our kids love to visit. It features a pirate ship and a water area, where children can go wild."

Entertaining but Pricey. www.hydeparkwinterwonderland.com/Our group consisted of 3 adults and 5 young children so purchased 2 family tickets online, in advance. (Highly recommended or you will pay more and spend longer queing). Booking attractions in advance also reduces confusion and indecision on the day over what to to/where to go. We visited on the evening of 29/12/11. The venue looked great at night with all the lights etc and great atmosphere. Snow would have been magical... However, we arrived in the middle of a rainstorm :(Entrance is free, great if you just want to wander round and pay-as-you go. We had booked the 'wheel' an alternative to the 'London Eye' (a downgrade though, reflected in the price) and Zippos Circus Extreme. The 'Wheel' didn't have a scheduled time so arriving at 5pm gave enough time to queue for that, after which we purchased hot dogs and hot chocolate! This saved the day as it was extremely cold & we got caught in a terrible rain storm whilst queuing. Then made our way to the Circus which started at 7pm. You are advised to arrive 20 mins prior to start time in order to get good seating. The kids loved both events. We padded out some time before and after by purchasing 'Tokens' for fair ground rides. But be warned...this venue is extremely costly if you don't plan and budget well in advance! I'd been warned about a parent who'd spent \u00a340 in 20 minutes - easily done when a regular portion of chips for one costs \u00a34.00. Take snacks/drinks for kids... then limit the treats! If budget isn't an issue then there's an abundance of choice from stalls to bars & restaurant type facilities.PROS: \"If you're looking for great Christmas Market and traditional fayre then this is the place for you. There's also a skating rink (can't comment as didn't visit it), plenty of places to eat and music and entertainment in abundance. Something for everyone, adults & children alike\"CONS: \"Book events in advance. Pre-booking will reduce or may avoid queuing altogether. But don't over-book as you may run out of time. Wear warm clothes and protection from the elements = rain!. (if you book the 'Wheel' and it's torrential downpour, you won't see a thing). Budget well and stick to it if with children. Choose where you by refreshments carefully - if you hunt around you will find 1 or 2 reasonable stalls but most are costly. Be prepared for a crowded and busy venue.\""

It covers 350 acres in central London and hosts such events as concerts, triathlons, festivals etc. The easiest tube stations to access it from are Hyde Park Corner, Marble Arch, Lancaster Gate and Knightsbridge, so it is extremely accessible. It\u2019s probably most famous for The Serpentine Lake and Speakers Corner. The lake is a lovely place to spend time in both winter and summer and there is always an activity going on there. Speakers Corner is very famous and it is always interesting to see what topic is being talked about on a given day.I still think the best way to enjoy the park is just strolling through wondering down the paths and in the summer, taking a picnic and having a lazy afternoon watching the world go by. For a cheap and relaxing day in London, a walk through Hyde Park is perfect."

Overall we had a really good time, however I'd recommend visiting this attraction in the morning, as by noon it was packed to the point people couldn't really move and there was a long wait to even get in, and in the evening, it was even worse (there was an hour wait just to get in)."

Firstly prior to our visit I tried to check out the details on their website, but each time I tried the site froze and I was not able to proceed. I tried on two different computers so I don't think it was my end.Arriving at Knightsbridge tube station there was a map which showed us how to get to Hyde Park but there was nothing indicating that the Winter Wonderland was taking place, nor how to get to it. We set out with optimism and it took us about 10 minutes of walking, mainly around an area of the park that was under construction. If it had not been for the big wheel we would never have spotted where the event was.Upon arrival we stopped for something to eat, the chorros with hot chocolate were delicious but messy. A good start but after that the event disappointed. It is mainly a very tacky fairground, with rides costing between \u00a34 and \u00a36 per person. The circus which we might have visited was only performing in the late afternoon / evening and as we were morning guests we missed this opportunity. The ice rink looked good, well run and not too crowded. We stood and watched for 10 minutes or so and everybody appeared to be enjoying themselves. After this we walked through to the Christmas Market and again were very disappointed, A heavy concentration of food stalls and silly hat stalls, very little else on offer, some jewellery, candles, crafts but in the minority.We had planned to spend the day here, at least 4-5 hours, in the end we stayed a little over an hour.It might have been better after dark when you couldn't see the tacky side so much.Although it is free entry, you will be expected to part with a lot of money after that."

This being so, the Power Tower offers an altitudinous thrill at a relatively modest \u00a36, while the helter skelter and ice rink are well worth a punt. My advice: take the kids, avoid the expensive food and drink on pain of death and bring sharpened elbows. Liam Gallagher was there when I visited and seemed to adopting this philosophy.

People watching all around the lakes and the Diana water feature especially is fun and it's not far to head to Knightsbridge, Oxford Street, Kensington or Queesnway depending on which corner you end up in. Sundays is always fun with Speakers corner and the arts and crafts stalls that line Bayswater Road. Best of all it's all free.

And remember, the Speakers Corner area only comes alive on Sundays, It's easy to spot the crowds. We usually shop ourselves out along Oxford Street, then takeaway food and head towards the park. Just great to flop on your own patch of grass, munch leisurely, and people-watch. Strolling around Hyde Park takes a while."

It has lots of squirrels and people on the grass resting or reading. It's really amazing. The only difficult thing was to fin the Princess Diana Memorial, its not very well indicated and the Memorial isn't very beautiful, at least we were expecting to see something more like Princess Diana."

We've visited Central Park in New York City and Golden Gate Park in San Francisco so spending the day in another great city park sounded like fun. Unfortunately we found trash strewn from where we entered at Speaker's Corner all the way to The Serpentine and the trash cans filled (we actually wondered if it was normal for people to leave their picnic trash in a pile on the lawn and the trash guy would come pick it up?). When we tried to sit somewhere besides on the ground with the trash, we were asked to pay 1.50 by an attendant or move along. When we did sit on the grass we were attacked by ants, so we decided to walk around The Serpentine Lake instead.When we arrived at The Serpentine we could see the water was dirty with things floating in it and signs placed round the perimeter that advised the water was contaminated with blue green algea. They clearly warned that contact with the water could cause diarrhea, skin rash, intestinal problems, vomiting, cramps, etc. So we skipped Serpentine Lake and walked around the lake to the Diana Fountain. On the way I stopped to take a picture of a small pond and waterfall, then realized the water had trash and plastic bottles floating in it. It would have been a very nice picture.The Diana Fountain was a highlight, but it was filled with adults and children so actually seeing the fountain and surrounding area was difficult. This is probably normal for July, but I expected a Memorial with a few kids splashing, not a giant wading pool so filled to capacity with adults and kids that the fountain itself was obscured. I imagine it is beautiful in the winter.The park does look like it has great sports facilities for a variety of sports (including horses), skills and ages which I'm sure London residents really enjoy. We did take a baseball so the boys played catch on the lawn for awhile so that was fun, as was getting ice cream from the ice cream truck, but in the end, we were glad to leave and don't plan on going back."

I was taking pictures of a monument in Hyde Park Corner when a funny looking man spotted me and introduced himself as a visitor from Italy. He asked me to take a picture of him with his camera and selected a relatively isolated place for background image. I took his picture, then he came to me asking something on a map. During this, two more men (probably foreigners) came from nowhere (from behind the trees I mean). One took out a police badge on his wallet and waived it on me and asked for my belongings (We all know Police in UK has a uniform and is quite courteous). He took my wallet and smelled it and searched thoroughly (luckily I did not have much foreign exchange.. at the most 50 GB Pounds). Then he directly asked me if I had US dollars etc. I told him I had none and they let me go. I am sure that had I kept more, they would have ripped me of it... It is all so spontaneous that you are left with little or no time to react."

Although we had booked out slot for skating, there was still quite a wait and the rink was very very crowded. The food and drinks are very expensive and there are few bargains among the market stalls although many of them were interesting and sold beautiful things. On the whole it is worth a visit perhaps just to wander around and browse."

We went to Hyde Park several times and the kids loved it...lots of room to run and play, a few bathrooms here and there (all nicely hidden by shrubbery), and in the center of it all is the Serpentine lake. Apparently you can swim in it - we did not (but our 4 yr old took a dip in Round Pond quite by accident - quite amusing!) - but the paddle boats are a great way to spend an hour on the water. There is also a very large Ferris wheel that is great fun, unless like me you have a HUGE fear of heights! Speakers Corner is in one, um, corner of the park and good to check out. And I went running around the park once in the late afternoon- was a fantastic ~4-5 miles that you can shorten or stretch by the route you pick. If you're a careful planner, you can pick out the drinking fountains too. So overall, you really should spend some time meandering around the park, if you have kids, bring them...or go for a run. Truly, it is one of the great city parks of the world!"

Yes, I agree it can be a little pricey but this is no standard funfair attraction. With beer halls and oopah bands for the adults and Santa and the elves for the kids, it really works for all ages. The rides are excellent and different from your standard waltzer/carousel affair (although both are there too) and the whole place is full of Christmas cheer. I've taken my kids twice and although they went on a couple of the rides, they mainly enjoyed the whole festive scene and they got to see Santa too (for free). The highlights for me was the fabulous Talking Tree (hilarious and also free) the Christmas Market is also very good and sells quality gifts rather than the usual tat some Christmas Market's tend to knock out, the hat stall was especially welcome on the day I went, as it was snowing. The second time was to go to Zippo's circus which I though. Although the show is shorter than the standard performances (50mins) it was festively themed, funny and very well done. For around \u00a36 a ticket you can't complain. Plus it was warm, dry and my kids (8 and 5) absolutely loved it, especially the death-defying acrobats.I hope Winter Wonderland is a regular London winter fixture, it's great!"

After viewing the winter wonderland website page and speaking to a number of other people who had visited we decided to take a trip here on sunday 12th december. We pre booked tickets for the circus at 5.00pm and arrived at around 2.00pm. It was absolutely rammed with people, thousands! We certainly expected a lot of people but not to this extent. You could not move or walk faster than the pace of a snail and you could not stop to look at any stalls because you just had to keep moving with the crowd or you were literally pushed by the people behind. One woman was collapsed unconcious on the floor and the crowd just literally stepped over her and carried on. There were probably 10 different stalls just repeated over and over again around the park and the prices were fairly expensive. As I said before, we did glance over at them as we shuffled past but could not stop.We spent 20 minutes walking a matter of metres to the toilets and then we had to queue for one hour just to get in!In the end we flogged our circus tickets for a reduced price because we could not stand the thought of waiting for the circus here and we left.It was then hell trying to get on the Hyde Park Corner underground due to the crowds and it took us another hour and a lot of pushing to eventually get on it to leave.Please take my advice and give this one a miss, we were really looking forward to it and it turned out to be the worst day out we have ever had and so stressful!"

You buy tokens for the rides which were a pound each.Most rides are 3 or more tokens each person. We let the kids choose their favourite ride and for four of us to go on it came to \u00a319 . The second ride was the dodgems at \u00a35 a car . Wait times for rides were fairly short but hardly surprising at those prices. As we are on a faily tight budget we called it a day after that only pausing for a hot drink ( \u00a33.50 for a hot chocolate ! Even at London prices this was alot. ) I had looked online at the prices for the big wheel , circus and skating before we went and found those expensive so didn't bother. As I read it , for the circus ,you buy tickets for a 50 min show and select your show time but still have to be early as it is first come first served.I think 6 of us would have been \u00a355 and the waiting around would have taken a big chunk out of the afternoon.I loved seeing the kids laughing at the talking tree which is near the big wheel and there is a good atmosphere but not sure how they can justify the high prices."

But by the time we reached the Albert Memorial, the sun was setting (around 4 pm) and we started heading back the other direction towards our hotel. By the time we reached one of the north gates, it was LOCKED! We searched for another exit and it too was LOCKED! We didn't have a choice but climb over the tall fencing. Felt like we were breaking out of a prison.

I know that sounds really cheesy but it is true. I recommend it for young couples who just want to be together but don't necessarilly have that much money.
