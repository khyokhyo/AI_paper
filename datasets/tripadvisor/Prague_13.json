TIP: if you are going to try the Old Town Ham!.. make sure to clearly state you want a SMALL piece or no more than 200g!.. or you WILL be given about 500g and charged about \u20ac15!!.. if they give you large piece insist on small or walk away! TIP: keep wallets and purses safe!TIP: don't eat at the restaurants in the square unless you want bad service, poor quality food and expensive price!.. walk down the side streets just a minute or two and enjoy the many good restaurants TIP: go up the tower to get a great view"

My disadvantage was my inability to get first hand information from a qualified guide , and so for the amount of waiting one has to do to see the short display , it was a let down .What one should marvel though is the thought and science applied a long time ago to make something work so precisely .It's said the clock doesn't stop ."

Yes, like the Charles Bridge it will probably be overcrowded between June and September, and no it might not be as colorful as the Piazza San Marco in Venezia or special as other squares like Times Square, Piccadilly Circus, La Concorde which are of course of really different styles ...

It is a good place to eat, with both restaurants and stalls with all kinds of local food produce. For a few days there was some kind of fair with stalls selling various goods as well as entertainment. The Square is fringed with shops, including a confectionary place which has a small museum and has demonstrations (with free tastings) of making chocolate. It also sells a greater variety of sweets than I have ever seen. Vendors sell tickets for tours, or hire our segways. There are several old churches and one has animated figures every hour. It is well worth a visit while in Prague even if you are not staying in the area. It is also central to the shopping area which has a wide range of goods, including crystal and glassware as well as other notable local manufactured goods."

Although it was the beginning of autumn, the twelveth century square was filled with tourists, cameras at the ready, all snapping away at the lovely architecture, and pastel shaded buildings surrounding the area, and the church steeples towering high above. Stop and enjoy a coffee, or a beer, at one of the many restaurants and watch the world go by. So much history here!"

Fortunately, Prague was lightly bombed during WWII, so most of the buildings, some from the thirteen hundreds, are still standing and well preserved. A wonderful example are the churches and buildings around the square. I suggest that you arrive there about 15 minutes prior to the hour so you can view the oldest working astrological clock do its thing on the hour. It is a fascinating contraption. Just follow the crowd. Otherwise, spend some time in the cafes on the perimeter of the square and relax in the arms of history."

There were gun shots fired, people screaming and running and men in ISIS garb with a flag resembling the group and no one to speak English and explain to tourists that it was in fact a demonstration and not a real terror attack. That spoilt my opinion of the square on the day but it has since been improved and is a beautiful place to \"Czech out\" :)"

Nevertheless, try and find time to just sit and soak up the atmosphere, and make sure you cover the whole square as there is so much to see. There are various forms of street entertainers, food stalls, horse drawn carriage rides, and buskers, and despite the hubbub it always felt safe as there is a plenty of police presence. A must is obviously the astronomical clock, but try and make time to go to the top of the Old Town Hall itself, (there is a lift), where the views are just amazing.Make this your starting point of your stay in Prague,and you won't go far wrong, as you can certainly get your bearings of the city better once you have visited here."

We were there on a sunny mid September day and the square was packed with tourists and perhaps a few locals. Gosh it was busy!We bought a dessert treat from a vendor that we realized later was rather expensive and not worth the calories. We stopped at a souvenir shop and bought a small trinket for a collector friend. It felt like we were such a bother. Usually being a tourist is so much fun but sometimes it's not. It was our first day in Prague and I felt mildly disappointed. We were there for five days and things improved and we loved the Old Town area. We often found ourselves at the Square and often because we'd become lost in the maze of winding streets. I think all roads lead to the Square! We avoided the food vendors and put off buying any more souvenirs until our last day. Prague is a beautiful and vibrant city! We loved being there. The Old Town Square is the heart of it all and definitely worth a visit."

Do note, though, that even in mid-September it was swarming with tourists, tours, touts and, no doubt, assorted malefactors.To start with an overview, spend a bit of tome in the middle of the square anf just look. An amazing variety of architectural styles are visible in and around the plaza, from romanesque to high gothic through renaissance, baroque and so on.The Jan Huss memorial, huge in the center of the open space, dominates. Read the three paragraphs your travel book has about him and his movement, a proto-protestant immensely memorialized in this very Roman Catholic country, which burned him at the stake for his pains.In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, this section of Prague was a gathering place for artists, writers, scientists and musicians. Many of them hung out around the Old Town Square. Note particularly the building where Einstein gathered with fellow student friends to puzzle out the foundations of modern physics.The astronomical clock and its various displays, located just to the side of the remaining bit of the old town hall, is too astonishing for a brief review. Read about it in your travel guide, which should have a photograph near the text; understanding requres a bit of study. If spectacle is all you want, be there with the others in their thousands at noon for the show: mechanical figures, all highly symbolic, doing their assorted things. The clockworks are many hundreds of years old, and with repair and maintenance, remain operative to this day.The best quality garnet shops in the city are just off the Square. We looked at the sights, perused garnets and moldavite, bought, and sank gratefully into chairs for lunch at Ristorante Anna, a nice and moderately priced spot on the street with the garnet shops.Old Prague in a conveniently packaged stop; a must-see."

It's great to see, but that's all there was to do (except for cafes, pubs etc.). See it and then move onto something else I suppose. We weren't there for the sights as you can imagine, but we appreciated it all the same. If you're in Prague, you may as well go to Old Town Square."

The 1st 7 days were on the Emerald Sun, one of the river boats of the Emerald Waterways fleet, going down the Danube from Nuremberg to Budapest. The cruise was outstanding in every way, and I would highly recommend Emerald Waterways. At the end of our cruise we spent 3 nights in Prague (got there by charter bus through Emerald) and fell in love with Old Town, and Old Town Square. We enjoyed sitting at the outdoor cafe's, eating, drinking, and people watching...Prague for me was the highlight of my trip to Europe, and to be honest I really wasn't all that excited about going to Europe in the 1st place. We always felt safe everywhere we went...during the day and at night also. Prague didn't get bombed during WW II so it is in pristine condition. Old town is the oldest section of Prague, and there is nothing like it in this country. Most, if not all of the buildings in Old Town are older than any in the US. I highly recommend a visit!"

You have to be there to experience it. We went there in Autumn and the atmosphere added a loveliness to the architecture of the place. Be ready to walk around because there are a lot of surprises in the alleys of Old Town Square. If you get tired, there is a foot massage place right there. Dont forget to try their trdelnik."

Backpack back to front. Go in a close knit group. A spot to absorb and photograph."

I guess it depends on one's luck. Every building is worth staring at for minutes. There are small streets and passages that would probably take you to yet another interesting location everywhere. A lot of expensive cafes available in the area, I suggest simply walking a few minutes into the less crowded old streets to find exactly the same menu with better prices and sometimes even quality"

The Old Town Square is simply buzzing with life and boasts one of the most magnificent sculptures you will ever see. The sculpture depicts the Czech hero who defied the corruption of the then Catholic church to found the roots of Protestantism across Europe (or at least that was the lone form the guide which sounded true). The old clock in the square is a marvel of horology and has a following of hundreds of people milling in the crowd each time it strikes the hour. The four figures are death, avarice, envy, debauchery, ( I think) who are challenged every hour by the twelve apostles. The clock dates from 1401 and still works so a great piece of engineering. Grab a seat at a bar and just enjoy the life of the place. "

In regards to food avoid eating around the square , take the side streets or eat in the old Jewish quarter . Out tour guide was very nice to tell us that Prague sees millions of tourists every year and the restaurants in the square know this and don't offer service , try to add extra money on the bill and basically takes advantage of the tourists knowing they are not coming back. If you want to buy an ice cream or a sausage no problem but sit down dinners should be away from the square. Will post some restaurants shortly. "

You can sit down in the local pubs and bars restaurants, which sell local beers which are very nice and great value for money. Night life normally starts around 8pm which the city transforms into place of fun and excitement. There are a mixture of cultures in this city due to high tourism.

The restaurants on the square are up to three times more expensive than anywhere else for the same menu.3. The square is constantly criss-crossed by touts on segways - watch where you're going.

Avoid peak times - you won't get near any of the buildings and may have to wait for an 89-person guided tour to pass.Other than all the above - truly impressive."

You have a selection of restaurants (be wary it is a tourist trap and the prices will be more expensive and if you find their service to be rude you may find extra charges on your bill such as bread and condiments!) and the clock tower and other historical buildings. It is a great centre point to start and then make your way down the winding alleyways. Another tourist trap you will see a few meters down from the clock tower. You will find stalls where they are selling ham on the rotisserie. The seller decides how much ham you get and the price you see advertised is per weight so if the seller is feeling lucky you could end up with 1kg of ham at the expense of your bank account! Be very wary."

Plan enough time to visit the square if you plan to visit many places within the square. Our visit to the top of Astronomical clock itself took couple hours (1.5 hour of it was spent waiting in line to go up).The surrounding during Christmas time is just wonderful disregard you visited this square in the morning, afternoon or evening. There are may stalls selling food, drinks and Christmas decorations.We stayed in Old Town Square for three days overlooking huge Christmas tree with blue synchronized lights matching the Christmas songs played. If you wake up early enough to get to the square (before 7 am), you can enjoy the huge Christmas tree and its surrounding without the crowd. Then go to Charles Bridge and go across it while it still early in the morning and the bridge not having too many visitors."

I love Prague...all my reviews clearly indicate this. Old Town Square is mostly walking only with very little street access for cars. I needed transportation to get back to the Four Seasons from Old Town and I was financially accosted by a taxi driver. They got me at the airport, so once I got into Prague I used Uber. Please use Uber. Uber\u2026is all credit card, you have a picture of the driver and you never have to worry about currency. I'm sure there are wonderful taxi drivers in Prague...I never found them. I over paid significantly on Taxi rides--no credit cards--cash only. Until you understand the Czech currency, using a Taxi is an expensive adventure. When we were dropped off from the airport to our hotel, I gave the driver his fair in US money. He looked like he won the lottery. When I got stuck in Old Town Square, the driver could see I was a single woman, frantic and stuck. He not willing to speak to me, then said no to all my questions regarding payment. I had to get cash from a random cash machine and it only gave me 500 Koruna\u2014 it was then, he agreed to drive me. I had been in Prague long enough to know he was taking advantage of me. He took me the longest way possible from Old Town Square to the Four Seasons. Finally I get to the hotel and he wanted some of the fair in Koruna and some in Dollars. I was running so late that I didn't even bother making change...I just gave him the 500 K. I was annoyed because I had given him a huge tip by their currency standards. I had no option but to pay his expensive fair. Be warned."

If you are looking for a vacation that includes over-crowded tourist areas (don't expect to find Prague natives here), rip-off exchange bureaus, over-priced restaurants, antique car rides in cars that aren't antique, then this is the place for you. Honestly I went there twice: for a stop at Starbucks because I was desperate for ice coffee, and because my walking tour originated there. Go a few blocks in any direction to find a more pleasant atmosphere."

A very attractive square in the heart of Prague, this area is a focal point for old-style buildings, cathedrals, historic statues and parks, cobbled streets and much more. Must-see attractions here include the Prague astronomical clock, the remains of the old town hall, statue of Jan Hus, church of Our Lady before Tyn and St. Nicholas Church. There is plenty of great entertainment acts to be seen here throughout the day as well as a great number of cafes, bars and restaurants in the square and surrounding streets. Great atmosphere at night as well with large crowds viewing the nighttime attractions. The only reservations I would have about the square are the close shaves with an over-abundance of reckless Segway drivers during the day and the very noisy stag and hen parties which throng the square in the night. Also, if walking around the the square (and the city centre as a whole) at night, you will almost definitely be approached by dodgy characters standing by their own asking if \"you are okay\". Pretty obvious to everyone what they selling, and not even subtle about it either. An unfortunate side to night-time Prague which does bring down the square"

We got the impression there was some sort of clock worth seeing. Not knowing what we were looking for, we walked some (beautiful) circles and almost actually missed it! The square itself is huge, there are many tourists but it's so open it didn't feel crowded, and it's all very clean and friendly. There were street performers and magical giant bubbles. Then we found the clock, just off the square. Everywhere else Prague felt quiet and spacious with wide streets and not a stag do in sight on a Sunday afternoon. Apparently every tourist in Prague was looking at the clock. Every time we walked past it there were what looked like several thousand people with selfie sticks waiting to see a skeleton dance on the hour. The clock itself is stunning and bizarre, I've never seen anything like it before."

The buildings that surround this square are 600-700 years old and are dominated by the Old Town Hall Tower (great view over the city), the Astronomical Clock (a major tourist photo opportunity), Church of Our Lady Before Tyn and St Nicholas Church. There are also large numbers of restaurants and shops that encircle the square. While we were there, Prague was having a music festival so we were also able to view and listen to the folk music and dancing from our room at the Grand Hotel Praha which was directly across from the Astronomical Clock and with a clear view of the stage and parade area. The parade consisted of over a hundred costumed musicians and dancers from all over the Czech Republic, surrounding countries, Mexico (a mariachi band) and even a large contingent representing Vietnam. This square is also where you can get a \"free\" 3 hour walking tour of the city (you pay what you feel the tour was worth).

There are always some activities for young children to play and evacuate their youth energy.This is not only a simple square or plazza but it is one of the major places for social interactions and learn.Whenever you'd have an extra time, just hang out arround this place in every part of 24 hours a day."

This ancient marvel puts on an amazing display of movement and sounds every hour. As we stood there mesmerized, our guide told us to beware of pickpockets. None in our group had any problem, however. Personally, I use a small leather card carrier that I got from a cruise with one credit card, a copy of my passport and some local currency. I then use a large safety pin to attach it to the inside of a front pocket. In 6 European trips through many countries and dozens of towns notorious for pickpockets, I have not been pickpocketed.....so far!"

The Catholic Church, Protestant church, Astronomical clock, fabulous sculpture right in the center, cobbled streets, romantic horse carts, gourmet food stalls, lovely faces and a soothing weather..That's Old town square for you..and a lot more than that.If the old town is the heart of Prague, old Town square is definitely the heartbeat. Cannot afford NOT to be here."

Everyone who visited Prague will surely come by this place for a walking tour, for shopping, for food or just to immerse in this lively and vibrancy city. There are so much to do here and the only problem one will face is whether he/she has sufficient time to spend here or not.After walking across the Charles Bridge (leading from the new town to here), you will find rows of shophouses in many small lanes (that look similar) selling all kinds of things catering to the needs of everyone. Besides souvenir shops, money-changers, common things sold here include fashion, shoes, bags, jewelry, cosmetics etc, besides cafes, restaurants, pubs and fast food chains. You will have a hard time deciding what to eat/drink, what to buy etc as so many options to choose from.Standing right in the center was the well-known Astronomical Clock, the iconic landmark here. Further in, you will see museums, theatres, open-air market (Havel's Market), makeshift stalls, boutiques etc. And there were also street performers doing magic or bubbling acts, singing etc. Very lively and full of activities here! (please refer to my earlier reviews of these places here too)Well, the place was indeed touristy and visitors here were more from foreign lands than locals. But it may still be a good place to get to know and understand the local culture, lifestyle and people.Word of Caution! Like any other cities in the world that attracted large crowds of visitors, do pay close attention of your personal belongings as pickpockets like to operate in these places to pry for targets especially foreigners."

The architecture here is awesome with so many beautiful buildings and the Astronomical Clock has to be one of the most photographed buildings in Prague.This really is a major tourist destination and as such their is a multitude of pubs ,bars and restaurants catering for all tastes and prices but be warned the price in some of these establishment's will seriously damage your wallet. As this is Pragues number one attraction and is a beacon for the tourists be aware that pickpockets are in operation so take sensible precautions but that said Prague is a super safe city.A great area and well worth checking out.

It's super nice (especially if it's sunny) and there are some great little restaurants and things to stop for lunch or a quick drink (even at reasonable prices). That being said, be aware of the tourist traps. We went to one restaurant and ended up leaving because the menu we received once sat down was different to that which we had read outside the restaurant when deciding whether to eat there or not. It didn't look different, but the prices had been increased by a markup of 50% (without us being informed, sneaky...) apparently because that's the additional fee for sitting outside. Be wary, also, of the Prague ham stalls - the prices are per 100g, but when I asked for some I got a 500g+ slice. Don't get me wrong, it's super good ham and I wasn't that upset about it, but I saw a few people who were, so just be prepared or ask before you receive a piece :)"

A beefy, bearded guy was garbed in a pink dress and veil. A line of guys in matching T-shirts were chanting catcalls. A crowd had surrounded the spectacle and tossed in their own (humorous) insults. The pink-clad guy laughed and strutted around encouraging everyone to chant louder. (See accompanying photo.) Nearby were two guys dressed in what appeared to be brown monks\u2019 clothing. One \u201csat\u201d in midair above the other. Each held onto a bamboo pole. (See accompanying photo.) Near the church, a violin soloist performed magnificently. Everywhere there were performers, like a loosely organized street fair. There are bars and restaurants with sidewalk tables, so that you can enjoy a brew and the performers\u2019 antics. Walk in any direction and there are phenomenal examples of architecture. I enjoyed the entire afternoon here, after visiting the Jewish Quarter, Charles Bridge, Powder Tower, and a boat ride on the Vltava River.

Had an ice cream treat at a sidewalk cafe. And found a very easy place to catch a cab. Enjoyed it greatly."

There's so much to see here, such as the Astronomical Clock, and so much LIFE.

First, be warned that walking up to the castle is a steep climb. Take the tram if walking a steep incline on the cobblestone streets is an issue. There are actually several buildings to visit and you can buy tickets to all or some. However I read here that they were all overrated. There are huge crowds, so we just looked from the outside and enjoyed the amazing views. You can go in the cathedral and get a general feel for free unless you just HAVE to tour everything close and personal. There is a changing of the guard every hour of that kind of thing is exciting to you. The best tip was to go quickly to the palace gardens. They are amazing! Beautiful views. Almost no one is there. Well kept. So large! Great place to stroll. We came across a place where you could pay $4 and hold one of ten Eagles, owls, and Falcons. My son loved it. Great experience and the keepers were extremely friendly."

In the square you are surrounded by bars and cafes (some can be a little pricey but walk like 1 Street away and alot cheaper). You can go up the clock tower for peanuts and get great views of the square and the city. The main square had a variety of events take place in it free music public speaking and all sorts. You will not struggle to get hooked up with a segway tour here as they are everywhere. One of the best part of this square is its location it is incredibly central to all areas of prague it's a 10 min walk to wencelas square (shopping district) Charles Bridge and the Jewish quarter and loads more it's almost as though the square was built first and the city exploded out from here.Also helpful is there's a tourist information centre on the square for those looking to get the most out of prague "

The many beautiful Art Nouveau examples along the quiet streets close to the river really are extraordinary, with spectacular figural entrances & highly stylised Nouveau doorways. Away from the crowded town centre, the surrounding hills not only give fabulous views over the city, but have many interesting buildings to see."

The architecture of the churches, buildings, monuments, and the square itself relates its history and local significance, but the closer inspection and ground-level views reveal the life, the energy still flowing through the cobblestone streets. Take time to observe the Astronomical Clock; inspect the stone work and inset statuaries on the balcony-like facades; walk a circle (a very large circle at that) around the square to get a complete view. Stop at one of the cafe's for a Klaster, or Urquell; on a chilly day, have a seat in the sun, or if a bit too warm, there's plenty of seating in the tree-lined small park setting as well. Take in the street performers, or just people watch. Enter the churches (I found the Huttite Church particularly beautiful inside), or just shop (the world of shopping surrounds you on every street extending from the square). You're an easy walk to many of the city's historical treasures. Take it all in."

Located on top the Town Hall, with its hourly chime, the clock is a major tourist draw and has become an icon of sorts for Prague. Built in 1410, the clock indicates the phases of the moon, seasons and some Christian holidays as well. Colorful baroque houses, oodles of shops and restaurants, Gothic churches add to the lovely ambience of the popular tourist square located just between the famous Wenceslas Square and Charles Bridge. The viewing gallery on top of the Old Town Hall's tower offers magnificent views of Staromestsk\u00e9 N\u00e1mest\u00ed. A lovely way to spend the morning!"

We found that first thing in the morning or in the evening was the best time to visit. In the middle of the day there are huge crowds of people. Try to go in the morning and evening as the area has a different vibe at different times of the day. There are a couple of old churches that are worth the visit along with the astronomical clock. Lots of shops and restaurants. The Square is also where many of the tour companies will pick you up for your tours. One tip: There are several booths selling gifts and food. The booths selling Prague Ham list the price of the ham as 89 kc per 100g. That is about $3.70US to try 3.5 ounces. BUT, even though the price list does not say it, they try to force you to buy 400g, by saying that is the minimum that you can buy. That's almost one pound of meat for $15. I did notice that other people (read non-tourists) were purchasing smaller portions. We were not given that option even though I asked. Also, before you go, do your research on tipping and service charges."

With its ancient buildings and magnificent churches, this is one of the most beautiful historical sights in Europe.The wonderful sights on the square are the Old Town Hall Tower & Astronomical Clock & St. Nicholas Church. To soak up the beauty of the Old Town Square, sit back over a coffee or a cool beer at one of the pavement cafes at the square.

If you can ignore the segway tours and tourists in shorts, it feels like you stepped back through town. Prague wasn't bombed out during the World Wars like much of Europe was, and as a result the architecture is intact and absolutely stunning. Aim for daytime for best visibility to see the astronomical clock at the Old Town Hall in all its glory at the top of the hour.Try to wander through when there's enough light to see the details of the buildings. There are a lot of walking and segway tours going through with guides shouting to be heard, so you might actually catch some history even if you don't join a tour. Pick up a sweet, cinnamony trdeln\u00edk pastry from one of the many vendors to enjoy as you look around if you don't need your hands for a camera (though it's a great place for some amazing photos on a sunny day). Watching your purses, camera cases, etc is necessary and prudent as on my trip one friend found an outside pocket of her purse open even though she doesn't use that pocket and another found that her purse strap had been cut (luckily she was using a travel bag with wire, so her belongings were safe)."

We met them in the square and walked around a bit, it had a lot of nice restaurants around, but we didn't go in any of them. It was a cool place that I think everyone should go if they are in Prague."

Yes, yes, we all know about the astronomical clock viewed by thousands of persons every day, but if you want a real treat and are a history fan go inside the building by use of a door to the left of the clock and purchase your ticket for the guided English visit. The hall itself is now used for functions of the Prague mayor, but you will visit the chapel with plaques from the 1400's, you will see the historical Council hall and the Municipal hall with its staircase leading to the medieval prison where the Bohemian rebels who lost at the battle of White Mountain spent their last hours before being executed by the Habsburg Emperor in 1621. Walk through the Romanesque cellers 6-14 feet below street level which were also used to hold prisoners. The main vestibule in the Old Town Hall is decorated to celebrate the real and mythological history of Prague. You will also get an inside close-up of the apostles normally only viewed from the outside of the the astronomical clock. This is an hour well spent. p.s. make sure that you have the $$$ to pay for the use of the inside toilet since the lady on duty really \"went after\" a man who tried to use the facility without paying--great entertainment."

Here are Gothic spiers projecting on top of the Tyn church tower and most of the buildings are adorned in Baroque facades and you really feel you go 600 years back when you step onto the town square. The Square has always been a lively place, today it's one of the most popular parts of the town Both for Czechs and visitors from abroad, and offers plenty of restaurants, pubs, shops, entertainment, galleries and museums. The history goes back to 11th century when it served as a marketplace. It was known throughout whole Europe at that time. The Square began as a central marketplace I Prague. Within the next subsequent centuries buildings of Romanesque, Baroque and Gothic styles was built around the Square, and each of them had stories of rich merchants and intrigues. In the center Stands Jan Hus Monument raised on July 6 1915 to mark the 500 anniversary of his death. He was one of the forerunners of the Reformation and in 1415 he was accused of heretic, anathema to the Church and burned on the bonfire."

The most popular building on the square is the Town Hall (with the Astronomical Clock mentioned above) construction of which began in the 14th century. This building used as the base the house of buyer WOLFIN even from the 13th century. On the Old Town Square we can also see other very nice historic buildings - St. Nicholas church, House at the Stone Bell - the most precious Gothic House in Prague, Jan Hus Monument, House at the Golden Unicorn, Cathedral Mother of God, Pauline Monastery and many others. Surrounding the square you can walk the beautiful, ancient streets and you can feel whole history of Czech. This place has its special magic atmosphere in spring, summer, autumn as well as in winter.

One evening, we sat in a street restaurant opposite the Astronomical clock and waiting - with front row seats- for the clock to strike the hour! Highly recommended!You can see the Tyn Church, the Old Town Hall where you can climb up to the top of the Tower for an unprecedented view of the roof tops of Prague, the Jan Hus Memorial and St Nicholas Church. Enjoy a coffee at a pavement caf\u00e9 and just people watch. Perfect!"

Unfortunately, I was not given much of an opportunity to really explore the area due to an insufficient amount of time on our tour, but aesthetically speaking, it's gorgeous. I'd recommend it as a place to people watch, since there are SO many people around, and plenty of cafes with outdoor seating to grab a coffee or tea and watch the world go by. There was a wonderful Big Band-esk group performing while we were there that sounded lovely. They made me wish my swing dancing partner was with me on the trip so we could bust out our moves, though that probably wouldn't have been the best idea on the cobblestones. I'm sure on a nicer day, there would have been more street performers there that would have been equally as good.Oh, and definitely bring your camera because there's PLENTY to look at, like the 21 white crosses. Also, make sure you're there just before the top of the hour to get a good view of the Astronomical Clock. To be honest, the performance itself is a little overrated, but the fact that it's still working after all these centuries is pretty impressive. On top of that, it's quite a lovely clock.Although I was not a huge fan of Prague, I'd go back if just to better explore the square."

Visit the clock, walk through the ally ways, stop and have a coffee, fins somewhere out of the way, they are offer warmth and feeling you can not believe. Go up into the tower of the old city building. Have a meal, take in the sights and if you are lucky you will get to see it covered in snow, truly breathtaking."

I was there for the Easter markets with my girlfriend and it was truly a beautiful place to be. There's plenty of places to eat, fresh food to go all around and plenty of activity going on in the evenings. The only thing that's annoying are those petty drug dealers who stand and whisper weed and Coke as you walk by. Almost like Amsterdam. They don't hassle you though unless you stare at them, giving them the idea that you are a potential customer. It's a nice place to go for a stroll with your loved ones or friends overall. Don't miss out!"

It is surrounded by fantastic buildings, with a key attraction being the Old Town Hall (well worth going up the tower) and astronomical clock. It has a lot of hustle and bustle with street entertainers, bands, etc.As with any key area such as this, bars and restaurants can be a little more pricey, but the prices are clearly displayed, so at least you know what you're in for. This is true in most cases, although, as another reviewer pointed out - be wary of the 'Prague Ham' stalls. I too had a bad experience here. I just wanted a small portion to try it and this is what I asked for. They served me up a huge plate and were very pushy about buying beer with it. I mentioned that I asked for a small portion and pointed at the price, to which they replied very rudely \"well they are just guide prices, the portion is 500 grams, how can you expect us to sell a small amount\" - In total it was well over \u00a312 - which was the worst value I experienced for anything in Prague - I asked them to make it smaller and I didn't want the beer but they just got even more pushy so I just walked away. Sorry guys, you picked the wrong tourist to try and fleece. You don't have to look far to find great traditional food at very fair prices, so wander round.All in all, a fantastic place, up there with the best."

If you like to eat fish, try the Nordic resturant, good value and delicious."

The main tourist information centre is located on the square and a great place to start and start planning your visit. Eat away from the square. It is very touristy and the restaurants onor near the square are typically that. For better quality food, get to t some often side streets away from the square,All main streets will eventually lead to the square and a great meeting place and is used for major calendar events (e.g. Easter - square is packed with people food and celebration)."

Later in the day the area is swamped with tourists, tours, and in general is quite claustrophobic inducing near to clock tower. Keep your wits; watch for pickpockets. Also, head over to the statue area for a little more space. If you are looking for a quick drink or bite to eat check out the cute little kiosk-type stalls along the western perimeter street of Staromestsk\u00e9 namesti, right behind the astronomical clock tower. There are benches behind the stalls to sit and chat or plan the rest of your day/evening. The statue in the center of the square offers a nice photo opportunity, especially in the evening when everything is lit up and looking either westerly or to the east toward the Church of Our Lady Before Tyn.

This runs we were told form Easter to 3rd April \u2013 so we timed it well.There are so many places selling Grilovan\u00e9 Klob\u00e1sy (Grilled Sausages) \u2026 try the paprika ones \u2013 they are superb.There are also a great number of stalls selling the Czech Cinnamon Pastry-Trdelni, being rotated on large open coal fired \u2018grills\u2019The square is absolutely packed by late morning \u2013 if you want a good look go early or late.There are amazing photo opportunities almost every building is form 16th century - really is picturesque.The one pain is the number of Segway \u2018punters\u2019 , people selling Segway tours of Prague \u2013 these are in extreme abundance \u2013 and most are not regulated, not insured and many disperse as soon as police arrive - we also saw one bad accident with someone coming off a Segway \u2013 so be warned.One side of the square are the horse drawn carriages, if you want to pay 900 czk for 15mins then go for it, I think it very expensive.The \u2018mock\u2019 old fashioned cars are even more expensive.The famous mechanical clock goes through its animations .. and there are many hundreds of people who queue up in front of the clock to watch this \u2026\u2026. Honestly I thought it a significant anti-climax \u2026 and not worth the wait.Take any one of the myriad of streets that touch the square and you will find restaurants and coffee shops \u2026 and at much better prices than the ones on the square itself.If you visit Prague - you will keep finding yourself back at at the square."

We spent far more time than we had anticipated touring the old city, and almost always found ourselves returning to Old Town Square. There are always new things to see and new experiences in the square with street performers, food vendors, artisans and interactions with fellow visitors and locals, alike. The shops and restaurants around the square cater to all tastes and budgets, and the street acrobats and musicians are a delightful entertainment. Our visits to the square were enhanced by reading about the history that Prague, and the old town square, have witnessed. It was worth sitting and contemplating what the buildings and paving stones had seen and been touched by over centuries of pivotal events. Any visitor could spend a full day just touring and photographing the square. We look forward to our next visit to Prague, and will spend hours experiencing and enjoying this square at the heart of that beautiful, romantic and historic city!Jimmy and Catie Brown"

There was a large stage with lots of entertainment, from children's singing and dancing groups during the day to folk groups and a rock band at night. Famiies, teens and adults of all ages gathered and locals mixed well with the throngs of tourists that were there every day despite cool March weather. The famous astronomical clock is also on the Square and is a sight to see. While I didn't climb the tower, others with me did and said it was worth it to see the views but not very well-managed with crowds. The usual hucksters were out in force, especially annoying were those on Segways trying to entice people to take a two wheel tour. All in all it was lots of fun and I wouldn't have wanted to miss it"

If you can get a seat just rest a while whilst taking in the impressive architecture and colour around the square. I remember commenting on how quiet it was considering how many people were milling about. All we could hear was respectful conversation between people; no one running about or shouting or making a nuisance of themselves."

This is a lovely square ideal spot for taking photo's plenty of tourists about BUT BE WARNED please people be very wary of the Ham Vendors !! they will rip you off !!!! Look at the price list and make sure you confirm the price before you part with your hard earned cash I was massively overcharged !!! I stupidly paid over \u00a320 for a piece of ham and pot of pasta and bacon in what really should have only cost me around \u00a36 the vendor could see i was a bit bewildrerd and after handing over my money i was given a really sarcastic comment of ahhh its only money he knew i was confused and it was only later i relised i had been ripped off. These people are a disgrace to the good people of prague who are generally very honest nice polite people the authorities should do something about these scam merchants. if you do want to purchase a Ham please look at the price list and confirm a price first !!!!"

For 20 CZK you could buy some feed to give to the animals - and they know you're going to! There they were, a bunch of well fed, adorable, cuddly fellas. They totally stole my heart!I felt necessary to keep my bag close to me at all times, there is always a crowd and I've heard that pickpockets operate in area. We didn't see anything suspicious and all our belongigs were safe at the end of the day, so I feel that common sense is all you need. Don't keep your wallet in your back pocket, or your purse open.."

            "review": "The Old Town Square, Warsaw. The Old Town Market Place or Old Town Square is the true heart of the Old Town, and until the end of the 18th century was the heart of all of Warsaw. It originated in the late 13th century, at the same time that the city was founded. Here, the representatives of guilds and merchants met in the town hall (built before 1429, pulled down in 1817), and fairs and the occasional execution were held. The houses around it represented the Gothic style until the great fire of 1607, after which they were rebuilt in late-Renaissance style and eventually in late-Baroque style by Tylman Gamerski in 1701.The main feature at that time was the immense town hall, reconstructed in 1580 in the style of Polish mannerism by Antoneo de Ralia and again between 1620-1621. The architecture of the building was similar to many other structures of that type in Poland (e.g. the town hall in Szyd\u0142owiec). It was adorned with attics and four side towers. A clock tower, embellished with an arcade loggia, was covered with a bulbous spire typical for Warsaw mannerist architecture (an example being the Royal Castle).The district was damaged by the bombs of the German Luftwaffe during the Invasion of Poland (1939). The ancient Market Place was rebuilt in the 1950s, after having been totally destroyed by the German Army after the suppression of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. Today it is the major tourist attraction in Warsaw and is always very busy."

Beautiful architecture of several styles surrounds the square. But be warned according to a guide we used, the square is the favourite haunt of pick pockets, so hold on to your wallets and purses."

I just loved the old town square with all its historical buildings like the old town hall with its medieval astronomical clock\"Orloj\" which is still in operation with a parade of apostles on the hour, the Church of our Lady before Tyn, the Jan Hus Momment that commemorates a religious reformer burnt at the stake for his belief, the Salon of Mrs Berta Fanta where Einstein spent time, and all the food kiosks that sell Old Prague Ham and Trdelnik, Al fresco dining restaurants and street performers doing musical numbers and other stunts. Remember to go up the old town hall tower where you can get a panaromic view of the square and the surrounding areas which is definitely worth the while. For your reference, the Old Prague ham was sold at the kiosks for 89 Czech crowns per 100 gm and as it is supposed to be a local delicacy, I ordered a plate to try and it turned out that I was given more than 200gm paying close to 200 crowns and I was told they do not sell 100 gms as it was too little. I have to say that the ham looked better than it tasted as it was on the dry side and my advice is if you are not a solo traveller like myself, share one portion with your friend(s) just for the novelty. In fact, a very respectable entree like knuckle of pork at some of the restaurants at the square would only cost you around 250 crowns and you can sit down, relax, be served and enjoy leisurely the surrounding atmosphere. One last advice, do come to the Square at night time as well as the lit up buildings really looked gorgeous!"

The shopping is fabulos and with their dollar value compared to ours in Canada...it was very reasonable. The leather products are beautiful and like I say...very good in price. The evenings spent in Old Prague square with the romantic lights and music were definitely a hi-light however you got the feeling that some of the waiters didn't want to be at work. Lucky for us, we had a friendly one the last night of our stay which made for an awesome evening with wine and tapas. We went on a Segway tour which was worth the money and Anthony our tour guide took us all around the Castle which we probably wouldn't have walked up to because of distance and hills. Great fun for sure. We even found a billards place off the beaten path. The architecture throughout is stunning and although the cobblestones on the streets and sidewalks are sometimes tiring to walk on ... they are beautiful. We stopped to chat with some of the men doing repairs on them ... the older gents are the only ones working on the actual stone work as they are the sxperts. It's a dying trade unfortunately. We stayed at the 987hotel and it was about a 5min walk from Old town. Great place, service and had a full continental breakfast. It was right across from the train station but very quiet. Excellent hotel. Prague is or should be a definite on anyone's Bucket List."

Each day there would be somebody performing in the square which would draw some crowds.There also lots of guys on Segways punting for business around the square so just be prepared for that, however, exploring is easily done on foot. If you take one of the side streets by the restaurants & clock and keep going, you will reach the bottom of Wenceslas Square in about 10 minutes (if that)."

The clock does its thing on the hour and crowds will gather from about quarter to. See if you can identify the four great fears embodied by the static figures on the clock! Younger visitors might be underwhelmed by the clock, but in its day it was no doubt the last word in technology. Don't eat near the square; you'll pay a fortune, but as with so much of Prague if you walk a few metres you'll always find somewhere cheaper.

The greater part of this list are located close to the Old Town Square and even though this was a short trip, time in the Square was not wasted! There is the Astronomical Clock, which attracts crowds every hour. Behind the Town Hall and the clock. look to the right and the twin steeples of the Church Our Lady of Tyn tower over the building in front. Access is by a passage. It is well worth a visit and whilst it is open 10am - 12 Midday and 3pm - 5pm. There are postcards and guides in English, The Interior is magnificent and you will not be disappointed. There is still restoration work to be completed for the damage dome during the closing stages of World War Two. There is another Church, St. James, which is also impressive and unlike the Church Our Lady of Tyn, they allow photography, providing you do not use flash photography. The Square is very close to the Charles Bridge, an absolute must for every visitor to Prague"

It's a venue for some interesting additional events but some of these are REALLY LOUD.The whole square (and it's pretty big) tends to be very busy all the time - a real multitude of groups following guides holding up furled umbrellas / balloons / tasselled sticks / almost any form of identifier you can imagine. One side-effect of this is that group members tend not to look where they are going but watch the guide. Hence you get walked into rather a lot (thoughts of pickpocket technique although none seen or experienced personally and there are plenty of police patrolling). The main thing to watch out for are the vast numbers of very small tourists with umbrellas as these tend to be at exactly 'poke-your-eye-out' level ....... laughable not really not funny when it happens 30/40 times. So be warned.The actual Square is delightful, the Astronomic Clock well worth seeing (but don't go on-the-hour, it's so crowded that you'll probably not see anything at all). Caf\u00e9s are very, very popular and, while obviously tourist prices, still quite cheap by English standards. Better value away from the Clock, across the square (or 50 yards down one of the many sidestreets).Well worth visiting. Keep your hand on your wallet and the other hand guarding your eyes and you WILL enjoy it!"

As you trod the bridge, take time to contemplate Prague at its full, whether it be its spires (\"city of the 100 spires\"), St. Vito's Cathedral and the many castles known to dot Prague and the rest of the country. A paprika sausage washed down with a pilsner can't be a better complement to a Charles Bridge crossing."

Try a visit around 9:30am to get a feel for the place then come back during the evening and fight your way all the way to the tree. A must try is the Prague Ham, but it's served and costed by weight and the average weight is between 500 - 600gm at 80ck per 100g, so it's not cheap, but 1/2 kg of ham is enough for two or three people.

The Square is a very popular place and in December is home to some of the Christmas Markets where roasting chestnuts, Prague Ham, sausages of all kinds, crepes, mulled wines, beers, trdlenik, potato spirals and ginger breads are so plentiful.

You can almost feel yourself letting out a wistful sigh, as you'll know you'll never see another building more beautiful. With the 600 year old astronomical clock at the other end of the square (the oldest still working example in the world), you simply must make the time in your life to see this square.

However, it's worth a wander round, and also features the Old Town Hall (Stara Radnice, with a viewing tower and the famous medieval astronomical clock) so you can kill several birds with one stone. It's also very pretty and quieter at night so you might like to go through on your way to dinner. Unless you're wealthy, go a block or two away to get a drink though. The prices on the square are vastly inflated. Also, if you're waiting for or watching the Astronomical Clock do its thing - be on the watch-out for pickpockets."

The atmosphere is delightful, crowds notwithstanding, and there are plenty of restaurants around the edge (which are very willing to part you from your money) and tacky souvenir shops. The architecture is striking all around the square, so take the time to admire and appreciate it. Wander down the side streets that run off the square and absorb the sense of history. And get a good guide book or app so you can really appreciate what you see. Look beyond what is obvious, and it will enrich your experience."

We visited the city December 15 and were thoroughly impressed with the Xmas decorations, christmas tree and Xmas atmosphere. The tree took our breath away with how beautiful it looked in the evening with so many pretty decorations twinkling and shining. If Xmas in Prague old town square doesn't make y feel full of Xmas cheer then nothing will."

It was out first night in the city and we didn't really know what we were doing, so were ordered way more than we would have, but it was the best mistake we ever made.

It sells bio, veg food varities with enough seating place. Perfect spot for Vegans, Vegeterians (taste is a mix of Indian, Mediterranian cuisine) and average price.

I managed to cause enough of a stir for the price to instantly drop to 1150, which is still outrageous.

Once again Prague, for me, proves itself as one of the most lovely cities in the world but at Christmastime, the Old Town Square is a true fairyland of delightful smells and sights for the traveler. In the square one of the top Christmas markets blooms. I have been to many other markets and it is one of my favorites. The gigantic, amazingly lit tree and the craft booths set against the backdrop of Our Lady Before Tyn church and the surreal gingerbread of the other surrounding buildings are only surpassed by the smells and tastes of the food. I recommend the fried cheese on rye bread topped with mixed berry jam, potato dumplings sauteed with kraut and ham, meat and vegetable skewers, or the Prague ham itself. Wood smoke and spices permeate the air because much of the food is cooked over wood. It is very busy on December 5, Saint Nicholas Day, but if you brave the merry throng, you will be rewarded by the sight of the Saint and his companion devil and angel greeting children. The weather can be nippy but we were rewarded with beautiful clear days this time. Don't hesitate to go during the Advent period, you won't be sorry."

One word of warning; a lot of the hog roast stalls sell by weight, so some will load up the potatoes and big lump of fatty meat - price can go up very quickly! Otherwise prices are about half of what you pay at a Christmas market in Scotland, so get stuck in :-)"

I love the old cobbled streets: there is not many places left like that in the UK!Definitely worth a visit"

Although Prague has four main areas of interest - The Castle Quarter, Jewish Quarter, Old Town and New Town, the Old Town Square is by far my favourite. It is so beautiful, particularly at Christmas with its markets and huge Christmas tree! But at any time of the year it is definitely a place to visit-the Astronomical Clock is amazing and the buildings round the Square are breathtaking. You can sit outside and have a coffee, lunch or dinner here (even in December), although prices are higher than restaurants just round the corner. Photographers will also try and sell you a fridge magnet of you at dinner... But it's worth it! If you are a history buff, do the World War II tour and you get to go underground and explore under the Old Town Square!"

Lots of restaurants/bars surround the square and perfect for people watching while sipping a cold beer.

Amazing sights and smells with mulled wine, roasting hams and chestnuts, cinnamon squirls.

The Old Town Square is surrounded by affordable places to eat from local dishes served from kiosk's to Sit down formal restaurants. There is always lots going on from people offering Segway rides (it is fun watching people try Segway for the first time) to human statues. There is also some high end shops.The Old Town Square is a great place to start your break in Prague."

This clock is the third-oldest astronomical clock in the world and the oldest one still in operation. The cafes around the square are the best place to sit and watch street artists and musician perform and enjoy the afternoon, though they are somewhat expensive."

Even though this place is busy it's safe. We saw plenty of police around. In fact there are plenty of police everywhere which is great for us tourists....get to the Square it's worth it"

Completed in 1410, it is the third oldest astronomical clock in the world, and the oldest that still works. The Square is flanked by buildings, such as the medieval House at the Stone Bell, built in the second half of the 13th century. Next door is the Gothic church, Our Lady Before Tyn, which was built in the 14th-15th centuries. Opposite the Stone Bell House is a Rococo Palace, Kinsky Palace, which is a part of the National Gallery, Prague's amazing collection of fine art museums. The Square is surrounded by 700 years worth of architecture. Within the Square is a monument to Jan Hus. This is one of my favorite places in the world, and is something that must be seen on any trip to Prague."

Very good \"street\" entertainers - playing/shows for tips, horse drawn carriages, Segway tours, etc. You need to look beyond the hubbub a bit and take it in. The square is HUGE! So even though there are lots of people in the square, it doesn't seem crowded at all. There's no pressure from the performers, activity sales folks - all very low key. The surrounding architecture is beautiful! There are lots of caf\u00e9/bars to sit and enjoy the views and people watching. Performers are unique and high quality - great music.

Very flavoursome and moreish.With exception of Wine and the local donught/pretzel stalls behind the astronomical clock DO NOT buy from the ham/potato stalls as the prices they show are per g weight and they only sell portions which are at least 4 times the published prices - they DO NOT sell at the small 100g portions advertised in the prices. VERY EXPENSIVE for food in Prague as I calculated the 1 portion I bought as around \u00a310 for 3 lumps of ham, and 2 portions of the potatoe/cabbage/bacon as approx \u00a38. There are a number of alternative eating places where the food is good and inexpensive. All our evening meals were \u00a320-\u00a325 for 3 people including Beer/Wine."

Just off the square down the narrow cobbled streets are hundreds of cafes and bars in which to dine and drink the famous PIVO, Cech lager.

It's a great place to walk through, see the clock do it's unmemorable thing every hour.It always amazes me why people are so enthralled by clocks which do something on the hour, every hour. Maybe they like the thrall of reliability.But I wonder how little they have to do in order to be worth waiting for. This one beats the the one in Munich by a narrow margin.Apart from that then there's the church which looks great from the outside but is deathly dull inside.As beautiful as it is then the number of tourists is overwhelming so during tourist season then walking through the square is like being in a bumper car (dodgems?) arena. And worst of all is that this place is pickpocket central, and the pickpockets are very skilled here, so watch your bags, and don't wander around with your wallet in your back pocket because it will be stolen. The bars and restaurants on the square sell decent food and beer, but for roughly three times what you would spend if you took a tram for two stops in any direction.If it's cheap to you then that's fine, but realise that you're being ripped off.Out of tourist season then it's colder but generally less crowded and the vibe is better.I pass through there a lot on my way to somewhere else and the architecture is still amazing. So that's why I give it a 4/5 rating."

Once you have your order the restaurants tend to brush aside the fact they misled you.So definitely a lovely place to see, just be wary that the food and service may not match the pleasing surroundings."

To be recommended. Cheap and easy to use. We travelled all around the square and environs. A brilliant way to sight see with little or no walking. After a 5 minute lesson, we were left to our own devices, though you can join in guided Segway tours.In the evening, we came back for dinner, and there was still a lot of street entertaining happening.I cannot recommen spending many hours here, even if you just want to people watch and soak up the wonderful atmosphere."

Sounds, sights, lights, faces all come together to create a unique memorable experience. Starting from the teens sitting on the pavement, to the street artists and the forest of selfie sticks, that's truly a wonderful street-life experience. You might have a hard time navigating through the crowds, but in my experience they do contribute to the \"wow\" effect. My advice: plan at least two visits - one during the day, while the sights around the square are still open for visitors, and one in the evening."

Street artists are still playing music - trad jazz, drummers, living statues, singers, performers, well worth a few pennies given. The restaurants are all open, and unless you are a backpacker on a tight budget they are not expensive compared with other major cities like Venice where a meal / drink in the square will leave you feeling ripped off...put simply, the average holidaymaker can eat and drink anywhere in Prague without considering the cost. Steaks, Czech food, Pizzas, Roasted Hams, Fish Thai, you can get it all here and exceptional quality, even the speciality burger houses (not M, please!) are worth a visit. From the Square with the Tyn Church you can wander the backstreets to the Charles Bridge, of in the opposite direction the Palladium Shopping Centre, 5 stories of well affordable clothing, restaurants, and designer labels; or North through the Jewish Quarter (the shops have no prices on articles here, so if you need to ask the price...well just don't bother joining the Japanese tourists on their buying spree lol). North brings you to the River Vitara and the Jazz Boat / Day / Evening meal cruise, well worth it."

Like much of the tourist trail in Prague, the Old Town Square is rammed full of tourist (and those who prey on tourists) at all hours of the day and night. Worth seeing, but try and go early in the morning when it's not so busy. The crowd that gathers around the astronomical clock as it's due to strike the hour is particularly bad - we decided not to hand around to see this."

If you want to explain to anybody what bohemian means all you need to do is bring them to the Old Town Square of Prague (which ironically falls within the Bohemia region). This place is bustling from 8 am in the morning until late into the evening. You'll find several restaurants (almost all with alfresco and basement dining rooms), some stalls selling Prague Ham and traditional trdelnik and various acts put on by people from all over the world. The square has the astronomical clock on the city hall tower on one corner, the church of St. Nicolas on the other and the church of Tyn on the opposite end all guarding over the statue of Jan Husa. The square is also the starting point for quite a few walking tours and hence you may find yourself around here quite often."

There are numerous schlock merchants in the square and surrounding areas but you can easily avoid them. The astronomical clock is off to one side of the square, don't waste a lot of time there, it's good for a minute. If you want to book a hop on/off tour in the square you will have to walk a mile or so to get to your bus, there are better tours available in the square."

That is no reason to avoid it, though. First, it is a hub, and it leads to many other features of the city you will want to visit, but it is a destination itself. We were led to the square after visiting the Tyn church, whose spires are tucked back off the square itself. It's a wonderful place to people watch so even if the restaurants are a little over-priced and tourist-oriented, sit outside for a lunch or dinner and just watch everything and everyone that circulates through the area. Of course, you have do join the crowds that watch the hour strike at the Astronomical Clock (but make sure your purse or wallet is secure; it's a favorite place for pickpockets). There are plenty of other stands with street food if you are in need of a quick bite or a Pilsner, and you can even take an over-priced carriage ride around the area. The square here reminded me of similar locations in Bruge or Brussels or Amersterdam or Venice. They are just fun to hang out in and lead to better adventures."

Old Town Square was one of the first sites that greeted us as we strolled from our hotel to explore Prague with our disabled son, who was in a manual wheelchair. We were met with a row of small wooden chalets serving food and entertainers/musicians performing in the main area of the Square. The cobbled area was very busy especially when the beautiful Clock Tower was due to chime. However, a visit to Prague must include a trip to see the Clock and the Tower even has a lift!! At the top the views are well worth the effort ~ so much history and beautiful buildings. Around the Square there are many places to sit and relax with a coffee/meal and and enjoy the wonderful atmosphere."

There is also good food at the open pit During the day there may be a magician or bubble blower and at night wonderful musicians are in the square. This is the perfect spot to grab a beer and people watch to just take in the atmosphere. Horse drawn carriages are available and if you want to go to the top of the clock tower, do it between a quarter to the hour and the hour as most people will be crowded out front to watch the statues and this will give you more room to maneuver around the narrow area at the top of the tower. All ages will enjoy the square and there is a lot of great shopping within walking distance."

Just an amazing place.Prague has a distinct advantage over many European cities. It was occupied during World War 2 but not bombed. This allows all the beautiful buildings to show their best. Old Town Square is one excellent example of this.There are cafes and restaurants directly in Old Town Square. They are overpriced and mediocre. Do some homework and walk a block or two for a better experience.Lastly, as in all major cities around the world, be aware of pickpockets. Don't be an easy target."

Many of the buildings have been restored and are painted much brighter. At night it is also lit much better and the sights are different, but no less impressive than in the daylight. Another big difference is that now, some 17 years later, Prague has been \"discovered\" and is a major tourist destination. The crowds were HUGE - both in the daytime and at night.

For several years I had an office on the corner of Celetna and the main old town square. A very central, must see part of town. Interesting on its own right for the ad lib street performers the unique combination of architecture facing each different direction. And the hidden church which the two spires oversee it all. It makes for a good starting off point for your journey, regardless of which direction you go there are new and interesting things to see. Down Celetna street to the powder tower and you are at the theater and across the street from the Palladium modern shopping mall. One street over Doulha, is you best direction for variety and quality of restaurants. Pariska will take you straight into the Jewish quarter for fine shopping and possibly a visit to the old Jewish cemetary. Follow Staromestke , left from the clock for the scenic route to the Charles bridge and possibly continue on the the Prague Castle, after a stop along the way at one of the many cafes along the route. All other streets and alley ways will eventually get you back to vaklvske namestiOne word of caution, when the change of the hour is near the area in front of the clock will be completely congested. Just stay aware that now every one is there to see the clock and once in a while a few are there to watch how well you watch and photo the clock and not watch you pockets and belongings. If you want your own video of the clock in action, go around 8-9 am and have the place nearly to yourself. Be kind and reward the street entertainers if you are going to stand there and take in their show. Some are very good."

The amount of tourists that mass around the clock from about 15 minutes before the hour is immeasurable, everyone of them want the same photo so be prepared for a bit of hustle bustle! That said if you are prepared for that, then that can be part of your experience. The square is a place you can wander around and sit and listen to or watch the various entertainers on a daily basis Some good music being played whilst we were there."

Our apartment was close to Old Town Square and we walked through there more than once a day. The two spires were great guides when we were in other parts of Old Town...Adam and Eve, one guide called them. There are places to eat, people to watch, shops to browse, markets to peruse....just a great place to be. The clock that chimes every hour with active figures is interesting, but read about it first so you won't miss the names of the figures and what they represent."

It is surrounded with interesting architecture. The tower is well worth climbing. I found it interesting to walk up rather than use the lift. There are photographs of the last days of WWII when the Czech resistance rose against the Nazis on MAY 5th 1945 - just THREE DAYS before the end of the war. The resulting damage was horrendous. Much of the tower was destroyed. It has since been restored. The view of the roof tops of Prague from the top is very good. Nearby also is the astronomical clock. The performance of that on every hour was a little disappointing. I have seen better clocks. It also was seriously damaged by the Germans in the last week of the war and has been restored."

There are lots of shops and places to eat from expensive to more reasonable if you go down the side streets. There are many shops that sell the local crystal and you will find some lovely and varied pieces. Viewing the clock on the hour mark is a highlight. It is over quite quickly and so we viewed it a number of times to make sure that we had time to enjoy it. Its quite amusing when the rooster crows once and moves. Look carefully at the 4 figures especially the skeleton who signifies death as he beats a drum as well as the 12 apostles who only appear for a short time."

On the street you can seat down for a Thai massage, smoke shisha in Arabic lounge and eat pizza in most of the places.On the Carl's Bridge - one of the main attractions, you can find plenty of beggars in a relatively young age and its quite shocking. overall, the charming Prague is no longer there, instead the shopping, the eating and crowds can be found."

The space itself is very beautiful and historic, and there are fine architectural specimens to view.

Do NOT, under any circumstances, buy anything in this vicinity. When I say rip off, I don't just mean it's a bit overpriced. You expect that. One restaurant charges double prices to sit outside. No joke. (We didn't go in here...) One restaurant we did reluctantly eat in, after checking carefully for fine print about surcharges, slapped a cover charge 'tax' of 60czk on top of the bill (see my separate review of Hotel U Prince), and charges to use the toilet. Need to change some money? That's 20% commission. In real terms, we changed \u00a340 and lost nearly \u00a310 in charges. So turn up early before the rest of Christendom does, see the clock strike, take some chocolate box pictures, then leave and see the rest of Prague in peace and at a reasonable price."

The guy quoted us a great exchange rate which he then failed to give us. We lost about 28% in the deal, when we demanded a refund he became belligerent. Sad to say that this is such a common occurrence that when we complained nearby we were given a template to fill out about what happened. Three other couples were there with their complaints as well. Not a pleasant way to begin out Prague vacation. I don't understand why it's allowed to continue, but now we know better and hopefully others can be warned.

No, what is astounding is the genuine, completely original 14th century plus buildings all around you, each very different but a blended part of the whole square. No reconstructed WWII buildings here - its the real stuff 500 or 600 years old. Best seen on a sunny day or in the warm glow of a setting sun. The square looks different and nice again at night when most buildings are well lit.Just ignore the crass commercial exploitation of the square at street level.

We paid to go up the tower to take photographs. Go there late around 7:30 PM and watch the magic as sun sets (don't leave with the crowd) and get your camera ready. You would take photographs for which people will die! Sky turning from yellow to read! Amazing view, the best we have seen . You will not want to leave for everything looks so beautiful. Sadly, I am unable to use the panoramic feature of my camera but it could take amazing photographs. As you come down, stop and take more photgraphs from the place you take the elevator. It is worth paying.From the square, a the top of the hour see the magic on the clock tower as figures come out. Better have your video features in the camera ready (we never did and crowd came in front). i recommend staying away from the crowd and using the zoom to capture the scene. There are many gift shops and restaurants which are open well into the late evening. The food is average and over priced. You can hear musicians playing and jugglers performing (please pay them for the show)."

Its a great square with a huge monument to Jan Huss a freedom fighter for Protestants overshadowed by a cathedral representing the very power he was opposing. Curious juxstaposition. Here you get a sense of the history of Bohemia, Moldavia and Czech Silesia now called the Czech Republic. It evlokes its history."

It was while watching one of these groups that we were swept along to the corner of the Square by hundreds of tourists with their camera's in the air, it was 3 minutes to 12 and everyone wanted to see the Astronomical Clock strike and thanks to them my wife and I saw it as well.( if we wanted to or not ) Lovely clean Square with beautiful old buildings and a large police presence to make everyone feel safe."

Those that don't appreciate the clock clearly don't realise it's not a digital piece of plastic. It's the oldest working astronomical clock in the world from the medieval ages. The full description inside the old Town Hall tower is definitely worth a read. And the view from the top of said tower is great.The presence of a police van constantly overlooking the area in front of the clock is a reminder that pick pockets are about, but are clearly being watched themselves."

Keep your bag in front of you, leave important documents in hotel safe, split your money and put them in several different places. Do not take pictures for anyone, avoid taking money out in public, and it is best to stick together. Most of the time you cannot even tell if you are pickpocketed. It is a beautiful city, but the amount of people trying to steal from you is insane. big giveaways to pickpockets:- they will dress like tourists; cameras, iphones, backpacks-they spend an unusual amount of time trying to take a picture (especially with selfie sticks) and most of the time, they are just keeping the camera open to see what is behind them.-they might dress a bit more extravagantly: and usually they are paired or in groups. -they will also stand in one spot and watch, their eyes dart back and forth scanning you for where you may put your money and your important documents. other than that, definitely wait for the hour for the clocktower to show the 13 apostles and the skeleton shaking his head!"

The Square has just about everything going for it that you can think of. First of all it is a huge town square that is a major meeting place in the City. There are always tons of people there with many street performers providing various types of entertainment. But even with all those people it never felt crowded and we were there during the high season. There is of course the main attraction there: The Astronomical Clock, which everybody needs to not only see ring at the top of every daylight hour, but should hear about the story of its creation and design. There are alos a nice variety of shops in the area, from everything ranging from little souvenirs, to Swarovski Crystal, to luxury high end fashion down the nearby streets. Plus there are also a variety of restaurants with patio seating around the edges of the Square. One word of caution, if you eat at one of them don't get 'worked' by one of the waiters for a bigger than customary tip just because you they realize you to be American or British.And when you've done everything you want to do at Old Town Square, it is a hub to head towards the Charles Bridge, of the Prague Castle, or the Powder Tower and Opera House or nearby Republic Square, or Wenceslaus Square.There's a lot going on at Wenceslaus Square, but for my money I'd choose the Old Town Square as my desired destination to stay by."

I would definitely recommend going In the summer months because you can walk for miles around the sights of Prague which is much more pleasant in the better weather and you have the option of sitting outdoors relaxing eating and drinking which would you couldn't do In the cold winter weather. Prague is a great city to explore with lots of history and beautiful architecture. Definitely worth a visit and we will almost definitely go back!

In the touristic area the Czech people are there only to grab your money with nothing in return. The monuments are superb therefore I would prefer to spend a few hours on Google Street View than spending money to be highly disappointed.

There are of course the typical restaurants surrounding the square - but these are really overpriced places selling bad food, whose business plan consists of selling a comfortable chair to sit on and a beer or two.

Whatever you do, don't try to stand still here! The old clock has already been replaced with a replica, and it might be for the best if they did the same with the rest of the square -- just put up cardboard mock-ups in the train station, let people photograph themselves there, sell souvenirs next door, and you'd eliminate 98% of the people in the square.

Was looking forward to sampling.Advertised as 89Kc/100g (about \u00a32.50), but they cut you a big slice of around 500g and refuse to give anything smaller saying this is a \"portion\". Nothing to say this on the stall however.For one person 500g is a ridiculous sized portion. And \u00a312+ for a lump of ham from a street vendor is a rip off which some tourists are willing to pay - I suspect some are shocked at the size and price but too embarrassed to say anything . . and walk away . . . like I did.My \"portion\" was actually 2 pieces. I said I only wanted one. They refused. So, after an enjoyable (for me as I believed I was right) and loud argument I walked away . . . No sale.Tourists are being ripped off here. The young girl who was supposedly in charge was being totally unreasonable. Her side-kick cooking the ham and cutting the portion was verging on aggressive when challenged, the guy cooking the sausages looked so embarrassed.A German couple came to me afterwards saying they agreed with me and decided not to buy either.Everyone's choice how and where they spend their money - just please be aware of this con trick they employ to make you buy more than you want.Note - there are 2 stalls in Old Town Square (about 15 yards apart) owned by same operators. Neither would give a more reasonable portion."

Prague is a very walkable city so I\u2019d recommend booking a hotel that is just minutes away. We stayed at the Green Garland B&B which was a 2 minute walk to the square. I\u2019d recommend to go early in the morning before 8am to explore the city and the square as we did practically have the square all to ourselves. It was fun to see some brides take their wedding pictures this early in the morning. You have several sites in the square including the famous astronomical clock, Old Town Hall, St. Nicholas Church, Jan Hus monument and more. You don\u2019t want to miss the clock striking 12pm where the Apostles come out. Popular sites including the Wenceslas Square, Charles Bridge, and Jewish Quarter are only minutes away from the square. The square is filled with street vendors, performers and lots of tourists! There is a market off the square as you walk toward Wenceslas Square, which was suggested to us by our tour guide to be the best place to purchase souvenirs! I\u2019d recommend eat the traditional trdelnik, go to the top of the clock tower to view the city, and also eat at the U Prince Hotel, which is across the street from the clock. This is a very nice restaurant with a terrace that offers a 360 degree view of the city! The price was very reasonable as we ate pasta and salmon for only $35. If you don\u2019t want to eat there you can order just drinks or just go to the top and snap a picture! The terrace doesn\u2019t open until 11am."

You find there numerous restaurants and cafes, this is also a popular meeting point for different sightseeing and pub crawling tours. The only BUT - the amount of people. Sometimes you just elbow other people because you have to find your way through the crowd."

While a new friend suggested going off the square to eat, to save money, I found the experience delightful. My soup and husband's beer hit the spot, and watching the people go by was a large part of the interest. Also, while seated (a great pleasure, after a lot of walking), we were able to look at each building on the square, enjoy its beauty, plan for a time to watch the clock chime in a few minutes, and discuss all that we had done that morning. The young man who invited us into the street cafe had an excellent manner and seem to enjoy guiding people to his place. After this respite, we were ready to walk on to the metro."

Get a cold drink from a mini mart and find a spot on the benches by the Jan Hus statue and just watch the Segways, buskers, tourists, and a few scammers go by.

In fact I wasn't there to hear anything. Travelling is about soaking up atmosphere, the whispers of times gone by, the presence of lovers who held hands once in front of this beautiful clock and those who will in the future. This square takes one back to former times, and you cannot help but imagine the people through the centuries who have stood here and watched time go by with a skeleton to symbolise just how fleeting and transient life is.

Room was excruciatingly HOT. I read on HERE, there was good air-con...IT WAS A `FAN`, with a one metre cord on it ! So hard to place anywhere in room, but where it was ! Asked for a DOUBLE....Got 2 Very uncomfortable `SINGLE BEDS`` pushed together !!! Also, Pillows were flat, no filling, sheets/blankets/duvets/sleeping bags? (Still unsure WHAT they were?) Ridiculous ! And they were covered by, what I can only call `what looked like `CURTAINS`? I also read...ON HERE, There was ``black-out curtains` ! There was one nett curtain with an even more see-through (BLACK-OUT) curtains? A joke? Went asleep exhausted went down to find breakfast room and met RUDE reception guy who booked me, so rudely in and asked `have you been on all night`? He the `Ranted on about YES, I hate it and only get less than \u00a320-a-day/night ! And moaned on....I have to say breakfast was OK, not Fantastic, as I also read ON HERE !!!! LOTS OF BREAD, HARD BOILED EGGS, LONG THIN SAUSAGES, TEA, COFFEE, MEATS, FRUIT ...But the toaster? You can put your toast in, go and get your tea/coffee and STILL WAIT 5 Mintues for it to be TOASTED !!! Also, after a few day`s I noticed why I had to put my cereal and warm milk into a hot bowl? I seen the lady fill the bowls for cereals with HOT bowls, NOT taking cool one`s off, placing HOT one`s on rack `THEN` placing cooler one`s on top !!! Anyway went into town, less than 5minutes to Old town sq ! Very good Location (at least!) But is it worth it? NO !!! I came back later and into the bar, where they were busy, food ok, Very cheap, but as I say it was...ok ! Barstaff hardly spoke any english. They were working extremely hard. Later on in the week...They were replaced by other staff who didn`t speak english !!"

The architecture is stunning, from the astronomical clock to the statue of John Hus, to the Tyn church, it is mesmerizing. The atmosphere too is unique, you have a feeling of the history of the city, almost like you are no longer in the year 2015. Really a memorable experience. One issue we did have was orientation . When we went looking for the street leading from here to the Hard Rock caf\u00e9 , we could not figure out the street signs so well. But this does not take away from the square. Just expect some slight disorientation when you leave this magical place!"

The large black monument in center square is of Jan Hus, a man who started the Hussite Religion, and was burnt alive for his trouble. Also commemorated are the 27 Martyrs who were beheaded on this very spot. Not a very cheerful monument!The Astronomical Clock is one of the three still running in the world, but looking at it I'm not sure that anyone can understand it, certainly I couldn't.The 2 Towered old Church of Our Lady before Tyn was completed at the start of 15th century; but for the first 200 years was used by the Hussite Religion - and we know what happened to them. The other church is called Saint Nicholas.Watch out for those uneven cobble stones, and, from experience I suggest you buy your food from the outside stalls, I found it delicious and it saved me several euros.On the weekend there was plenty of outside local entertainment, and therefore I could imagine the Xmas Market would be frantic. Well the online photos agree.Brian, from Perth. W. Australia."

It's clear that Prague's Old Town Square is a beautiful and interesting spot but, with everything going on in the middle when we were there, it was impossible to get a really good view. There was a large Jazz Music stage and associated bits and pieces erected in the middle, together with what I suspect is a permanent array of food stalls in the Summer, which added to the vibe and atmosphere of the place, but drastically interfered with the overall impression of the Square"

The surrounding alley ways filled with little shops are great to walk through. Take your time, walk around, have a cup of coffee and enjoy the scenery and all the amazing things happening at the same time. You could literally sit here for hours people watching.The one recommendation I would make however is don't get caught up eating food here. Even though everything in Prague is relatively cheap (if you're coming from the USA or a Eurozone), there are much cheaper restaurants slightly off the beaten path. It's easy to get lost in Prague but also easy to find your way (you'll always pop out at a big site; Jewish Quarter, Old Town Square, Wenceslas Square, Charles Bridge, etc). Get lost, find a small little restaurant, sit down and enjoy the great, authentic Czech food."

The church (which apparently was used as the design for Disney's famous castle) overlooking the square is phenomenal - particularly when it's lit up at night. Make sure you return to the square after dark! It's still busy then, hough not as crowded during the say. The square, architecture (which reminds me slightly of Bruges), the sculpture and the church combine to make one of the best sights I've seen in Europe."

The 3 bedroom apartment was perfect! For 2 nights in Prague, we paid less than we did for 1 night in Salzburg. The check-in location is a bit dodgy, but they gave us a map, directions and keys. The apartment we stayed in was about 1.5 blocks away from secure underground parking, necessary if you are driving. It is also 1.5 blocks away from the Hard Rock, and another block to the Astronomical clock area. The apartment had free Wi-Fi, 3 bedrooms, one was part living room, and one room had a double and single bed. The building was a bit complicated, but didn't take long to figure out the outside door and internal door are controlled by a chip in the keychain that opens it. Also, the apartments are numbered, but the keychain is lettered to indicate which door. Other than this we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the apartment and location. If you need a place to stay in Prague with family, this is the location for you. We will definitely use this service again next time we are in Prague."

The architecture is absolutely beautiful and is not to be missed. HOWEVER, the walk into the square from Republic Square is lined with souvenir shop after souvenir shop, which truly ruins the ambiance of the cobblestone streets and historic buildings. Once in the square, there are a bunch of restaurants/cafes to have a bite to eat, but also a TON of tourists. This can be expected during the summer months, but for me this makes it almost unbearable. There are some small stalls around the back of the square - closer to the Astronomical Clock (which is beautiful by the way!) and I bought most of my souvenirs here since they offered a couple of different things and comprable (or cheaper) prices. There's also some food stalls sellings traditional Czech dishes. Definitely a place to check out, but be mindful of your belongings and be prepared for mobs of tourists."

Me and my friends bought student price tickets to go to the clock tower. The service was bad and it did not worth for 70 krones for students, since all you can see the the overview of old tower square, not how the clock works !!!!Disappointing ! However, we went up there during sunset, so it is a gd place to take photos. Please bear in mind that there are lots go tourist up in the clock tower, you have to be tolerate that people may push you. So, for me, I would not recommend you to buy a ticket to go up clock tower. If u want to see Prague's over view, i would suggest Novom\u011bstsk\u00e1 radnice !"

Many tours leave from Old Town Square, so it's hard to imagine that anyone will visit Prague without passing through. For those planning their trip, we'd advise not to get too excited about the much-discussed astronomical clock -- and don't spend much time waiting for its top-of-the-hour \"show.\" It must be one of the most over-hyped such things in all of Europe!"

And the famous clock tower of the Town Hall draws a crowd every hour on the hour as an elaborate mechanical procession of the 12 apostles rotates by the onlookers below. The place is always busy and noisy and filled with expensive tourist restaurants and cafes. We happened to find a great pizza place, called Al Minuto, however, in the left-hand corner of the square as you face the clock tower.

It will inevitably be full of people at all times of day or night, mainly tourists. One of the best sausages I've ever had was from one of those vendor stands lined up one next to the other on the astronomical clock side of the square. If you want to sit down to peacefully enjoy your sausage and beer, there is a small park with benches right behind the vendors. The only real annoyance of this square is the many people on segways that can sometimes be going extremely fast through the crowds. Not very safe for them or the pedestrians."

It has everything and more you'd expect from an Imperial (Holy Roman Empire) city square, with all the temporal (old guild halls) and spiritual (mighty church - Our Lady Before Tyn) monuments that would imply. The Astronomical Clock, which narrowly escaped being bombed in 1945, dates from the 14th century and is a marvel. Everywhere you look is something interesting and beautiful. The square is huge, and hosts many nice cafes which are perfect places from which to view the square and the other people, as well as to cool off in the hot weather. It's just a world-class medieval square, and you have to go see it; that's all I have to say about THAT."

The church is situated on the east side of the square. It is easy to spot as its spires rise above the buildings which surround the square, but its entry is harder to find - it is at the end of a passage which leads off the square.The interior is superb - well worth a visit.My only problem with the Old Town Square was that it was constantly awash with people flowing in different directions with large tour groups on foot moving en masse.Most of the restaurants and bars lining the square were packed.The people movement problem was exacerbated by the many segway hirers on the square, touting their machines to tourists.The segways flitted constantly in and around the tourists passing through.I liked the Old Town Square, I did not like the congestion."

This was our second visit here, and it was just as impressive as the first.Dinner at the rooftop restaurant (beside the U-Prince hotel) overlooking the square is a must do, but book well in advance. We missed it this visit, because they were booked through the weekend.While restaurants on the square itself are pricey, we can confirm Rick Steve's suggestion that restaurants one street off the square have equally good food at almost half the price...but of course you don't get the ambience.Live entertainment and juggler/panhandler type acts abound...along with throngs of tourists. Flash mobs appear at the famous clock tower at each hour, as the amazing clock does it's hourly thing. You can't go to Prague and NOT visit this square at least once."

You can see the whole city from here, since you are in the center of Prague. The view is unobstructed as there are NO windows on the balcony. Some signs explain what you can see from each side of the tower. Its great to see the crowds gather for the \"top of the hour\" show of the apostles on the astronomical clock. For a few dollars, you can get a tour of the insides of the tower/building and see the actual statues that show up on the little windows on the top of the hour. Its well worth it. If you just want to watch from the bottom of the tower, make sure to arrive at least 10 minutes before the top of the hour to get a good spot. There are many restaurants around from where you can enjoy your food/drinks and watch the whole \"15 seconds event\". In front of the tower, to the right, many street performers gather to \"busk\" and get coins for interpreting piano, singing, dancing, and everything else you can imagine. You can enjoy the \"Our Lady Before Tyn\" church and if you go behind it, you must visit the BRIC a BRAC antique shop where you can find very interesting mementos to bring back home. Behind the clock tower, you can get traditional czech pork and also traditional cinnamon pastry \"TRDELNIK\". Also, you can fetch a romantic horse ride. This is the place to visit when in Prague, close to the Starometska Tram Exit."

There are all kinds of acts going on in the square from Juggling to Opera singers. There are open air restaurants all around the square, but it is less costly to take one of the streets leading away from the square to find a restaurant. About 3 blocks down a street opposite the clock is a huge farmer's market which is a must if you're hungry for fresh fruit. I highly recommend the cherries. They were the sweetest and best I ever had, although a little pricy. I did not try them until I got back to the hotel, but if I had, I would have bought 5 times the amount. High end shops abound around the square."

Interesting historical landmark with many other attractions nearby (although the torture museum wasn't on my to do list), many arts & craft sellers with a variety of items (average/comparable prices). If in the area DO visit the Lennon Wall, must have irked the Russians being over the road from them, although there's always new graffiti appearing some original elements are still there. Don't bother with the river cruises, you can walk the area and see the same sights."

Once you have made your way through the maze of touristy shop lined avenues you will find yourself in the center of this old city . It is place where you can sit and people watch ( favorite past time ) , check out the astronomical clock , have a cup of coffee or meal or be entertained by one of many street performers. Within walking distance of the Old Town Square you will find old jalopy waiting to whisk you away on a quick tour of Prague . If you don't have a lot of time and want to see as much of the city as you can , then do one of these tours. It is relatively inexpensive as the driver charges per vehicle and not person . The Old Town Square is a must see on one's list of places to go in Prague . I was impressed with the cleanliness of the city . The locals we interacted with were proud of their city . It offered something for everybody !"

There are food vendors that are making hot food on the square and these were the best part, in our opinion. Try the fried potato chips on a stick or the crepes (palacinka) or the hot meats from the fire pits. We could not figure out how to get into the big black church but the yellow St. James church behind it is very nice; see my separate Review of that church."

If you are in Prague don't miss it. Also, on weekends there may be special events for free in the square. We saw a folkloric dance festival there. I do, however, want to warn about the stands selling Prague ham. Attracted by the hams roasting on a spit, and the sign offering ham at 89 Kronor per 100 grams, I asked for a 100 gram sandwich. I was told that actually the only size they would sell ham was 1000 grams, at a charge of 890 Kronor, or around 40 dollars. Since 1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds, this is a ridiculous portion, and that's just the meat. Apparently if you want anything else you have to pay separately. There were two stands, but they both said the same thing, and it appears that both are under the same ownership. (However, one couple saw the size of the portion that was being offered -- which did look like about 2 pounds of meat-- and refused to pay, saying that there was no way they could eat that much. The guy behind the counter offered them a half portion at half the price, but I didn't stay around to see if they took that deal.) I would also note that Prague ham in a reasonable portion (about 150 grams) can be had as an appetizer at the Caf\u00e9 Lippert, also on the square, for about the same price per 100 grams-- and the Caf\u00e9 Lippert is a very nice place, with very good food, and an outdoor patio with a view of the square.)"

Go visit the Church of our Lady before Tyn, and don't bother figuring out how to read the Astronomical Clock! It's really complex! We waited 10mins to watch the clock go DING!

Very buzzy square with crowds gathering for the hourly spectacle of the astronomical clock doing its stuff. Restaurants a bit mixed for vegetarians (which I am), but always found something good to eat, and a couple offered to make me anything I wanted! One restaurant (Olive) directly opposite the clock not so helpful. The manager didn't like the fact that a single person was occupying a table for four. Not my fault, they didn't have smaller tables, and given that I had a full meal, I wasn't impressed with him keep walking past tutting at the fact that I was there. I felt rushed and pushed out. However, this was the only time I had this experience. The world and its wife pass through the square, so if you're into people watching and experiencing the buzz, Not to mention the amazing buildings, then go for it. And it leads you down to the streets and onto the Charles Bridge."

It's most important theme is Jan Hus and his followers, the Hussites, who were the Czech Christian reformers. They are immortalized by the Jan Hus Memorial at one end of the square. There Jan Hus statue is gazing at Tyn Church, the original Hussite Church, the most famous church of Prague and of Czech Republic. Finally there is an area in front of the Old Town Tower where 27 Hussite martyrs were executed in 1621, marked by white crosses on the ground. This signified the loss of Czech independence for nearly 300 years under the Catholic Hapsburg rule. When Czechs regained independence they brought down Mary's statue that was in the middle of the square and placed it in a recess on the right side of the Tyn church which is often overlooked. I thoroughly enjoyed these findings, and I hope you do, too. "

Elsewhere in the square is the old town hall with an impressive astronomical clock (free) and a tower you can go up by lift (admission fee) for views over the rooftops in all directions. Around the square are attractive facades - mostly hotels and shops - and in the square there is always a crowd of tourists, and often entertainment such as musciains, mimes, food stalls etc. Definitely a \"must\" for any trip to Prague."

The crowd of tourists around the astronomical clock is always thick, hence the area is best avoided. Photographic options are best in the evenings. The restaurants in the square are always crowded. We loved walking the maze of alleys along the Old town square and discovering restaurants, souvenir shops and just soaking in the spirit of Prague. Prague is an incredibly beautiful city and the lesser known roads and alleys, cobblestone streets are more beautiful than the more well known cousins."

The down side for me are the crowds - money exchangers (never ever use them), enforced street entertainment, prices that are too high etc. Like the Charles Bridge, the square is never quiet and usually has swarming crowds. Historical note - take a moment to look at the white crosses on the pavement outside the Old Town Hall and consider what happened there after the Battle of Bila Hora (White Hill)."

There is plenty of action happening in the square, with living statues, fire eaters, singers, and tourists from all over the world. We loved the views at night, especially as there were fewer people and we could really enjoy watching the clock \"show\" on the hour. We walked through the shops around the square and generally enjoyed soaking up the vibe. We walked through even at 2 am as our hotel was close and felt totally safe. Of course you have to be aware of your surroundings, but the only time we felt at all uncomfortable was from a group of drunk tourists harassing me and making suggestive comments; otherwise, we were perfectly comfortable and safe.Do avoid the food vendors in the square, or at least read their signs CAREFULLY. We wanted to try the ham and the potato/cabbage mixture and ordered according to the prices, which were like 49 and 89 kroner. When our bill was 850, we were told it was because the price is for 100g (a portion, and we were given several of both items); when we requested to cut the portion size, we were told it could not be done. We could have walked away or argued but we just accepted it and paid the 850, considering our lesson learned. I wish we had been warned though, as $40 US was excessive for what we ordered. Still, we enjoyed the square and found the coffee and wine/beer vendors to be honest and friendly. By the way, the ham was very, very good, even though overpriced."

Street entertainers including spraying of huge bubbles and musical performance with variety of instruments was lovely. As in any crowded place, just be careful with your belongings.

That said, do what Rick Steves suggests and look up at the architecture and the crowds won't take away the glory of the experience."

You are surrounded by various forms of architecture and the famous Astronomical clock where is it rumored that it's creator was blinded once it was finished so that it could not be duplicated. I recommend hitting the square at different times of the day. Catch it in the morning when it is quiet...in the afternoon when it is abuzz with activity, and in the evening when things are lit up. If you are weary from walking all over, grab a beer and an outside table at the Oliva Verde restaurant just across from the Clock. From there, if seated far enough over, you can enjoy the clock from a shaded, seated location while enjoying some food and/or beverages.Oh, and I love Rick Steve's suggestion of first watching the clock, and at the next hour go to the base of the clock and watch the people. The \"show\" doesn't last long, but it is an amazing feat for the 1400's."

What a GREAT surprise! Our guide, Filip Huta, was extremely knowledgeable, and witty to boot. Midway through the tour we stopped to eat at Zephy'rs, a restaurant that featured local Czech food and beer. You also got a chance to coordinate and book other tours they offered as well.My expectations were truly exceeded and will most definitely use them to book other tours on return trips to Prague and other cities where Sandeman's operates. I put \"free\" in quotation marks because if you feel that your your was worth it, you are (lightly) encouraged to tip based on your experience. You will want to tip...and tip generously, as the tour was that thorough! The devil is in the details and we received so many details on historical tidbits, it was amazing. Again, look for Filip Huta for your guide!"

It was beautiful and was amazing to think that there are buildings in this square alone that are significantly older than the very existence of the United States of America. I would recommend this as a must-see stop while in Prague. One more side point, at this time the Czech Republic is struggling with some economic challenges and we found the pricing of nearly everything we bought or experienced to be very reasonably priced."

The square itself is surrounded by beautiful Baroque-style buildings and leads to a series of side streets that contain a variety of shops and eateries. The historic Our Lady Under the Tyn cathedral dominates the square and makes for a picturesque setting as the sun goes down. The famous astronomical clock and Jan Hus memorial are worth checking out as well. But the real attraction, aside from singers, performers, and mimes, is the food. There are several great cafes where you can get a really good meal, but in my humble opinion, the street food is some of the best in Europe. Nothing beats a grilled sausage, a side of potatoes and ham, and a liter of fine Bohemian pilsner! Prague is a fun city, and the Old Town Square is a great place to start!"

We went there in mid-December, so there was a Christmas market and this undoubtedly contributed to the crowding.

And the street stall that sells spit roast ham will rip you off (their prices are listed per 100g, and they give you large pieces - we were charged 1000kcr for a meal for two which is preposterous, but we saved some and put it in the hotel mini fridge so we had enough for another meal). I read on here (now!) that others have been ripped off by the same place too, so please, dear reader, avoid the ham place."

The lighting and night time scene is unique. The Square is free so that is a plus, buskers and restaurants make for a pleasant scene. It also the center where your walking tour across the Charles Bridge or in another direction to the Jewish Quarter can begin. There are open air markets just a block or so off the Square for fresh produce but other items. I found a most interesting original oil painting by an artist who has had shows here in California at a reasonable price. Prague is really a gem. We are so glad that we were able to visit."

The famous Astronomical Clock is sited here and chimes every hour! It's a must see sight!There are also street acts to see! The buildings are beautiful and it's nice to venture to some of the unusual restaurants and cafe, such as the cubism cafe, which was interesting, and contained various artworks; the views were also great, allowing you to people watch! You can always try and negotiate for whatever item you wish to puchase. I bought a garnet ring - Prague has its own garnet mines and these are controlled by the government. I got a discount of over 50% by shopping around. Whilst looking for a sparkly bobble hat, the shop assistant offered, without my asking, to reduce the cost of this item! I was therefore confident in asking other shops to see if they could compete with a competitive price!There is a reassuring police presence in the Square."

There were lots of people / tourists about and this gave the place a lovely \"buzz\". There were street vendors and artists doing their thing and this added to the feel of the place. Of course one of the main attractions in the square is the Astronomical Clock and it is worth waiting for the clock to strike on the hour to see the passage of the 12 apostles. The clock was installed in 1410 and it is the third oldest astronomical clock in the world but it is the oldest working astronomical clock in the world. I really like this square and this part of Prague. Although it was very cold on the day we walked around it was well worth it and well worth exploring the small streets of the square."

We were a five-minute walk from Old Town Square and went there several times either as a destination or on our way to another attraction. It was an amazing place, with sights such as the Astronomical Clock and Old Town Hall, and shops and restaurants in the historic buildings. It was fun to wander around the Square as well as up and down the small narrow streets surrounding it. In addition, the Christmas markets were open, and it was great looking at the merchandise and food for sale as well as watching couples and families visiting from different countries. We managed to go there at different times of day and night, and, while crowded, there was always a friendly, holiday atmosphere."

One day there will be a serious accident but I hope before that they will be banned so that walking tourists can enjoy the square in something closer to its original form and atmosphere! Also the tables outside the pubs and restaurants are increasing and almost taking up half the square. It should not become like a Disneyland but a joy to cross and wonder at the architecture and beauty of the variety of styles.There seems to be no limit to the touts, segways, stalls and guides or no rules!!"

The square is located directly in center of old town and the main attractions are statue of Jan Hus and mainly, the old town hall and astronomical clock. Situation with pickpockets is getting better each year, however keep eye on your pockets and belongings when watching the astronomical clock could be worthy. I would definitely recommend to get a walk in surrounding area located between Celetna street and line of streets Dlouha, Kozi, Hastalska - it's a network of narrow streets with amazing atmosphere of old Prague, my favorite even I had walked around for hundred times:) Don't be surprised with higher prices of goods and services offered in the area, it's a touristic center so the prices reflects this fact. Anyway, there are nice places where to get a coffee in Dlouha Street. I (I'm 28 ) prefer NOD cafe located above the Roxy club. The place has kind of atmosphere I've enjoyed i.e. in Berlin or Amsterdam.."

In summer time, there are many street artists performing here, which adds to the ambiance of the square. The architecture is just stunning with all its different colours. Sunset is amazing here, with the setting sun accentuating the colours of all the buildings. There are also many bars and restaurants here, you could easily spend a whole day strolling around in this beautiful place."

The Square is the heart of Old Town Prague, and its a must to find some time just to wander around or sit in it (even if its winter!), and to soak up the historical atmosphere. The Square is variously surrounded by medieval/Gothic, Baroque and Neo-Classical buildings, including buildings with frescoes, which is quite a rare and beautiful combination of architecture. The Astronomical Clock is also a must see. A walking tour - some are free - is probably the best way to gain a feeling and understanding of the Old Town Square. Just try to avoid buying food or drink on the Square, as the prices are very expensive (c. \u00a33 for a coffee, at the time of writing), but there are plenty of places nearby where a cheaper deal can be had."

But just have one drink and sit at a pavement bar people watching for a while.In the square you will find the astronomical clock, which always attracts tourists and tour guides on the hour as the clock strikes and.....well you will have to see won't you. Also dominating the square is Tyn church and the Town hall tower. At night in particular when the fairytale turrets on Tyn are lit up it is a memorable image.By the way, there are some great restaurants hidden down side alleys, and one in particular - Melijice I think from memory - has superb food and service at a good price. The 2kg roast pork knee and the plate of ribs are just 2 of the very filling and superb meals, washed down with a glass of Czech beer of course!"

Reach this square by purchasing a 24-hr transit pass (110 crowns/$5) at any metro station for unlimited rides on metro/trams/buses/furniculars, then take the green Metro Line A to Staromestska. This is where the famous Tyn Church (the inspiration for Disney's Sleeping Beauty Castle) and the Astronomical Clock (the oldest working clock in the world) are located. If you're here starting the first week in December, the Christmas markets are open for business, so enjoy their holiday treats like trdlo (spiral fried pastries covered in sugar), mead, and svarene vino (sweet mulled wine), perfect to keep you warm in the frigid Czech weather. Avoid buying souvenirs in Old Town since they are terribly overpriced; instead, hop to the west side of the Vltava River to Mala Strana for cheap goods and a wider selection of restaurants and shops."

The Old Town Square in Prague is beautiful and as many other reviews have mentioned, at night it is magical, especially the Tyn Church, which dominates the square with its magnificent twin towers - whether it's true or not, our guide told us that Walt Disney based his fairy castle on this church. There always seem to be lots going on in the square and in the evening we were entertained by a fantastic music group and fire dancers. The Astronomical Clock, built in to one side of the Old Town Hall Tower, dates from the 15th century, and on the hour crowds gather in front of the tower to watch the wonderful show as the clock chimes. It begins as the two windows above the clock open, and the twelve apostles march round, whilst the other figures, either side of the clock, begin to move. The figure of Death holds its hourglass and beckons to the Turk (symbol of Lust) which shakes its head in response. There is Vanity portrayed as a man with a mirror and Miserliness as a man with a moneybag, shaking a stick. When the apostles finish their journey, the golden cockerel at the top crows and quivers its wings, the bell rings and the clock chimes the hour. Below the Astronomical Clock are 12 medallions with the signs of the zodiac. Definitely worth a visit is a trip to the top of the Old Town Hall tower which is almost 70m high where you can enjoy an amazing view of the entire city. It doesn't cost much (seniors get a reduction) and there are lifts, so you don't have to climb if you don't want to."

We stayed right on the Old Town Square \u2013 it felt like something out of a Medieval movie, but with happy smiley people!Long morning walks turned into lazy lunches and late night shopping \u2013 so much to see and do! One of the highlights is definitely the astronomical clock right on the square, you can\u2019t miss it as there are about 100 tourists swarming around it at any given time!I loved the small gelaterias and galleries to be seen on every corner and the square played host to different musicians and entertainers every day and night.Whether you want to buy a beer and savour some of the local street food on the square or go for a thai massage or exotic cocktail \u2013 you will not be left wanting by this experience.Prague has moved to the top of my list of favourite European destinations, I cannot begin to imagine how different the vibe would be in winter but I plan on finding out one day!"

You can use the bus then metro/tram to reach you destination anywhere in Prague.I advice you to take tickets worth 32CZK (5AED) which you can use upto 90mins to reach your hostel/hotel. Taxis will cost you min 800 CZK from the airport.Things to do in Prague:Prefer staying in hostels for supercheap accom.Try their local foods like sausage, goulash soup, beef stew, cinnamon bread roll etc.Try their local beers Pilsner, dark beer and hot wine.Visit Old Town, Charles bridge and its tower for great view, Castle, Hanavsk\u00fd Pavilon (for the perfect view of Prague city), Jewish quarter, Wenceslas square & Lesser Town.If you have extra day in Prague, take a daytrip to Kutna Hora (UNESCO World heritage site).Do not miss Pubcrawl (300CZK), Beerwalk.Buy some good souvenirs. There are plenty of free walking tours based on tips.Things Not to Do in Prague.Do no take Taxi even if they say it will be charged as per meter.It is advisable to carry Euros than AED. Or always withdraw from ATM as needed.Do not exchange money even at the most attractive office without double checking. Always Bargain. You can get upto 1Euro = 24-26 CZK.Do not exchange money from strangers.Do not get fooled by food vendors when they sell local cuisine as per weight in grams. (Always mention the no. of grams you need before they make the bill).They have plenty of strip clubs. Becareful to always use money. No credit cards as they can duplicate.Any doubts can always contact me at arjunmenonv@gmail.com"

The enormous and wonderfully decorated Christmas tree was the centerpiece of this magical Old Town Square alive with food stalls and a marketplace filled with hand made goods! Try a trdelnik! It's a cinnamon pastry dough, rolled on cylinders and roasted over an open fire!! It's amazing! The smells from the food stalls, the energy, the lights with the large Tyn Church backdrop and you can't believe this is all real and not some fantasy movie set!! There is an initial sensory overload but it's easily something to just absorb and feel the magic of Christmas!"

A good tip is to stop off every now and again, sit down in a bar and have a beer somewhere, before setting off again.Don't miss the Astronomical clock when it strikes the hour, but beware the crowds for a good view. Also best to be particularly vigilant with bags, wallets, cameras etc. Although nothing happened to us, I have heard of other people being pick-pocketed, but as in any crowded place away from 'home' a little common sense is all that is required to avoid any problems."

Nevertheless, it is worth a visit. When we were there, there was a Czech bluegrass band (!) playing live in the street, singing in a mix of Czech and English and selling their CDs. People were listening and buying. You can also see the famous Astronomical Clock with its magical figures appearing every full hour and climb the tower to see the wonderful view - for a fee though. There are also some art galleries and a lot of cafes, pubs and restaurants in the vicinity. It can be VERY crowded though, so watch out for pickpockets and just walk a mile or two away to find more peace. During the Christmas time the decorations are fantastic and rich."

I visited the city on an extremely cold day, but it was still very beautiful with the Christmas markets and the festive atmosphere in Old Town Square. The markets were not the best I visited during my European tour, but it was still nice to see the stalls and visit with the locals. Interestingly, our tour director had cautioned us to leave our passports and any valuables in our hotel safe and not carry them with us during our time in Old Town, due to the high number of pickpockets in the square. I was prepared for this, as I'd had other friends who have lived in Prague warn me of the same thing, and found myself being especially watchful as I moved alone through the crowded square. I noticed that a man with a large satchel and inadequate outerwear was staying close behind me, and I moved deliberately to see if he was following me. I realized that he was, and I finally stopped in the middle of an open area on the plaza, turned deliberately, and made eye contact with him. He stopped short, looked back at me, then grinned and shrugged, as if to say \"can't blame me for trying.\" He turned and walked the other direction and I didn't see him again. I felt safe the entire time, but my advice would be to stay diligent and watchful in the crowded old square, but enjoy your time in the \"City of spires\"."

            "review": "Old Town Square and Prague. My first 3 hours.. Walking from our surprisingly comfortable hotel to the famous Old Town Square was a great introduction to Prague. A sculpture on a small bit of land near an ordinary parking area was an amazing piece of art, with it's bohemian representation of what I would suppose is an expression of the sill fairly recent joy of life in this great city. Struck by the many small shops and the diverse architecture, walking awkwardly on the cobblestone streets avoiding public transport buses filled with locals on their daily routine, the magic of this amazing city had already cast its spell only blocks into our visit to Prague. The unusually high percentage of attractive locals was a another surprise, as well as the unusually high percentage of people that spoke very good English. Like many older European cities, the entrance to the Square is through a typical sort of gate tower. Called the Powder Tower, it was built something like 600 years ago, covered with ornate statuettes and a bunch of generally old-looking stuff. A few step further and find yourself in tourist central, with a crystal shop every 100 feet, and every other manner of trinket shop. Restaurants and desert shops fill the spaces in between, with a few specialty shops adding color to the mix. A hawker in a Shark suit danced and pranced to entice people to try the Thai massage place which was very busy soothing the sore soles or the poor souls that had been walking all day. Prague is spread out, and is generally a walking city, but as you enter the Square, a myriad of choices are presented for exploring what many call the most beautiful city in Europe. Around the square your tour options include walking tours, Segway tours, Buses, Horse and Buggy rides, a sort of key-west-style train thingy, and a number of antique convertibles with willing drivers (many of the cars appear to be replicas of 20's era English touring cars). Immediately struck by the number of tourists from all over the world, walking around the square you can hear the unfamiliar accents from every corner of the globe while at once watching a juggler, a man blowing huge bubbles, a magician, several musicians, and a number of other exotic street performers. The glorious feeling of chugging a beer on a warm day while taking a large bite of a delicious sausage and taking it all in was an un- extraordinary experience none the less burned into my brain as an unforgettable experience. A quick trip to the Starbucks on the Square to fuel up before exploring turned into an experience in itself, with an amazing array of exotic and irresistible pastries and overly charming and very attractive young women serving with perfect English and wonderful service. One of the great attractions in the Square is the Astronomical Clock Tower, which is essentially a huge coo-coo clock built into a tower where you can climb stairs to the top and get an amazing view of the Square and the surrounding areas such as the Tyn Church on the opposite side of the Square, built around 700 years ago and Prague Castle far off in the other direction. After taking in the Square area, streets fan out in almost every direction offering countless shops of every kind, surprising artwork, and a huge dose of Czech charm. Ill write more one of these days about adventures on the streets and nightlife.Anyway, maybe I gush too much, but I loved Prague and its people, the food and culture. Everything was much better then I expected, and I did not expect almost everyone to speak fluent English which made everything easier. The city is not unusually expensive and there is plenty to do keep busy for a long time."

It's a large square which had a Christmas market on it when we were here - usual stuff, hot wine, sausages, tourist trinkets etc.The clock tower is the main draw, and we all stood patiently waiting for it to amaze us with it's wonders. When the time comes, two little doors open and some models go round inside the clock. If you have been to the clock in Munich you will not want to breathe all the second hand smoke required to witness this poor effort. It's surprising how offensive being smoked all over feels, after years of smoke free Europe, but it will happen a lot in Prague, even in restaurants.The Christmas tree made up for the poor clock performance, it was huge and very well lit. The whole place succeeded in producing the Christmassy atmosphere we were looking for."

The church with its astronomical hour is a beauty. It is worth noting that this is quite an expensive part of Prague. It is full of tourists. Take your time and enjoy!"

Note that food is priced per 100g and therefore when you are served a generous plate of roast pork it will be weighed and priced considerably more than you were expecting!!! Prices are steep in the square but drop considerably as you move outward. I was not impressed by the popular dish of a pizza base squirted with ketchup and sprinkled with parmesan. How basic can food get? However the cinnamon and nut coated pastry curls are a delight as is the mulled wine. At night these markets are beautiful with the fairy lights and Christmas trees."

The energy is palpable and one can find people of all sorts with their cameras of all sorts. Pit stop / destination / starting point for many conducted tours, IMO, unless you want all the details of who built what when and why, a lazy walk through the myriad streets are enriching on its own and the square is the cherry on the cake. Even the modernization has added its own charm. The myriad street artists (bless them, truly truly talented) the clock rhythm every hour, the sounds and the yawing centuries old buildings are overwhelming. The restaurants / cafes in the side streets are predictably less expensive than the ones in the core. A holiday well spent for me just walking by the old town streets.PS: Though not as notorious as maybe Paris, pick pockets and con men do mingle with the tourist crowd, so be cautious and enjoy the city without and loss."

We loved the Christmas markets although they became totally overcrowded on 5th December when the festival of Angels and Devils takes place, the day before St. Nicholas Day. The Christmas markets are smaller than those in other cities such as Vienna and Cologne but everything was locally made. We particularly liked the stalls selling freshly cooked unleavened dough with cinnamon and sugar. Well worth a visit during Advent and in the week after Christmas. We loved the atmosphere, the enormous illuminated Christmas tree and the views of the floodlit Church of Tyn. There is a small stage where school children and choir boys were performing in the early evenings."

After seeing many photographs of the famous bridge in Prague I decided it was a place I must visit as the phographic opportunities looked enormous. I was right. Within minutes of arriving at the hotel, which was 10 minutes quick walk from the Old Town Square, I had taken about 50 photographs. This was just on the way there. The architecture throughout the city centre is fabulous. In the square are many attractions,stalls, troupes of artistes and it is surrounded by these gothic type buildings with towers and turrets reaching to the sky. At weekends the square is heaving with tourists, especially in the evening, as there are many displays going on, each with its crowd of spectators. During the day, and during the week it is quieter and the best time for pictures.. Just past the square is the famous Astronomical Clock which periodically chimes and displays a series of religious figures in little windows around the clock. So, periodically, there is a huge crowd of tourists gathering at the base of the clock awaiting the display. A camera with a video facility is a must for this. With a short wait, it is possible to climb the tower stairs to the top for a bird's eye view of the square. Worth doing.. Around the square are many open air restaurants with estensive menus at reasonable price and all selling the famous Czech beers. The square is a few minutes from the famous bridge, but this is the subject of my next review. You must visit Prague, good hotels, many restaurants, lovely shops and friendly people."

When the sun shines on the top of the buildings of the Old Town Hall, the Churches and the centuries old houses surrounding. It is a good opportunity to get a good picture. Special tip and warning: Beware of the the exchange offices located in the area and especially the one in the corner close to the souvenir shop opposite the City Hall. Its exchange rate on display is very attractive. But that exchange rate only applies (maybe!) to when you change HUGE sums of money! Ordinarily, when you change a couple of hundred dollars or euros, the rate is MUCH lower. If you are in hurry and do not read the fine print, you will suffer big losses.The best way to avoid this sort of crooked deals is to use an official bank ATM only, NOT any forex office. They are tourist traps, nothing else."

Don't miss the gothic house \"U kamenn\u00e9ho zvonu\", the fantastic medieval astronomical clock and the house where Einstein used to meet Kafka and other Prague intellectuals in the salon of Mrs. Fanta. Climb the tower of the Town Hall with a fantastic view. Avoid the tourist trap restaurants and cheap junk souvenirs. You can get better food in other parts of Prague."

The band deserves an excellent rating.Except for that, I didn\u2019t feel any particular magic about the place. Perhaps my romantic circuits are not connected in the right way. Sure, it is old worldly and it looks like a scene from movie. It has the right prerequisites: A statue (of one Jan Hus), a view of a funky looking church (\u2018Our Lady before T\u00fdn\u2019) and funky paving (unfortunately not romantic cobble stones).

Many un-touristy spots to eat some authentic pork, sauerkraut and dumplings, or maybe some beef goulash--just need to search a bit off the main path. Also, be aware that much of the \"garnet\" jewelry is suspect--if the stones are big, they are probably not real garnet. Look for jewelry made with many small stones and interesting settings."

The Clock Tower together with the surrounding buildings, the food venues, shops around and the lots and lots of people gathering together were the targets for our photo-taking. We have also paid the fee to go up the Clock Tower and watch the people clustering below and the pictures were very special if not stunning. At night time, still many people clustered around for fun in the Square. We will definitely visit this Square again in the future as we considered this venue a \"super star\" tourist spot for tourists."

In mid-October it still teems with tourists, with young people on Segways (annoying), great street musicians, the ubiquitous painted \"living statues\" (plus a man levitating when we were there) and evidently, a slew of pickpockets.As long as you have your money and credit cards safely secured, you'll have a great experience in the square. My son still has fond memories of his first trip to Prague, during the World Cup a few years ago, when there were great big screens installed in the square and every young person from every country who was in the city at the time was packed into the square rooting for their favorite team.We watched the astronomical clock do its thing from the roof of u Prince. My advice is that you don't need to drop whatever you're doing just to run to the square to see the astronomical clock chime the hour. Evidently that is prime pickpocket time as everyone is engaged taking photos and not paying close attention."

However, every other tourist to Prague comes here so expect big crowds. Those crowds will also double in size every hour on the hour to see the astronomical clock do its stuff. There are also loads of buskers and other people pushing tours and places to visit. Also prices in cafes and shops here are astronomical as well.So definitely come here, take in the sight, soak up the atmosphere, push away the vendors, take your photos, and then move on."

As waterways were the only \"highways\" in ancient days, many lovely old towns lined the major rivers of Europe. Our 15 day cruise from Budapest to Amsterdam took us through the Danube, the Main, a man-made canal and finally the Rhine. It was a relaxed and comfortable way to see Europe, especially if you have already seen all the big, flashy touristy cities - the usual suspects, Paris, Munich, Frankfurt etc. On the river cruise, you visit towns you will never see when you undertake a land trip as many are small and quite out of the way. That does not make them any less attractive or interesting.If you have the time and have already seen the \"usual suspects\", do splash out on a river cruise. It is a little more expensive but well worth the money."

But the Astronomical clock is worth five minutes of your time to see it do its thing on the hour. And the shop Erpet (almost opposite the clock) is worthwhile for crystal. If you love ice cream, go down the side street next to Erpet about four blocks and there are two good ones: Boom and Angelato (turn right just after Boom to find Angelato on a side street). The square is much prettier early in the day or around dusk when the crowds are gone."

Don't miss the opportunity to climb the Old Town Hall Tower for a stunning view over the square.Wenceslas Square and Charles Bridge have some amazing architecture too, in all Prague is a wonderful place, its has plenty of atmosphere for either a romantic break or a trip with friends."

The square is large, with multiple churches, a ton of cafes and a number of street vendors, lots of people people watching (and probably listening) - sit on a bench or in a cafe and spend a bit of time before you wander through the shops on the square and adjacent streets. Check it out at night, too! Restrooms are available in your restaurant, but there are public, well marked WC's, also."

You can watch the horses and carriages and drink coffee at one of the many restaurants around the edges of the square. The Alphonse Mucha museum has an entrance there and it is definitely worth a visit. We saw a Dali exhibition while we were there. The side streets are cobbled and full of small shops and cafes.

The square is lined by magnificent Baroque and Gothic churches, as well as imposing Renaissance palaces; and of course the Old Town Hall,and the astronomical clock; which draws large crowds to watch the procession of saints at every hour.There are plenty of cozy cafes where you can experience local fare, and pubs, each with its own menu of beers. You could explore this area for days and still not uncover all of its hidden wonders."

Old Town Square is indeed a unique place where you can see the concentrated mixture of buildings - architecture which takes you through the centuries. My advice for those who like architecture is : sit at the bottom of the centrally located statue of the famous reformist of early 15th century Jan Hus and just look around and enjoy the spirit of the place. Than go and dip into the narrow streets of the Old Town."

The centuries old astronomical clock attracts thousands of viewers when each hour strikes, the rooster crows, the bells ring, and the disciples emerge. Watch for pickpockets in this crowded venue. Numerous indoor/outdoor restaurants abound, but beware, their prices are pegged to the tourist, not to the locals, who think anyone paying $5 for a cup of coffee or beer is crazy. And they are right. The same can be had at half the price just a few blocks off the square. A statue of Jan Hus is a central feature in the square. A stair climb or elevator to the top of the city hall's clock tower is worthwhile for a grand view of the surroundings and a bird's eye view of the square. A must-see location when in Prague.Gaye and Peter, Victoria, B.C., Canada"

Although the clock of the Old Town Hall has been rated the 2nd most disapointing tourist attraction, I'd recommend you get to know about the clock's history and symbolism: it makes it very interesting indeed (but do not expect much from the \"clock show\", cause there isn't much indeed)."

I could not fathom any grammatical tips so that I could learn some Czech. but otherwise, it's was such a joy to roam around the squares and streets of Prague. Its history is so rich, and the castles, palaces, monuments and museums, are well kept and well guarded. But what I liked most was the night atmosphere. It felt safe and homely going round among the lit up shops and restaurants. We were in a hotel close to Wenceslas Square.  This square is awesome! It's so long and active!And the incline towards the museum is so imposing!! From the other end you can walk through a few narrow streets that reminded me of our Imdina, and you find yourself in OLD TOWN SQUARE.  OH...this is an amazing place.... it bubbles with activity. It felt like being in a romantic place where you feel your heart beating faster with excitement! The crowds are so happy, so many nationalities enjoying themselves simply by walking around, or drinking at a bar, or having dinner in one of the many restaurants all around. To see everybody smiling and having fun is a joy to behold. Something else I noticed is the reasonable prices of drinks and food. I was misinformed about the city, having been given the impression that it's very expensive. It's very reasonable, and the people are so helpful, although I have to say that It lacks knowledge of the English language.Very few people speak good English, but we got around easily in spite of that. The old clock attracts many tourists, as it has a particular tone on every hour.  I can say only this.... if you haven't been.... you must go....and be as romantic as you can!!! Enjoy Prague!"

The Chocolaterie VIVA Praha offers awesome & delicious Belgian-origin, but Czech-made chocolates. It even has a \"museum\" showing you how superb chocolates are actually made! Remember to take your Camera with you to the Old Town Square and to have an eye around for any rarely-hitting pick-pocketers. Rarely hitting because the place is most of the time supervised by discrete Police. So, nothing to be really scared of, just have an eye out for your personal belongings... Especially, your pockets and wallets!"

Loved our first visit to Prague and the Old Town was our favourite, however we felt that the equivalent to around \u00a322 was very expensive for a portion of potatoes, cabbage and bacon and ham with two slices of bread! My husband could not see a price before ordering and did not realise that the price 'depended' on the weight of the meat you were served. These were bought from the wooden cabins in the square. Myself and my daughter had a dish that was similar to a pizza except that the dough was fried, one would have been plenty between us, bought from another cabin and was fairly priced. Saw quite a few tramps/beggars here but they were not offensive or intrusive. Tip: remember to have 10Ck (about 30p I think) for all the public toilets, some hotels also charge even if you eat at their restaurant."

Yes, you'll have trouble squeezing through the crowds gathered beneath the astronomical clock as it approaches the hour. Yes, the restaurants and bars scattered around the square are expensive. But I never get tired of walking through it, of gazing up at Tyn church (either stark against the blue sky, or with its towers lit mysteriously beneath the stars), of listening to the musicians who give it its soundtrack, of seeing the waiters spraying the tourists with a water hose in the summer. The last time I was there, there was the Bohemia JazzFest, and I stood listening to the music with a beer from the nearby stands that sell food and drink. Make sure to visit it during both the day and the evening to see its different faces."

An interesting tidbit: we were walking through and there was a very large crowd of very \"dedicated\" Swedish football (soccer) fans outside an Irish Pub preparing for the evening game against Sparta, the Prague team. They were chanting and singing outside of the pub and later in the day, they were PEACEFULLY escorted by riot police to the stadium. Definitely an interesting site to see and hear.

You stand around with a large crowd as the hands move ever close to the top of the hour. When the hour hand reaches 12, the skeleton on one side rings his bell and raises his lantern, then the hours are struck and the doors open and the apostles rotate through a little door. The striking stops, the door closes and that's it, that's all, it's over. The crowd actually started laughing at the underwhelming performance we had just witnessed. So definitely go and see the clock because it is beautiful and worth a photo, but if you feel you don't want to wait in a crowd for several minutes to see the \"performance\", don't feel that you are missing something spectacular, because it is really short and not all that great."

It is so sociable and you see such a range of people, from stags and hens, to lads and girly city breaks, to families, to couples, to a bride and groom having their photographs taken with a horse and carriage. It's a great place to people watch and try the endless brands of beer. Prices are the cheapest we came across while on our trip, you can eat and drink like royalty compared to Germany or France. the quality is really good and even though there are endless restaurants in the square, i found they all did something different. at every quarter to the hour you noticed the crowds of people waiting for the famous clock to chime on the hour. I was a little underwhelmed by the display but it was defiantly a spectacle to see and you should hang about to see it while your there. It's more interesting if you learn the story behind it. "

We joined a walking tour early in the morning and we were quite surprised to see that the square was already full of people. There were just too many groups milling around, especially near the clock. Without the crowds, the square was lovely, surrounded by old buildings and churches, food stalls in one corner, coffee shops and retail stores and the tourism office. We were warned to take care of our belongings as pickpockets also abound in the area, and they just mingle with the crowds. The astronomical clock was beautiful, truly a gem ahead of its time. Just watching it was an experience in itself, with all the moving figures, etc. We wanted to return in the wee hours of the morning to view the square without the people but didn't have the time to do so. Perhaps on another visit,"

Needless to say the Irish and English bars aren't anything other than Czech.Do note that the local fast food stalls selling smoked Prague ham, etc show their prices per 100 grams so are not as cheap as they may appear but still taste good.Directly opposite the astronomical clock is a hotel where you can go upstairs and get and excellent view of what it does on the hour (and a sit down) for the price of a beer or a coffee and their cakes are excellent.

Be careful as the portions are large and the cost is by weight so don't be afraid to ask for smaller portions or share.

Good sausages and beer are a bit higher priced than elsewhere. Watch out for vendors advertising 100g portions of Prague Ham or potatoes, but a reasonable serving cost much more."

We spent a lot of time there, especially at night, when all the buildings are lit up and it becomes truly magical.A must visit in Prague, though eating in the restaurants can burn quite big a hole in your pocket. To avoid that, we used to take the tram to the suburbs and had amazing food at cheap rates."

Wouldn't usually eat at stalls like this but were in a rush to get to our tour starting so had no choice. The prices displayed are for weight, but you don't get to choose how heavy the food you are served is. So the price displayed isn't really close to the price you end up paying and unless you speak czech or refuse to pay, you'll be caught out. Massively over priced and would definitely avoid."

Between restaurants with outdoor seating areas clogging the walkways, souvenir shops cheap and dear, costumed characters (including someone in a Lego suit), hawkers, and a gazillion people, I could have been in Times Square for all I knew. Yes, the Astronomical Clock is a wonder, but surrounded by thousands of people when it sounds off. The street musicians are quite good, but amplified singing of popular songs is not why you go to Prague.There is much history there, but you get no sense of that except in the early morning hours when the place is abandoned. Which pretty much tells you the best time to see it."

The wonders of the Old Town Square are architectural, historic and the stuff of legends; chiefly among them the 1410 astronomical clock, the statue of Jan Hus (John Huss) and the gothic/baroque churches and palaces. Unfortunately, despite rainy, cold weather the Square was mobbed. Hungry homeless types scavenge the leftovers from open air eateries and literally watch you eat, hoping for a few scraps. There was a drunk sleeping on the pavement in the drizzling rain. We have not seen one policeman. The food stands serve ham heated/grilled over wood-burning stoves, sausages and a mix of potatoes, cabbage and bacon. Beer is an obvious complement. It is all overpriced, too cold and too salty to merit a recommendation. The beer is OK. The two pink Port-a-potties labeled \"Jenny\" in the center of the Square reinforce the impression the Czechs care more about tourist numbers than their cultural heritage. Once I got past this fairly shocking first impression, I loved the elements of the gorgeous Square. The astronomical clock is a wonder, especially when one pays attention to the 4 figures next to the dial and below the procession of the apostles."

From there we backtracked to a local Mc Cafe to get our bearings, and I was able to download a walking tour of Prague on my phone, which consisted of 20+ sites to see. We began our self-guided walking tour, and slowly but surely we were able to understand why we always heard people fell in love with Prague! We stopped in Old Town Square for lunch, and that is where I first truly felt the wonder and excitement I was so eager to feel!

            "review": "A wonderful place. This square alone makes a visit to Prague worthwhile. The architecture is striking, as is the old town area in general. Dominated by church spires and towers the view in any direction invites a lengthy viewing. The astronomical clock is a marvel considering its age. It chimes with a display of the apostles on the hour from 9am to 9pm. The white crosses around the corner from the clock have an interesting history as well. The statue of Huss indicates the religious divides of the past and lessons for those willing to learn. The food stalls and other entertainments both add and detract to the atmosphere. On one visit, Czech Republic was in the finals of the Ice Hockey World Cup and the crowd of avid fans sang, waved flags and roared its way through the game adding even greater character to the square. Prices for everything around the square are inflated, food and drink especially so. Ask the price before you order. On a sunny day, the square is absolutely packed with thousands of tourists. There is a need to be aware of pickpockets, segway novices and horse drawn vehicles. The best advice is to get into the square early in the morning before most arrive and enjoy the atmosphere, archtitecture and history. It's a short walk down to the Charles Bridge and old Jewish Quarter from here. If you don't wander the square on a visit to Prague, you've done yourself a disservice. A must for anyone interested in history, architecture and cultural significance and for someone just wanting to be impressed."

Far too many people for it to feel comfortable walking around. If you want to eat any of the food from the stalls please be aware the prices quoted are for 100 grams not per portion. (Ham, potato etc). Also ice cream are prices per scoop but you get half a scoop not a full one....where as if you walk off down one of the streets off the square you can get twice the amount for much less money...http://www.boom-gelato.cz/en/gallery/Also be careful when changing money as in a lot of the exchange places what is advertised is not always what you get. Example we changed 60 euros.... one quoted 900czk another 1200 czk and should have been 1532czk which we got at another."

We had come for ten years in a row both before and after the Velvet Revolution but this was the first time since the Caech Republic had joined the EU. What was once a magical place, Prague remains so, but with overwhelming and crushing numbers of tourists (we among them) and the commercial honky tonk that comes in its wake. The activity in the square now is such that, except for the snake charmers, you could be standing in the middle of the main square of Marakesh. Yet, the beauty and wonder of the city, its authenticity and essential character remains, so long as one looks up and marvel at what you see while trying ignore what is going on around you."

And as most people have noted this old historic square of Prague is seriously crowded at all times especially with the dreaded tour groups wandering around complete with hyper guides franticly waving umbrellas above their heads, and the surrounding restaurants reflect this too in their prices. But having said this try eating in the extortionate over the top St Marks square Venice, and you'll see the difference. This old square in Prague does have a lot to offer for everyone including the famous Astronomical clock tower, St Nicholas Cathedral, eating stalls etc. I also felt some of the restaurants weren't too expensive either considering where they are but, just off the square the prices start dropping dramatically, just shop around and you'll find a perch to sit and do some serious people watching with a beer or two, and along with some street performers makes a nice place to visit on a daily basis. It's also a very historic place with some stunning architectural buildings to behold from a long gone era of Prague.If you do feel like shopping here don't, unless you have a hefty bank balance to match. Just walk along to the outdoor market and you'll find the same gifts at a fraction of the price, you can also haggle a little too they don't mind. Remember this place never sleeps night or day and there's something for everyone here, if you wander off the square don't panic, as nearly all the cobbled roads lead to the river or back to the square at some point, just enjoy the experience.Do also be aware of pickpockets around here as all it takes is one of those scum bags to spoil your holiday, and a magical time with one act of complacency....!"

I wouldn't really bother with the restaurants, from viewing several menus they looked pretty ordinary but very expensive (expected in the tourist centre).

To get there, take the metro to Staromestska.At the Old Town Square, it is common to find many temporary market stalls. I was attracted to the stalls selling hand-crafted products. The shops in Prague that were offering Bohemia Crystal and Slavonic Art had caught my eyes when I was at the Old Town Square. Although I did not buy any, I had a wonderful visual feast of beautiful hand-crafted art when I visited the Old Town Square admiring what the many shops and market stalls had to offer.It was possibly difficult to miss the Powder Tower which is one of the original 13 city gates in Old Town, Prague. This majestic tower is of Gothic design, as best as I could recall.While visiting the Old Town Square, make a visit to the Astronomical Clock Tower. The view from the viewing gallery of the Astronomical Clock Tower was amazing. Thankfully, there are modern lift facilities to take visitors up to the viewing gallery. Of course, for the adventurous, walk up via the stairs. There is an admission fee to get up to the viewing gallery of the Clock Tower. Students (including international students) can enjoy concession, so please bring along your student passes.Along the streets of Prauge's Old Town Square, it was common to find horses on the streets to ride on. Enjoy the old time charm of riding on horse carriages.In short, you must visit the Old Town Square. No visit to Prague will be complete without visiting the Old Town Square."

We walked across Karluv Most (Charles Bridge) and then meandered our way through the cobbled and narrowed streets leading into the square. It was busy upon our arrival at 9pm but we later realized this was the case on the hour every hour for the setting in motion of the four figures of the Astronomical Clock (which is an astounding sight in its own right). During our stay we enjoyed a few Pilsner Urquells in the square and we always found it a pleasant place to be. Keep a pocket map handy as it easy to find yourself lost, particularly at night time. And if I had one tip for the tourist authorities of Prague it would be to ban the Segway's from the Staromestske namesti, they simply do not fit with the rich cultural and historic vibe of the area."

Having dinner outdoors at one of the restaurants on the square makes for a wonderful evening of good food a people watching.

The Old Town Square was magical, including the famous Astronomical Clock, but going during Christmas time makes it even more so with the amazing Christmas markets. After traveling Europe and sampling the markets in various places, the Old Town Square market is far and above my favourite, having both unique goods and lovely atmosphere. Even during the rest of the year, I'd highly recommend this place as a good spot to people-watch and soak up the atmosphere. I would highly recommend going to the top of the clock tower for some lovely views, but in my experience they're better during the day as little is lit up at night, so the views and photos weren't the best. The restaurants around the square are a bit touristy and expensive (as you might imagine), but one or two streets away will get you more authentic fare."

In the middle of the day the square is packed with tourists from all over the world.

So I went to an exchange place, and a tout told me that he would give me 2,100 of local currency for USD, which was better than the 1,800 at the exchange place. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I gave this lowlife my money, and he gave me 2,100 units of currency. I happily went back to the artist to buy the painting, and when I gave them the money, the artist told me it was BELARUSSIAN currency -- not accepted in Prague.

The remaining section of the old city hall (attached to the side of the astronomical clock tower, the rest was destroyed in the bombing during WWII) is fascinating and testament to the dedication of the people of Prague, especially given what they have had to deal with over their history. I prefer the square later at night, when the buildings are lit up and there are a few less people around. A must-see while in Prague and one of the nicest squares I've seen anywhere in Europe."

He did attempt to say 'want to change some money?' to my girlfriend, but I think he knew it was a lost cause, and we all had a bit of a laugh.In this case I was quite glad to read that hanging around looking like a tourist might lead sketchy fella's to see you as an easy target, and it worked out very well that I was able to be surreal enough to not be seen as an easy target ;)"

What makes Squares so important is that each one is a fine insight into that cities character, history and soul. Old Town Square is one of the more unique squares in that it is reminiscent of a fairy tale much like those found in Brussels or Munich. Furthermore the musicians\u2019 playing classical in the streets is very unique and shows the Czech\u2019s love of classical music. I am told that this is a result of the lack of music options during the Communist days. Regardless, you cannot avoid Old Town Square and there is no reason to want to so make sure to take it all in."

Our accommodation was rated 4\u2606 but by uk standards probably 2-3 but more than adequate for 3 night break."

From the hourly show on the Astronomical Clock with the crowds of tourists and the sound of the trumpeter to the ringing of the church bells, this has to be top of your list of things to see in Prague. When J and I visited, there was a jazz band playing live music in the square. Amazing by day and night, when photogaphy is something of a challenge! You should have an ascent to the top of the tower on your ''to do'' list. It costs CZK 100 and there are two lifts to the top where you can get a decent picture of the church with its twin towers. Views across the rooftops in all directions. The walkway around the top is narrow and it takes time to squeeze through but it is worthwhile."

The Astronomical Clock is wonderful.A trip up to the top gives you a spectacular view 360 deg over the city.Luckily next door was a photographic exhibition about the time during the revolution which was very moving and educational about the history and bravery of the Czech people.The atmosphere was great- (be careful of pickpockets though)"

However, it seems to be ever more crowded (even during the winter months now) and you need to find a space on the edges to actually enjoy the architecture without being trampled by the tour guides or run over by the Segways! The Astronomical Clock draws large crowds on the hour when you can see the windows open and the figures appear while Death rings his bell to remind you that we are all mortal! The Christmas Market is a shadow of its former self when in previous years, the stalls used to fill the square and overflow into the surrounding squares and streets - my photo from the Town Hall shows how small the market now is. Beware the pickpockets and watch the prices in the restaurants and cafes - they can be exorbitant in the square!"

There is an angle here for all interests... political, religious, science or merchant history; or just for the avid shopper or relaxed coffee- or beer enthusiast. Visiting in winter has the plus side of less visitors = more space, while visiting at more clement times offers the opportunity to sit outdoors to enjoy... if you find a table and chair!

You could really spend the whole day here just watching people come and go, especially if you are able to grab a seat in one of the benches at the square. People from every part of the world are here, along with locals doing everything from having raucous beer parties sitting in circles on the ground to newly-weds getting photographed. The entertainment is constant: there are several street bands playing, clowns and street artistes doing their stuff, horse carriages clip-clopping around, and performers blowing giant soap bubbles. All around the square are some of Prague's biggest attractions: the world's oldest working astronomical clock, in front of which perhaps a couple of thousand tourists assemble on the hour, every hour, to watch the famous apostles and the skeleton figures to emerge; the gothic Church of Tyn with its distinctive pointy domes, one of Prague's most recognisable landmarks; the famous statue of Jan Hus, at whose base hundreds of tourists are permanently seated, watching the hustle and bustle of the square; the Czech national art museum, which was showing an Alfons Mucha selection when we visited; etc. There are several restaurants, and if they are full up (which they constantly are), you could go to the food stalls serving delicious hot sandwiches and kebabs. Just off the square is Pariszka, Prague's high street, where all the international fashion labels have stores. The din of the square is suddenly missing here, and the tree-lined avenue is pleasant to walk up and down on. In all, the square deserves at least a half day of your time in Prague, and it could easily be more if the weather is pleasant."

When we rounded the corner and saw this beautiful square with its old medieval buildings, the fairytale like tower, the church towers and the tower where the astronomical clock is at, it took our breaths away. This is a truly beautiful square--you feel like you have walked into a fairytale. It is popping with life and people and there is always something going on here. There is are stalls that sell food and their Prague ham, which is on a spit, is truly delicious. This square has jewelry stores, souvenir shops, restaurants, etc. You can find everything here. At night, the square is alive with people walking around. This is a very lively square to be in. This is also a very central location to the other attractions in Prague."

The Christmas market in Old Town Square is magical. The sights, sounds, and smells were amazing. Be sure to sample Trdeln\u00edk (pastry rolled in sugar) and hot Medovina (honey liquor). Large roasted hams on spits, sausages on rolls. The Christmas tree and the cathedrals at night. I was there on Saturday, which was pretty crowded, and also on Sunday, which was very pleasant. People were friendly and responded well to my attempts to speak a few words of Czech. Shopping was plentiful. Some items were obviously mass produced, but also possible to find hand-made items. There are also many unique shops around the market square that are not to be missed. Hand-made marionettes, chess sets, matryoshka dolls. The spirit of Christmas is truly alive in Prague."

With the giant Christmas tree in the center of the square against the backdrop of the clocktower, cathedrals, and what looked like \"castles\" to us, the various booths selling traditional foods and trinkets (probably mostly for tourists), and the festive atmosphere of the crowd, it was simply joyful to be there. Over the 5 days we were in Prague, we would come to the Old Town Square pretty much every morning before we started the rest of the day, just to take in the view again, and each time it was just as fantastic as before. We also spend New Years Eve here, and it was amazing to watch fireworks from all around the square (though it does get a bit rowdy)."

            "review": "Prague's most exciting place. The Old Town Square dating from the 13th Century \u2013aka Staromestske Namesti in Czech- is the jewel in Prague\u2019s crowning architectural glory, having been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1992. Should you have only one day available during your Prague visit, this is the place to start and finish your tour, taking in spectacular evening city views from the top seeing platform of the astronomical clock tower.I visited the Old Town earlier this year and found myself spoilt for choice by the sheer variety of its sights and delights. It\u2019s a treasure trove for style and design aficionados and a Nirvana for medieval history and architecture buffs. As Prague is a different city with each season, the Old Town Square is home to an enchanting Christmas Market in December and an even more joyous Easter Market in April, drawing in traveler crowds from all over the world. No point in complaining that it\u2019s very crowded and touristy or that it has its fair share of pickpockets and scam artists \u2013 that\u2019s an epiphenomenon of modern tourism affecting all famous city squares in the world - be it the Grand Place in Brussels, the Spanish Steps in Rome, the Place du Tertre in Montmartre, the Puerta del Sol in Madrid or the Piccadilly Circus in London, to mention only a few very popular and \u201ctouristy\u201d squares in Europe. For history buffs, the whole Old Town as well as the Lesser Quarter and the Prague Castle is an immersive experience in medieval history; for the architecture traveler the Old Town Square is a fantastic display of Gothic, Baroque and Rococo, as well as Art Nouveau style.For culture cravers and art lovers there\u2019s a branch of the Czech National Gallery right on Old Town Square, in the former Kinsky Palace, plus an impressive range of art galleries located in the old town\u2019s historic houses. And there\u2019s the small Mucha museum just a 10 min walk from the square on Panska street, dedicated to the Czech artist Alfons Mucha, one of Art Nouveau\u2019s most prominent figures. It displays his paintings and Art Nouveau sketches and has an interesting shop selling artful Prague souvenirs and postcards, books and posters. Some of the artist\u2019s paintings can be admired at the splendid Municipal Hall on Republic square.Of note, the Franz Kafka museum (on Cihelna 2b) can be reached after a 15 min walk from the Old Town Square, crossing Vltava river over the Manesuv bridge. For style seekers there\u2019s an endless choice of boutiques brimming with artful accessories and kooky merchandise for your house or apartment. A special mention goes to the myriad of shops selling some of the most beautiful and eccentric Bohemia crystal creations -vases, glasses, lamps-, many of them unique, coming in the most vivid colours and unusual shapes (photos attached). Vendors are initially asking stratospheric prices but bargaining is possible, and in general they are willing to offer a notable discount, especially if you are paying cash. Once you\u2019ve agreed a price, the only problem is the sheer weight of these crystal beauties \u2026 Lovers of unusual and quirky things may be surprised, intrigued or disappointed at Prague's Sex Machine \u201cMuseum\u201d (18 Melantrichova St, a few steps off Old Town Square) showcasing various mechanical erotic appliances through history and old erotic films. However it\u2019s more of a quirky exhibition than a museum and not really worth a visit at the admission price of CZK 250 pP (\u00a3 7.5 / $ 12 / \u20ac 9 ). Vintage car enthusiasts have the chance to do an \u201cOld Prague tour\u201d in a beautifully restored vintage roadster or convertible from the 1920s ! Photographs attached, details enclosed below. There are some average to good restaurants on the square but I noticed there\u2019s better value for money in the collateral streets and further afield. There are two excellent restaurants at the famous Municipal House on Republic Square, only a 10 min walk from Old Town Square. OLD TOWN SIGHTS not to be missed:(For all sights, the nearest public transport stations are Mustek or Staromestska)OLD TOWN (\u2018s former town) HALL \u2013 Listed historic building founded in the early 14th Century (1338)A very heterogenous mix of medieval buildings from various periods housing Prague\u2019s main Tourist Information Office + art exhibition spaces + the old Council Chamber and meeting room + a Gothic chapel + the underground halls (aka Romanesque-Gothic cellars) + its best part: the clock tower with the astronomical clock. Guided tours cost 100 CZK (adult) / 50 CZK (child) / 70 CZK (students/seniors).Opening hours: Monday 11 am- 6pm /\u2028Tuesday - Sunday 9am \u2013 6pmCLOCK TOWER (separate tickets needed)The massive Gothic Clock Tower at the Old Town Hall \u2013 roughly 60 metres tall, completed in the late 14th Century, offers stunning panoramic views of the Old Town and far beyond; best experienced at dusk and in the evening !Admission: 100 CZK (adult) / 50 CZK (child)Opening hours: Monday from 11am-10pm, Tuesday to Sunday 9am - 10pm (on certain occasions closing times may vary, please check at the main Tourist Information Office in the adjacent Old Town Hall)ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK \u2013 over 600 years old (installed in the early 15th century, in 1410), on the south wall of the Old Town Hall, one of the Prague's most popular tourist attractions and the world\u2019s oldest astronomical clock in working condition. There\u2019s a clock show every hour, on the hour, so no wonder it\u2019s the most crowded corner of the square. Beat the crowds rushing in at the hour by arriving 10 min before, to see the procession of wooden figurines representing Christ and his 12 apostles. The clock shows the movement of the sun and the moon and how they relate to the zodiac signs. Hours of operation of the clock show (apostles parade): 9am \u2013 11pmFor unobstructed photographs of the tower, most spectacular views are at night (and less people too). CHURCH OF ST NICHOLAS \u2013 Baroque architecture with Rococo exterior decoration; according to many authors it has the most elaborate and beautiful church interior in Prague. Not to be confused with its \u2013much bigger- namesake in the Lesser Quarter (Mala Strana). The location is great for people watching and photos of the square.TYN CHURCHThe Church of our Lady before Tyn or simply Tyn Church is Prague\u2019s second most important church after St Vitus\u2019 Cathedral. Distinctive Gothic exterior with a heavy baroque interior featuring a colossal pipe organ. Majestic views of the floodlit church can be had from the top platform of the opposite Clock Tower at night.KINSKY PALACE (aka Goltz-Kinsky Palace) \u2013 a monumental Baroque construction with a beautiful Rococo facade; now a branch of the Czech National Gallery hosting various temporary exhibitions and a collection of Czech landscape painting. Franz Kafka attended secondary (high) school there at the end of the 19th century. MUCHA MUSEUM \u2013 for lovers of Art Nouveau. It\u2019s on Panska street, just a 10 min walk from the square. JAN HUS MONUMENT in the square's centre, unveiled in 1915 to commemorate 500 years from the death of Jan Hus, a major figure of Czech medieval history (priest, philosopher and first Church reformer, burned at the stake in Konstanz / Constance in 1415).CHRISTMAS MARKET Spend an enchanted evening mingling with the locals at the Old Town Square Christmas Market in December Weekdays 9 am - 7 pm, Weekends 9 am \u2013 8 pm VINTAGE CAR TOURS through Old Prague in a 1928-1935 convertible (Old Town + Venceslas Square + Lesser Quarter +/- Prague Castle). The tours, led by knowledgeable drivers, start in the Old Town, taking in the Jewish quarter of Josefov and cross into Prague's Mala Strana district (or the \"Lesser Quarter\") on the other side of the Vltava river. Prices are quoted per car (for 1-4 persons) and depend on the length of the tour \u2013 e.g. a 40 minute tour costs CZK 1200 per car ($ 60 / \u00a3 36 / \u20ac 43.5) + an additional CZK 100 for the Prague castle, going up to CZK 3,000 ($ 149 / \u00a3 91 / \u20ac 109) for a 2-hour tour. Some of these historical cars dating from the 1920s-1930s can be usually seen parked on Parizka street, in front of Cartier (opposite St Nicholas church). You can also choose & book a tour online at http://www.historytrip.czTo summarize, Prague\u2019s Old Town Square is one of Europe\u2019s most atmospheric and exciting places. Great sightseeing, shopping and people watching in a well preserved medieval World Heritage site, offering something different with each season. Marius C. Berger, MDLondon, UK"

Featuring various architectural styles including the gothic T\u00fdn Church and baroque St. Nicholas Church, the square is an oasis for travelers wearied by Prague's narrow streets. Among many churches, tourists may find the Astronomical Clock on this square, while the tower at the Old Town Hall offers a panoramic view of Old Town shop.The square's center is home to a statue of religious reformer Jan Hus, who for his beliefs was burned at the stake in Constance. The statue known as the Jan Hus Memorial was erected on July 6, 1915 to mark the 500th anniversary of his death. The square is also home to a memorial to martyrs (including Jan Jesenius and Maxmili\u00e1n Ho\u0161\u0165\u00e1lek) beheaded on that spot after the Battle of White Mountain. Twenty-seven crosses mark the pavement in their honour. While the installation date of these crosses is uncertain, a nearby plaque which lists the names of all 27 victims dates from 1911.during my visit the Christmas Markets were on so very atmospheric. Great decorations which came into their own at night along with the ad-hoc entertainment from jaz bands and fire juggling.

What's very sad is they have carried on abusing the tourists who come back less and less because of the horrendous prices. you go about 10 miles out and it's a different ball game. Beware of pickpockets as they are rife in this area. Christmas markets were great, they have delicious hog roasts, mead and mulled wine on every corner. Romance and chaos aplenty. On New Years eve the city centre errupts into disarray as fireworks are launched off buildings, launched into small alleyways where people casually walking through get the shock of their lives. It was quite a spectacle where the festivities move from the square to Wencesslass Square and carries on till dawn, hooker alley was as busy as ever. All in all you really need to see this city. Be wise with what you spend and where you keep your money, a little organisation and a few Czech phrases will help a lot."

The T\u00fdn Church could easily be Cinderella's Castle. It's truly a magical place. It's the main square in Prague, so be prepared for tons of people at all times of the day. They were all just as stunned as we were with the beauty of the scenery around them. Everyone was taking pictures and enjoying the atmosphere. There are many wonderful cafes & shops as well. If you're here for the day, just start at the castle and work your way over to this square. You'll cross over Charles Bridge into Old Town and see many attractions along the way. This route will lead you into Old Town Square. It's a beautiful walk!"

This is the best place to exchange your money whilst in prague.There is no commission and you get exactly the rate that is displayed for your currency on that day.The shop is open from 9.00am - 8.00pm everyday. Do not be influenced by better rates displayed elsewhere,as these are false and very misleading.As I was running late one day and was half an hour from the shop,I tried several exchanges displaying roughly the same rate and everyone out of a total of 5 was a scam.One would of even ripped me off for \u00a310 less than what I should of got! so I ended up walking into town to the shop I could trust.If in a similar position and you cant get to this shop it is always best to ask first how much you will get,NEVER hand your money over and expect to get what you think.Because once it's gone it's not coming back!The exchange is situated just 2 minutes from the old town square atKaprova 14/13110 00 Praha 1 - Josefov, \u010cesk\u00e1 republikaif your no good with directions just google it before you go or on your phone while your there."

There are also little kiosks set up with food and crafts. In the middle, is a kiosk where they spin large hams on open flames and you can buy it by the hunk. If you like ham, get some. This is the best ham I have ever tasted and will forever compare the rest to it. I always felt safe, but with the large crowds around you just beware of pickpockets. During the day, you can enjoy the architecture and the beauty of the surroundings."

Just sit outside one of the restaurants and 'people watch' whilst enjoying a coffee or something stronger. Mime acts, jazz bands, buskers and (while we were there) an excellent pianist who had brought his own electric piano on a trolley, abound. Old fashioned stalls selling traditional food can be found here and on top of all this you have the phenomenon of the Astrological Clock which draws hundreds to watch it on the hour. We spent ages here, always something to see and entertain you. Don;t miss!!"

It is really fun to hang out and watch all the people/things going on. The astronomical clock in action was a bit of a disappointment as it doesn't really do much.

Try the city tour before exploring, because it will change your perspective of the buildings, as you learn about them. I advice not to eat on the square though, on the food tent beside the St Nicholas church, it's a tourist trap as the price seems low, but actually they charge you for weight of the food and they don't even ask you how much do you want. So be careful with that."

Just off of the square is St. Michael's Monestary that holds evening concerts. We attended one and were disappointed. The actual event was not what we expected based on the promotional information and we found it a bit \"cheesy\". Also, they sell you \"preferred seating\" in the first few rows at a higher cost (includes a glass of champagne) but the room is so small there are only about 8 rows of chairs in the entire room. There are a number of shops with souvenirs - while many prices were similar between shops we did find a couple that were much lower so it pays to shop around. The hop on hop off bus tour stand is located at the square and provides a nice overview of the city - particularly helpful if you are staying only a few days; it helps identify where you would like to spend some time. There is also a large shopping mall not far from the square. The food court is worth checking out; really great food and not the typical fast food courts found in North American malls."

You do NOT have to pay full price! When we were approached the original price was $22 Euro's per ticket. By the time we went to walk away it was $16, and I'm pretty sure we could have named a lower price.Almost every shop is overpriced- if they are not really busy, you can ask for a discount if you are buying more than one thing.

Lots of caf\u00e9s and food stalls line the sides of the square. I would caution visitors when they purchase from the sausage and smoked ham stalls (they look like they are under the same company). The pricing of the smoked ham is Czech Kronor 89 / 100g, so one would think we would have a choice as to how much we want. Not so here. The man who smokes the ham cuts off a slab (often a very large slab), even when there are just 2 people eating it, and we don't have a choice but to accept it. He cut 600g of ham for 2 of us. Many people were seen throwing away the extra ham, which is wasteful. As for the sausage, it was tasty but contained a lot of cubes of fat in it."

I visited the old town square in December 2012, as we walked down towards the square the first thing we could see was the huge Christmas tree in the middle of the square it was magical. There was large crowds of people in the square itself and it is very touristy but it is deffinetly worth a visit especially at Christmas time. the square is surrounded by magnificent Buildings. There were a lot of food stalls selling very tasty Czech food like sausages, pastries, crepes, mulled wine, etc, I enjoyed sipping the mulled wine as I walked around looking at the stalls as it can be quite cold during the evening time.and the other stalls sold different things like Christmas decorations, hand made crafts, etc. There is also cafes and bars in the square and after a few hours of browsing around the stalls, we sat outside in one of the bars, the waiter gave us blankets as it was quite chilly, and there was a heater beside us to warm us up and it was lovely to have a drink and watch the great atmosphere of the square. There was a big open air stage where a choir was singing Christmas songs and the whole square was lit up with Christmas lights everywhere, it was beautiful. The world famous astronomical clock is also located in the square and every hour on the hour, the astronomical clock comes alive. I would deffinetly recommend visiting the old town square especially at Christmas time it is just magical....."

There are a few with roasting pig and a Czech version of potato salad. It looks and smells amazing and you'll most definitely want some. You'll want some until you find out how much it costs. A gentleman sliced off a generous piece of pork and together with a bowl of potato salad, the total came to.......... 580 CZK. That's 27-28 euros or $35. Yeah..... right. $35 for a $7-10 meal? To put that in perspective, every restaurant we visited cost less than that for two full, hearty meals, several beers and a few appetizers. Prague is the most touristy city I've ever been to and they take advantage of it. Be mindful of the prices for everything (don't even get me started with the taxi rip offs) and plan your meals wisely."

It will stay empty.Basically, a tourist ripoff. Go, see the clock, etc., but skip the restaurants. They are insanely overpriced."

Stand in the middle of Old Town Square and you can see architectural examples from the 1400's through Art Nouveau, one of the few places in Europe that can happen. Climb the Clock Tower, try to figure out the Astronomical Clock, see the lights on the Tyn Church at night, take in a concert in St. Vitus Cathedral, and just watch the performance artists (always with one hand on your wallet, as the pickpockets can be devious...). It's a great place to have a beer at night and watch the lights and people. I am not fond of the food, which is overpriced and of poorer quality than you can get elsewhere in this wonderful city. Use the Old Town Square as the center of the star--walk north on Pariska to Josephov (Jewish Quarter), east to the Powder Tower and Assembly Hall (one of the best Art Nouveau examples in the city), southeast to Charles University and the Estates Theatre, south to Wenceslas Square, and west to the Charles Bridge and ultimately to the castle across the Vlatava River. It's a must for all tourist visitors."

Get ready for plenty of tourists staring at the famous clock tower - and then leaving dissappointed a few minutes after the full hour. The ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK is pretty stunning, considering that it was installed before Columbus discovered America. At that time the only one in the world, they blinded the maker of it so he couldn't create a duplicate. There is plenty of history and back in the days it was a spectacle to see the little figures wave at the crowd. Keep that in mind or you'll be joining the group of people leaving with a big sigh. There are no lasers and spaceships involved...There should be lasers and spaceships involved with the \"ORIGINAL PRAGUE HAM\", though considering the bold prices... Right in front of the church at the square there are a couple of booths that sell some delicious looking pieces of ham (enough for one and a half person), serve it on a paper plate and make you eat it standing up in the rain (worst case scenaro, of course). And all that for only EUR 25! Fantastic! No, not really. You can stuff your face including apetizer, beers, main course and desert for two people in a restaurant off the beaten path and pay about EUR 20. FREE WALKING TOURS start at 11am and 2pm just to the left of the clock. Get your number from one of the guides with the yellow umbrellas and follow your guide around the city. We went on a fantastic 2.5 hour tour, learned a lot and saw some streets that weren't packed with people. I highly recommend that - I also highly recommend tipping the guide at the end of the tour as that's their only income."

All kinds of tours meets and starts here.Be aware of the street food vendors here, Old Prague Ham looks good, but they charge you 89Kr for 100g and only cuts 400g per order. We stopped by for a quick snack, but end up getting a meal portion. We gave what we cannot finish to the homeless guys, but felt we were taken adv of."

A little bit complicated to know the logic behind the clock but just funny to have a look."

Prague's old town square is crammed with amazing architecture and beautiful details, from the incredible astronomical clock with its ornate face and moving figures to the gothic T\u00fdn Church and impressive St. Nicholas Church. The square is always packed, especially on the hour, every hour when the clock performs its elaborate routine and can get quite overwhelming with the sheer mass of people descending. There's lots of bars and restaurants lining the square where you can take a well earned break and just watch people milling around. After dark the pub crawl touts are out in force, urging people to join one of the many bar crawls, but getting drunk and missing out on the beauty of Prague by night seems like a monumental waste of time to me!"

I've experienced some big squares (Tiananmen in Beijing, China; the Zocalo in Mexico City), but the Old Town Square has it all: ancient monuments, superb churches, the Astronomical Clock, some seriously good restaurants and beautiful and brightly-hued buildings that outdo even Brussels' Grande Place. Huge crowds gather to witness the quite (and literally) moving spectacle of the 12 Apostles who appear in procession every hour on the hour of the clock, itself a marvel of astronomy and engineering. The clock itself was created in 1490, and is housed in a Tower constructed more than 150 years earlier: it's that sort of history that is so moving. If you're feeling energetic, you can climb the Tower, for a fee, to obtain stunning views over the Old City.In the middle of the square is the monument to the martyred Jan Hus, who was burnt at the stake for heresy in 1415. Further around the square is the St Nicholas Church, elaborately decorated in the Baroque style and featuring not only a huge crystal chandelier in the shape of the Russian Tsarist crown but was given by Czar Nicholas II himself. The Church hosts many frequent concerts and recitals, including especially organ recitals, at either 1700 (Tuesday-Sunday) or 2000 (Friday-Monday). Outdoing St Nicholas in splendour is the Gothic twin-spired Church of Our Lady before Tyn, which houses the tomb of the celebrated Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (who died in 1601). The church has many beautiful and sumptuously gilded chapels and also hosts orchestral concerts. But note that it is closed to tourists between 1300-1500 and whenever Mass is being celebrated. Be aware that unscrupulous taxi touts near the St Nicholas Church are ever ready to rip off the unsuspecting tourists with unmetered taxis. Rely ONLY on the AAA taxis, all of which are metered."

At the food stalls along the side of the square opposite Tyn church, my mother tried to buy a 100g portion of ham but the cashier woman saw the 500ck note in her hand and cut her a 400+ ck portion without telling her and, after receiving the note, only gave back a handful of change. My mother then repeated she only wanted 100g but the cashier refused to refund. She blamed my mother for having bad English and not being clearer with how much she wanted and for not recognizing the size of a 100g portion while her coworkers laughed at us. We got very angry and found a policewoman at the square however the policewoman decided to side with the stall people and actually got all sarcastic and also insulted my mother's English before leaving.I was just shocked. The stall people were bad enough but the policewoman actually allowed them to take advantage of tourists knowingly! This made me very disappointed with the Czech police force and it made me feel angry, sad, and helpless. So I recommend you stay clear of these lying cheating business people as much as you can, and when you have to deal with them, always keep your money out of sight until you have asked clearly how much you have to pay and hand exact fare whenever possible or they'll just keep the change and you won't be able to do anything since the police are not only incompetent but corrupt. This happens in restaurants too."

Not to be confused with the Church of St. Nicholas found across the river in the Mala Strana district, there is another famous church in Prague called the Church of St. Nicholas, which is found directly on the Old Town Square. This is smaller church, styled in Baroque architecture that has been on the square since 1735, built upon the grounds of a much older Gothic church from the 13th century. Inside you can see an impressive chandelier that helps provide lighting for the nice ceiling frescos and stucco decor. The Church of St. Nicholas is also used for nightly concerts which can be purchased at the door upon entry. In the end, while not one of our favourite church visits in the city, it is easy to stop by and see the Church of St. Nicholas on the Old Town Square. We spent no more than 15 minutes during our visit. Other attractions on the Old Town Square, which you can visit as well include the very nice Church of the Virgin Mary before Tyn, the Goltz-Kinsky Palace, the Jan Hus Statue as well as the Old Town Hall building, where you find Orlog - The 'Astronomy Clock'."

Unfortunately Prague was \"discovered\" some years ago and crowds are ubiquitous (just one example - groups of young people wearing Prague Pub Crawl shirts come out at night). The best time to take in the architecture on the square is early in the day. Later in the day sit at one of the square-side restaurants and enjoy the wonderful Czech beer. Go some distance off the square to eat where the prices will be better."

The service was good, the waiter helpful and attentive to our empty glasses. I ordered the goulash and dumplings and my wife the pike perch risotto. Both were good, as was the beer and wine.

I wish we'd stayed in a hotel closer to this square, then we would've spent more time here, but we were a fair way out unfortunately. We had a fabulous night in Old Town Square - it is picturesque and there is so much to do, plenty of places to eat and shop. The surrounding streets are gorgeous. We climbed up the tower where the Astronomical Clock is, and that was great as it gave us wonderful views of Prague and especially over Old Town Square.

To us of to the majority of on-lookers.... It was obvious that a lot of folks didn't feel the wait was worthwhile.Whilst we were in Prague we noticed with interest the building of a stage in the square centre - it turned out that a jazz festival was to take place there on the Thursday night.

There's always multiple music performances, magic shows, or just sit and people watch! Just being near the Tyn church was amazing, just breathtaking. There's also the famous Astronomical Clock in the square as well which is always packed.

Which makes sense, however I wasn't really happy with all the shops and attractions nearby. Every second shop was a tacky souvenir stores for kms. If just one of those stores had specialised in something more authentic to Prague rather than cheap artefacts I'm sure that they would make an absolute killing. It was not what I had expected and I found that it ruined the experience quite a bit. I found that I could appreciate Prague if I looked upwards, above the hoards of tourists (not discounting myself as one) and above all the cheap shops along the streets. The architecture is truly magnificent."

Prague doesn't have impressive indoor Market Halls, unlike Budapest's shabby grandeur, only Open Air ones - so if you're a fan of Markets I'd not visit except at Christmas when you get three for your money - the big Christmas Market in Old Town Square - big, fun and busy - a smaller version in Wenceslas Square plus the regular Market one on Havelske (operates all year round). Good value trip thanks to WizzAir from Luton as the Czechs had the good sense to stay out of the Euro. Prague is worth visiting in any event but the extra variety at Christmas time makes it special. Don't agree with other reviewers criticism of Havelske as just selling touristy trinkets - maybe they visited at another time when the Christmas traders weren't there. Neat and tidy and compact - but the local gen. is to stay away in early January when the place fills up with Russians on hols over the Orthodox New Year. Not the most popular visitors with the Czechs but they'll take their money with a smile. The remarkably-quiet lap dancing club under our hotel seemed to be training its girls in anticipation. Prague now seems to be unfashionable for yobbo stag weekends and found an excellent Bierkeller but too plastered to remember the name."

In the afternoon, street performers show off to gather crowds and they are generally entertaining. Then there are the random musicians that may warrant a few coins. There were only a few beggars. There is a Bohemian clock that delivers an entertaining performance t the \"top\" of every hour. You can't miss it because huge crowds form about 10 to the hour (watch your pockets).

I especially like it early in the morning when the businesses are setting up, and late at night when it's less crowded, but more entertaining. The astromical clock is fun if you happen to be passing by around the top of the hour, but I'm not sure it's worth a special trip. The square is surrounded by many old and historically significant buildings. I would suggest picking one of those buildings each day to visit and get a closer look. Chances are you will be passing through the square several times over the course of a Prague trips, so savour it rather than plow through it."

Dinner was also included but we ran late and had to rush through the historic Jewish quarters and the Jewish museums and cemetery were closed. I think we probably should have bagged one of the churches (after a while they all look alike) and spent more time in the Jewish quarter.

For a small fee, go up the tower and you can get a good view of Prague. There is a tourist information office in the Old Town Square where you can pick up brochures. We found an unusual one - tour of a nuclear war bunker. It was simply amazing entering the bunker 16m underground and seeing the equipment kept there in preparation for a nuclear attack. Most of them are still in their original packaging.We found Old Town Square to be relatively safe. There is strong Police presence at the entrances but still watch out for pickpockets when everyone is engrossed watching the clock when it strikes at the hour. There are bathrooms at the tourist information office but take note that you have to pay to use it. Think it is about 0.50 euro."

We enjoyed just sitting, chatting and watching people walk by. Being from America, we realized that Europeans know how to live much better than we do. Many Czechs come to the square to have a nice dinner and walk around. So many people walking! The Square is not open to cars, but we couldn't figure out where everyone was walking to. The Square is often filled with people, whether at 14:00 on a Tuesday afternoon or Saturday night or even at 02:00 in the morning. People always walking around. It was a real joy to do people-watching. You might expect to get a lot of weirdos but we didn't see any. Our attention was more drawn to the young couples dressed up beautifully, especially the women. Many of them wear high heels even though the Square is filled with cobblestones. No one seems to get tripped up.Several reviewers have mentioned the horses and carriages. We had no desire to ride in them, but we enjoyed watching them come past again and again. The horses were adorned with feathers and fancy reins and the carriages were beautiful. We felt it was probably appropriate that we should pay them for riding by! (Although we didn't offer...)Old Town Square is a can't miss attraction in Europe. Prices in Prague are still reasonable, certainly cheaper than what we pay in Ohio at restaurants or bars. Probably 20-40% less than USA prices. Now is the time to go to Prague, folks. Watching a country emerge from communism in fits and starts and becoming a European star is a once-in-a-lifetime thing."

You should explicitly tell them that you want 100g or 200g of potatoes otherwise they will fill up the bowl above the top and charge you more than any other restaurant.

Stunningly beautiful architecture, the ever-popular Astronical Clock that attracts vast crowds on the hour every hour and the surprisingly good food and drink on the terraces.What struck me most is how clean and civilised the square feels. Although it gets very crowded particularly at weekends, the atmosphere is friendly and relaxed.Even the street music is a few notches better than in other cities. During my four-day stay there was a pianist playing Chopin, a jazz quartet and a trio consisting of two tubas and a trumpet.There are little stalls selling beer, ham and sausages, but they discreetly placed around the side of the old town hall and lack the pungent smells of hotdog stalls in London or New York.The whole square is pedestrianised, which is fantastic. Transport in the form of horse and carriage, Segways, 8-seater bicycles and other unusual modes of transport is still everywhere - and great fun too.Many of the terraces are owned by the same handful of companies, so whether you opt for Italian pasta or the steaks next door you are likely to be served food and drink with the same, surprisingly high standards. We loved Olivia Verde, whereas the terrace outside hotel U Prince is disappointingly hit and miss in both food and service.The roof terrace bar and restaurant at U Prince is, however, a hidden gem open to non-residents and possibly one of the finest spots to leisure away an hour or so overlooking Old Town Square.The square lacks the amplified music and pushy vendors that blight many other major tourist destinations. Of course Old Town Square has its problems too, with pickpockets, currency exchange fraudsters and rip-off attempts by dodgy taxi drivers. But it has so much going for it that on balance Old Town Square has to be highly recommended."

Old town is pretty interesting but I must admit that I had two bad experiences and of course the 12 Apostles /astronomical clock was just plain amazing when you consider that it was built in the 1400's and survived WWII with a little rebuilding. Here's a great tip for the clock. Plan to stay for two top of the hours so you can experience once at ground level (large crowds) then immediately go inside and ride the elevator to the top and experience it from atop the tower. Not only is it one of the best views of the city you'll also heard the trumpet play from all four sides which is exactly as they did back in the 1400's.Now for the two bad experiences....Prague like any new capitalistic city is suffering from growing pains and with that there are those who take advantage of situations. First problem was my daughter had her iPhone pick pocketed from her. We seem to always guard against money thief when we travel but not as much on material items. Be on your guard at all times because some people are trying to catch you not paying attention. Second problem was at a currency conversion store. I want to cash $300.00 US into Czech money. Even though old town is NOT the best place to convert, my family want to purchase some items so I laid down my money at a store that said no commission and 19.1 to $1.00. HOWEVER he only handed me back 12 to 1. When I questioned him we acted like he didn't understand and said \"ok you drive hard bargain I give you 16 to 1. I said you give me 19.1 or nothing he then handed the rest over. Bottomline, always know what the conversion rate IS and do the calculation of what you expect back BEFORE you start to hand over any money because that would have been a $100.00 + mistake if I had been paying attention!! Highly recommend the clock and old town."

People start arriving at least 20minutes prior, jostling for a good spot to watch the 12 apostles come into view and \"Death\" ring his bell!There is plenty to watch in the square - musicians and all kinds of buskers, and just people watching.There are food stalls in the square selling local specialities, and there are also retail shops, jewellery (lots of amber and garnets for sale), hand painted eggs, marionettes, and plenty of souvenirs.Whatever you do, make sure that you pay the 100kr to go up to the top of the town hall.

One of three prime tourist spots in Prague along with the Castle District and Charles Bridge area, the Old Town Square is a very good area to spend time while visiting Prague. The most important attraction on the square is Orloj, also known as the Astronomical Clock. If you visit on the hour, you can watch 'The Walk of the Apostles' hourly performance. It is additionally worth visiting the easily recognisable Church of the Virgin Mary before Tyn, which features the two medevel towers topped with four small spires each. The baroque era Church of Saint Nicholas is worth a visit as is the Jan Has Monument in the center of the square. There are plenty of cafes, bars, restaurants and souvenir shops in and around the square as well and if you visit during a holiday period like Christmas or Easter you can enjoy the fairs that are often had in the square. Some permanent stands are set up within the square that sell sausages, trdelniks, drinks and some souvenirs. Overall, this is a nice area to spend some time in the city center of Prague, a place that all visitors to the city should try to find when they visit the city."

Most important of all, however, is that the square is quite unique in Europe as one rarely gets to see architecture and style of different centuries in any other place. Standing there and just turning slowly, gives an overview which cannot be seen elsewhere. If you are fortunate, you can see the famous clock in action, but I cannot recall the times (I guess every hour on the hour?)."

After you've visited Prague Castle, seen St Vitus Cathedral and soaked up the atmosphere of the Charles Bridge, you'll want to walk through Old Town Prague to Old Town Square. This is a fascinating place. It's surrounded by centuries-old buildings of various architectural styles, and in the center is the statue of Jan Hus, an early contributor to the Protestant Reformation. On one corner is the beautiful St. Nicholas Church. On another corner is the Old Town Hall Tower and the 600 year old Astronomical Clock. At the approach of the top of each hour you'll see a crowd gather below the clock to watch Christ and the twelve apostles appear, and to hear the hour tolled by the skeleton of death. This happens quickly, so don't allow yourself to be distracted.There are numerous restaurants and cafes along the sides of the square, and the most crowded Starbucks I have ever seen. I visited the square on the weekend before Easter, and it was full of wooden vendor's huts, like you see at Christmas Markets in European cities. Happy people, and good ethnic food and drink plus all kinds of trinkets for sale.If you're up for more walking and window shopping, one of the streets leading off the square is Parizska Street, the high-end shopping street. Here you'll find Christian Dior, Prada, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton and more."

A tourist trap with numerous bars and restaurants, be warned if you sit down you will automatically get a cover charge (\u00a32pp) and if ordering food or drink they add charges for bread (\u00a35) and add an automatic service charge. The famous 500 year old Astronomical Clock chimes from 0900 till 2200 on the hour with the Saints on display and sometimes a trumpeter will join in from the Tower above. Very congested at these times, watch-out for pick pockets. Only try the Prague Ham from local vendors if you like gristly ham, beware as they charge for it by each 100g (our lunch cost \u00a330 and ended up mostly feeding the local beggars) and also the local donut rings which are expensive at \u00a31.70 each (50Kr).

We visited whilst the Easter markets were there, meaning there was a profusion of little stalls selling hot wine, beer, non-alcoholic drinks, hot and cold food and lots of souvenirs and assorted goods, with plenty of tacky things and plenty of beautiful things too!As with everywhere in Prague, it is a little 'rough around the edges' - watch your footing, wear flat-ish shoes you can walk in, beware of cobbles and accept that shop shutters will likely have a little graffitti on them. That said, it doesn't take away from the atmosphere of the place - don't get conned by the tourist-trap restaurants (there are plenty of great ones so if you sit down and don't like the menu or prices, get up and go to another one or try a few side streets) but do grab a coffee, take a seat and people-watch, or take one of the free walking tours. It is a beautiful, historical city with stunning buildings and this is one of the best places to see some great examples.If you're here already, after taking a look at the Astrological Clock (be there on the hour!) make sure you head along Celetn\u00e1 to see Powder Gate or head down Pa\u0159\u00ed\u017esk\u00e1 into the old Jewish town, to window shop at the (exceedingly expensive) designer shops and take in the Old Jewish Cemetary."

Prague Old Town Square is a mixture of wonderful architecture, high culture and rampant tourist trap!The great things about it are well documented in other reviews on here but a lot of the seedy stuff isn't.Litter and graffiti is quite bad, and a few of the cobbles in the Square and surrounding streets are loose or missing.We had no problems whilst we were here and neither should you if you're careful with where you keep your money stashed out of harm's way, and avoid the hawkers, vendors that don't advertise their prices and expensive tourist trap bars and restaurants.I was initially nervous about having to carry our passports at all times (you can be fined for not doing so) and large amounts of money for food and drink, entrance fees and shopping purchases etc but we were fine after taking sensible precautions.Did see one police arrest but considering the crowds and the setting I was amazed at the lack of visible crime and the low key police presence (plain clothes police are on patrol and do seem to do a good job.We saw beggars prostrate on the ground with hands outstretched but then it was Easter and maybe its a tradition - alms for the poor and all that. At least they weren't aggressive though and didn't pester you.It's also amazing how people will debase themselves for money, from living statues to the black gentleman with the marracas, to a late middle aged man dressed as a native American Indian doing a war dance! Still, one man's people with no dignity doing anything for money is another man's \"local colour\" so you take your pick. Not all of the vendors are rip-off merchants, some are good value and you know what you are paying upfront so you can't tar them all with the same brush. Equally, not all of the establishments on the square are expensive - again, you take your choice and pay your money - but even going 2 minutes away from the square brings the reward of top quality great value food and drink.The astronomical clock is so-so but let's face it you're gonna go and see it anyway so make your own mind up. Going up the Clock tower is a good experience though if you're ok with heights and getting jostled a bit, and the Mucha exhibition is excellent in a very understated way. We didnt do the Dali exhibition in the same building though, maybe next time we are in Prague!We felt safe throughout in Prague, which really is a beautiful city.All-in-all, use your common sense and you should be fine. Don't stand in one place for too long or get into conversations with any of the hawkers or give anyone the opportunity to rob you. Keep your bag closed and in sight at all times, and any serious money in a zipped inside jacket or bag pocket - that's my advice, otherwise enjoy the Square (and the city) for what it is."

The markets at Christmas and Easter are worth a visit but equal the square is worth a visit at any time. If you visiting the square I would recommend you have lunch up on the terraceIn the U Prince for the most breathtaking views. Make sure to bring your camera!!!"

If you're looking to get your bearings and reach important tourist destinations throughout the city, the square can be particularly useful due to its large size and unique buildings. Be wary of the astronomical clock, which will bring huge crowds every hour. Most of the goods sold by vendors are remarkably overpriced, and can be found cheaper throughout the city. Unless you really need to pick up a souvenir quickly, avoid buying here. For reference, Old Town Square is a roughly 10 minute walk from Charles Bridge, only a few dozen meters from the Powder Gate, and about 20 minutes from Prague Castle and St. Vitus Cathedral."

Even though it was a week before Easter, the markets were in full swing, with competitions and entertainment on stage, fresh sausage on buns for sale, hot drinks, and the ever present, yummy, cooked dough with almonds and sugar. Yum! I also really enjoyed seeing the hand decorated Easter eggs of all sizes and colours for sale. As this square is central to pretty much everything, and as pretty much all tour groups go through to see the fabulous old clock, it can get a little crowded at the top of the hour. Still, it was wonderful.Of the entertainment that was specifically for Easter, I enjoyed seeing the local girls doing a traditional dance; as well, I found the oyster shucking competition wonderfully entertaining.If you can get to the square for Easter, then its definitely worth the visit."

We went in the evening at about 7pm and it looks so magical all lit up with the market stalls. The magic also continues throughout the day when evenmore market stalls are open and you can really explore the side streets. A lot of tours also start from this area making it a great place to go on your first day in Prague!"

In Old Town Square - which I loved before - one is now pestered by individuals asking 'Do you want to change money?. DON'T - it's a scam. Then (there a lovely Easter market) I was tapped on the shoulder by a stall holder 'Your bag is open. Zip it up, you must not have it open in Prague'. the zip on my back pack was slightly ajar. Then the vagrants! It was common to see the down- and-outs circulating the Old Town Square, dipping into the waste paper baskets and eating (and indeed drinking) anything they could find. One felt very uneasy.The market was lovely, the Clock still fun, but Prague has changed. Not for the better I am sorry to say."

A large market, based in the central area around the fountain, with many cafes and bars around the sides.The down side here is prices and unsavoury folk here too. Your Pilsner is going to cost you between 60-100 CZK here, (\u00a32-\u00a33.50) As a comparison 1or2 streets back, the most expensive Pilsner I had was 59CZK, and in many places I regularly got it between 25-36CZK (\u00a30.90-\u00a31.25) People will say, thats what you pay for central prices, but when you consider these cheaper prices were within 2minutes of the centre, and you get real czech experience, please make the effort. If you read my other reviews, I will list a few real czech puns worth visiting.The other bad thing here is the Pimps handing out flyers for strippers, or calling cards for hookers, and on occasion the hookers themself approaching us...for young lads thats ok, but they were appraoching men, with women and kids...which is brutal. so, its only getting a very good i am afraid."

The clock chimes every hour and after reading that the hourly 'perfermance' was a must see we agreed that we should see it at least once. We caught it twice and to be honest it was a bit still a must over hyped...but still a must see. It is interesting to watch and understand the history of the clock. "

Avoid buying \"Old Prague Ham\" from the street food booths. It's a total rip-off and they'll try to give you a piece that costs at least 500K\u010d.

From walking along a 1,000 years old footpath which was the first paved footpath in Prague, to enjoying a \"pig on a spit roast\" meal in a 700 year old original cavern hewn from rock, nothing matches the charm, romance and sheer ingenuity of this quaint intact living history lesson.Take the free walking tour from under the Astronomical clock at either 11am or 2pm daily for a 3hr journey backwards in time. It's hard to decide where to look as every building is a different design and is a different colour and every footpath has varying patterns designed and made by hand, centuries ago. A hint for the free walking tours is to stay up front with the tour guide and ask lots of questions. These guys (and gals) are a wealth of information and you learn so much from them. Sure, you are asked to give a tip...do so...it's well worth it. Then offer to take them to lunch or for a beer afterwards...heaps more info here too!Prague is a never ending treasure trove of discovery...for instance, the cavern restaurant I mentioned earlier.I accidentally discovered it whilst standing near a hot Gl\u00fchwein stall, just opposite the Astronomical Clock, in Old Town Square, sipping my hot spiced wine (30cz, about $1.50) while it was snowing.I noticed steps going down to somewhere, so down I went.Imagine my surprise as I entered the dimly lit cavern and was transported back to the Viking days of Asterix, Gettafix and those comic characters my boys grew up loving!There was a wild boar, a bear, fox, birds, owls, bats, deer antlers and many types of stuffed (real) animals decorating the walls.It was a thrill to wander down there and imagine the past days of 700 years of continual eating in this tavern/cavern/restaurant.Then I wandered into the big back dining hall and decided a roast pig on a spit was a must do in this unique setting once I saw where they actually roast the pig! Only about 300cz for a 3 course meal too. That's about $15 Ausd...At Xmas time the Square is transformed into fairy land with the addition of the beautiful Xmas markets with all the little twinkling stalls selling hot wine, cinnamon rolls, special continental sausage, fresh wild Prague (smoked in front of your eyes fresh) pork rolls and a multitude of European Xmas goodies we never get to see in Australia.A fairy tale adventure for kids of all ages."

I and my friends went there around 9:30am. To my surprise, the square was almost empty, excluding the customers from the nearby cafes. So we took our time slowly there, snapping pictures and posing with the Orloj. I couldn't think of any word to describe this place except 'ah-mazing'!"

There may be grander squares elsewhere, but for the complete package of stunning architecture spanning centuries, a huge selection of shops, bars, and restaurants, and above all the lively and colourful atmosphere, Old Town Square is hard to beat. It was further enhanced on this occasion by the Christmas market that was still in full swing with the smell of roast ham, roast chestnuts, and mulled wine wafting temptinlgy across the square. Despite the crowds we felt safe and comfortable most of the time, except perhaps at midnight on New Year's Eve when it did get rather rowdy."

We went to a hot meat stall for some ham and were offered this huge plate (we weren't asked what size) for 2000 crowns!!! As it was sold by the 100g, we asked if we could have a smaller portion. We were just told 'this is a normal portion' - so we walked away.The square does seem to be constantly crowded, so if crowds annoy you then try pick a time when it may be quieter.I can imagine it's beautiful in the summer time too."

At the market, most of the items for sale can also be had elsewhere in the city for lower prices and much less crowded shopping. All that being said (and sounding negative) if you're visiting Prague this is a must-go place to see the architecture and imagine what it was perhaps like before it became packed with toursits from every corner of the globe."

The stalls are selling what you can buy in the shops, often cheaper, and the store owners will drop their prices, but thankfully don't chase after you if you decide not to buy. The mulled wine and honey wine were lovely. Thought the stores would have been selling more of a variety. Overall I was disappointed."

Every hour the clock puts on a little animated show and then a live trumpeter sounds a fanfare from the top of the tower. We missed the Christmas Market by a couple of days, but it looked to be spectacular. Lots of free tours start from the square, we chose the Sandemans New Prague Tours (they wear red coats/jumpers) and they were excellent."

We would be hard-pressed to find many events in the city's history that do not involve Old Town Square. It has been the site of several unfortunate and tragic occasions: on June 21, 1621, it was here that 27 representatives of the anti-Habsburg insurrection were executed; the Old Town Hall was nearly destroyed at the end of World War Two when the Nazis set fire to it; and in February 1948, from the balcony of the Golz-Kinsky Palace, Klement Gottwald announced the Communist Party's successful coup. However, the square's \u201cdark side\u201d has never robbed it of its rich vibrancy and festivities.This square was exceptional both during the day and at night. Felt totally safe. Every direction you look is stunning. It does get busy though especially on the hour... Plenty of places for eating. Side streets great for exploring."

There were still many people this time of year but not wall-to-wall. The striking architecture, churches, and buildings steeped in history, this is truly one of the loveliest and most beautiful places I've been in Europe. This is the site of many historic moments in Prague and Czech history.The centerpiece of the square is the statue of the martyr, Jan Hus, burned as a heretic in 1415.The Tyn Church dominates one side of the square with its two Gothic towers that can be seen throughout Prague. It is surrounded by smaller buildings that lead to the square. Across the square is the beautiful St Nicholas Church is in the Baroque style. At one corner of the square is the Old Town Hall - buildings that were added on to the Old Town Hall Tower over the years. On one side of the tower is the magnificent Astronomical Clock; it really is worth it to stop during on the hour and see this masterpiece from the 1300s in all its glory. (The Town Hall faces the square, the clock is around the corner - get there a bit early to get a good viewing spot).The skeleton (representing death) begins the hour by ringing a bell, symbolizing that death waits for no one. The twelve apostles then proceed out and and a rooster crows at the end.TIP: After your finished watching the clock, look behind you. There is a crystal shop. They have free restrooms! (unadvertised, so you have to know about it). Enter from the square or from the little alley, turn right at the stairs (go straight past the stairs if you enter from the alley) and there you are!As you're facing the clock, note the big brown door/archway to the left in the adjacent building. Fridays and Saturdays are big wedding days in Prague and this is a famous door through which new brides and grooms pass through for pictures. There are many vendor stands where you can get a cup of hot wine, hot chocolate, or coffee, as well as meats,sandwiches, and other snacks. This adds to the festive marketplace atmosphere of the square, Which, after all, was what it used to be.Keeping the Old Town Hall on your left and the square on your right, head across the square and up Parizska to the Jewish Quarter and the famous Jewish Cemetery (you could also hang a left on Kaprova), just a few minutes walk. As you pass the Old Town Hall, note the crosses on the sidewalk that represent the 27 executed leaders of the rebellion against Emperor Matthias in 1621. Legend has it that their ghosts return every year on June 21st, the anniversary of the executions.Or, continue walking out of the square past the Astronomical Clock, make your way to Karlova,and on to Charles Bridge. There are lovely shops and charming streets.There are cobblestones everywhere so if you do nothing else, where appropriate footwear so you can enjoy it. I also found a golf cart tour (I believe tucked away behind the National Gallery) and arranged for a tour of the Old Town area. It was 50 euro (1200KC) for a little over an hour tour. She came and picked 4 of us up at the Hilton and would have dropped us there as well, but we elected to be dropped off at Republik Square for a look around and then walk back. This is an EXCELLENT option for those who might have a little trouble walking as you can see many of the sites of Old Town and Jewish Quarter. The golf cart seats 5 and the cost is for the tour - not per person. We felt it was worth it. There are blankets for chillier days - we took advantage of them on that cold afternoon. Although they advertised that they took credit cards, at the end of our tour she said the credit card machine was broken and we would have to pay cash. We had not been in town very long and hadn't come prepared with Euros so had to go to an ATM while she waited - pretty big inconvenience. We found that a lot in Prague -reluctance to take credit cards. This tour was still worth it though and I would recommend it. HOWEVER - you do not actually see the Astronomical Clock on the golf cart tour, so arrange to see that separately or get dropped off there. Since the clock face doesn't face the square, it can't be seen from the golf cart."

The Astronomical Clock does it's bit on the hour, followed by a trumpet encore. The food stalls are varied and reasonably priced, a beer and a pork sandwich will cost about 200 crowns. The street entertainers are very good although the horses that congregate in the squuare smell a wee bit! There are lots of small cafe's, where you can sit outside under patio heaters with a blanket if its chilly. It is a beautiful place at night, all the building are lit up, and the atmosphere is excellent."

One day when I visited last year there were well over a hundred artists there with their easels and many were painting or drawing the scenery around the. Another time there was a girl holding up a sign that said: \"Free hugs\". You can be sure I got one! And there are almost always buskers in the square entertaining the spectators. Another landmark, the Astronimical Clock, is on one end of the square and there are two magnificent churches overlooking the square. On one side of the square there is a large monument to Jan Huss, who was the founder of he Protestant movement in Bohemia. Both the Charles Bridge and Republic Square are located about a half mile from Old Town Square in opposite directions."

Do a miss on the restaurants along the perimeter, they're too expensive and many offer inferior food with even worse service. The Old Town Clock is worth watching once at the top of the hour. Visit the square as the sun comes up and you'll have the whole square practically to yourself. It's breathtaking to see the sun peak through the buildings and cast long shadows across the cobbled square. Visit it between mid-morning and late evening and you'll be one of thousands doing the same thing. Visit it after dark and you'll be amazed at the beautiful lighting of the square itself and all the surrounding buildings."

However when you order you cannot specify the weight that you want. According to the seller they go by \"portions\". Each portion was supposed to be 300-400g.

You should stand in its middle (if you are lucky to be able to do so because of the crowd of tourists) and bake a 360 degree-look around the square. If you love architecture and monuments you will be in awe! Awesome Square. But not a place to eat, drink or buy souvenirs. This is a tourist trap"

And the palachinkes (big crepes) made on site... sooo good! They also sell wine and spirits and will give you samples to try. We liked their cider but it magically turned into moonshine when we arrived home, I'm not kidding, it's so strong that I can also have a sip at a time. I keep it in the freezer so it won't go bad. We also picked up a couple of bottles of their honey wine, this one is so delicious and you can totally taste the honey. The Square has everything to spend several hours touring around, then coming back for a bite and a drink, have a rest, then keep exploring the surrounding sites.

The buildings that surround the square are magnificent and if you want to do some serious buying or window shopping then walk along `Parizska` or Paris St just off the main square.

But, be forewarned, you pay significantly more to eat outside than you do inside of the restaurant. The menu shows you the indoor prices to lure you in and the waiter doesn't always mention to you the price differential up front. Also, typically in Czech, when the waiter brings you the bill they expect to be paid on the spot and also to receive the tip on the spot. Don't leave the tip on the table - someone else will take it! The going rate for tipping in Czech is 5%-10%. The service is less than the service in America, yet the waiters often expect an American-sized tip when waiting on an American. Tip as you see fit."

It is easy to reach by subway or tram and you can spend a whole afternoon there, walking around, having a coffee or lunch in one of the many restaurants and cafes in the square. Souvenir shops seem to be a bit less expensive than the ones around Charles Bridge and Prague Castle."

I wouldn't reccomend to have a lunch or dunner in caffes near-by as most of them are \"touristic\" (in the bed way) places and you would not feel warm czech welcome as you can feel if you'll make only few steps away and get into tangled maze of narrow streets tied around Old Town Square."

It got quite crowded during the day ( the Europe Cup soccer was also going on!), but we enjoyed it most early morning ( before 10 AM) and late night ( after 10PM). Infact after 10PM when the crowds have gone and the buildings are lit ( especially the Tyn Church), the place looks like magical disney land. We loved it there. Fortunately it is in the center of Prague, so we had to criss-cross it several times during our stay - we loved it.

Guarded by the Power gate from the 11th century, churches and towers and most important the astronomical clock, then you should visit this place first.I found reaching there a bit tricky as you have to cross some small narrow lanes but once up there I really liked it. The city tour of buses and cruise leave from the place. Hop into one of them if you have limited time. It will really take you to places in a short time.DO not forget to get you loved ones a sovinour which I found really cheap in Prague (EURO 2). Food is good and cheap compared to paris or amsterdam etc. The beauty of this small places is that the common people really knows a lot of languages and you will not face any trouble."

In Winter it is filled with stalls selling all sorts of gifts and food and in the Summer it is packed with tourists. Events are often held there, so check before you go and you may catch something interesting. But even without events, it is a magical place. The only drawback can be the amount of people milling around there, especially when the astronomical clock is about to chime. But for some this may just add to the experience."

The trumpeter on top of the tower appeared on the hour (until 7pm )and he was a real cheery chappie, waving to everyone in his fancy costume, when he had finished his solo.The tower opens into a large square with an interesting statue in the centre. As we walked around the statue we were struck by the number of exits from the square. We took one and found ourselves in the old Peacock Inn which claims that the Iron Chancellor, Bismark, had used its facilities when it was a house of ill-repute.

Don't miss to have a look at the Astronomical Clock (it's on the wall of Old Town City Hall - every hour you can see the figures (apostles) moving, while the Death (the skeleton) strikes the time, now there is a trumpeter under the roof playing the trumpet every hour I think. There are a lot of caf\u00e9s on the square, but these are really expensive, I would definitely recommend to go to some of the little streets around the square and everything will be cheaper there! You can visit the Sant Nicolas Church, it's free, very peaceful and refreshingly cold in hot summer.

Plus it has the most awful cobbles, in which respect it is not much different from the rest of central Prague. Beware the restaurants around the edge as well as the usual tat shops.Raise your eyes to the architectural delights above the square. On one side the Church of our Lady of Tyn. This is a late Gothic construction whose towers are such a strange and elaborate feature. Old houses have been built up very close to the front and all down the side of the church so it is only the spires that can be readily seen from any distance. Then on the other side is the main church and when we were there, among the ranks of badly dressed tourists, were lots of young people who were dressed so well they may have been a wedding party. On the other side of the square is the famous astronomical clock on the town hall. Maybe I'm getting cynical in my old age but I did not think it that special. I found the masses of people gazing up at it as it struck the hour, far more interesting to look at. "

We spent about a week in Prague and found ourselves constantly marvelling at the picuresque sorroundings of Prague's old town square!The astronomical clock is a must see, the cobblestone walkways and bustling crowds really make this the true heart of Prague! Plenty of shopping, bars and restaurants in a close vicinity to the area, so a great place to meet up with people and head off from there!Be warned though, the square is NOT a good place to eat or drink though. The mouth-watering ham spits are ridiculously over-priced, so avoid the temptation! The restaurants around the edges of the square will charge at least double that of restaurants a short walk away from the main square, and due to the busy crowds, pick pockets are apparently very successful here, so be mindful of your valuables.We didn't encounter any theft etc in Prague, and the police presence is constant so leaves you feeling quite safe most of the time. The only negative encounter we had in Prague was the ham spit roasts which cost us about 50 Euro for a sandwich (converted into Czech Coruna)."

I heard that there are a lot of pick-pockets, I do believe it as the place is crowded, however, I was not subjected, not did I see anyone being subjected to any such activity. The street food in the square, as well as in the old town is decent. The architecture of the surrounding structures is beautiful. The old town square is a must see, day and night.

Nearly all the food on offer is advertised as a certain price PER 100g...for example the lovely smoked ham that is so temptingly on offer was 89 Koruna (\u00a32.50)...however the sellers will simply serve up whatever portion they feel like (the more gulliable you look the larger it will be) and expect you to pay for it...they tried to serve us over 600g and charge us something close to \u00a315!! This is the case with a lot of the food there, I saw a family of 3 get charged over \u00a325 for some potato and cheese when they originally thought they'd be paying something like \u00a34/5...very very overpriced and diliberately set up to decieve.Eat elsewhere...and just sit in the square and enjoy the ambience..."

I was pleasantly suprised by how clean and safe the streets are. We started our trip in Paris and for all its beauty the streets are well, filthy - more so around the tourist attractions. Prague is truly beautiful, a large, but subtle police presence, the place just rocks. # days in Prague is plenty to see what you need to and appreciate just how magnificent the city is !!"

It was really easy. In terminal 2 arrivals area you can buy a one day pass for 110k and walk out the doors at exit E. Thr bus 119 takes you to its last stop (about 20 minutes from airport). Then you get on the metro for three stops and presto you are meters away from st Charles bridge. It is very much worth it to see old town Prague- it is one of the most beautiful squares in Europe. I'm so glad I saw a little bit of this beautiful city."

We were fortunate to travel while the Easter Market was occuring (3/26-4/15), so were were able to enjoy all the food booths, and also numerous craft and gift vendors. When we arrived at first, these were not yet present, but the square was just as enchanting. The astronomical clock is stunning, and the crowds form on the hour to witness the apostles appear from the doors above, and hear the trumpeter from the tower. There are a number of cafes and restaurants around the perimeter, with prices inflated a bit, but still manageable.The Church of Our Lady of Tyn that really marks the square, is such a spectacular sight. It is just so storybook and charming, and is breathtaking by day, and magical in the night lighting. So much of Prague is accessible by foot, and we found this a perfect location to call home. So thankful we chose this area for our accomodations!"

But that aside, the square is a place we really loved going to and did so twice! The astronomical clock is a wonder and apparently it is one of the only 3 clocks which still works in the world! Every hour, the clock comes alive by pointing out the time and then a gentleman in costumes plays the trumpet from the top of the tower to announce the hour as well.

This square is a \"must visit\" in Prague.But, my wife was \"exploited\" by what appears to be very legit money exchange office in the square.They have a very clever (and legal) scam going on generally on money exchange in Prague and you will get ZERO help from the authorities if you fall victim. The scam works like this: You open a brightly lit legit looking \"bureau de change\"-like shop front. Then you exploit the behaviors the tourists expect to encounter at such offices. You offer TWO different rates of exchange for each currency. One is a very normal looking rate, and the other one is about HALF the normal exchange rate. If the customer wants to exchange an amount less than say US$500 you apply the low rate. The customer only discovers the low rate has been applied once the Czech money is handed over and appears to be way less than expected.Thus, people exchanging say US$100, US$50 etc can end up giving half of the their money away, instead of the usual expected 2~5% or commission rate.It's very clever and very exploitative of international travelers' expectations. THERE IS NO CHANCE OF GETTING YOUR MONEY BACK.Shame on the Czech tourist authority for allowing this to continue.Again, DO NOT trust the money exchange bureaus. Go to a bank."

There's nothing to add to the descriptions of this pittoresque place and I totally agree that everybody should visit it at once during the day and also at night. Just wanted to drop a warning that you should best avoid the coffee houses around that spot as it might happen that they charge you prices that are as astronomical as the clock on the square. Ok, common sense that prices are always a bit higher on such spots, but we had to pay 12 EUROS per cup of coffee (!) in one of these establissements on the square. As we complained that this must be a mistake, the manger came (looked rather like a hardcore bouncer) and made firmly clear that each of us had drank a cup and thus had to pay 12 Euro. Not much chance to object when you have such a person in front of you. So this was one misfortune, I don't want to generalise it - be carefull and ask the price beforehand.Else: don't forget to visit the little bookshop on the square that used to belong to the Kafka family. It's a decentbookshop and not at all the tourist trap one does expect."

Perhaps we should have done a bit more research before going."

You're paying to sit in comfort on Old Town Square, and I think it's worth it. Old Town Square is always worth a stroll through, or even a much longer stay. The views from the terrace restaurant of U Prince hotel and from Old Town Hall Tower (the building with the astronomical clock) are spectacular."

When the clock chimes (or at least at 3pm when we saw it), there wasn't much to see. Worth a walk through the old town, but it's very crowded with tourists and the restaurants/cafes looked very busy.

To any of you who go to the xmas market in future be very wary. Rather stupidly I handed over the equivalent of \u00a332-00 to the stall holder when asked.I went back and queried it and needless to say got nowhere. I threw the food back at the stallholder and told him he was having a laugh at \u00a332 for two bits of gammon and 2 slices of bread. I saw many other tourists and locals being ripped off not only at this stall and the advice would be to double check the price before handing a note over to the stall holder which is what the czechs were doing. Not happy then don`t pay. I wish I had just had my wits about me more. My wife and I the went to the trip advisor restaurant off the square called U Mlejnice and had 4 beers, 3 wines, goulash, huge plate of ribs, chipas and veg and paid less ! Don`t be ripped off. I dare say this stall holder will have the same plot next year in the north east corner of the square. You have been warned!"

A market place since the middle ages, it has many of Prague's most beautiful buildings.The 16th-century Prague Astronomical Clock on the Old Town Hall is brilliant. Each hour, from 9am-9pm, crowds gather to see the mechanical statues accompany the chimes, & it's from here that many of the city's walking tours start."

In the evening there was live music - I think that they have themes.

What is it like in summer?The tower is worth going up for a super view of the city although it gets pretty crammed at the top and there is not a one way system in place so you have people squeezing past etc. There is a lift so no need to worry if you have trouble with stairs.You must have a hot wine if you are there when it is cold and just take in the atmosphere.I recommend sitting in the cane chairs in the Hotel U Prince and just relax and watch everyone else bustle pass.Enjoy your trip."

The Old Town Square was decked out in holiday cheer with the Christmas market located there. Aside from the fun of the Christmas market, the architecture and buildings make the square one of the most beautiful squares I've been to. It ranges in style from Baroque to Gothic to Romanesque. Off to the side it has a fun astronomical clock that rings on the hour, with an accompanying trumpeteer at the top of the tower. It can be a bit touristic but that's the fun in it all and certainly doesn't negate the beauty of the square."

We walked past the Rott House with its exquisite, decorative murals and cartoons, and along quaint streets fronted by specialist shops (one the violin shop), until the breathtaking Old Town Square opened up before us. We were again conscious of the large numbers of people gazing in fascination at the beautiful buildings. Timeless and serene in the afternoon sunlight, it was difficult to imagine a day in 1968 when the Russian tanks rolled in during the dramatic Prague Spring.Centre stage, the pink and black walls of the solid Old Town Hall command immediate attention. Adorning its south wall is the very famous Orloj or Astronomical Clock designed by Master Hanus. The huge, golden dials tell not only the time; but also the position of the planets, the equinoxes and the phases of the moon. As each hour strikes, the square fills to capacity. Increased crowds flock to watch the chiming display as two small doors open to reveal scenes of revolving figures. The canvas is rich indeed but two buildings are especially captivating. Rising to the east of the square are the commanding, black spires of the Church of Our Lady Before Tyn. Perhaps this haunting, Bohemian fa\u00e7ade most epitomises Prague? It is strange, medieval and Gothic. And then, in the north-west corner, stands the elegant Baroque church of St Nicholas. It is white; has superb proportions and is capped by delicate, fluted, green spires."

We visited Prague primarily for the Christmas market on the last weekend in November, when there are special festivities for the opening weekend. The market is very picturesque, stunning setting, but compared with markets in Germany stalls are geared to food and drink rather than Christmas goods. A warning - there are stalls selling ham being cooked on big revolving spits, we asked for 2 portions and were charged 600 crowns (over \u00a320) for 2 generous but not outrageously large plates of ham. I remonstrated but since it is carved off the bone in front of you it is difficult to send it back. You can get 2 meals with drinks in a respectable restaurant for 600 crowns - this is a rip-off."

However in the evening we had a lovely meal a few restaurants along which was well worth the money. Our waiter (Martin) was great and the food was excellent and only came to approx \u00a350.00 for 2 people 3 courses plus wine and beer."

Fortunately, they have retained their own currency the Czech Crown, but costs are now in line with other capital cities.Selecting a hotel to stay at in Prague is important as there are only older style hotels in the Old Town and that is where most visitors want to stay.It is important to be within a few minutes walk of Wenceslas Square in the one direction and the Old Town Square and the Charles Bridge in the other direction.The Old Town Square is where everyone congregates all day and late into the night. It is surrounded by small restaurants which are excellent but expensive! Everything in Prague is expensive and couples visiting wiill easily get through Euros 150 a day just to cover meals and drinks.The only bargain in the city are the three Opera Houses where visitors can enjoy opera or baller six nights a week. Tickets for these can easily be booked online and e-tickets printed off in advance. Expect to pay \u00a340 Sterling or 45 Euros for good seats. The champagn bars are available at the interval with a glass of champagne costing about \u00a32 or Euros 2.20.Travel on the Metro system is easy, but the tram system is bewildering and not at all wellsignposted for visitors. We tried to visit Prague Zoo but found transportation to it impossible as it involved a tram ride followed by a bus journey.We will continue to visit Prague for the theatres, but cut the length of stay dramatically!"

The main square in Prague is a definite 'Must See' on any visit to Prague.It can be very busy, especially at the o'clock times - this is because the apostles in the astronomical clock come out of the window in the front of the clock and a trumpeter at the top of the tower blows a salute. This is worth seeing from both inside and outside of the tower.I have heard of pickpockets operating, but didn't notice any suspicious behaviour - this is backed up by a noticeable police presence, and the police are more than happy to help you out with any problems.The main statue was being renovated during my visit so the view was somewhat obscured by some boards, but from the top of the tower it is possible to see the iconic views of Prague including the old gates and Charles Bridge.Jazz is very big in Prague and on a number of occasions there were Jazz bands playing in the town square.I did not eat at the restaurants right on the square, but turning down some side streets there are some EXCELLENT places to eat both main meals and coffee and strudel.If you're going to Prague, you have to visit the old town square"

The Old Town Square is very crowded but well worth the visit. . . . just keep in mind that there are pickpockets wherever you find large numbers of tourists.The CLOCK TOWER is magnificant. Be sure to visit on the hour as the clock strikes the hour. It is amazing that they could design such a clock hundreds of years ago.In the middle of the square you will find a statue of John Huss. John Huss was a \"Martin Luther\" about 100 years before Luther. Back then the Roman Catholic Church had an army and he did too. . . . his army won most of the battles. The Catholic Emperor finally offered him \"safe passage\" and he went to Prague for talks . . . . . He was promptly seized and burned at the stake. His followers have survived and you will find Hussite Monasteries in the Czech Republic.The large Catholic Church to the right of the statue is interesting too. It is built close behind some homes. The idea was to build the church so close that the homeowners would sell for a low price but the economy went bad and it never happened. You have to enter the church through a narrow passage between the houses.Don't skip the old Jewish Quarter that borders the square. . . . . . the area to the rear and right of the John Huss statue. It is well worth exploring. Want to eat? Walk down one of the many narrow streets around the square. Once you are 2 or 3 blocks from the square you will find small restaurants with better food at half the price. Don't forget to try the Czech beer. It's very good!"

There was a large police presence here throughout the day, but we did not see anything untoward happen. The chiming of the Clock on the hour attracted large crowds which were difficult to cope with, but if you tried to get up to one of the 1st floor cafes you would be disappointed because all of the window tables were reserved."

The clock tower and cathedral looked liked Disney World from a thousand years ago. Many tourists from Central Europe and beyond. Made my first day/night in Prague so wonderful. It's a beautiful, ancient city with the Castle, the Charles Bridge and regal palaces everywhere. The evening river boat cruise was such a romantic way to see the city lit up at night. Just so beautiful! If you're not on a budget; go to Kampa Park restaurant next to the Charles Bridge right on the Vlatava River. The best restaurant in Prague."

The must-seen sights are the main square, the astronomical clock, Tyn Cathedral; but there is so much more to see including the Spanish Synagogue and the Estates' Theater."

Yes, half a day full of people, but in the rest you can definitely enjoy it. When in Prague do not only see the city core in afternoon as all the tourists do. Take a walk here in the cold foggy morning when all the tourists are waking up and having breakfasts. Enjoy the atmosphere of Old Town Square where life is emerging and people approaching from all the streets leading here. See the spires of Tyn church in fresh day light and relax sitting on a bench. Than at 8:50 AM go beyond Astronomical clock and after spectacular show at 9:00 AM (when many people are still in hotel bathrooms) can you leave this spot. And then return in the late sunset or in the evening to enjoy the gem of mother of cities.Right on this square you may feel a bit of Czech history - Astronomical clock, Jan Hus monument (let\u2019s call him predecessor of Martin Luther), 27 white crosses representing executed noblemen and than 30 years war, but also Old Town Hall damaged by WWII bombing and do not forget about the opposite side of the square, where Kinsky palace is - just the place where communist announced they seized power in 1948. Everything described and even more you find in the square and if you are lucky enough to enjoy (overcrowded, of course) Christmas markets or Czechs supporting their ice hockey team on world cup, than nothing can break it!PS: Depends on you, but as a Prague citizen I advice you not to spent money in restaurants/shops in that area. There are much cheaper and better opportunities. On Old Town Square you pay them only for the location ;-)"

It has a solar clock, lunar clock, and astrological signs which ring the clock face. An elevator is available and is wheel chair accessible for the viewing gallery at the top of the viewing gallery.

The place was filled with lots of souvenir stores, restaurants, bars, and all those typical stuffs that you will normally see in any tourist spots. However, there are some interesting buildings there too, like the famous astronomical tower, bethlehem chapel and church of our lady. So since you are already in Prague, why not give it a visit? Be sure to climb up the tower to see the beautiful scenery of Prague from the top while you are there. Also another tip, the tower will play a trumpet music every hour (the last hour would be at 9pm), so if you want the visit to this place becomes more worthwhile, be there at the time close to the trumpet play. Last time I was there, it was at 9pm and all the people down the tower clapped their hands after the trumpet music was over. It was a beautiful experience. So though the square itself isn't as interesting as the other attractions in Prague, it is still a worth place to go."

The most entertaining thing about it was the guy playing the trumpet at the top of the tower. There was a huge crowd gathered around it on quite a narrow lane so it made it difficult to navigate through that part of the square. Another let down would be the horse and carriages. The square seemed to be the point where the carriages were picked up from as a result there was a terrible smell of horse urine, aswell as puddles on the groud, which took from the visit to the square.The square itself is beautiful but I would reccomend visiting it early in the morning when there aren't so many people or horses about :D !"

Robert Tolbert of Michigan (March 24, 2010) says he expected a square a mile wide and he mentioned a \"small statue\" in the middle. Ach jo! I must take up my pen (keyboard)!The square was a medieval marketplace, originating in the late 12th century. They built things human-sized in those days. The statue is huge, at least by Prague standards, and dominates the square. It depicts the Catholic priest and reformer Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake for heresy in 1415. The monument itself is from the early 20th century when Prague was still part of the Hapsburg Empire. The Catholic Hapsburgs were the folks responsible for the ruthless Counter Reformation begun in 1621. The statue was a rallying place under Communism. His words, \"The truth shall prevail,\" resonated with people! Each building has a fascinating story of its own. Many have \"basements\" that were once the ground floor, before the level of the Old Town was raised in response to frequent flooding. This \"fairy tale\" square is packed with history.TIP: To avoid tourist mobs, go at dawn or in mid-January!! But, please, not all of you!!!"

However, for us, since it was only one time, we really did not mind the over-priced food, or the feeling of hustle and bustle as the clock chimed, because the whole scene was so magical and we felt incredibly fortunate to be able to sit and enjoy it. Yes, the food was indifferent, and the service, after they have hooked you in, pretty indifferent, but you're paying for the view and the experience, and we really didn't mind. Our kids had ice-creams and so they were happy, and we felt like we were in paradise. We also took one of the horse-drawn carriages that depart from the square.

Large open-air concerts (FREE!) are often held in the square, and for excellent meals, just go up one of the side streets radiating from the square,where the price for a great meal is a fraction of the price of similar cuisine in the square.For cocktails with stupendous views over Prague, go up to the roof terrace on top of the hotel 'U Prince' which is just on the left if you are facing the clock. Enter the hotel via doors beside their outside tables, and go through to the back of the lobby and take the elevator to the top floor.....fabulous!!!!"

            "review": "The Number 1 Tourist Attraction in Prague. We stayed at a hotel on Starometske Namesti for our honeymoon, which was my 1st trip to Prague and my hubby's 3rd. I was blown over by the beauty of the square. We had amazing views from the hotel room.The square is large and there is always something going on. We saw a wedding and a Hare Kristna festival going on during our stay. It is a hub of tourists, and it very busy, so be aware that you will not get fantastic photos on the hour (which is when the astronomical clock does its thing). Make sure that you try to get to the clock before the hour as it does all the moving stuff before it chimes. The places on this square are very expensive to eat and drink and if you go off the beaten track prices can almost halve!There are gorgeous little winding side streets surrounding this square, which are full of tourist and amber shops and pubs and restaurants. It is worth going down the side streets as they really feel like you have walked into another world.This part of Prague was definately my favorite part. It was very gothic and romantic, and at night when all the buildings were lit up, really warmed your heart.i would say that if you visit Prague, you MUST visit at least once. Beautiful."

            "review": "Times Square of Prague. Can be a little hectic and a little crazy, since Prague tends to attract a lot of college kids who love to suck down too many Pilsners, but it's a gorgeous area for sightseeing, even if the famous Astronomical Clock ultimately disappoints expectations (watch your wallet when you're standing there watching for the hourly display -- many pickpockets I've been told). I really enjoyed just getting a sandwich from one of the many vendors in the square, grabbing a park bench, and watching the crowds go by. You don't have to spend a lot of money to enjoy the delights of the scenery and get a flavor of Prague."

            "review": "The Very Essence of Prague. Our trip to Prague was brimming \"absolutely to the top\" with wonderful memories, it is hard to pinpoint just one area of the city that I would consider the \"Number One Attraction\". Could it have been Prague Castle (Prazsky hrad) where we were able to take some amazing photos of the Cathedral, or the Castle District (Hradcany), where we noticed many locations recognized from various tv commercials and music videos? Was it New Town (Nove Mesto), Old Town (Stare Mesto) or the Lesser Quarter (Mala Strana) ? Or was it the famous and historical Nerudova (Royal Way or Kings Road) Street, where all the charming ancient burgher houses are distinguished with house signs above their main doors, and you could view all of \"Golden\" Prague and its hundred of Gothic Church spires scattered across the amazing vista? Perhaps it was Charles Bridge (Karluv Most), one of the towers-> Powder Tower (Prasna brana) or Old Town Bridge Tower... or maybe it was one of the parks where we enjoyed a picnic-> the cemetary of the Vysehrad Castle overlooking the Vltava or Kampa Park -> right at the bank of the Vltava? In truth, I would have to say that Old Town Square (Staromestske namesti), best \"captured\" the very \"essence\" of Prague. From this majestic and massive location, you can venture out into the rest of Prague, using it as your \"compass\" for all the other various attractions mentioned. It is the very heart of the city, if I'm not mistaken, all the underground subway lines converge to this area, making it the \"hub\" of Prague. You can meander through the intricate \"old world\" alleyways & explore all the various nooks, crannys, caf\u00e9s & shops. Or you can wander over into the other historical areas of Prague to discover each of their hidden treasures & secrets.If you only have the chance to visit \"just one\" city in Europe... then visit Prague! You feel as though you are stepping \"back in time\", in a different era, experiencing the \"old world\" in a time warp. It is a jewel not to be missed!"

As soon as you step onto the cobblestone streets of Old Town and arrive at the Old Town square, it literally feels like you've just travelled back in time hundreds of years to a completely different era. The cobblestone streets, narrow alleyways, gas-lit laterns, churches, building facades, colours, and their reddish-clay rooves will just blow you away. Going up the Old Town hall tower is a must to get a great perspective of the Old Town and Prague as a whole."

            "review": "Astronomical Clock is one of the best in the Worold.. The STAROMESTSKE NAMESTI (The Old Town Square in Historic Prague): People watching is fun and makes our trips and pictures interesting, especially at the Old Town Square where you\u2019ll see folks from every part of the World. Prices can be high at cafes and pubs along the square, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to have a sit and enjoy one or two beers or a latte\u2026and people watch! The Square is safe at all hours of the day and night, as well as the surrounding area which is full of pubs and restaurants.THE PRAGUE ORLOJ, also known as the Astronomical Clock: It has recently been proven the clock was constructed in the year 1410 by the clockmaker Mikulas of Kadan, and Jan Ondrejav, a professor of mathematics and astronomy at Prague Charles University. In 1490 a calendar dial was constructed and placed under the clock. Many legends have been told that make people think the clock was constructed by two different people in 1490. This clock, despite the legends and false information some tour guides provide, is still one of the best examples of Astronomical Clocks in the World. In the old days, astronomy was enough to keep the local folks interested, but in later years they added the animated characters to spice things up. This clock is not to be missed if you go to the Square.Recent History of the clock: The clock itself was severely damaged during the end of the Second World War. During heavy fighting in Prague, the Nazi\u2019s directed artillery fire at the Square and town hall (where the clock is). Numerous good folks made repairs in the late 1940's and we have the clock today to enjoy for many more years. I recommend doing some good research on the Internet for Prague and walking around WITHOUT a tour guide to see what interests you, otherwise you might end up in front of famous gift shops. Hope this helped. Happy travels!"

Everything was lit up and there were still people everywhere. The buildings are all so pretty and there were plenty of shops, cafe's, and ice cream places. Plan a stroll through here at night and you won't be dissapointed. There is also a little jazz club at the eastern part of the square which was playing music in the basement that wafted up to the street as you passed by. The memorial to Jan Huss was also beautiful, but seen better in the daytime.The best part was going up into the tower and the amazing view from up there, but that's for another review!"

            "review": "Beautiful square. The old town square in Prague features a number of interesting attractions and is worth a visit. Unfortunately, it is packed with tourists (just... like... you...) but if you don't go at peak times, it contains some wonderful sites. The square itself is quite attractive as the buildings all around it are a beautiful combination of architecture styles, from gothic, to baroque, to art noveau.The town hall and its astronomical clock is worth a look. You'll recognize it by the giant crowd in front of it. The clock is quite beautiful and surprisingly close to the ground, so you can really take in the details. It does a little animation every hour on the hour, but it's very short and not too interesting, so feel free to skip it. Behind the clock, across the square, is the Church of St. Nicholas. There is a nice fresco ceiling, chandelier, and some stained glass windows inside that are worth a quick stop. The monument to Jan Hus in the center of the square is worth a look if you know the history behind it (or read an abbreviated version in a tour book). The Tyn church (the large gothic church) is closely tied in with this history and also worth a look."

There's a large statue on one side of it and the Astrological Clock on the Town Hall building. I really liked the Chuch of Our Lady of Tyn, and thought it looked beautiful at night.We visited during the Christmas Market season, which meant that it was beautiful, lively, and full of vendors selling spiced wine, sausages, Czech ham, and tasty treats. I could see where the square would not be as impressive during the rest of the year, but I would still recommend at least one stroll through it to look at the buildings and churches."

Also check out the medieval courtyard at the opposite end of the square from the clock. There is little else to see here and not really any reason to spend time after seeing these sights. However, the shops and restaurants in this area are open late so this is an evening option. Get lost in the alleys leading away from the square. Take the short walk to Charles Bridge and the river and castle at night."

Just back from the market, not the greatest but the atmosphere was wonderful and worth the trip, The cobbles all around the area mean boots or trainers are the required footwear move away into the small winding side streets for the very best in food and beer prices.

Make sure that you explore all the streets around and find all the nooks and crannys - there are some fab bars and shops to be found away from the main tourist areas. Food and drink on the square is expensive, and you don't have to go far to find more authentic fare.Read up on the history of the square to really get the sense of how important it is to the people of prague.The astronomical clock is covered for renovation until October 2005 though!"
