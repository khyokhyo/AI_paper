There is an amazing vegetarian restaurant nicely landscaped below a waterfall which is a must must try if you like Chinese cusine. Nice place to get amazing pics at almost every corner of the garden. A must visit in hongkong."

An easy trip on the MTR to Diamond Hill and a short walk to the gates and you enter a quiet, peaceful beautiful garden despite being in the middle of a city with a freeway running past it. Make sure you get an Octopus card to travel on public transport in Hong Kong. It is so efficient and cheaper than paying cash too. There are several buildings in the gardens and a walkway into the Chi Lin Nunnery that is also worth visiting. There is a fantastic display showing how the nunnery and temples were built, one displaying beautiful pottery and a lovely tea house in the middle. We had lunch in the vegetarian restaurant behind a waterfall.. a recommended experience. We didn't book but we're lucky to get seated at a share table. Like everywhere in Hong Kong it pays to go early. The restaurant opened at 12 and we were there at 12.10 and it filled fast.By the time we came out the gardens were also much busier while we had them much to ourselves at 11 when we got there.A must do."

Looking at the size of the coach park this place could become unimaginably busy if you catch it at the wrong time.All of that said what a lovely place. The detailing of the Tang dynesty buildings is remarkable. There is an exhibition with model buildings showing the construction methods. My partner is an architect and was very excited. Also the large perfectly sculpted bonsai type trees are impressively kept, the rock garden is worth a look too and obviously the pagoda. We saw the tea building which seemed a little overpriced but I'm sure it was good at what it does. Nobody in there though.Gift shop filled with good pieces, if you want to spend good money you can. Little cage does drinks and very limited snacks. It seats about 20 max so if there's a crowd good luck!The temple itself is a place you just absorb and enjoy. Perfectly manicured water features and planting and the statues/displays are worth a few minutes of quiet reflection."

Once inside, traffic noise is cut off and you can experience the tranquil, manicured gardens of Nan Lian in relative peace. What is more amazing is it is free! If you are interested in garden design this is a must see - we went during the day but they are open until late and it appeared a lot of the trees are lit for night viewing. There is a cafe inside if you need refreshments, and an interesting gift shop."

We had several plans for the day but the gardens at the Chi Lin Nunnery were so fantastic that we scrapped our list of plans and spent the day there! To get to the nunnery we had to walk through the Nan Lian garden -- a large traditional Chinese garden that is managed by the nunnery. What a surprise! We didn\u2019t know there would be a garden and it was the most beautiful garden either one of us had ever seen. And we\u2019ve been to England and other places to see gardens. It was magical seeing it in the rain and with not many people around. The bonsaied pines and other bonsaied trees, the many beautiful and strategically placed large rocks and pieces of petrified wood, the ponds, bridges, water wheels and traditional-style buildings, the many different types of trees with interesting bark and foliage including banyans, plus a variety shrubs and ground covers made for a calm and peaceful day right in the middle of Hong Kong city!! The garden also had some beautiful exhibits in traditional styled buildings including a showing of Marino glass pieces, bonsaied small trees, petrified woods, and an exhibit on how the nunnery was made without nails. It also had a restaurant plus a teahouse where we had tea (with assistance in the traditional way) and a light snack. It was a highlight of our trip to Honk Kong \u2013 it was truly stunning. We think the best to enter the gardens is by taking the metro to Diamond Hill."

All the elements- hills and rocks, water, venerable trees and wooden structures- of a classical landscape garden are here worked together into a cohesive 8 acre garden. Each scene has its purpose and theme and works well. Although you can walk through in 30-40 minutes it is a place that invites you to linger and ponder, although the security forces will deter you from wandering off the designated paths! The adjacent Chi Lin nunnery is similarly peaceful and elegant in every respect. This is not a highly colorful garden with flowers though there are some but the shades of green, the flashes of colorful Koi in the water and the detailed wooden buildings will delight your eyes. The gold Perfection Pavillion tied to the garden by the Zi Wu bridges will draw your eyes and entice your camera almost making you forget the high rises and freeways just a short distance away."

The colour was taken up by Japan and they still keep the orange colour for their temples. The small museum on wooden structures was marvellous if you wonder how Chinese built the houses without nails! The vegetarian restaurant inside the garden is one the best I have ever tried. Lunch is around HK$120 to 140 per head. A must for vegetarian. After visiting the Garden, the temple is just opposite to it. It is built according to the Tang Dynasty style.

I enjoyed my lunch very much but glad that I booked.Slightly off the normal tourist trail but worth the effort."

There were very few people visiting when we were there - it was easy to find a quiet park bench and contemplate the view over the lotus pond. The Chi Linh Nunnery is right in the same area, so you can see both (but the nunnery closes at 4:30 PM). No admission charge to either the nunnery or the gardens.

However, these gardens are only across the road and there is a bridge linking the two; so we decided to take a detour to explore the nice looking park.The entrance facing Diamond Hill MTR station and shopping complex is odd, having had a motorway bypass constructed over it. That being said, it is the cleanest underside to a bypass I have ever seen, and once one enters the gate of the garden the sunlight will be shining down again. The timber museum is interesting; it mainly contains miniature timber reconstructions of famous old Chinese buildings from the mainland, including the imperial palace in Beijing. Little snippets of architectural information on the buildings can be found, including a huge fixation on hidden floors that are invisible to the outside - a quirk of traditional Chinese architecture.Outside again, there are numerous rare plant species mingling around the lake and fountains, and the trail provides a relaxing walk. The only part I didn't enjoy is that the golden pagoda island in the middle of the lake, despite having bridges over to it, was entirely closed off. They could also have signposted the nunnery better; one does not need to leave the gardens and cross the main road to access it, as we did, for there is a bridge connecting the two."

It is underwhelming compared to other botanical gardens around the world and is far from other attractions.Due to the high ratings for this attraction we made a point of seeking it out for a change of pace from the crowded city. Trouble is, it is so far away that you must spend a lot of energy to get there. It took us well over an hour to reach by bus from other central areas (Star Ferry terminal area and Kowloon station) through slow-moving traffic. (Google had estimated about 45 minutes for both metro and bus). So it was exhausting just getting there.We arrived around 2pm on a Saturday and found it hotter, slightly busier, and louder than we expected. There weren't a ton of people there but a lot were rushing to take photos and clogging up the entire walking path, making it seem more crowded than it was. At that time of day there was also minimal shade along the walkways (especially while navigating between people). It was surprisingly loud inside from the nearby roads and highways. So after a not-quite relaxing walk through the park we left to endure yet another hour-plus trek back.It is certainly a lovely park but nothing exceptional. If you're in the area stop by (it's free).

Too bad its in the middle of a city and not on the side. Recommended by my mom as well as other guides online, its a place to visit in HK.The buildings kind of kill the entire feeling of the place. Nan Lian Garden was built years later after the Chi Lin Nunnery was established. Free entry ! A mild escape from the \"city\" Upon entry of the garden, there is a huge wooden sign with the name of the garden in chinese. As you follow the pathway, theres a small building to the left which features many very intricate and detailed wooden structure models of larger/older buildings. Continuing along the path, you'll see a large golden structure surrounded by a pong. Very nice visual except for the modern high rises behind :( Its quite a nice walk (too bad it was a little hot that day and of course humid). The garden has a tea garden and a restaurant but very pricey. I heard its good to try the vegetarian meals there too but my friends were highly uninterested in that fact. You can check out the \"rock museum\" and gift shop that also showcases these high valued tea sets that my friends and I can't but wonder why they are so expensive. Lol The garden is connected to the Chi Lin Nunnery which has an extensive temple area which i will review individually from this. Great place to check out on a day of temples. Close to the popular and widely known Wong Tai Sin Temple (few stops away)"

This Zen Garden is situated at Diamond Hill in Kowloon, HK and can be accessed easily by MTR's Green Line. Upon alighting the MTR ask staff to point you to the exit gate for Chi Lin Nunnery or Nan Lian Garden. From the exit which comes out of a shopping arcade, just turn left and head up a slight incline and there you will see sign post pointing to Nan Lian Garden just across the street. Entrance is free and the guide post hands out a pamplet of the garden which is shaped in a half moon. The garden is beautifully landscaped in the Tang style and there is a building gallery depicting the Tang architecture where joints are not nailed but interesting interlocked. A quarter of a way there are steps leading to the adjacent Chi Lin Nunnery - a buddhist monastery. There are temples of Buddha's for Buddhist devotees. Along the corridor are displayed beautiful stone sculptures with Buddhist quotes for life! The central focal point is a lotus pond with beautiful lotus flowers around it. Back to the Garden: There is a running stream - the water from a nearby fountain that runs into two ponds in Nam LIan Garden where there are beautiful carps, a Pavilion with two bridges. There is a souvenir and snack shop and further down behind a cascade of water falls hides the Vegetarian Restaurant where simple vegetarian fare is served. Piped buddhist-styled chants can be heard softly as one meanders through the garden giving a surreal feeling of tranquility and serenity even though the weather was a bit hot when I visited at 11.30 am. I did not finish the tour and promised myself to return on another visit to go earlier before the sun gets too hot for my eczema skin. The garden opens from 9.30 am to 4.30 pm."

The garden is right across the street from the Diamond Hill MTR station. The garden is lovely with uniquely shaped trees/bushes, decorative ponds and waterfalls. It is next to a large nunnery/temple which is worth exploring. Its a place that you can spend either a few hours or an afternoon. There is currently an excellent Venetian glass exhibit on display in the garden. Also quite a unique nature-polished rock showcase and a modestly priced gift shop are on site. Watch for special performances that are also presented in the garden studio"

We went to the tea house - do not be put off by the price - it is expensive for a pot of tea but a wonderful experience. Again serenity is the key word - relax, take your time and enjoy sample the flavours. Highly recommend.

Probably the most exquisite formal Chinese garden visible in Hong Kong, this large park (3.5 ha) is was open in 2006 and became an instant hit with both local and tourists. The golden pavilion and vermilion bridge over a pond lack some patina but are very pleasant. A lot of care has been put in the overall design, the selection of rockery, trees are artfully clipped and many birds have adopted the place. A vegetarian restaurant is hidden behind a waterfall, a tea pavilion overlooks another pond, temporary exhibitions are organized in yet another pavilion (beautiful Murano glass vases last time I visited) and the boutique proposes interesting, mostly tea-related crafts. The hall dedicated to the nail-free joinery used in the frames of classical Chinese temples and pagodas is fascinating. A must see for any visitor to Hong Kong and a repeat destination for residents. It\u2019s free and less than 5 mn walk from the MTR Diamond Hill station."

It's located several minutes walk from Diamond Hill MRT Station. This is a must visit when you go to Hong Kong! Oh and don't forget to try the fresh orange juice at their Snack Shop.

Not well known among tourists because it is not on the to visit list of most tour agencies. But a good place for those who love nature and peace. The garden is well maintained and cleaned. There is a short walking trail which will guide you round the garden and end at the chi lin nunnery right opposite it, The architecture of the building, pagoda, bridges and waterfall has rich chinese and japanese culture in it. Quite enjoyable slow trail away from the hustle and bustle of hongkong. "

It is easy to get to from Diamond Hill MTR, just walk underneath the road overpass. There is plenty of space to wander around - lakes, paths, beautiful trees and rock formations to admire. They have a quaint little shop and tea room as well as the vegetarian restaurant behind the waterfall.Chi Lin Nunnery is also good to look at, just head over the steps on the north side of the garden, across the road and follow the path into the nunnery. Again, it is a very peaceful place to look around.Top tip! Food and drink is not allowed in the garden (I'm not sure about the nunnery). We took some snacks and carton drinks in for the children. We sat down in a few places and a 'guard' immediately came over and told us that we couldn't eat or drink. We even sat on a bench outside the park and someone came over! I guess they want to keep insects etc to a minimum!"

We went anyway since we were in the area.Both the oddly shaped rocks and trees are there, but so much more. A beautiful and pristine garden that must take an army of gardeners to maintain. There's also sublime pagodas, waterfalls and outlooks. It's a very peaceful oasis in the middle of busy Kowloon, and if I worked near there I know where I would be eating lunch every day. A bonus is the free exhibits on Chinese architecture with models of other temples, with special attention paid to the joinery on these old temples which is amazingly intricate given the era they were constructed. And the buildings hosting these exhibits were created in this style.There's also a couple of comfy cafe's and restaurants. If you're looking for a peaceful experience in the middle of HK, I recommend. And the attached Chi Lin nunnery is also an unmissable part of the experience."

This post is late because I went for an operation just after the return from the trip.The Gardens are easily accessible by the Hong Kong subway. We took the Kwun Tong line (from Mongkok) and alighted at the Diamond Hill station. We took the C2 exit and walked out of the Mall. Just turn right at the Uniqlo store and walk out into the street. The Gardens is just across the road but the access is through a traffic controlled junction. It is roughly a 5-minute walk.Entrance to the Gardens is free. Once you enter into the Garden premises you feel that you are being transported into a different world, peaceful, serene, and calm. There are the ubiquitous trees and plants typical of a Chinese garden, complete with pavilions and bridges. There are some galleries which are educational, examples being one that shows the timber architecture and construction of the temples, and another that houses rocks. We visited a cloisonne exhibition which happened to be on display.At the far end of the Gardens is a Chinese tea house built to replicate those common during the Song Dynasty. A beautiful pond is in front of it. There is also a mill replica nearby.We would recommend a visit during the cooler months as it will make a pleasant leisurely stroll. Give yourself about 2 hours for an unhurried visit."

Than - continue across the bridge to the Chi Lin Nunnery."

It's also a good experience to learn about Buddhism.The place is very accessible and is only a few minutes walk from Diamond Hill MTR station near Hollywood Plaza.This is the perfect getaway if you're looking for a place to escape from the city's bright lights and busy streets."

Visit the little gift shop for reasonably priced and high quality food and gift items. All profit made are used for the maintenance of the garden. My favourite place is the Gragon's Gate Mansion vegetarian restaurant behind the waterfall. The food is well prepared and cooked with no msg and reduced oil and salt. The complimentary Pu Er tea served in the restaurant is 15 years old and of good quality. Lunch starts at 12 and afternoon tea starts at 3:30 pm. There is set menu for both to choose from. The Tea Pavilion is a place to try some of the most exquisite teas. Walk around the pond in the middle of the garden. One one side is the carp pond. Some carps weight 30-40kg easily. In all, the place is a quiet escape from the hussel and bustle of Hong Kong."

The nunnery is not really open to the public, though the park does have a few pavilions with exhibits explaining its construction (built to Tang Dynasty specifications, without the use of nails). If visiting nearby Wong Tai Sin Temple too (less tranquil, very busy, but authentic in the sense it is used by locals for worship), then it could be nice to swing by the Nan Lian Gardens too. Keep in mind that this garden is managed by the temple, so relatively strict rules apply to protect the religious sanctity of the area. Beverages (particularly coffee & alcohol) are not allowed, and there are glaring eyes at your every move there! Mornings can be a nice time to visit as you'll catch locals practicing Tai Chi."

The gift shop is worth a visit, stocking a rich collection of porcelain, scarves, bags, organic snacks and souvenirs. My favourite is their chocolates which come in many interesting flavours and are better value than the pralines in fancy chocolatiers around town. One must not leave without visiting the Nunnery at the back of the garden. The temple reincarnates Tang Dynasty architecture, which is truly impressive.

But from the relative peace and informality of the nunnery, entering the garden and doing something such as touching or accidentally straying of track can lead to a stern rebuke by the rather overzealous jobsworthy security guards. I was even told off for putting my toddler onto my shoulders. I understand why they need to keep control of visitors but I found this overstepping their remit. There were certainly no signs saying I couldn't carry him on my shoulders. But all-in-all a nice visit with some beautiful foliage and stonework to look at."

It does not matter if you are planning a long stay in HK, or you are simply passing through and have half a day there - the Nan Lian garden is an absolute must-see, the most beautiful place in the whole HK. It is a stunningly wonderful chinese garden located in between skyscrapers - the contrast between the green scenery and the surrounding buildings is unique. The garden contains also several petrified trees, a mini-museum of architecture, bonsai trees and stone. And it joined by Cho Lin Nunnery (look it up), which is a beautiful temple with a collection of bonsai trees and lotus pond. And its all completely free.Believe me - it will be worth your while to visit it."

I had not heard about Nan Lian until I read all of the glowing reports on Trip Advisor,so made time for a visit and was very pleased that I made the effort. Although the gardens are a little way out of the centre of Kowlook, they are easy and cheap to reach via the MTR green line to Diamond Hill. They are well signed from the station and only a short walk.Although totally free, we were given an explanatory leaflet, with a map, when we arrived and followed the signed all the way round. The gardens were first opened to the public in 2006 and contain lots of well manicured trees interspersed with large rocks, in the style of the Tang Dynasty. There are five large wooden pavilions and pagodas and also an indoor rockery with ancient polished rocks. The cafe sells food at a very reasonable price and there is also a vegetarian restaurant (which we did not sample). Altogether a very well set out garden which gives a sense of tranquility and serenity in an otherwise hectic city.After touring the gardens, we went to the nearby Chi Lin Nunnery and the Walled City park - see separate reports."

Somehow, we missed having to pay an entrance fee, which we had read was $1 HKD. There is an illustrated pamphlet available showing where certain features and vistas are in the garden: waterfall, lookout, banyon tree grove, etc. No eating or drinking is allowed in the garden, itself. It seems there is a restaurant behind the big waterfall, but it was crowded, so we passed it by. When we were there (Dec. 2015), there was an exhibit of Murano, Italy, glass ($20 HKD for general public; $10 HKD for students and seniors). The woman in charge said we could take pictures, then popped in a few times while we were looking at the glass pieces to remind us to take pictures! It really was a special place.

Get down at Diamond Hill MTR and just follow the signage, it is just a 5 min walk. No words to describe the beauty of the place, you just have to feel it. Do visit the small wood museum near the entrance. Great photo opportunities for the camera buffs. The only minus is the exorbitant restaurants/ cafe and the curio shops. The visit to the adjacent Chi Lin Nunnery is a must.The garden is connected to the nunnery y a pathway and giant wooden doors, but check it's timings beforehand because the timings are different from that of the garden."

First, it's a 5-minute walk from the Diamond Hill MTR station and across the street from the elegant Chi Lin Nunnery, a spectacular complex on its own. Second, on its grounds are several buildings that house interesting attractions: one on the wood joinery used in constructing temples with scale models of such buildings as the Imperial Palace in Beijing and explanations of the meaning of architectural details, another is home to a very good vegetarian restaurant, a third is a tea house with expensive teas. Botanical fans will admire the variety of plants and the pruning art that shapes bougainvilleas into large bonsais. I almost forgot the cool gift shop."

Although the flora in November is limited, the rocks, trees and pathways were serenely beautiful. The Gift Shop is also worth a visit.The Google Map can be deceiving as it looks like a long walk but I easily found the entrance (under the highways). The map also makes Chi Lin Nunnery look far away but there is direct access from the garden. Head toward the Yellow Pagoda and go up the steps. At the top you will come to a walkway/bridge that takes you right into the nunnery...not to be missed!The Garden offers many spots for great photos of the ponds, the rocks, the waterfalls and (almost) secret pathways. There are also many great bonzai near the gift shop."

You can relax, read a book and enjoy the fantastic view of the garden. It is also attached to the Chi Lin Nunnery which is a Buddhist temple accessible via a bridge. The Nan Lian Garden right in front of you and the concrete jungle of Hong Kong in the background showed the astonishing contrast between nature and human civilisation. Don't miss out on this site.

It is surprisingly large, so much so that if you don't look up you'd think you were in the country, and you can even get temporarily lost. Despite the huge city surrounding the garden it is quiet, with the loudest noises usually being the cries of birds. There is enough greenery so that the air even smells fresher than the surrounding Hong Kong air, as if the bonsai-ed trees are filtering out the smoke and coal dust blowing in from mainland China. This is a formal Chinese garden, with wide, easily walkable paths; lots and LOTS of bonsai-ed trees, most of them nicely labeled; perhaps a few too many wonderful large rocks; several water features, including a huge pond with huge koi (try to catch feeding time in the middle of the day); a few walking bridges over the water, often closed to the public, however; several buildings including a museum of miniatures of some of the buildings that inspired the wonderful nunnery temple just a few minutes' walk away. Nice ground covers, but not many flowers -- the scale is just too large and the design generally not well suited to flowers. An excellent and reasonably priced vegetarian restaurant can be found in a corner of the garden. Be sure to read the whole menu as there are lots of interesting dishes in addition to the set menu."

At first a lot of the items we asked for off the menu they stated were sold out! A lot of beverages also were not available. I am not sure if they were holding back menu items for the next seating or if they had sold out the food from lunch earlier in the day. Even though we managed to order food we felt rushed the whole time, and got frustrated looks when we ordered more dishes. By the time we got out of dinner it was difficult to see the park in the manner to be appreciated. Next time I will make a point of going at lunch so that it is easier to see the surroundings. There is a gift shop which sells a nice variety of souvenirs and food items. The park is easily assessable from the subway, getting off at the Diamond Hill stop, and walking across the street."

Though it was a bit far from our hostel at TST, It was worth visiting.  For nature and garden lovers like me, you will definitely enjoy this place. The landscaping and bonsai trees are so impressive. You will be surrounded by green trees, still ponds, view of colorful koi fishes, chirping birds, running waterfalls etc. Simply beautiful nature! Plus, for some taste of their culture, you get to witness locals worship as you visit the Chi Lin Nunnery, a temple that houses their gods.Personally, we opted to spend time here after a day from theme parks to cool down and relax ourselves. I wanted our daughter not only to experience fun and thrill but also to enjoy nature, quietness and stillness of a place. One tip, visit this garden on a wednesday where its museum located inside is free. During our visit, we got to view murano vases - such exquisite works of art. Bring umbrellas or raincoat for rainy days. If you are in the mood of sipping a cup of tea in this beautiful ambiance, they have a vegetarian restaurant and tea cafe. Be prepared to spend however. Prices are terribly expensive. Anyway, cheaper reasonably priced food is always available at the food republic inside the mall, just a five minute walk away from the garden. Getting here was convenient. Get off from MTR diamond hill station. You will find yourself near a mall. Simply walk and cross the street to Nan Lian Garden entrance gate. Best of all, the entire garden is free for public."

Find a vegetarian restaurant hidden behind an artificial waterfall. And do make sure to visit the gift shop - not the usual Hong Kong souvenirs. Enjoy the carefully selected ornamental rocks.Exiting the garden, you go up steps to enter a stunning temple. Camera is a must!!!

If one has a few hours spare time, nearby an MTR station, wants to be wandering alone or with your companion without specific agenda, this place would suit the purpose perfectly. Get onto the MTR train and get off at Diamond Hill station, cross the street and you will be at the entrance of this wonderful Chinese Garden.Entrance is free and it will not be crowded during weekdays especially in the morning. The place is an example of excellent Chinese garden landscaping, and exquisite ancient Chinese wooded architecture if one is into these thighs. If not it is still one of the better garden-park with very nicely designed Chinese architecture and nice looking trees and rocks which together made for a beautiful garden landscape.It will take an hour or two to go around the place at a comfortable pace with some picture taking. Be reminded that tripods are not allowed to ensure smooth traffic and safety as I was told. More time is needed if one wants to study carefully every details of the beautiful garden. A small shop sells soft drinks, and there is a tea corner serving good Chinese tea but not always open for business. Overall setting is calm and peaceful where one can walking slowly while enjoying the scenery and admiring the architecture details etc.Worth a visit."

Told others on our trip to go, so they, too, visited and were impressed. There were a lot of very good quality penjing (Chinese bonsai), in wonderful traditional southern Chinese pots. The planted gardens were also impressive with a variety of trees and shrubs. It is a tranquil place with not too many visitors the day we were there, even though it was a Saturday. Allow plenty of time as you can walk through to the Chi Lin Nunnery, also with many penjing. There is a very nice caf\u00e9 to linger over dumplings and tea.

This garden is good for you who loves greenery. You will need sometime to sit down and enjoy the view, or else the whole garden is just one short stroll. For those of you who bring kids, make sure they were fed because you can't feed your kids inside this garden. And on the end of your stroll, if you see concrete stairs.. go up because it leads to the other garden (the chi lin nunnery). We missed that one."

There are plenty of trees in this walled garden and the pavillions, air-condiitoned exhibition hall and clean environment make this a nice place to visit even in hot summer days. The shop selling Chinese tea leaves and souvenirs do not offer inexpensive goods in general, and the umbrellas are probably the only exceptions.

So peaceful especially by contrast with HK generally.As well as the lake, manicured trees, bushes and precision positioned rocks you would expect of oriental gardens, there was a building containing 1:30 scale models of significant wooden architecture - mainly ancient temples - and another called a \"Rockery\" which is in fact just that, a display of rocks - not quite sculptures, but very attractive. Sounds dull but really wasnt. A nice little gift shop had some smaller rocks for sale but quite expensive!There was also a very exclusive looking tea house overlooking the lake, but unless we misread the price list it was very expensive and presumably only for real tea connoisseurs."

Very special and a tranquil place to visit especially if you are interested in topiaries and rock gardens. The garden is designed with the principles by a famous Tang Dynasty poet \"the design of the garden should suit the people who use it, taking into consideration the environment and to celebrate the beauty of nature.\" There are also ponds with many koi carps. The garden is part of the Chin Lin Nunnery and there is also a very nice vegetarian restaurant which is set behind a man-made waterfall. Very unusual setting but special. The menu is very simply but the dishes are delicious. Booking a table in advance is recommended as lunch finishes at 3 pm."

Not a huge place, an easy promenade to visit it entirely Although in the city, if you don't look behind the trees (high buildings) you can imagine yourself walking in some rural place. No need to be knowledgeable in chinese traditional architecture to appreciate the final effect of this place: it is peaceful, beautiful, relaxing. Birds shirping, sound of fountains, small bridges, typical pavilions and a large variety of banzai trees. I didn't try the tae house not the vegetarian restaurant. The souvenirs boutique worth a visit, I bought bookmarkers, beautifully done. A nice small gift, easy to transport. The nunnery is in the same place, just go upstairs behind the store. Being in this area, you can also take the MTR and go visit Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin temple (wong tai sin station exit B) for it's vibrant atmosphere where faith is noticeable."

We found the garden to be absolutely stunning and surprising as when you look around the garden is surrounded by tower blocks and is tranquility in the middle of a busy city. Highlights were the pavilion of absolute perfection sat in the middle of a lotus pond, the rockery, the mill plus waterwheel, waterfall and lakes. We spent a couple of hours wandering around the garden, which was not crowded or busy, discovering the gems as we walked around. We stopped for a drink in the cafe, which was good and the souvenir shop was also good. If you visit over lunchtime the restaurant looks good as the waterfall flows out onto the restaurant building and you get a good view of the waterwheel. A really pleasant way to spend a couple of hours on a sunny day."

OK Three times I visit Hong Kong and each time for longer.It is not possible to talk of Nan Lian Gardens without the symbiotic relationship of Nunnery to which it joins.It is free but please donate.I have waited to do this review because when I went in November the Pagoda was covered in plastic for renovation. Now in May 2015 all is clear to view.This was very first place i ever visited in Hong Kong as I was using the Discover Hong Tourist Board's Walks brochure.So I give a plug to HKTB online travel kit for heaps of e booklets and mobile apps.Because if you go to these gardens and adjacent nunnery at Diamond Hill MTR (come out you see it to left) then you have to go to next MTR to see one of best temples in Hong Kong which I think is called Wong Tai Sin.These three are three off the closest, highest quality, sites in Hong Kong so take many camera batteries.The Gardens are beautiful from every angle, immaculately cared for they show water worn stratified jasperoid rocks interspersed with manicured gardens, bonsai trees, well pruned full trees,water running and still, fish life,routes through the gardens pass by features and some pay exhibitions.The only drawback for me was not minding to pay for exhibitions, but no photos.Sad about that.Photos elsewhere in gardens are OKPlaces to eat cater to all from those seeking experience of a true tea house treatment, a snack place or vegetarian restaurant plus others.This is a place to bring people to impress and for tranquility.To propose, meet with loved ones, walk hand in hand - escape the bustle and close amicable business deals.I do not ever include pictures of places so as not to spoil the visit.But I do include pictures that may help make decisions like menus, maps etc.There are plenty of images on Google if you want to spoil your personal experience first hand.I just visited the Gardens etc yesterday and one special thing I must say is that if looking to buy quality value for money presents that I think the small to medium sized shop in these Gardens is best option in Hong Kong followed by Stanley Market.At low end fridge magnets are exquisite ceramic copies of ink paintings, pictures of great quality and in lacks of 5 for around HK$38 they represent ideal presents in size, weight, quality and usefulness.At the high end is jewelry,ceramic works,silks etcThe exhibit of woodwork and models of buildings once again is no photos but free and very special.To sum up this park it is all about perfection and dedication in care and that fastidious asian artisan nature to spend time to make enduring works of visual beauty.Look I love Hong Kong Park to bits but the difference between there and Nan Lian I think is that the former is meant to be highly charged places always changing to provide weekend variabilty to those with days off.HK Park is meant to be a charged atmosphere where as Nan Lian is at other end of scale and I think visiting both may be explained better by others in their own way.I get a buzz from both but I like seeing the interaction of people at HK Gardens.Children get more enjoyment at HK gardens that is for sure it is a total family experience."

It was not until I left the garden then I realised that the overhead bridge was actually the link between them. I had actually entered Chi Lin Nunnery on one side of the road, and came out from Nan Lian Garden on the other side of the road! LOL!The landscaping was simply beautiful and very well maintained. I would recommend spending an hour or so strolling around to wind down, if you have been doing too much shopping in downtown Hong Kong."

The route to the garden is well sign-posted and you don't need to book a tour to go there."

It is romantic, perfectly coiffed and very very neat and clean. People enjoying it's wonderful lure, but not crowded for such a great place. What I enjoyed the most were two things. The many pictures that I loved taking were so classic asian backgrounds and they turned out to be some of the most beautiful photos from the whole trip. The other thing, I was just fascinated by the fact that it was free! They have a very lovely gift shop where I found a simply perfect special piece of jewelry which I just loved. The garden is just a few steps away from a large shopping mall. If you are on a cruise, the shuttle lets you off at that mall, so if you get off there, don't miss a visit to this near perfection of a garden. The garden is not too large, where you get too tired, I thought it was just the right size, especially to take that break from other activities. Don't miss it and don't forget your camera. You will love it too!"

The monastery is attached to the garden so you can visit both at the same time. Be sure to go there early because part of the monastery closes at 4.30pm and after 5.30 you can only access the garden.

The gardens have become one of my favourite places in Hong Kong and I definitely recommend a visit to the gardens to future travellers. As others have said, they are very serene.Nevertheless, I was most fascinated by the \"architecture\" of the gardens. The trees have been perfectly sculptured and the rocks placed to create a long lasting images. Do not miss the incredible rocks from Dahua County and other regions of China. Words can not fully describe the beauty of this Garden. Perhaps, the best thing one can do for free in Hong Kong. There is also a great souvenir store with interesting artwork (handout paper, paintings, etc), tea cups, and rocks (yes rocks)."

However catch the MTR to Diamond Hill and you can be in a peaceful and beautiful oasis in minutes. The gardens were created in the early nineties, but the wonderful planting of so many aged trees with carefully arranged naturally sculpted rocks makes this one of the most beautiful gardens I have ever visited. Surprisingly the traffic noise is very subdued in this calm and tranquil place. It's a pity you have to share it with so many other people !!If you like gardens then don't leave Hong Kong without visiting this. For me possibly the premier attraction in Hong Kong."

Photo-ops abound with the juxtaposition of Japanese-style planting and buildings and the surrounding skyscrapers. An excellent gift shop and an outstanding vegetarian restaurant. Also a tea pavilion that we didn't manage to find (it could have been closed). There was also a display of interesting stones( really) to give a zen-like aspect to the visit.

Immediately the thick groves of trees blocked out the traffic sound. We also struggled to see many high rise buildings so we felt far away from inside a major city.It was a pleasant half hour walk passing by numerous rock formations and trees that looked like giant bonsais. Even the grass was carefully tended and looked like tufted thick ground cover.After passing by the rockeries we came upon the Lotus pond which in its centre had the Pavilion of Absolute Perfection. It was a brilliant yellow pagoda but alas it was closed off so we could not cross the bridges to it. Still it was a lovely spot. We continued on to the Lunar Reflection terrace which overlooked the blue pond which had huge fish in there. There was also an old mill and a pleasant waterfall feature, and a small museum devoted to timber architecture which had some wonderful scale models of pagodas and other structures.Overall a wonderful and calming experience away from the mayhem of Hong Kong."

You can easily walk around the park in 25-30 minutes, enjoy the quiet in the middle of Kowloon, the pond, the waterfall and the various small pavillions with permanent or temporary exhibits. There is a vegetarian restaurant in one corner of the Garden. The gift shop, also in the Garden, is recommended - it sells some very nice and tasteful local artefacts and souvenirs."

It was only by chance that we spotted the signposts for this place and we were so glad we did, as it was beautiful.Its free to enter and it is so tranquil and gorgeous.Its set in the centre of the roads (almost like a freeway) and you would have though on arrival that it was tiny. On entering though you realise how surprisingly large it is.It is so nice to see the high rise back drop against the green trees, and waterfall and lake.This is a place to go and relax, maybe have a bite to eat at one of the restaurants/cafes and enjoy the quietness.I especially loved all of the little stones/signs dotted round which provided lovely photo opportunities.Although this is so highly rated, we found the garden to be very quiet and not busy at all."

The gardens are really easy to find, if you catch the mtr it is located at diamond hill and is only a 2 minute walk from there. When we first got to the gardens it was just after 9 and it was so peaceful and a place I could spend all day relaxing, it seems that it's not huge tourist attraction so you get to experience them as you should.Walking around the gardens there's a chance to learn and see the beauty of it as they are extremely well maintained and also some labeled so you can see the different type of plants they use, also there are lovely waterfalls and a lake with coy carp in which you are not allowed to feed. All in all I love that you can find peace and tranquility in a big city !"

Time and money have been generously used in the process. Timber and stones were all carefully selected, sourced and built to reflect the actual style, skill and atmosphere of the ancient Tang Dynasty. It is therefore a unique piece of green in the heart of HK. The large lily pond is the higlight of the garden. The tea house next to it is in fact the best hideout in the garden where you can sample some famous style f tea from China while enjoying the serenity and tranquility of the surrounding Tang period setting.Go to Nam Lian Garden if you want to see a garden with a difference and a unique style here in HK. And, while you are there, don't miss the adjacent Chi Lin Nunnery. Actually, it is the nuns of Chi Lian who planned, built and managed the Nan Lian Garden."

The gardens are a beautiful oasis in the middle of a noisy suburb of Hong Kong. However, the tranquility was spoilt by the feeling of being watched all the time. \"Security\" guards were everywhere, even lurking behind trees from which they would emerge to follow you. I saw several occasions on which they admonished people for apparently breaking one of the many rules advertised at the entrance. As the guards spoke no English, their arm waving and agitated behaviour was clearly confusing to all those who were admonished. Even entering the park was off putting as you had to pass a large sign with a list of over twenty behaviours which were forbidden in the park. Some of these were reasonable, however others seemed very trivial and unnecessary. This over-regulation ruined any sense of atmosphere and tranquility. I did not find my visit relaxing. This place definitely is not child friendly."

You can definitely tell this place is not a historical site, only made to look like one. But it has the most bonsai trees and each tree in the park is sculpted to look like larger bonsai. It is extremely calm, given the hectic pace of surrounding Hong Kong. Kiddies loved it and the vegetarian cafe is extremely clean. There is also a vegetarian restaurant which sits underneath its own waterfall and a traditional tea serving segment, hidden inside of a large pagoda where you can sample the taste of ritualised tea service, overlooking koi carps and a large pond.Highly recommended. 8.5/10"

Despite it being set amongst major roads it is very peaceful. Visited the Cloisonn\u00e9 exhibition and a very reasonably priced snack at the teashop. There's also a restaurant. Beautiful traditional Chinese architecture on the buildings.The Chi Lin Nunnery is accessible via a bridge across the highway. Together the two provide a must see 1/2 day experience."

We first went inside Nan Lian Garden and took hundreds of photos because of its beautiful sceneries. The place depicts the vibe of having 'history being surrounded by the future'. The garden was built in Tang style, representing the enactment of the timber structure and garden of the ancient Tang Dynasty. My favorite spot there was the Pavilion of Absolute Perfection situated at the center of the Lotus Pond. It gives you the feel of pretty much being in the Tang Dynasty.There is a must-try restaurant there at the middle of the attraction, but it was said to be pricey but good.The place can be easily located from Diamond Hill Station Exit C2. It's real hot there though during summer or mid-autumn."

So for a short while taking in this fairly small oasis in such a hectic city is an enjoyable stroll. Especially the case if you enjoy the garden's structured beauty.

I lived in Hong Kong from Jan 2007 until August 2008 and despite this stunning garden having been first opened to the public in November 2006 up until my visit in December 2014 I had never even heard of it... I found it on Trip Advisor when looking for something new to see during a spare day I had during a business trip.Easy to reach from Exit C1 of the 'Diamond Hill' MTR Station (leave exit C1 then turn right and then left and you are there in a 2 minute walk, following the pink tourist information signs - See photos) this peaceful and stunning Chinese garden is well worth a visit. Just take a leisurely walk around, sit and reflect or go for something to eat in the Vegetarian Restaurant under the waterfall or take some traditional tea in the Song Cha Xie Tearoom there is every opportunity here to relax and unwind from the usual busy city bustle. The gardens are open daily from 7:00am until 9:00pm.There are also exhibits of traditional Tang building techniques in the Chinese Timber Architecture Gallery and a quality gift / souvenir shop to look around, and the Rockery is also interesting with it's artistic chunks of ancient rock formation. The Pavilion Bridge and the Zi-Wu Bridges are beautiful but sadly whilst I was there the Pavilion of Absolute Perfection was covered over for essential maintenance work (due open again in the New Year I believe).In summary this garden is certainly worth a visit as is the lovely Chi Lin Nunnery which connects to the garden in the North... And all Free of Charge entry for both attractions."

What I enjoyed was walking around soaking up the landscape and sunshine. It is obvious that a lot of care goes into the maintenance of the garden.What disappointed me was that many of the 'attractions' there are blocked like the Thatched Pavilion and Xiang Hai Xuan (an exhibition hall). Except for the hall, there was no reason stated so I am not sure if these were meant to be seen from afar only or there were special reasons. Also, at the moment the Pavilion of Absolute Perfection and the Lotus Pond is under renovation so that's another two less attractions to enjoy.From here, you can also make your way to the Chi Lin Nunnery which is a tourist attraction in its own right."

The garden is well maintained and it's kind of surprising that my family and I were not stung by mosquitoes - not even once! Despite enjoying the nice view and all, I was deeply disappointed at the vegetarian restaurant. 1. The waitress aggressively told us that if we wish to have our lunch, we must spend at least HK$100/pax. 2. When we were clarifying certain food, to make a more informed choice, the waitress was frustrated, and said, \"I don't care how your Singa-what-pore-whatever-China place prepare the food, this is HK\" We merely wanted to clarify, so that we can decide if we wish to try that particular dish or not.... we meant no harm, neither are we trying to compare which country prepare the food better. We have no idea why she has to be so aggressive and defensive."

The place is so peaceful and so relaxing that you will have no idea you are still in Hong Kong. The area was somewhat under construction a few weeks ago, but besides that, this place is worth the detour. There is also a restaurant hidden behind the waterfall which is very neat and totally different. I definitely enjoyed just wondering around and disconnecting from the hectic city life that Hong Kong as to offer. A definite must do while in Hong Kong!"

However, there is still plenty to enjoy, the Carp pond is particularly interesting. The gardens were commissioned in 2003 and completed in 2006. The design of the Garden is based on the Jiangshouju Garden of the Tang Dynasty, a traditional Chinese landscape garden in Shanxi Province, and as such look as if it's been there for centuries.

Like so many parks in and around Hong Kong the Lian Gardens is totally tranquil and the perfect place to spend a couple of hours. Situated opposite a large shopping mall and the Diamond Hill MTR station this is a great way to escape the city rush without having to journey very far away to do so. The Gardens are quiet comprehensive, so do not expect to be able to quickly whip around them. Take your time to enjoy the beauty and have a snack or a meal at one of the eateries located within. All food served is vegetarian possibly due to the garden also being situated within a Buddhist Nunnery. Wander through a Lotus Pool Garden, but take note that although photos are welcome around much of the garden there is no photography within the many alters and shrines that make up the temple.View large golden Buddha statues and take notice of the story attached to each. Look carefully and you may be rewarded with a close up of some of the naturals worlds small marvels as Dragonflies of different colours back around the Lotus Pool.Entry into the Gardens is free however there are two exhibition halls where special exhibits may have a small charge."

This garden, adjacent to the Chi Lin Nunnery, is a beautiful respite from the hustle and bustle of town, but is undergoing a lot of reconstruction. Try to time your visit for nice weather or a cooler time of the day as the garden can get very hot and humid. Unfortunately, when we visited, one of the best parts of the garden, the Pavilion of Absolute Perfection with its Golden Pagoda, was completely closed for refurbishment, including its ponds and bridges. Fortunately, there were a few interesting parts of the garden still open. There was a building devoted to an architectural display of the various techniques of elaborate wooden structure construction (not using nails), with models of existing Tang, Liao, and Jin dynasty structures. This was very interesting although it was difficult to see details since the room was quite dark and there was a lot of glare from the windows. There was also a special exhibition of cloissone art (extra charge) that was both fascinating and amazing. The art and various techniques of cloissone, using step-by-step demonstrations, were explained. It really made you appreciate the incredible detail and skill inherent in this ancient and breathtaking art form. In other sections of the garden, there is an curious display of unusual striated and glistening rocks gathered from all over China, and a serene waterfall sheltering a well-liked vegetarian restaurant. Located near Diamond Hill MTR, admission free, exhibit extra charge."

I thought this was weird and pointless as the whole garden is designed to relax in. Anyway, I had to 'move on' which I did, but thought that was really quite bizarre.

I visited the Nan Lian gardens 7 years ago and returned last week to find that it is still a serene and beautiful haven amidst the intensity of Hong Kong.The gardens are so peaceful and well tended, but the highlight is the vegetarian restaurant at the far end. We had the set menu for lunch which was delicious. Most items are based on different mushrooms. We returned later in the week for dinner ( booking highly recommended) and this experience was just as lovely and delicious! It is just a couple of minutes from Diamond Hill MTR and a terrific multi story shopping centre. Great combination for a day trip!"

It is quick walk from the MTR station and is on the opposite side of the road from the (must visit) Chi Lin Nunnery.The landscaping is in the style of the famous Tang dynasty. There are a couple of exhibition halls and souvenir shops (great respite from the hot July morning sun). There are bits of information on the trees and plants, and everything is landscaped and managed and kept absolutely meticulously. For us this was the best day out. It was truly, a green day for the mind, body and soul."

Beautifully kept gardens, lovely pond in the middle, some relaxing buildings dotted around the gardens.

This is a bit misleading since as far as I know the garden doesn't have \"opening hours\", while the nunnery does.In any case, the garden is wonderful, it's really what I expected a Chinese garden to look like. First of all, it isn't crowded like most places in Hong Kong or famous Chinese gardens in Mainland China. Second of all, it's small so it's possible to maintain it to the highest standards and with the greatest attention to detail.All of the objects in the garden are beautifully painted, you will not see many spots with peeling paint despite the constant extreme humidity and marine winds (containing salt) in Hong Kong. The bushes and trees are perfectly cut and this seems to be constantly maintained. Even the layout of the stones is anything but random.The place includes a lake, stone garden, waterfall and an exhibition that to be honest I didn't quite understand. Steam comes out of the ground in certain places to create a mist. The only downside was that the park doesn't have many places to sit, probably on purpose so people don't linger. This is unfortunate."

Chi Lin Nunnery closes at 4.30pm so plan well. If you like landscaped gardens, this would be a good place to take pictures. Note that the golden pagoda & the red bridge are out of bounds to all visitors. The security watches like a hawk too. Lots of beautiful lotuses in pots, huge bonsai plants & stone sculptures to admire. Miniature buildings of prominent places are featured too, although phototaking is not allowed.Move on to Chi Lin Nunnery which is attached. Devotees & visitors enjoy the peace & tranquillity that it offers. The chanting on the loudspeaker sets your mind at ease. The residential buildings towering overhead sends a reminder that this oasis of calm is right smack in the busy city. Good to visit."

Located near the Diamond Hill metro station, the garden is adjoins the Chi Lin Buddhist Nunnery. The garden is designed as a classical Tang period garden with trees and other garden elements that look like they have been there for 50 years or more. In reality, however, it is less than 10 years old. What struck me most was the contrast of the garden\u2019s mature plantings and exceptional structures against the \u2018borrowed\u2019 backdrop of high-rise buildings and wooded hills. For anyone with an interest in landscape gardening, Nan Lian is a must see. There is also a very nice gift shop in the garden.Be sure to also visit the adjoining nunnery. We were there in March and thus were not able to see the lotus pools in bloom. However, we certainly enjoyed the gorgeous layout of the site and the architecture of the buildings."

The landscaped garden of trees, flowers, plants and rocks are place in perfect position, almost to perfect in our world, but a great sight to see to make us reflect on its beauty.

Not many people talk about Nan Lian Garden when they reel off a list of highlights from the city state, yet I thought it was a nice little walk around amidst tranquil scenery, with the imposing backdrop of Hong Kong\u2019s concrete jungle looming large over the manicured foliage.Just adjacent to Diamond Hill MTR Station, Nan Lian Garden is a public park built in the style of the Tang Dynasty. Among its 3.5 hectares, there is also a vegetarian restaurant and a traditional Chinese teahouse.Wherever you look there are water features, rocks, wooden bridges over koi ponds, and incredibly well-manicured plants and shrubbery all around you. I thought Nan Lian Garden was very photogenic, and it was hard to believe that despite it looking as though it had been around for centuries, the gardens were only designed and opened to the public as recently as 2006.The golden pagoda at the centre of the gardens was very impressive. It was hard for me to get some good pictures of the pagoda as there always seemed to be other tourists in the way of my camera, so it took a little patience and some clever positioning to get the shots I wanted. In fact, later during my visit to Nan Lian Garden, a coachload of Chinese tourists turned up and completely obscured the view, so I was glad I had some quiet time to reflect before they arrived.When I was researching Nan Lian Garden I didn\u2019t really know there was a nunnery here too! It was a nice bonus and an unexpected surprise \u2013 although I didn\u2019t see any nuns!"

Clean garden with peaceful environment that will make you feel close to nature, full of greens, with koi, and water falls. The temple with red bridge was really an attractive view ti look at. Even our 5y.o niece appreciate this place. You will surely enjoy taking some photos and will admire the garden's landscape even the bonsai plants forgetting that you are still in HK. It is worth to visit , away from hustle & bustle of the city. The garden is for FREE. It's open from 7am to 9pm. Take MTR alight at Diamond Hill Station and go to EXIT C2 then you will see the sign to the garden entrance. Worth to visit."

We eat at the vegetarian restaurant in the Gardens having one of the dim sum specials on offer, window seats are keenly sought after as the large plate glass windows are continually washed by a waterfall cascading silently from above.

Dressing appropriately and making sure you take sunscreen and sunglasses is a must if you plan to go in the mornings during a sunny day. My advice would be to wait until the afternoon because the weather becomes a lot more pleasant then. Other than that, the garden itself is average. I expected to see a lot more flowers and koi ponds. It was a bit disappointing that access to the red bridge was restricted. Tips: (1) Get the brochure at the entrance. It has a map and some information about the history, architecture, and design of the garden. I learned things from the brochure that I probably would not have picked up just by observation. (2) If you plan to visit Chi Lin Vegetarian inside the garden for lunch, note that the wait for us on a Sunday was 40 minutes for a table on the ground floor. Even then, we did not have a view of the waterfall. You can manage to get a table on the first or second floor with minimal wait if the waterfall view is no big deal to you. Food at the restaurant was pretty average. They don't serve meat, animal products, or alcohol, but gluten was all over the place. (3) Photographing the statues in the nunnery is prohibited, but you can take as many pictures as you like of everything else. Also, some people actually worship there, so you need to be mindful of that."

The lake has huge koi fish, buildings are also traditional. Hope you can go when not crowded as I did as you get better photos and experience what peace can be found in the heart of a major city. Easy to find off Diamond Hill MTR stop, across street and you're there. Also allow half hour at least to see the Chi Lin Nunnery as they are attached by a bridge. Enjoy!"

But there are hardly any benches to sit, you must not sit in the grass and eating or driking is not allowed. So it's not really the place for a relaxed afternoon, as we had hoped.

It was only at around 7pm, it was dark and I was almost the only person left in the park. I haven't seen any guard at all and I think there were just a couple of people leaving at that time. All I can say is, it was incredible spooky and exciting. There were a lot of different sharp of rocks all over the park and maybe because it was dark, they looked like many different people's faces staring at you all the way. The trees also look scary as well. May be I would not like it so much if I had visited the park during day time or if there were more people. I'm glad that I visited the park when there were no ones at night.Tips: Try to go there alone in winter and arrived there 1/2 an hour before it closed.

You almost forget that you're right in the middle of this big, buzzing, urban metropolis. Nan Lian is an immaculate and charming garden very close to Diamond Hill metro station. There are several little exhibits within the garden, including bonsai trees and also a wooden-roof/joinery exhibit. The brilliantly eye catching golden lakehouse and the vibrant red bridge made for some colourful photos. It's also worth walking up the steps to visit the tranquil Buddhist temple. The only negative is that they seem to be a bit strict about consuming food or drink whilst walking around the garden, so I spent most of the time feeling terrified that I'd be told off by the wardens for taking a sip of water!!!"

The Nan Lian gardens are very lovely and have some features that were new to us, e.g., large bougainvillea plants shaped and tiered to form what look like giant bonsai trees. Ancient Chinese landscaping techniques have been used very skillfully in what is quite a new construction. This is definitely worth a visit and very easy to get to on the MTR. The one thing I would suggest is more benches so that visitors can sit and admire the various vistas."

We came across this lovely garden while visiting the nearby shopping mall at Diamond Hill - it is a five minute walk from the shops and the MTR. The 'garden' is a small botanical gardens in the Chinese style with everything trimmed to perfection. There are a number of pagoda type buildings that together with careful choice and positioning of plants and rocks create some beautiful views. There are also two restaurants including a vegetarian one with a window behind a waterfall! In addition there is an interesting architechtural display with models of pagodas as well as a souvenir shop. Overall we were very glad we made this dicovery, we followed it with a visit to the Chi Lin Nunnery which is also very worth a visit."

Interestingly, the entire garden and the nunnery sit in the middle of Kowloon and surrounded by 30-floor buildings and highways but I do not remember hearing any noise in the garden. It is also a very well equipped tourist attraction, there is a restaurant, a cafe bar and toilets. There are some exhibitions in there as well. It is very easy to access and there are more gates.

The garden was generally quiet and air was fresh despite many sources of potential noise just outside the garden, and I was impressed by how the workers maintained the garden, constantly fixing stuff here and there. The garden was filled with lush greenery and a golden pagoda in the middle complete with ancient Chinese architecture, and can I say how much larger it was than it seemed! Everything, from the architecture to the flora and fauna made Nan Lian Gardens a place perfect for a temporary respite from the hustle and bustle of modern HK city life. Music was played and added to the overall serenity of the garden. Just go ahead and appreciate its cultural significance and rich greenery. Nan Lian Gardens can be reached by alighting at Diamond Hill MTR, the exit signs will clearly show Nan Lian Gardens and its simply a stone's throw from the actual place. It was a real pity that I didn't have enough time to visit the adjacent Chi Lin Nunnery!"

I was very excited about sketching in the garden but was stopped by two official women and told you need a special permit to paint in the garden. I understand one may need a permit to set up an easel and paint but I think they should be able to tell the difference when one has only a small sketch book and a few pens.

Time required to cover Nan Lian Garden 90 mins without any breaks.If you want to still see nice collections of trees, flowers, ponds and precious stone then this is the right place for you. You can easily spend 2 hours with some relaxing time to get energy for any tourist spot of the day. It\u2019s a awesome place to feel the beauty of nature and take few nice pics from photography\u2019s point of view. Its not big park, not crowed and with full of natural beauty and pure air.Tips1. Just come out from MTR exit and then follow the arrow direction in the boards.2. Buy mobile sim card with data package (1 week unlimited data) which would help you to navigate the location in google at anytime. This you can buy right after the immigration counter of HK airport, at the time of arrival. 3. You can go comfortably with baby and stroller, no problem of staircases."

            "review": "nice place. It was a nice stroll through the park and the vegetarian restaurant was quite good. However, I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed by this place, perhaps over-hyped by other reviewers. It's not an especially big park and the exhibits and environment, while it's quiet, doesn't really have much to offer than being what it is, a park. I did not find much historical or even cultural significance to the garden, and it's not really a place for family entertainment or fun. So put simply, it's a quiet place, a park, nothing more, nothing less. Great place to stop by if you're in the area or nice place to take a break from shopping at the nearby mall, but it's not even really big enough to sit and read or meditate in the park, so I would not make an effort to come here unless you just happen be in the neighborhood. Not a good place to visit in the summer as it is way too hot, but being an attraction that's completely free of charge, in Hong Kong, that is definitely a plus."

Beautifully maintained gardens, ponds, buildings, rockery \u2013 everything was exquisite. I don't know what people expect of a garden, it's a GARDEN, after all, not an amusement park.

One of guards was very polite and she given me some information about the place. Unfortunately, some of the paths are closed to the public. The restaurant looked interesting with waterfall in front of it. The restaurants and souvenirs' prices were a bit too pricey for my wallet. The place was just clean.

I am a resident of HK hence some of the touristic spots I have noticed for a while highlighted in Tripadvisor but never came around to visit them. One of those places is Nan Lian Garden. This weekend due to limited To Do options with family we decided to give it a try. Getting there was easier than expected. I need to mention I have 2 toddlers and we use scooters when we go out. When we came in the garden, first guard seeing us of course tell us no scooter, which made my young one have a fit as he loves his scooter. we pass this and go other 50m, another guard tells me I cant carry my children on my shoulders!!! Of course my kids started asking for snacks, and as you can imagine you are not allowed to eat inside the garden. All this time one of the guards was around us, not sure if we were looking like trouble or why. We went in and out in 15min top. About the garden itself now. If you ever visited gardens on mainland (which we did in Suzhou and Shanghai) this wont impress you that much, to be honest for us had a little bit of artificial feeling, everything was clean and did not look that natural, even if it was pleasant to the eyes. Huge koi fishes in the pound but also a lot of areas closed for public at least earlier in the morning. Now, as a final recommendation if you want a little of Chinese experience in a modern city like HK and you travel with kids that walk by themselves and don't need snacks you go and try it, other way think twice."

Unfortunately, my skills with buses have always been sketchy at best. I missed my stop, missed the next bus, and to make the long story short, I got lost for the better part of 2 hours. Through sheer determination and the help of GPS on my dying phone, I finally stumbled onto the bridge that joined the Nan Lian garden and Chi Lin nunnery. Imagine a tired, weary, semi-traumatized traveler stumbling onto the serene beauty of Nan Lian garden at 9AM and it felt like I had been saved and literally stumbled into paradise (sorry, but it really did feel that way at the time). It was worth getting lost for.This is one beautiful and large garden with beautiful rocks/boulders dotting the landscape here and there, various ponds filled with large healthy koi fish, large columned halls, and various exhibits. As it was just myself and a handful of tourists and locals that early morning, it felt like I was visiting a secret space at the time. Chinese music played throughout the garden from various speakers positioned discreetly behind rocks and trees.At 10AM, various exhibit rooms open to the public such as the Pottery exhibition (with fee), Chinese Timber Architecture Gallery (free, no pics allowed) which housed impressive miniatures of various Chinese temples, The Rockery (free, pics allowed) which exhibited several bonsai trees near its entrance and hosted several Dahua Yantan Coloured Scholar's rocks. There is also a gift shop, a cafeteria, and a restaurant for hungry guests.This is a beautiful relaxing space and I would recommend this spot to visitors of HK looking to reconnect with nature or those who would enjoy a beautiful traditional Chinese garden. Plan on spending at least 1-2 hours here -- this is one large garden, plus you shouldn't miss the Chi Lin nunnery right across the street.(P.S. Turns out the garden is right across the Diamond Hill MTR station too, so it wasn't really that hard to get to. It's just something with me and buses.)"

This garden is very easy to get to - a short subway ride to Diamond Hill. The Chi Lin Buddhist nunnery is connected and also well worth a visit to see the beautiful Buddhist temples. There is a restaurant in the gardens but we did not eat here. The garden and nunnery are free to visit and are very well maintained - highly recommended.Also, there were not too many visitors when we were there in early October while the rest of Hong Kong was very busy. We spent about 2 or 3 hours at the garden and nunnery."

There are little temples, a lot of bonsais, a small rock museum, etc. I highly recommend it to get out of the busy city and be in a relaxed place. Its also really easy to get there, you only take the MTR until diamond hill station and then you can walk to the place. There is also a mall crossing the street so we had lunch there before getting into the park."

The cultivation of the gardens and trees are quite impressive and will keep you grabbing for your camera every step of the way. The journey is a bit \"far\" out from the city center, but if you're a fan of great landscape, be sure to add Nan Lian to your list. Also, check out the impressive Chi Lin Nunnery opposite the gardens.Check out my blog for photos!http://www.vagabondingheights.com/2013/10/a-new-discovery-new-experience-hong.html"

We took lots of photos and relaxed in this tranquil setting ,we were practically the only ones there which made a nice change.While you are there just cross the street and have a look at the Chi Nunnery wonderfully maintained and just as peaceful with lotus ponds"

It can be easily accessed from the MTR or buses. Once you come out of the MTR or bus station you will see immediately in front of of you Plaza Hollywood which is busy shopping centre - lure yourself away from the shops and instead of going up the escalator to the plaza stay on street level and follow the directions which are clearly sign posted to Nan Lian Garden. You literally follow the path and cross the road and the gardens are in front of you.On entering the gardens you are greeted with the immaculately kept trees and rock formations which epitomise typical chinese horticulture. Follow the winding garden path and you will be greeted with several interesting features. You will come across a small exhibition of chinese timber architecture which shows amazing models of some of the famous temples around China which have all been made out of timber without using any nails. You will see a beautiful gold Pavillion with a red bridge leading to it which is the centre piece in a large Lotus Pond. There are many such buildings to see and then you will come across a waterfall. Look carefully and you will see that in fact behind this is a restaurant - Chi Lin Vegetarian restaurant which serves delicious food at reasonable prices.From the waterfalls, trees and rock formations you will then be led towards the Chi Lin Nunnery - a Buddhist Temple.This classic chinese garden is free to enter. It is very clean and well maintained. There are toilets available, a cafe and vegetarian restaurant should you get hungry. There is also a souvenir shop and plenty of places to sit and rest in the shade.Definitely worth a visit and ensure you take your time taking in the beauty of this serene garden."

Just walked to the street and follow the signs to get to the Nan Lian Garden which is a short 5 minutes walking distance. It is located just beside the Chi Lin Nunnery at Fung Tak Road. These are technically two different attractions but as they are connected many often treated as one enjoyable experience. The Garden is relatively new (built less than 10 yrs ago) and modeled after Chinese Tang Dynasty landscape design. Beside the garden there is the Timber Architecture Gallery, the Rockery and a Tang Gallery (souvenir shop where one can check out the various books on chinese culture, tea, poetry etc.) whereby visitors can gain much insight into related interest. The Nan Lian Garden has always been considered as the finest garden in HK. We find the garden both large and beautiful, and peaceful to walk around. A good stroll will explain how it has managed to harmonise good garden design with elegance and style. Beyond the garden one can also see the skyline of nearby housing estate in the background.We have been to HK many times but this is our first visit here. We really felt that it is a welcome respite from the hustle/bustle of crowds. Another good tip; Beside being just an overbridge away from Chin Lin Nunnery it is only a station away from the famous Wong Tai Sin Temple and 2 from Kowloon Walled City, both equally interesting to drop by\u2026"

While undoubtedly pretty, this place has a certain artificial feel I did not particularly enjoy.Nan Lian Park (and the \"Nunnery\" next to it) has been constructed recently. It is basically a reinterpretation of old Tang dinasty gardens and buildings (8th-10th century), some of them still in place in Shaanxi and elsewhere in China. So, beware, it's not a historic site.After being at the Wang Tai Sin Temple (a few blocks west), which had such a lively, authentic vibe, this place seemed dull and even kind of plastic. Many paths and all bridges were closed for visitors for no aparent reason. And there was some \"traditional\" music on speakers. (what for? obviously the administration did not feel the place \"peaceful\" enough) Also Nan Lian park is not friendly for children (and for anyone who enjoys sitting on the grass, picking flowers or walking dogs), since there are many rules for visitors... This increases the phony, unfriendly feel. The guard, while friendly, stared a lot too. Maybe she expected me to be feeding the fish or something...The bottom lines: skip it if you're going deep in Mainland China and visit the real historic stuff there. If you won't leave Hong Kong and want to see something more authentic (less quiet tho), walk a few blocks to Wang Tai Sin."

Went on a drizzly afternoon, so my husband and I got lunch and waited the weather out at the Plaza Hollywood mall across the street from the garden and nunnery. The landscaping is beautiful, as the many pictures show. It seems like there are barriers preventing people from going to many parts of the garden, keeping you on paths away from the architectural features. The garden is hidden behind tall walls (which are hidden on the inside quite well by the greenery), which serve to block the city noise almost entirely. An easy walk from a green line MTR station; there is a bus stop just outside the entrance as well, but we didn't use that method."

The Nan Lian Garden fulfilled both these requirements this time. It is easy to get to via 2 MTR lines and well signposted and I loved it! Walking the shaded paths, sitting in small pagodas or arbours, admiring the sculpted trees, carefully chosen significant rocks and ponds with goldfish creates a sense of tranqility not always found in HKG. Combined with the adjacent Nunnery (also gardens), it is easy to while away an hour or two. Don't plan to take a picnic though - no eating or drinking allowed (other than water) and definitely no brawling or Graduation photos ( according to the information brochure that features an amusing list of 'don'ts'."

The Nunnery is a short walk away from the Garden, so you can easily see both.If you get there while the \"Exhibition of Contemporary Chinese Embroidery Works of Suzhou\" is still on, it's worth the HK$20 to see it. It's in one of the buildings when you reach an area with tree and benches to the right as you loop through the garden. There are about 25 pieces there.

Easy walk along the garden paths (w/ few stairs) & is also connected (via bridge) to the Chi Lin Nunnery temple (which closes earlier @ 4pm than the garden @ 9pm). There is so much to see & learn about the plant life as well as the architecture (types of wood & build style using no nails) & rocks (large & small) used. Easily can spend 2 hours leisurely meandering the garden & buildings. There is a beautiful onsite Veg restaurant & tea house (both expensive) & gift shops. You can easily go to the PH mall for affordable refreshment. There are rules to be respectful (no commercial photography, feeding of fish, touching of plants/flowers, nor climbing rocks, etc).

Even after visiting some Japanese Gardens in Japan, glad that we came here as well. Interesting to see the subtle differences between a Japanese and Chinese garden. Both beautiful in their own right!Having the high rises being a backdrop to the temple and the garden was very cool! Great for taking pictures.

I have visited Hong Kong numerous times to visit family and friends over the years and I can't believe I haven't come across this before. I don't know how I have missed it given it ranks quite high on the list of places to visit! It's an amazing hidden treasure juxtaposed against the chaos and tall buildings. Is is located 5 minutes walk from the Diamond Hill MTR. I note from the other reviewer that they had difficulty finding this by taxi (it might be better known as the Chi Lin Nunnery which is connected to the grounds and who maintain the gardens). Directions - take exit C2 which comes up to the entrance of the Holliywood Plaza, turn left and follow outside of the mall and the road around, then cross the road. Enter via the Chi Lin Nunnery. It's spectacular and take the walkway and steps to the Nan Lian Gardens.The grounds are beautiful and serene. It's styled on the Tang dynasty style - with wonderful timber pavilions; buddhist pines; and a huge koi carp pond. The reason for the visit was to try the vegetarian restaurant there which is located under a waterfall feature - the food whilst isn't cheap for Hong Kong prices, is extremely good in quality and flavour. The restaurant stops serving lunch at 2.30pm; after that they offer afternoon tea. I recommend a window seat to take in the views and be warned that there are often long queues! If you have time visit the exhibitions - we saw the exhibition of the contemporary chinese embroidery works of Suzhou. There is an extra fee (free on Wednesdays) but the works are visually spectacular. Visit the Chi Lin Nunnery as you leave. They have four lotus ponds in the courtyard; beautiful wooden doorways and some wonderful buddhist statues in a temple area surrounded by people chanting buddhist mantras which has a lovely calming effect and adds to the atmosphere. Really worth a visit!"

Many taxi drivers didn't know and we were about to give up after flagging 10taxis who refused diamond hill citing they simply don't know. After one driver agreed he brought us to some apartment. I had the number of the garden and cabbie called him. It turned out to be right opposite Hollywood plaza. Please mention Hollywood plaza shopping mall to any cabbie to get there. The garden is also linked to chi Lin nunnery. But I reached about 6:30 pm and the orange bridge was closed. Many tiny bridges were closed. The link bridge to chi Lin nunnery was closed as well. So try to go earlier. Before 6:00pm that is. The one solace u get is the serenity of the well manicured garden and its surroundings. They have patrolling police troops who watch people's movement and what they touch. We can't walk on the grass. And u can't feed the koi fish nor can u touch the tree leaves. But u can snap as many pictures u want. There was a Vege shop under a man made waterfall. The minimum price for you to eat is HK120 per person. They will tell u this as you enter in. The food is very tasty and I can taste no msg. They use bean curd and mushroom in all their food. The tea tasted fresh and musty. Overall this shop has good food.With a memory of a beautiful garden and good food i will go here again should I visit HK."

So serene, that we found ourselves speaking in hushed tones in order to preserve the calm, quiet aura. Access this by taking the metro to the Diamond Hill stop. The garden is well marked, across the street. Note: It was quite humid and hot on the day that we visited. I was grateful that I brought a bottle of water and some tissues. There is a gift shop on the premises, as well as vegetarian restaurant (we did not try) and a buddhist temple. There is no photography at the temple. Exiting the garden, back towards the metro, is a small shopping mall. (In case you need refreshments afterwards.)"

Even I am a local residence, I don't understand how come there is a park which does not allow people sit on the benches, lean at the rails nor walk any way you like!!! During the time I visited it, visitors MUST walk in ONE way, not the other. Not to say turn around to revisit a corner of the park! This is totally absurd! My son was just 4 years old and so he had to step on the 'barrier' of a traditional door to the exhibition room, and he was immediately ordered by a guard to step down before his other foot stepped on it! Unless you want to see how absurb HK sometimes is, you don't have to visit this park because anyway it is not very 'original' Chinese tradition. It is only a place built within 10 years in HK out of nothing. NO tradition at all!"

I would like to thank those who wrote a review urging me to visit.I made time to visit this wonderful oasis even in the short time I was in Hong Kong (just 2 nights) and I was most definately not disappointed.The gardens and nunnery is well sign posted and easy to find. The MTR system makes it easy to get to from all around the city too. Get on the MTR Kwun Tong Line and get off at Diamond Hill Station (The Hollywood Plaza shopping centre) and follow the signs to the garden. It is about a 2 minute walk around the outside of the shopping centre and across a minor road. The gardens and Nunnery (another attraction in itself) are both free to enter and are excellent. The gardens were quiet and a pleasure to walk around, were very well maintained, tranquil, relaxing and are stunning to look at. The gardens and Nunnery are a great way to spend some time away from the hustle and bustle of the city and get back to nature, even if only for a brief moment in time.There is a small cafe to buy food and drink during the day and also a Vegetarian restaurant located in the gardens themselves (though this wasn't open during my visit).The Nunnery joins the gardens via a well designed walk way and is also worthy of a visit.I could quite easily visit the Nan Lian Garden time and time again on numerous trips to Hong Kong and would recommend it to any one thinking of going to Hong Kong."

The layout is inspired, and the buildings within the garden have been very well built in aesthetic terms. The whole combination between path, plants, water and buildings has been very well planned. The garden opened in 2006, so it is still quite new and well maintained.Crossing the bridge to the Nunnery gives you a real spiritual lift.

So, I will write about both together.It is remarkable, how the atmosphere changes dramatically after entering the garden. It is barely 5 mins walk from the MTR exit (get down at Diamond Hill). Very quiet place. On the day I visited, it was misty and drizzling. It added to the effect. There are places where we can sit/relax under trees (and meditate?). I would have liked to stay a bit and relax as opposed to 'sight-see' this place. Eating food is prohibited, for good reason. A short walk on an overbridge gets you to the Chi Lin Nunnery. Another nice place, if you like history and religion. Many religions originated in India. Ditto in case of Buddhism. The term buddha means 'enlightened one'. So, there are technically many Buddha's in history. The one we commonly use the term for is the one from India, specifically, Sakhyamuni Buddha. As with other temples in HK, this place is generous with visitors. Visitors have close access to most things. Can take photos in many places etc. To get the most out of the visit, I suggest reading a bit about the place and Buddhist history.While there is no fee to visit/enter, there seems to be occasional exhibitions that require a fee to see. Fair enough. I visited the \"Su Embroidary\" exhibition. Liked it. Suggested duration: 2 hours at least."

They will not allow food or drink while walking the park, except water.The Chin Lin Nunnery is located within the garden, there you can also see some bonsai trees.It is easy to get there, Diamond Hill MTR station (exit C2) and from there a short walk, 5 to 10 min. You will find signs pointing you in the right direction just outside of the MTR station."

It's best to go in the front entrance, directly opposite Diamond Hill Station, as there's an info booth with free guides/maps in English to help you make sense of what you're looking at.The main attraction here is the rather surreal luminous yellow Pavillion of Absolute Perfection and the zingy orange Zi-Wu Bridge, surrounded by a lotus laden moat. To our eyes it all looked very 'Wizard of Oz.' Even the trees framing this scene were crooked, which seemed appropriate. It's a very clean park, and there's a small museum exhibiting wooden replica's of beautiful architecture from previous dynasties. Well worth a wander in there.To sit and relax, or pause to plan the rest of your day, I recommend the Banyan tree section of the park. These trees are just amazing - I loved them.It's a really nice park, and combined with the Chi Lin Nunnery next door, I think that visiting these Diamond Hill beauties, offers balance, depth and context to any Hong Kong trip: a must."

I never cease to be amazed that on entering the garden from underneath the busy flyovers, you enter a haven of peace and tranquility such that one is oblivious to the tower blocks that surround the spot. It is the perfect place to stroll around for 2 to 3 hours and marvel at the many bonzai trees that must be hundreds of years old. There is not much shelter from the sun so if visiting between April and November remember to take a hat and sunscreen.Yes, nothing changes but I will be visiting again next year when I know I will find an oasis of calm and tranquility amidst the brouhaha of a very vibrant city."

However, most of these places are some distance away from the usual tourist sites. The Nan Lian Garden is one of those exceptions being a 5 minutes stroll from the Diamond Hill MTR. It is compact but a well designed and well tended traditional Chinese garden complete with bonsais, koi ponds, bridges, pagodas and stone sculptures. There is small exhibits, a small cafe and an interesting looking restaurant serving vegetarian food located inside a man made waterfall. When I was there, the cafe was sparsely attended. However, the restaurant was fully booked even though I arrived early prior to noon. It only opens at noon. So make sure you book if you wish to dine there.Diamond Hill MTR station is adjacent to a large shopping center with an air conditioned food court serving a wide variety of regional cuisine. Its a good alternative for meals or snacks if you cannot get into the Nan Ling Garden's restaurant."

The gardens are formally laid out, perfectly manicured and, to my view, a little sterile.

There was maintenance work going on so you should take the exit near the Rock Museum and walk across the road where you'll see the entrance to the Nunnery up the steps.The park was incredibly relaxing and beautiful."

Hongkong is very modern with high-rises and neon lights but this place is a little oasis in the centre of a busy city. Relatively new garden and still getting established but has become a very important tourist destination. I would have rated it a five star place but for the touristy environment. Not all the places in the garden are open to the visitors but there are enough to spend a couple of hours in. The lotus pond is gorgeous and so is the Blue pond with Koi fish..so beautifully landscaped with rocks and waterfalls.I like to eat at the vegetarian cafe- don't go for the set-menu but choose your own dishes. If not very hungry one can pick up a snack or a fresh juice from the snack shop or the Chinese tea-house.The garden is 7 minutes walk from the Diamond Hill Mtr..easy to reach as there are enough directions signs to the garden. One can even go to the Chi Lin Nunnery from here and spend half an hour there...again Tang style buildings..very calm and serene."

But it lacks direction and control in building it's own character and soul. They can take a lesson from the established gardens in Japan. It gave an impression of trying too hard and placing too many items in the limited space. Visitors can't access many features in the garden like the arched bridge, pagoda in the lake, some paths etc.A great garden should be more accessable for visitors. But don't take it as negatives, it is still worth your trouble to find time and effort to visit this garden. The vegetarian restaurant in the garden is actually very good but you just have to order your own dishes but not the set lunch menu. We pay over HK$300 for this excellent lunch for 2 persons, the set lunch menu is about HK$100 per person. Do try it and you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!"

A very short walk from the Diamond Hill MTR stop (less than 2 minutes walk), you walk into this magical urban oasis: surrounded by sky scrapers and highways, Nan Lian Garden is such a serene, beautiful place, it makes you forget you are in the middle of one of the most congested places on earth. This Buddhist garden is full of beautiful groomed trees, set next to amazing rocks, which seemed to have been carefully selected and brought in over the years. We visited only during the evening: the garden looks absolutely magical lit at night. I also recommend the Chi Lin Vegetarian restaurant there. It is very basic vegetarian Chinese food, but the service is excellent, and the prices are cheap. A well worth trip."

It was not a big park and if you are in a rush, you can complete the whole round in 15 minutes. But a place like this? You need to walk slowly.One memorable site in the garden is a gallery displaying different rock. You may ask what so special with rocks? There were rocks resembling certain objects or people, there were rocks with surface as if it was a painting. the Gallery even give each rocks a name so that you can understand why it is there.Other than the rock gallery, there is also a gallery displaying Banzai. However, I am not really into miniature trees and won't understand much of it.Overall, it is really great visiting this place, especially after a hectic rush to Hong Kong on the day before, it does allow you to let go of the stress."

Beautifully restored gardens are recreated in the Tang dynasty form. Even though we visited in swelteringly humid and hot mid-July, we found the stroll around the gardens pleasant and beautiful. Proximity across the street from the Chi Lin Nunnery is very convenient."

Maybe even the oft sought after computer wallpaper photo. There is music playing, which you would think would be cheesy, but it was actually kind of soothing. There is a veggie restaurant and it had nice views, although I did not eat there. Getting here is super easy and very well signed as soon as you step off the train at the Diamond Hill station. Free entrance as well. There is a huge mall here too, so that could always be a stop for some AC and bottled water after your stroll around the park (Starbuck's too!). I went during the week (Wednesday) and I only ran into three other people. Visit the Nunnery after (they are connected and the garden guides you around to end at the foot of the temple) for beautiful woodwork and some shade."

Luckily we enjoyed beautiful weather, so the pictures we took are really colorful and show the shiny golden surfaces very well.The whole place is free of charge, and it's amazing what you get for it. From as much as I understood, the little round golden temple in the middle of the little lake is based on Japanese architecture and is called the \"Temple of Perfection.\" When we went there, you couldn't get really close to the pavilion since it was barred of with a rope, but it still made for great pictures when you stood on the path in front of it. The other buildings are made of really dark wood, and since it is a special Tang Dynasty building style, there are absolutely no nails or screws used to fasten the planks to each other. It is like a special intertwining building style. You can take pictures from the outside of the buildings, but on the inside taking photos is not allowed.Make sure you bring a good camera though, especially when it's a sunny day. You will get amazing pictures that last for a lifetime as the place offers so many good photo spots. Just one word of advice: Eating is not allowed throughout the garden (I tried to slip a little pastille into my mouth and immediately there was a security guard beside me,) so try to save that up for the little lunch place there or after you get out of the garden premises.All in all I really loved the trip there, also visiting the Chi Lin Nunnery close by. Go there if you get a chance - it's free, is beautiful, and you can get a whole lot of new insights and great pictures!"

In the garden, I can see hills, rocks, waters, plants and some ancient looking buildings in the classical style of Tang Dynasty. It's all arranged in a really beautiful way. Some of the buildings are designed in a traditional Chinese way, where no nails were used and it's all fixed a special interlock system. Very clever.

So this past Sunday we decided to head over to Nan Lian Garden to have some vegetarian food at the restaurant located inside the garden on the northeastern corner. We booked that morning and were given a waterfall window seat. Just absolute gorgeous view as we sat behind a man-made waterfall. Although we were inside in air con comfort so could not hear the pounding of the falls on the black rocks at the bottom or the rush of waterover the edge, it was still a beautiful view. There are two seatings for lunch 11:30 and 1:15 on Sundays. We were in the second seating and the place was probably 85% full. They have two set menus for people so it is easy to order. We decided to go ala carte instead since there were so many different dishes to try. Too bad a handful of dishes on the menu were not available. The food was tasty but after awhile they all seem to have the same flavour. The four of us spent about $155 each - food was good not great. Service was quick and prompt. Seating was beautiful.After luch the rains came down and we waiteduntil it subsided before venturing into the gardens. After the rains a thin fog enveloped the gardens, making for an unforgetable afternoon. Give the uncertain weather we did not venture across the street to visit the nunnery. Wished we had brought umbrellas as it is very peaceful in the rain. We will definitely come back."

You are not even allowed to eat or drink inside the park though there are several place to sit down. You can only eat at the canteen area. Worth a visit if only you hv an afternoon to kill and travel all the way to diamond hill and wanna see the nunnery as well. Or u can go here in the morning and go to sai Kung in the afternoon.

There are also some small galleries throughout the park which I did not enter because, while the entrance price was low, I was not interested in the items they were showing (ceramic vases and such). They also had a nice cafe that served only vegetarian/natural foods which was really nice to see. They also has some amazingly clean bathrooms :)"

You can walk the whole garden and nunnery in less than an hour -- the space is relatively small -- but you could also pass part of a day there just relaxing. There is quite a lovely traditional-style tea room too, where you exchange your shoes for slippers at the door, and where each table has an element to heat a kettle of water and a slotted porcelain tray with a drain underneath where you can pour out the hot water from heating your pot and cup. Having said that, this place is VERY touristy as gardens like this go. You are not free to just roam around anywhere or sit yourself on a rock by the water, as you can at other Asian gardens I've visited. There are barriers everywhere to keep you on a prescribed route and there are signs telling you to stay off various areas. Come to think of it, I don't recall seeing many, if any, benches to sit on either. There are a lot of security keeping an eye on things, and an awful lot of money-making features for a relatively small garden (to be fair, the garden itself is free). There's an art gallery, the aforementioned tea room, and a fairly large souvenir shop. I didn't see the vegetarian restaurant, but I gather that's tucked in there somewhere too.One other minor complaint: when I was there, the smell of sewage from the public bathrooms was actually wafting into the garden in places, which ruins the effect somewhat.I still give the garden four stars, because it's hard not to love a beautiful and serene Asian garden like this. However, I am from Vancouver, were I used to frequent Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Park and the Nitobe Garden. Both of those are more like \"working gardens,\" where you are welcome to lie on the grass or sit on a rock by the water and read a book or generally enjoy the surroundings as you would any other public park. The Nan Lian felt a bit \"look but don't touch\" for my liking."

If this is your first time visit of the city you should defiantly spare half a day to visit the nan-lian gardens.The colorful gardens are decorated with ancient chinese building style, a waterfall with a restaurant behind it and many unique trees, flowers and so on. There's a marked route which take you all around the garden.Getting to the gardens is easy, just take the subway and there's a 200 walk from the station.Also near the gardens there's the huge Hollywood mall you should drop by before or after seeing the gardens (even for a quick meal)."

But once you get inside, it is surprisingly quiet and tranquil, due to the specially constructed panels blocking the noise from traffic outside. Set up of this garden is Chinese/Japanese Zen style, all along the trail you hear light music of qin (Chinese ancient musical instrument) which really cleanses your mind. I was surprised to find that this elegantly designed and maintained garden is run by the government but not privately owned. It is free to the public. Inside there is a vegetarian restaurant which serves fine dim sum, good food but expensive. There is free guided tour in Chinese, English, maybe Japanese and booking is needed, they are volunteers so need to check for availability before going."

As you enter the garden you realise its a big park and would easily take about 2-3 hours to make the most of the garden. We followed the trail. It was interesting to see some miniature wooden replica's of famous Asian palaces, temples. The design and effect was excellent. We walked through various types of trees and plants and the attractions amazed the kids. They asked a lot of questions and I was glad they were learning. The other side of the park is the temple however it gets closed around 4 pm so we did not get a chance to visit to temple. There is no entry charges and the garden is well maintained. Its probably the biggest collection of bonsai plants / trees that I have seen. A must go."

            "review": "Unexpected tranquility amongst a busy road system. Firstly, the useful stuff (hopefully)...Getting there: take the MTR to Diamond Hill and exit C2. You exit at the shopping mall. Hang a left as you come out, cross the road on your right at the first pedestrian crossing (about 30m up the road), and you're there. The 5 minute from MTR to garden estimate includes the time it takes you to walk from the platform out of the station in my opinion. Try to go at a time when it's likely to be quiet. I went on a Monday at lunchtime, and it was relatively empty then. However, I can see that the tranquility of the place would be lost if it was full of lots of people. A couple of tour groups were arriving as I was leaving and already it was getting more noisy. The monastery is really part of the same site. To get there you just follow the sign up to the lotus garden and you're there. All in all, I was there for about 1.5 hours (garden and monastery), though I didn't stop for tea or anything. Do take a look at the gift shop too. It's not quite as full of the usual tat that other gift shops attached to tourist attractions are. Well worth a visit here even if just to escape the busy city for a short while. And the allegedly 'surly' staff that a few folk have mentioned aren't so bad if you just smile at them and say hi! They are not asking anything unreasonable of you to keep off the grass, not climb on anything etc. There are clearly a lot of people putting a lot of work into keeping this place lovely, so a little respect for that goes a long way (and don't forget that this place is free, so remember you're a visitor, not a 'customer' here). Just a word of warning to some of the ladies - the toilet facilities available here (near the exit) are the squatting kind. They are very clean, but if that puts you off, then there are other public toilets over by the shopping mall/MTR. There are lifts here for disabled guests, but not well signposted and I can't see how someone in a wheelchair would get over the steps up into the monastery/nunnery too, so worth checking beforehand."

I wish he would use more eloquent language, but you get the idea - the garden was really beautiful and it was a wonderful experience. Though he resisted going, he loved it. I am sorry that many of the paths were closed the day of our visit - but what we saw was really moving and spectacular. So great to see the juxtaposition of the tall buildings behind and the oasis within.The landscapes and the buildings were classic. There was an exhibit of wooden buildings and the joinery used to assemble the buildings. Really impressive, even for the layman.There was also a temporary exhibit of watercolors by a woman who has spent a lot of time in some Buddha caves in the northwest of China - they are really impressive and beautiful. She has done some really exceptional work."

The garden itself is really accessible from MTR - it's just up the block and across the road. It was peaceful walking through the garden, though I recommend going in the cooler seasons (Oct-Mar) to avoid extreme heat. Right next to Nan Lian is the Chi Lin Nunnery, which is also worth seeing. There is a tea room inside if you get hungry or thirsty. Figure this trip will take you a half day, but definitely worth it!"

We try to visit both the Nan Lian Gardens and nearby Chi Lin Nunnery at least twice a year in order to escape the bustle of the city, relax and enjoy a couple of hours in the peaceful confines of these two beautiful attractions. Our last visit was this past weekend. It seems visits here never grow tiring. One can easily spend hours strolling, enjoying and taking pictures of the excellently maintained grounds and well manicured plants, shrubs, bonsai, trees, ponds and buildings. Exiting Diamond Hill MTR station, below the Plaza Hollywood shopping mall, you are three minutes walk from the most beautiful spot in Hong Kong, the Nan Lian Garden (free entry).Within the Nan Lian grounds, the walking trail is just wonderful, calm and a feast for the eyes in regard to garden landscaping. There are two impressive ponds, first a shallow pond with a beautiful pagoda that is just serene when the sky conditions are favourable, allowing a blue background for your pictures. The other a large pond with a sizable deck for spectators to watch and admire the beautiful koy fish that swim these waters. There is also an interesting stone room with large boulders, polished by years of resting in riverbeds. Additionally, there is a very good bonzai garden area with some attractive specimen to view and photograph. Further, there is also a vegetarian restaurant, called Chi Lin Vegetarian that is very good, a kiosk that served fair priced dumplings and other veggie snacks and drinks as well as a souvenir shop as well as bathrooms located within the Nan Lian Garden facilities. Once you've had your fill of the Chi Lin Gardens, which usually takes us about 90-120 minutes, you can walk over a bridge and visit the equally impressive Chi Lin Monastery. Combined, these are two of our top temple & monastery experiences in Hong Kong and one of our very favourite places to visit in all of Hong Kong."

With some fabulous pickled mushrooms as a nibble plate could have eated a larger amout of those. Have look at the arial photography that is in the grounds as it gives an overview of how the gardens fit into the local landscape.

It is amazing to experience such a peaceful place surrounded by tall buildings. The gardens connect to Chi Lin Nunnery, making it super easy to visit both. There is no entry fee.There is a small gift shop and cafe, however, the reason I keep returning to Nan Lian Garden is to eat at the Chi Lin Vegetarian Restaurant! The food is AMAZING! The restaurant can get really busy during peak season, it may be worthwhile making a reservation. There's a minimum spend per head but it's nothing major, approx. HKD85 from memory. There are lunch and dinner sets or there is an a la carte menu. I have tried something different on each occasion and have loved every dish. I HIGHLY recommend the entire experience.For shoppers like myself that are scared of withdrawal symptoms.... there is a big shopping centre - Plaza Hollywood - right at the MTR exit - that you can visit on the way back to the MTR!

The gardens are lovely and there is plenty of different types of flora and fauna to see as well and rocks if that is your thing. I would avoid the restaurant as its quite exspensive. You should be able to see this and tye ajoining Chi Lin Nunnery in half a day."

A short walk from the tube. Small cafe and bigger restaurant (not tried). A lovely shop- expensive but some original things- as well as some smaller items at lower cost - quality in a city with so much rubbish on sale. Adjoins the nunneries with lovely lotus flower ponds. All free."

The gardens are not big but they are pretty (even if you cannot visit all areas) and it is not swamped with people. The tea house offers a wonderful tea experience (not cheap though - 150HK$ per person) but well worth it and serves a lovely vegetarian dim sum and sweet buns to go with it. "

It is an easy walk from the Diamond Hill metro station, on the way to Chi Lin Nunnery. It is beautifully landscaped with many of the trees and shrubs carefuly labelled and it is dotted with small museums and traditional buildings - a great place to spend an hour or two whether you're a gardener , a geology enthusiast or just looking for a respite from the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong. There is a gift shop , so shoppers do not go into complete withdrawal.... and when you get tired or thirsty, there is a nice tea shop."

            "review": "HK Hidden Gem, fantastic garden linked to Chi Lin Nunnery. The Nan Lian Garden is a wonderful, free attraction in the Diamond Hill area. This is actually the first of the two attractions that you visit after exiting the Diamond Hill MTR under Hollywood Plaza shopping mall. Combined with Chi Lin Nunnery, the Nan Lian Garden is our second favorite temple/garden attraction in Hong Kong, just slightly less favored than the 10,000 buddha monastery in Sha Tin. The gardens are immaculately maintained and look like something out of an old Japanese or Chinese storybook. We visit several times a year just to sit and enjoy the garden area. It is such a treasure to be had in the chaotic bustle of every day Hong Kong. There is a nice pond with a small temple surrounded by many bonzais that we particularly like. There is also a man-made waterfall with a vegetarian restaurant concealed behind it. The place becomes very picturesque when we have good air quality days. They sometimes have exhibitions at Nan Lian, they are usually cheap, HK$20 per person or so. We enjoyed the free River Stone exhibit the last time we were there. We enthusiastically recommend the Nan Lian Garden along with a further visit to the Chi Lin Nunnery just across the road, directly linked to the Nan Lian Garden. Combined they make a top 10 attraction in Hong Kong in our opinion. While you are in this area, you can visit the interesting Wong Tai Sin Temple just one MTR stop away (Wong Tai Sin MTR). It is a worthy stop if you enjoy temple visits as well."

It's very easy to get to, get the MTR to Diamond Hill and the signage is very good from there. It's free to enter both the nunnery and gardens. It's a peaceful, heavenly oasis in the middle of the city. I was really surprised to at how lovely it was (except for the brightly painted bridge - I won't spoil the surprise!)"

            "review": "Relaxing and spiritual. We had Nan Lian Garden on our itinerary from the start, we wanted our Hong Kong trip to have some cultural attractions , and this was selected from the start by my wife. The Garden is easy to get to, take the MTR to Diamond Hill, exit C2. very simple. The entrance isn't grand, it's actually quite modest, with a small sign starting it's Nan Lian Garden on the front. The garden is designed in a way that, you follow the path one way only. You pass many types of \"Hills\" we were looking forward to Fragrance Hill, but there was not flowers currently blooming, so there was no fragrance. which was okay, because the ambiounce of the park was more than sufficent without the flowers. We even observed some Monks visiting the park also, which was pretty cool.As we made our way though the park we ended up at the Nunnery also, where we observed a more spirital place. There were many Buddhas, but you are forbidden from taking photos of the Buddhas. It would be easy enough to sneak a photo if you felt like you had to, but we wanted to respect the spirituality of the nunnery. There are descriptions of the Buddhas if you are not aware of them, or the stories behind them. which we found interesting to read, and raced on, to finished reading the rest. This is a must see for anyone who want's culture, and a bit of chinese heritage in their visit. i'd also reccommend this to anyone looking for a relaxing, quiet place to go sight seeing. But, maybe leave the children at home.. this really isn't a child friendly place, unless they have either a love for nature, or are interested in buddism."

Had never seen the various kinds of trees, liitle lakes, falls and few places to eat as well. The best part was the models of temples and monastries. They were a real treat to the eye. ITs a pity they dont allow photography of these models :( Its a big place, so one must keep alomst 2 hours in hand to fully explore adn enjoy the place. Children would love it too !!!"

            "review": "Peaceful visit - worthwhile!. Visiting the Nan Lian Gardens goes hand in hand with visiting the Chi Lin Nunnery - they are at the same place pretty much. Both are free to enter and both offer peace and serenity which is a nice break from the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong.Getting there is easy thanks to the MTR. Take the MTR to Diamond Hill, use the C2 exit. At the top of the 2nd lot of esculators turn right, prior to entering the shopping centre. Nan Lian Garden is directly over the road but you have to walk up to the top of the road and use the pedestrian crossing to get to the entrance.You can spend half a day here if you wish. There is a cafe on site which has a limited but adequate menu and you cant eat outside the cafe so finish what would like to eat before you leave. It was a privilege to visit here, we very much enjoyed walking around here."

Although it was hot and humid it was worth the diversion to see this exquisite Garden.It is free and in some pavilions there is no photos allowed. However, it is a snappers dream for the rest of the gardens.It is a minimalist\u2019s layout, very typical of Asian gardens and there is such beauty in a simple rock with a green tree or fir surrounded by concentric circles imbedded delicately in the stones.There are miniature wood buildings in a pavilion (no photos allowed) of extensive well-known buildings from history. There is a pavilion devoted to large random shaped rocks (no touching but photos allowed) that have been polished to a mirror reflection and as simple as it looks, again the beauty is amazing.In the middle is a golden pagoda surrounded by water, greenery and striking red arched bridges. I took so many photos it was embarrassing. Lucky it is a digital camera.The whole walk can take about 30-45 mins at a leisurely pace. There is a vegetarian restaurant on site overlooking the area as well as a souvenir shop that has very reasonably priced things.I try to buy from these places as the money usually goes back into the attraction and I bought several small quality items to take back to family.You can also buy snacks and chocolates as well.This shop is attached to the Nunnery (another review).Take the MTR to Diamond hill, and before going up to the shopping mall turn right.I followed directions from a very helpful TA review and it was exactly right!Take the time if you love gardens and also see the Nunnery next door, it is so worth the trip."

I have the whole day to spend before checking in for my almost mid-night flight and decided to do more sightseeing and shopping. I saw a beautiful picture of the Nan Lian Garden inside the HK Visitors Guide. It's located within easy reach via MTR, Diamond Hill exit. It was mid-morning when I arrived and there were just a handful of people. I enjoyed a leisurely walk admiring an immaculate landscape, beautiful pagoda, rocks so unique but most of all, being in a calm and quiet environment. Next door is the Chi Lin Nunnery, a place for Buddhist worship, a large lotus garden, pond, buddhist temples and pagodas. Both are incredible places to unwind."
