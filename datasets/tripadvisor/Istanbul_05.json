Although the Sultan Ahmet mosque is better known and more frequently visited, the Suleymaniye easily competes with it for aesthetic beauty and peace. A wonderful place to visit and worship, or just spend a few hours in peaceful meditation, it provides a wonderful sanctuary away from the bustle of the city. Also not to be missed, perhaps as a special treat after cuma prayers if you are a Muslim, are the delicious kuru fasulye (baked beans) served just outside the gates by a series of shops that all specialise in the same simple but delicious dishes. Nothing tops off a visit to this inspiring mosque better than a filling meal of rice and beans accompanied by pickles and ayran."

One of the the best architect of the world Sinan's work. Stands on the 3rd hill of Istanbul (istanbul built on seven hills), mainly construction style and architectural style has been copied from Hagia Sophia. Diameter of the dome is 27 meters where it is 31.5 meters at hagia sophia. Sinans masterpiece is Selimiye Mosque which is in Edirne and the diameter of the dome there is 29 meters. So what ? Sinan, after 1000 years couldnt built bigger dome ? I am sure he could do it. But Sinan had a respect to masters so didnt even try built bigger...."

The mosque is actually part of a complex that includes madrasses, a caravanserai, soup kitchens, the tombs of sultan Mehmet and his wife Roxelana and Minar Siman. Although some of the outer buildings are being restored the mosque is a fascinating place to visit. The construction is classic and impressive. The interior is much more understated than the SultanAhmet Mosque, with pastel colours and limited use of tilework. I think the contributes to the tranquil atmosphere. The fabulous views across the Golden Horn are a bonus and on the street outside there is a row of eating houses selling traditional fesulye (haricot beans) and rice to sustain you before setting off to the next stop on your tour."

The construction work began in 1550 and the mosque was finished in 1557.This \"vast religious complex called the S\u00fcleymaniye...blended Islamic and Byzantine architectural elements. It combines tall, slender minarets with large domed buildings supported by half domes in the style of the Byzantine church Hagia Sophia (which the Ottomans converted into the mosque of Aya Sofya)\" (481 Traditions and Encounters: Brief Global History).The design of the S\u00fcleymaniye also plays on Suleyman's self-conscious representation of himself as a 'second Solomon.' It references the Dome of the Rock, which was built on the site of the Temple of Solomon, as well as Justinian's boast upon the completion of the Hagia Sophia: \"Solomon, I have surpassed thee!\"[1] The S\u00fcleymaniye, similar in magnificence to the preceding structures, asserts Suleyman's historical importance. The structure is nevertheless smaller in size than its older archetype,"

Just few steps away ( behind the mosque ..not on the main street ) you can notice old bulidings almost ruined, chickens, dirty childrens and dirty streets full of camomile. Something so odd to see. So enjoy in beautiful sourronding of Suleymaniye Mosque it is something beautiful to see. Just stay near main street and you will be surprised with beaity and welth of that part of the city."

It has four minarets with 10 serifes or balconies with stalactite corbels compared with the Blue mosque\u2019s six minarets with 16 serifes. Suleyman the Magnificient (b.1494-d.1566), also known as the \u201cKanuni\u201d or the lawgiver, was the longest reigning Ottoman sultan for 46 years (1520-1566). He was the fourth sultan to rule Istanbul and the tenth in the imperial line of Osman (Othman) giving the empire the Westernized name \u201cOttoman.\u201d The empire was at its pinnacle during his reign extending from eastern Europe, Middle East and north Africa with over 20 million people under his dominion. The Suleymaniye was constructed in 1558 by the master architect Minmar Sinan who built 131 mosques including the mosques for Suleyman\u2019s first son Shezad, his favorite daughter Mihrimah and his son-in-law and grand vizier (chief minister) Rustem Pasha who was married to Mihrimah. Behind the mosque are the mausoleums (turbes) of Sultan Suleyman, his wife Hurrem (Roxelana) and daughter Mihrimah and a four other sultans. Outside the mosque walls is the tomb of the architect, Sinan.The Blue mosque was built over a half century later in 1616 by master Sinan\u2019s apprentice Mehmed Aga.This is truly a very huge and beautiful mosque with large courtyards and terraces and being built on a hilltop it has some gorgeous views of the Goldern Horn and the Bosphorus strait. For this reason, it is also the most prominently visible mosque from the Golden Horn. It is very much less crowded than the Blue mosque and the experience is so much the better and more relaxed to soak in the atmosphere of this magnificent structure. For these two main reasons I personally preferred this one."

The architect was master designer Mimar Sinan and this wonderful mosque represents the Ottoman period at its greatest. The glorious dimensions of the mosque means that this huge building dominates the Golden Horn and wherever you are in Istanbul, you can see the building. The clever design incorporates foundations which include juniper piles and beams giving the building the elasticity required to absorb the shock waves of earthquakes without damage. It also has a ventilation system which prevents any accumulation of dirt and 255 pots built into the dome to enhance the acoustics. All in the sixteenth century...fantastic!"

It's a great sight but you have to walk thru a fairly sketchy neighborhood to get there. We actually checked out the \"New Mosque\" and passed the spice bazaar to reach the Sulemaniye Mosque. It's a worth while beautiful place to visit with great sights and picture opportunities. We love all the architecture by Mimar Sinan and wanted to check this place out, all the mosques look fairly the same with unique charecteristics. You might want to use a reliable taxi cab to and from the mosque ( beware of the taxi cab drivers in Istanbul )."

Compared with the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, this mosque is both crisper architecturally (its near-white stone exudes lightness) and brighter in its feel. Many families were sitting around on the grass on the grounds enjoying the sunny afternoon and children romped at ease with their families in the courtyard. It was eye-opening to us as American Protestants to be able to feel so welcomed in this beautiful mosque. It had a more open door to visitors, obviously expecting in return the respect to religious customs that everyone showed, than some of the large cathedrals in Europe we have visited."

In reality there is no comparison between the two because they are so different with the exception of both being mosques.I felt very much at peace inside this mosque with its individual places designated by the carpet and the quiet simplicity of the decor.

The massive and beautiful impressive building is a fitting tribute to its patron Suleyman the magnificent. It is difficult to decide which of the 2 mosques is better between this and Blue mosque. Suleymaniye is definitely more peaceful owing to lack to tourists. We just reached there before sunset and then went inside to offer maghrib (after sunset) prayers. Immense calm, soaring space and serene atmosphere welcomes you when you are inside. Regretfully we couldn\u2019t spend much day time in the Suleymaniye masjid and didn\u2019t see its massive outer complex and other areas. Will definitely go again if I am back in Istanbul."

The grounds surrounding it are not a grand as the Blue Mosques, but still very inviting to spend some leisure time and absorb the moment and the view."

The views are stunning -- pictures barely show -- and the courtyard and the Mosque itself masterworks.

Especially drinking turkish coffee in any cafe near by and looking at that great view its something everyone should experience for themselves! When you walk inside mosque its just breathtaking, i could feel how i just stopped at entry and stare! Maybe cz tourist were less and morw people were for prayer there,but i got this incredible energy of this mosque i sat inside for while just to enjoy this energy! The architect of the mosque really made it magnificent as Sultan Sulemain was for ottomans! Even blue mosque was built by the student of the architect of sulemania! Its must see mosque in Istanbul! I took taxi and i didn't to walk all up way to mosque, but after i just walked down to spice baazar. So don't forget to wear comfy shoes"

Go walk around its huge compound where you can find tombs that belongs to Suleyman the maginificient (and other significant Ottomans too).

In addition to the mosque, the Suleymaniye complex includes a library, hospital and soup kitchens that fed thousands of the city's poor, regardless of their religion. (Ironically, the street between the mosque and the charitable buildings once held cafes that sold both opium and hashish, earning it the moniker \"Addict's Alley.\") The tombs of Suleyman, his wife Roxelana, his daughter Mihrimah and his two successors, Suleyman II and Ahmet II, are in the main mosque, but the tomb of Sinan himself is just outside the building's walls.

I have booked a hotel and had a whole day to enjoy the architecture of Istanbul. I started my trip with Aya Sophya and then I visited the Suleymaniye Mosque - Ottoman imperial mosque -the largest and grandest. It is an easy walk of less than 10 mins arond the University from Beyazit Square and the Grand Bazaar.It was built in 1550s. Suleymaniye complex looks over the Golden Horn, Bosporus and the Sea Marmara to Asia.Inside of Suleymaniye is simply breathtaking in its expanse.There is an entrance for tourists on the other side from the building. Before to enter you have to take out your shoes and cover a head with a scarf for women.The Mosque is open every day, for free. Just avoid a prayer hours.I am pretty sure you will enjoy it too."

Be sure to respect prayer time - arrive after it has ended or well before it starts (if you are aware of when the next time starts). As with most mosques in Istanbul, you will be asked to cover your head/shoulders with a scarf (if you are a woman) and possibly you legs if they are bare (men and women) and to remove your shoes, all before you can enter the mosque.

The real attraction, of course, is the mosque itself, which manages to enclose an enormous space without feeling at all cavernous. This is a must-see! The neighborhood nearby is a preservation district, and the adjoining hamam has been recently renovated and is open to the public.

There is something about this building, along with the forecourt and gardens that is absolutely charming, the complex exudes a tranquillity conducive to quiet contemplation; all in all seemingly miles away from the commercial areas close by. It is worthwhile strolling out onto the Terrace behind the Mosque to take in the wonderful view of the Golden Horn."

The magnificent dome is supported by 4 columns only, making it possible for sunlight to enter in from all directions, making it so divine and majestic.

Most of them are crowded with tourists at most times and most also are decorated reliefs and tile work. Sulemaniye isn't different. It doesn't have tiles or too much decorative work to show off. It's simple and has magnificent arches. In the absence of decorative arts, the architecture of this mosque assumes its rightful place and catches the observer's eye. The mosque majestic both from inside and out. We visited it early in the morning around 8, straight from the airport, so there were a few people around. We sat in doors and soaked ourselves in the ambiance for a while. You admire how arches almost speak to each other when they come and meet at various angle up top to form inside of the ceiling around the central dome. There's not much to distract your vision. We visited after visiting the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and a few other mosques but found Sulemaniye the best. Don't forget to go in the back for the excellent views of the bay and the city across, even Galata bridge. It's a must when in Istanbul and should perhaps be the last or the first thing you visit, so you can unwind and just let go of yourself in there, admiring the peaceful retreat that it is."

If you walk around the back there is a terrace area with incredible views of the city--great photo op. The interior is inspiring with its massive dome and supporting pillars. The colorful tilework adds to the beauty. If you are lucky there will be a service being conducted with wonderful music."

Unless you want to pay tribute, I'd skip Suliman's crypt. Be sure to get the 'dry beans' at the restaurant alongside the mosque.

Even the courtyard had a welcoming air to it. You can get a good view of the rest of Istanbul from the low wall facing east, and the adjacent graveyard, containing Sultan Suleiman I's mausoleum is worth seeing as well.The mosque was commissioned by Suleiman in 1550 and is a fine example of an early Ottoman Mosque. It has been restored three times due to fire and earthquake. As the Mosque is on a high hill, it doesn't have as many visitors as the Blue Mosque, so if serenity and peace is what you're looking for, I'd recommend this one as a pleasant alternative."

It is located up a hill next to the Istanbul University. We were a bit lost navigating the streets but a nice young university student volunteered to help and walked us most of the way there - Turkish people are very kind and hospitable. The mosque is quite grand as you walk up to it. It is strategically located so the views overlook the Bosphorus Strait and out towards the New District. It is most impressive to walk in from the northside, through the courtyard. It is free to visit but avoid 30 minutes prior to the Muslim call to prayer & during prayer, as well as Friday afternoons (Muslim holy day). Both women and men should cover their shoulders and knees. Women need to cover their heads as well. Scarves and clothing are provided to borrow as you enter the mosque if you come unprepared. Everyone must remove their shoes before entering. The mosque is magnificent and recently restored. It rivals the Blue Mosque in its grandeur and seems more open and airy too. You are allowed to take pictures. Just understand the etiquette and not interfere with those who are there to pray. There were volunteers working when we were there to hand out pamphlets about Islam or to answer any questions about the mosque. I found the pamphlets very informative.There are wonderful photo opportunities outside the mosque overlooking the Bosphorus Strait. There is a cemetery located behind the mosque worth seeing as well. Featured inside are the tombs of Suleyman the Magnificent and his wife, Roxelana."

Said to be 'better' than the Blue Mosque, both by the master architect Mimar Sinan in the 16th century (his tomb is nearby), though I would find it difficult to decide. They both have that huge, amazing open space under the large dome, seemingly almost floating yet the weight must be immense. The restored decoration's geometric design is, of course, beautifully done.This mosque benefits from its position, overlooking the Golden Horn and Bosphorus - good views from the outside - as well as having the (visitable) tombs of Suleiman the Magnificent and his wife 'Roxelana' in the cemetery at the side. It is also far quieter than the Blue Mosque, allowing a real appreciation of the building.The mosque is walkable from the Sultanahmet area, if a little far, but not far from the Grand Bazaar/ tram. There are a number of cafes and restaurants nearby (no alcohol near to mosques of course). Which leads to a small rant, like another reviewer: these are places of worship and there are rules about dressing modestly and acting respectfully. The authorities are very good about providing coverings (free) when they could easily just stop entry, but it's not difficult to dress correctly.... is it? No, I'm not a Muslim.It's also worth checking prayer times too, especially on Friday, to ensure it's not closed to visitors.It's free to enter, but a donation would be appreciated."

It did not have the large crowds, though I'm sure it was timing on my part. It was bright and comforting and welcoming. I went here twice just to sit. Some of the ferile cats of Istanbul claim this space as their own and they are quite lovely. I recommend it. The mosque is closed to the public during prayer time."

Note closing/prayer schedule carefully, as they understandably are pretty forceful and abrupt in terms of clearing people out...since it takes a while. You'll be given a plastic bag for your shoes. It will be mobbed, but I found I could find a quiet area and just enjoy staring at the tile work, dome and architecture. I had a guide, and so enjoyed 30 minutes of history, etc. But then found I wanted quiet time by myself...at least another 30-60 minutes...to just wander around, stare, and enjoy the amazing space. Don't rush through the courtyard and exit area, as that arcade is quite lovely. Let's face it, you aren't deciding whether to go based on a trip advisor review...of course you are going. I guess all I can tell you for here and Hagia Sofia is that you should not rush. Plan at least an hour or up to 2, and just take your time soaking it in."

A must visit to marvel at Sinan's architecture (1550s), to learn about the history of the mosque during the reign of Suleyman - besides being a place of worship, the mosque provided food for over a 1,000 needy residents (Muslims, Jews and Christians) of Istanbul every day and to have a tranquil moment or two away from the hustle and bustle of Istanbul. The mosque is unique - exquisite tile work, stained glass windows and the breathtaking dome and absolute tranquillity all leave one speechless......The views of the Golden Horn from the restful gardens are worth admiring too.A few tips:1) We took the tram to Beyazit (in the Grand Bazaar area) and approached the mosque via the University. The climb to the top is not steep. On arriving at the station, cross over towards the Grand Bazaar. You will see a line of cafes. Keep to the left and then climb the steps which lead to a kind of square in front of the University gates - through the gates, into the campus (pleasant park like space) and follow the path to the Sulemaniye mosque. You will enter the mosque where the cemetry is (worth a look). Between the campus and the mosque there are interesting university buildings.2) On the way back we went down the hill and then braved a visit of the Grand Bazaar!3) Bathroom facilities are state of the art - modern and very clean.4) This mosque is less crowded than the Blue Mosque. Staff are very helpful and polite and plastic bags are provided for shoes.5) Make sure to enjoy the views of the Golden Horn and to walk around the complex.6) There is a lovely cafe (with outdoor seating) in front of the mosque."

The Suleymaniye Mosque is comparable if not larger than the Sultanahmet(Blue) Mosque or the Hagia Sophia and in immaculate condition. The only drawback is that it is not situated adjacent to the major tourist centers. This also means that it is not crowded with visitors and allows you to contemplate the building and its gardens.This mosque is on the brow of the hill overlooking the Golden Horn and the Galata Bridge. It is about a 10 minute walk downhill from the western edge of the Grand Bazaar. Its dome and 6 minarets are a prominent site on the skyline when viewed from the harbor.The style is understated to Western eyes with subtle stone colors and a lack of pictorial art. This is in keeping with the Prophet's injunction against human representation in order to bolster Islam's inclusiveness to all. The effect of the building is none the less powerful and beautiful. It is set in a lovely garden with a view of the harbor. The garden also contains a small cemetery with interesting toms. The entire complex was constructed 5-600 years ago as a mosque, school, and social center. The mosque is open to all visitors except during services. it is well worth a visit to see the beautiful architecture and the view."

The actual mausoleum part was closed but you can see in through the window to the coffins about a metre away which, seeing as you can't exactly climb in and shake hands with the Lawgiver himself, is about the same as able to go in. Inside the mosque is very nice and, as with all, has very helpful volunteers inside. The point of the mosque is that it's a lot more simple inside than, say, the Blue Mosque and that's fine, but is also why I felt it limited to a 4/5. An additional plus is the nice grounds and great views over the Bosphorus. "

Quieter than the Blue Mosque and even more elegant.You can get a goos appreciation of the way the mosque itself is at the heart of a complex of related buildings and open spaces. Wonderful views across the Golden Horn. On a more prosaic note we appreciated the super clean, smart and free loos! Be sure to stop for a drink in the very chilled tea garden in a sunken courtyard behind the mosque."

The simplicity of this enormous building complex and its gardens and surrounding buildings are breathtaking. The grand design of the most famous and talented of the imperial architects, Mimar Sinan pays proper tribute to its patron, Suleyman the Magnificent. The simple and clean lines, huge inner space, elegant wall ornaments and stained windows create a spiritual feeling not felt in other, more popular places."

It's a bit apart from the usual tourist attractions, located behind Istanbul University in the old town, on a hill overlooking the Golden Horn. It is a large mosque, beautiful in its own right and the tomb of Suleyman the magnificient and his wife are located on one side of the mosque. Both the tombs and the mosque are worth visiting and the garden will show you magnificent views. You can see Galata Tower across the Golden Horn. As an added bonus, it's a fine place to have lunch, because across from the mosque is a row of restaurants serving relatively cheap food, specializing in fasulye, the well-known bean dish of Turkey. I always go there on foot, usually starting from the Grand Bazaar and walking along the walls near Istanbul University, with the numerous small shops and the maze of Eminonu on one side. After the mosque, the other bonus is that you can navigate your way through the maze of shops and end up at the Spice Bazaar."

During the walk there are other things to see so it's not that bad.Once I got there I was dazzled by the majestic architecture the mosque displays, I propose coming there in the afternoon - close to sunset, when you can witness the colours of the sky contrasting the domes and the minarets of the mosque. If it happens that you've got there in the time of prayer don't sweat it, just lay down in the green flowery gardens and enjoy this quiet oasis in the city centre, there are people enjoying in the sun the same as you are. Once you get inside you can see the very best of Islamic art and culture, even more so since the mosque isn't so popular with tourists. There are guides inside who can tell you a bit more about the place and it's history. They can also get you acquainted with Islam in a not so pushy manner. Take your time to really feel the grandness and energy of the interior.Once you're done with your visit don't forget to take photos and enjoy the view of the Bosphorus from the eastern side of the mosque.Hope you will enjoy your visit as much as I have!"

As a first time visitor to Istanbul we may be confused by the names. Suleymaniye Mosque is named after the Sultan of the same name Sulaimaiye 1, built between 1550 - 1557. The Sultanahmet Mosque is actually the Blue Mosque, smaller than Sulaimaniye Mosque but more popular due to its location at Sultanahmet Square and the 21,000 izmit tiles adoring the pillars and ceiling.Sulaimaniye Mosque is located on top of a hill and that could one of the reasons why it is not as popular as the Blue Mosque as it is more difficult to climb uphill. This Mosque represents one of the finest structures ever built during the Ottoman Empire stretching from 1299-1923. It was built by non other than the most famous and greatest architect of the Ottoman era of all time, Sinan. The Mosque is considered Sultan Sulaiman and architect Sinan's master piece and rich in history. Both of them were known to have built hundreds of magnificient structures together.Unlike The Blue Mosque, The Sulaimaniye Mosque has less blue izmit tiles but there are blue stained glass windows all around. The location which is perched on top of a hill makes it the most imposing skyline of Istanbul of the Old City while Galata Tower represents the most imposing structure of the new city seen from the Old City. Some the good view of Istanbul could also be seen from the Mosque.Like The Blue Mosque, it is functional and operational Mosque used for daily prayers and Friday prayer. Occassionally, we will witness wedding ceremonies and photo shoot being taken inside the the Mosque to commemorate occassions of a lifetime memory. The position of Sulaimaniye Mosque as the biggest Mosque in Istanbul will soon end as the present Turkish Gornment is constructing a new Mosque on top of a hill on the Asian side which is much more bigger than the Sulaimaniye Mosque.The Sulaimaniye Mosque is located quite near to The Egyptian Bazaar or the Spice Bazaar and the Galata Bridge but it is advisable to take a taxi to go uphill to visit the Mosque. As a tourist in Istanbul, we must not missed the two most important Mosques, i.e the Sulaimaniye Mosque, being the biggest Mosque built during the reign of Sultan Sulaiman 1 and its reknown architect Sinan and the other Blue Mosque or its actual name The Sultanahmet Mosque, being the most popular Mosque built during the reign of Sultan Ahmet and architect student of Sinan, Mehmet Aga. In Istanbul Mosques are everywhere as there are about 3,000 Mosques altogether!.Saharudin & MariamVisited 30 August 2015Reporting: 03 September 2015"

It is lovely, beautiful architecture, well maintained, and there were young Muslim women inside who were happy to speak with us and explain the history of the Mosque and a little about the religion, the prayer rituals, etc. We did not need to employ a tour guide to enjoy this spot, The grounds are lovely, and their is a lovely view of the Bosphorus Strait. This is a much more serene, peaceful experience than visiting the more touristy Blue Mosque and I highly recommend it. We took a 20 lira cab drive form our hotel, but it was difficult to get a cab outside the mosque to return to our hotel. We walked a block or so away, waited about 40 minutes, and found a cab. It was all worth it!"

According to one story;the construction takes too long time and rumors about the laziness of architect Sinan reaches the Sultan's ear.With great anger he goes to the site and enters the semifinished building and sees Sinan with a pipe of a nargileh (Sisah) in his mouth sitting just under the dome.The Sultan yells at him and asks what he was doing. Sinan responds, \" your highness there is no fire and tobacco on the nargileh, I'm just listening the acoustics\".Another mith about Suleymaniye Mosque is;for the construction takes too long, a cest filled with gold and precious stones was donated from the Shah of Iran. Upon seeing this, Suleyman orders this content to be thrown into the concrete mixture to help strenghtening the walls.It is possibly a myth.After visiting Suleymaniye ask historic VEFA BOZACISI. It is a short walk away from the mosque. Visitors may take BOZA ( a fermented traditional drink) or SIRA (a fermented grape juice without alcohol) there and have a rest.Ice cream is good as well.Then you may walk horizontally to Grand Bazaar or down the hill to Eminonu."

The mosque itself and tombs are worth spending time in. If you fancy a little reflection time, this could be it. I came before the call to prayer, as i like to hear it. I sat in the grounds, and did not enter the mosque until about 40 minutes later. They provide coverings should you not be dressed appropriately, so you can relax and enjoy the experience."

A walk through the gardens brings you to the courtyard of the mosque where the ablution fountain is. On entry you will gasp at the magnificence of this complex designed and built by the master Mimar Sinan. Columns, arches, windows and the spectacular high dome beautfully decorated with arabic calligraphy leaves you breathless. make sure to go to the upper level for a view from the top. A definite masterpiece. When leaving you be lucky to encounter the traditionally dressed Ottman fruit juice sellers. make sure to take some pictures of yourself with them. on exit opposite the mosque is the humble tomb the the great master Mimar Sinan. The gate may be locked but nevertheless you can pay homage to this great builder."

They offered to take photo with us and while taking photo, the guy poured us drinks - we didn't ask for them, we didn't want them. I asked how much they were and in response they had started explaining in broken English that it is actually contribution for Mosque community? or something like that (but now I am certain that was a lie). So we figured, lets not offend them, it would be like 2-3 TL per peson or something like that anyway... NOOOO not even in ballpark. We finish our drinks...THEY WANT 14 TL FOR TWO SMALL DRINKS.

I gave money when I visited other mosques and there was no trouble at all, only here. It's hard not to give when children look hungry. There are a lot of Syrian children in Istanbul selling tissue papers or prayer beads, I bought stuff from them as a way of helping them. Please do the same if you can."

It isn't as ornate as the Blue Mosque, but has a great sense of serenity and airiness.Suleymaniye is the favorite mosque of several Muslim tour guides and now it's our family's favorite too. Fortunately, there weren't as many visitors there as the other big mosques in Istanbul so we were able to fully appreciate this masterpiece.

The focus of this review is the residential neighborhoods to the immediate northeast of the mosque complex. As you leave the mosque from the grassy area facing the new city, you see a set of stairs leading down to the street. At this point, make an almost U-turn along Mimar Sinan Cad. and wander towards, but don't go into, the Cafe Hali\u00e7 Seyi-Istanbul. (They have a great view but horribly overpriced menu). Along the way and as you make your way down toward the Golden Horn and Emin\u00f6n\u00fc, you will pass through neighborhoods that detail the history of the last several hundred years. You'll see Ottoman houses still standing, some partially devastated by earthquake and fires, some rebuilt, newer structures of stucco with distinct European influence, and slipped in between, newish houses and businesses that have taken advantage of changes in building codes and commercial trends. You will need a detailed map for any of this to make sense but my advice is to get \"lost\" in some of the residential areas of the old city and \"see\" the history of the city played out in the variety of building styles and conditions."

Over the last several months, I have visited numerous places of worship (St. Stephen's Basilica & Matthias Church (Budapest), St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral & West Minster Abbey (London), Jumeirah Mosque (Dubai) and Notre Dame (Paris). I have to say; the Suleymaniye Mosque wasn\u2019t that great for me. Seeing it form the outside as you approach is stunning. Unfortunately, I was unable to get great exterior photos. It felt very touristy and less like a place of worship. Those who were their praying seemed to be on display. It wasn't as quiet as other places I\u2019ve been. It just felt wrong to be in there. We were ushered through a line to get items to cover our heads, shoulders, and knees; we had to take our shoes off, so I was really expecting to find a peaceful and beautiful place of worship. That wasn't my experience at all. Don't get me wrong, it's nice inside and while the walls and ceilings are beautiful, there are these large iron chandeliers with the bright lights. I thought the lighting took away from the ambiance. It was just weird for me. I spent a total of about 10 minutes inside. \u2639 Disappointing."

It is beautiful - much more refined than the Blue Mosque and stunning in its more minimal style. The location is amazing - it looks out from its hilltop location over a sea of domes towards the Golden Horn and the Bosphorous. Less touristy than the Blue Mosque as well. Well worth a visit."

I have been there with or without tour guides and until the summer of 2014 I thought I more or less knew the most important there is to know about this marvelous city\u2026.and then we met Ensar. I had some friends visiting from the US and Norway and I had promised to them to Istanbul. A friend of mine offered me a tour guide who had made a great impression on them. I was pretty lazy myself so I agreed and called the guy and made appointments\u2026then we set off to what proved to be a lifetime experience for all of us. I rediscovered the city and found out that I had never actually known anything worth it about the place. Ensar took us to places off the beaten track, gave us so much extra and intercultural knowledge that we could never have got otherwise. With his zeal and dedication to what he is doing, Ensar made the 2 days round the landmarks of Istanbul feel like a few-hour\u2019s trip. At the end we felt we wanted to know and see more and as much as possible. That is why we booked right away for this year and this time I am going back with a larger bunch of friends. Thank you, Ensar for your hospitality (making us feel at home at any of the places we went), for the nice and unique sense of humor and for your patience. We can\u2019t wait to re-live this in a month and are looking forward for the itinerary you have prepared for us. R.S. "

The visit itself took much less time than I thought - once you're in, there's only really one main area to view (allbeit a very beautiful area!). Men and women need to be covered - as you're queuing, you pass a booth where the ladies will check that you're suitably attired. If you're not, they will lend you a cloth to cover up with. My suggestion would be to view the Blue Mosque before going to Hagia Sophia - although we really liked it here, the Hagia really blew us us away so this felt a little underwhelming in comparison. I think had we come here first we may have felt differently."

Apart from the praying hall (camii) and courtyard (avlu), the complex also included four Koran schools (medrese), bath houses (hamam), a hospital, a caravanserai (kervansaray, a roadside inn where travelers could rest) and a public kitchen (imaret) which served food to the poor; Muslims, Christians and Jews alike. Once inside, you\u2019ll find the mosque with 59 meters in length and 58 meters in width breathtaking in size. The main dome is 53 meters high, exactly double its diameter of 26,4 meters.Behind the mosque are a graveyard and two mausoleums, including the beautifully restored tombs of Sultan S\u00fcleyman I, his wife Roxelana (Haseki H\u00fcrrem), his daughter Mihrimah, his mother Dila\u015fub Saliha and his sister Asiye.Just outside of the mosque walls, at the front, is the tomb of architect Sinan. The latter is however not open to the public. If you can, take your time....."

If you are there and you didn't make the shortcut for mosqueseeing at Yeni Camii, I totally recommend you a visit of the S\u00fcleymaniye-Camii. It is suiting the mosqueskyline of Old Istanbul. You reach it after a walk through the tradeplaces at Eminln\u00fc harbour. If you are there you can take a rest in the beatuful garden inside the mosques area. Enjoy the view over Pera.Inside the mosque you will see one of the most astonishing interior designs made by the famous Architect Koca Mimar Sinan. He created, for example, a invisible window system, which kept the soot of the candles in the huge chandeliers hanging from the ceilingy, for producing ink out of it. Sustainability at it's best. "

I like that it is managed orderly so that prayer times are respected, yet tourists can be exposed to it and so too get an opportunity to appreciate it. So make sure you know what times you can visit. It was disappointing though to see how both locals and foreigners alike showed disrespect during pray time by snapping photos and selfies. if you fortunate enough to go to a friday sermon (Jummuah), go early to ensure you may be seated inside the mosque - definitely by noon."

The Mosque was build by order of Kanuni Sultan Suleyman, known in the West as Suleiman the Magnificent, in 16 century and it has historical cemetery with many great people resting there. You will find Great Ottoman Empire's Sultan Suleiman and his Russian wife Alexandra tombs in two buildings next to the Mosque. The great history of Sultan Suleyman and Hasiki Hurrem Sultan inspired creation of many books, movies in the world. The latest and may be the best historical drama movie I've ever seen was recently created in Turkey and named as \"Muhtesem Yuzyil\". I'd recommend watch this movie at first, as we've done with my wife, before visiting Istanbul and the Mosque and Topkapi Palace."

Of the 3,500 mosques in Istanbul, the Suleymaniye is likely the most important as it was built by Sinan, perhaps the world's greatest architect for Suleyman the Magnificent, perhaps the Ottoman empire's greatest Sultan. Built on the grounds of a historic palace in the 1550s, this mosque served as a charitable foundation featuring a hospital, schools, a caravanersai, soup kitchens, and a bath house, as well as a place of worship. The mosque served as a massive support system for over 1,000 of the poor of Istanbul, regardless of religion. This mosque dominates the skyline of Istanbul, beautiful beyond belief.The Suleymaniye has a massive courtyard featuring historic columns from earlier civilizations, a soaring golden interior with a massive dome whose height is double its diameter, a lovely gateway, and the tombs of Suleyman the Magnificent and of Sinan, his architect. Scholars say that Mimar Sinan was a Christian Armenian youth adopted into the elite palace schools via the annual roundup of talented Christian youths via the desrime (draft of the young). After serving as a Janissary military engineer, he became chief Imperial architect to Suleyman I in 1538, building over 131 mosques and 200 other buildings as well as bridges and forts. Sinan is most frequently compared to Michelangelo. Many regard Sinan as the world's greatest architect."

However, this mosque is a MUST SEE! When we arrived to the courtyard area I was stunned at how large the mosque and grounds actually were! The domes are larger and more obvious than the other mosques we visited during our stay in Istanbul. The grounds were clean and are well kept, also the washrooms were spotless which was a plus. The interior was of course spotless- as were all the mosques in Istanbul. But the interior of Suleymaniye Camii was just more breathtaking to me. It seemed higher up when looking at ceilings and the temperature was great inside - especially on a hot spring day. Another wonderful aspect was the view from the side of the courtyard. You get a great view of the Golden Horn and the cityscape. Go to this mosque and you won't regret it!"

It's not clearly marked so you have to ask....you will see the mosque towering over the hill.When I entered the actual mosque it was in COMPLETE AWE. The second you step inside you are completely taken aback. IT IS SO PERFECT! The grass is the lushest green and the mosque is amazing inside and out. I couldn't get enough of it. From the border of the mosque, you can get a panoramic view of the city and the bosphorus. I want to go back so badly. I would kick myself if I didn't visit! You should read up on the great architect Sinan before you go to get some background.Ladies please cover your heads and bodies, as this is the etiquette and must be respected. You will get some awesome photos here. It's definately less busy than the blue mosque.You do have to pay a small fee if you want to use the washrooms which are located on the outside border of the mosque, other than that, free."

Inside the mosque,in an enclosure scarved ladies were studying Quran Tafsir as per routine.

After the Blue Mosque this is probably the next most 'must do' Mosque in Istanbul.There are multiple reasons to come here. Firstly if you are relatively fit and are in the New Mosque/Spice Market area you can walk up the hill towards it. Secondly it is the site of the tomb of Suleyman the Magnificent. Thirdly it.... well thirdly it is a really impressive structure when you consider how old it is and how stupidly impressive it must have been at the time of its construction.As an added bonus there are lovely views over to the Galata area of the city including the Galata Tower.Apart from the interest of seeing this very impressive structure there is the added bonus that you feel that you are in a mellower part of the city. There is far less street noise and hustle and bustle here than, say, at the Blue Mosque. The interior is as impressive as the exterior and rewards a bit of reflection.One tiny problem is the fact that the place is accessed by some narrow old streets - and once you are in them you are guided by instinct as to where it is because once you are in those narrow streets it can be hard to get your bearings by being able to see the minarets! But you'll get there. And it will be worth it."

Miss the queues at the Blue Mosque and come here instead!"

Despite this it receives only a fraction of the popularity and visitors as its famous cousin. It was built in the 1500\u2019s under the direction of Mimar Sinan and is structurally similar to the blue mosque. A famous point of difference is in the garden behind the main mosque which contains the two mausoleums containing the tombs of Sultan Suleiman I and his wife Hurrem.It is free to enter although the standard dress code applies (women need scarves). It is an uphill walk from the grand bizarre. The two things I enjoyed most were (1) The spectacular views of the bosphorous (2) The steep reduction in tourist numbers. This allows you time to explore the interior of the mosque without being herded like cattle, a process which steeply undermined the blue mosque.I definitely think it\u2019s worth the extra effort getting here."

It uses earthquake-proof technology with rings around the foundations of its minarets, that was only found out later when modern engineers was going to add them.It also has ventilations to manage the flow of smokes from candles that were used to light the inside of the mosque, so that the smokes did not stain the walls.Another bright thing is that it uses ostrich eggs hung together with the chandeliers that is said to repel unwanted animals such as snakes and scorpions with the frequency generated from the eggs.From the back yard you can see a beautiful view to the sea."

It is relatively new, being only 500 years old as opposed to the 1500 for Ayasofia. The floor space is enormous but is fairly sterile. While the Ayasofia is geared for tourists, Suleymaniye is a working mosque and is, therefore, primarily a place of worship, not a tourist attraction. The requirements for entry are similar to going to the great Basilicas in Rome, i.e.men and women must have their legs covered and women must cover their hair. However, unlike Rome, if you don't have the wherewithal, they will provide a wrap to cover legs and scarves for hair. The interior is very solemn and one is reminded of the nature of the building. The walls are covered with blue decoration, hence the name, which is truly beautiful. It is well worth the time spent, but don't expect the wall to wall antiquity of Ayasofia. It is a place of worship and deserves the respect one should give it."

You can only fully appreciate how beautiful it is by actually being there.There is a designated visitor entrance, they do not allow you to enter during prayer times so you may have to wait to enter however this was no problem as you can explore the outside.This mosque was also far less busy than the Blue Mosque."

Situated within a walled compound, you could miss one of its many entrances if you didn't know how to find it. The compound itself was very beautiful, just like a small park. The view of Istanbul from here was priceless. Inside the mosque, it was serene with few much fewer tourists than the Blue Mosque. Guides are also available if you have any questions about the mosque or Islam."

They provide them at the very popular sites such as the Blue Mosque, but they are not provided here, and it would be a shame to miss out on seeing it for that reason. The inside of this mosque is beautiful, and it has a much less touristy feel than the blue mosque. The courtyard is also very nice. It's definitely worth a visit. It's very near the Grand Bazaar, so I would definitely pair these sites together in a day."

Entry system for enforcing modesty and shoelessness (a form of respect) was a little awkward, but an active mosque has an awkward job of supporting worshipers and allowing tourists inside. Tourists can be obtrusive and offensive, noisy, disrespectful, and distracting. I wish the authorities well in their effort to balance their different constituents. It was lovely to see the inside and to appreciate the great sultan's work. I enjoyed learning about the impact of the mosque on the whole neighborhood, its role in building the market and hosting and feeding travelers and the poor.

If time is a big issue I would see the Blue Mosque first and Hagia Sophia and the Grand Bazaar but with light crowds and more than two days you can fit it in. It has a very informative wall with an English explanation of the Muslem faith and how it originated and what their beliefs are. We found this very enlightening.

The style of the mosque is extraordinary elegant despite the enormous dimensions of the building. The mosque was damaged by a fire in 17th century and an earthquake in18th century. Part of the restoration was not successful and acoustic deteriorated. There are two mausoleums behind the mosque with the tombs of the sultan and his wife and other members of the dynasty. The mausoleum of the sultan is now under reconstruction but you can look inside trough the small windows. The tomb of Sinan is on the other side of the mosque, so the great master, the Ottoman Michelangelo, remained close to his masterpiece in the eternity.Before leaving, enjoy the nice view to the town and the Golden Horn from the large terrace."

There is a stunning Italian rococo ceiling and the interior is calm, peaceful and religiously significant.We were approached by a mosque volunteer who answered questions in various languages and was extremely keen to help with queries about the building and Islam.

The courtyard, views and restaurants in front are great. In particular Dar\u00fclziyafet on a side street inside a courtyard is true gem. If you have time check S\u00fcleymaniye and later on walk to Spice Market. On your way you will see the R\u00fcstempa\u015fa (Rustempasha) Mosque with marvellous tiles, again from Sinan himself.

It was built on the order of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent by the royal architect Mimar Sinan in the middle of the 16th century. Sinan tried to rival with Hagia Sophia. To achieve the same effect of unsupported dome, he hid the massive pillars, which support the dome, inside the walls. Although not as large as Hagia Sophia, the S\u00fcleymaniye is brighter, thanks to light coming from the huge amount stained-glass windows. The interior decoration is minimal, with white marble, ivory and very restrained use of Iznik tiles. And probably because the light and discreet decorations, it`s more serene and majestic than the Blue Mosque. It`s also much less touristy, although lately tourists are beginning to discover this place, primarily due to the popularity of the show \u201cMagnificent Century\u201d. In the garden behind the mosque are mausoleums of Sultan Suleiman de Magnificent and his favorite wife H\u00fcrrem Sultana (Roxelana). So if you are fan of the \u201cMagnificent Century\u201d, it`s the absolute must! Sadly the tombs are not open to the public."

Upon entering note that you need to take off your shoes/footwear although you can pick a plastic bag at the entrance for packing and putting inside your bag. It is advised that visitors wear long pants (below knees) and shirt/tops with sleeves. This applies to both men and women. The inner part of the mosque is divided into 2 -the common area which visitors can stay and observe and the prayer area. The prayer area is only for Muslim faithful who would like to pray. The sides of the mosque is for ladies. Look above and see the nice, artistic and colorful presentation of some verses from Quran. Notice the huge columns that support the mosque. be amazed by the lights hanging above. Take time to sit for a few minutes (15 mins minimum) and observe the faithfuls pray.Of course, dont leave the mosque with out taking pics. Bring your wide angle and low light lens to capture the beauty of the place.Note: some part of the mosque is undergoing repair.If this review has given you insight, please click \"helpful\" below."

One big advantage I saw you can find opposite the mosque souvenirs shops and it is much cheaper than sultanahmed area and grand bazaar ever before negotiating the price, also some good local restaurants opposite the mosque with good prices.You will see some beggars mainly women and children but you can ignore them and continue enjoying your visit. You can go there by tram (T1 Line) and you can walk for about 15 Min to reach the mosque I do not remember the tram stop but you can ask there some advice. Avoid taking Taxi; I had a bad experience with Taxi drivers, deliberately they take a longer path and sometimes they do tricks in the fare calculator that you might pay 5 times the actual fare. I strongly recommend using Tram or Metro while moving between your favorite places and your hotel."

The silence which greeted us seemed from another world. The carpeting, the most exquisite I've seen, silences not only footsteps but distractions in one's own mind; something that heals and eases the soul. Praying in such a place, regardless of religion becomes natural and I prayed for all inside and outside the mosque. The scuplture, window designs, lighting, carpeting and the very size creates a unique and monumentally beautiful place in the world."

You can't miss the mosque, it's huge and sits on top of the hill not so far from the Blue Mosque etc. Women must drape a scarf on their heads and be dressed modestly to enter. They will provide you with a cloak and scarf if you need one. The grounds are beautifully kept. We were a little disappointed when we went to see Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent's tomb because it was locked up and not easy to see from windows. I had to zoom in with my camera to see which tomb was his. They could at least let people have a better view from the window. His wife's tomb had worse visibility. Not worth opening up the area if we can't see anything. It's located in the cemetery that had lists of people's name. It would have been nice to have brief on who generally was buried in the cemetery and how far back they're dated. Staff were quite protective and aggressive at the entrance of the mosque. I understand it's their job to make sure we're respectful when entering but a smile and explanation is far better than a scowl and an order. All that being said, it's a beautiful mosque on beautiful grounds. You should definitely see it."

You can also go in the courtyard and get a better look at the building, but to get into the actual mosque, you either have to be a muslim going for a prayer, or you queue up to go in the side entrance. We queued as we were tourists and it was 40 minutes and tourists were being whisked through the fast lane as they were on a promise of seeing the tour guides brother's carpet shops afterwards (good luck with that). We did get inside, and as I said earlier for something so old, it is pretty impressive. The tiles are fantastic all over the walls and ceilings, but there is disrepair and not much repair work being carried out. For the amount of money that is paid into the coffers next door at the museum of the Hagya Sofia , money should be spent here repairing the beautiful ceiling work,"

There was construction going on, of course, so part of the inside was blocked with ceiling high scaffolding. There's no artifacts, just decor and some artwork. We ventured up the circular medium-easy ramps (no stairs) to the top. There's good views of the space below, and you get up close views of the mosaic tiles and other art work.

This mosque lies near some of the best authentic old wooden houses in the city but, being with a high intensity tour party, there was no time to see them. If you have time, do visit them.This mosque stood out from others for the following reasons; there are a whole host of ancillary buildings (some not presently open) such as a library, hospital, soup kitchen, madrassa and so on so very much a community centre and not just a mosque. The fact these buildings survive marks out this mosque from others where they have disappeared over the ages. It has an extensive and interesting graveyard, also the tomb (not open when we were there) of Suleyman the Magnificent who had the mosque built and his wife Roxelana; also the tomb of the architect Sinan \u2013 many consider this building his finest work though he did not agree nevertheless he chose to be buried here.The decoration inside is restrained compared to other major mosques in the city and refreshing for that. Stained glass, as a result, makes more impact than in other mosques. The carpet is different in that it has individual \u2018cells\u2019 marked out for worshippers rather than just \u2018get down where you fancy\u2019. The chandeliers make just the right degree of impact given the restraint of the background decoration. All in all, a very pleasing and not over-elaborate interior.The graveyard is worth lingering over with its fine range of quite different stones. Exterior decoration and stone features again differentiate this mosque from the others in their relative simplicity. Don\u2019t miss this place \u2013 it has a lot to offer than Agia Sofia and The Blue Mosque do not and it is substantially less visited even though it is a few minutes\u2019 walk from the Grand Bazaar."

In contrast to many other buildings, this mosque is elegantly simple with some stenciling around the moldings, emphasizing the beauty of the structure. There are also some interesting design features (that one has to really look for), such as a small room above the front entrance where the soot from all the burning candles is collected to be reused for writing. When we visited there were only a few other people, so we could enjoy the serenity and appreciate the massiveness of the space. The grounds are also beautiful and are the site of Suleman the Magnificent and his wife, Roxelana's, tombs which were not open when we were there.

There is no fee of course. A must-go in Istanbul in my opinion. It is not very far from Sultanahmet, just about 1 mile(1,5-2 kilometres)."

I personally got far more out of my visit by understanding the history and how the buildings use has changed through the various stages of Turkey\u2019s occupation right through to the current day. Well worth a visit. Remember to check the times you can enter so you aren\u2019t disappointed."

It is much less crowded than the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia and just as beautiful. There are lovely grounds to stroll around and the inside is just as nice as the other mosques. As with all religious sites, you should be conscious of what you are wearing. Woman, you will be fine wandering around the grounds but if you plan to go inside the mosque make sure you have your legs and shoulders covered. They provide robes to put on if you do not have the right clothing but it is easier to just be prepared on your own. Throw a scarf in your purse to cover your head and you can throw it back in when you are done. You will have to remove your shoes when you are inside but they provide bags to carry them around. From the mosque is a short downhill walk to the Grand Bizarre so it is not as out of the way as it looks from afar."

I've visited BlueMosque before i came to Suleymaniye Mosque, unlike BM, Suleymaniye Mosque is very peaceful, and less attention from the tourist... not as grand as BM, but Suleymaniye Mosque has it's own charm which no words can describe... i got emotional here for some reason, and i truly charmed by it's peacefulness and calmness when i'm sitting at one corner and admire it's beauty. The courtyard is a great place to unwind, and chill... I love the fact that you can visit the mosque even when they are praying... as long as you don't take photos during the praying period. Don't miss to go around the mosque, in the garden behind the main mosque there are two mausoleums including the tombs of Sultan Suleiman I, his wife H\u00fcrrem Sultan (Roxelana) and his daughter Mihrimah Sultan. The sultans Suleiman II, Ahmed II and also Saliha Dila\u015fub Sultan and Safiye Sultan (died in 1777), the daughter of Mustafa II, are buried here.How to get there: Take tram from ferry port towards Grand bazaar, and alight at Grand Bazzar station. Walk towards the north east direction. Quite a bit of walk but is worth your time."

It is situated on top of a hill, so a little bit of a walk, but worthwhile your effort. The surrounding area is quiet with beautiful lush green shady trees and lawns. There is much less tourists here because its off the beaten track, but therefore you will be blessed with silence around you and a peaceful atmosphere when visiting this mosque. To enter, you must be aware of the dress code. You will be given some robes to cover yourself if you are not properly dressed. The interior and exterior architecture are really awesome. The court yard infront of the main entrance is huge. Be advised not to visit during prayer times (also closed for tourists 30 minutes before and after prayer times). On the one side of the mosque you will see a row of water taps next to the wall. The men who are coming to pray, will wash their hands and feet here before entering the mosque. When you leave, use the exit of the complex at this side, cross the street and walk a short way (50 m) uphill into the grounds of the university. Be on the look-out for some stairs on your left ascending to an open rooftop-area. From here you will be able to take the most magnificent photos of the Suleymaniye's beautiful domes and miniarettes as well as panoramic views of the Bosphorus. This is not only the biggest mosque in Istanbul, but also one of our favourites. Make some time in your itinerary to visit this awesome place."

One of the great mosques in Istanbul, is the Sultan Suleymaniye Mosque located in the Fatih District of Old Istanbul, about 10 minutes wlaking distance from another great mosque in the same district (Sultan Mehmed II Mosque). When taking a Bhosporus cruise, The Suleymaniye Mosque presents a very impressive view. It dominates the skyline on the Bhosporus strait. Timing the visit to this most is critical since it was closed to tourists at 2:30 PM and 5:30 PM wjen we were there to visit. Once inside the mosque, one can't help but be amazed at the amazing muslim decorations. Intricately drawn symmetrical patterns dominate the \"nave\" of the mosque. Circle of lights for the muslim devotees create an impressive but simple environment to pray facing Mecca.We did not know that muslim women are not allowed in the main prayer area. A relatively small area hidden from the main prayer area are reserved for women to pray from. Turkish women do not wear the usual muslim apparels that are worn by other muslim women. In fact, we learned that it was illegal to use the hijab, nikab, or burka by Turkish women. The women wearing the usual muslim attires are mostly women tourists coming from other Arab nations who come to Istanbul, we were told.The Sultan Suleyamniye Mosque is comparable to the Sultan Ahmet Mosque (The Blue Mosque), but only have 4 minarets compared to the 6 minarets in the Blue Mosque. Women tourists are required to have a head covering, and shoes must be removed (handy plastic bags are given to everyone who enters the mosque). We saw muslim men washing their feet, hands, arms, and face is a cleansing station outside the mosque, which we did not know before. The building architecture of this mosque is quite impressive, and rivals that of the Blue Mosque. Certainly, a must place to see and visit when in Istanbut. It is free, i.e. no charge to visit, just like the other mosques in Istanbul, so we're told."

When approaching Istanbul from the area of Galatta Bridge it is the Suleymaniye Mosque that dominates the skyline and once you get nearby you realize how big it actually is. Visitors are requested to dress modestly and to put shoes in a plastic bag and it was quite amusing to see some young men who arrived in shorts and vests being told to put on a loose skirt and shawl before entering. Once inside you can marvel at the structure and ornate decor and reflect on the skills that were required to produce such a magnificent building. In addition to the mosque the surrounding area was built as a social complex and within the grounds also stands the building housing the tomb of Suleyman the Magnificent."

We were fortunate enough to be brought to this Mosque by our private guide we hired for the day through our hotel; she also happened to be an art Historian and a young Professor at a local University. I wanted to pass on her insight to everyone about this Mosque. The famed Ottoman architect Sinan built this Mosque and deemed it his second favorite next to Selimiye Mosque he built in Edime. It is a fact that Sinan is buried here at this Mosque, but what Historians believe, based on his own modest design of his crypt and the placement at the which he located it for burial... very bottom right corner, it is like an artist signature on a painting. I found that fascinating, and the Mosque and gardens are peaceful and beautiful in their own right, even without the back story, which made it more special to me."

It doesn't have the crowds that the Blue Mosque has. I advise women to wear long pants, and have their own light head scarf. If you have shorts on, even long shorts, they will give you a 'skirt' (sack) to wear over your clothes, which on reflection I would just wear long pants. A tshirt is fine (shoulders and hair must be covered), and you take your shoes off on entry, they give you a plastic bag to carry your shoes.Hope the practical information helps."

Sadly the interior of the Hagia Sophia makes the city's other grand spaces seem somewhat muted, but it is worth inspecting the interior of the mosque, although the large prayer area somewhat limits exploration. The cemetery behind the mosque is beautiful and not to be missed, as is the view over the city."

Inside the mosque, behind the women's screen, we could see women sitting with each other quietly talking and praying. One of the best things about travel, is seeing how other people live, eat, and worship. We had a private guide who provided much insight into Suleymaniye and why he is truly magnificent.

            "review": "Excellent, but not as much for the interior. This isn't super central--a 10 minute, dull walk from the bazaar--so it has far fewer tourists than the Blue Mosque. There was no line when I went, while the line at the Blue Mosque had stretched 200 meters long (waiting for it to reopen after afternoon prayers). The interior space is graceful and huge, but other than sitting and admiring it there isn't much to do, unless you read Arabic script that lines the walls. Remove your shoes, and sit behind the barriers, people watching a bit (e.g., non-Muslim tourists and Muslim women who can only pray from the back). The exterior offers more to enjoy and learn from. There are tombs, including Sinan's, and you also get a great sense of how Islam provides a full social system, with the equivalent of a modern day soup kitchen for the poor (now a restaurant) and school. The mosque has very nice grounds: green grass, great courtyard, all more pleasant than the Blue Mosque. Across the street, there is a long row of restaurants that are less touristy, specializing in Turkish beans. But don't miss the below-ground courtyard outside the southwest corner of the Mosque--great atmosphere. And the bathrooms on the grounds of the mosque are clean and free (unlike the Blue Mosque, for which you have to pay a lira). Of course, by night, you can see the mosque beautifully illuminated, but I don't care for this neighborhood at night--it seems that you have to walk some fairly quiet and in some cases dodgy, barren streets to get to and from here, especially if you're going back toward the Golden Horn / Galata bridge neighborhoods. All told, this is a nice sight to see, but I can't see how it is currently the #2 rated attraction on TripAdviser. It should be more like your #6 to #8-ranked attraction."

This cafe is mostly visited by students of Istanbul Uni, Menu is all in Turkish but try to find an english speaking waiter and they can help. Prices are much cheaper.

It occupies a significant amount of ground space - incorporating not only the Mosque and its courtyard but also a school and two mausoleums - the tombs of Sultan Suleiman I and his wife Roxelana; both significant historical figures. The beauty and the atmosphere of Suleymaniye Mosque must be experienced. Being a little removed from Sultanahmet Square it is less thronged and more peaceful. It is a beautiful, serene and deeply spiritual place. The architecture is at once both impressive and sublime, every detail delicately woven together to create a place of awe and beauty. Spend some time soaking up the atmosphere and allow yourself experience this wonderful place. It is an active Mosque so be aware of prayer times, particularly on a Friday as there will be - understandably - restrictions on your visit. It is within ten minutes walking distance of the Grand Bazaar - come out from the opposite side to the metro station end; we found it very easily with a simple map as a guide. Indeed the area surrounding it is very historic and we found some good shopping too. A definite attraction to visit."

The building is beautiful and ornate and not unlike the Blue Mosque however, being less busy made it a more enjoyable experience.The cemetery is supposed to be open to visit but I have been by it several times and its always closed with no real explanation. I see this has been an issue for many people based on a variety of reviews on numerous sites.My comment for all religious sites is to do some research ahead of time and know the customs and some basics of the religion as that will really help understand the site."

Walk around it as well, you get to see the mausolium through the walls.Respect the times of prayer, when the mosque will also be restricted. As for the restaurants and cafes near by, they're great, but some very touristic, I would recommend something more traditional a bit further away.Walking distance from both Eminonu and the Grand Bazaar, but note that it's uphill from Eminonu, while the walk from the Bazaar is mostly straight. (There's also a Metro stop right outside) I would recommend the walk from Eminonu though, you get to see the 'sokaks' and the true \"spirit\" of the European side of Istanbul."

My favorite is Rustem Pasha, a small and most exquisite tiled mosque with such beauty and tranquility above the spice market. Have been there 7 times and will again.By the way, the paragraph that credits Sinan with building the Hagia Sophia also is incorrect. It was built long before the Ottoman Empire conquered the Greeks, converting it to a mosque and covering the Byzantium tiles of Christianity and icons depicting the Biblical stories. Minarets were added a couple of centuries later.Don't miss this amazing city and country!"

One further comment: I am not sure why the tripadvisor entry says that the architect Sinan was also responsible for Hagia Sophia, which is roughly 1000 years older than the Sulemaniye. The older building was designed by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidorus of Miletus, under orders of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian, in 537."

The cemetery overall was a lovely spot. The Mosque itself is very tranquil, as noted. We were the only Westerners there at the time and felt very welcome.

I was introduced to this mosque on an amazing Prive Istanbul walking tour and I fell in love with the view from the back of the mosque where the grassy area is, way at the far left corner, with the mosque on your right. WOW. That's all I can say. The mosque is very beautiful as well. Check out the digital clocks that keep track of the prayer times. During prayer times e.g. lunchtime, the mosque is closed to visitors. If this happens to you, go to the nearby lokanta which is on the Mosque grounds, there are tables on a terrace, and point and choose what you'd like to try from the eight to ten steaming cauldrons in the kitchen for a delicious, authentic and very reasonable meal. If you can manage it, you can ask for some of each! Being so close to the mosque, no alcohol is served, but sparkling water(soda), soft drinks and refreshing pomegranate (nar) juice is. By the time your lunch is over, the mosque should be open to visitors. The nearest restroom might be the one by the mosque and it has one sit down and one squat toilette on the women's side."

The S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque was built on the order of Sultan S\u00fcleyman in only 8 years (1550-1558) but suffered over the centuries damages because of two fires and one earthquake. The courtyard is extremely beautiful and has four minarets (only the sultan could build 4 minarets, princes and princesses could construct two minarets and others only one) The dome is very high, but still smaller than that of Hagia Sophia. The interior is very large and incredibly beautiful. I had the chance to attend the services, and I was really impressed by how beautiful the imam was preaching about the importance of helping those in need. Any tourist could attend the services, regardless of their religion with the sole condition to be dressed decently and women to cover themselves with a veil. In the garden there are two mausoleums, including the tombs of Sultan S\u00fcleyman his wife Roxelana (Haseki H\u00fcrrem), his daughter Mihrimah, his mother Dila\u015fub Saliha and his sister Asiye.All in all, it is a beautiful place that I wholeheartedly recommend !"

Muslims have greater opportunity to see the mihrab if u were to pray there.tips: after visiting the inside the mosque i suggest wallking around to the gardens and see the view from the terrace. Note to muslims, the carpet here is harder compared to the other mosques"

It is the only Mosque that has been able to elicit in this rather non-reglious individual a sense of transcendence, if only for a fewbrief moments. There is is tranquility and solemnity embodied in the arcietecture and artwork that no other mosque possesses. The Blue Mosque is a little more spectacular and ornate, but doesn't convey the sense of spirituality one feels washing over you at the Suleymaniye. It is a sensation not experienced by me in any of the many spectacular cathedrals in Western Europe (iwth one possible exception...not the Sistene, no St. Peter's, but the more modest but still impressive Orvieto Cathedral in Umbria)"

A shame that (as with many other Mosques at the moment) the tombs to the rear are closed for renovation, and rather surprisingly we were charged 5TYL entrance. I have absolutely no problem paying, but it was the one and only time this happened."

Designed by Sinan himself, it was made as a counterpoint to the Haghia Sophia, in order to show that the Ottoman empire could build as well as the 5th century Romans. Unfortunately, the skilled workers or the knowledge of stonework had disapeared in Constantinople by then.Never fear, Sinan had other options, and constructed a heavily domed mosque with an amazing sense of earthiness and sacredness, a very large open space for worship, and some of the best tilemakers in the empire were recruited for the project. The result is what is called the Blue Mosque, the most magnificent mosque in Istanbul, and one to match almost any in any part of the world. It features high ceilings, low oil lamps on very long ropes, and tree like columns to support the dome and demi domes that make up the ceiling. Did I mention the beautiful tiles, both calligraphic and graphic, or the sight of thousands of square feet of floor covered in beautiful turkish rugs? It is best to visit during prayer time, and participate. it;s not hard to take off ones shoes, and do what the Muslims do, leaving out the singing. it gives you an idea of the PURPOSE of the building, and it is still very much used. It is a key to Learning about Istanbul."

He has often been compared with the biblical King Solomon, and this mosque with the 1st Temple of Jerusalem that the latter constructed. It is an enormous complex sitting prominently on one of the 7 hills of the city. The Mosque is of course the main edifice, and it is approached through a splendid large courtyard containing a central fountain (that rarely operates) and some fine blue ceramic tiles. Four towering Minarets testify to his being the 4th ruler of the conquered city, and each has 10 external galleries signifying that he was the 10th Sultan of the Ottoman dynasty.As in all Mosques, you must take off your shoes before entering, and women must wear a head scarf. Once inside, the enormity of the interior is overwhelming. The magnificent dome is supported by 4 enormous pillars referred to as \"elephants legs\" and by 4 half-domes. The decoration is sparse and understated, comprising calligraphy panels, some sparkling stained glass windows, a pulpit for the Imam, and a section known as the \"monastery\" that is separated from the rest of the interior by a beautifully wrought grille covered in gold. The interior, that was dark and dull during our last visit 26 years ago, is now bright and shining after a renovation during which the original historic carpet were removed to a museum, and replaced by a single uniform carpet of uninteresting design and no artistic merit.We next saw briefly the cemetery and the Mausoleums in which Suleyman and Roxane (his favourite wife) are buried. We had a quick glance at the exteriors of the Koranic School, the Hospital, and the huge Kitchen that was the city's \"food bank.\" It is remarkable what a civilizing force Islam proved to be in those times."

The inside is more painted than tiled (again a contrast to the Blue Mosque) and its simplistic but strong lines evoke understated power.If you are fortunate to have a Muslim guide, you will also learn much about the Islamic faith and the variety of ways the population finds to practice it.

You can find a lot of information on this site through different apps n websites.

Then walk through the narrow stones carpeted lanes towards the sea."

There are two entrances, one for those worshipping and the other for visitors. Entrance is free.When we visited (just before noon) the Mosque wasn't too busy. Like the Blue Mosque a lot of the inside area was partitioned off for those praying.There was a calmness within the building which we didn't feel in Blue Mosque and this continued to the outside courtyard.This didn't feel so much like a tourist trap but more of a 'working' mosque which welcomed visitors."

The entrance we found was in a little alcove and would have been missed had it not been for our 10 year old who always walks slower than the rest of us. Once in the courtyard the building is safe and beautiful. There were only four or five other families there so we got a really good look. It is definitely worth visiting. It is not far from the Grand Bazaar so you can work it in on the same day as it won't take too long to see."

It actually takes longer to pull your shoes on and off than to tour the inside. The Blue Mosque is similar - impressive from the outside but underwhelming on the inside. This is my overall conclusion on Istanbul - impressive from a distance but up close it is dirty and full of hard selling salesman trying to prey on tourists.

Visit the mosque and walk around the old hospital and various accommodations, kitchen and mess halls. Part of the complex is under renovation"

So the view is amazing from the mosque.We've seen the place night time, so with all the lights, the whole ambiance was very spiritual to me. It was more quite than the Blue Mosque (probably because many people don't like to walk the uphill). But the outcome is really rewarding, so wear your sneakers and walk. The mosque's name belongs to one of the greatest sultans of the Ottoman Empire. And I liked the symbolism used by the architect. For instance there are 4 minarets because Suleyman the magnificent is the 4th sultan to rule since they've took the city, we've been told. Or there are 10 minaret balconies because Suleyman the Magnificent is the 10th sultan to rule the Ottoman Empire.We've been told that Sultan was madly in love with his wife and both of their tombs are in the special garden, side by side.There are many details that makes this architecture interesting and more meaningful so I would advise a little bit of reading before the visit.Wear comfy, walking shoes and remember that this place is still a \"praying\" location so be considerate choosing your outfit for the day."

Nevertheless, you will pass through some very interesting neighborhoods...There's an orange juice vendor right outside the mosque...for 1 TL, there is no better thirst quencher!We got to the mosque at around 5 PM...close to prayer time. This worked out very well for us. It gave us time to walk around the mosque complex and gardens. There were a bunch of kids playing soccer in the mosque grounds...all in all, made for a very interesting half hour before they opened the mosque to visitors. Bright insides... the lovely red and white/ silver border to the arches, the intricate calligraphy, the overall lack of crowds made the Suleymaniye Mosque my #1 attraction of Istanbul (The Chora Church comes a close second)."

Sit on the floor in the visitor area and gaze up at the ceiling and then from one domed ceiling to the next and one wall to the next and one pillar to the next. Take your time, truly taking it all in. It is a feast for the eyes. At night during Ramadan (the month of fasting), they hang a message in lights between the minarets that we could see from our hotel room which added to our bias for this mosque over the Blue Mosque.

After back tracking and coming up empty handed, I approached the guard at the door because I felt sure that any tourist would have handed it in to a guard (as I would do). The guard at the door was very unhelpful. I went to check again and returned to the same guard to ask him again. He had been joined by another guard who I think must have been somewhere inside the mosque. I persisted and asked again and again describing my camera case over and over. Eventually the second guard pulled it out of his pants pocket! This left a sour taste for a lovely attraction. I agree with the other reviewer, I would not visit this attraction on foot after dark, the area surrounding the mosque seems a bit dodgy."

Make sure to wander the grounds - large trees provide shade from the summer sun.

It is a masterpiece of the famous architect Mimar Sinan, though it is less famous than the Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmet), and hence doesn\u2019t have the huge flow of visitors and tourists. The mosque was commissioned by the greatest and richest of all Ottoman sultans, S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent and took seven years to build.As we entered the mosque precinct, we noticed the four minarets, a number only allowed for mosques commissioned by a sultan. The minarets have a total of 10 galleries or balconies, which we understood signified that S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent was the 10th Ottoman sultan. The mosque design seems to draw inspiration in style from the Hagia Sophia. The interior is simple but do check out the spectacular coloured stained glass windows, the baroque decoration on its domes and the beautiful Arabic calligraphy reciting verses from the Koran on the Mosque\u2019s walls.Just outside of the mosque walls, do care to see the small, understated, humble tomb of architect Mimar Sinan, which he had designed himself. So in Istanbul, if you wish to see a mosque for the \u2018experience\u2019, then S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque is a must visit."

The exterior isn't anything special, but the interior is absolutely stunning.Entrance is free, but keep in mind that no shoes are allowed and also of the dress code (i.e., men must cover legs and shoulders; women must cover the same plus their head). Make sure you plan around prayer times, as the mosque is closed during these times.The courtyard in the back of the mosque has great views of the Eminonu District and Golden Horn waterway.Highly recommended!"

The entire building appears to be better preserved than the blue mosque. It is appears to be less crowded than the popular Blue Mosque. And I am glad to say, it is also less foot odor. Around 850 meter apart, it is within walking distance of the Grand Bazaar. The walk is mostly downhill and lined up with merchants that cater more towards the locals instead of tourist. Follow the eventual wall on your left. Turn left continue to follow the wall. The mosque will be on the right. As any active mosque, admission is free; however, there is a small fee for the use of their toilets. If the first toilet you encountered is a squat version, don\u2019t panic, the next one might looks more familiar."

A working mosque but you can enter to see architect Sinan's magnificent structure from the inside as well as wander through the enclosed courtyard - look at the central fountain hidden behind a fret work casing. Less busy than the Blue Mosque which makes for a very relaxed visit. This mosque is at the top of one of Istanbul's seven hills - just walk up and up from the bus station a bit of a climb but very worthwhile. There are several small cafes and restaurants just outside the mosque's garden walls patronised by locals and very reasonable so visit in the morning and enjoy lunch here.The very best external view of this mosque is from the Galata Tower you can really appreciate its beauty from this vantage point."

It was an oasis of silence in the middle of noisy crazy Istanbul (it's actually very close to the grand bazaar, so you can visit it before or after the shopping).Another thing: In front of Istanbul University, there's Beyazit Square. In the evening it's full of people selling stuff on blanckets on the ground and street venders that squeeze fresh orange juice in front of you at 1 TL a glass.

Everyone wants to see the Blue Mosque and the Aya Sofya but I have to say that Suleymaniye is my favourite of the lot (that I say this after spending three weeks looking at mosques in Turkey). All the other mosques Sinan designed were just practice runs. This one is his best, I think. I saw it on a Sunday in late April and there was almost no one else there. I loved how simple it was on the inside with only the minimum of decor so you could really focus on the stunning architecture and the giant medallions. Go see all the other mosques and then come to this one last so you can really appreciate it."

It is architect Sinan's finest creation (and he was astonishingly fertile in imagination and skilled in execution) and it is appropriate that he is buried here along with Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent.The splendidly restrained and subtle purity of decoration in this 'White' mosque does show that sometimes 'less can be more'. Furthermore, it is the only complete ancient mosque complex to survive in Istanbul. There is a fine courtyard - the sahn - with a covered fountain. The former soup kitchen is now a pleasantly flower-bedded shaded courtyard restaurant. The menu, which is intended to present traditional Ottoman cuisine, was pleasingly varied and moderately price, but the tyranny of the clock prevented us staying for lunch, alas. Next time!"

It's closed to visitors at prayer times but if you get in before the prayer starts and just sit in a corner quietly, I'm sure you'd be okay I saw a few people doing this while we prayed. I think definetly worth doing this as you will get a much richer experience. I think the best time to do this is when you have a lot of ppl coming to pray as you will get a better experience. I noticed Fatih to have more ppl attend congregational prayers and I found the afternoon prayers to be the busiest. Women's areas are more empty and if your a woman and can get to the top (via stairwells at the back and some stairwells are accessible from outside towards the side and back) to watch the prayers I'd recommend that (just make sure your hair and body are completely covered and no shoes)."

The architect (Mimar) of this mosque was Sinan who had built 300+ mosques, colleges, palaces, bath houses and other Ottoman institutions during the rule of Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent and other Ottoman Rulers.We have visited The Suleymaniya several times during our visits to Istanbul (between1990 and 2012) but we were, more than ever thrilled, to see it cleaned and restored, looking fresh and very brilliant colors. This resulted in my taking lots of pictures of the exterior as well as the interior including nearby Daruzziyafe (part of the Social Complex), just outside the Mosque across the small lane, first time I photographed in 1994. It has been termed \"Ottoman Soup Kitcten\" which the Ottomans had established throughout the country. During our 1994 visit there was an excellent restaurant and we saw lots of historical items.I strongly recommend that you first cover from outside, take picture if you wish, stop by the Tomb of Suleyman the Magnificent and then enter the Mosque to really enjoy its interior, stop by Daruzziyafe before heading to nearby restaurants for a lunch or afternoon tea or ice cream."

We were able to sit on the ground and lay back looking up at the ornate structure of the ceiling. Not only was the inside beautiful and not crowded, but the Mosque was surrounded by a perimeter of lawn. It feels a little more secluded this way and makes wandering around the outside much easier and really enhances the visit.

Designed by the famous Ottoman architect Sinan, the Suleymaniye Mosque reflects fine Ottoman architecture and is known as the most striking and beautiful mosque in Istanbul. The Suleymaniye Mosque is away from the other historical attractions in the Old City that many visitors come to see in Istanbul so it is very much less crowded (and we hope it stays this way). The Suleymaniye Mosque is an excellent reprieve to anyone who visits anytime, worshipper or non-worshipper.Calmness and serenity were what I felt once inside the Suleymaniye Mosque. Standing there, all I wanted was to continue staring as long as possible at the beautiful ceiling while absorbing the peace and quiet of it all. Several visitors/non-worshippers sat on the carpeted floor while taking their time to appreciate just being there. Time stood still, that was what it felt like.On a relative note, the more popular Sultanahmet Mosque is an absolutely gorgeous mosque, though with the large crowd of visitors it draws also comes with a sense of rush. Go to both mosques for the architecture but experience the peace and quiet at the Suleymaniye Mosque."

My favorite mosque of the trip. Notice the numerous ostrich eggs in the chandeliers for bug repellent!

Another plus point is that on the walk up to the mosque, you end up walking through more local areas and you will pass some lovely (and also cheap!) shops!Something to remember- when you visit a mosque, make sure you are covered up. They do have spare scarves and fabric piece to put around your legs if you are wearing something shorter.

Pretty grounds, nice area, good views, and photographically rewarding to a degree, it just didn't do it for me. Not that much of a wow factor in my opinion.

In my opinion this is nicer than sultanahmet mosque. i think its more beatiful on the inside and it has less tourists there so its easier to get in and out without ques.there's a restroom there that u need to pay 1 tl to get in, it was clean and not too far from the mosque building, there's a nice park right outside and plenty of cafes and restaurants on the street opposite to the mosque. it was a walking distance from sultanahmet mosque and walked more to get to the ferry boat area where u can take a ferry ride to different destinations for 3 TL for one way. took several awesome pics of the mosque from the ferry boat."

At least 50 tourists form many different countries and cultures were sitting and attending this moment in total silence."

The Suleymaniye Mosque has something I hadn't seen with any other site visited in Istanbul (The Hagia Sohpia for example) yet- really great bathrooms. It might sound like a funny thing to appreciate, but when you're visiting crowded tourist destinations and you gotta go, it makes a difference when you find nice, clean restrooms. Asides from that, it would still be a must-see for anyone in Istanbul. It's right down the street from Istanbul University, so the roads leading to and from The Suleymaniye Mosque, particularly the road toward the Grand Bazaar, are easily accessible, quiet (which for Istanbul roads is saying something) and easy to navigate. I actually got to the Mosque right as prayer was beginning, didn't want to wait for it to finish- so I went in and did prayer. That's the first time I've ever done prayer, so I think I have some bragging rights. That's one of the cool things about the historic mosques of Istanbul- they're still mostly all functional as spiritual places and they're very peaceful and feel very comfortable."

Sinan didn't need immense quantities of blue tiles to make his mosque beautful.Our guide told us a story of how Sinan also engineered the building so that any smoke would be funneled out through one area; he apparently investigated by smoking a narghile (Turkish word for hookaH) while strolling about to confirm that the design was appropriate."

It is located near the Grand Bazaar; so it will not be much out of the way of most visitors.Why Suleymaniye Mosque? It was designed by Sinan, the preeminent architect of the time when the Ottomans first came to great power. He had a sense of space and vision that did not need elaborate decoration to create awe. The Mosque has recently been cleaned; so the contrasts between the predominantly light walls and the highly colored boundaries are striking. To me, the impacts of the overlapping shapes and lines were far greater here than at the Blue Mosque. Every different angle of view held new surprises.Most importantly, the Suleymaniye Mosque evoked a feeling of spiritual presence that was not at the Blue Mosque. This is in part due to the quality of the space, but also because it had only a small fraction of the number of visitors that were at the Blue Mosque"

He was a contemporary of Michaelangelo, and is an artist of similar rank. The Suleymaniye is absolutely gorgeous, and, being a little off the beaten track, is relatively tourist free - unlike the Blue Mosque.Sinan's Rustem Pasha Mosque is also a must with its exquisite Iznik tile decoration."

Not expensive and VERY authentic and delicious!Also, souvenirs in that area are cheaper that in down town Sultanahmet, so it would be a good chance for you.The last, thing, if you are a photograper, go away from the mosque in the direction where the souvenirs and cafes are, pass through the arch and the first building on the left is a student dormitory or some kind of student campus. You can go there and ask the students to go on the balcony and take an awesome picture of the mosque!! If you dare of course:)"

It is a very steep walk up hills (which can be a challenge in summer) but upon finding it the walk was completely forgottten. Its almost like finding an oasis in the middle of the city. Even on a hot summers day (it was 35 degrees celcius when we visited) there is a cool breeze blowing and the mosque has fantastic views out over the Golden Horn. The gardens are beautiful and the inside almost rivals the Blue Mosque. We actually found it to be more breathtaking and as we were one of very few visitors there was a real sense of calm and serenity in the mosque. There is some work going on so your can't walk all the way around the mosque but it really is worth a trip. You can also tie it into a visit to the Grand Bazaar and approach it from the other side of the hill."

He was a military genius and prolific architect. Go early to avoid crowds and plan on at least one half to one hour to view this masterpiece. Lovingly restored, its grand court, dome and side ornaments are worth close inspection. Mimar Sinan is buried in a modest tomb just outside the mosque's northeast wall; visit this tomb to pay your respects to a great man, then wander the back streets down to the Spice (Eqyptian) market and the Golden Horn. Each street has a speciality: tin and copper, porcelain, textiles etc. and is a shopper's dream. The mosque is a fairly easy 15 minute walk north from the tram stop in Beyazit (Lale University area); the walk is uphill, so plan accordingly."

The mosque itself was grandiose, and perched on top of a hill, very visible from the port and the bridge across the river. It is a working mosque, and has the typical \"foot-washing\" stations on the side, as well as in the (free) restrooms in the courtyard, where we were surprised to see a gorgeous marble-tiled version. The grounds were immense, and the structure was designed by a foremost architect. Very impressive! But our main intent was to see the resting place of the sultan and of his wife - Roksolana. The cemetery was closed, due to renovations and restoration work. However, we were stumbled upon the gorl in charge of the restoration work, and she pointed out the octogonal tower structures, that are the tombs of the two. The Library structure was particularly beautiful. There were nearly no people there when we visited, making it a good alternative to the Blue Mosque (if you want to avoid crowds). The area under the Mosque was also noteworthy - We walked down the hill, back towards the Spice Market and Port, to our ship. The walk down was also very interesting, seeing the local merchants, and the streets designated by the different types of materials that were sold (fabric, scarves, buttons, trim, cookware, etc.) And while walking across the bridge, we watched a hundred hopeful fishermen with LARGE fishingpoles (but saw noone actually catch any fish, despite traversing the bridge numerous times...) We look forward to visiting Istambul at greater length in the future!"

In order to facilitate visits by those not accustomed to the etiquette when visiting a mosque, headscarves and sarongs are provided free of charge so that customs can be observed and respect be shown. Unfortunately, once inside, too many visitors removed the headscarves and wandered around with it in their hands. I am not religious, but I was very disappointed at the lack of respect shown to the religion of those who kindly allow entry to their place of worship. This is perhaps just something to be aware of when planning your visit."

You can take the tram to the Beyazit (Grand Bazaar) stop. Or walk from Sultanahmet as we did.Facing the bazaar towards your left is the big gates of the University. On the left side of the gates you will see the sign for the Suleymaniye Mosque. Just walk up the road and the roads ends at the entrance to the Mosque."

Scarves and bag are provided to place your shoes in. Entrance is delayd 10 mins at prayer time, however the queues are large in the morning. Best time to go is 1400 onwards when the rush has moved on.Take time to sit somwhere and just admire the workmanship, architecture and sense of peace. the photos i have taken have come out wonderful. Highly recommend a visit here - read up on the history and catch good shots from most angles.There is a ladies secton gaurded by screens if you wish to say a prayer. So glad i visited this pleace took my breath away."

Partly because it is further away from the main tourist areas and partly because of the architecture this has a wonderful sense of calm and space. As in all historic Istanbul mosques, the detail is worth seeking out and taking time to appreciate: the stained-glass windows, the calligraphy on the walls, the beautiful tiles and the patterns on the carpets."

The architecture is perhaps a little more pleasing to the eye from the outside but the inside of the Blue Mosque is as beautiful as Suleymaniye. The Suleymaniye quibla wall is perhaps just a little more intricate and sophisticated in decoration. It is quite a long walk to get to from Sultanahmet (and quite easy to get lost). If you have limited time in Istanbul then you could just visit the Blue Mosque.Practical tips - there is a separate tourist entrance through the courtyard to the left of the main entrance. When there are prayers, there will be a sign put up and you cannot enter but it will indicate approximately how long prayers will last. You can wait either in this big courtyard or in the gardens at the front where there are lots of benches. On the left as you go in through the tourst entrance are head scarves that ladies can borrow for free."

The grounds and courtyard are lovely and peaceful. There were no tour buses, unlike the Aya Sophia or the Blue Mosque. The interior is simple in terms of design, but lovely to look at. There is a visitors entrance where you are provided with a plastic bag to place your shoes and carry them. Women must cover their head and shoulders and knees. Men must cover their knees, meaning no shorts. Please respect this as we did see a few people who did not. There are two sets of washrooms that are lovely and clean. One side you must pay one lira to use, the other is free. Not sure why the difference but the free one is outside the courtyard area on the northern side of the mosque.

One block was selling housewares, the next hardware, the next appliances, the next plumbing and so on. We turned up to the left (away from the Golden Horn) towards a great Mosque we could see up on the hill. After passing through an interesting neighborhood showing what appeared to be true Istanbul life of a certain kind, and after climbing rather steep hills - we arrived at what turned out to be the Suleymaniye Mosque. This was truly worth the effort. What a stunning place - I actually liked it better than the Blue Mosque. There were far fewer tourists here - so the experience was better. Upon exiting, we were hungry and enjoyed a nice meal at a restaurant just outside the exit/entrance. The north side of the Mosque courtyard offered sweeping views of the city and the Golden Horn. Make the trip here - it will be worth the time. Enjoy!"

The scope of the Mosque is such that, in the noon to afternoon sun, it looks more like a matte painting than a three dimensional object. The cafes that are outside of the mosque, though still with a view of it, are quiet and nice places to relax before heading down."

Hagia Sophia was built in the 6th century and Sinan made only smaller changes to Hagia Sophia in the 16th century. More or less Hagia Sophia is considered to be a masterpiece of architecture and therefor has become the role model of mosques built - also Suleymaniye (just for the wiseacre architect in me)"

The vaulted domes of S\u00fcleymaniye Camii are mind boggling and the courtyard for washing feet and hands is particularly lovely. This is a well used Mosque and so it is important to visit with reverence. Women should cover their heads and shoes need to me removed. I loved the rose, green, and gold colored domes and the incredible ornament of this place. It is especially lovely at night as it is entirely lit up and easy to see from the Karakoy or Galata side of the water. This mosque is truly a beauty."

It felt like an extremely long walk as it was all up hill (and freezing cold!) but it was worth the hike as we got to see panoramic views of the city on the sea. We later realised you can take a tram to Beyazit and the walk from there is much quicker as it is behind the Istanbul University. At some points we werent sure if we were going in the right direction as there are no signs anywhere!! However as we approached the top of the hill through very narrow lanes we saw a sign which indicated it was close by. The mosque is fascinating but it is important to know about the history for it to really have an impact on you. Otherwise it would just look like every other mosque in Istanbul. The tile work is beautiful and i could not help but constantly stare at the ceiling in awe. Women are required to cover their head and dress modestly as it is still an active place of worship and of course both men and women need to remove their shoes before entering however there are plastic bags outside that you can use to carry your shoes in. Best of all its free to visit and you probably only need 30 mins or so to see the entire mosque. It is closed to tourists during prayer times and you cant take any photos during these times."

There are FAR fewer tourists than at the blue mosque, so we felt that we got to enjoy the inside more. People seemed more respective here and were quiet inside and wore scarves on their heads. There were also no touts in the courtyard trying to sell us carpets - huge plus. The tiles inside are gorgeous and as I mentioned it is much more peaceful than the blue mosque. For those reasons I highly recommend visiting this mosque.There is also a good view of the new city from the outside grounds. We walked here from the ferry boat terminals and walked to the grand bazaar afterwards. The walks are definitely doable and we did not experience any hassle becuase there are less tourists in this area. There are free bathrooms on the side that exits towards the walled Istanbul University. Entry to the mosque is free and they give you bags for your shoes. It also looked like they had scarves to borrow for those ladies that forget to bring one."

Everything about the newly refurbished mosque speaks to a restrained, classical and simple but regal place of worship. The interiors, the well kept gardens and cemetery are beyond compare.

This is a HUGEmosque, similar in size to the Blue Mosque. I know it's not as famousas the Blue Mosque or Hagia Sophia, but I thought it was the prettiestof the three. The light pastel colors were simply breath-taking. Icannot tell you gorgeous this mosque is on the inside, it's simplySPECTACULAR. I did pray in this mosque and I felt special to do so.The attention to detail is amazing. There is so much work andcraftsmanship everywhere. This mosque looks brand new! It was restoredabsolutely perfectly. Visiting this mosque was one of the highlightsof my trip.This mosque is a little farther away and on a big hill, so it's a niceuphill walk. But because it is farther away, it is not crowded at all! It was practically empty when we went. I would not suggest taking acab either up or down this hill to get here because there is sooo muchtraffic, you'll just be sitting at a standstill while the meter runsup. We tried to take a cab back down, but the cabbie was honest andsaid it's not a good idea. When a cabbie turns you down for a big fareand tells you it's not worth it cause it will cost a lot, he's gottabe right!Anyways, the cemetary and tombs were closed when we went and so we hadto miss those. They had also closed off the section which would giveyou the best view of the city from the courtyard. However, thecourtyard is very pretty and it was nice and windy and just gorgeousto walk around in. Tip: the vendors outside the courtyard sell pashminascheaper than the Grand Bazaar does--so pick them up here. We foundthat similar pashminas were almost double at the bazaar."
