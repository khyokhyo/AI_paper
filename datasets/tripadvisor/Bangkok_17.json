I liked it's unique interior design that is like an airport terminal. On each level a famous city is represented with it's landjatks and special style. Paris, London, LA, Tokyo, Istanbul and more make a nice change to the same styled BKK shoping malls and travel around the world. Very easy to reach by Sky Train and MTR ASOKE Station. Nice range of cloths and fashion shops (international and local brands), nearly everything can be bought there + great eateries on each floor in a unique great decor.It's my favorite shoping mall in BKK!"

Yes, it's an interesting mall, with its own character, with one different theme per floor. Paris, London, San Francisco, Hollywood ...I'm sure it's a gem for girls. There are a lot of eating options, including a branch of Michelin-starred Tim Ho Wan (a dim sum restaurant in Hong Kong where it's almost impossible to find a table ...). I had dinner at Piri Piri chicken, which was good enough before a movie at the cinema on top floor, very comfortable btw.Pleasantly surprised by the visit of this mall."

Turns out they have heaps of market stall type clothes shops, fabulous restaurant range (predominately chains, but not the American ones) and some fashion areas. Tech shop was wedged on top floor behind cinema and was tiny and useless for what I wanted. All that said, it was a cool place to walk around and get easily lost in. The lifts do not go to every floor, making it entertaining and if you are not careful and get on the wrong escalator, you will end up 2 floors below/above your targeted floor... Otherwise a fun and friendly, and well lit, clean hopping mall. Also (from the outside) what looked like a very nice cinema!"

Terminal 21 sounds like a wharf where ships are, it is actually a very upmarket shopping centre, even if you have spent all your money and shopped out this shopping centre is a place you need to go and see while you are in Bangkok and take your time looking around, as every floor is in a different style, one floor has a Japanese appearance, another is like Istanbul, and another like San Francisco, and yet another is in the London style, there are so many different themes in the shopping centre from the lower ground floor all the way to the top, you should also read the signs as they are different.The lower ground floor has a very good food court as well as many shops and a lighthouse,on the next level you will find coffee shops. When they have a sale the prices are very good and worth looking around as my partner has bought some lovely brand name cloths and shoes as all are original no copies in Terminal 21.It is very easy to get to Terminal 21, if you are using the BTS Sky train then go to Asok and walk straight into the centre from the station, if you are using the MRT then go to Sukhumvit station and as you come up on the escalator you will see Terminal 21 on your right hand side and you can walk straight in.You should go to each floor as you will find something different there to take photos of and do some shopping, you will need to allow yourself plenty of time to walk around if you wish to see everything."

The mall itself is located very ideally; linked to BTS and MRT. Not hard for parking if drive there as well. The mall design is pretty unique with the theme of an airport terminal, and different cities on every floor such as Istanbul and London with its fitting decoration.But my favorite is the food court. You can find the tasty 'Phad Thai' and 'Hoy Thod', fruit juices here at a fraction lower than even the street hawkers. Shopping wise, it has those small labels and some big names such as H&M for a decent shopping experience. If it is not enough, you can always hop on the BTS to the other malls along the BTS stations."

If you do not like to spend that much money go to the food court at 5th floor and enjoy fresh mangoes with sticky rice for very little money. The freshly squeezed and very healthy drinks are inexpensive and taste of course great. Bangkok is the shopping destination number one there is no doubt anymore."

The mall has a Italian theme more like the Venetian casino in Las Vegas, most of the international brands have outlets in the mall and the prices are reasonable in fact I bought a shirt from H&M which was cheaper than the outlet in Madrid and the selections were also good. There was a on line market where I bought a designer watch for 2000 Bhat. Some of the British brands were on specials with around 50% off. The place is absolutely spotless including the toilets and there is a food court and a supermarket at the ground floor and if you go to the supermarket don't forget to try out the various freshly squeezed fruit juices and finally there's are places to sit until your better half finishes her shopping."

This mall has many stores selling everything from designer clothing, electronics, toys, etc.... They even have a market on the ground floor too. Each floor/level of this mall has a theme to it from major cities around the world, for example Rome, Istanbul, San Francisco, etc. There's also a ton of places where you can take pics to show how you traveled around at Terminal 21. The best part about it was their awesome food court, they have so many choices of food that you can choose from, its overwhelming lol. And the best thing is that it's so incredibly cheap, not only that every dish that I had from each vendor was incredibly orgasmically delicious. Most plates run anywhere from $1 - $2. That's so unfathomable!!! Now one thing for sure, their food court system is different what you do is you first have to go buy a gift card type thing from a kiosk in whatever amount you want & then you just go get your food & pay with your card. And each food vendor will give you a receipt telling you how much you have left. Now one thing for sure is that card is only good for one day, but the great thing is that if you still have a balance on that card you can take it right back & receive the remaining balance back in cash. So I think it's a pretty awesome system. This mall also has a movie theater on the top floor that plays the latest movie hits in English too. So this mall is pretty awesome if you ask me, it's also very easy to get to it by the BTS train (since the train stops directly in front of the mall)."

The food court here is clean, tidy and especiall cheaper but yummier than the food court at Platinum mall. The location is easy to access by taxi( of course), Buses and Train. The Asok right in front. On the way go to the terminal 21, we caught a bus number 2 in front of Big C and its a free bus, old but still nice to go by bus."

It is very convenient on the Skytrain and the shopping is quirky. But we would go back again just for the food. You purchase a card with which you buy the food from the numerous food stalls. If you don't use all your credit, you get it refunded and you can always top up. So it means the stall holders don't need to worry about handling cash etc, so service is nice and quick. The variety and quality of the food was amazing. We just kept eating & eating. Plenty for the kids as well. Will definitely be returning."

Do read the instruction on the back of the toilet door carefully so as not to press the wrong button. For example, the Tokyo floor toilet has bamboo pipes for their taps. The London floor toilet has a subway train and signages. Loved it! While you are there, do check out their food court at level 5. After a sumptuous meal, you might wanna head over to Instagram worthy cafe such as \"After You\" or \"Mr Jones Orphanage\". If you feel like having Thai Iced Tea, head over to the basement where their supermarket is. Right outside the supermarket check out counter is a Thai Iced Tea shop where they sell both Thai Iced tea drink and the leaves, which comes in little tins. My Favourite is Thai Iced Green Tea. Jasmine tea with milk. It's less sweet than the normal Thai iced tea. I think it cost around 40 baht for a large drink. There's only one size.

The food halls at Siam Paragon are way better"

I noticed that there were more tourists than locals when I visited.Each floor is named after a different place, such as Tokyo and Istanbul. Very interesting concept, and each floor is decorated with the specific \"attractions\" as well, such as statues of Sumo and Geisha on the Tokyo floor, creating lots of photo ops!Big international brand names such as H&M are available here. Local brands can also be found. However, do not expect to find bargains here, as this is a big mall.Incredible choice of food available here. The 5th floor is home to most of these restaurants and a large food court serving both Thai and international cuisine. You can probably spend half day exploring this mall and just window shopping due to the size of this mall.The toilets are also very clean, and the cleaners remind you (in English) to make sure that you do not leave any belongings when you leave the washrooms. A nice touch!"

It's okay if you do not speak Thai as it is not necessary, you can simply point to what you would like and then hand over the card.

However, starting with the Tokyo level, you start getting some really cool local businesses with cool, hip stores selling unique items you'll be hard-pressed to find elsewhere. It's definitely a step up from JJ Mall or MBK Center. It reminds me a bit of the old Suan Lum Night Bazaar, a place with low rental rates where young, creative designers and artists could sell their wares part time, leading to some really unique items."

This mall has a fun concept and it's worth checking out even just to see the neat little themes on every floor, even if you don't care about shopping here. The bathrooms on each floor complete the theme too, although I didn't go to every bathroom on every floor (they all have nice, Japanese-style toilets though, complete with seat warmers). There are lots of recognizable clothing (and shoe) brands here - like H&M or whatnot, along with a lot of interesting local stuff. On the floor with menswear, there are a few shops that have some really nice, unique t-shirts I haven't really seen anywhere else in Thailand (I might have seen some knock-offs of the one store in MBK though). My boyfriend bought a whole bunch of shirts from a few different shops. It seems to be a lot of artist-type t-shirt shops where they're printing and designing their own shirts.I bought a really nice Thai silk dress from a boutique for about $60CAD. I can't remember the name of the shop, but literally every shop we went into the staff were incredibly helpful. I was trying a dress on in another shop, but I would have needed it altered; the guy working did everything in his power to try to get it altered the same day for me (we were leaving the next morning) but it didn't work out. One of the floors sells tons of gorgeous dresses, another floor is more just typical (but stylish) womenswear. One of the top floors (I think just below the food court) is mostly accessories, jewelry and cosmetics. There's an It's Skin store here if you're into K-beauty. The jewelry shops are all quite different, some are selling funky, cheaper stuff like you'd find in a store like Claire's, other stuff is more designer and higher end (but not like a Tiffany's high end, just more elegant stuff). Also lots of different bags and purses and stuff, and some more unique shoe stores.The food court didn't really win me over, I guess I'm kinda spoiled because I've been to a lot of different food courts in malls in large Asian cities and this one didn't seem any different or special. I like the Food Republic in Siam Center better as far as food courts in Bangkok go. Though we did end up trying the pizza cone place because it looked like something different and it ended up being really good.This is a really neat mall, but it does start closing up kinda early (some shops started closing as early as 8PM), so be aware of that if you want to spend a lot of time shopping. The food court isn't worth it alone though, but it is worth just seeing the unique themes (and bathrooms) on each floor."

I had an amazing and unique Thai lunch with a good friend. We had coffee at Starbucks after and saw stores and brands I have only been in the states! There were even airport signs all over the shopping center. The bathrooms were worth the trip! It's a very busy place. Lots of hustle and bustle but so easy to get in and out. Take the BTS. So simple! This is a spend the day place until your to tired to shop and eat!"

Imagine being on a full day tour that started at 7AM, in a bus full of strangers for 1.5 hours one way, and your child all of a sudden crying for the toilet with bad stomach cramps and no place to pull over. Then it hits you... Then your husband...DISASTER. Eat at the food court with caution."

The food court is terrific, which don't forget you need to get a card loaded with cash before you get food in the food court. The outside restaurants don't require a cash card, just your cash. If you want to go straight to the food, go up the largest escalator first and then one more floor up and you are in the food court. The series of escalator takes a while and the elevators are slow, plus the disabled/elderly need them more. The shopping here ranges from a variety of handmade goods to modern clothes and jewelry. This mall is popular for random exhibits, I've personally seen a sneaker show, motorcycle exhibit, and a condo exhibit. The themes don't match the goods so don't be fooled by them. They are just names of areas to help organie the mall. Good idea, but misleading. Hope this info helps. Its a great place to shop, eat, and people watch. It's always busy."

However, eating at a restaurant, they charge you 16-17% on VAT and \"foreign taxes\"...which should just be included in the VAT. Thus, they overcharge you quite a bit. My enjoyment of the mall took a pretty big hit when it become obvious how much of a moneygrab their stuff is. The taco place we ate at didn't even list on their menus that they did this.Other than that, though, if you're considering going here for the scenery or to see a very reasonably-priced 180-baht movie on the sixth floor, I absolutely recommend it. You can also get free wifi that lasts for a year if you go to the service desk on the Paris or Rome floor and show them your passport/driver's license. :)"

Since we were staying at Sheraton Grande Sukhumvit, we went there a few times as the hotel and Terminal 21 is connected by overhead bridge.The lower floors have the usual international chains. My favorite is 3F Istanbul Floor which has Thai brands such as Merimies bag, Kiss Me Doll scarf, a cosmetic shop near escalator selling a few shelves of Mistine products alongside with other brands, Beauty Cottage and Jelly Bunny.At the basement Caribbean floor, there is Taokaenoi Land, where I got my Pocky souvenir, Green Day crispy fruits, Tao Kae Noi seaweed and some other Thai snacks. Sometimes the pricing can be cheaper than Big C. There is also gourmet market and some other food stalls as well. Boots and Watson is a bit small so I prefer the ones at Times Square nearby.The higher floors are mostly restaurants and food court. Wide selection of food to suit the needs of all ages. Tourists can register at customer service at Paris floor at BTS level to get tourist card and a Tao Kae Noi seaweed. But do note that some privileges in the tourist card like free flipflop at Merimies and free cotton bag at Taokaenoi Land are not honored which can be quite frustrating especially when I faced the cashier who is quite rude at Taokaenoi Land on 21 Jun ard 1pm. Can also show passport for a free wifi ID and password that is valid for one year. Tourist spending above 3000 baht can get a Naraya pouch with Terminal 21 label. 1 pc per day.It's definitely a great mall for tourist and family!"

An interesting concept mall - an 'airport terminal' that has a different country theme on each floor. We went crazy exploting the toilets on each floor as we heard so much from friends about how it matches the country theme. We were not disappointed. My favourite was the traditional Japan toilet and London underground. Seriously. It looks like the train has arrived and you have to 'mind the gap'. Plenty to eat and shop. We hardly shopped. Just exploring the mall decor (and toilets!) was enough. We squeezed in a heavenly royal foot massage from an shop on the 6th floor (same floor as the movie theatre) and it was worth every baht. The whole family fell into restful snooze during the massage. The recliners we were sitting on was so soft and comfy it was like sleeping on a puffy cloud. Remember to schedule it in. They are busy but they take in reservations up to 10pm everyday. So don't miss out. We also caught a movie while at the mall. We were staying at the hotel next door so we took in a late movie. Everyone stood up to the Thai National Anthem before the start of each movie showing - a really unique Thai experience. There was a food fare at the main entrance of the mall the week we were there. So much macaroons & pies & desserts from small businesses was on show for purchase - too many to choose from - and Yakun (from Singapore) also had a booth there. The mall also boasted the tallest / longest escalator. The mall is a must do stop if you are at Bangkok."

Each of the several floors in this mall is themed to a different city around the globe, a nice unique approach to a mall, however the shop brands within the cities just don't match the city they're in, which makes it a bit random for me. London, for example, has a few objects placed around the mall floor to symbolise London, such as old fashioned red phone boxes or so called queens guards.However the actual stores are not British, nor are they selling things you buy specific to London.There are some international brands, mostly on the ground entry level but otherwise mostly small thai clothing shops within their randomly placed citiy streets.I estimate upto half of this mall is either food outlets or electronics and cinema. While it was the only mall i visited in bkk, i cannot imagine it represents the best place to shop, theyre surely must be better malls without the gimmicky theme in close proximity.It should be said the mall was very clean and tidy, it also had a tourist information map point which is useful."

We only visited their food court on 5 floor in which KFC offers Halal food and their cinema at 6 floor. On ground floor their are a lots of small eateries offering delicious cakes, muffins, ice creams and shakes. Overall a good mall to kill some spare time."

The mall has a nice concept where each of six seven floors each have an international feel - so for example, ground would be Italian, and second floor British and so on. But once the missus heads to the shopping I head straight to the food court in the basement, and partake exotic variety of snacks from sushi to rice puddings to all kinds of global cuisine.

The shopping center itself has a quirky design with each floor themed in line wiht an an international city (London, Instanbul, San Francisco...) and there is a very nice movie theater on the top floor that shows Hollywood (English language) movies if you are looking for a break from the city.

Local Thai designers showcasing their ware.According to a local, the owner wants authentic Thai street food in the food court (level 5), hence he charged low rental to the hawkers which translates into low food price. You can have chicken rice for 30 to 40 Baht.Cheap doesn't mean it is not good, the food is better than what we had in the food courts of Siam Paragon, Platinum Mall and street hawker.

The 5th floor food court (opens at 10AM) is the best deal for clean local style food. There are many stalls/vendors selling everything from fruit smoothies to Chinese soups to Thai dishes. Expect this food court to be always busy. You go to the cashier counter first and pre-load your card with whatever amount of money you wish. I found that 200 baht was more than enough for each person. Just go to whatever food stall that interest you and order. Present your card and the amount will be deducted from your pre-loaded card. I think they even have a KFC up there for those that are not inclined to eat Asian food. When finished with your meal/meals, just go back to the cashier counter and get back whatever amount that wasn't used. The other place I like is the 'Gourmet Market' in the basement. Here you will find quality items for sale from Thai Curry mixes to Thai candies/snacks for you to bring back as gifts from your trip to Bangkok. Everything is just a little pricey but the quality is tops. They even have a small deli/fresh fruit section for those that wish to take out a lunch. The location for Terminal 21 is at the crossroads of two public transportation systems. Asoke station on the BTS (elevated trains) or Sukhumvit station on the MRT (subways)."

They use cash cards to dine for sanitary reasons. This one is special because it actually has napkins and a nice area for drinking water... Just Bring your own bottle!

It's like eating Thai street food but in a hygienic environment! The food is so cheap like $1-2 USD per plate. The portions are quite small but it's great so you can try different food stalls. I highly the clam deep fried omelette, coconut ice cream, fruit smoothie, chinese roast duck stall, pork and egg stew dish, anything and everything! You pay at the cash counter and top up a card with any amount then give your card to the vendors as \"payment\". You can refund the full amount when you're done, no deposits or handling fees etc.There is also a Michelin star award winning dim sum called Tim Ho Wan and the food is delicious! Great way to try the award winning restaurant for an affordable price.The mall has free wifi when you show your passport to the information desk. It is also conveniently connected to Asoke BTS sky train."

That is, one of entry/exit gate of Asok station leads to Terminal 21 entry/exit with just 10 steps. As I stayed very close to this mall, visited the mall few times. The speciality of the mall is in each floor you will find one country/region specific food stalls plus shopping stores. Apart from this most items are sold and the prices are almost of the outside markets. Bargaining is available especially for mobile phones that are sold in open areas. In top of the mall, cinemas are there for entertainment."

But be careful while taking selfies. The floors are marked like airport arrival zones giving the journey a different feel. The food court on the 2nd last floor on top has great options where you charge money on cards and then choose from numerous choices including Indian ones. One floor further up houses a cineplex which hosts new English movies. Hindi options are not there. There are many speciality restaurants also. A grocery store and wine store is hosted at the basement. Try it. Will not be disappointed. Overall"

This is a little different to the normal malls as each floor is themed to a different location.There is a floor containing clothes shops themed as London with a red bus, underground station and street signs. Another floor has Roman statues for Italy and another has a light house for the Caribbean. The top 2 floors are themed as San Francisco complete with a mock up of the golden gate bridge and these contain the restaurants. We went to the top floor where there is a food court. First you go to the prepaid card counter where you decide how much you think you will spend and load the card with this amount. You then use this card at any of the various stalls selling mainly Thai and Chinese food. All the stalls looked clean and hygienic and most prepared the food freshly as you ordered. You then sit at any available table to eat your meal. Any money you do not spend is refunded when you return your card as you exit. You will struggle to spend \u00a310.00 here on meals for 2 people including deserts and coffees or soft drinks. Probably not the best food available in Bangkok but the meals we had were very tasty and good quality/value for the cost. We would recommend the food court if you are in the area. The Mall is worth a quick look around for the themed areas but the shopping was similar to many other malls."

My visit Thailand in 2015 I missed Terminal 21 but when I revisited Bangkok 2016; nope I make it a point be it riots or bomb explosion. I never gonna missed it tis time. I heard from a friend T21 very interesting concept mall awesome place to shop with amazingly different themes at different storeys. Remember to check out the toilets follow the country's theme so exciting. Definitely worth my visit spending whole day from 10am to 5pm wandering in a maze of shops.Unlike Platimum Mall or Platimum Fashion Mall so overcrowded, here at T21 unclattered not just your regular Mahboonkrong; rather a creative mall like travelling thru' major city of the world Rome, Paris, London, Istanbul, San Francisco and Hollywood L.A. So accessible take a BTS to Asoke as you stepped out next to the station right before your eyes a massive mall with a unique theme awaiting to delight you with a great shopping experience. I'd rather let you see for yourself -seeing is believing explore a diversity of shops in a make believe city where in reality no way you can do it in a day. So enjoy also the longest escalator ride."

What I liked about it is that it has a unique \u201cAirport Theme\u201d to it, with each floor being labeled like an Airport Gateway to a city in other countries, like Paris, or London, or Istanbul, for example. They even show their promos on a screen made to look like a Flight Display Board. I also like the fact that they encourage people to sit around the mall with various benches and seats all around outside of the Food Court or Restaurants, unlike in our Malls. Overall it is a good mall with a lot of nice things, but if you are used to malls the size of Robinson\u2019s Galleria, or the SM Megamall, or SM Mall of Asia, you will find this mall to be a bit small, and a bit dim also, with not a lot of natural lighting.

Not only was Terminal 21 practical, it was also an experience in itself; every level had a theme based on popular worldwide cities (i.e. the San Francisco level incorporated the Golden Gate Bridge and featured a cable car / tram that was used for restaurant seating etc). Each level was made to feel as if you were boarding / disembarking through travel gates at an airport through their clever use of signage. It was a lot of fun, and actually quite spectacular.

There are cute little statues and other \u201cscenes\u201d scattered about the mall. This is a clean mall. It is well taken care of. The mall does have security guards at the entrances. There are multiple entrances and exits on multiple levels to include access to the BTS skytram. The point along the BTS route you would disembark to access this mall is the Asoke station.This mall does feature a very nice selection of restaurants and cafes from the somewhat high end all the way down to local fare for the store workers at a bargain price. The types of food served are US, all types of European, Thai, and Japanese sushi and curry such as Coco\u2019s. Coco\u2019s rocks! We have eaten at a number of venues here but will save these for another review."

It had a cute theme of an airport style as the escalators had signs above them with \"departing/arriving\" to a themed floor like \"Hollywood\" \"Paris\" etc..You do need to get a food court card like every other mall, but this one you deposited money which you will get full refund for what's left over ^^ enjoy! My friend and I ordered Pad-see-ew, korean dish, and some smoothies.I also came to this place to try the gelato place called \"stick house\" it was really delicious and I saw reviews so~SHOP: I found a cute sunglasses stand about level 4 near the escalators, and I fell in love with some of the designs. So I bought 3 cute sunglasses for about 10$ each (Buy 2 get 1 free). I wanted some for the summer, and I was planning to buy them in korea (head in about 2 weeks) but I remembered that the stores/streets sold them a bit pricey if they looked good. And, these in Terminal 21 were pretty good quality, so I'd rather spend here than searching out for some in Korea.I also went to the phone/tech area and added glass screen on my iphone with my friend for 7$ each. * we bargained by getting two, lowering the cost. I also wanted a power bank for my iphone and nothing too big with a good deal for 11$ on a slim small one and it didn't look cheap. *again bartered lower by going around~ Different stalls had different kinds, so best to look more.I decided not to buy clothes here although there are some great bargains for 150 baht range. And, the BTS station was connected to Terminal 21, but instead we walked the street to see the street market for tourist souvenirs which were cheaper than at Terminal 21."

It was a lot smaller then I expected and the only thing I enjoyed was the food. The 'fashion' side of the department store sold tacky clothing and I got the impression that most shopkeepers didn't want to be there. Started mentally counting the number of people i saw staring into space or playing on their phones ignoring people walking by. Tried to exchange money from various counters and all were rude and not very welcoming. Basically I wouldn't recommend this place if you just wanted to take a photo of the golden gate bridge."

The toilets on each floor are also themed to match the city, so it's fun to go and check them out. It doesn't hurt that they are spotlessly clean and have all the comforts you need in a loo :)There are plenty of cool little boutiques showcasing some young Thai designers, and it's not that expensive. I've bought t-shirts, jewellery, shoes, belts and scarves here at reasonable prices. It's way cheaper than the bigger malls, and it's also a lot more people friendly as you can chat to the designers/ store owners.There's a small gourmet mart in the basement, along with some amazing little food stalls. There's a whole range of restaurants upstairs, along with a cheap food court. You'll find coffee shops dotted around, but these tend to fill with people who bring their laptops and sit on them for hours on end.It's easy to get to T21, being accessible to both the Asok BTS and the Sukhumvit MRT stations. As with most malls in Bangkok, there is a cinema upstairs if you feel like catching a movie. It's a lot cheaper to see a movie here than it is back home."

The shopping complex itself has a great concept, with each floor given a particular city theme eg Paris, London, Tokyo, Rome, Istanbul etc. While it has some international brands however the main attraction for me is the boutiques that carries fashion from across Asia. Easy to get to via BTS Skytrain Asok Station."

First we waited near the shelves looking for someone to help us with sizes for my daughter for 10 minutes. There were at least 3 attendants milling about who avoided us. I approached one of them eventually and asked for them to bring out the correct sized shoe to which he stared back at me and did not respond. Eventually some other sales attendant came around and stated there was 10 minutes to closing time and when I told him that I would like my daughter to try a pair he simply stated no, \"10 minutes closing, no show shoes...\" There were at least 4 other customers being shown shoes (2 white, 2 thai). Taking this up with the manager was equally useless because the response was \"ok take shoes you want\" as if they were doing us a favour but still not prepared to apologize or show us correct shoe sizes. The store is RACIST and PREJUDICED! I will take my money elsewhere, no shortage of shops in Bangkok. I would not even give them the 1 star lowest rating."

Each floor has its own theme ,and the theme being a different country on each floor, I wont give to much away as it might spoil it for you if you go. Terminal 21 was also where we had lunch at Fuji restaurant as we had sushi in mind.

You can't pay with cash you have to get a card you load up with cash at the 'cashier' and get a refund for the balance remaining after you've eaten- Fantastic spa on level 6 - Let's Relax. Had an amazing back massage. It's a bit pricey, but the spa ambience and quality is what you pay for.- Good mix of shops mid-range (something for each price range) but if you want luxury goods, you're better off going to Siam ParagonYou can also catch the BTS to Asok Station, which is joined by skybridge to Terminal 21. We didn't do very much shopping there, stores are quite Western. Mostly just to look around, and go back to the amazing foodcourt for lunch everyday."

Once they understand what you need they are very swift to assist. Bought from samsung ate at several restauraunts there and even got groceries every few days from the supermarket.

If you are looking for quality local-label clothes and accessories, this mall hits the sweet spot. Be sure to bargain, you will normally be given a further discount. Yes, the price here is mid-range but affordable. And you get good designs and quality (and changing rooms). As the adage goes \"you really get what you pay for\".Need a break from shopping?

It is set on various levels each of which is themed to a different country. The shops vary in price, quality and uniqueness but most of the levels are worth a browse. What you must not miss, is the food court on level five. Various people told us that this is the most economical food court in Bangkok and we can well believe it. We had a Thai green curry and rice for 35 Bhat (the equivalent of about 70p). The choice is excellent and the food almost universally very good. There is a really relaxed atmosphere and a convenient payment system, whereby you load money onto a prepaid card which you then use in all of the different outlets to purchase your food and drink. The money is then refundable when you hand in your card if you haven't spent the entire balance. The different stalls all have pictures of their different dishes and the pictures are numbered for easy ordering. The food is either pre-prepared and ready or takes seconds to make whilst you wait. This is also a really good place to try the Thai national dessert of sticky rice and mango \u2013 delicious!"

I wanted to check out the various world cities (London, Istanbul, Rome, and several California cities) concepts on each floor and their restrooms. The London floor has the Underground and Red Bus, Istanbul had the hanging lights, Rome had the fountain restrooms, California had \u2018Oscar\u2019, Movie scenes, Walk of Fame and San Francisco had their cable car, Golden Gate Bridge and more.All of these scenes depicted on the floors with many high-end shops and food establishments. Our first visit we had some food on the lowest level and it was not until a few days later we found ourselves on the top level at the back and found a huge food court. Mostly locals and fewer western visitors here. We were surprised at how cheap the food selections were at this food court. Most items were about 1/3 the cost of meals we had at the Siam Paragon. The selections of eateries, drinks and snack shops were most watering. Purchase your dining card (good for several months) and head to your desired eatery. We sampled several Thai dishes and mango & sticky rice and they were delicious and cheap! This mall is a fun location to see how they set up the city floor designs (arrivals and departures) and a really delicious food court. Not to be missed!"

Each floor is a theme and it is a great place to kill time before a movie. The top floor offers a knowledgeable staff if you need a sim card while you visit. The bottom floor offers a bunch of food vendors...one in particular is the street food vendor. He offers most of Thailand's street food in a cleaner and safer setting. There is also a fried squid vendor that offers fried squid with three different flavors. Grab one and a tea slushie, sit at the fountain and watch people before you leave. Makes a great relaxing lazy day."

We mainly stuck to the basement where food places are (only to realise there's more on the top floor!).I'd be wary as some places did have cockroaches but it's hard where they thrive in such a warm country.There are plenty of shops, there was a special denim event when we went so there was even more pop stalls everywhere.There are also currency exchanges, I'd avoid the dour faced one on ground level.Even the information desk ladies were dressed like air stewardesses which is a fantastic touch."

It was so awesome! We found began shoes, great cheap tees and shirts and even a few presents along the way. We have been to MBK which we hated and Central Embassy which was amazing for high end fashion- very high end. Terminal 21 is super easy to get to by sky rail and you get off at Asok station and walk inside from tents. Soooooo easy and the ambience is fabulous inside this shopping centre. Every level is set out as a different city of the world and the clothing and stuff to buy is all set according to that city style. Really clever!"

The mall is quite large with lots of shopping and eating to be had. I love that each floor is themed in a unique city. One thing I particularly love about this mall is that you will find lots of smaller, sole owner shops here. I thought that was really cool and when you are buying something like clothes, you are often buying them from the person who designed and created them. When was the last time you walked into a clothes store and had that happen???The San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge going across the top floor is an awesome touch. (I might be a little biased as I am from the Bay Area) :)Overall.. one of my top two favorite malls when visiting Bangkok."

Yes there are the normal stores like H&M and Gap, but if you go up to the higher floors there are loads of little boutique and independent shops selling really unique things at good prices. We particularly liked the London and Istanbul floors. It also doesn't feel too big - CentralWorld is almost too big to manage, as you feel like you are missing so much of it. Terminal 21 isn't small by any standards, but it definitely feels like you get more out of a visit, particularly if you only have an afternoon or few hours spare. The design is also fun with the different themed levels, which helps it stands out a bit from some of the other, more bland malls in Bangkok!"

However, i will recommend a shop if you want to get wedding dresses as it cost about SGD500 to get a very decent, well design and pretty dress.The mall also have a food court at the top level and you are required to purchase a card at the counter before buying food. You can refund the excess money in the card from the same counter. The food at the food court is mediocre but cheap. A plate of pad thai cost only 50baht (SGD: $2). There are many restaurant to choose from if you are not eating from the food court. There is a small supermarket at the lowest level the mall as well as a cinema.A place that I will visit only if my hotel is nearby."

There were a few clothing shops that does promotion sales, I am not sure was it because of the season or occasionally there were. However, at the bottom level, there was the Gourmet Market which I feel is probably one of the more attractive and worthwhile because it sold a variety of foods from different countries at a reasonable price, especially the Thai food. There was also one or two shops that sells books where you can buy postcards and stamp. I have to admit tho, I did not venture all levels of the shopping mall, just mainly the bottom level.

There is a French floor, a Caribbean floor, 2 American floors, a Japanese floor, an Italian floor and of course: A London floor. For our non English readers I need to let you know something, there is no England outside of London, it's a myth, we all wear paddy hats and drive around in big red busses saying \"G'day Guvna', 'ows the missus?\" whilst slurping from our tea Thermos. It's jolly good fun.After wandering aimlessly like a travelling couple on a budget trying to kill time we got hungry. The only food in our price range was a simulated food highstreet in the top floor with THE MOST NEEDLESSLY CONVOLUTED PAYMENT SYSTEM IN THE WHOLE WORLD! We ordered 2 rice meals with pork and duck which was uninspired to say the very very least, it is the blandest dinner which wasn't helped by the fact that it was cold by the time we ate it due to all of the running around, they wouldn't let us pay with cash as we were supposed to have coupon cards from a reception terminal at the other side of the floor, we gave them cash and they gave us a card which we took back to them and they had to wait a minute to register the payment, all the while our poor excuse for a meal was just sitting there.If you have money to waste go to the mall and eat the expensive food, the cheap food benefits nobody."

Every floor as a theme of a country, and I'm from the San Francisco area, so I have to say they did an amazing job of the San Francisco floor of the mall. Even all the restrooms have themes, and there is a restroom on every floor. The 5th floor behind the Golden Gate bridge had a great food court with street food prices. The bottom floor also has a grocery store. However there is no cinema or bar here. Terminal 21 is located next to the train station as well. Sukhumvit for MRT, Asoke for BTS."

I picked up a few local designer dresses and blouse at very reasonable price. One of them is Graffe. I also ventured to the jewelery and bags floor. Love the brand - Flow founded by Thai designer Ms Valaipan Chupan. If you are looking for evening gowns, this is also a place you can find a couple of shop specialised in these. Designs can be simple with details or complicated with sequins, crystals and beads. I think they do alterations for those who are willing to wait. Some of them are made of quality Thai silks gown with striking royal colours like purple and gold. A must go for those who like to look at local design. It is a young and trendy mall to be as i saw students in uniform, locals as well as tourists visiting this mall. The other part that is impressive is the variety of cafe and restaurants.

Other reviewers have already praised this place, but I'll add my perspective - as a guy just walking around looking for a new place to explore, with no desire for shopping, and not fond of inside mall environments. The location is walkable from much of Sukhumvit and right off the platform of the Asoke BTS stop.My first impression walking inside was Wow! This place is really impressive. The complex is built around a large atrium that's 7 floors open. Inside this open area are numerous escalators shuttling people around like a future sci-fi city movie. Really, the long one from the bottom is truely the neatest escalator I've ever seen. Riding up, I was looking around like a country boy visiting the city for the first time, gawking at the immensity of the place.Each floor has glass walls and low rails protecting the atrium edge, but still allowing one to lean over, look down, and be equally scared and impressed with the exposure and open view. Besides the numerous international stores, local table shops, floor themes, art decor, and nice bathrooms on each floor, there's a multitude of outdoor cafe/eating/sitting areas that offer atrium edge views. Whether people watching or web surfing, a person could really spend a lot of time in these areas. There's free wifi throughout the mall, but one has to register with an email address the first time logging on - at a desk somewhere I didn't investigate.It took me awhile to understand the airport gate, country destination, floor setup. But once figured out, I'll admit that it's unique and clever. There's logic in grouping similar types of stores on each floor - ie, tec all on one floor. Since I wasn't intentionaly shopping, I can't detail the pattern except to say that the movie theatre was on the top (7th floor). I'm sure it's first class.With diverse shopping, numerous places to eat, and a cool (entertaining) environment, I'd recommend a visit to this place as a great recreational activity for most anyone - even a guy who doesn't care much for malls or shopping."

            "review": "Phenomenal experience - shopping, food, or simply sight-seeing. By far the best shopping mall i've ever been to. The primary reason for you to go is none other than the clever designs of different landmarks or designs of a particular city, which varies on every different floor. As you can see from the photo, the famous Sans Francisco Bridge (no idea what's the actual name..sorry!). There's designs from cities like London (even the guards on that floor dressed in the British royal guards uniform), China, Japan, Istanbul and Rome. Being a vegetarian, i find this mall very helpful as the food court on the 4th or 5th floor called the Pier 21 offers a wide range of food, including a vegetarian rice/noodle stall. 40 Baht for 3 dishes if not mistaken, was indeed a great value judging by the price and the portion of rice and dishes the staff gave us.Bottomline, don't hesitate to visit Terminal 21 as it is easily accessible by taking the BTS to Asok station, which is pretty convenient to most of us.***P.S. I am posting this to every review i make for ThailandDO NOT, i repeat DO NOT go for UNMETERED-TAXI. They will tell you 'cannot...traffic jammmm' in their Thai accent and will persuade you to pay a certain amount of Baht instead of going by the meter, which will cause you more than it should be. The first night upon reaching the Don Mueang Airport we paid 300 Baht to the taxi driver outside of the airport (The ones inside the airport would cost even more) and on the last day we paid only 97 Baht by hiring a METERED-TAXI from the hotel lobby."

My husband (a man who is NOT a keen shopper) actually declared it one of the best shopping centres he's seen.Well laid out, the centre is themed around an airport with each floor a different \"destination\" (London, Paris, Rome, Tokyo, Istanbul etc) and each floor has similar stores so all menswear specialists are together, accessories, etc. while this probably isn't the home of the cheapest shops in Bangkok we enjoyed the variety and the fact that there were lots of small individual quirky boutiques, so not the same old thing. Worth a visit if you're in the area & make sure you check out the themed bathrooms as well!"

The food court had an interesting setup where one buys a food debit card in any amount and you buy your food using the card. Food stalls never handle money. On the perimeter of the court are higher end restaurants that take credit cards. Interesting was a couple of food stalls representing a couple of Michelin starred restaurants.Terminal 21 has a mix of small gift vendors and larger chains like H&M."

It is well organised that gives a shopper focus when one has some items in mind to buy. A lot of the Thai designers have converged here so one ends up with unique Thai finds one won't find in other shopping places.I stayed for about 3 hours and told myself to leave before I get buried under the shopping bags I'm bewildered to have with me then.Happy shopping!"

While the centre is stunning with each floor being decorated to look like a specific city; we found the shop owners to be quite rude and disinterested in customers. This was not a a specific shop, but rather a general attitude. We hope were also very pricey when compared to other places in Bangkok selling the exact same items. We had been at Asiatique Riverfront the previous night and saw many, many of the same items at much better prices- the experience there was also much better.

The elevators and escalators also make you feel you are at the airport.Each floor has a country/main city as theme, for example Paris, Istanbul, Japan, or SF. The decoration, the toilets, and even the security/cleaning personnel have different uniforms depending on the floor!There's also a good foodcourt, where we ate the cheapest food in Thailand (we didn't try street food as the hygiene is very questionable there). We went with a local and he told us that no other mall had such cheap foodcourt.In all, if you are living nearby (Asok Station) and have some time to spare, you can amuse yourself here. There's even a small treasure hunt available. You get an information paper at the information desks and collect 3 stamps on the back of this paper in different floors, and then return it to get a souvenir.

There's also a Citi-Bank located here with a security guard and so I used this location for atm stops"

It conveniently located and a lot of fun working your way through the myriad of little stalls on the upper floors.However, my favourite part was the food court next to the obligatory supermarket. There was a good variety of food selections including Japanese, Thai and Viet. My favourite was the Thai crispy pork and duck. Delicious duck and pork served either on rice or with noodles...it was yum. For those with a sweet tooth, ther are a variety of bakeries as one would expect but there were two that caught the eye. One serving beautiful eclairs and cakes, whilst another served a variety of mini-pies. Of course there were the usual Japanese / French bakeries to fill the void.Have a wander and enjoy. It isn't as massive or glitzy as Paragon but that was a good thing."

Should have come here sooner!! Loved the different levels with different retail items for sale. My fave would have been Istanbul level 3 - so many gorgeous small shops filled with jewellery & accessories - unique compared to the offerings see. At other malls. Both costume & with real stones & precious metal. Will definitely return to spend a bit more time exploring! The mens fashion level (forget which that was now) also had excellent quality & unusual t shirts & shirts."

Possibly my 2nd or 3rd time coming by and it probably has all you need less the crowds. Interestingly themed like an airport with various major cities on each floor of the mall and even info counter gals like air-stewardesses! This time round, I again came to a must drop by shop of local Thai snacks at the basement. Some of you may know Tow Kae Noi, the famous seaweed shop set up by a young local guy with even a film of him to boot. Plus, myself and a friend had a really cute popsicle each of plentiful flavours available, we had a hard time making up our minds! Finally, there's a really good Thai tea shop at the basement food counters. It has a prominent thumbs up for its brand logo and you couldn't go wrong with it. Oh yes, not forgetting the plethora of popcorn at a food counter with the weirdest and most novel flavours one could imagine. Durian popcorn anyone?"

And when u have had enough , you can go to the top level & catch a movie & rest those feet for a while. The best way to start is to take the lift to the top. That way u can check movie timings. And then use the escalator down to each level & explore all the way down to the basement where there are more restaurants & a big supermarket."

I got a duster from one designer that was a bit pricy but the kind of thing I will do only if I know I'm going to get some good use out of it and the quality is good. Love it! Many other shops are very reasonable. Good place for unique items for yourself, gifts, jewelry, and do visit the Pier 21 food court. ( I think 5th floor) . You can buy a card where you put money on it, shop at any food stand and they refund you the difference when you leave. Or just keep it for your next visit.

Everyone says about its interior but I want to say that even though this mall's not that big on some of the floors there are very good and not expensive clothes compared to other malls in Bangkok (I visited most of them with my wife). I liked London most of them - a lot of unusual stuff of good quality. Of course sometimes they don't have your size of clothes and shoes but still - compared to price/quality it's 5 stars. On Tokyo floor you can even find a shop of really old clothes - old school, baby!"

I really liked the idea of this place, with each floor having a different country based theme but I found the stalls to be a bit repetitive and I didn't find anything unique about the place. We stopped for food, which was tasty but over priced for what we had. It's worth a visit on a dull day but I wouldn't rush back!"

I guess if it makes the place different and attracts more tourist customers, then it does.There's no shortage of shops of massive variety, restaurants etc and the decor is very western. The prices are very western too. If you're looking for someplace traditionally Thai and Asian, then this isn't the one. If you're after a mall just like back home, then you'll be happy."

Although the mall has a great theme (each floor represents a city or country), it's not enough to write home about. The mall is not large. We should have taken it as a hint when the taxi driver asked us if we were going to Terminal 21 because we were looking for something specific. The mall was very nice (cool restrooms, nice construction) and the stores sold higher quality items. But this felt like a typical United States mall except with a theme. Not a unique experience."

He even talked to the taxi driver through the front passenger window. We went into the yellow and green taxi with fake meter. The meter started at 162.4 and never move during the journey. He said there is peak hour charge. When we reached destination opposite Platinum Fashion Mall, he pressed meter and it showed 540 baht. We said we did not have enough money as we knew it was a scam. We tried to open the doors but both back doors were locked. One of us forced open the lock and we escaped. We paid him 300 baht after running out. Can Terminal 21 try to find this fake taxi? 8 Aug 2015 and time is 6.10 pm to 6.20 pm. The security guard may have worked with this taxi driver to cheat tourists. I saw him recording every tourist destination. He may have taken down the number plate, starting with 6611."

I know some people seem to be whining about this and that regarding Terminal 21, but it's a huge shopping centre and like any mall in the UK you'll find familiar names amongst those you've never seen and probably won't ever again. The airport concept is great with themed floors and certainly makes things a bit more interesting above anonymous floors found in other shopping centres around the world. There's a really good food court with loads of choice up towards the top of the centre and you're pretty spoilt for choice for things to try. Location-wise, let's face it, you're probably gonna be probably passing by this area so it's worth spending 30 minutes having a wander round, even if it's just to ride the massive escalator. If you don't like commercial shopping centres though as some of the other reviewers appear not to, I'm unsure why you would come here. "

I left my wife there, and she returned empty handed many hours later, pretty bummed at how useless the upper levels proved to be.On the food front, there's plenty to choose from. But that's no reason to waste the day in Terminal 21 instead of Central World.(Only reason we might visit again is because we usually stay on Soi 15, and you pretty much have to enter/leave via Soi 19.)"

My husband was in an ankle cast so we were not looking fir a very active holiday but the kids needed their entertainment. And i needed to SHOP !. So this place was so ideal for us we had connecting rooms , which were more than well equipped , a very interesting view of bangkok streets lit colourfully at night. The hotel is in the sukhumvit area near ashoka station so one can walk just out into the streets and ur in middle of the action . Shops restaurants malls the works. The best part is that Terminal 21 is hotel on oneside attached to a huge amazing mall which one can access straight from the lobby !! Its a 6 storey mall with 2 big food courts aside from restaurants. Each floor is dedicated to country like turkey london and so on . The whole atmosphere is very festive and happy . Thetes entertainment for all ages so my husband was chilling in the room without a care while me and kids were alll over t mall. As we were rite inside the hotel building he wasnt worried bout us getting lost. The kids went off by themselves everywhere as tge hotel had provided us cards to reenter from mall. Evenings would find the 4 of us walking to nearby restaurants. I would definitely refer people to stay here as our check in and checkout was carried very efficiently and pleasantly by the hotel staff. All in all a very happy experience."

When you visit Terminal 21, you must patronize the rest rooms on every floor as it is uniquely designed to follow the theme on each floor. The shopping mall has all the local Thai designers and if you love shopping this is a place to find local designer stuff. Also must try the coconut ice cream sold in the food court on the uppermost floor."

First, it differs from other large shopping malls in the fact that it has both brand name stores you can find in the U.S. as well as private shops for people who want something special from Thailand. Also, each of the 6 floors is designed after a different place in the world-my favorite was the replica of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco on the 5th floor! (See pictures). Another thing I loved about terminal 21 was the food court, everything was extremely cheap! For 150 baht my family got 2 ice cream cones, a bowl of traditional Thai dessert, a plate of thai noodles with vegetables, and an order of tom yum noodles. If you're in the area, it's worth a visit-you don't have to spend any money and you'll get some very cool pictures out of the trip."

It has a very large variety of food to choose from, and the prices are very low, at least for ice cream. I got one scoop of ice cream for 10 Baht, which is approximately 30 cents. Terminal 21 uses a system where you put money into a voucher-type card, then use the card to purchase food items. After you are done, you are reimbursed in cash. I originally thought the system was unusual, but it makes sense because checkout is a lot faster. Terminal 21 is a shopping mall with a popular, low-price food court."

Reason behind this is because we had to transfer from the Sukhumvit MRT with the Asoke BTS. On the first visit, we found it to be an interesting themed shopping centre based on various cities in the world as well as terminal gates at the entrance/exit to the escalators. However the problem with fixed theme attractions are it will only interest most during the 1st visit. The reason we went back was because of the food court at the top level. The food is delicious with good value. Some are even marginally cheaper than the street side vendors. Most food courts in Thailand works on a pre-paid card system and Terminal 21 is no different. Do not be worried of over budgeting your card as you are entitled to a refund on the remaining value of the card once you're done. Shopping wise, there are some international chains such as H&M and also some local designers. Price wise it is definitely more expensive than the usual suspects (i.e: MBK, Pratunam, etc..)"

The shops on the lower floors are larger international brands. On the higher floors there are more interesting smaller stalls, particularly on the 'London' floor. At the top is a cinema multiplex.

During the weekends and some weekdays they will have a function in their main level (Paris). When we went there it was all about confectionery and street food. They showcased lots of mini stalls offering different sweet delights! Of course, a sweet tooth like me went nuts for it! There were also plenty of cuisine to choose from on 4th and 5th floor which were both named San Francisco. If you love Japanese food, they have plenty here. Also the Istanbul level offers a different shopping experience. instead of brands it was like a small market stalls where you can buy stuff that can also be seen on night markets. Prices are more expensive than the actual ones in the markets of course. Also, they have the best public toilets as some floors offer Japanese toilets for your comfort. The top level which was Hollywood is where the cinema is. Cinema was a great experience as well. big spacious reclining seats on standard movie tickets was a plus.

So, rather than simply numbering each level you travel upwards to another city which is interesting and in each city you can do some different shopping. All of the prices are fixed so haggling is a waste of time but you can still get \"discount\" when bulk buying.Most of the label stores are available but you can still do souvenir and t-shirt shopping - it just costs a bit more than outside market prices.There is also food available and toilet(s) on each level. The Plaza is a/c which is a nice relief from the heat and humidity outside.Good experience and we had a bonus - a local production company was shooting a movie in and around the building which was entertaining!Great plaza and worth the walk from hotel."

Hoped to kill a few hours window shopping and then grab a bite to eat. The set up of the mall was very interesting and innovative, however I struggled to find any shops that was of much interest to myself and similarly all the restaurants were expensive (which was of no surprise). Settled for an ice cream and wandered down the road for some cheaper and probably equally as tasty Thai street food."

The shops are small and full of funky clothing and jewelry, so it's really fun to peruse and window shop. If you visit this mall you absolutely must visit the food court, Pier 21. You'll have to take the escalators all the way to the very top of the mall, but it is worth the trek. The food court has loads of tasty options for very affordable prices. The vendors don't take cash though. You have to buy a pre-loaded dining card at the desk which you can then use to pay for your meals. The food court can get pretty busy though. We went once on a Friday night and it was so busy we almost couldn't find a table."

Every floor has a international theme like Japan, Istanbul and San Francisco, and the decor (including the toilet) is unique to each destination. It is a modern and clean mall, so do not expect cheap bargains, and neither does it offer high-end brands. In the basement there is a gourmet supermarket (you can make your own salad), a couple of pharmacies (Boots and Watsons) and bookstores, as well as lots of take out food. The lower floors are devoted to international High Street brands (Promod, H&M, Adidas), which I ignored since I can find them in Singapore. But the upper floors are full of local designers which are much more interesting. The Japan floor caters to women's clothing, London more to hip male clothing, Istanbul has lots of accessories (shoes, bags, scarves, jewellery), Hollywood at the top has a movie theatre, video games, a spa (Let's Relax Spa - clean, professional and very popular). San Francisco is two floors of food, one with restaurants and cafes, and the other a food court offering a variety of local foods (noodles/rice/dessert/juices) at reasonable prices.

If you like the mid-way (not looking for high end brands, nor looking for the super cheap), but like independent local designers or small boutiques with bits and bobs for both men, women, children and all others (...ha!) - pay Terminal 21 a visit! You also have UPS and PostOffice at the very ground floor (take two stairs down from the main entrance on Sukhumvit Soi 19 side). It is rather cute even in it's grand size (it does not feel 'that' big). Great spacious clean public toilets with very funky modern toilet seats (you have to try them out! Haha). I personally love contemporary designers with some edge. I found a new fav brand in Black Sugar ! - mix of Japanese and Thai. LOVE ! Would never come across them if not walked past the small shop (learned they are also at Centralworld). I did find the Info board on each floor quite tricky to use (too technical for me maybe, not clear enough), however there is a live desk to ask for help if needed ;). It is a big place, lots of stores; clothing, cinema, technique, TeleCom, food, post office, supermarket, cafe's...feels modern and youthful. Even if I am more into high quality brands and high quality independent designers, I actually liked my visit - and will pay a visit as often I can. I do feel I like to really take time and browse carefully...as there are some gems to find. It is also nice to see there are shops for men only..and not only focus on female clothing or accessories.

We chose mangoes and sticky rice and iced Thai tea with milk every time and then our entrees would vary. The shops are fun, but a bit pricey.

The theme is very clever in that it resembles an airport terminal and as you ascend the escalators each floor has an arrival / departure gate depicting a City (Rome / Tokyo / London / New York) and that floor is meant to showcase fashion shops relevant to that location. From the reviews I expected better but it is rather tacky, I quite liked the London floor with big red buses and telephone box but that was it. The shops are all very low-end and I would say this mall is very much aimed at the late teens / early twenties age group with H&M and other floors containing shops equivalent to H&M but not as good if that makes sense. I am a stylish forty-something and work in the City of London, there was nothing here for me. I rather liked a shop on the Paris floor selling beautiful lemon scented home fragrance oils in containers but these were \u00a380 so I think I found the only expensive shop there! Needless to say, I didn't buy anything. All in all it was not for me but the kids would love it!"

Each floor has stuff from different countries including USA. Just a reminder that the items on sale are very expensive including the eateries/snacks/ice creams. I could only do some window shopping in most of the countries stalls, however, managed to find couple of items which were reasonable. IT equipment, networking areas, massage parlours are also in this location, also, games for seniors and youngster"

In complete contrast to some of the HUGE shopping malls in Bangkok this shopping mall, still massive by many standards, is so much easier to navigate around. It is easy to find too. Just a bit further along from the Robinsons department store, and very near to the Westin Hotel. I would get off the SkyTrain at Asoke station to get myself there. We needed some pretty diverse shopping from bedding to sport shorts, and presents to be sent back home, and to eat lunch if possible. All the stores were located with ease, and it was very simple to locate restaurants and coffee shops. All in all a surprisingly comfortable shopping trip, if such a thing can ever be called that!"

Its fame for many restaurants and food hall on the top floor at the back section of the building. The top floor front section is a cinema hall. At the food hall, you load a card with cash at the cashier desk for spending. When you buy food each time the seller will deduct the money from your card. What money is left if any you can get it back when you leave.The food hall is like a food market where there are many stalls selling different types of food. The prices are similar to street food but I found you get nothing much compare to restaurants in terrace buildings or street food.The main problem is that if you go at lunch time or a public holiday, the place is so busy that you will find it difficult to get a seat. Perhaps you could share a table with a stranger like street food but asking first and not sure if they really understand the request. Walking around trying to find a seat with food in your hand is not fun. Popular with Asian tours so could be really busy. I tried this place out twice, once on a very busy holiday and the second time late afternoon on an ordinary weekday which was easier to get a seat. That was enough for a laugh. You are better off go to any restaurant in there or any other shopping mall, after all restaurants in Thailand is relatively cheap anyway."

The restrooms are another feature, totally clean and designer, every floor is different, but all the toilet seats are fitted with electronically controlled squirters and dryers.You can take the Sky train to Asoke Station, and the skywalk exit will take you in at the second level.

The mall is connected to the Asok BTS station, making it quite accessible.Additional tips! (1) If you're looking for a good, clean spa, I would highly recommend Lavana Spa, situated along an alley opposite Terminal 21 (No. 4 Soi Sukhumvit 12). My wife and I have been there a few times since our first visit in 2011, and always leave satisfied. (2) Want a better Japanese restaurant than what is available at Terminal 2? Head to Kisso Japanese Restaurant at the Westin Grand Sukhumvit, for a delicious Japanese meal! :)"

Not only that but each store is designed in a beautiful, unique design.It is really abseloutly beatiful just to walk around the shopping center - everything is so colorful and special....Besides some big farmiliar names like H&M, Camel Active ect, there are many unique little stores, small designers selling amazing stuff.I highly recommand a visit to this shopping Center.If you take the BTS (sky train), you get off at ASOK station right into Terminal 21"

The shopping centre is themed like an airport with each floor (about 8 or 9 I think) being a different city for example, London, Paris, Rome and Tokyo. There is a really good variety of shops and restaurants and the food court was very busy. Also very easy to get to via BTS Skytrain and right next to Soi Cowboy if you want to go and have a drink and a laugh afterwards!"

Keep in mind that food portions in Thailand are not as big as in the USA if you are from America, so you might want to order more than just one entree.

To make the matters worse, she only remembered it after about two hours when we were on our way back. I called up on her no and the call was answered by a security personnel who informed me that the phone was found by a cleaning lady who handed it over to the security department. When I reached back to the mall, it took me just five minutes to retrieve my phone. Though a small incident, it speaks volumes about the administration and honesty.Thumps up guys!!

Terminal 21 in Bangkok is easy to get to right off the MRT with covered walkways...just follow the heard.Like most other reviews, yes, it's massive and yes, it's a concept mall - meaning, each floor represents a different city/culture - so to speak. The London floor, the Tokyo & the New York floor and so on. It's really a decorative thing that does make mall walking more fun but Terminal 21 is still a massive urban mall where most things can be found at typical mall prices...I saw no real deals to be had.The food stalls are pretty good, there's a wide range of eateries from all over the world, chain type of course, the cinemas on the 6th floor are well presented and clean.There's plenty of security and if you want free (NOT STARBUCKS) WiFi you have to go to the info desk, present ID, they scan it and then give you the login info...mmm...odd but whatever!If you're in town and wish to get outta the heat, Terminal 21 has all the right fixings for you."

Every imaginable shop you could think of, all clean, neat, and modern. The mall is I believe 9 stories high, and covers a good part of a city block, so there are many stores to vie for your attention. I am not a shopper by ilk, so a lot of the hoopla was wasted on me. We did spend a bit of time in the super market/food court in the lower level. Lots of offerings, at very reasonable prices.

I stayed away from the western goods and shopped entirely for local made products. Pricing was reasonable but no real bargaining. The floor layout was a bit odd to me at first but didn't take long to get a feel for the floor plan. Each floor is a different city/country destination but the shops themselves have little to do with these countries. Guess it is a way of not using boring floor numbers. There is also a movie theatre, large food court and various style restaurants if you are hungry. Food court had a large variety of types of foods. Mall was very busy, as are most malls in Bangkok, but place is relatively new and has been kept very clean. Restroom was one of the cleanest public facilities I have been in while in Thailand."

For instance London has a double decker bus and an old red telephone box which seems to be a favourite photo spot for tourists. I watched a number having their photos taken there the other day. There is a wide variety of shops and the prices are not too high. There are also a wide choice of restaurants and snack bars. I had a good Portuguese style chicken in Pili Pili Chicken the other day and there are many more to choose spread over all the floors with probably the most on the 5th floor.

It has a world class Cinema Complex at local prices, an exceptional food court, a myriad of mid level restaurants and the cleanest, most modern restrooms in the Kingdom.Whether it is for coffee, brunch, lunch, a casual dinner or endless shopping, Terminal 21 will generally satisfy.It has some restaurants that try to be high end and fail - I think they could be replaced with a cornerstone establishment or two catering to the dinner crowd but able to offer all day places for business meetings with a bistro feel. I say this because it has some great views from the upper levels that most visitors never see.It has a good range of mid level shops for mid level budgets. It does not try to be another high end emporium, nor should it.I suppose I come here three or five times a week when I am in town, sometimes more. You will enjoy it as a place to just 'get away'."

This mall has a few mainstream brand stores, but tons and tons of off brand, mom and pop shops with plenty of cool merchandise to peruse through. We spent most of our time on the Men's floor and walked out with two Japanese silk jackets with dragons and phoenixes on the back, some crazy print shoes, Magic decks, wacky tshirts and a pair of leather sandals for me. We enjoyed chocolate banana shakes and had korean bbq on one of the upper floors of the mall. We tried to get into the really busy locals bbq joint, but the hostess was extremely rude and the locals rudely pushed past us to get their reservation numbers. The one we did get into was great - steak and seafood on the grill in the table! (Think it was near the American restaurant). The locals there kept watching us and giggling because we were struggling with our food (lots of unknown condiments like kimchi and pickled eggs) and how to effectively handle 1/2lb. metal chopsticks without continually dropping them on the table and plates. The bottom floor was also all about food and had some very interesting restaurants - hot pots, teppanyaki, sushi - it all looked delicious."

The huge shopping mall is organized like an airplane terminal.Each floor is a different world destination as were the bathrooms. Every bathroom had a different motif, and many tourist including myself were taking pictures of the beautifully decorated and staffed bathrooms. It was so much fun going from floor to floor following the Chinese tourist taking photos of the bathroom. Each one was even more interesting then the last. after doing the bathroom run, we started at the top floor and worked our way down. They even have a movie theater in the mall. Some of the more interesting floors were San Francisco, London, China etc. They have a small replica of the Golden Gate Bridge spanning the center of the mall. You can take a great photo across the mall. Each floor had wonderful modern products and countless restaurants from all over the world. If you want a break from the spicy Thai food you will pleased to know that there were many chain food restaurants to select from. Terminal 21 is a must when visiting Bangkok."

The next is the public loo at each floor of the shopping complex, it just attracted you to make a visit to the toilets, wondering what is the decoration?. One of the family member even insist to come back to Terminal 21 when she was afar from the shopping complex for her biological business. The food court provided the Siamese food and others with many varieties. The ice cream with the steam boat deco is the most popular. The fruit deserts is appealing. It was considered as the cheapest of all food court, but with high quality environment. Overall we enjoyed the shopping in Terminal 21, it is great experience for our family."

Escalators called gates, etc. The floors are all themed and decorated after world cities. The basement has a Caribbean and beach theme. The ground floor is Rome, mezzanine is Paris, then Tokyo, London, Istanbul, San Francisco, 2 floors, and the top is Hollywood, with sculptures and Oscar statutes. The cinema is located here. The 2 San Francisco floors are all restaurants and food court. More restaurants in the basement floor also, along with a gourmet supermarket. The rest of the floors feature small boutique shops selling all interesting items. The walkways again named after streets in those cities. It is one of the better laid out malls with lots of interesting artifacts and sights of the different cities. Upon entering you can take one of the longest escalators in the world. I believe it goes up 4 floors. Worth visiting."

This mall was just beside BTS Asok and could also be reached by MRT (Sukhumvit). At every escalators, there were signages which were usually found in airports - \"Departure to\" and \"Arrival at\". Every floors had their own themes, which were (as far as I could remember) : Paris, Tokyo, Rome, London, Caribbean, San Fransisco, Hollywood, and Istanbul. The interiors were decorated on each particular theme, and moreover, I really enjoyed the...TOILETS! Yes, the toilets! They were modern, high-tech, clean & of course, unique, based on the themes. The one that I really liked was on top floor - Hollywood theme. When I walked down the aisle to the toilet, I noticed that I seemed to be walking on a red carpet & then I noticed pictures of lots of people \"taking photos of me\". Camera flashes could be seen a lot. Felt like a celebrity on red carpet :DI liked unique sketch pencils, leather goods and cute scarves. They're all provided in this mall and not standard ones nor \"standard branded\" ones. All were sold in reasonable prices, although some seemed to be overpriced. In the end, I knew that most of the goods sold there were local products, but they could present very well. The international brands were mostly on G(round) Floor & M(ezzanine) Floor. 1st till 3rd floor were the floor I talked about previously, 4th & 5th gloor were culinary floors, while basement for tidbits - supermarket & the top floor for cinema (that's why the theme was Hollywood)."

We went a couple of times to this very chic and cosy shopping mall mainly because it was very close to the intersection of the BTS and MRT (BTS station Asok).There are plenty shops, a cinema, a Gourmet Market, banks and a large number of coffe-shops and reataurants. All floors are thematically arranged, focusing on different world cities - the basement level has a Caribbean theme; the ground level brings you to ancient Rome; the M level re-creates Paris and Champs-Elysees; on the 1 st floor you will land in Tokyo; on the 2nd floor you will pass through London; on the 3rd floor you will discover Istanbul; then you will finish with exploring San Francisco on the 4th and 5th floors.The extensive food court is on the 5th floor and is called Pier21.And now about the thing largely mentioned in the other reviews - the restrooms. Perfectly clean, as in many of the other malls we have explored in Bangkok, but very interesting and settled according to the city they represent on the given floor. Just amazing, there were many people making selfies in the toilets! The shops and brands on each floor are oriented to the city of the floor - not so many world-famous and expensive like in the Siam malls. In my opinion, it is worth a visit!"

Beyond that, this mall was just completed as I was leaving Bangkok after living there for three years, thus I was happy I got to finally visit when I recently returned to the city. It is set up with differently themed floors, but all in relation to cities and transportation and travel. The third floor was by far my favorite with its plethora of little boutiques selling knickknacks and the like (NO SLEEP SHEEP). The ground floor and the lower ground all have mainstream shops and food. Floors 1 and 2 are clothing, women's and men's respectively. 4 and 5 are food and the 6th is the movie theater and entrance to the Fitness First. I spent several hours there are on my own and had fun just window shopping...."

One of the common dissatisfaction we experience in going to malls particularly in some countries we have visited is the restroom. Fortunately, Terminal 21 did not fail us but even gave us more than the unexpected. Yes, the place is not just a fashion and food haven but it is where the best \u201ccomfort zone\u201d can be found ever in Bangkok.. The facility is clean, spacious, overflowing hand sanitizer and sanitary tissue, hand driers and friendly housekeepers. But what makes this part of the mall unique is the themed toilet in every floor. Such as the Caribbean designed restroom at the lower ground floor; the spirited colors and featured drawings of Caribbean touch really attract travelers including us. To our delight, we did toilet hopping, of course not to answer natures call but to take selfie photos with our newly bought monopod. Who cares? After all, Terminal 21 toilets are not only for discomforts but it is also where you and friends can spell the word f-u-n. Whoever created this idea, I salute you, you got brilliant minds."

The shops are small, almost like a market in fact with a very interesting range of clothes at reasonable prices.On the fifth floor is the best food court in BKK. The prices are amazing, cheaper than street food and the quality is excellent. Kua gai for example is 25 baht and rad na moo 28 baht. Another must try are the delicious fruit smoothies and of course the definitive mango with sticky rice.

The best part of the place is the food court at the far end of the 5th floor. Go past the restaurants tp Pier 21 food court where you need to buy a card since the food vendors do not deal with cash. You cash in your card at the end if any money left on it. The front cashier will be very busy so make your way to the back cashier who is waiting for customers. We think this food court is better than MBK as far as price and serving portions. Nice bathrooms in this shopping mall."

On the London floor there is a London bus and a metro car which are made into small shops. San Francisco has the golden gate bridge spanning the area.

The basement holds a food court with loads of options, the top floor has a cinema with the latest reclining seats.

Sales people are texting and watching movies on smartphones and iPads and you feel like an annoyance if you walk in. It's like... can you not see I'm busy texting my friend or do not interrupt my movie? Many sales people don't even look up if you walk in... they continue texting. It's extremely inpolite and very uncomfortable to be there. I do not take visitors with me to Terminal 21 anymore because it gives a negative impression of Thailand with it's lousy service and no smiling store employees.Sometimes I wonder... don't the mall's leadership team ever walk around? And if so, don't they see how bad it is? Tell ALL sales people - ABSOLUTELY NO TEXTING OR MOVIE WATCHING while working. MUST look at customers, smile and help!The only stores that provid decent service is all American brands with trained employee like the recently opened Victoria Secret. Wow what a difference!"

Firstly it is designed a bit like an airport with each floor being a different famous world city. Secondly while there are many well known shops and chains there are also plenty of smaller shops and boutiques selling things you wouldn't necessarily find in the other 'standard' malls like Siam Paragon, Centralworld, Emporium, etc.It's certainly a interesting mall to visit with plenty of shops as well as places to eat and drink. It is easy to get to as well as it is at Asoke which is served by the BTS Skytrain and also the MRT metro.Definitely recommended as something a little different from the usual malls."

Try their fishball, which is very fresh. Food here is inexpensive, I even thought that it is almost the same with tje ones you will get from street.

I went on a whirlwind stint at some of the world's most iconic cities - all in downtown Bangkok ... when I checked into Terminal 21. Tokyo City, London, Istanbul, San Francisco - they are all there! A lifestyle mall with robust personality. Unbeatable! (for now?)How Terminal 21's centre management orchestrates their seasonal promotion will determine how exciting or jaded the experience there will be in future.Stepping this world of mind boggling difference brings you to new levels in your shopping and dining feel. But once exposed, how can excitement and wonder be sustained - when you next visit?The arrival and departure levels (via escalators) leading to different zones peculiar to a designated international city - which resonates quite closely like parts of the real thing - ensure that one is not bored when shopping or window shopping... or just bumming around.Christmas Eve, 2014:The atrium on each level boast Yuletide scenes that reflects the culture or the \"In Thing\" of the iconic city it represents. For example, Tokyo City's Atrium display is titled \"Snow Factory\" under the Centre's theme of \"Santa's Wonder Village\". There are obligatory Snowmen, Bearded Elves ... and pride of place is a huge Maneki-neko (Beckoning Cat). The featured cat is white in colour - for good luck. (Black is for good health to lure away evil spirits, Gold is for monetary good fortune). The permanent Sumo Monument, shows 2 giant sumo wrestlers, strangely ramming a stone pillar between them (instead of grappling with each other). Red Tori Gates, Japanese Lanterns covering every each of the ceiling possible along corridors. They are there. This level features women's fashion.At the London City level (men's floor), there's Barnaby Street for you. And there's a red train heading for Charing Cross in London's Underground (The Tube) - its selling Jeans! And one of London's principal icons, the archetypal red rear-entrance Routemaster is parked at the London City level. Its panel shows Camden Town, Covent Garden, Bond Street routes. Istanbul, is on the 3rd floor. You can saunter down a zouk & buy gifts, jewellery, fashion accessories toys,home decor items, beauty toiletries. The Mall's main highlight, San Francisco is where food outlets thrive.... in the form of restaurants and independent operators.For food court eateries, go to Pier 21 on the 5th floor.The 6th floor houses an 8-screen cineplex. Saw \"The Hobbit\" on Christmas Eve night... spacious, clean, top class, fantastic screen and sound, excellent comfort. Wow!The basement, with its Gourmet Market, takeout food joints, grocery vendors, banks and bookshops, has a Caribbean theme.Rome is on the ground floor, Paris on M level takes you to the Champs-Elysees where branded fashion awaits you.Yes... Terminal 21 is nothing short of 'Wonderful' .... if only more a much more robust and obvious Christmas ambience could be evoked... it would have been \"Fantastic\"."

Each Floor will give you different experience of culture, architect and feelings of big cities all over the world. You can find a lantern street in Tokyo Fl., Bus in London Fl., Tropical decoration in Carriberian Fl., The experience on each floor was so amazing that I can't help continue discover what will be in the next floor, next corner eventhough at that time my leg hurt and got so weary to stand with my eagerness. Beside, you can find many beautiful and original goods with reasonable price here. You can even find a supermarket named Gourmet market in Carriberian Fl.. I was surprised that some of its goods have cheaper price than Big C's (of course it cannot have the same quantity and variety as Big C's). You can even buy some Thai Milk Tea here, delicious >_<"

The sticky rice is superb.... well cooked and tasty topping with some yellow crunchy stuff!Another place to be praised of is the toilet! It doesn't look like a toilet to me.....

However, it's still fun to walk around and look at the cool layout as each floor or level is a different country which was a really clever idea and was done really well! We ended up going to the cinema which I would definitely recommend as it's a fairly surreal experience. There are luxury cinemas around Thailand which we wanted to do but didn't but this place was quiet a bit cheaper than home!! Just make sure you get an English film!

HmmmmmIt's set up like an airport, escalators with arrival and departure boards above them, arriving at London etc... Great idea, however there is something missing....Shops that you might actually want to shop in. Ok there are plenty of food shops, but remove all the food shops and there is very little left.If you or your family like souvenirs traditional Thai gifts etc then forget this place and go to MBK not too far away from T21 The themed areas are ok (just) the Golden Gate Bridge complete with toy cars stuck on top of it, now while some people find it very incredible, I found it a little tacky. There is a London bus that looks ok from a distance but up close a very poor representative of one made of plastic, a uk red style phone box but get up close and there is no phone in it its just empty. All the themed areas looked a little like that. A great idea on paper but the implementation was lacking.. Why they couldn't get an actual London bus or a uk phone box etc baffles me when clearly that is the whole idea of the design of the place. Costing millions and millions to build why stop at the final decoration stage?But the biggest problem is the shops. Simply there isn't enough variety. MBK is way better. "

It was design to look like an airport and every time you are going to a different floor, you feel like you are departing one country and arriving at a different country as each floor was designed with a theme of a different country. Like London fashion street for male clothing or Japanese Harajuku floor for female clothing.The food terminal at the Terminal 21 has a wide selection that you can choose from. But be careful when you come here during meal time at any day. It's so crowded you might have to wait or haggle for tables."

It's a place first timers could go to catch the interesting structures and take photos. The interest was there during the first visit but not as much during the 2nd.Food wise, the food court sells a good large delicious portion of mango sticky rice at cheaper prices compared to other food courts. Prices of clothes at the stores are inflated and I could get some pieces at half the price at Platinum mall and Union Mall."

You won't like this place if you are a large or super tall strapping Western body type, but if you are of a lean to medium body type, this mall is worth a visit. Each floor has a design theme, from Ancient Rome, through Japan and London which makes for a visually interesting experience. Many smaller designer clothing outlets selling interesting and well priced items. Well merchandised and a little quirky. We visited one evening for about 3.5 hours including dinner at a great Taco place. Purchased some great shorts around $20 aud and Tshirts about $7 for my husband and a few other gifts. It is not the chain outlets (H&M G2000 and others) which held our interest but the smaller more interesting stores on the levels above. Good if you have had enough of the usual tourist trap merchandise and want some interesting well priced merchandise you won't see everywhre. Really liked it."

The mall was really great, it was set up with theme levels, each level you were in a new country like London, Paris, San Fransisco etc. there was also a really great food court on the very top level where the food was really cheap and great. If you prefer not to eat in a food court there were plenty of other eating places one level below also well priced. If your in the area I would recommend a visit."

It's a great place for photo ops with the statues and the decor but ultimately, it's just another mall, selling the same things.I would totally recommend the iced tea from the Number One Brand outlet in the basement.

Its 31 baht from BTS and the platform is infront of the mall. No hassles. Never seen such a beautiful toilet. God! The toilet seat has a digital corner.... Impressive. Do not miss this place. The food court is not as impressive as Siam Paragon but you will certainly find something. I had a rice burger at the burger corner. Never eaten a burger made of rice. Delicious...Just go there. You will certainly end up loving this place. However if u r looking for souvenirs please hit Pratunam street. Amazing.You will get to see things u dont get to see usually.

If you don't like Thai food and crave the stuff you get at home, then the food hall is for you, a wide selection of mostly western (or Japanese) fare. If you want a unique shopping experience, you want value and you want things that you probably can't buy at home (even if it's just because they're knock offs), then go to MBK. Oh!

Having read about the Terminal 21 themed shopping mall and seen some of the pictures, we wanted to see it for ourselves.With direct access for the skytrain, it was quite something to see with the different city themed floors and d\u00e9cor, not to mention the extensive range of restaurants with a lot of European and American franchises.Most of the shops seemed to be smaller boutiques and seemed mostly geared to fashion \u2013 the prices seemed a bit on the higher end. I did however come across a branch of \u201cPink Pussy\u201d \u2013 a fantastic accessories shop with amazing metal evening bags, a crazy large selection of costume jewellery, scarfs, hair accessories, and all that is bling bling \u2013 but with really good prices.There was a motor cycle promotion and exhibit on the ground floor on our first visit and a watch expo on our second visit two weeks later \u2013 the motorcycle exhibit certainly drew a large crowd of young people.This is a great shopping centre to spend some time in just to see the different city themed floors \u2013 the d\u00e9cor was very good and well designed, and all the public toilets on each floor are themed as well, with no floor being the same. Definitely a fun place to spend some time."

Remember to buy credits/tokens. (Very common in Thailand but also a bit pointless). As others contributors have mentioned, each floor has a themed approach. Toilets are quirky, though do find the use of 'handicap' rather than disabled a little outdated for those less abled who need to use them. Right next to MRT and BRT stations.Overall a nice oasis of cool air, calm shopping(compared rob insight markets and MBK)."

Such a very original concept of a mall. Even the restrooms were of the same theme as the floor they are at. Especially liked the Jap themed one with lots of bamboo like material used and paper lanterns. Other than all the themed deco, this would have to be considered quite a well organised and clean mall with well thought out management and segregation of products. Look out for a Polaroid shop( I think on the 3rd floor) selling limited edition Polaroid sets for fans of these cameras. At the basement is a pretty good Thai Tea and coffee stall too. It;s the one with the a \"thumbs up\" logo on its products and cups."

This is one of my favorite malls in BKK, I have been living here a few months and visit this mall at least 3 times a week for dinner. I eat for 50 baht (max) which is similar to the street yet I know what I am ordering and the staff can generally speak english. The gourmet market (supermarket) downstairs is also good - has everything we need. There is a Nike and H & M there aswell as tonnes of boutique stores. The mall layout is amazing - worth a visit even if just for a coffee!"

It's an interesting shopping mall, each floor depicting the theme of a country - e.g Japan, France, UK, USA. One can get some good bargains here. For e.g I got some blouses and skirts, 200-490baht. Most of them are small stores and kiosks, with a few bigger and branded ones like H&M & Nike. The disadvantage is that trying is not allowed in some stores. The highest level is where the restaurants are located. There are quite a good variety - Chinese, Japanese, Western and of course some local delicacies.To go there, you can take the BTS. The train stopped right at the doorstep of the mall."

We shopped on a couple occasions too, some shops like H&M I found great value compared to home, others were similarly priced. My GF found some value but you should allow some time to browse, there's many levels and escalators in 2 sections, side alleys on some floors with little hidden gems. If you're from the west, for a laugh check out the toilets, they've installed the high tech Japanese versions :)"

The mall comprises of a movie theater, electronics, good quality local brands, departmental stores, pharmacies, grocery and lot of accessories' stores! Often filled with tourists! Has a lot of restaurants, fast food options a couple of coffee and dessert places!!! Every floor is designed in a different way. What I mean is they designed every floor as if it were local stores of a different country: Turkey, England, USA, Italy are a few of them!

We heard about it from a travelling friend who worked in Bangkok. As soon as she told us about the floors themed as countries and the heated toilets we knew we had to check it out!!Found it easily by taking the sky train from our hostel. The first two floors are full of regular brand shops you would find back home and at the entrance there is an information desk which is useful as you are likely to need it due to he size of the place. We went up to the fifth floor to the food court. You get a card and you pre-pay money onto it and then go choose your food at a variety of different places. Food is fairly standard and doesn't come out as good as it looks on the pictures but is very cheap! The Tokyo floor is all boutique women's fashion and the London floor is men's boutique fashion. I bought some amazing print to shirts you couldn't buy on the high street and the most stunning collared shirt! I went a bit mad with the credit card which was unlike me as I can't stand shopping usually. Themed bathrooms were very clean and the toilets were the best past! They had heated seat, heated bidet water you could aim and it even had a dryer ha ha. Friend of mine got confused and sprayed the jet everywhere on the floor so beware ha ha. Great shopping centre. Check it out even if you don't like shopping just to see how bizarre and unique the place is!"

You arrive at the mezzanine level, with an information desk and computerised store finders. There are no maps. You might notice that the security guards and information desk staff are unintentionally dressed like extras from \"Thunderbirds\". Each floor is themed by City eg Rome, San Francisco etc. London has a pastiche of a tube train, London bus, Guardsman ( with an unrealistic busby) and phone box. It is interesting to see the Japanese posing for photos alongside everything in the \"pretend\" London. The other floors did not have the same fascination. Sadly, for my wife who is petite, so sizes should have worked, the fashions were, well how can I put it, very Asian. A lot of dresses were a little Minnie- mouse or not in cooling fabrics. A lack of cotton and linen but strong on synthetics.We ate twice. The mall is full of eating places. The fish and chip outlet on the London floor served a really good cod and chips with tartare sauce. Strangely, it was served in a frying pan but this did not detract. After so much Thai food, it was welcome. It is alongside Piri Piri as it appears to be part of it.The food court is even more fascinating and incredibly cheap. Nearly street food prices and very hygienic. Dozens of stands serving their own specialities from soup through main courses to deserts. It gets so busy with few Brits but many locals. If you think a table is free but there is a small item there, maybe looking like a discarded bag, the locals use it as a marker to reserve their table while they select their food.Cash is not accepted but menus are clearly displayed at stands with prices. You pay at the cashier and pre charge the plastic card supplied at the cash desk with any amount. 100 bt for one is probably ample for a meal. Your receipt at each stand shows the spend and balance. The card does not show the balance so keep your receipt for next time, alongside your card. It is an inexpensive way to eat good food, in cafeteria surroundings, kept very clean and tables cleared after you. There is so much choice, you are spoilt.If you are returning by BTS in the MoChit direction, try alighting at Nana, one stop away. There is a great hairdresser on the station concourse, near the bra shop. They do men's and women's and speak English. If the review was helpful, please indicate by voting"

Each floor (almost, San Francisco gets 2 floors) is a different city and therefore also some of the shops have the flair of that city and even more so the food offered. It is nice since it is different from most shopping malls, of which Bangkok is well equipped.

I was pleased to find that CoCo Ichibanya, a Japanese curry house was located there as well. Ah, the curry!For those who needs Bangkok Sim-cards and have had trouble communicating with the 7-11s around, head on over to the highest floor as there's where all the large Telco shops are. There's bound to be a staff who can speak basic English who could help answer your queries. If in need for a quick Wi-FI fix, head over to the Information Counter for Tourist Wi-Fi login (you would need a passport for that)One unique attraction of this mall is of their restrooms. Each restroom has a different theme, by a different country (Technically by each floor but the restrooms show more details). Do visit each floor to check them out. I recommend starting from the top floor (many, many floors in this mall)and working your way down. No two toilets are the same as for instance the Japan floor has two toilets based of different Japanese themes. You'd only need to visit this mall if you are planning to hit only one mall.

If you are tired of casual shopping malls in Bangkok or if you are tourist and would like to see something new, this is your spot!I love the concept, that each floor is designed as different city and honestly they have the best bathrooms ever! The concept is different and the shops are too, you will not find Zara or Mango there. My favorite floor is Istanbul with a lot of accessories and interesting stuff around.As well, my favorite restaurant is Piri Piri Chicken there and i go to Fitness First Gym on the last floor.This shopping mall is located very conveniently, linked to BTS and MRT + there is bus stop around."

This is relatively new mall in Bangkok with some interesting theming in the style of airport departure gates and floors styled as various cities around the world. Lots of clothes shops, some standard chains and a number of restaurants of various sorts. Couldn't help but feel the shop layout was a little like an upmarket market. No real high end shops here.Food court on the fifth floor was great though. Once you work out the system of putting credit on a card at the cashier you then go to any counter and get your food, they take it off your card and way you go. Lots of good stuff, and almost street food prices so very cheap. Once you have finished, hand your card back to the cashier and get any remaining credit refunded.Great for a quick cheap lunch. Would not hesitate to try again."

            "review": "Great place to discover Thai food. If you have never tried Thai food or were put off by experimenting at a more expensive venue for fear of not liking what you ordered, The food court at Terminal 21 is the answer. The Thai food on the 5th floor food court is authentic Thai. Also you will note that the vast majority of the people eating there are Thai. The food is as inexpensive as your typical street vendor food, and just as good.This allows you to experiment with a little of this and a little of that for just over a dollar for each serving. The serving sizes are geared for Thais and is far from super size. So combining 2 dishes makes a hearty meal of it, and that is a good thing. Seeing that all of that food is likely less expensive than your typical single order from Starbucks, it is value, value, value. Even if you don\u2019t like what you ordered, being out a dollar is not hard to take. Just get back up and try something else. To use the food court you need to get a card at the cashier. You put money into the card and the card is used throughout the food court. Then when you are done just return the card to the cashier to be refunded what you did not spend. I suggest putting between 100 and 150 Baht on the card per person, you will get back what you don\u2019t use.The one down side is finding a seat during busy times. Wandering about with a tray in your hand is often the case. But with roughly 500 seats, one will become available in just a minute or so.Then once you have a bit more confidence in what you like in Thai cuisine, you can head off to a more upscale place if you are looking to set the mood for other adventures in Bangkok be they public or private."

These amenities contribute towards creating the atmosphere of the cities (London, Paris, etc) in which the levels inside Terminal 21 are named. My trip to Bangkok was short, lasting for 2 days only and I stayed in Sukumvit most of the time. As a tourist, I consider this trip relaxing, enjoyable and pleasing.

This shopping centre is very easy to get to, you can walk straight into it from Asok BTS station, I never really looked around the shops, but on the 5th floor there is an amazing food court, you first have to go to a cashier and get them to 'load' some money onto a card you then walk around the various different kitchens and order what you want they cook it in front of you and deduct the cost off your pre payment card, it is great food and SO cheap, four or five plates of food and a drink for less than 200B. When you have finished you return the pre payment card to the cashier and she returns any money you still have on it, all so easy!"

Good place to get out of the sweltering heat and spend an hour or two windowshopping. However we did not find the shops, layout or the \"airport\" theme very interesting. Overall, it lacks the elegance of Siam Paragon and diverse personality of other shopping malls in Bangkok. However, top marks for the excellent food court offering a wide range of local and Asian food with fast, efficient service. Although the servings are rather small, the average price of 50-70 baht per plate makes dining here an absolute bargain. It's practically street food prices and lower than the food courts in other malls. Oh yes...do check out the washrooms on each floor as the luxurious decor are all different based on the country theme of the floor."

This does have the benefit of being in a great location that is easy to access from many other parts of the city via public transit. The rest of it was all cool, but if have already heard about it, might be disappointed. The fact every floor is themed after a different city is a bit overhyped. Most of this is just very limited decorations related to that city and is mixed with large multinational brands, and Thai brands too, some disorganized and some things where they shouldn\u2019t belong.One nice appeal to this place is food. The food court I believe is located 3 floors higher than the ground level (G). Be warned there is levels below ground level. This has delicious Thai food popular with Bangkok residents. There is also Jaeh (thai word for vegan) food in the same food court. I ordered bags of take out of that for just 35 baht per serving. There are many other places to eat besides the food court. For example one floor down from it has MK, Mexican Grill, a Japanese restaurant, Swenson Ice cream and other shops. Another floor has a Starbucks, and Subway is down on the Caribbean level, and here I\u2019m just mentioning what I remember. Point is food in the food court and food spread all over.The shopping was filled with a mix of name brand and generic. There is some brand specific shops. The ones I noticed included Levis, Nike, and a Roxy&Quiksilver store. There are far more shops not named after a brand but many of which do sell brand names. The places we browsed had prices that were on the higher side, but nothing all that unreasonable either.Worth a mention is the supermarket for grocery on the lower ground (LG) level is very good. This has everything you could need and more for groceries and snacks, as well as a good salad bar too. This is self-serve, but when finished they seal it airtight. For those staying in the area hotels, that salad bar is a great option for taking back something to snack on between meals.This mall is however not much of a tourist attraction. Siam Paragon, or even MBK, is a place tourists might enjoy more. For families with children needing to make a choice of which mall to pass time in, Siam Paragon has much more to offer with their arcades, ocean world, toy store in Robinsons (which has games inside it and ability to sit playing with legos) etc. That place also has the same shopping as Terminal 21 and much, much, much more on top. I rate this place average just because Bangkok has great shopping malls, and again this place is mostly just a place to shop and eat which can be found all over Bangkok. The positives are location, and an attempt to make it more interesting with having the airport / various city theme."

I was staying in Sukhumvit while in Bangkok and was looking forward to this new shopping mall being on my doorstep (relatively speaking)The reality was that the mall is large, themed to look and feel like an airport with each floor dedicated to a different city and has a good selection of international brand shops.The problem for me was that it was a bit soulless, it was trying to hard to be international, to be cool and different and it was not enough Thai.I did however buy my wife a new handbag and purse at the Guess store :)I think its a great place for kids to hang out and spend their time after school and at the weekends, lots of food outlets an all floors and a whole floor at the top is just restaurants but for me I did most of my shopping at my favourite MBK."

We ended up doing this at the DTAC store on the top floor for anyone interested.We probably ended up spending around 2 hours here in total as we didn't realise there was a food quarter, and didn't realise the whole building would be so modern with air conditioning. If you fancy a change from local cuisine, there is a fantastic Mexican restaurant as well as many others, or even if you just want to get out of the heat and humidity for half hour and you're in the area, have a coffee here, you won't regret it."

In terms of preference, this is my number 2 amongst my top 5 favorite malls in Bangkok, right after Siam Paragon, and ahead of Centralworld, Siam Center, and MBK, in that order. Like many reviewers before me, I too was drawn to the interior design themes. However, I would not call it a themed mall, considering the products or merchandise being sold are mostly unrelated to the theme of the floor in which the stores are located. So the so-called \"theme\" is just decoration, nothing more really. That said, it is unique as the design sets it apart from other shopping complexes in town. What do I like about it then? Well, food. Again, there are choices that cater to all tastes and budgets. But my favorite would be the food court selling mostly Thai street food. There are enough varieties to satiate ones appetite. The best part of it all is that it is cheap, very cheap, comparable to those you would find at the roadside stalls.For those who are into fashion, there are hundreds of small little outlets with mainly locally-designed goods. Many of these stores carry products that cater mainly to the younger generation. Though not all are cheap, it is still worth checking out.The easiest way to reach the mall is by Skytrain. Get off at the Asoke stop. The mall is right next to the station and is connected by passage ways.Chris Lee"

Its similar to what you find at markets but theres no scammers or people who pressure you to buy. Infact, the staff were so unenthused with their jobs in some shops they had fallen asleep. This wasnt that unusual but we saw about 6 different shops where the shop assistants were asleep at the counter. This was an interesting photo opportunity for someone western as you would lose your job for doing that in a western country! :)"

The best shopping malls are all near SIAM area (Paragon, Central World, Gaysorn...) but if you prefer Thai brands and thai prices, definitely visit Terminal 21 mall. Right near Asoke BTS and MRT stations, this new shopping mall got amazing food court on 5th floor (chicken steak and french fries for 35 baht?), many popular restaurants like Fuji and Swensens, but the best thing about this mall is the design. Every floor is named after different famous city eg: London, Paris, Istanbul and even the toilets are matching the design of these cities. Its got many good places to take photos and the highlight has to be the massive lift rising from basement all the way to 3rd floor. TIP: the best coffee shop there is not Starbucks or Coffee world but the one tucked in the corner of the food court on 5th floor. Amazing iced espresso for 30 baht anyone?"

Each floor of this Bangkok shopping mall has a different theme based on various cities around the world, so it's like traveling to a new shopping venue when you hit each floor.My favorite is the 1st floor which featured Tokyo. The set up was really good. Filled with small shops with various clothes made by local designers. My daughters were able to buy shirts and blouses at cheap prices in this floor. Good quality for the price. Of course there are branded stores, too.Even their restrooms are different in every floor. And as you alight the escalators in every floor there's a landmark that would greet you. There's so much to see. You have to visit all the floors and enjoy everything that is featured. If you are a camera addict then take pictures as much as you want. Great souvenir shots.There are lots of restaurants that you could choose from. All types of cuisines. We dined @ The Terrace Restaurant - Thai Cuisine. Reasonably priced and the food was excellent."

Nevertheless, Terminal 21 is located very close to the hotel at which I stayed. Good reviews piqued my curiosity.From my (\"non shopper\") vantage point, it is just another mall. There is nothing I can say about the prices. The floors are essentially ordered by what is being sold: women's clothing on one floor, shoes and leather bags on another. This gives the shopper the ability to easily compare goods and prices. Whether it is better or not than other malls in Bangkok, I really don't know. I personally do not condone spending a tour to a foreign country in shopping malls.I did enjoy the food court on (if I remember correctly) the fifth floor. There is a tremendous variety of quality food at really good prices. And for that, if for nothing else, I recommend a visit to Terminal 21.Access by MRT (\"Sukhumvit\") or Skytrain (enter directly from Asoke station)."

Bargaining isn't hard at all as they are independent stores so it's easy to grab a deal on multiple purchases within an individual store. The only let down of the shopping Centre is the food court, there isn't that much variety to have a proper filling meal but rather the food is for those that are peckish."

Most shop assistants aren't bothered by a sale so don't really talk to you, good if you want a break from market stall owners. There are a lot of shops, most quite boutique like so you could spend hours looking at all the unique clothes. Well known brand shops are all normal prices too so don't go here for a bargain."

If you are a fan of shopping centres Terminal 21 is a must, it is not the biggest in Bangkok or the one with the best bargains but the design of the building is state-of-the-art and the originality and the beauty of each floor makes it unique.The facade is impressive, specially at night.The shopping mall is designed just like it was an airport terminal building and each floor is a destination : The Caribbean, Rome, Paris, Tokyo,London , Istanbul and San Francisco + Hollywood. Everything, including the restrooms , is decorated to remind the visitor of the name of the floor.Besides it is really easy to get there by both BTS and MRT.

Each floor is based on a different city, e.g. London, Paris, Tokyo, San Francisco, Rome, etc. and the decorations are likewise. It took about 4 hours to simply scale all the floors....without even going into most of the shops! The food options are incredible! The food court scales over two floors....apart from the food stalls on the ground floor! An amazing place where one can easily lose themselves for an entire day! The items are a bit pricey and so is the food, but you can find a good deal here and there if you look hard enough. Most of the restaurants at the mall are international chains and the food options cater to all nationalities. This mall is definitely commercialism at its best! Just when you think you've seen all the floors, you climb to the top floor which has a movie theatre and a video game lounge! the bathroom on the Rome floor was the BEST....it was spick and span, and electronically superior to any bathroom I've ever seen in the world!"

There is a good supermarket in the basement along with lots of food stalls, but the major food court on the upper level is great. It is very clean. Huge assortment of food on offer. There are a large number of restaurants as well spread throughout the Terminal 21 complex. We have eaten here on several occasions. There is also a good hairdressers with manicures/pedicures on the 3rd level. Usually there is a pop up sale on the entry level. Terminal 21 is handy for people staying near Asok BTS station."

Having stayed in the Sukhumvit area with family on a number of occaisions, I have had a good opportunity to explore a lot of the malls in the area and I have to say this one is my favourite. Each floor has a theme of a city (i.e. Rome, Paris, Tokyo, London, Istanbul etc) and the shops are also in that style as well. There are European designer shops as well, but if you are from the west, I would not bother with them due to the huge amount of import tax. It is not as cheap as the markets such as Platinum or JJ, but the facilities are better but there are other boutiques that sell other items that sell quite a few items that are affordable or the high end affordable. I even found myself picking up some bargains from more of the back end boutiques. Throughout my stays in Bangkok, it has been a great location to meet with friends and family as there are notable places to meet, take pictures and eat - you have places as cheap and tasty as the canteens and Mos burger to western and more traditional Thai food. You can also take amusement in the shops, displays. The toilets are plentiful and in great condition."

Nothing in it is affordable, and the quality seems a bit shoddy for the prices! It's not the kind of place that you can run into a grab a tee shirt or dress for the evening's activities, or pick up that left/forgotten item. It's slightly pretentious and the cities designated by the floors do not really seem to have all that much to do with the actual city it purportedly represents.It can be a bit crowded, and on weekends slightly overrun by teens who seem to be standing/loitering around and not really shopping, and kinda in the way if you actually came there to shop.I wasn't all that impressed with the Food Court - but I suppose it's mall food in all it's glory; nothing fancy or great or authentic!All in all, if you have nothing else to do!

They planted it right at the major intersection of the BTS and MRT Asok, and at the major roadway of the same name. This is a very tall, and very clean, swanky mall (which also has a hotel called Grande Centre Point, and is also located in T21), and there are all kinds of stores to choose from, as well as a large range of eateries. The mall is open everyday and from 10 to 10. My personal favorites/brands to spin by are places like 'CPS Chaps' which is a Thai based and rock themed store carrying both men and women's clothes and is on the right hand side when one walks into the mall from the third level (the same level as the BTS). Then, on the same floor is H&M which is in the very back. Next, on the second floor there is a Quiksilver store, and finally, on the basement floor there is a bakery called Breadtalk along with a Subway (which I've always enjoyed with it being an American based sub shop).* On the ground level there is a currency exchange booth for those who may wish to change out money. Finally, on the third level and right next to CPS Chaps, they will commonly have various sales at tables and small booths that will be set up from time to time. Products vary from clothes to jewelry to shoes and one can never really know what they will have but it's usually worth checking out if the vendors are at all set up. Access to Terminal 21 could not be any easier and can be reached by either using the BTS and getting off at Asok, or via MRT (the underground train). Even from T21, there are plenty of other places to explore via walking further west up the road as it being Sukhumvit Rd. and nearer to the tourist district, there are many other small shops and a Robinsons (a department store), teamed up with a McDonalds and Tops Supermarket.So, a number of things to do in this mall and alot of things to do in this area. Enjoy!"

The mall offers great little shops that are higher-quality than other major shopping malls, like MBK.

After eating street food and having enough of the dirty and manic streets of Bangkok after a couple of days or so it gets very samey! Heard about the food court here, it's like indoor street food but a lot cleaner and a lot more variety and at good prices.You purchase a credit card from the reception desk on the top floor on the way into the food court, you can credit it with as much money as you like, there is a small fee for the card and if it runs out of credit the vender you are using it with will not return it to you, so you pay the remainder in cash and will need to get another card to continue. But you can top up the same card at the reception desk before all your credit is gone to keep it going.Collect your tray, walk around looking at all the different venders, all the prices are clearly displayed with a corresponding reference number on boards on the back wall of each vender, all you need to do is state the number dish you want and the food is cooked in front of you (very fresh), hand over your card and the amount is deducted. There is lots to choose from.The shopping mall is modern and clean with security on the door, the guard may check your bags. The mall has a world wide theme running throughout it, i.e. London Underground, San Fran and Golden Gate Bridge etc, all very nice.The food is good in the food market and I can recommend it, try it for a change instead of going to the restaurants in the mallIf you found my review helpful please hit 'YES' and have a great time"

So, women's clothes on one floor, men's clothes on one floor, etc. Prices were not amazing (I wanted to buy cheap stuff in Thailand), but not over-the-top. For the number of stores, I don't think there was that much variety, but it was cool to wander through. Worth going to, if you have time, but not the most exciting shopping centre."

            "review": "Great place to eat and shop. I always make a habit of reading the negative reviews before posting my own to see if there was something I missed... Please take it from me that they are completely off the mark. Also, please note that I generally hate mall shopping, but felt compelled to write this review for Terminal 21.In short, Terminal 21 is worth the visit if not just to have a look at the toilets (as creepy as that sounds) and eat at the food court. In addition to that the stores are actually quite good, with minimal brand name stores around making Terminal 21 relatively distinct from the malls on the Sukhumvit BTS line (albeit not as 'market-like' as MBK outside National Stadium Station on the other line (the name of which escapes me).Each level has its own theme and whilst some may think it is gimmicky they really nail it with the toilets. I am not going to yammer on too long about them, but suffice to say it really adds a great quirk to walk to the toilets on the London level to have a London Underground theme! In addition, the food court is clean, cheap, quick and delicious with great variety. No, the workers won't respond to you in flawless English, but who cares? I can't see why that was a gripe in a bad review... Why would you go to another country and expect everyone to speak your language?! My personal recommendation for food is the pork salad from the stall across from the end of Golden Gate Bridge (you'll get it when you see it). I couldn't get enough and the staff got to recognise me pretty quickly!The shops inside the mall are great, with some really quirky stuff mixed in with the actually quite rare cheap touristy stuff. We (my wife and I) found that despite the confusing layout wandering around was fun and we got some great buys as a result. My personal favourite was a store called Folio, where incidentally I bought a great all leather folio with free name embossing. All in all worth a visit even just for a quick bite and visit of the facilities!PS. The biggest downside to the mall is the complete lack of an adequate directory. Very frustrating initially so only visit if you are willing to invest the time to walk down the 'streets' of each level.PPS. Feel free to bargain in the non name brand stores... We found that a good portion of the stores would bargain to avoid a sale walking away!"

I really wasn't thinking we would spend time in a Mall during out Bangkok visit, but the kids needed something so we popped into Terminal 21, what a nice surprise. Its not a very large footprint (but it is 7 floors) and on each floor they tried to capture a theme. Each floor represents a City and each floor also tries to cater to a certain demographic. What I really liked was the way they made many streets within each floor allowing for much smaller retail stores that were almost like \"stalls\" allowing local entrepreneurs the opportunity to have a store in the mall instead of all the usual global names you see everywhere. We were able to find many things for my teenage daughters ( and my wife too) from local retailers who carried new and unique fashions that we cant get back in the US. Also of course there are a fair share of knock offs on display.It was the holidays and there was always some sort of event or entertainment happening in the common areas.I really think this is worthy of a visit if you have kids with you and dont need the Gucci and Versace store to make you happy."

Every washroom is themed in a way corresponding to the city. You may run into a bakery shop washroom on San Francisco floor or a underground subway washroom on London floor. Give it a go!Shopping: Good mix of brands around from middle range to higher end brands. Each level has its own unique stores corresponding to the city it is themed with.Food: The food court at level 5 is something not to be missed. Not only is there a variety on authentic local food, they come in very affordable prices too. The service is extremely quick, yet the quality of the food is not compromised. You will have to purchase coupon in the form of a credit card at the coupon counter in order to get your food. It's a good system in a way as you don't need to have so much small change around. Check what you want to order and estimate how much you credit you need for your coupon before proceeding to the coupon counter. Fried oyster, pad thai, som tam and their desserts are not to be missed. If you are not in the mood for Thai food, no fret, there are a lot of other cuisines available as well.

I was travelling for business and Terminal 21 mall is one of the best shopping mall near the hotel (Sofitel Bangkok Sukhumvit) that I am staying in.It's located next to Asok Station and was built to resemble an airport terminal. Consisting of 9 levels of shopping and dining. Each level has its own theme, such as Tokyo for ladies\u2019 wear, London for men\u2019s wear, Istanbul for accessories, San Francisco for dinning etc.Even the restrooms on each level have a different theme. There was a restroom in bakery theme and I swear I actually smell freshly baked bread at the entrance to the restroom. It was so bizarre!Bargaining is NOT acceptable at this mall. Honestly, the prices here are more expensive than places like Platinum Fashion Mall or Pratunam Market. But you get to try on the clothing in a proper fitting room, unlike Platinum or Pratunam, where you just have to rely on your luck to pick out something that looks good both on the hanger as well as on your body. It frustrates me to buy stuff back only to regret the moment I put in on.Plus, there are abundances of dining options from restaurants to food court. Do yourself a favor, don't go to any western restaurants, try the Thai's. My favorite restaurant is Have A Zeed, which served the most delicious Grass Noodle with Prawns. I was so addicted, that I ate the same thing twice in 3 days! And there is also a supermarket located at the basement of the mall.Anyway, Terminal 21 is really interesting and makes a really worthwhile place to shop and dine. I would definitely be back when I come to Bangkok in the future."

Nice Mall, big, lots of Thai designer clothingThe mall is located just around the Sukhumvit Station. It is very convenient to walk to the mall. And as I recall there is a walkway on the MRT that will lead you right into the building without having to go down to first floor. This is quite convenient as most of the MRT stations in Bangkok do not have escalators.I would highly recommend this mall for anyone looking for local Thai designer clothing, it is packed full of it, and one of the few places in Bangkok to find such things. The other being in Siam Square malls. Also if you are hungry and are not interested in street foods, you can go here, it is clean and easy and the people are friendly, but be prepared, there are lots of people here, might be difficult to find a table depending on what time you come. This is the only mall in Bangkok where I would recommend eating. All the other malls we went to we ended up leaving as soon as we saw the eating areas as all of them were just really bad. But Terminal 21 is great for both shopping and eating.If you have any questions, feel free to write."

I am on day two of my visit to bangkok and while the large shopping malls are entertaining, i was frustrated that I could not find unique items to bring home for myself. Maybe we have gotten too global. I went to this store based on a recommendation of another writer on trip advisor. The items were very pretty and very well priced. Because the owner makes the pieces, she galdly adjusted sizes. I spent $125 and got a wide variety of gifts including ones for myself, but the money was irrelevant--the pieces were very pretty and unique"

She has a chart to show you what the stones are called in each piece.

There are so many options! Rice, fried noodles, mango sticky rice, noodles in soup, stew, dim sum The prices average to 35-45 bhat. Portions are on the smaller side.

As shopping malls go, this is clean, has a mix of boutique and chain stores but what sets it apart is its different floors and themes on each floor. A number of reviewers have mentioned this so I won't dwell further.What made me want to rate this (I don't tend to rate shopping malls....!!!) is its food court on Floor 5 called Pier 21. More focused on South East Asian cuisine, particularly Thai - the options are varied and amazingly cheap (most meals were less than 50 baht = less than 1 pound). You have to buy a top up value card to pay for food but like most places, you can redeem all unused credit. It lasts for 30days. I'm greedy as hell and love Asian food so I went nuts - topped it up with 500 baht (10 pounds) and was like a kid in a candy shop!I stayed nearby (Tune Hotels) and as they do not serve food, I came here for breakfast/lunch in total 4 times and came away stuffed every time - damage was under 300 baht so redeemed the rest on my last visit. If you do want to try other cuisines, pasta, Japanese, Fish & Chips etc, there are various other outlets. If you want to do a spot of shopping, I'm sure you will probably find something though I guess you can get better deals at MBK (probably anything you want, especially fake goods and souvenirs) or Pratunam/ Platinum Fashion Mall (mainly ladies clothes at wholesale prices - if you haggle)."

What's best is that different floors have different themes of a number of countries or cities. You have Istanbul, London, New York, Tokyo, etc. Even the washrooms have the particular theme of the floor. I found Tokyo the best. Clean, neat, orderly. The food court has a variety of foods, mostly Thai--and a very reasonable price. In addition there are many fast-food or other restaurants on all the floors. Some shops are quaint, interesting and even if you don't buy anything, its nice to just browse around. There is a cineplex where a number of latest movies, including English ones, are run.The place is easily accessible by train, bus or taxi."

It\u2019s well worth the visit if you haven\u2019t been before, if only to check out the cool theme of each of the levels! Set up like an international airport, with \u201carrivals\u201d and \u201cdepartures\u201d signs at every escalator, each level is decorated like a different famous city or area. There\u2019s the Caribbean on the bottom floor, with lots of gourmet ingredients for sale and a few places to get fast food or donuts, ice cream, pies, cake etc. Then there\u2019s fashion, accessories and beauty products on the next few floors: Rome, Paris, London (awesome alternative style clothes for guys), Tokyo (quirky one off type clothing for girls) and Istanbul (mostly shoes and accessories). On the highest levels (San Francisco and the San Fran Street Car level) there\u2019s a number of sit down dining options and I think maybe a cinema? The effort they\u2019ve gone to with designing each floor is amazing to see! The prices are a bit more expensive than your general Thai market places or MBK etc, but the clothing I\u2019ve bought is of a much higher quality too, so you get what you pay for. I love the Tokyo and Caribbean levels, particularly the gourmet market. My partner really likes the London floor, and both of us have bought heaps from the whole shopping centre every time we\u2019ve been. It\u2019s really easily accessible from the Asoke BTS station \u2013 it\u2019s actually connected to it, you never even have to set foot on the street. If you\u2019re in the Sukhumvit/Khlong Toei area, definitely make time to see Terminal 21 :)"

            "review": "Around the World in 9-Levels. Terminal 21 is a travel concept shopping mall. It could be reached by BTS - alighting at Asoke stop (light green/lime line). The concept is refreshing and it offers lots of photograph opportunities. Each floor is represented by a city of a country.The floor layouts of the mall: Lower Ground - Caribbean (Snack and Fast Food); Ground - Rome (Luxury Brand); Mezzanine - Paris (Thai designer) ; Level 1 - Tokyo (Local boutique); Level 2 - London (Men's Floor, jeans); Level 3 - Istanbul (knick knacks); Level 4 - San Francisco (City) (local restaurants); Level 5 - San Francisco (Pier)(Food court/international restaurants); Level 6 - Hollywood (Cinema & Arcade).DO: (i) Visitors should register as tourists at the concierge and enjoy tourists' discounts. Pick up a passport directory from concierge. (ii) check out the country concept restrooms on each floor. SHOP: The merchandise offered In Terminal 21 may not be as extensive and value for money as in other popular malls but it is still worth a visit. Tokyo floor offers flavourful local boutiques. EAT: Ate at Terrace, a fusion Thai restaurant at Level 4, its crab roe fried rice with thai duck was delicious. What was really exciting for me was discovering the design of each country concept restrooms - Tokyo floor, Japanese style bamboo concept, London Floor, King Cross Station concept restroom and Istanbul, bazaar concept restroom. Even the uniforms worn by the staffs were based on these concepts."

The clothes here is not too expensive (but not that cheap either). I found really good stuff at the Japanese and England floor. You can't bargain at this mall of course. But my mom tried to bargain a little bit, and she got a discount ! It was not much, but she was very happy with it.It's too bad that my stomach was full at that time, so I couldn't try the restaurants up there.If you go to Bangkok, your trip won't be complete if you're not going in this mall !"

It has a good number of the mid-range shops and many smaller shops which sell apparels/accessories commonly seen at Platinum Mall. I didn't compare prices though. Anyway, it isn't as crowded as Platinum for sure.The airport theme is definitely an attraction, especially the well designed toilets. But the biggest draw of Terminal 21 in my opinion would be it's numerous food & beverage options. There's Thai, Chinese, Mexican, Korean, Western, Japanese, etc. My fave was this little restaurant Yum Saap which serves decent Thai food at reasonable prices. I assumed that it's not a touristy joint as it was filled with locals when I was there for dinner twice. If you are looking for more variety, the food court at the top level isn't that bad either."

Like previously reviewed, the mall is designed to be like a terminal and the concept is like you are exploring the country at each level. It is huge and you may need at least half a day to cover all. Some tips:1) How to get there: Joined with Asok BTS and Sukhumvit MRT, how convenient!2) There is free wifi provided in this mall, Yay!! - just go to the info counter and register. They will need identification if you are a tourist (passport, ID or driving license will do)3) Plenty of eateries (maybe > 60) comprising small to huge lots and most of the famous chain restaurants are here: Fuji, MK, Tony Romas, KFC, Swensen, Secret Recipe, etc...etc...mostly located on 4F and 5F.4) You may forget all the eateries and just head to Pier 21 (foodcourt). Amazing food court with coupon system with plenty of local Thai food options...best of all, it is the CHEAPEST food court ever...(I know because we stayed for 6 days and surveyed a few food courts in other malls). You must must try the mango (35THB) + sticky rice or durian (30THB) + sticky rice + coconut ice cream (served in a coconut shell with bits of fresh coconut flesh (28THB). We regreted eating in one of the restaurants as we were too full to eat the local food which was in abundance and mouth watering!! But the mango + sticky rice is the cheapest and it tasted good too...very fresh...we tried everywhere else and nothing was < 80THB....5) Those who are for shopping will be spoilt for choice too.. men & ladies, everything is available. Some may find it too trendy and slightly up-market but if you hunt well, you may get some bargains...if you are into the cheaper options, then MBK is more for you.6) There is also a huge cineplex there (SF World) so it caters for a huge crowd. 7) Most important is the space...although crowded, you don't get the feeling of too many people maybe because of the high ceiling.All in all, would go there again, if not for the food, but the atmosphere."

The mall has different floors catering to different countries, with a distictintive country feature. For example level 2 covers London and it has a huge London bus in the middle of the floor with signs to Westminster Abbey. Even more awesome are, surprisingly, its washrooms! They designed them based on each country's theme and even has the janitors dressed in theme! This was a truly impressive and novel idea as it meant that the washrooms are not just a washroom. As a first timer, i had to visit all washrooms on each floor. Sadly, it seems that each floor only has one grand toilet, so be sure to find the correct one! If you do not have time, I will suggest the London / Rome /Paris washrooms.one thing I disliked about the mall is that, the mgmt separated different categories of shopping. All of the Men clothes are on 3rd floor, while gift and decors on 4th floor. While it made it easier to shop, it also meant lesser time spent on each floor and that shops are consolidated."

This is the epitome of 'touristy' The mall has 7/8 floors each styled as a different city/country of the world; Hawaii, Tokyo, paris, Rome, San Francisco etc. Each floor has some artwork/decor related to the particular city. Its a fun place to go and look at tourists clicking pictures of all the 'monuments'. The mall has many food options...and some of the better ones are on the San Francisco floor."

My first time here, I was rather confused why am I going to a country when I am simply going up the escalator?! I was really staring around to get a better understanding of what was happening, only to realise the theme is different countries on each floor. There are food at basement, that sells small snacks/drinks. Restaurants at 4th floor are plenty. But note that once past 9.30pm, many of these restaurants are already closed. Only very few not-so-nice restaurants are opened. I had asked information counter only to realise there is only 1 money exchange in this big mall - Can't confirm if this is really true as I had not combed the entire mall yet. But is rather ridiculous to have only 1! Rates are rather bad too. Go change money at MBK for more options to do your comparison. Shops sell mostly overpriced items. There are few and rare shops that sell things cheap. Also noticed that some of these \"push-cart\" stores actually have their big shop somewhere else in this building. Toilets are tagged with different themes too, go explore. Overall, would be a place I would go to get some free air-conditioning, buying snacks at basement and mainly to take some nice photos of the different themes/decors. I did not buy anything from this mall. FYI, this is linked to BTS Asok, very convenient to get to. Would say visit here, only if your hotel is nearby / just passing by / if you have extra time in Bangkok."

Read (given other countries, \"read\" is pronounced as \"red\" in this circumstance, as many American words interpret differently in how they're used in a sentence...whew) a previous review I just saw of how the USA doesn't have malls like this one & thus is more of a developing country. Ignorance isn't bliss, just stupidity. Well they do, if you ever bothered getting out of LA & traveling your own country; and a shopping mall doesn't make or define a developing country. I'm an American, born & raised in LA and will never piss all over my own country.I commented on this location in another review as a side note. It is a very nice themed mall/shopping center with everything you need for the typical tourist or non-American expat (exception to the American expat that has not really lived in America the past 4 years). Being a middle-class American, there are way too many things this country just doesn't have or allow access to. The prices here can be up to double or a bit more than what it would cost in say...Beverly Hills, California, USA - that would be food, beverages & any imported products...mindful imported American products come from China, Vietnam, Thailand & India :-) ...so they don't travel far. Though still believe Paragon is the better quality choice including food. MBK being a hit & miss but for cheaper electronics (however, be aware of fakes, do your own research beforehand). Back to the Terminal, also be aware of the 17% tax on all food & beverages (10% service charge which isn't for service but a made up tax to fill the owners pockets - none of which go to the staff; and the 7% VAT government tax) (my info isn't a guess, but 3 years of research...understanding this country is quite the challenge). For products such as electronics (value vs quality-wise).As far as myself, I'll only eat at the Tony Roma's & drink Starbucks, otherwise just use the bank, DTAC or AIS access; or just enjoy the air conditioned walkthrough to the BTS.I selected my \"Visit as June 2013\", but been here many times before.Recommended for tourists with money to spend."

Very interesting mall and it has been designed to look like an airport. It has the cutest toilets i have ever seen - so clean with lots of designs. The information counter also allows you to borrow a trolley with a pull out chair (very innovating). I wont recommend you do to any shopping at this mall coz if you have been to Platinum Mall and Pratnum Market, you will find that the clothing here are much similiar at a more expensive price tags. So i only recommend you to do sightseeing (i.e. window-shopping) and save the shopping for elsewhere. I like the food hall at the basement that sells a variety of Thai food. Do try the grilled octopus - it is deliocus! There is also a supermarket at the basement. It is expensive but i managed to get all stuff i needed - maggie mee, local spices. The mall is conviently located next to ASOKE skytrain. So it took us only 10 minutes to come from Chit Lom. Overall nice experience."

I would recommend checking out the Istanbul level for cheap homewares and gifts.It is also worth while to have a look at the San Francisco Food Court - I ate at Sunrise Taco and enjoyed the service and food.Terminal 21 is located near the Asok BTS Station, however I walked from Soi 5 and it took approximately 15 minutes. I decided to take a Tuk Tuk back to my hotel for 100 baht which took a lot longer than walking due to traffic congestion (a regular site in Bangkok)."

On the men's floor (3rd or 4th floor cant remember) in the back lane, there is a local Thai denim shop \"Rakucho\" that sells jeans with Japanese embroidered design, similar to \"Evisu Genes\" but with very good price and fantastic quality. Othere \"Evisu\" looking jeans I've found in Thailand look like it but are extremely poor quality, this is the best you can get, and its not fake, its a local brand.Also on the men's upper floor, there is a small shop to the right of the lift lobby that sells shoes and belts.

What makes this mall different from those located at Siam is that the shops - lots of them around the central escalators - are independent. Some are really cool Bangkok designers. Cool things to take back for your office. On Istanbul - yes, the area is set up to be named after parts of the world - the names seem to bear no relation to what is sold but it is a good way for remembering where you bought something in case you want to return. On Istanbul is a really cool little shop that sells flip flops. It is called Zhoelala. The prices range from 200-250 baht - similar to other prices for flip flops in Terminal 21 but wow...are they cute. I was practically run over 3 Korean girls who started squealing when they saw the designs. Down another aisle is a little shop that sells spa soaps and creams. Prices are only slightly less than in Canada but the scents are different and they put them in a patterned silk bag. There are places to eat and get drinks - note that the Starbuck's is often full. There is a gourmet market in the basement area."

I hope I am correct... :)The different levels have different themes from across the world, and this makes it really unique....So while shopping, you will also be busy clicking loads and loads of pictures...the food court offers good variety, I tried Thai green curry and Rice combo at KFC, and it was really good.The movie theater is also good with variety of offerings...In short... you will be spoiled with choices...."

Strongly recommend to try out the food hall - you buy coupon from desk (maybe 150 baht/person is enough) then choose from the different kiosks and point at the food you want (they have photos) and then wait while they cook it fresh, give them the coupon card, they will deduct the value for the food, after you finish, you take the coupon back to the desk and they refund any change. Great choice and very cheap."

Very cool concept for a mall, had lots of fun going around different floors and see the decor. They are amazing! Each floor pays homage to different country/city. It is generally quite pricy to shop here compared to markets and Platinum mall, obviously, but it is worth a visit, at least for lunch or dinner. The food court is great with variety of affordable food (i think it is cheaper than eating in teh famous night street food place in Sukhumvit Soi 38 by 10b lol) and yummy snacks. The only hassle is that you'll need to buy voucher for food in a card that you use like a debit card. (I bought 100b voucher and got 20b left in there TT) But it's a small thing. You could easily fill it with the amount necessary just to pay your food with making sure beforehand. All in all, it's a cool mall that is worth a visit."

However, if you want to check out some local styles, this is a pretty good place to go and escape the heat of BKK.The upper floors are good for men and you can find some pretty unique stuff that nobody will be wearing back home.

Many stores only 10ft x 10ft in size. Yet merchandising and product placement in these micros is really well done. There must be a leasing requirement to run your store layout through Terminal 21 designers. (Unlike MBK that is a free for all). Neat concept.

Terminal 21 was designed as though it is an airport and different level symbolises different country. Each level was decorated according to the country it was assigned to including the toilet. For example one level is called London, and they have the tubes on the level but with shops inside. So creative!In terms of goods, i think Terminal 21 provide a wide range of product where you can possibly find everything. I particularly enjoy the clothing there. A lot of variety and cheap too. But if you plan on visiting Jatujak Weekend Market to shop, you might as well stop yourself from shopping at Terminal 21 because i noticed that some of the stuff they sell in Terminal 21 also available in Jatujak, only that it is so much cheaper in Jatujak. Otherwise, if you want to avoid the big crowd in Jatujak, shopping here would be wise and reasonable too.Terminal 21 also has a movie theathre, a good one. During my trip to Bangkok, I got a chance to watch Iron Man 3 here and was impressed of the quality of the cinema."

They're using prepaid card systems, you have to top-up your card and swipe for payment.As for shopping, they were selling items like shirts and dresses which originally from chatuchak weekend market at a slightly higher price.

There is a food court on the bottom with a market and stores selling mostly sweets. However floors 4 and 5 are all restaurants. There is a large and very good buffet which really should be tired. However the best part is all the different small restaurants. This isn't mall food like in America, this is really good food in a sit down and served setting. For the most part it's inexpensive for restaurant dining, but more than street food (which should be expected). The mall is beautiful and spotless. It really is worth a visit even if you don't plan to buy anything."

It was horribly hot when I was in Bangkok so I spent more time in malls than I might otherwise. This one was a real treat. I even took pictures of some of the restroom designs.Plus the shops seemed to offer items that I had not seen elsewhere or at least they were more easily seen due to the mall's design."

It's cool inside, you have to visit the bathroom and check out the 'futuristic' toilet system. The food court is AMAZING!!! The food is really cheap, what Thai food SHOULD cost and it's tasty. At peak hours you might struggle to find a table though. There is a Gourmet Market which is great and the rest of the mall is filled with expensive labels. I visit malls for food purposes and wish I lived next to this one just so I could eat here daily!"

Wanting to save a full day for temple sighting, we ambled off in search of a light activity that would be worth exploring and give us some sort of reprieve from the hot & humid Bangkok weather.We found it! Terminal 21, located at the Asok sky train stop, is certainly worth a visit. Every floor had a different city-based theme; Rome, London, Paris, San Francisco, to name a few (the bathrooms also follow the theme of each floor and are impeccably kept).On some levels, a plethora of *tiny* shops (other than the regular-size H&M) line the walls, offering all sorts of interesting clothing items and jewelry options. On other levels, sustenance is the favoured need to be fulfilled, and many culinary delights await. The top floor has a few small electronics shops and a CINEMA, playing English movies with Thai subtitles. The Lower Ground level is for anyone with a major sweet tooth; this is where all the dessert kiosks are. Additionally, there is a supermarket that accepts credit cards... a major bonus. (All shops and restaurants in the mall seem to, from our experience)There are escalators between levels, as well as elevators. You can even exit at skytrain level, and save yourself some stairs (from street-level).Our visit coincided with a music festival, thus we were serenaded by Thai musicians playing old favourites. The quality was good and the live music certainly added to the atmosphere."

At the ground level we saw a showcase of local foods. It was perhaps, the best place in Terminal 21. Food was really good and cheap. (Maybe it wasnt that cheap but i think it was not that expensive as well, considering the prices of food in Cambodia in USD). At top level of Terminal 21, we saw shops of various tshirt prints. whoaaaa, i really love it. The prices of the shirts are just the same as ones from the night markets and Platinum. Probably, there are other places which sell these shirts in a much cheaper price but buying from here is much more comfortable. Well, i heard about Bangkorker in Khao San Road, but that's far and we didn't have time..."

It is fairly new and I believe it opened less than two years ago. From the bottom floor up where you will find a super market through the grand halls complete with marble like Greek statues or Herculean sized sumo wrestlers hugging a pillar, through a great, but not too intimidating food court and movie complex. The latter to spend a couple of hours cooling off, then getting a bite to eat.They have, by the way, the cleanest, free bathrooms in BKK. It is worth stopping just for that if convenient.When traveling, I always check out the malls, hotel or restaurants for the leanest bathrooms...just do.Terminal 21 has its own mark and is not like the other malls with their over priced, high end stores which are out of reach for many. While not low end fun shopping like MBK, it will not break your budget and there is something for everyone. One could easily spend a couple of hours here just meandering around and cooling off."

For a good sized meal made from fresh ingredients by locals in a pristinely clean environment for under 100 baht is a bargain.The location of the mall is perfect - easily accessible by Sukhumvit MRT or Asok BTS since it is at the junction of MRT and BTS.Didn't do much shopping but the range seemed good.

The idea of making it look like some destination with names for each floor, backfires amazingly.It has instead become a very confusing layout, where one must be used to this mall if one wants to meet anyone here.The mall is littered wth a huge number of smaller vendors, with all kinds of made up English names and words. They are basically competing in who is most pretentious. But when one look closer, this is nothing less than upscale junk, which one can buy in most markeds in Thailand.The majority of these small one or two-person stores are closed for a few hours each day, so the staff can go and eat, or be left alone with their mobile phones.The food court area is good, but again, failing spectacularly.Loads of teenagers running the stores and restaurants, making it frustrating for a tourist, since very few of them speak any English (a few words here and there).Look again, and one will notice that the vast majority of people in this mall do not carry anything which prove they didnt bought anything at all here.The location is bad, and is next to the busiest road in Bangkok, with 24 hours traffic jam.However, the sky train station (Asoke) is next door, for those who can use, or know how to use it.Almost impossible to get a taxi from the mall, due to the heavy congested Sukhumvit road next to it.With so many other malls in Bangkok, stay away from this one."

Firstly, every floor of this mall has a different concept - the floor and the washroom is based on a country's theme. We cannot help but visit the washrooms in almost every floor! And we weren't the only ones. Weird but you have to see it for yourself. The countries include San Francisco, Paris, Rome, Istanbul, Hollywood, Japan etc. The Japan's washroom is decorated like a Japanese tea house and the staff are dressed in kimono to fit the bill. For London, for example, one of the washrooms are decorated like a subway station. Pretty interesting! I love the shopping here too. Plenty of small shops selling clothing and accessories from their local designers. Quality is better and classier than Platinum mall. There are plenty of food choices at their food court too! And it's even cheaper than MBK! It's a cashless system so you need to get a stored value card. I most definitely will come back here again if I return to Bangkok."

A clever new concept for a shopping mall, a must see and now the best choice for daytime wanderers escaping the ravaging heat and pollution of the Big Mango.The new designs and lavatorial elegance somehow manage to eclipse Siam Paragon as the most talked about mall in town right now. Situated at the crossroads of Asoke junction, BTS skytrain and the MRT underground, it is perfect as an 'eat and greet' or date movie location. Rest assured that in the eventually of Mr. Bruce Willis being unavailable, cockney geezer Jason Statham can be seen flexing his biceps in the wings. Only Thai movie? No way people... Hollywood's finest understudy (cough, um) Nicholas Cage will be ready to pounce on your ticket receipt given short notice should you require it :) Yes, they like their action movies here, and why not... anything's better than that horrible Hobbit right now zzzzzzzzz. What a total flipping disgrace that was, anyway back to the review, sorry...as far as the shopping goes I'm not so convinced, it needs a real book store for foreigners like Kinokuniya at Paragon. Also visitors may prefer bargain hunting at the markets in Pratunam, Chatuchak and getting their electronic services at Fortune Town or MBK... but the stalls are funky and nice at T21 and plenty of places to eat at. All in all it fills in a few hours in a pleasing conceptual kind of way... and I like that."

Easily reached on the BTS Sukhumvit line, get off at Asok and enter directly from the platform. If you like Som Tam (green papaya salad) be sure to sample it here-they will make it to your taste, Thai style(no crab) or Isaan style with crab.About 45 Baht $1.50-also the sweet mango with sticky rice and coconut milk is the lowest price in town,about half the price of MBK(Mah Boon Krung) and fresh, at 35 Baht for half or 70 Baht whole. There are various stalls with any imaginable food found in Thailand. The shopping mall itself is very entertaining, and prices are fairly priced. You can also access movies on the sixth floor, and a market in the sub basement.Go where the locals go-here."

Unlike other huge shopping malls in Bangkok, it's not huge but still big enough for you to shop for 2 to 3 hours. It has many little shops and a few famous brand shops. Prices are reasonable.The great thing is, this place is beautifully decorated. It uses one international city/country as theme for each floor. For example, 2nd floor is Japan. 3rd floor is England. 4th floor is Turkey??? 5th floor is San Francisco. Each floor has its own unique decoration and it's great for taking photo. On the cinema floor, there are many giant figures too. For example, Woody and buzz of Toy Story, BumbleBee of Transformer, etc.. All these make the shopping experience very joyful.There are many food choices. Again, very attractive decoration in the food court and for each restaurant. For example, they turn a San Francisco cable car into a restaurant. Too bad we ran out of time and did not try any food there.If you like spa, there's a popular spa on the 6th floor and it opens until 12:00 at midnight. So it would be great if you do a few hours of shopping there, have your dinner in one of their restaurants, and finally finish your day with the spa. It would be a wonderful experience."

            "review": "a mecca for all. Containing local, hand-made clothing shops to world brand's like Levi's, to a movie theatre and gym, this little terminal to the world has it all. Terminal 21 is attached to Asok BTS (sky train) station and just outside of Sukumvhit MRT (metro) station while buses 2, 25, 38, 40, 136, 185, 501, 508, 511, and 513 take frequent trips outside of the building. One doesn't have to look to the streets of Bangkok for sightseeing, but instead step inside this world-themed mall to seek not only globally inspired fashion, but entertainment as well: Terminal 21 hosts year-round events! One might find themselves strumming their fingers to local musicians playing on the lower floor while enjoying a coffee at Starbucks, or stumbling out of somewhat bizarre and local restaurant, Reflections, only to find Chinese Opera Dancers reenacting a drama for Lunar New Years. A Transformer might greet you at the door one day, and the next week a mime may be welcoming you inside instead.Each floor of the 6-story high mall is themed from places around the world (Caribbean, Rome, Paris, Tokyo, London, Istanbul, San Francisco, and Los Angeles). A replica of the Golden Gate Bridge can be seen from the upper floor food court while a giant \"money cat\" welcomes you on the Japan-themed floor. The entertainment doesn't stop at the shops: Themes are continue into the bathrooms (most, if not all, are equipped with bidets). The most interesting, in my opinion would be on floor the 1st floor (Tokyo) and 4th floor (San Francisco). Prices vary, but the mall is overall more laid back than those up the street and has something to offer to everyone. Thai banks are located on the lower ground floor as well as a small grocery store that caters to the diverse crowds that shop there. There are many kinds of restaurants and food vendors spread throughout the mall, but the biggest \"food courts\" are located on the lower ground floor, and the 4th-5th floors. ATM's and internal phone booths are located within the mall, and free wifi is provided (as long as you bring your passport or a form of ID) on the main floor. Be sure to check out what kind of live entertainment is presenting at the mall! Some of the shows and acts are worth planning ahead for!"

The prices are slightly higher than in wholesale malls like Platinum but quality seems better too. And you can try on clothes for size before purchase. The sales staff here are also friendlier and more helpful.This is my current favourite mall in Bangkok (I've been to BKK 7 times in the past 15 years). Can't wait to visit again soon!"

For example, on the London floor it had tube signs, London buses, it was just amazing to see the detail that was involved in a shopping centre. Even some of the shops were themed to each floor and country.The toilets were absolutely immaculate too and pretty high-tech! We had lunch at an Italian there and that was delicious. Although I didn't buy any clothes, I'd recommend a visit to Terminal 21 just to check out the place. I've never seen anything like it in my life and loved loved loved it."

What is interesting about this mall is that each floor has a different theme or is designed after a particular city such as London, San Francisco, Tokyo to name a few. For a first timer, it was quite delightful to be greeted with some of the world's familiar icons. So instead of shopping, we went to each level to see what it had in stored for us. I have been to most of the cities featured but that didn't stop me from snapping pictures with these remade icons. And even if you have no urgency to go the toilet, please visit the toilets of each floors coz they too are designed according to the cities of the world. I especially love the London theme toilet which was modelled after the famous Tube and its trains. Love it, love it, love it. The food court is alike any other that you can find in Platinum Mall and MBK with the usual Thai fare like Phad Thai, omelette osyer, rice dishes and soup noodles. Taste wise, it was fairly decent. If you are hoping to find lots of clothes to buy here, you will be in for a disappointment as there are limited choices here and they are not cheap. However, there are a few shops at Level 2 & 3 which have some really interesting and uniquely designed t-shirts ranging from TBH250 to 300 (about USD 10 and below). Most important of all, the mall is conveniently located just at the Ashok station of the BTS. So, even the infamous Bangkok traffic jam cannot stop you from visiting. Terminal 21 is a winner."

There are also handfuls of boutique shops with local designer clothing that are very stylish for those shopping in the higher bracket price range.

However, we did not find the items in the shops interesting. Looks like an upgraded version of the things on sale from places such as MBK-styled shopping mall. Many shop units are tiny and this may have constrained on the variety of products on display. Sure, the famous brands are there too but it lacks the attractiveness of good quality products seen in Siam Paragon or Pavilion of KL. Perhaps, this mall is more suitable to the young or the middle-income shoppers. Still, it is not too bad a place to go for some 'aircon' comfort on a humid day.

The place is definitely quieter than MBK. We found a lot of friendly shops but also a few that should have posted the \u201cDo not disturb\u201d sign.An interesting thing is that you enter from Bangkok \u2013 thru the left door. But from then on you seem to be in Europe and you will be using the right escalator. Each floor has a theme from a city around the world like Rome, Tokyo, Istanbul, San Francisco and on the top you find the food court at \u201cPier 21\u201d which has good food at a very reasonable price. We had several breakfast/lunch for around 150 Bath for the two of us. If possible avoid the lunch rush 1-2pm. There are also a lot of restaurants in different styles, to choose from.In the weekends there will be some show or sales promotion on the big lower open spaces. This will draw a crowd and be noisy.In several of the shops we found the mid-year sale with \u201cNo fitting, No exchange, No refund\u201d. Personally I would have walked away because of that but the people working there encouraged fitting anyway only there were no fitting rooms... Compared to that I bought two pairs of short pants on the street only to find they were too small so we brought them back the next evening. \u201cNo problem, I bring bigger tomorrow, you come and pick up\u201d.

Most visitors will spend a lot of time when visiting Bangkok, There are over 38 main malls I hope this will act as a guide to some visited.t1) The Terminal 21-Listed as my favorite - direct access from both Asoke BTS Skytrain Station and Sukhumvit MRT Subway Station. Each floor features a World area and decorates to that area. Beatiful statures from Angels too many areas from London, Paris, San Francisco, Hollywood, Tokyo, and Istanbul, all very good taste. Food court in Thai Food is impressive with each area featured in a theme. Many International restaurants abound. All concocted to its impressive 36 meter long escalator which connects together all the continents. Even the toilets are upscale with temperature self programming features and restrooms are exceptional. Over 600 shops World Class Mall.2) Siam Paragon-Access by BTS Sky Train to Siam Station. It\u2019s one of the biggest shopping centers in Asia offers all kinds of international fashion brands, 15 large movie screens; one of them has the biggest screen and seating capacity in Asia. Siam Ocean World - the largest aquarium in South East Asia, an exhibition hall, the Thai Art Gallery and an opera concert hall. 3) Gaysorn Plaza How to get there: Gaysorn Plaza is located on the corner of Phloen Chit Road and Ratchadamri Road (Chidlom BTS Station) Taxi / Bus no. 2, 25, 501, 508, 511, 513 Gaysorn Plaza is a premier luxury shopping mall offering brands like Armani, Gucci, Tiffany among many others. The top floors have a good selection of Thai handicrafts and antiques distinguished by their high quality and fairly high prices too.4) The Emporium-Sukhumvit Soi 24 (Phrom Phong BTS Station). The lower floors dedicated to brands like Louis Vuitton and Rolex, but it has more affordably priced goods on the upper levels. Many restaurants with the Greyhound Caf\u00e9, very good food at fair pricing. The top floor and you will find an amazing private library centered on design. You can get a free day pass if you bring your passport.5) Central Plaza Grand Rama 9-Directly linked with the Rama 9 MRT Subway Station\u2019s exit.  Have cinemas, karaoke, and ice-skating. In addition, more choices for varied lifestyles are also offered from fitness centre, yoga studio, beauty clinics, salons, art and music schools, martial arts and language institutes. Good and enjoyable with many shops not found at the other malls.6) Central World Shopping Complex-BTS Sky Train to Chidlom Station.

With this in mind, I found Terminal 21 refreshingly innovative.As pointed out by other visitors, each floor is themed. While the theme thing could have been done better, it still makes the mall stand out compared to more traditional ones.Clothes are not exactly cheap but you can get good deals if you are willing to take your time. Prices are more affordable than what you would get in nearby Kuala Lumpur and Singapore for example. You have plenty of independent shops rather than the big brand ones (some like Esprit, Nike and Adidas do have a presence). Also Terminal 21, while being large enough to offer a wide range of shop choices, is still small enough to avoid the pitfalls of gigantic malls which exist in other parts of Bangkok. I was satisfied with my shopping there.Now where the mall becomes really great is its foodcourt, which spans two whole floors (the two top ones). I ate in the foodcourt only twice (KFC and a Thai restaurant, \"Reflections\") and on both occasions the food was very good and affordable. In my own country I don't usually eat at KFC which I find disgusting, but Thailand's KFC is different and offers a very distinctive meal of rice and chicken for just 75-80 baht. I spent eight nights in Bangkok and could have eaten out at the foodcourt every single of these nights without ever eating at the same place twice. Plus on the other floors you also get food choices, I ate a wrap at a Mexican snack and it was delicious.Little tip: at basement level, you have a grocery which sells all kinds of food. You can buy yourself a self-service salad for a very low price, and you even get to choose your salad dressing!"

            "review": "This is not a MBK. Some of the reviews made a comparison of T21 to MBK. I dun think its fair to comment as they are 2 different malls with completely 2 diff concepts. The key of this mall are 1) little shops selling their own niche largely local designs (there are a few intetnational brands), leather goods and shoes are cheaper than most developed cities. 2) not as crowded as platinum or mbk with big walking aisles. 3) probably one of the cheapest food court. Realize portions may not be as big as the foodcourts say in MBK. Sticky rice at mbk is 120b and t21 at 70b for comparative size. (but mbk still nicer). So it's a good foodcourt to try many foods. 4) lots of restaurants to choose from (probably one of the most of any malls- comparable to central world?)well, cons are its out of usual shopping belt but worth a visit for you to determine if you like this mall. I say it fits the young and trendy more. New mall- only a year old. With a few more mega malls opening at siam BTS soon... Competition will be keen and Bangkok is shaping up to be a major shopping paradise with clear niche shopping concepts!"

It's really an attractive area, with different themes of countries for each level, and you have a great deal of restaurants at the top level. I love going to the hairdressing at one of the beauty salon and spa named 'Take Care', and my gf was satisfied with their pedicure service as well. Apart from the prices, it's actually quite a great place with great ambiance. Didn't really get to shop the entire area. However, I find it rather inconvenient for me as it was abit further out from the city area like Siam/Pratunam despite being connected by BTS. Furthermore, the goods are also sold at a higher price."

The bottom levels are similar to a normal mall with the usual shops...then the upper floors are more like a market place with small shops. I really liked Istanbul which had homewares, jewlery and shoes, etc. There is also a good selection of restaurants. I wasn't looking for the cheap bargains so I found this mall quite nice as you could get the market feel but in a nice atmosphere. I also went to Central and a few other places that just made me feel like I could be at any mall as it just had the usual shops..Prada, Gucci, Zara,etc...this was a nice mix."

I don't normally visit malls on holiday, but ended up in this one and found it was a fun place to visit as it's quite unique - every floor is themed around a different city (London, Paris, Rome, Istanbul, San Francisco and Tokyo I think) with an overall 'airport' theme. The detail in doing these themes was quite impressive! It seemed there was a good range of shops too. But what was really great was the food court - every kind of Thai food on offer, plus some Chinese/Japanese options too. I had a superb prawn Penang curry with rice for only 40 baht! It seemed to be very popular with young Thai people. Also, as others have said, the toilets were a bit of a novelty!"

            "review": "Unique mall and definitely worth a visit but there are better malls to go to. First things first, if you are in Bangkok you have to visit Terminal 21. Simple as that. Its unique concept showcases each floor as a sort of loving tribute to a particular city like San Francisco, Tokyo, Paris etc. The entire mall is modeled like an airport and there are departure gates and arrival gates and the whole thing is done to a degree that you have to appreciate. Each floor has particularly memorable architecture in this regard such as the golden gate bridge, two giant sumo wrestlers, a lighthouse, a full size London double decker and many others which I won't spoil. Another area where Terminal 21 deserves the highest credit is an area which I never thought I would have to mention in any of these reviews - the bathrooms! I have to give credit to Trip Advisor for telling me about these in the first place but they are amazing. Each floor has uniquely designed bathroom areas which are fully integrated with the City setting and again show surprisingly huge amounts of attention to detail. But thats not it only. Each toilet is filled to the brim with electronic gadgetry, so don't be surprise when you see a bunch of buttons in the toilet. Again, I hope they can maintain all that in future as well, but it is hands down the best bathrooms I have seen in any mall.Having said all that good stuff, I have to get to the point - and the point is the mall isn't really that great when you take away all the gimmicky stuff(I loved it, but really only for the novelty effect). As a proper mall, Siam Paragon is still way better and includes not just a movie theater but one with an IMAX screen. In addition, I found very few shops which I am interested in, unlike Siam Paragon. The food court was good, but again can't compete with the mind boggling amount of food spots around the Paragon area."

The concept of Terminal 21 is unique because it is patterned to look like an airport, having each floor molded in a certain country. Shopping here is also a treat because it combines the price of the market, with the beauty of luxury malls. Some stores even give you discounts if you are their first customers. The stores offer what other bangkok malls do not --uniqueness. Some of the stores here are managed by the designers themselves, and they offer you items that are not found elsewhere. Unlike market stalls and MBK which offer the same items in almost all the stores, Terminal 21 has those one-of-a-kind stores that make you shop and shop. For the people that want items only a few people own, this is the place for you. Although it is quite small, you will find yourself exploring all the floors because of the way it is constructed.

I was astounded when I heard this but that's a foreign country for you and you have to respect their laws and yes, this is law. I also found that for equivalent brand name items from the west, this mall offers the same products at slightly a better deal. Of course to top it off, you have the well renowned Starbucks for some decent coffee in BKK. This mall just opened recently in August 2012. Definitely worth checking out and all 6 floors of it."

If you are looking for a good place to get out of the Bangkok sun and get some air conditioning and a bite to eat, I recommend it.

A must Visit mall in bangkok"

Given its young age, the centre was absolutely spotless, looking like it had opened just yesterday. The shops are a mixture of trendy cafes and clothing boutiques, with an assortment of other goods available. Each level has a theme, from renaissance France to the Caribbean, making the design and d\u00e9cor of the centre quite interesting. A very good shopping complex and certainly worth a visit. Access is very easy, with the Asoke BTS station and Sukhumvit Metro Station right next door."

We compared the food courts in various malls we've been to and we think they have the cheapest prices. You can get a meal for 35 baht. It's also connected to the BTS station which makes it very convenient. We didn't check out the shopping as much because it seems a little bit pricier than Platinum Mall but they seem to have cooler clothes too."

Since everyone already talked about how nice is the design of each floor of this great Mall, the location and the whole ETC, i will like point at the fact that is the perfect place for low budget tourist but not for shopping cloth but for eating!The street food (just judging by the look) looks cheap but the reality is that one single element (let's call element to for example a stick with three maximum four pieces of BBQ chicken) can cost an average of 20 Bahts but in the top floor of this shopping mall is possible to find a plate (not big but still a plate) of a well presented local dish for 30 Bahts (if you want to go for fancy stuff can cost an average of 45 bahts or if you like to eat Pork or Duck can cost an average of 75 Bahts). Is also important to notice that the variety of dishes offered is even bigger than in the street, the flavors are good and is served on a nice environment."

So if you are in Sukhumvit (Wattana) or wisely using the Skytrain to travel around from elsewhere in the city, then head for Terminal 21 as both a shopping venue and a casual place to stay cool and to eat great Thai food.The shopping mall is multi-storied, attached to the Grande Centre Point Terminal 21 hotel, close to Nana and Asok stations, and well known to taxi and tuk-tuk drivers. it is clean, modern, security conscious, with good information desks and parking, and most essentially has good toilet facilities. Branded international stores and local Thai stores as well as having all manner of merchanise and a very good supermarket that is acceptably priced. There is an exceptionally good delicatessen section with quality fresh meat, fish, bread products and produce. It seemed clear the local 'expat' community shops there and yes there is plenty of Chang and Singha. NB decent wine is expensive here as it is through out Thailand.The designer stores and merchanise shopping is expensive in some respects on a Thailand scale but the choice is enormous and the sale prices were attractive in September. There are stalls down on Sukhumvit Road for the true bargains and copy products. Head to level 5 for the food hall throughout the day. It leaves other food outlets such as at the MBK and around Siam Square in its shadow; the locals' patronage confirm that this is great and cheap Thai food, with a huge variety of specialist vendors, and as hygenic as you would want. Payment is by a debit card system and they do refund unused baht. We found 200 - 300 baht went a long way. Go early for an evening meal as some places do run out of food and then close down reflecting popularity. However, you cannot buy beer with you meal.If you have just arrived in BKK, your hotel is nearby, you want to be both careful and eat at a modest price, and rather than eating at your hotel you came to BKK to enjoy some local \"colour\" and genuine courtesy in the service, then this is a good place to start your BKK experience and it may also be where you finish too. Enjoy the experience,"

It is full of quirky boutiques showcasing a lot of local designers and the prices are reasonable to mid price. the building is airy and lght . It's a much nicer and comfortable shopping experience than mbk; platinum fashion mall or chatuchak ( a lot of the chatuchak designers have a boutique at terminal 21) as it's less crowded, sweaty and frantic. There's 100's of unuausual little boutiques to explore on the various levels so i recomend that you visit several times exploring a different floor or space yourself for a longer visit as there's plenty of drinking and eating spots to have a rest and a refueling as well as the famous themed toilets on each floor. Personally i was staying in hotel 5 minutes walk away so i was popping in every day for a mooch of an hour or so, visiting a few boutiques at a time. If you like individual style and wear things nobody else will have at home; you will love this place. there's something for everybody from men's clothes, to accessories , jewellery , home decor, cosmetics, shoes etc.... Thai style is all about cute prints, bright colours and quirky details. The sizing is the only drawback for most westeners as the Asian sizing runs on the small side. it you are above size 12 for women it gets a bit difficult. But you can still find knitwear, teeshirt and accessories galore."

The theme extends up to their toilets or restrooms on each floor. I particularly love the Tokyo restroom, the mirrors are in the shape of sunglasses and the faucets are hidden. So don't forget to bring your cameras when visiting this mall.My favorite thing about this mall is their food court on the 5th floor, Pier 21. There are a lot of choices but most of all, the food are the cheapest amongst all the food courts I've been to in the Bangkok area. When I was there in August 2012, I had Pad Thai for 30 baht, and I even saw Fish with rice and veggies platter for 25 baht.There are a lot of small stores, but what I enjoyed the most were the ladies fashion accessories shops on the Istanbul floor.To get to this mall, take the BTS Skytrain Sukhumvit line and get off on Asok station. Take exit 1 and you end up inside the mall. You can also take the MRT and public buses, but I personally prefer the BTS Skytrain."

You will see themes on every floor i.e. Japanese ( luvd the rows of paper lanterns), British ( luvd the Charring Cross booth), Turkish ( luvd the Turkish dancers statues on the columns), American ( luvd the huge Oscar statue)... other than that there is nothing much to look forward too. As you walk thru the rows of shops, you get this feeling that you are in Chatuchak! just that this is a highly organized and priced mall ...As for the restaurants.. nah!! give it a miss!Go if you must, but don't expect anything out of the ordinary!!"

            "review": "Best Location in the City, Best Toilets, Excellent Movie Theater, So-So Restaurants. Terminal 21 enjoys the premier location in Bangkok, at the nexus of the SkyTrain and Underground stations at Asoke and Sukhumvit. You can walk into the mall directly from the SkyTrain platform, which is very convenient. Movie times are displayed on a sign board right at the entrance. There are two ways to move around Terminal 21, by escalator and by elevator. If you want to purchase movie tickets before dining or shopping, proceed towards the back of the mall, straight as you walk in from the SkyTrain platform entrance, and the elevators are on the left hand side. You want the sixth floor. Very fast, convenient layout. Once you have your movie tickets sorted--and I do recommend that you spring for VIP seats with roomy two-person reclining couches--take an escalator down a floor and have a look at the restaurants. I will save you a ton of time and grief. There are basically two places worth patronizing in Terminal 21: Fuji, and Sunrise Taco. By all means, avoid the Tony Roma's unless you like tourist traps. I review all three restaurants elsewhere on this site. There are plenty of other restaurants, but none that are just outrageously excellent. The food court is very affordable, if you want local food at local prices. For tourists, this is a good thing to do, as it also is for travelers on a budget. You can eat cheap, and you can eat good, in the food court. As for other restaurants, the basic rule of thumb applies: if they are not crowded, you can assume that the provender is not that good. Fuji, of course, is Fuji. It is sushi and sashimi and it is consistently good and edible. Sunrise Taco.....is a crap-shoot. You simply do not know if you will have a superb Tex-Mex dining experience, or if you will be angry and disappointed. If you are accustomed to true Tex-Mex, as offered in San Antonio, or San Francisco, or any family restaurant run by immigrants in America, do not think that you will get food remotely comparable at Sunrise. For Bangkok, Sunrise can be decent. But it is not consistent. Sometimes it is good. Most of the time, it is not that good. Yes, these are bold statements. But patronize them, and see if you disagree. Terminal 21 is not a place to go for shopping. There are no name-brand outlets. Just a bizarre hodgepodge of small shops selling purses and earrings. Your womenfolk may enjoy exploring it, but I guarantee that the males of the species will loathe it. Release your women to go shop, and then go settle down with a pitcher of margaritas at Sunrise. Watch the girls go by. Just be advised that for some reason that I cannot fathom, this mall is not one of the premier girl-watching venues in the city. It does not compare to Esplanade shopping center, for example, or to Fortune IT Mall. I have no explanation for this. I merely report. The best feature of Terminal 21 has to be its toilets. Such a small thing, you think, but when you are out and about in a major metropolis like Bangkok, teeming with people, seething with bacteria, toilets, and their availability, can be a major factor in your ability to enjoy your day. There was a time when it was difficult to find a toilet at Asok junction. Not now. You can slide into the Black Swan British pub across the street from Terminal 21, you can duck into the small Italian deli and restaurant Pala Romana beneath the SkyTrain platform, next to Dunkin' Donuts, or you can waltz into Terminal 21 proper, and utilize the best toilets in the city. I highly recommend the Terminal 21 toilets. I mean, I make excuses to go to Terminal 21 if I even remotely feel the urge to utilize the facilities. By far the weakest aspect of Terminal 21 is the poor quality of its shopping and its restaurants. The entire mall is saved, and even distinguished, by its toilets. The object of so much adulation is a Japanese invention that replaces the quotidian toilet seat. It looks like a toilet seat, and to an extent, it functions like a toilet seat, but it is so much more. It has the capability to direct a sustained jet of warm water at your posterior, and the water jet can be minutely adjusted. It has a drying feature, where warm air chastely flows across your nether regions. It also features a bidet function, though its distinction from the butt washing feature escapes me. They both seem to do the same thing, and in the same general area. Perhaps it is a slight matter of water direction. As best that I can tell, such luxuries cost approximately $80 per copy when purchased at a home improvement superstore. I laud the management of Terminal 21 for making such a costly and decadent investment in their establishment. Despite bad shopping, and a lack of good restaurants, Terminal 21 is saved by its toilets. Considering its location at the heart of the city, Terminal 21 is the premier shopping destination in a city full of malls. If only all Bangkok malls would install those Japanese sanitary wonders. Hope that this helps! Enjoy."

The selling point of Terminal 21 is the airport concept. The receptionists at the information counter/security guards dressed like air hostess/steward. Escalators decorated like the boarding gate. It was basically divided into 8 levels, each named after a city. The top level is a cinema and hence named Hollywood. The next 2 levels and the basement are restaurants serving international cuisine and a huge food court. The remaining floors are shops - Tokyo, Rome, Istanbul, London, each decorated with well-known icons/landmarks such as Japanese fortune cat, British Royal Guards, Roman fountain and fresco. There are chained stores as well as small business - hence the variety of goodies are quite diversified. Adequate sitting areas for kids and elderly to take a rest after shopping. Shopaholics would also be most pleased to ponder around. One interesting point to raise is the washrooms - the modern toilets with various automated functions and the magnificent view of Sukhuvmit outside the windows (ladies' toilets at higher level). Suitable for people at all ages who want to go shopping, dining or just seeking a shelter away from the heat of the sun or other overcrowded shopping centres at Silom and Siam. Highly recommended."

We found the food court to be ok, cheap enough and good views from the window tables. Most food'we had was rather 'food court' the stand outs for us were the durian and sticky rice in coconut for around 60baht and also mango and sticky rice, we went back a few times just for this and washed it down with the excellent frozen fruit smoothies from the stand beside the sticky rice. Lots of cafes and restaurants here too, pretty much for every taste. This is a bit of a strange thing to say but the toilets here are worth a visit, many floors have amazing views from the toilet entry area and they are also themed and an army of cleaning ladies keep them in good nick.Mr Fayvan always complained that the Men's was always full of ladies with mops! We also went to the movies here, you can have a coffee while you wait for your movie to start in big comfy chairs and look at the skyline.

Personally I found the themes whimsical, tacky and disjointed but got a rise of the attempt to try something different; it's hard to fault the ambition or bravado of the project. I did not get a rise out of the food offerings which are shockingly bad (low end chains) but fortunately I found a scaled down Seefah sub brand which while lacking in choice was excellent and good value...If you do decide to go I earnestly suggest the skytrain, the exit is level with the entrance and couldn't be much closer. The MRT is also a pretty good option but make sure you get the right exit or you'll feel like an extra in the old classic frogger video game. Asoke interchange is one of the busiest in Bangkok so it's a traffic nightmare, that said if you're driving you can pretty much park on the floor you want to go too!!Hope this helps!"

If elevators are your thing they have him here in every direction all suggestive of idiocy like going from London to Paris etc. yet the merchandising doesn't reflect this leap.

There weren't a lot of childrens shops. Can be a bit pricey some of ladies boutiques. About the same price as back home.Loved the food hall on the 5th floor called Pier 21. Dishes cost approx 30-60 baht. Keep in mind for the westerner you may need 3 dishes. My 6 year old could eat 2 dishes. But still quite cheap. You need to buy coupon first before ordering food. It was very hard to get a table around lunch time for family and that was around 1pm. Dinner was easier, but food stalls might have very limited food and that was around 8pm.What amazed me was that people would put something of their's on the table to say it's taken and go off and order their food like a book, bag, ID tag etc, so when others were going to sit down, they realised table was already taken, they would just walk off. Back home no one would care and you'd probably find your belongings gone."

This is a shopping centre like no other you've ever been in: every floor is themed to a country (New York, London, etc), and decorated accordingly - so (for example) the London floor has a big red bus on it, and the Tokyo floor has enormous Sumo wrestlers (statues) trying to push one of the supporting columns down - lots of interesting decor to the theme on every floor - I saw that even the doorman at one of the back doors on the London floor was dressed like a Beefeater! Also great restaurants and lots of variety in the types of shops. And absolutley do not miss visiting the Gourmet Food Market in the basement - I discovered Peanut Butter Chocolate Brownies there, to die for! Not a \"flea market/same-same cheap tourist junk\" stall in sight; albeit some side alleys (as it were) with good quality but inexpensive shops. Very interesting escalator at the front door, that takes you directly up 3 floors (and there are also the normal 1-floor-at-a-time escalators and lifts too). A strange thing we noticed in many shopping centres in Bangkok though, was that escalators are not installed so that you sort of turn from one to the next going up (or down) i.e. you always have to walk all the way round to the other side, to get the next one up/down - absolute hell on hurting tourist feet! :-) And do not forget to go to the toilets in Terminal 21 - really! Because the ground floor and front entrance is themed as if arriving at an airport (and then you \"travel\", by escalator etc to a foreign country on the various floors) .... and the toilet is themed too! No kidding - there is, as in an aeroplane, a sort of \"control panel\" next to the toilet seat (wash bum, dry bum, etc :-) ) - so cool! Terminal 21 is linked by a sky bridge to the MRT station, so incredibly easy to get to. In fact, we spent f-a-r too much time in Terminal 21; when we probably should have been exploring authentic Bangkok more .... but Terminal 21 is quite addictive!"

The floors are named after the cities of Rome, London, Tokyo, Paris, and Sanfrancisco and even has a hanging Bridge on its top most floor. While shopping is expensive, there wasw good value at the Goumet market in the basement and at Watson and Boots stores, a few shops had sales but youd find them half the price outside the mall. What I liked was the food court with over 20 stall, all types of food, delicious and yet so cheap - starting from 15 Thb for drink to 25Thb for a main course ( nonveg), staying and the Kingston suites, we used to get dropped by the free took took and spent the 8 days that we were in bangkok having our lunch and dinner at the Food court..... great way to save money by not eating at your hotel or expensive restaurants....."

There are more resturants on the San Fransico Floor.The items on sale seemed expensive - such as the numerous dresses in Tokyo floor did not seem priced to the material/quality.

Apart from MBK, most shopping malls are very much the same with the same brands and outlets.Terminal 21 is not totally void of brand names but it is primarily home to small, privately owned stalls selling fashion items and memorabilia. And it's not all junk like you find in places like Platinum Fashion Mall or Bobae market.A lot of the shops sell decent quality goods and the clothing is of an above average quality and style but this is reflected in the prices being charged. A small toddler t-shirt was 280 baht !!, something that would have cost 50 Baht a few years ago and could probably be bought for 100 baht in the Patpong or Sukhumvit road markets.However, you can't find these type of t-shirts in those places and so you either cough up or move along.The suggestion that this resembles an airport terminal is pretty thin although a \"departures\" board and some signs to \"Gates 1- 10\" etc try to bring that theme home.The food sections occupy 2 whole floors. One floor for the food hall where you order your dish at a small booth and then take your food to a communal seating area and another food area where you can choose from a selection of restaurants.We were lucky enough to go during working hours and so it was quiet with kids at school and everyone else working. However, when lunchtime came around, the escalators were packed with people heading to the food floors and any hope of getting something to eat was dashed for a couple of hours.Terminal 21 makes for a great alternative to Siam Paragon, Central World and The Emporium but it's aimed more towards teenagers and young adults.We might go again next time we are in town but MBK is still our favourite.You can read more about Terminal 21 at http://thebangkokshoppingguide.com/terminal-21"

Terminal 21 mall is the latest shopping center in Bangkok boasting of 9 stories of shopping heaven.What\u2019s so special about this mall, is how each storey is named after a different city and promises a unique shopping experience for all who check in. Once inside the mall, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve stepped into the airport departure hall where each escalator leads you to a different destination at the next level\u2019s arrival gate. These are the themes on each level.Lower ground: Caribbean (Supermarket, convenient stores, services and restaurants)Ground: Rome (International brands)M Floor: Paris (International and Thai Designers)1 Floor: Tokyo (Ladies wear)2 Floor: London (Men's wear)3 Floor: Istanbul (Shoes, bags ad accessories)4, 5 Floor: San Francisco ( Dining)6 Floor: Hollywood (Cinema and IT products)Each level is dressed to it's theme and makes for nice photograph opportunity. Bargaining is acceptable at the mall, but prices here are more expensive than places like Platinum Mall. There are plenty of dining options from restaurants to cafes and even a food court for more affordable options. Don't miss the toilets as there are also different themes on each level. Overall, the mall offers an interesting concept and it\u2019s worthwhile for a visit. To get there, you can take the BTS to Asoke or the MRT to Sukhumvit station.For more photos, you can read the review of the mall on my blog: http://ajugglingmom.com/2012/05/terminal-21-the-latest-shopping-mall-in-bangkok/"

I loved the toilets from Paris.Stores are big universal brands, but there is several original stores. Fashion there is awesome. Prices are high for Bangkok, but still cheaper than in Montreal. Don't forget to keep your receipt for VAT refund if you are a tourist. There is A LOT of food places so you'll be in heaven if you're hungry!We really enjoyed walking around, there's plenty of things to look at, specially the decoration.

Now normally, I wouldn't bother reviewing a shopping mall, but to be fair, it's the best-decorated one I've seen for a while. Each floor is decorated to look like a major world city. The \"London\" floor has ... men's bathrooms that look like a London tube station, amongst many other things. The \"Tokyo\" floor actually has Japanese design features that are reasonably authentic, and they even wrote the Japanese place names on the posters above the shops correctly.Personally, there wasn't much for me actual shopping-wise, I think it's geared to a younger demographic, but it's worth a look if you're nearby just to see how a nicely-designed shopping mall could be done. Plus the bathrooms are clean and (dare I say it?) fun if you want a place to stop off briefly."

Each fun floor continues it's theme into the state of the art washrooms even. The Rome level reminds me of Caesar's Palace in Vegas, with white statutes, ceiling frescoes, Paris is so very Parisienne, Tokyo is pretty in pink in spring, London is very masculine with guy stores, and British symbols like street cars, San Francisco has an iconic Golden Gate Bridge that spans across the top of the building and has little cars on it even, Istanbul has colourful lights hanging from the ceilings and you feel as if you are in a middle eastern shopping bazaare. The top two levels have food courts and wonderful array of restaurants to choose from that are inexpensive. The mall is beautifully designed, spacious, fun to visit. Terminal 21 is easy to get to as the Asok Skytrain station feeds right into the mall."

I read a bit about Terminal 21 before my recent trip to Bangkok and thought I needed to visit it to see what the fuss was all about. The world cities theme certainly makes this place stands out from your typical shopping centre in Bangkok. I loved the scaled model of the Golden Gate Bridge on Level 5 where the foodcourt and restaurants were. This floor was admittedly the most popular and crowded level on the day I visited. The other floors, while filled with iconic signage (ie. Parisian street lights) and 3D sculptures (ie. Double-decker London bus and Japanese sumo wrestlers) worthy of happy snaps, the shops didn't have the same appeal as those found in MBK. It's a mix of pricey foreign brands shops and local designers stalls. The location is definitely very handy as it's connected to one of the BTS (Skytrain) stations in a popular tourist area.Is it a must-see place? Yes.Would I return next time? Probably not. I still prefer my usual spots of MBK, Siam Square and Paragon. I did find Seacon Square to be pretty good, especially if you have young kids. The only problem with SS is it's nowhere near public transport so you have to cab it."

Mostly, it is a destination of meeting spot, a meal and a photo op. Shopping is more or less patterned to the highly successful Platinum Mall, in terms of the small hip and chic shops of shoes, clothes and accessories. The prices of merchandise are quite high and seemingly picked out and selected, very up to date. There are still the regular store chain at the ground floor, to attract the brand conscious buyers. At the top floors are restaurants and cafes and a cinema. The rest rooms are great, each designed with a theme, visitors are even taking pictures inside but I won\u2019t go to a mall because of it. Parking is difficult and traffic around the area is atrocious, so consider taking the train. It\u2019s worth a look-see but I guess after the novelty wears down, shoppers will be back to the old dependable places."

Not so sure about the quality of the shops but the few I went into seemed liked western imitations and weren't particularly striking to me. I understand now why there are so many malls in Bangkok--because it's so hot all the time!Pros: Directly connected to Asok Skytrain stop so it's very easy to get to. Free wifi connection once you register at the ground floor information booth. Not all malls have this!Top floor restaurants have nice views although they are much pricier than the standard mall food court. But why not do it once for the ambiance?"

They just keep going up and up and up! The center really does have a very large range of outlets inside from clothing stores like Quicksilver, to a bakery (my favorite and of which was originally only found in Singapore but am very excited that they have one now in Thailand), named Breadtalk. Then, there are a huge range of eateries on two of the upper floors to choose from. All in all, it really is a nice place to visit and is actually convenient for me to stop by since it's right at a junction to which I have to pass by each day for work anyways."

An original concept with landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge, Frisco cable car, a British double decker or a London tube car.

Recent travel magazines have been covering Terminal 21 a lot, and it did not disappoint me at all. LocationIt's literally next to BTS Asok station. You should set aside 4-5 hours if you want to cover all floors plus eat lunch/dinner there. Bring a camera and spare battery!Selling pointEach floor has a theme based on a popular tourist destination - London, Japan, Italy, etc. Then there is the overall airport theme which ties it all together - e.g. now departing London going to Japan. The mall map is a booklet designed to look like a passport - but its been so popular that it's out of stock! I can't imagine how much money went into renovating this mall - all the decor and renovations are quite good quality and not tacky - refer to photos I've attached. I know it sounds silly but don't forget to visit the toilets on each floor - each toilet is renovated differently according to the theme country (actually even toilet 1 and toilet 2 on any given floor would be slightly different).There are lots of great photo spots scattered throughout the mall including:London - double decker bus, telephone booth, postboxJapan - Sumo wrestlers, lucky catItaly - Mouth of truth, roman pillarsSan Franciso - Golden Gate bridgeDepending on your luck there may be a small 'queue' at each photo spot but it's bearable. everyone is being silly and having fun striking poses.ShopsIn terms of shops there are both the chain retail stores and also small stores selling local brands - according to my travel book, some of the stores are from chatuchak and Suan Lum Night Bazaar. The top 2 floors are mainly restaurants - you will find a good selection there. In the basement there is fastfood, Watsons, supermarket.Overall Definitely visit this mall especially if you like taking photos. Then on another day visit Siam for the aquarium and Madam Tussauds. P.S. When you're all done, Urban Retreat spa directly opposite the street is excellent and reasonably priced."

It is worth it just for the air conditioning. The toilets are free as most other shopping malls charge 2 baht (which is nothing).

Easy to reach by Skytrain getting off at Asok.

London had a huge double decker bus with shops inside.Istanbul had huge lanterns hanging from the ceiling.The clothes & goods for sale were competitive in price & very funky, trendy etc. Sizes were probably a little tight for my six foot tall 85kg frame which is by no means huge but a little bigger than your average asian man.An essential Bangkok shopping stop off has been added.In summary, an awesome place to check out if only for the toilets!"

I have seen the future and it departs from Terminal 21.This is the latest of big shopping centres opened in Bangkok and it is themed on airports and cities. The spacious concourse can be accessed at Asoke (even side number on Sukhumvit) and if you have reached Asoke by the BTS skytrain, there is access provided on the mezzanine. Follow exit 4 and bear left to see the signage leading to the entrance at this level. There are nine floors inside and the crescent shaped reception counter is attended by staff wearing hostess uniforms inclusive of hats. A display above the counter provides basic information as to which floor corresponds to which city.As you step on the first escalator a sign above your head will read \u201cDeparture for level 1\u201d and just before you arrive another sign above your head will read \u201cArriving at level 1\u201dI am not sufficiently knowledgeable to say how long a themed centre like Terminal 21 will last but what I can share with you is that there are enough brand name shops and little boutiques to engage your interest for a few hours of your day here. In case you cannot wait, I will tell you that currently the following locations are featured; Caribbean, Rome, Paris, Tokyo, London, Istanbul, San Francisco and Hollywood.What made the owners and designers chose these cities over others remains a mystery, which perhaps another poster may clarify.On the fifth floor, you will find Pier 21, an excellent food court, where the food is freshly prepared and attractively presented and where the price policy is in competition with the street vendors so much so that sticky rice and mango is sold for 60 baht in nearby soi 11 but will sell at only 35 baht here. Bottled water is 10 baht and a coke and ice even cheaper at 7 baht. The top floor is overlooked by a giant reproduction of the Oscar statuette and aptly names Hollywood. I will be on a mission to check out their cinema theatre on my next visit. I visited last December on day two of my sojourn in Thailand and then again on my penultimate day and I already noticed that there were many additions in less than three weeks. Ah, and the toilet on each floor also follow the city themes with the cubicles inclusive of a \u201csurprise\u201d!!I intend to revisit it again when I go back in February to find out what else is new. Siam Paragon remains my favourite shopping place closely followed by Central World but it seems that Terminal 21 is a new entry at number three.

It is designed to look like an airport terminal and each floor offers a concept of famous cities, e.g. the first and second floors resemble Rome and Paris that offer international brands but the what makes it stand out compared to other shopping complexes are the floors further up (i.e London, Tokyo themed) as these floors offer local budding designer works from T-shirts, shoes and accesories. There are some shops selling pre-loved stuffs too. The reason I love the shops here is that the stuffs are being sold here are home grown and better quality (at least to the ones is MBK and Platinum) and reasonable priced too. Further up one floor (San Francisco) are restaurants, local and international.As the previous advisor mentioned, do make a trip to the toilets on each floor as it is designed according to the theme. I only managed to visit the toilets with Crabs-on-net (on San Francisco floor) and Tube Station based toilets (on London floor). Not your typical shopping mall, I truly enjoyed the shopping and also the design of this mall so much so, I made my second visit on my 5-days trip to Bangkok.

Oh don't forget to check out toilets in every floors since it's designed following the floor theme accordingly and could be cute in executions.A nice design touch to differ in a tight shopping malls competition around Bangkok :)"
