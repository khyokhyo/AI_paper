They separated the groups by language so you can enjoy! I loved the knowledge and link to Mayan history as well as geological knowledge. This is an ecological park so don't put lots of products on as you are in drinking water supply that needs to be maintained. Ask questions and get involved we learned so much!And now for the repelling! WOW! I was scared and anxious, but don't worry they walk you thru it step by step and there are safety precautions in place. This is worth the trip!"

            "review": "Cave was amazing, the price was not. I booked the Rio Secreto Plus tour for the \"cheap\" price of $99 USD. The park refuses to let you bring a camera into the caves, claiming it's for cave preservation, but the real reason is because they have a \"proffesional\" photographer who takes about 6-10 photos of each person/ group throughout the tour. At the end of the tour they try and pressure you into buying their photos for $25 USD per photo or you can get all the pictures of your group for $89 USD. Yes that's right, 7 photos for the same cost of your tour. Its a joke. The cave itsself was beautiful although not worth the extra money for the Plus tour. The light show is not fantastic and the bike riding is just a 500 ride on very old and unkept bikes from point A to point B so they don't have to drive you. Allow people to bring their own cameras... the people who still want to purchase the professional photos can do so."

            "review": "The brochure doesn't do justice to this place!. An unforgettable experience! We did this with three other couples with a very knowledgeable guide. First we walked through a dry underground river cavern. For the next cavern we donned wetsuits for about a two hour underground river tour through mostly knee deep water but at times over our heads. Stalactites and stalagmites formations were beautiful. At times we had to squeeze though tight passages but never had to crawl. At times we were able to float through some passages . To get out we went through shoulder wide walls and shoulder level water with our helmets rubbing against the cavern ceiling! There were no lights in this cavern so we only had our helmet lights. When the guide had all of us turn off our lights the complete darkness was indescribable. Most of us had no previous caving experience but we were able to put our complete trust in our guide. After leaving this cavern we rode bicycles a short distance to take turns rappelling down into another underground river cavern. We were able to walk out of this one. The physical exertion was not as much as it seems. Not to be missed!"

Our guide Vickey was great. If she is available, I suggest you ask for her. A very stunning experience and lifelong memory. Your about 65 feet below the surface into a different world than you have probably ever seen! You do some swimming (dog paddling really) and they supply all your supplies including wet suit, water shoes and helmet. The water is cool but you quickly adapt. A lot of walking in water ankle to waist deep but the water is so clear you can see straight down to the bottom. We did caves in Solvenia and these are 200\u2105 better. You have lights on your helmets but the guides have powerful lights to show you all the formations you will experience. You will also have two additional guides working with your main guide taking photos and assisting your journey. They are very safely conscious! You can't bring cameras but the photographers take some amazing photos of your group for you to buy if you desire. No hard pressure on the photos which is nice. We ended up buying due the overall experience which we rank as this trips highlight. Enjoy, this type of tour is very unique and memorable."

This area is full of subterranean rivers that sprout up into beautiful, calm and serene springs called \"Cinotes\" pronounced CY-NOTE-TAYS. The locals are correct when they tell you that the water is sweet. You can wade and swim in these nylon pools of aqumarine spring water with stalactites everywhere, hanging like chandeliers."

            "review": "Worth the Time and Money. You need to be in reasonable physical condition to do this excursion and not be claustrophobic to really enjoy this underground river experience. You first don a wet suit, already damp so hard to get on and then put on a hard hat complete with light. The hat is important as it is easy to knock your head on the low hanging stalactites (or are they stalagmites?). You also put on a life vest and swim shoes if you don't have you own. You wade a lot through knee deep water, the bottom is very uneven with jagged calcium protrusions below the surface, and swim in a few places where the water is fairly deep. The water feels chilly but is actually about 25C so not that bad. All the while your very knowledgable guide is sharing interesting information. To wrap it up a buffet of local fare is offered...after they try to sell you photos that have been taken throughout the tour (no personal cameras allowed)."

They have professional photographers that follow your small and personal group through the cave to catch every moment and make your experience last a life time. The ride to the secret river was entertaining and we even stopped to see some wildlife our driver was very fun and kept the drive entertaining. Even the food was beyond great.

            "review": "Intriguing and unique experience . We recently went to Rio Secreto with a group of friends and had a fun experience in the unique environment. As you probably know this location allows you the opportunity to move through underground caves via the water after putting on a wetsuit and a life jacket. Most caves require you to walk on the path that has very limited access. Safety is definitely a concern and they do a good job making sure that you're comfortable and in a safe environment. Here's a few things we didn't like. They took our group of six and merged us with a group of four and created a bilingual group. This meant the guide spent approximately half of his time speaking to the group in Spanish and the other half of the time speaking to us in English. This seemed to limit the ability for us to interact and ask questions and made it a less than enjoyable time. It would've been easy with all the guides they had there to split the groups differently as they had minivans of people coming in to take these tours. Another thing that limited our enjoyment was the drive in from the greeting spot to the point where the tour starts. It is a 15 minute journey through the most sloped and potholed road you can imagine. You arrive to start your tour in a fairly unsettled matter. From there it all goes smoothly they fit you they give you equipment and they get you going.Overall we liked it and we would not do it again but it was worth doing one time the caves are spectacular and unique and you get a chance to do a tour that I have not seen in my travel around the world."

Our guide Vero was absolutely amazing. Knowledgeable, funny, and efficient. They don't allow for your own pictures at all. Don't even try. It's good because it gives you 1) the opportunity to not be distracted while walking through stalagmites underwater 2) to really be \"present\" and \"disconnected.\" And 3) probably they'd like to make a few extra bucks. Can't blame them. They have a photographer along with each group so you don't lose those moments, too. And yes it's not free. The experience is completely worth it."

My girlfriend and I wanted to see the caves in a more \"personal\" way, it's not an easy find here but we did find this place to be awesome, groups are made of a maximum of 10 people only, so it does become somewhat more personal. Of course, if you are claustrophobic it's not a place for you. So, do yourself and everyone around you a favour and skip this tour. A bit of swimming is required but you do have life vest and it's a part of the tour that makes it so special, when you rest on your back and enjoy the quietness and darkness of the caves, I promise you will come out of there enchanted."

Staff was knowledgeable in caving and helpful in guiding us through - be sure to ask for Victor R.. Lunch was EXCELLENT (try the lime soup!). This is not your ordinary cruise tour to a beach or to snorkel. Be ready for a unique trip underground that was very well run. I would have liked to had time for their longer 5 hour tour, but the ship wouldn't wait!. On my list if I ever I get back to the area.If you sail into Cozumel, be prepared for a bumpy ferry ride to the mainland if there is any wind (usually is, we were told). You should be able to negotiate uneven terrain but the guides were helpful."

The tour is very well planned and you get to spend a good amount of time in the cave system. Our guide was Diana and she was funny and informative. We used the company's wetsuits over our swimsuits and purchased their water shoes (which was cheaper than buying them at our hotel). The photo packages start at $89, which may at first sound pricey, but the photographer basically was with us the entire tour and got some awesome shots of us going through the cave. We would definitely recommend the tour, and would probably even do it again if we got to do another route."

The ride in the tour vans was quick but very bumpy. Once we arrived at the tour location we were assigned a guide, given appropriate gear, and head off walking through the jungle to be blessed by a Mayan before entering the cave. The walk/swim through the gave was awesome. The information provided by the guide was great. The BIG NEGATIVE is they forbid cameras except for their own very expensive photographers. We refused to buy the pictures for $89 because we feel they are exploiting tourists by charging an unreasonably high price."

We wore swim suits which was perfect. The company provided wet suit, life vest, water shoes and helmet with light. Optional walking stick also available. Our guide was enthusiastic and knowledgeable. We went down into the cenote. The tour, about one and a half hours, consists of walking through the water to see various caverns, stalagmites and stalatites. At one point there was a very short swim, meaning between the depth and the stream and the life vest my feet did not touch bottom. Nothing scary, but just so you know. Another place was low enough I bumped my head twice. Glad for the helmet. Again, nothing scary. After getting back to the surface, we could view and purchase photos taken along the way and there was a light lunch provided. All in all, an enjoyable afternoon."

We were promptly picked up from our hotel lobby and taken to the starting point where all the necessary equipment was provided (helmet, wet suit, shoes, life jacket). Everything was in great condition and the facilities were spotless. Our tour guide, Alfredo, was amazing. His passion for the cave was infectious, and we really enjoyed learning about the history of the cave and the Mayan culture. Although English was not his first language, he was perfectly fluent and we had no issues understanding him. We participated on the Plus tour, which involved a tour of the dry and wet parts of the cave, and a short jaunt through a cenote entrance. Although we enjoyed it all, it did feel a little long, so if you're not crazy about spending a significant amount of time in small spaces, you may want to seek out a shorter tour. Overall, we spent 6 hours on this excursion. It was a whole day away from our all-inclusive, but it was well worth it!"

First we had a very good introduction to the Mayan world and culture and it's goods.After we went for the light show by foot (in normal cloth) for the first cave visit. Memo did a great introduction, we were only 5 in our group. After returning, we went to change (and shower off the deodorant/sunscreen etc) into the wet suit. We did bring our wet shoes, but the ones available were good too. Then the cycling (not far) to the entrance of the special cave. My daughter loved the cycling (also kids bikes available). then we went down 15 m to the entrance of the cave (it was just a great). If you are afraid, they guides help you, not probs. Then our journey started for more than 1 hour in the cave system. At the end we came out in the first cave visited and could walk back.

It was dark but we had lights on the safety helmets. The light illuminates the cave by radiating off of the crystal clear water. You hike over rocks and you have to wade thru water. Water shoes are a must. There are areas that you have to float thru the beautiful water. They provide a life jacket. The only issue is they give you an option to use a provided walking stick. The walk thru the cave and the water can be rough. The walking stick should be mandatory. I did not have any concerns about anything in the cave. The guide is very protective of the natural habitat. I am not athletic but was able to manage the cave. This is not for everyone but you don't have to a spelunker to explore this cave. They provide a lunch the is some of the best Mexican food I have eaten. The ride on the bus out was a little rough but the cave made up for the trip. I loved this and would do it again and again!"

            "review": "Hands-Down The Best Thing to do in Playa!. I found this hidden gem while hunting on Pinterest for ideas of things to do in Mexico. My boyfriend and I were staying in Cancun and organised the trip through Viator, so transport to the facility was included. It was a fairly long drive (over an hour) from Cancun, but definitely worth it. It is by far our favourite memory during the time we spent in Mexico. This off-the-beaten-path attraction is unlike anything I've ever experienced. After arriving, you're given a quick safety tutorial and then taken to the locker area to change your clothes. Lockers are provided free of cost. Swimwear is required and wetsuits are provided at no extra cost, as are wet shoes and a hard hat with light. Then you walk down a path and a local Mayan man offers a prayer on your soul - apparently we learned that they believe visiting the underground is essentially going to the underworld. You're given a walking stick to help you with balance and to work your way through the cave as you aren't allowed to touch anything (it will prevent future stalagmite/stalactite growth). The tour through the cave itself was probably about two hours long and included areas where you had to swim through, wading, crouching through tight areas etc so, while I don't think you have to be \"fit\" to do this tour, you do have to be comfortable with those activities. We saw fruit bats, baby catfish, some kind of unique spider (I forget what it was called). There was also a part where we all turned off our lights and just sat in the dark listening to the dripping of water. It was a very cool experience. Words cannot even justify it. Tip: book the earliest tour as the sediment at the bottom of the cave will be least disturbed then and the water is the clearest for seeing wildlife. Also, be prepared for the water to be cold (mountain rain/water cold), even with the wetsuit! During the tour, a professional photographer took our photos and you can purchase them after. Cameras, phones etc are not allowed on the tour. A traditional Mayan lunch was included in the tour after as well."

After that we were directed to a waiting area where we filled out a release form and were given some instructions. We waited for a few more people to get there as they only take you in small groups of 10 maximum. We ended up being a small group of 7 which was great. Once the groups are made they drive you out about 2.5 miles in a van through a small dirt road. Once we got there we were introduced to our guide and our photographer as you are not allowed to take any cameras. You are assigned a locker to put your stuff away. You have to take a shower to remove any sun block or anything in your body. After that they give you your gear and you walk toward the cave entrance. Before you enter they do some sort of mayan ritual as a welcome and for religious purposes they explain to you that it is just a welcome and that is it. Once inside you are able to appreciate every single detail of the \"secret river\" or underground river. Our guide was very knowledgeable and explained every detail of what we would see and do. I highly recommend using the cane or stick they provide for you as it is very helpful when walking underground to keep your balance and to feel the ground underneath the water. We were not lucky enough to see any bats but we did see some guano (bat poop). Overall it was a great experience, very unique and different to other things we have done. Upon finishing the tour you are directed to see your pictures. This is the only reason I am giving them 4 stars and not 5 because every tour you do they want to sell you pictures and of course they are way overpriced, they were not the exception. Though we liked some of the pictures and it would've been nice to have that as a nice memory of our tour, we decided not to buy. I think if they would lower the prices on the pictures a lot more people would buy them hence giving them more profit vs just selling some pictures here and there for such a high price. I don't think anyone in our group bought pictures. We were told you are not allowed to take camera as to not get distracted and hurt yourself and because the camera batteries are bad for the water, I personally think that is a lie, but that is just me. I just see it as an excuse to sell you their picture packages. Anyways, after that we were directed to the buffet area. Their food was amazing! I loved the different foods from the region they had available. The best part of it is that it is a buffet so you can eat as much as you can. After that they drove us back to the entrance where we parked our car and were able to go on our way. Summing everything up, you must go to rio secreto!"

You're provided a wet suit, water shoes, helmet, and buffet lunch afterwards. A once in a lifetime experience!However be aware especially if traveling at the end of of the rainy season, the initial van ride from the front entrance to the cave entrance is extremely bumpy. I get motion sickness easily and it was the only downside. Rough ride. Other than that, I highly recommend!"

It's only been known about for about 10 years so it hasn't been ruined by too much traffic and they seem to be very aware of keeping it that way asking us not to touch the formations as we walk along. Our family of 5 includes three kids from 13-10 and all were able to handle the whole trip."

You are not allowed to take pictures inside. They do supply a photographer to take pictures and charge a $$$ for them. He did a good job and its hard not to want to buy the pictures (we did). We were paired in a small group 6 of us total with our guide. We were all so amazed at our guide who spoke 5 languages (And I feel terrible for not remembering his name). 3 of the people in the group only spoke French so our skillful guide did the tour in English and French which was fun to hear. It is simply beautiful inside the cenotes. They do a great job of acclimating you to the water. You go in and then out for a while and then in. At the end of the tour you are in the water that is about 9-10 foot deep. It was so cool to see all the bats and creators that can survive in the dark under ground. After you hike back to the huts you are feed a traditional meal. All the staff were very nice and happy to answer any questions you have."

This sydtem was found only maybe 12 years ago! The property is large and well cared for. A treasure. Fall is great time to go as the water level is higher and you might hear the rain dripping through the limestone layers. In the winter you might be chilly when you leave the cave."

Those episodes are fortunately brief but so worth it. The guides are fantastic and make it very special. However, be ware that you are walking on the bed of the river and it's a little treacherous at times because you can't see well and there are a lot of rocks and drop offs to navigate. There are a couple of times they turn all the headlamps off to show how dark it is and if you have a child like mine that's a bit afraid of the dark it can be a bit scary. Oh, and to address the photo issue. No you can't take photos and I wouldn't want to - you really need to focus on where you are going and stepping. Taking photos would be unsafe and it is pitch black in the cave except for the headlamps. I don't think most people's cameras would get enough light from the flash to capture anything worth while. The photos they shoot are fantastic but very expensive. $25 for one, $50 for 3, or $90 for full CD of all pics. Very overpriced for mexico but no different than what we've paid for cds of white water rafting trips in the US. Also, what they do with the money is reinvest it in their conservation efforts which make it for a good cause."

Rio Secreto is an underground cavern/river in the Mayan Riviera, about 1.5 hours from Cancun, which is in the most pristine of conditions. The cavern structures and dynamics and water are simply and quite phenomenally beautiful... I'd go as far as to say \"beyond words\". The location and surrounding jungle is gorgeous and my tour guide Santiago was exceptional. If you visit Rio Secreto it might be a good idea to try and request him as your guide. The underground cavernous river is majestic and also quite cold. You will be provided with all the essentials for your trek thought the cave and this will include a neoprene wetsuit. Young children about 16 years and younger seem to feel the effects of the cold water much more than adults and young adults. The tour lasts approximately 1 hour 30 minutes and though young children do complete this tour frequently, they will be shivering most of the time. My personal recommendation is that you purchase and bring your own neoprene wetsuit shirt at least .5 to 1 millimeter in thickness if you are an adult and a full neoprene wetsuit for your young child at least 1 to 1.5 millimeter thick if any of you are sensitive to the cool water. However if you easily tolerate cool water they will still make it mandatory that you wear their wetsuit, so I still recommend you bring your own wetsuit. If anything, it will make the tour much more comfortable for all of you using your own neoprene. I also highly recommend bringing and using your own water footwear, otherwise it will also be provided for you. Use only non slip footwear that does not come easily off your feet. FYI, during this tour you will be mostly walking through shallow pools and moist cavern floor, but you will swim or wade trough some deeper sections. Meals and drinks will also be provided after completion of the tour. There are also shower, clothes changing and restroom facilities on site. The only thing I did not like about this tour is the fact that you cannot carry or use your own photographic equipment and thus are forced to purchase their own photographer's pictures at an exuberant prize or left with only the mental memories of this tour. The picture package will cost just over $100.00 US dollars for about 50 pictures whether you like all of them or not or choose each individual picture at about $25.00 dollars each. You don't really get to pick your backgrounds, angles or poses. Even so, the trip to Rio Secret is more than worth it! One more thing... For those of you who are hard core, very adventurous and in good physical condition like myself, there is a 5 hour tour of this underground river called the \"Privilege Tour\". This one is not for the common adventurer, and if you want more information about this amazing and deeply involved tour, contact Rio Secreto directly. Happy adventures!"

It's a long day and I wouldn't have been disappointed skipping the part after lunch and just relaxing in a hammock. Don't be afraid to ask to do that while the tour goes on.

Tour with hotel pick up was $99, they provide a video at check in and a shuttle to the prep area with showers, lockers and restrooms. Water shoes and wet suits with helmets are provided along with walking sticks. The sticks are very handy, when you're in the water, there is uneven footing almost the whole time. The guide will tell you the history, science and fun facts of the river and formations. The water is cold but def worth it, the wetsuits help quite a bit. The river we did, never got the name, did get very small at the end and if you're claustrophobic it may cause some panicking. You end the tour with a short walk back to the lockers, return the equipment, change then review your photos that are taken by an employee from the tour. They do not allow anything on the tour, can't take pictures, bring water or jewelry. The picture packages go 1 pic for $25, 3 for $50, or the whole set of all and 2 printed out for $99. They put the pics on a cd for you so it isn't printed. While the pics are being set up, they feed you a buffet on site which is salads, fruits, rice, cactus, pork, beans with some drinks.

The cave was absolutely breathtaking! We were able to see a coati at the end and interact with it before our buffet, which was also very cool. We enjoyed shots of mayan liquor after our tour together as a group.. a great addition to our journey. The buffet food was delicious and you really do get to eat as much as you want, unlike at other tours. I highly recommend this tour... the only thing I did not like is not being able to take my own pictures."

This was one of the my most favorites things I have done in my life. The swimming/wading though the underground Rio Secreto just seems out of this world. The natural beauty of the cave is spectacular and that coupled with the adventure of the swimming and wading in the water was a once in a lifetime experience. Leo, knew a lot about the cave and the geology and was very friendly which added to the tour. Rio Secreto has won numerous awards from Tripadvisor and other groups and they are well deserved.Even the hot lunch after the tour was excellent. This is a top notch activity all the way and worth the money. One note though, they do not allow any cameras and their photos are overpriced. $25/one or $75 for the tour."

No jewelery, watches or waterproof cameras allowed.Photographs are take at a cost of $25. These are available on a CD at the end of the tour which is not idea as they make a mistake and gave me the wrong CD. I only found this out as I asked them to show me what was on the CD... an improvement to this would be to email the pictures."

You will see the underground up close and personal. Floating thru the water and seeing so many different formations was amazing. I am not the most coordinated and found some of the terrain tricky, but absolutely enjoyed myself. We also had a non swimmer in our group and with some help, he did just fine too. Lunch was good and we did see them use a device to check food temperatures in the buffet line so we felt safe eating here. Also, I can't say enough about the customer service from Santiago in the photography department who allowed me to order my pictures after the fact. All around this was an excellent excursion."

We went on the Carnival Splendor and booked the Amazing Secret River excursion, it was worth every penny (ferry from Cozumel to Playa del Carmen, bus ride upon arrival from ferry to the location and yummy lunch was all included) Upon arrival you must put all your belongings in a locker, keys and locks are provided at no additional cost, you must shower, put on your gear, wetsuits, watershoes, life vest and helmet with light (all included) - Ones you're ready a Mayan ritual takes place right before entering the cave. Our guide was Gonzo, his passion is contagious, he's friendly, extremely knowledgeable, he made the tour and our time at Rio Secreto great, he even walked us back to the bus, super attentive. I was speechless, Rio Secreto exceeded my expectations, the pictures are gorgeous but this is definitely a must see for yourself adventure."

This \"experience\" is about going through a cave system 40-50 feet underground with a fresh water river in it, surrounded by stalactites/stalagmites with an experienced guide accompanying your group of up to 10 people.If you're not afraid of dark, enclosed, and sometimes tight spaces, plus wading, swimming, or floating on water, traversing rocks and clear pools, then this is an other-worldly experience unlike anything you can ever imagine. This is a once in a lifetime adventure, exploring the unknown, educational, appreciating nature, and having fun. If you're the adventurous type, then this is for you. Just please make sure you listen to your guide and you will have a safe and memorable experience."

            "review": "Must see in person!. I read lots of reviews and looked at quite a few photos trying to determine if this was something that would be fun for our group. Honestly at first I thought the photos looked cool but wasn't sure that it was mind blowing enough to spend most of a day on- was I wrong! This place is unbelievable in person!! The grounds alone are so beautiful with so many trees and pretty landscaping. It did feel a little gross to put on used water shoes so bring your own or buy a pair there. We said a little prayer in the woods to ask for permission from the mayans to enter their underworld which felt weird but gave an authentic vibe to what we were about to encounter. When we entered the underground river it was a little scary but so beautiful you forgot about the fact that you were inside of something that could probably collapse at any time. The humidity is high as you get further into the cave which helps offset the chilly water. You do a good combo of hiking throughout and going in and out of the water so if you aren't good with a bumpy road utilize the stick they offer you at the beginning. Overall I was so wrong about this possibly being boring/not worth a day off of the beach but it was an indescribable experience that is well worth it! The photographer took amazing photos of everyone of us so be prepared to want to buy them afterwards. Luckily we were a group of 6 so splitting the cost for the entire CD full of photos was only $15 each. They provide a buffet of food after the tour which wasn't spectacular but you'll likely want to eat after all that adventuring through the woods and cave. After eating you get to relax in their hammocks and shop at the gift shop. I would definitely recommend this tour for a unique experience that you won't likely have many times in your life! Ps: email ahead of time to book and they'll offer you promotional pricing (we paid $67 a person!!) and our resort set us up with a van for $20 per person round trip (taxi would've been 10 per person round trip but we had 6 of us so chose the van)"

Instead of booking this trip through a company we decided to rent a car for the day and drive ourselves which gives us more flexibility to explore the areas around Playa deal Carmen afterwards. We got there around 9.30 and got our tickets. This may represent a problem in high season but we had no problem getting in. You have to fill out a waiver and then they take you to the cave which is a couple of miles from the entrance. The road there is pretty bad. Lots of potholes etc. When you get there your guide will meet you and give you a locker key. Once you get changed in your bathing suit you take a nice cold shower. It will get you ready for the water in the cave. You are not allowed to wear jewelry or anything else for that matter other than your bathing suit. Also you can't take cameras. Waterproof or otherwise.Next you get your wet suit and water shoes. We had our own shoes. When everyone is ready you take a walk to the entrance of the cave. Just before you get there a Mayan man will give you a blessing. The cave is amazing. Some parts are very shallow other parts you swim. Our guide was very knowledgeable and interesting to listen to. The whole cave experience takes about 1.5 hours. A photographer keeps following you and takes pictures at varies stops or when you walk. I found that part a little much. But the cave is definitely worth it. At the end you get changed and go for lunch. But before you go for lunch the take you to the photo area. First they gave us a shot to drink. You can buy a bottle there. It was actually tasty. Then they show you the pictures. The quality of our pictures weren't that great. So we didn't buy any..Then they tell you the prices for different packages. A single picture will cost you $25. Then you can get a disk with pictures of the cave and about 10 pictures of yourself for $89 and the one with the the bottle of Mayan tequila was $109 I think. Lunch is buffet style which was pretty simple. Nothing special. Water and a couple of juices were included. Other drinks were for sale. After that you are done and they take you back to the top. The cave is 5 stars for sure!"

Seemed a bit high but since they added the \"gastronomical experience\" aka terrible Mexican/Italian that it would be close to worth it. The cave itself was pretty awesome. It is darker than the pictures make it seem as you only have your little cave lamps. You may want to bring another waterproof flashlight if you have one. This tour is not for people who are extremely out of shape or have a hard time walking for far distances. If you have trouble with hiking, you will definitely have trouble with this tour. I saw a few reviews of people complaining about the terrain, but seriously, IT'S A CAVE! (not an amusement park) YOU CANNOT BRING ANY CAMERAS! That being said, they do take professional photos and offer you about 8 pictures at the end for the low low price of 89$ USD...Are you kidding me!? So for the fun experience we have no pictures to prove we were in the cave, which sucks. The food was as cheap as it can be and they were so stingy they couldn't include cheese. Also the shuttle drivers want tips too...so it can be a very expensive place to go, especially with a family. Do your research and I am sure you can find something far cheaper than this as the Yucatan is FULL of caves. As a matter of fact there's a fancy restaurant in Playa Del Carmen that is inside of a cave. We paid less for four people eating, two drinks, and a bottle of wine than we did for four people on the cave tour...and you can take pictures! Take your family out for supper there, at ALUX in Playa."

            "review": "Great trip for whole family. We enjoyed our underground river adventure with a group of 8, ranging from 6-80 years old. Although our seniors are healthy, they are not confident with walking on uneven terrain, or steep grades, or swimming. We had Miguel as our river guide, and he did a great job helping our parents navigate the hike down to the cave, as well as within the cave waters and floating along. My parents had a great time, overcoming any anxieties they had, and we're glad they enjoyed an experience like nowhere else.We were given wetsuits and water shoes to borrow, as well as life jackets and helmets with head lamps. The water was cold at first, but we easily acclimated with the wetsuits and the activity. Without the wetsuit, it would be quite cold, so I strongly recommend taking the wetsuit. Lunch afterwards was also good, and despite being late in the day, we were not hurried at all.This was definitely one of the highlights of our trip, and a favorite of everyone from young to old!"

            "review": "Xel Ha Versus Xcaret versus Rio Secreto. Xel Ha Versus Xcaret versus Rio SecretoThese are all expensive parks and for a family on a budget visiting all three may be a stretch. So I thought ti would be helpful to give a quick comparison of the three.Xel Ha is all about the water and came in third on our list. It was enjoyable but certainly not as enjoyable as the other two. The snorkeling there is OK but not great. The river swim is thru the mangroves and we found it a little dull. There are fish feeding spots but get there early as the fish food will run out during the day and is not replenished. The SNUBA was good but was at additional cost. Also at additional cost is the sting ray feeding however if you are happy to just snorkel with the rays (i.e. not touch of feed them) then you can swim up to the edge of the feeding area and hang out. The rays will swim past you on their way into the feeding area. A good day but perhaps not worth the high price, especially for those who have snorkeled elsewhere. Xcaret provides the most variety and came in second. There are small shows thru the day and a major show at night. There is an excellent aviary and variety of other animals on display. The river float there is mostly underground and a lot of fun. You will fill a day here no problem.Rio Secreto is a one trick pony but it\u2019s a heck of a trick. It\u2019s really only a river swim/hike but unlike Xcaret the caver river system here is all natural and spectacular. It was our favorite by far. We had already swum in other cenotes however Rio Secreto was in a class of its own in terms of beauty. It also happens to be the cheapest of the three parks reviewed here. The only downside was that the lunch was average at best (as opposed to the other two who had substantial buffets). Unlike the others, Rio Secreto is only a few hours of entertainment (as opposed to a full days the Xel Ha and a full day and night for Xcaret). So if both time and money are tight, we\u2019d say Rio Secreto. If you can afford the additional cost, do Xcaret as well. If money and time are no object, then you can certainly add in Xel Ha.  "

            "review": "Chichen Itza Tour What A Day!. During our trip to Playa Del Maya, we went on a day tour to Chichen Itza. Little 15 passenger van picked us up from the resort and at another resort we transfered to a huge bus. Very comfortable. The ruins were about 2 hours away. Our guide was Beto, very nice, funny. Doing all the speaking in Spanish and English. Gave us a lot of good information on the land and the Mayan's. Finally got there and unloaded. Very hot day 90+ and humid! Pretty crowded but manageable. Once through a restroom break and the entrance gate we walked down to the heart of the site. Very open area, very interesting. Beto, our guide, walked us around to all the major things to see, explaining as he went. They had broken up the group to English only and Spanish only. The time there was a good balance of Beto speaking and time to walk where we wanted and take pictures. After this the group left and went a short distance from the ruins to a local restaurant for a buffet lunch. Good variety of food but quality was fair. Next to the restaurant was a fairly large store, with a variety of goods where we wandered through before leaving. Interesting to see pricing marked in Mexican pesos! Conversion rate was 18 pesos to 1 US dollar. After this we were taken to IK KIL cenote (say-no-tay) which is a limestone cave where the ceiling has fallen in. This one was open to swimming which my wife and i did. It was very crowded from locals and other tour groups. Water was about 57 degrees! We stayed a short time and got out changed clothes and were back on the bus from the 2 1/2 hour drive back. We did go through a larger town to see a very beautiful old church and square. We were near the last people to be dropped off. The tour guides and driver were excellent, friendly and helpful. If you are heading down to the Cancun area book a tour with Rio Secreto!!"

The tour was great fun and our guide - Andres - was excellent.On arrival we were split into groups and driven down to the entrance to collect our equipment. Wetsuits (optional), water shoes, lockers, lifejackets and walking sticks (optional) are all provided as part of the entry fee. You are not allowed to take your own camera down with you but this makes sense as you do have to do some swimming and walk through some tight spots. A cameraman follows you around during the tour but this was not obtrusive and there is no hard sell to buy them. As others have said they are expensive but you can buy individual shots for $25 each. A buffet lunch is provided at the end of the tour - this isn't extensive but it's nice to grab a quick bite to eat and drink before heading back to your hotel.We arrived at around 12 midday and were back at our hotel at around 4, so it's a great trip if you don't want to be out for the full day. Everything is very well organised and I would thoroughly recommend visiting here - You do need to do some swimming and walk through some tricky, rocky areas in enclosed spaces to bear this in mind before booking!"

Closturphobic or not we signed up. We arrived to Rio Secreto and met our guide Silas (Brazilian CPA gone tour guide) he made us (especially me) feel very safe and relaxed. He was amazing! He has so much passion for Mother Earth! He was very knowledgeable, caring, respectful, very approachable, patient, such a gentleman the whole tour ( he waited/ assisted every member as we passed through rocky , tight and dark areas. He had amazing data regarding these incredible hidden waters. He's a gem! The tour was amazing the meal was very nice. Silas went out of his way to introduce me to one of the cooks in order to get the recipe for \"cochinita pibil\" If given the opportunity to retake this tour we definitely would! I hope you all consider it if out in Playa! If you choose to do it make sure you take Silas advice and use the walking stick they offer, I would also suggest if you have water shoes take them with you. They do provide But they can be a little a worn out take your repellent to apply after the tour. They provide but for some reason both dispensers I tried didn't work. Don't even bother taking your cameras they don't allow themIn with you while on the tour they have their own photographer. Be prepared to pay $25 per picture. You can always opt not to buy the pictures...you will want at least one after you see the pictures. Our photographer was Jaime he was able to capture some very nice pictures! This tour is worth every dime ask for Silas if you can. "

The entire trip was incredible from start to finish. We were a party of 3 adults, my husband, our friend and me. A Rio Secreto\u2019s driver picked us up at the Moon Palace Resort Sunrise promptly at 7:45am. Our ride to the first stop (where we checked in) was about 45-50 min. After a short briefing they divided the guests in groups of 10 and we were lucky we got in a small Spanish speaking group. Our second stop was at the actual place, where we met our wonderful guide Jorge. He was amazing! He took time and took great care of all of us.He made everyone feel so comfortable and safe during the whole trip. Jorge was very knowledgeable about the caves and the formations and he was also very funny (saying: I\u2019d like you to see my \u2018office\u2019). He was able to answer all our questions.The river that runs through the cave was cold, but very refreshing because of the heat outside. The formations are second to none. I loved that there were not any lights throughout the cave. It is a relatively new place open to the public so I felt like an explorer. The only light you have is the one on your helmet.At one time Jorge asked us to step aside in a shallow part of the river and had everyone turn their lights off and stay quiet. You could only hear a few drops falling into the cave\u2026Incredible! The basic tour cost about $109 USD, but it is very worth it!! A professional photographer follows your group and takes awesome shots. They do provide a wetsuit (optional), a life jacket, a helmet with a light and, water shoes.Seeing those caves was something out of this world and I highly recommend this to everyone to experience. We all had an amazing time."

I was alone with my 2 daughters 7 and 8. We had Miguel as our tour guide. He was amazing! We couldn't be happier. Me and my 2 daughters were the only English speaking during our tour and we were with 2 other families that spoke Spanish. Miguel made sure to translate everything for us. He took time and took a great care of all of us. His English is excellent! Even at some point my daughter got a bit cold and he helped her out and carried her at the end of the trip in the water. I am sure it is not in his job description, but it was so nice of him to help. He also helped us to arrange the transportation back to our hotel as we took a cab one way. It was literally 15 min ride from our hotel Paradisus at playa del carmen. He made everyone feel so comfortable and safe during the whole trip that my daughters want to come back again and they are very, very picky and don't like everything but they absolutely loved him and loved this adventure. Miguel was very knowledgeable about the caves and the formations and he was also very funny. He was able to answer all our questions and he even translated the questions back and forth. We all had an amazing time. We did cycling and they had bikes the size that fit my both children and Miguel made sure that everyone was OK. Everything was so well organized. We did get hungry at the end, but the food was pretty good. The rappelling was so much fun. It was the first time my daughters did it and everything was explained very well and they felt very safe. We were with very nice group and everyone was so respectful, curtous and friendly that we couldn't be more lucky. It was a great adventure and great educational experience. The best place I would recommend during stay in Mexico. And if you could ask for Miguel, you should. And yes as many people say their pics are expensive, but seriously if you go to other adventures in Mexico $89 seems actually pretty cheap for all the amazing pics and for $20 more you get 3 souvenirs . I don't think I could get 3 souvenir the shirts for $20. Maybe $20 each from my experience. For example you will play nearly $200 for swimming with the dolphins photo package depending on how many people you are. It is not very different from other places like Disney, and it is such an unforgettable experience that it is well worth the price. I highly recommend this place to visit for everyone with children. We want to thank Miguel very much for being so helpful and so knowledgeable. Rio secreto you are lucky to have him!"

Also, after the tour we waited about an hour because they wanted to put people in vans going to the same place. Problem is that not everyone arrived at the same time and you are stuck waiting for latecomers. Total waste of time. Seeing the caves or cenotes was something out of a movie and highly recommend this to everyone to experience, but arrange better transportation to save you hours of waiting. Could be on the beach instead. Our guide, Jorge, was very knowledgeable and made the experience very beautiful."

Wanted a trip that wasn't too far from where we were staying in Playa del Carmen so chose Rio Secreto which was only 30 minutes awayPicked up from our hotel by their own staff and mini bus which was air conditioned and comfortable. One couple had already been picked up, four of us came from our hotel and then just two more from another hotel, so no time was wasted on going around a lot of hotels picking up.Arrived at the outdoor reception area where the friendly staff told us what we'd be doing. We were then taken in mini buses again to the caves which was actually 20 minutes on a very bumpy track into the jungle (this was the only part of the trip I didn't really enjoy but was obviously unavoidable)Once there we were allocated a guide in groups of about 14, given wetsuits, water shoes and helmets and taken down a short path to the caves entrance. The guide was very informative and helpful, pointing out uneven flooring and assisting where necessary. Walking sticks were offered and I was glad I took one as it helped with feeling ahead in the water to see where the drops or rocks wereWe were inside the caves for about an hour an three quarters but it flew by as it was so enjoyableAfterwards we were given towels and got changed into dry clothes and then had a hot and cold buffet lunch which was pleasantA photographer accompanied us the whole time and at the end you are given the chance to view and buy either all or some of your photos (on a CD)Transfer back to hotel was just as quick as on the wayTwo trips are offered a day 7.30am and 11.30am. We took 11.30am which was fine cos its cool in the caves so doesn't matter how hot the sun is. Got back to our hotel at approx 5pmOverall a very enjoyable day which I'd highly recommend"

            "review": "Spectacular Experience . We booked the 'plus' tour which involved exploring 3 underground caves, a 'dry' cave and 2 'wet' caves, one which required some wading. Our tour guide was Lucita who was excellent. We were placed with a Spanish speaking group. Lucita was meticulous about ensuring we were provided with detailed information in English about what we were seeing. Each cave/cenote we were taken to was progressively more spectacular than the previous one. The geological formations were stunning. Our time underground was a welcome relief from the heat and humidity. We had to rapelle down into one of the caves which was a new experience for my wife and I, all well instructed and perfectly safe. What impressed me about this tour was the genuine ecological focus on preserving this unique treasure and properly educating tourists and the local visitors about it. They have an association with National Geographic Society and are truly dedicated to preserving this site. This is not a 'tourist trap'. I felt good about supporting this venture and found the tour to be a unique educational experience. I wish we had our children with us to see this amazing place. I consider it a 'must see' when visiting the Mayan Riviera. Thanks again to Lucita for a spectacular experience. It was the highlight of our vacation."

No matter what the temperature is like outside, in the Cenotes its always a nice and cool so it is a good way to get out of the sun for a little while.Service and the guide was great. I forgot her name but she was a french speaking guide from Montreal. Suggestion: Bring your own water shoes. While they supply everything you need including a towel, for the sake of hygiene youo should bring your own water shoes."

The transfers etc went smoothly and we were met at the dock by our guide Veronica. We were quickly split into groups and we had a nice van with eleven in our group, six in our party. The distance was relatively close and a short Mayan Massage dirt section before arriving at the cenote. The briefing was quick and thourough and lockers, dressing areas etc. clean and uncrowded. No jewelry cameras or things you could drop or lose allowed. We were fit with helmets and lights, wetsuits and walking sticks and water shoes for those who wanted them. I have river shoes that are a bit sturdier so I used my own. Flip flops wont work at all and I doubt they would let you use them I chose not to use one and was ok but most people including my wife,4 knee surgeries, utilized them and they were very handy. You do not need sunscreen in the xenote so try not to use any and preserve the water quality. The hike to the mouth of the xenote is fairly short through lush jungle. No mosquitos today but I strongly recommend being prepared. Once we reached the xenote it was underground and in water the rest of the way. Crawling, climbing, ducking swimming but nothing a person in fair condition should have any trouble with. I do a lot of mine exploration, caving, canyoneering etc. and this was an EPIC experience. The tour and sights were spectacular. The water was cool and refreshing but not too cold. No cameras are allowed but a photographer accompanies you and took some spectacular shots. Veronica was very informative and patient as we had a non swimmer in the other family. 11 was a perfect size and we never saw or heard any groups until we were exiting the cave. The lunch was traditional Mayan fare and was good and plentiful. We purchased the pictures which were on CD and were awesome. The price US $89 seemed a bit steep but we split the cost with our friends so not bad. Unfortunately the CD did not work when we got home and I was really bummed but when I contacted the tour they got back to me within 15 minutes with a link and the pictures downloaded without problem. This was very impressive.Overall this was an awesome tour and the price standard for these types of adventures. Expect a lot of swimming and make sure to pay attention to your footing and if tall like me your overhangs. I would strongly recommend this tour and will do it again with my kids on my next visit."

Rio Secreto provides helmets (with lights), flotation jackets, and a wet suit that goes down to your thighs. The walking/wading part is on very uneven terrain, made especially difficult by the darkness and water. I suspect most of the eight people in our group, young and old, suffered at least some scrapes and bruises. So, I do recommend it for the adventurous types, but try to bring protection for your shins and feet, and shoes that are non-slip. The included lunch was excellent local fare."

It's family friendly, as my 12 and 7 year old children were able to participate. The ride to the site was probably the bumpiest ride of my life, but everything was smooth sailing after that. The walk through the jungle was nice, and safety was very important. Swimming in a cave, in clear water in Mexico was a very memorable experience for me and my family. The tour is about an hour and a half but that didn't seem nearly long enough - I didn't want to leave the cave! No cameras allowed during the tour and the pictures they sell you are VERY expensive, but if you want any pictures, that's the only way to go. I recommend this tour."

She is now happy to admit she was wrong and thoroughly enjoyed the trip.The trip was well organised (we were picked up from our hotel in a minibus and transferred to the main coach en route) and the staff excellent. Tours have no more than 10 people to a single guide and are accompanied by a professional photographer. Before entering the caves we were given a Mayan blessing (this is a sacred place to them).The caves themselves were magical and the tour was not overly taxing although in some places you need to take care. At 6' 3\" and as a not particularly slim guy I managed fine moving through the narrower and lower gaps so don't worry about size. I highly recommend this."

This is one of the most amazing things you will ever see in your life. There are a few limitations for those with mobility issues, so see it while you can. The only thing I would change is that the \"video\" they show underground should be nothing more than a laser-light show with classical music. They try to show the evolution of the earth, but it doesn't quite have the effect they are going for. The photos you can purchase are nice, but make sure you get a few of yourself away from the rest of the group.

However, the most important and magical part about this excursion is that you are exploring underground river and nature. During the excursion you will learn about the culture and traditions of the people who were living in this area. You will be surprised with the beauty of the caves, crystal water and bats :)After the excursion in the river you will be invited to take a bicycle ride to another natural entrance where you can try rappeling and the guide will provide you with necessary instructions. Do not worry about the safety. Just follow the directions and have fun!I think that this excursion is an ideal for adults and kids, Also, do not worry about buying or taking water shoes with you. You can buy them there. And if you do not speak Spanish that good, you can give it a try and join a Spanish speaking group :)"

You are presented with a guide for your desired language, gear up, and after there's a long and bumpy car ride for about 20 minutes before you get to the cave entrance. Not a very comfortable ride.You then spend around 90 minutes in beautiful caves with just your headlights providing you with vision. At one point you turn them off in the middle of the cave and enjoy pitch black darkness while everyone is silent, this was awesome! You walk and swim, and everyone are protected with a life jacket. Our guide Adam was very attentive and had a lot of knowledge.Food buffet was not brilliant, but OK.Cons: Your own photo equipment is not allowed. They say it's for safety reasons but in reality it's because they want to totally rip you off in buying your photos. A guy with a camera follows the group and takes pictures here and there. The photos are cool, but they charge a whooping $20 for ONE picture and $89 for around 15 photos. Way too expensive and not worth it in my opinion. Too bad for those who want to have memories from this beautiful place but have to pay more for pictures than for the entrance."

The more basic tour is essentially one cave tour. With the Plus package you get three cave tours, one of which you cycle to and then abseil down into the cave - a little scary but fun! Our tour guide for the day, Rene, was knowledgeable about the caves, Mayan people and surrounding environment and took pains to answer our questions, he made sure we were all ok with the more challenging parts of the cave tour. The whole day you are in the same small group and accompanied by a photographer. You can purchase a disk of all the photos or just select a limited number. A nice record. The caves themselves are beautiful and amazing. We've been to other caves before as a family but honestly this really is different. We were there nearly 6 hours before a very late lunch but the time passed so quickly we could not believe it was 4pm when we'd finished the last cave tour. All in all this is a fantastic way to spend a memorable day so leave your poolside lounger and get yourself down to Rio Secreto! All you need is your swimmers, they provide a towel and you can buy water shoes there (US$10 I think) if you don't already have them."

We had two young children in the group, one with adhd and he knew how to keep the boy happy when he was getting anxious to get out. There was a part of the cenote where the cavern was getting lower and lower and I think the little boy was getting claustrophobic. Valentino was amazing with him. The cenote are impressive and beautiful. You do have to be able to walk in the caves and swim. Water shoes are essential and if you don't have it they give you a pair or sell it for $10 USD. If you're claustrophobic then this is not the place for you. Everything you see is natural. No jewellery is allowed to be worn and we take a shower to wash off the oils and tanning lotions off to preserve the environment. You're not allowed cameras in with you and nor would you want to take it in there with you as you need to balance yourself on uneven floors in the water. There's a wonderful photographer that goes with the group. She is experienced and takes awesome pictures. Mind you the cd is usd$89 for all the picture or 1 picture is usd$25, 2 pictures is usd$40 and 3 pictures of usd$50. It was definitely a must see. Don't leave Praya Del Carmen without travelling to a cenote. They are special in this region in Mexico (Yucatan region). I am so glad I did it and I'm not fit but you do need some strength. There were grandparents on the tour but you do need strength. The tour guide will help you. Valentino looked after us really good. "

When I received the confirmation email, I realized that I had to print out the voucher. Fortunately, I was able to do that at my hotel. If you are thinking about going, you should do that from home. You have no reason to cancel due to weather because the tour is completely underground. If the event that it rains, it won't ruin your day. Its seems like they group together as they arrive, based on language, so the schedule seems flexible. The guide mentioned that they have 40 guides (who speak different languages) , so it seems like they wouldn't really ever be completely booked, if that makes sense.We drove ourselves and parked in the small parking lot. Fortunately, there was plenty of parking at 8:30 am. The official start time was 9 am and we were done at 12:30, for the basic entrance. If you take a taxi, outbound taxis seem to be readily available. Its located near Xcaret, just in case you are thinking about taking a taxi.The tour was well organized from beginning to end, and the guide had our safety in mind the whole time. He was very knowledgeable and passionate about the mayan jungle and traditions. In fact, his hobby includes researching the jungle.I would disagree with the reviewers complaining about the food. It was simple, Mexican food and it was delicious, especially after a 2-3 hour trek. We especially enjoyed the fresh tortillas, chicken and beans. Kids liked the pasta.It's true that the photos are expensive, and in hindsight I regret not looking at the camera more, because they turned out great. The cd includes really great stock photos of the jungle flora and fauna. They are better than anything I could have taken with my phone. The photographer was lost during one of the good photo ops, but it's ok because it wasn't her fault. We purchased the big package: photo cd + 3 items. They are very organized here. By the time you are done with the tour, all of your photos will be shown to you on a tablet. The items you can choose from are the RIO SECRETO t shirt, baseball cap, photobook or liquor (which you get to taste). We chose 2 tshirts and 1 cap. The only drawback was that we were kind of put on the spot. We requested an english tour because 2 of the 4 of us are not fluent in spanish. When we met with our guide, he said: \"Is it ok if I just speak in spanish, or do you want me to translate everything into english, even though it will take longer that way?\" We were kind of put on the spot and said that all spanish was ok, but please translate only the important safety instructions. We translated what we could to to the people in our party, but things kind of got lost in translation, and the 2 people in our party not fluent in Spanish kind of didn't get the full experience. In hindsight, I should have just told him to translate everything. But you can see how we were kind of put on the spot. My words of advise: bring your own water shoes and plan on buying the photos. Don't get guilt tripped into listening a specific language.All in all, it was an amazing experience! You won't regret it."

We sat at the air conditioned area, but the smell in there made me nauseous. The boat ride itself made me feel sea sick so I suggest either using a patch or taking a motion sickness pill. When we got to Playa Del Carmen, a van picked us up to take us to through the jungle. The ride was bumpy, but wasn't too bad. When we got to Rio Secreto, we were briefed on the rules and safety, then they provided us our wet suits, helmets, life vests and water shoes. Our tour guide, Pablo, was AWESOME and informative. The tour didn't feel rushed at all and the place was AMAZING! We were also provided lunch and drinks afterwards. The only thing I didn't like is that you can't bring your own camera. The photographer took some nice pictures, but the pictures cost a lot. The CD cost us about $90. I wish they would allow us to at least take a go pro. Aside from that, I would definitely recommend this to other people, both kids and adults."

Unlike Xcaret(which in my opinion is more touristy), this one has smaller groups, which allows the guide to give you more attention. We had a great time exploring the cave and the water isn't really cold, so don't worry about that. Just have to watch your step at times, but no one got hurt. Had an older gentleman who had difficulty at times, but nothing major. The food afterwards was pretty tasty as well! The staff is all very friendly and helpful. Definitely a recommended excursion!!"

Our tour guide, Daniello, made the experience even better. He was fluent in both English and Spanish and extremely knowledgeable about the caves and the wildlife of the area. Overall the experience was supercool, and unlike ANY cavern experience stateside.The only downside was that since we were on an excursion from the cruise ship, there was not a lot of down time to hang around the area after the tour. Regardless, this is a MUST SEE ADVENTURE!!!"

What I like most about this experience is that it isn't covered in multi-colored lights like a vegas show (caves like that seem way too touristy).Most of the time you're exploring through the darkness with only your headlamp. It feels like a proper cave adventure. Plus the walking (and swimming) through water. Even the most jaded adventure traveler who's done it all should still be able to enjoy this experience. And for anyone exploring a cave for the first time, you're in for a treat!"

We had the lovely Argentinean girl (sorry your name has escaped me) she was funny and very knowledgeable. We paid for the photo package, but felt when I was looking at them at the end that he could have taken more photos of us and the caves. I see a lot of pictures on here and we didn't get those ones taken. Got a rash later in the day from the wetsuit, it smelt funny too, like mildew. Heard something about rappelling down some caves, would have paid to do that, but didn't know about it. Enjoyed our time down in the caves, especially when she turned her torch out."

Unfortunately she was an example of how a person with no service vocation could ruin what could have been a great experience. She was more worried to finish the tour on time, than to keep an eye on our safety. At several points she advanced in the cave for 20 or 30 yards by herself, leaving us behind, and just waiting for us to catch up. We were traveling with two children (9 years old), which certainly made us slow-paced. However she never mentioned even once that there was an specific schedule to accomplish.During the bicycle part of the tour, we were also left behind maybe by 100 yards. In our hurry to catch up our guide, one of our childs had a pretty bad fall. We had to walk to the next stop to get some assistance. At that point she didn't know where to find a radio to call for help, she didn't even know where the first aid kit was located. For me this is just a proof of a deficient training.This caused a big delay on our return, which seemed to troubled the driver who got us back to the hotel. He drove really fast through a dirt road, passing other vehicles at high speed. When we reached the main road he sped up to 120-130 km/hr in a 80 km/hr zone.In summary, Rio Secreto is a beatiful place. I would just hope that the personnel in charge could have a higher standard towards the visitors."

I just visited Rio Secreto and overall the tour was good, but if you do a plus tour you will get to ride bikes, and the problem with the bikes is that the rode is rocky and the pedals are mostly broken. However, the tour guides are super nice but if you use the transporting service the vans are extremely hot and sweaty. I brought my own water shoes and I am glad I did because the provided ones smell like my dogs food and the wet suit smells like vial. I do recommend to use a walking stick because I even tripped on a rock in the water and the stick helps you see where you are going. The food is not amazing and I suggest not to eat before going on the van since you will probably feel sick. I bought the pictures and loved them, and the staff was great overall a good trip but there were a few kinks in the road."

There they gave us body suits, helmets, life jackets, and water shoes. USE A WALKING STICK it's so helpful when you can't really see the big rocks under the water and helps to catch your balance. You don't need to be a swimmer because of the lifejackets. The water is very cool like mid 70's but not a huge problem with the watersuits. Our guide was Alondra she was very funny and knew so much about the caves. She told us exactly where to step and made sure everyone was having a good time. She let us touch some of the formations and answered any questions we had. I wouldn't recommend this for big sized people or the elderly: we had a few tight squeezes my dad who's a little bigger than average could barely get thru. We had an older lady maybe in her 60's was able to get thru the rocks but she looked relatively healthy for her age and constantly used the walking stick for support. There are bats and fishes but they won't bother you. No cameras allowed but our photographer took great pics we got the package of all the photos and tshirts. The buffet had simple food but was great after working up an appetite from the walk. As we waited for the bus they had hammocks and plenty of sitting area while we waited for the buses. Do it!!!"

There is a 10 minutes ride from the main entrance of Rio Secreto to the place where the underground river is located at, be patience, it really worth the trip.Once at the venue, follow every instruction an recommendation of your tour guide, trust me, they know the place better than anyone and are prepared to help you enjoy at it most the activity and keep you safe while you are there.You will be amazed of what is underground in this region of Quintana roo, simply spectacular. Water is obviously a bit cold, so be prepared for thatAfterwards there is a nice buffet lunch offered as part of the tour (or at least the tour we got), food was very good, nothing extraordinary but not really important, what it matters is that the tour inside the underwater river is just fantasticI guess price might look a bit high but once you are there you will understand why, it s a total experience that you must have.

            "review": "Amazing experience . We booked our trip through the travel agents in our hotel. We were picked up by a mini bus at 8.45am and went to collect other passengers from other hotels. This didn't take too long. There were 9 of us on the bus and the driver informed us it would take 1 hour 30 mins to get there. Once at the location I used the simple toilet facilities and we were asked to sign a waiver. We weren't given much information and I think we were meant to watch a video but this wasn't shown. We went on a bus to the cave. The bus was clean and adequate for the journey. It is a bumpy road so if you get travel sick it may be worth taking tablets before hand. We met our guide Lara who was very friendly and asked where we were all from. She showed us where to get changed and provided us with a locker. The lockers were big enough for 2 of us and the toilet area was clean. We were provided with water shoes and there were plenty of sizes to try on. We then had to shower to get rid of chemicals. The water is quite cold so be prepared for the shock.We were then given wet suits and helmets. Again lots of sizes and good quality. Lara insisted on us having sticks to walk with. She did comment that they are optional but that she feels they are essential and she used one her self. It was great to see her passion for not only keeping us safe but for protecting the cave as she stressed that we shouldn't be touching the cave if we could help it and the stick would help us to avoid this. I really enjoyed the traditional Mayan ceremony before entering the cave. This was unexpected and a good tradition to experience. Once in the cave we were given rules and information. The cave was incredible. The water again was cold but you got used to it quickly. It was so amazing to look at and there was a good mix of walking on dry cave wet cave and to float in the water. Some people have moaned that there isn't enough swimming however this trip isn't about the swimming it's about experiencing the cave and learning about it. There are lots of parks close by to swim in the caves at your pleasure so that may be a better trip if your not so interested in learning about the caves.All the way through Lara kept us safe and showed us the best way your manouver around. She kept us well informed but also had a good sense of humour to keep it light and friendly. There are some small spaces, very deep water and times where it's very dark so it may be best to avoid it if you are afraid of any of those things. The buffet after was great. The food was delicious and was being replaced regularly. Some people mentioned flies, there were a few but then it is the jungle and that happens. They weren't causing any bother and the food was well looked after. The only downside was the photos. I felt there were a few too many photo stops in the cave that took away from the experience and then at the end they cost so much money that the quality wasn't worth the cost. It's a shame when you can't take our own photos at all and the option to just buy one wasn't available. 3 for 50 dollars is a little steep! I would highly recommend this trip and especially Lara who did an excellent job of keeping us informed, preserving the cave and making us laugh!"

You could tell that the establishment was trying to keep the river as pristine as possible; no outside chemicals or gadgets went into the cave. The base had everything you need for the trip. There were nice clean bathrooms, free lockers, many sized wet suits and life jackets, and helmets. The food afterwards was wonderful. We loved our tacos and fruit! We did purchase photos at the end.

It is quite spacious inside the caves, the water was warm enough and not even needing the wetsuit that is provided really. Our guide Paola was really amazing, excellent with the kids, able to speak several languages and she really made us all feel very comfortable. The tour is quite long in time but not really in distance, I am very unfit and I didn't have a problem at all. It is simply a wonderful thing to see, and to be able to swim in the caves and learn about how they formed. We could have stayed down there all day! The food afterwards is simple but delicious and the guides assist you from the start to the very finish of the trip with lunch changing, getting the correct gear on etc. Excellent. If we return to this part of the world we will almost certainly do this again. Just a word of warning - the 10/15 minute trip from the road to the caves through the jungle is incredibly bumpy and up and down hills - it is an off road experience.

The sales operator who I talked to cloned my credit card first with an online purchase of $5,000 mexican pesos and then with a hotel online reservation of $32,000 mexican pesos. So be aware of this situation and take your precautions.I bought the Plus Tour and I do not recommend it. I think its too long, a bit boring, and not worth the price difference. The lights show is not as good as I thought it would be (quality of the projection) and almost fell asleep while watching it. I recommend you only do the basic tour which will take you around 3 hours to complete. The water in the cave is very cold but you get used to it soon. The pictures are very expensive (89 usd for about 40 pictures) and you are not allowed to take your camara in. If possible, take your own water shoes to walk the cave because the ones there are dirty and smelly. Wear the water suit because otherwise you will freeze!!"

From the pristine water to the caves dating back hundreds and hundreds of years!I don't think the wet suit was necessary. However, save yourself the hassle and purchase some water shoes before visiting this attraction (though they are provided if needed). You will find yourself maneuvering over sharp objects on the floor of the caves.Also the 'Walking Stick' is a MUST!!! Most of all have fun!!!"

Gonzo is very knowledgeable and passionate not only about Rio Secreto but also about the environment. He led me down into the caves explaining the awesome site that we saw before us. I couldn't believe what I saw there, and now when I see the pictures of our group on the CD I purchased , I experience once again the beauty and solemnity of Rio Secreto. Thank you Gonzo."

            "review": "Must do for anyone who appreciates natural beauty!. I enjoyed this tour far more than I anticipated. I knew it was going to be great, but I didn't expect the experience to be better than that - it was fantastic! My family loved it! For those who have a great appreciation for nature and natural beauty, this is perfect for you! Due to the popularity of this tour, I was worried that the experience would be crowded and detract from the overall tranquil experience. To avoid this, my family opted for the PLUS tour. This tour was $20 more per person than the standard admission fee, totally $99 per person (if you drive to the place yourself). From Cancun to Rio Secreto is about an hour's drive so plan accordingly.Perks of the PLUS over the standard:- (theoretically) those who opt for PLUS generally don't mind paying more for a more exclusive tour- (theoretically) groups are smaller than the standard- Everything included in the standard- Dry walkthrough of a cave- Light show within the dry cave- Opportunity to bike through the jungle from one cenotes to the next- Rappel 50 meters down from the surface into second cenotes for more explorationSavings Tip: Check the website for discounts and promotions. When I scheduled the tour, there was a 20% discount if I made my appointment over the phone. With this promotion, I essentially got the PLUS tour at the rate of a standard tour, saving quite a bit!We scheduled for the 11AM tour since we were travelling from Isla Mujeres. We did not know this until we started the tour, but the buffet part does not happen until after the tour is done. So while we were thinking we'd be having lunch on the tour, it ended up being an early dinner instead. However, I'd like to say that the company who runs Rio Secreto does a really impressive job at making a well-operating branded business. The meeting area for the tour is clean and spacious with plenty of shade from trees and cabanas. All staff wear color coordinating uniforms for easy identification. There's a video presentation before everyone is escorted to a van that takes them to the next pit stop to meet their tour guides.After a 5-10 minute drive, we meet our tour guide (ours was Roberto who was so knowledgeable AND entertaining!) Roberto showed us the locker room where we placed all our belongings in. While you are allowed to bring your camera into the dry caves, you cannot do so in the wet caves. Your guide might give you the option of going without a wetsuit (so you're just in your swim suit), but I highly advise against it. The water in the caves are cold!We got wetsuits that are National Geographics branded so you know this tour has some serious sponsors! We also got a helmet with a light (you will definitely need this because you will more than likely miss a stalactite overhead and bump your head into it) and a life vest. Our family brought our own water shoes, but they can provide you with water shoes too.Before you can even get into the caves, you'll need to take a cold shower to rinse any contaminants off you. This is the same water you'll be walking/swimming in - glad you opted for a wetsuit yet? After a short trek into the jungle, we were met with a Mayan ceremony. The Mayan native asked the Gods permission for us all to enter the sacred cenotes as well as to keep us safe. After thanking the man, we slowly started to descend into the protected natural reserve.The overall tour experience was 6 hours and the time flew by! We were well taken care of every step of the way from one cenotes to the next. There was no down time. Everything transitioned from one location to the other so smoothly. There was never a single moment of boredom, hunger, or tiredness. Awe would be the most encompassing feeling as we marveled at the beauty of nature's creation over centuries.Roberto was a wealth of knowledge. He retold stories of ancient Mayan traditions and the science behind the cenotes' formations. While knowledgeable, he was also a funny guide as well, making the tour so enjoyable. There was never a dull moment while we were adventuring through natural beauty. Physically, this tour was not exhausting. If you are not on your feet, carefully walking through the caves, you'll be floating in the water with the help of a life vest (all the water in the cenotes is fresh water). If you don't want to participate in the biking for whatever reason, there is an option to ride a van to/from the next destination stop. For those who are worried about balance, there are walking sticks that can help keep you steady. All you really need to be mindful of is where you step and what is near your head.Throughout the tour, we had a dedicated photographer taking photos for us. Despite all the countless of photos here on TripAdvisor, I was wary if ours would turn out just as nice. Trust me - they turn out really, really nice. I have attached a couple from the tour at various points of our PLUS tour to depict that the photos are high quality. The cost, up front, is a bit apprehensive at $89 for all photos written on a CD. However, take the following into consideration:- These photos are undoubtedly nice.- Our family photos consisted of 122 pictures. 72 of them were photos taken at the actual tour. 50 are more stock images that they provide to showcase the \"best of\" Rio Secreto.- You won't be able to get photos these nice in low light conditions unless you have the appropriate expensive equipment.- Each photo is about 4500 x 3000 at 300 dpi- You just experienced a magnificent natural treasure! Why would you not want a memento of you actually there?!?!- Finally, take cost into consideration. I technically paid $80 per person for 6 hours of smoothly guided PLUS tour that included lunch and had everything provided for us on a silver platter. How can I not shell out a little extra for a memento to support such a fantastically run touring company of a beautiful preserved national reserve?"

The only reason I didn't is because they don't let you take cameras into the cave (which I fully understand and do not mind).. The cave is beautiful and the guides were very informative. This cave is one of the most beautiful places I've visited in Mexico. My reason for downgrading my rating is because of the ridiculous prices they charge for the photos. My husband and I also visited Cenote Maya Park where photography also isn't allowed. We purchased the pictures at both locations. We got 4 times the amount of photos at Cenote Maya Park for a lot less then we did at Rio Secreto. The photos you pay for aren't printed photos, just photos on a disk. I understand that a photographer is taking the photos but really. To give you some idea of prices they charge nearly $50 for 3 photos, $89 for all photos or $119 for all photos on a disk plus three items at the store (shirt, liquor, book, hats, etc.). If you're going to spend that kind of money you might at well buy the package that gives you the most. Prices are way too high and more people would purchase them if they lowered the price."

            "review": "on the way to being great. I'm writing this review from the perspective of also having participated in another tour (Jungla Maya) already, which means it's a little hard to not compare. First off, what you should know if you decide to go:1. You really only need your swim suit and a change of clothes for after the guided tour.They provide: wetsuit (if you want one - it's optional), a life jacket (not optional), swim shoes (if you don't bring your own), and a helmet with a light (not optional). *Wetsuits and life jackets come in sizes XS-XXL + kid's sizes*You don't need: camera (can't use it anyway), sunglasses (it's a cave), sunscreen (you are required to wash it off before you get into the water so don't put it on!)2. Once on the property there is a ~15min drive into the jungle. This is a BUMPY ride and there will be swerving involved as the driver tries to miss the potholes. If you tend to be motion sick, take something or wear a sea band.3. The water is chilly (~72*F) but not truly cold. If you don't want to wear the wetsuit, you'd be fine without it (if you're okay with being a bit chilly. Frankly you work up a sweat walking to the river anyway so you may appreciate the cold)4. The ground is incredibly uneven because it's a natural formation. There are many potential tripping hazards. They do provide walking sticks - USE ONE! (Even if you're in great shape it helps because it'll hit the unseen rocks on the bottom of the river before you do). The walk to and from the river is uneven as well. All in all, it's a decent hike - not terribly strenuous but enough to get some exercise. 5. The entire tour is underground - but usually in large caverns. There are only a few tighter spaces, so claustrophobia wouldn't be as big of an issue as you'd think - unless the idea of being underground contributes to it. 6. They provide a lunch afterwards - water/flavored water, salad, fruit, chicken & potatoes, rice, beans and tortillas. 7. There is a short blessing by a Mayan priest before you enter the water. PROS: Crazy amazing cave formations. Great guides. CONS: It's not truly \"swimming\" in a river. 95% is walking, with only a few deeper pools of swimming. My husband and I were disappointed by this actually. The transportation was a little disorganized when returning everyone to their resorts, the photographs they take are really pricey, and there isn't any \"leisure\" time to just hang out in the caves. In summation, I'd go. It's too cool to see nature look like that and not see it. However, Rio Secreto, if you're reading this, consider adding an option to actually float around in a cave or two once the tour is over. I would have loved some time to look around me at leisure rather than trying to keep up with the guide, or consider adding a tour that includes more floating rather than walking."

I can only hope they are cleaned each day but not holding my breath.Next you have to rinse off in an ultra cold shower before they will allow you in. If nothing else, this will prepare you for the extremely cold spring water you are about to get into.The formations are lovely and the spring water clear and beautiful, but I simply could not enjoy it for shivering so much.This is a must do, but only one time!"

We were given wet suits, water shoes and towels so you only need to bring your swimming costume. You get a life jacket so there no worries about being in the water and it's so clear and blue. You can't take any photos yourself, but a photographer follows your group and you can buy these at the end. You also get a meal and soft drinks. It's not a cheap tour, but a good portion of the entry fee goes toward education and conservation of the caves. If you fancy something a bit different then I would strongly recommend a trip to Rio Secreto."

So glad I did and there was nothing to be afraid of at all. Super safe, Kenzia went as slow as we needed to. They have three different routes that they can take - so you can just ask them to take you on the easiest route if you are concerned about difficulty. My husband and I are overweight and out of shape and we didn't have any problems. There are a lot of complaints about the price of photos but we bought them anyway because this was such a great experience. Also the photos are taken by a professional and are actually really good.

The guide and the equipment ware great and we really enjoyed the fantastic views of the stalactites and stalagmites and learned quite a bit about the formations.

The natural caves with the river running through it was definitely worth the trip. It is hard to believe that the caves are totally natural forming and there is nothing man made (except one set of stairs). I am a bit older and not normally adventurous. I normally opt for sightseeing tours rather than this type of excursion but I don't regret it a bit. Our tour guide, Alfredo, was also amazing and went above and beyond. He was so passionate about sharing his love for the caves with all of us. It makes for a much better experience when the tour guide loves what he is doing. Walking through the water on the uneven rocks proved to be a bit challenging at times (for an older adult who who normally doesn't indulge in this type of activity, as stated earlier), but Alfredo was a great help getting me through the caves and river (without a scratch). I am so glad that I participated in this excursion and that Alfredo was our guide. It was the best excursion of the cruise! Once inside the caves, you will just be awed! I also would like to say that the photographers did a great job! Personal cameras aren't allowed in the caves but they have photographers following the group taking pictures. Although $89 may be a bit pricey for a CD of pictures, the CD has about 70 pictures (about 20 of you/your group and 50 of the inside the cave and the other items of interest). I felt it was worth the money. Pictures look great but keep in mind that the life vest and wet suit (optional) will add 25 pounds to your pictures!"

Our group opted to hold hands in a single file line as opposed to using the canes. After reading previous reviews a lot said the cane was the best option. However my group wanted to hold hands. We all worked together in guiding each other not to fall and I think in the end it was better. It's amazing to see how Mother Nature works and the importance of preserving it!!! Buy the pictures they sell because they really capture the beauty of the underground caves. This was fun but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with bad knees or is claustrophobic. I consider myself to be pretty clumsy but made it out safe with bumps or scratches lol."

            "review": "Amazing Experience. This tour is really beautiful, peaceful, and fun. Our guide was Alondra. Not only was she very knowledgeable about the caves, but she was also hilarious which made for a very fun trip! You could tell she also has a very deep love and respect not only for the cave and its inhabitants, but also Mayan culture. There were parts of the cave that you could walk in, some parts you had to wade through water, some parts you can swim. There are beautiful formations everywhere and it really is just a great experience! Helpful tips: -The ride from the Rio Secreto entrance through the jungle to the caves is very bumpy! I would suggest taking some motion sickness medicine beforehand (even if youre not prone to getting sick), just to be sure. -Leave all of your jewelry, valuables, and cameras back at your resort (in a safe if you have one) because you are not allowed to bring them into the cave. They do provide you with a locker (which you will have a key to around your neck for the tour), but it is just easier to not have to worry about it. Bring water shoes if you have them! They can provide you with some, but I can't remember if you had to pay for them or not. - You will have to wash off any chemicals (bug spray, sunscreen, etc) off of your body before entering the cave to protect the waters that feed into the reef. It is just easier to not have anything on prior to arriving. I was super worried about mosquitoes (b/c of Zika), but neither myself or my husband were bit. We tried to schedule for a mid-day tour (12:00 PM) so we could avoid any morning or evening mosquitoes. I did bring some natural citronella bug spray and we applied it after we got out of the cave. -The photo package is around $90 for a CD with all of your photos. I would just factor this price into the total for your trip beforehand, so you aren't surprised with a big bill later. Of course, you don't have to get the photo package, but I am sure you will want the pictures after!Notes:-I was worried that I would be cold the entire trip (as I am always cold! Haha), but I was totally fine! The water is only cool when you are completely swimming and even then its only cool and not cold. -I ate all of the food they provided (even the salad) and did not get sick, so I would not worry about the food."

The caves were very neat and floating through the parts that were deep was such a cool experience. Our tour guide (Benito) was so knowledgeable and helpful. We all wished we could have played around in the pool just a little more at the end, but it was nice. The outdoor lunch afterwards was very cool too. The photos they took of us were amazing but WAY overpriced...still kind of sad that we didn't buy any though."

You will learn all about the history and people, but the best part was exploring the cave; being in the water was awesome! They give you helmet, water shoes, wet suit, and vest. They really took their time to make sure you had a good experience! The ride in the van was a little scary, because we didn't know where we were going, all dirt roads a little creepy. But once you are there it was awesome. I can't say enough about this trip, do something out of the ordinary, you won't regret it!! We are going back again next year..can't wait!"

            "review": "Beautiful tour and awesome tour guide!!. My family and I completely enjoyed our tour of Rio Secreto! The whole day was so exciting and filled with adventures! We were picked up from Moon Palace in the morning and headed off to Playa del Carmen in a comfortable van. We took part in the Rio Secreto Plus tour, and at a little past 10 a.m., we arrived and were given a brief introduction and we were assigned to Santiago, our awesome and knowledgeable tour guide! There were only 10 people in our group so it was a perfect group size. For a little over an hour, we explored a dry cave where we participated in sacred Mayan rituals, watched a mesmerizing sound and light show, and walked around listening to Santi's in-depth knowledge of the history of the peoples and the area. It was cool to see the sound and light show because it was like watching modern technology on a huge, ancient backdrop of rocks and stalactites that are several thousands of years old.Then, we took our bicycles through the jungle for about half an hour and went to the rappelling site. The rappelling was a little over 50 meters and it was our whole family's first time but we all loved it! Dani and Pablo, the rappelling guides, made us feel very safe too! Plus, the water was very cool and refreshing at the bottom of the cenote.Then we bicycled back to the meeting area and got our wetsuits and gear and headed off to Santi's \"favorite route.\" This route is called \"Allegro,\" which means happiness, and the inside of the cave was huge! If you have claustrophobia, I think this route is for you because there wasn't a single tight space that I could remember. Here, Santi talked about the geography of the stalactites and stalagmites, how the Yucatan peninsula was formed, and more. Of course there were more things but I won't spoil it all for you! We also briefly experimented being in the caves in complete darkness, which was awesome, and we finished off with the floating part, where we float through the cave until we hit the end! It was truly a magical experience. The whole tour including the lunch buffet ended at around 4:30 p.m. and I was so sad to say goodbye.There is also a photographer who follows each group, and our photographer Anna was always one step ahead of us to capture amazing pictures of us! We aren't allowed to bring cameras into the caves, but honestly I think this policy is better because it would have been too distracting to take pictures because the sights are breathtaking and it's better to be in the moment for these kinds of activities. Plus, the caverns are dark so constant flashes from other people's cameras would also have been distracting too!Couple of notes: Apparently visiting Rio Secreto is a great rainy day activity because apart from the bicycle ride, everything is pretty much underground. It's perfect for those days when you can't go to the beach! As for us, we went when it was pretty hot outside and the water from the caves cooled us off all day.Also be sure not to wear any sunscreen, even the biodegradable ones, because the oils will spoil the natural waters and alter its composition. Plus, as I mentioned earlier, most of the activities are underground and there are a lot of trees and natural shade so you don't need it. And they will make you take it off if you have trace amounts of sunscreen so don't even think about it! Also, make sure you have a big breakfast because these activities will make you hungry and you obviously can't carry food into the underwater cave so I found that it's best to come in a full stomach! They do offer a delicious lunch buffet with traditional food, but depending on the time of your tour and which activities you do first, you might not get to eat until a couple hours after the tour starts.Last but not least, definitely ask for Santiago! He was so thorough with explaining the geography and history of the caves, the Mayan people, and more! We learned so much from him. He was always on the lookout for us during each activity and making sure we were safe. Also, he is very caring about the environment and it was nice to be a part of his goal of educating visitors on preserving these natural wonders! Overall, Santi made this experience unforgettable and our family cannot thank him enough! I definitely recommend this excursion to everyone visiting Cancun!"

She was great with explaining our gear and helping us put it on. We went in a group of 10 and she remembered all of our names! Prior to entering the caves, we did a Mayan ritual that really puts into perspective how sacred and monumental these caves are. The caves were beautiful. Alondra shared her knowledge and the history of all the formations. It was truly an intriguing experience! Afterwards, we were taken to our Mayan meal, which was delicious! Also, they do have photographers that take you photo during the excursion for urchase after you're done. Highly recommend this excursion and ask for Alondra, or Juanita, as she sometimes goes by it! lol"

She was very friendly and informative and was able to efficiently communicate with both english and spanish speaking individuals. Is a bit pricey compared to some of the other cenote sites in the yucatan penninsula, but is a fair price for what you get. They will provide wetsuits, water shoes, storage, and helmet w/ light free of charge. Cannot bring much else besides a bathing suit, but for good reason. The team at Rio Secreto does a fabulous job stressing the importance of preserving the fragile underground cenote, but without sacrificing quality. They also had a dedicated photographer with each tour group for multiple 'paparazzi' shots. You may purchase the photos afterwards, but for a price. A little steep in my mind but about on par with any theme park in the US. They fed us a nice lunch at the end and then did a great job coordinating transport home. Would definitely recommend this service to travelers looking to explore mexicos natural wonder."

Both of these experiences were amazing. Swimming through the underground cave system was really a special experience. The lowlights: to buy all pictures was $85 USD, $50 USD for 3 pictures, or around like $29 USD for 1 picture. The provided water shoes were not the greatest quality and I would suggest bringing your own water shoes/chacos/etc, but water shoes were provided at no cost to us. The wet suits and gloves for rappelling that were provided did have a musty smell to them, and the wet suit provided did not fit a tall person above 6'3 (bummer). We were satisfied with the food at the end. Transportation provided from entrance to caves/trails was fine but the road was an un paved \"country\" road which we had no problem with. Overall, we were highly satisfied with experience but just cannot give this place 5 stars b/c just too many things were missed or had an opportunity to improve during the tour."

Really enjoyed this - with a guide and ten other people you walk for an hour or two through interconnecting underground caves - you are well taken care of with water shoes, a wet suit, life preserver and hard hat with a light. Accept the walking stick they offer - you will need it to keep your balance on the uneven river floor. Not for those who have trouble walking on uneven ground - or for those who need to sit down and rest. This excursion has received the National Geographic for excellence for the last 5 years. It's worth the $109 US"

Then they dont let you take picture in the cave, ... for they will tell you its for security reason or any reason they found. But no its just to scam you more money at the exit at 69 USD for the picture.i go ther to keep souvenir of my way to see end enjoy this cave, the fact that i cant take my picture the way i whant the way i enjoye this verry nice place... yes its amazing. i was turn off about this no picture policy. and then the carzy price they ask for one CD of not really good picture. juste picture of me, really i can found my face every morning in the mirror. When you go to other activity you can see they put a lot of money for the attraction, Rio Secreto they found one million years old cave and charge you to go... was free for theme. the price should be better and allow us to take picture in a particular moment, few time during the visite be creative, not all about moeny, and please, creat one buffet with choice, if not call this free meal not buffet.Sorry for Rio Secreto you miss the point, you miss it when you ask so much money for picture and this policy of no pics, you miss it all. Sad because its a place you must see in your life."

I will start out by saying this is completely underground and there are no lights or openings of any kind, besides the flashlight of the guide and your headlamp. The pics kind of made it look like there was lighting to me but that was just the flash. There are a lot of uneven surfaces and blind step ups that you have to walk through and you have to bend down to duck under some of the formations so I would highly recommend taking the walking stick they offer. The views of all of the crystal formations were incredible! Our guide was Roberto and he was very informative and gave us a great tour. The buffet after was nothing too special but was pretty tasty. Overall I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to experience a Cenote in Playa del Carmen!"

Throughout the tour a photographer will take your photos as you are not allowed your own camera in. At the end they wanted 90.00 for a photo CD of everyone or 25.00 for a single photo. They refused to barter on their crazy prices. We intended on buying the photos if they were more reasonable but we're turned off and spent no money instead. After going back to our resort we had several friends ask us about the experience which were told about their photo prices and chose not to book the excursion because of this. If you make photos 10.

Pablo was a superb guide throughout. You are not allowed to take cameras or wear dangly jewelry and must rinse off prior to entering the cavern. Lockers are provided. Wet suits, water shoes, helmets with lights, and water shoes are provided- all in good condition. There is a bit of a walk through rain forest prior to reaching cavern entrance. No fixed lighting in the cavern - all light is from your helmet lights and Pablo carried a flashlight to point out things of particular interest. No rales - you walk on the uneven cave floor mostly in water. Walking sticks are also provided and good for me to have one. There are portions of the cavern passage where you must literally swim. It is a beautiful and memorable experience. Our excursion included a buffet lunch of local food. From Cozumel pier you must take a 40 minute ferry ride to mainland (caution to those prone to motion sickness) and then about 30 minutes on bus to cave site."

We asked him to expand the tour to include more comments on flora, fauna before and after the caves. He did and, during the lunch break, showed us recent clips from wildlife cameras (Deer hunters: think trail cameras) showing jaguars and other native wild animals. The cave experience was incredible. We saw stalactites and stalagmites galore, with much geological and paleological background. We highly recommend the tour. Do a Google search to find best rates ... they will typically price match."

The bus ride was approximately 30 mins from our hotel, we arrived at Rio Secreto and filled in some forms and were then put into groups, the drive to actual caves was a bit bumpy and takes a bit of time. Our guide was a young lady called Kazia, she was really knowledgeable and gave us plenty of information about the caves, Mayan people, jungle etc. Our group of 9 had all opted for the PLUS experience which involved a walk through a dry cave with a fantastic projection show on the cave walls, from here we changed into swimsuits, wet suits and helmets ( we had our own water shoes but they were available to anyone who needed them ). A locker is available for your valuables and a towel is given to you at this point to put in the locker, cameras are prohibited in the caves. We then made our way to the second cave on pedal bikes ( very hot and bumpy but good fun). We rappelled/abseiled about 45 feet into the cave, first time for me, loved it, sheeing the rest of the group's head torches pointing up at you was a bit eerie, the water was pristine and cool, appealing after the 30-32 degrees above ground. We walked through this cave, the water was only about thigh level, quite spectacular to see all the formations, Kazia explaining as you go along. A set of stairs takes you back out into the daylight, from here we cycled to another area where we had some refreshing fruit and water, got life jackets on and walked into a different section of cave. Swimming was involved a couple of times here, quite deep in places, at one point the 10 of us sat in shallow water in complete silence with all torches off, wow, you need to experience it, quite incredible. A photographer joins you throughout taking pics that can be purchased, this was probably the only negative comment, the cost was quite hefty, 1 pic $25, 2 pics $40, 3 pics $50 or about 10-12 pics for $89, we opted for 1 pic ( needed some evidence of the abseil) ...Think more people would purchase pics if they were better priced.A buffet meal was also included, the soup was great but the rest was just average. There's hammocks dotted around to relax while waiting for your return transport.Do eat before doing trip, it's a while before you have anythingDo bring $ or pesos to tip the guideDo take the cane on offer to help stabilise you, some sections can be trickyDo allow the whole day for the PLUS trip, we left at 8am and returned at 4pmDon't take cameras into the cave.Fantastic experience overall, would definitely recommend it."

The cave was spectacular. I've visited a lot of caves over the years. I've visited the cave at Great Basin National Park, the cave at Timpanogos Cave National Monument, and this cave in Mexico is COOL!!! Part of the attraction is that we were both in and out of the water wearing wet-suits. Outside of the cave in the above portion of the resort is a nice area for relaxing with hammocks and such. The changing facilities are clean and seemed relatively secure. Oh, I wouldn't put jewelry in the little wooden closet that they give each person, but it seemed OK to leave my wallet there.If I had to find something to complain about, it is that they don't allow you to take your own camera into the cave. So, you are basically forced to purchase at least one photo so that you have something to show your friends back home. And, that is what we did. We were strong and purchased a single photo so that we had something to E-mail people make them jealous. :-) Nobody would have wanted to see 20 photos of us in the cave. But a single photo is probably worth it. Just my thoughts on the subject."

Some areas were tight, some areas we were in deep water, and some areas were rocky and slick, so make sure this sounds like your kind of adventure. My wife and I thought it was amazing and highly recommend it. Tour guide Diana was very informative and clearly knew her stuff. After about 1.5 hours, we had an authentic buffet of Mexican foods which was actually quite tasty. After lunch we were brought back out of the jungle for about 2 hours to shop or walk the beach or whatever. This was wasted time, however. Most of us wanted to head back to Cozumel but we had to wait for the ferry and thus had no time in Cozumel. Overall the trip was fantastic but I'd recommend them bringing everyone back immediately following lunch."

Guides are knowledgeable and friendly. Couple of things to note. If you purchase a trip to Rio Secreto through one of the agencies and it includes food, the food will be mediocre at best. The transportation is decent, not ideal, since they are trying to fill the van before it departs, especially on the way back and it may take time and some commotion will happen. Pictures will be professionally done and expensive and you cannot take your own."

            "review": "Amazing caves, wonderful experience!. I absolutely loved the Rio Secreto tour. Our guide, Alfredo, was fantastically informative, fun, and took very good care of us. The experience is right up my alley - a fun, and not overly difficult hike/float through an extensive cave system for about an hour and a half. The caves just go on and on - it was fun pointing the helmet flashlight down a side cavern and wondering where it went. At one point, we all turned off our lights and just floated in the darkness, which was a cool experience. At another, we spotted some fresh green shoots growing in the absolute darkness underground, to our surprise. The experience of coming out of the cool, comfortable cave into the hot, humid jungle, and seeing what a thin layer of rock and soil separated the lush jungle from the caves below was surreal. I absolutely recommend the experience.Logistically, they provided everything we needed - show up in a bathing suit but no sunscreen, insect repellants, creams, etc (they'll have you shower before going to the caves) so as not to pollute the water. They provide helmets, lights, life jackets, water shoes, and optional wetsuits (not a bad idea). There are bathrooms with small changing stalls and lockers provided. No cameras allowed, but each group is accompanied by a professional photographer with the option to buy the photos afterwards (which contain a mixture of individual shots walking through the caves, posed group shots, and occasional shots that really capture the caves themselves). The actual caves are a bumpy 10 min(? didn't really time it) van ride down dirt roads from the parking area."

This is a unique experience where you tour caverns in a wet suit with hard hat and head lamp. You not only walk through the cavers but swim in them. We had a fabulous guide, Daniele, and were impressed with his knowledge of the caverns and surrounding area. We appreciated how in tune is was with nature. It's gotten a bit more commercialized since 2008 but still a fabulous tour! We will definitely return whenever in Cancun!"

The guides know the layouts of the caves very well so they can navigate you through them safely. You're in the caves for about an hour and a half, so it's well worth the money. Once your tour of the caves is complete they provide lunch for you. The food is cooked by local Myans and was the best food I had on the whole trip. This is definitely a must see if you visit Playa del Carmen."

But Miguel held my hand to navigate the precarious trek.Suddenly,(I have been told) I had a seizure. Miguel,apparently not just a tour guide. But, highly trained for emergency situations, let into action. To make a horrifying, long story short. Miguel stayed with me through out the entire ordeal all the way to the hospital. And stayed until I was stable. I even just received an email from him. Asking how I was. I am at loss of words about this young man.So, if you are planning a trip to Rio Secreto. Rest assured you are in very good hands!!!!I am so grateful to Miguel,and his staff for saving my life!"

It was one of our highlights on the trip. However, there is NO snorkeling, diving or swimming here. Some floating. You are provided a spring suit, vest, booties, helmet and headlamp. It can be a little tricky & require some concentration navigating where you step in the water with an uneven bottom. Hint: Don't feel shy or embarrassed using a walking pole(offered where you suit up). Our guide, though new, seemed knowledgable and was enjoyable. The provided lunch was nice. Here's where I'd take 2 points away...Our young photographer, was inexperienced & horrible. Most of the pictures were blurry. Our group consisted of 8 people, and the photographer wanted $400 for a group purchase or $40 per picture!!! He was indignant when we asked for a reduced price. Also, overheard another photographer in a different group charging a lesser overall & individual price. What the what?! I hate the feeling of being ripped off. It left a poor taste in our mouth and reputation on the company. (P.s.- Our resort had pro photographers on site who edit and give you pics at $25 ea if that gives you any idea.) Remedy: though they frown on bringing your own camera, IF you have a small waterproof with a flash(necessary) or GoPro, tuck it in your vest or leg of your wetsuit and use it, I say. You paid for the trip and it's not illegal to take pictures, especially if you take responsibility of your own camera. :)Overall, the company was well organized and friendly...as long as you stay away from the photos."

That being said, it was really awesome!! Honestly it is something you would probably never do any other time. The guide, Alondra, was awesome. Her English was really good. She was funny , entertaining and very caring. She made sure we were all safe and knew what was going on ahead of time. You wear a life jacket ,a wet suit, water shoes and a helmet that are provided to you. You are also provided a locker which you keep the key to so your belongings are safe. The water was not over our heads. They say the temp of the water is 77, It sure seemed colder, but it was very warm outside so it may have just seemed that way. The tour goes through the caves with just a head lamp and the guides flashlight. This really made the trip extra special.. no electric lights. We love caves so this was riight up our alley. If you are claustrophobic this may not be for you. You cannot take your phones or cameras inside. They take a LOT of pics and then sell them to you. $25 for one , $40 for two... we didn't buy the photos. Definately worth going to as it was really was something special that you probably won't do somewhere else."

The process to get from the ship to Rio Secreto was seamless thanks to Addy and once we got there our tour was led by Julian who was fantastic. The prices for the pictures were reasonable and there was no pressure to buy. Food was great too! Of course the caves were amazing. It's not something you can describe and the pictures do not do them justice! It's something you definitely have to experience first hand. Word of caution... They aren't kidding with needing to be fully mobile. You are often in tight areas which require you to squat, kneel, shimmy, swim and climb. Those with knee/hip/back problems may have a tough time. The road to the river is also VERY bumpy. They keep it this way on purpose to make it difficult to get to so this beautiful place isn't ruined by those not on guided tours. For those who are doing this as part of a shore excursion from a cruise ship...I do wish we didn't have to hang around Playa del Carmen after to wait for the ferry (about 2 hours). You can go back earlier on your own but you have to pay your own way ($15 for ferry and $8 taxi fare). All that is included if you wait but there isn't really much to do other than window shop in expensive, high end stores or grab a Starbucks."

As nature and travel lovers we've known caves in different parts of Mexico, but this time R\u00edo Secreto (Secret River) surprised us because it's the first tour where we see they fully respect the nature of the grotto, due to this, there's no artificial illumination, you have to visit it adapting yourself to the irregularities of the soil, going in and out of the water and taking care one of each other in your group to complete the trip.Of course, the park gives you all the necessary gear to experience the cave as lifejacket, wet suit, helmet with LED light, water shoes and a guide that gives you all the briefing before entering the cave and taking care of you all the time. You also have to shower before entering and can't use any chemical in your body to keep the cleanliness of the water. Obviously, you can't touch anything inside the cave to avoid damaging the delicate formations.Because of all this care they have, knowing this cave gives you an amazing experience, where you can see untouched the wonderful stalagmites and stalactites formed during thousands of years, enjoy the crystal clear river inside and have a glimpse of what professional cave explorers see when entering an unexplored grotto.Don't miss this experience on your next trip to Riviera Maya."

Agree with the other reviewer that the constant presence of photography through the beginning bit of the tour kind of distracts from taking it all in but I suppose the demand for those photos keeps it a part of the package. We kind of wished there was a photo opportunity for when you begin to re-emerge from the cave as this was breathtaking and would have been a little less intrusive but these are minor gripes/suggestions. We had a great time and would make a point of returning for sure."

The guide consists of wet suit, water safety vest,helmet with a light, and water shoes. The excursion into the secret caves begin with a traditional blessing from the shaman. Entering the caves leaves one full of anticipation. The fresh water for the Yucatan peninsula is found in the cenotes that can be found throughout the area. The tour is 90 minutes long going through several grottos either on foot or \"swimming\" through the various pools. The caves are full of interesting lives from microscopic to fish, and to bats. I could not believe the excursion ended, it felt that it was only 5 minutes since the start. Highly recommended"

I would have gravitated toward scuba diving but this was a rare opportunity. This cave apparently was only found in 2006.Only ten percent is open for tours. We had an invocation from a local person, complete with burning amber and then had an amazing tour through the cave which is lit only by our helmets and a couple of flashlights. It is somewhat strenuous, but a nice change from sitting around on a cruise ship. I enjoyed the liqueur, food and wildlife in the jungle area at the end."

It was a fascinating experience but there were a few tight/narrow passages that might be unnerving for some people.Overall, I would highly recommend this excursion!

It was definitely a workout to say the least and we were very happy that we are on the shorter side navigating through the structures.

We had booked the excursion thru the Air Transat rep at the hotel and it worked out to be $218.00 USD for 2 Adults and 1 child.You start out from the main lobby by travelling by van thru the jungle on a long windy and very bumpy road. Once you arrive at the main area, you are provided with a wetsuit, life jacket, helmet and water shoes (yes, they do provide them). From that point, it's about a 10 minute walk until you read the entrance to the underwater cenotes. It is such an incredible experience to walk and swim through pools of fresh water and look at the surrounding rock formations with date back to over 1.5 million years old. It is hard to put into words just how amazing it is to be underground but yet and no time did I ever feel the slightest bit claustrophobic.Our tour guide was Yayo and he did a fantastic job of explaining the history of the place and has an excellent knowledge on the geology of the area. He was very engaging and would highly recommend him as a guide.Once the tour is over, you hand all your kit back and then an authentic Mayan buffet lunch is provided which was quite good. The only negative comment I can leave was on the high cost of pictures. There is a photographer with every group and he takes photos of each person at different points on the tour. I would have loved to have some of the pictures, however the cost was completely unreasonable. It was $25USD for 1 picture and something like $100 for a usb stick with pics on them. No reason for charging so much. I have the memory of the tour but would have loved to have the images."

It is well organized, the tour groups are reasonably sized (we had 10 people in our group) and the group leaders are excellent guides and educators. The caves and the underground river you walk thru are just magical, and unlike other attractions in the area, these are real and natural environments. Caves that over 1 million years in the making and at every turn you get a different view of clear water and cave formations, that in total just leave you kind of breathless. After doing the tour, my wife and I said to each other we would consider this a 'bucket list' kind of To Do. The only negative thing I can say about this tour, and this is in general for all the tours we took in Mexico, is that the price they charge for picture packages is outrageous, ranging from $120 for a \"complete\" package, to $40 for 2 pics. You are not allowed to bring cameras into the caves, so if you want a memento of your tour, they definitely have a captive audience. The price may not be bad if a whole group is paying for one package, but it's ridiculous for a single person or couple. We didn't take the picture/package option so you won't see any of our pics on this review."

This is a one and 1/2 hour experience walking/swimming through a cave that was just found in 2010. There are three different paths and all are different. I'm excited to go back my 3rd time to see the Suprema path. Only 10 % of the cave has been explored, they continue to find new ways around it. It is breathtaking! I think anyone even if clausterphobic can go on this.... people who struggle with walking may want to think twice as the ground is uneven.

            "review": "A Natural Beauty. My sister and I went on this trip as an excursion pick on our cruise. There were so many options to choose from but this was one of the only excursions that received 5 stars across the board. While we were nervous to be so adventures, we decided this was what this vacation was all about. Once we got off the ship we were greeted by a guide who took us on a 30 minute ferry ride to Playa del Carmen. From there our guide split our large group up into 3 smaller groups where we were loaded into 12 passenger vans. It was another 30 minute drive to the caves along very bumpy (but fun) dirt roads. It's a good idea here to start getting to know some of the passengers on your van because you will be spending the next 6 hours with this small group. Once you arrive at the caves you are greeted by your new guide who will be taking you through the caves. Our guide was JULIAN. While most people say they had the best guide, we actually did! You are given a key to a locker where you store everything. While Rio Secreto will provide water shoes, it's a good idea to bring your own. Next you are asked to rinse off in the provided, extremely cold showers. I recommend not putting on any lotions or perfumes before your trip. They try to keep the water there perfectly clean and pure. Once you rinse off, you are given a wet suit and a life preserver to put on. Definitely wear the wet suit because the water is bearable but definitely cold. Make sure to get a walking stick as well. It was not an option with our guide. He told us to each take one. We then took a short walk to where the cave was. Before going in, there is a short, non religious ceremony by a Mayan representative that was wonderful to be a part of. Once you enter the cave, we all sat for a few minutes to introduce ourselves to one another. Julian told us that for the next hour and a half we were like a family and had to treat each other like family, always looking out for each other. The tour through the caves was amazing. Julian was great about pointing out some of the most beautiful things in the caves. He always took the time to answer all of our questions. Our group truly became a family and all got along so well with one another. This excursion was one of the most amazing things I have ever done. The walk/swim through the caves was definitely work as you have to be so careful of your next step, but the hidden beauty that is inside is worth everything. Most of the tour consists of walking but there are a few areas where the water gets deep and you need to swim through it. Because of our life vests we basically floated through being able to look at everything as we did. There is one part towards the end where the water is higher and the ceiling is lower. My sister felt a bit claustrophobic but it didn't bother me at all. (For those of you that could potentially get that feeling at times.) All in all, we could have stayed in there forever! Afterwards, we changed back into our clothes and had a wonderful buffet lunch. Everyone was so hospitable! You can also purchase your pictures at this time. I bought a thumb drive for $89 but you can also purchase individual pictures for $25 each. The pictures were not as good as I was hoping for, but in order to have any remembrance of the trip I felt I had to buy them. The ferry ride back to the ship was not so much fun. It was very rocky and the ferry went very fast. Several people on board got sick. I strongly recommend sitting upstairs where it is all open and towards the back. All in all, an amazing day that we will never forget!"

We found this site online when looking for fun things to do while in Cozumel. We were completely prepared for a tourist trap complete with Hollywood-style light show, cement paths, lighted cavern chambers, and crowded spaces. The reality was completely different.While you do get herded from one place to the next, the \"herds\" are small, right down to the individual groups (no more than 10 people) that enter the caverns together. What was particularly impressive is how the several groups enter the caverns at different places (and tour different chamber groups) and never run into each other.All the required equipment is provided (wetsuit shorty, water sock booties, life jacket, walking stick, and lighted helmet), including your own personal paparazzi. :) Once you have received your briefing, showered, and received your gear, you hike about a quarter mile to the entrance of your cavern and begin your tour...no paved walkways, no lighted caverns (aside from the lights on your helmet), and no big show. Just you and your little group, your tour guide, and some interesting information about Mayan culture and their relationship with the caverns.When your tour is over, you return your equipment, change clothes (if you want), and then get served a very nice buffet of authentic Mexican food. Once you are fed, you can review (and purchase) photos of our tour (of just your family group, not the others in your group) and some very nice stock images of the caverns - but not necessarily the caverns that *you* got to see on your tour.Authentic, well done, and definitely an activity that I would recommend. It has a good price tag ($79/adult, $90 for the photos of just your family (although there are bigger and smaller packages), plus the cost of getting there, but it was worth every penny."

They provide you with water shoes (no additional charge), a wet suit, PDF and helmet with light. Our guide was extremely knowledgable about the whole area and the geology of the caves. You do need to be physically able to do this tour - there is a lot of walking - but more than that it is over VERY uneven ground, especially in the cave. There are times when I was more comfortable with one hand down for stability. You are walking in water a lot of the time - some knee deep, thigh deep and waist deep. There are big caverns - but also some tight spots. There is one area where you are in water up to your neck and the ceiling in about 2' above your head - so it can be a little tight for those with those kind of issues. And then there is swimming - you have your PFD, so no under water swimming - but you do have to swim. It was incredible - so peaceful and restorative. Highly highly recommended!"

We got an intresting tour, because for how many people were there that day and the group I was placed with spoke only spanish, they took us in the exit and we did a special tour. It took a little longer because the guide did this in Spanish and English. Bounus for me, learned a few new Spanish words. The guide was the most accommodating to all of us. I enjoyed the little extra time to really enjoy the amazing caves. I know this was truly a special tour, we were climbing into caves with on 2-3 feet of clearance. What a truly amazing river and cave system. Thanks to all at the Rio Secreto for an unforgettable experience."

Equipment : They provide helmets, wet suit, life jacket and water shoes. Bring your own if you do have. What you do : You walk a bit in the \"jungle\", you have a prayer to a mayan shaman saying grace to the sun and a thank you, then you go in the cave. Some route have more swimming than others, at time your feet wont touch the grounds. Some routes have more climbing and crouching. Guide : our Guide was Romain (french) and he did an awesome job explaining the history, fauna, speleology and so on. I recommend him. Appreciation : We enjoy our visit ! The time in the cave is interesting. Take the opportunity to look around, dont juste follow the trail by looking simply ahead, you might discover amazing scenes . Photos : 25 usd a piece or 89$ for a usb with the pictures of all your group. Make sure you smile and take a pose when the photographer is there ;)Food : interesting at most. Kept us from storming the buffet back at the resort !Overall : It was a nice experience, a bit pricy, but i recommend it !"

Jorge was an amazing guide he definitely knew what he was talking about and made it fun for us all.

If you go to the Playa del Carmen area, do this trip, it is truly breathtaking. Walking, and swimming through underground fresh water caverns taking in nature in all it's glory, magnificent. Our guide 'RRRaul' (yes, that's Raul with 3 R's!!) was friendly, passionate about his work, and very knowledgable about Cenotes and pretty much all thing to do with Mexican nature. I would not normally have hesitated at giving this attraction 5 stars, but I (and many of the others on our bus) was disappointed at the operators trying to charge $89 for the photo's they took of us. (no, that's not a typo, $89). My advice lower the price of the photo's, then more people will buy them giving you the same income, but so many more people will walk away rating this one of the best attractions in Mexico."

Were taken in a group from ship which was docked in Cozumel by ferry over to Playa de Carmen. This is a 45 min ferry ride. Were met on dock by van driver and rode for about 45 minutes into jungle location. There we met our wonderful guide, Julio. (He was very informative and passionate about this site.) We were given wet suits to put on over our swimsuits, fitted for life vests and helmets with lights and given water shoes. We had been told you could not use your own water shoes but that was incorrect. If you have some, preferably with thicker soles, use yours! Everyone had to do a quick rinse off in a shower (cold) to rinse off lotions, body oils, etc before heading to the cave. Walking sticks are available - highly recommend using! After that we were led into cave. You are in cave approximately 1 1/2 hr. It is a rugged walk over very uneven terrain in water. You need those walking sticks! There are about 3 spots of about 8' deep water where you basically float and paddle in your life jacket for about 10 yards. This is a very unusual, beautiful and interesting excursion. Following the walk through cave a buffet lunch is served. The grounds are very nice, well kept, with lots of relaxing hammocks. Restroom and dressing rooms are clean. You cannot take your camera into cave as you need both hands for maneuvering through the rough terrain, but there are photographers at scenic spots taking photos. Of course you can purchase these. After lunch we were then driven back into Playa where we had an hour of free time before boarding the ferry back to the ship. BTW, I am a 75 year old woman and with the help of Julio and my walking stick I made it through the river cave without too much trouble."

I signed up for this tour at my hotel...wife wanted to chill, couple we were with did a day trip that I'd been on before twice so tried this...it was new for me. Once you arrive at the check in area, which is just south of Playa del Carmen, you are then given a sheet of paper with your tour guide's name. Mine was the Mexican \"hippy\" guy (forgot his name but that's what he called himself). You were then put in a van with your tour group...no more than ten and with an English or Spanish speaking guide. Then you were driven what seems like about ten miles into the jungle. We were first taken to a restroom and locker area where we were given locks, wet suites, life preservers, water shoes and helmets with lights on them. We were then lead about another 1/4 mile on foot to the entrance of the cavern. Let me warn you. This is no Disneyland ride. This is no-kidding cavern exploration. Once we reached the cavern, had to go down some stairs that were cut into the rock. (Made the big mistake of going for a run in the morning...had an afternoon appointment at the Secret River). This is a pretty good workout. Once down in the cave we entered ankle deep water. Stalactites, bats, and all the stuff you'd think you'd see in an underground cavern. For much of the tour you were in water...at times over your head so you'd have to swim, other times you were neck deep in water with the cave roof just over your head...some tight spots. I had concerns of claustrophobia but our guide was so mellow (though totally professional and very knowledgeable) that I never got nervous. Were down there about two hours. The only lights were on our helmets and the flashlight our guide had. Afterwards a pretty steep walk up stairs to the exit. You need to have strong legs and good footing to do this as the bottom was often not flat. You had to watch your step every step of the way or you could fall into rocks and get cut. After we exited, walked back to the locker/bathroom area, we turned in our gear and then were taken to a lunch buffet. A photographer accompanies the group for most of the tour and pictures are available for sale at the end (shocker!). The buffet was just okay, not particularly good but not horrible. Water and lemonade were included but soda, beer and booze was extra. No problems with transportation to and from the hotel. This was a great experience. I'm very happy that I did it and I greatly enjoyed it. Just make sure you're in reasonably good shape or you might be miserable doing this tour."

Depending where you buy the tickets, make sure you make reservation. They only allow so many people in the cave at any given time. The whole tour takes about three hours, however you're only in the cave for about 1 1/2 hours. The first 45 minutes you watch a video, given instructions, then driven 3 miles to the cave entrance, and then given life vest and a miner's helmet. Once in the cave you either walk, crawl, or swim to the turn around point. A tour guide is with you the whole time along with a photographer. There is no lighting in the cave other than the light on your helmet. Our guide was a guy named Andres who spoke English and a really cool guy. After the tour your taken to a buffet (included in the entrance fee). I personally wasn't too thrilled with the food, but my wife and her family liked it. Over all I really enjoyed this tour and the only thing I didn't like is they don't allow you to take your own personal camera or phones in the cave. Afterward staff shows you the pictures that were taken by the photographer and you may purchase them. The pictures are pricey, but we ended up buying them because we split the cost between three family members. If you buy the pictures, they are given to you in a USB drive. Personally I don't think this tour is for anyone younger than 10 yrs old."

There was a little resting point were they had this sort of light show/movie on the walls of the cavern. It would have been cool but it was just really weird. After that we were able to swim through the caverns. It was so amazing. We had lights on our helmets and at one point our guide had us all turn them off. I've never experienced complete darkness before, there was no light for your eyes to adjust to, it was such a simple idea but really cool to experience. They fed us a meal when it was all said and done. The food was good but the only complaint was that they charged $60 for the CD of photos because we weren't allowed to take our own.

We loved wading and floating through the underground caves while our guide taught us more about the cave ecosystem and the underground rivers' role in the region's history.

If you've been to cave tours in other parts of the world, this is similar, but the fact this is all done in water is different and fascinating. Water is cool but not cold. Just amazing ecology when you think about it. Meal was good but not fantastic. Tour guide was great. Pricey and has the usual photographs scam, but definitely good value for money. Take the collectivo there and buy your own ticket."

It took about 30-40 minutes to get there from the port but we truly had an amazing time. Our guide was very knowledgeable and helpful the whole tour. The cave was truly beautiful and such a great experience, water was a little chilly but we had wet suits. I would pay to do this excursion again, they feed you some lunch at the end. My only disappointment was that we couldn't bring any cameras or anything inside and the photos are $90 which how can you not buy them...."

            "review": "Worth it!. We booked this as an excursion from our cruise trip. It was about a 45 minute boat ride from the port but trip although a bit choppy was so beautiful. The boat guides were fun and interactive throughout the ride and brought smiles to everyone's face. Once we arrived on land and got into the compound we were joined by Diego who was our guide for the rest of our trip and he made our journey one of the most memorable excursions we've been on. From paying our respect to the spirits, to his knowledge of the cavern, we left wanting to do the excursion all over again. The cave was beautiful and having to swim the end of it was the icing on the cake. I'd talk more about the cave, but it's best you experience it for yourself. Oh another thing about Diego; He was even nice enough to help one of the people in our group \"swim\" the rest of the way because she couldn't finish the rest of it. I cannot say enough good things about Diego. If you find yourself in Mexico this is simply something you cannot miss."

            "review": "Wonderful attraction, worth the price, great guides.. I'll keep this fairly short as I see other recent posters have covered a lot of detail. We went with my 14 year old son and almost 72 year old mother (hubby and I are late 40s). The cave system is beautiful. The guides are very well trained. Our guide, Tomas, informed my mom at the beginning that she would be his \"VIP guest\", meaning that she was up front so he could assist her with getting through the more challenging spots. She made it all the way through the cave system just fine with a little assistance from Tomas, but then had to sit down on the way back out. He patiently waited for her to catch her breath and was able to send the other 4 people in our tour back with another guide so they didn't need to wait.So two pieces of advice if you do this tour:1) take the walking stick. It's optional but very useful as you can't always see how the depth underwater is changing. The one guy in our group who didn't take the stick had to lean on his wife a lot of the time.2) Well, not really advice, but if you can spring for their photos, they do an excellent job. You can't take your own camera in. They send a professional photographer in with your group who puts extra flashes around so the lighting comes out really good. They have various photo packages... if you want no prints but all of the pics on a memory stick, I think I paid $89 US. Oh, one last piece of advice since I mentioned my older mom. My dad, who has more mobility issues now (he's 80) didn't come along. He would not have been able to do this tour. He can walk, but the uneven terrain was too much."

            "review": "Amazing experience wading through a becautiful underground cave. This is truly a one of a kind experience. Rather than just walking along paths in a fully lit cave, you decend into and then explore a beautiful stalactite and stalagmite filled cavern by way of the river which helped create its amazing beauty. Only the lights on your and other visitors hard hats and a few high intensity flashlights illuminate its beauty which enhances the shadows and helps make the experience truly exceptional.Wow, wow, wow.Yes, the precautions about being able to walk on uneven terrain, deal with being in a not fully lighted environment and being in a cave are all valid. Having a bit of fitmness and no back or joint impairments helps too - you do walk a bit in the jungle on the way to the cave entrance and there are uneven steps to get in and out of the cave. But while I could tell not every member of our small group (four adults and two 10 year old boys from one family and my husband and I) were sure they really wanted to do this, it was CRYSTAL CLEAR every one of us was thrilled they went a bit beyond their comfort level for this wonderful experience.Our guide (Alfredo Ponce) and a photographer were with us the whole time to teach, support and educate us. And, although we were in the cave about 15 minutes than usual it seemed like the experience ended moments after it started. All that was said in the other positive reviews is correct. WONDERFUL.They also sell photos and will have pictures of just those in YOUR group if your tour has more than one family as ours did. Are pricey but proceeds from their sale do help support maintenance of this very unusual site. Would suggest getting at least one. If you want more than one you might as well choose the package with many additional pictures not from your tour. They are phenomenally beautiful. The provided wet suits, swimming shoes, hard hats and (at the end) towel were all clean and the staff made sure they fit well. One of the added bonuses is that you get to see a bit of Playa del Carmen and some of the local roads and highways, as well as the lush vegitation along the curving dirt road which leads to the entrance to the cave. We also had a very nice local meal after our cave experience. There was also beer, soda and snacks for sale. if you are on the tour from a cruise ship you also get a delightful but fairly long ferry boat trip from the ship (will be docked at Cozumel) to Playa del Carmen. You may even have a small about of time to explore Playa del Carmen in the area near the ferry dock while waiting for the ferry back to Cozumel. Don't worry about missing the ferry. The tour staff closely monitor everyone gets to the ferry. If a trourist misses it, that would be the tourist's fault."

            "review": "WOW. 58 of us are on the tour to the \u201cAmazing Secret River\u201d. We were broken down into five groups traveling in five large Toyota mega vans. The drive out of the city on paved roads went about 10 miles. (Amazingly, there are sidewalks all the way out here on one side of the road = Future expansion I suppose) to a point close to where you would normally turn East to Tulum (small Inca structure on the ocean front), where we turned West onto a dirt road into the jungle for about 5 miles of bumpy road. The property we entered is private with what \u201cthey tell us = we did not see it) a very large gravel pit at the far end of that dusty road (now I know another reason other then the sun, why the vans are all white).The property is a natural conservatory area (outlined by National Geographic magazine a number of years ago) to preserve the wild life (Black puma\u2019s / Leopards / Raccoon like animal / etc.). Back in 2006, the landowner stumbled across this opening in the jungle floor that allowed access to an underground Lambeth of caves.Background = About 6,000,000 years ago the Yucatan land mass of today was an underwater coral reef that was lifted up above the water (not sure if this was a geological lift or a drop in sea level).Today as you fly over this area (the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico) you do not see any flowing water (streams or rivers) as due to the porous nature of the limestone the water flows under the surface, and is only occasionally exposed as cenotes (cave-in\u2019s of the surface stone exposing pools of water.The cave and underground passage / river was open to the public 8 years ago and has been a hit ever since. Open all year round, with high water inside the cave being experienced in October.You are given a guide (there were about 8 sightseers in our group) who first gives you a lock and locker for your belongings, then has everyone shower (in your bathing suits) to remove any chemicals / stuff, then the guide provides you with a 3 mill shorty wetsuit & beach shoes & helmet with light & life jacket & walking stick. = You will find the Walking stick and Life Jacket are VERY important!!!!Hint \u2013 Hint = Get the next bigger size life jacket so that you are more flexible in the caves.We brought along our own beach shoes, but not necessary as they provide such. I would suggest (but not necessary) we would have been better off bring along our wetsuit shoes that cover our ankles (that\u2019s what the guides wear). BIG PROBLEM --- THEY DO NOT allow you to bring along a camera or an additional flashlight. At first I though ---- YEA you want to sell us pictures (and they do a great job of having a special photographer accompany each group). But I later realized you need your hands free as you go through the cave & water passageways and even a hand held waterproof go pro camera would be a determent as it would restrict your hands keeping you upright. NO they will not allow you to take along a Go Pro that mounts to you helmet (again they are out to sell you pictures).Anyway --- The Guide (Valentino for us) gave us a very detailed explanation of the cave history and how to process through it. He was instrumental in helping us along all the way with very caring concerns and excellent information. I have been in a number of natural caves (spelunking) in my exploits (Brown County in southern Indiana / Mammoth Cave in Kentucky / Ruby Falls & Lost Canyon in Tennessee to name a few. Not to mention WW II Japanese caves in Pellilue / New Zeeland / diving underwater in Cozumel). Sure there are most likely other great caves to visit, but THIS CAVE is the BEST I have ever been in!Because there is a LOT of up and downs / tight passages / on & off water entries (water depth was mostly around 2 ft but there was one location where it was 10 ft deep = Yea life jacket is a must) I would NOT suggest this tour for anyone that is not very flexible and stable on their feet, although my BIG BROTHER of 30 years age (with 50 years of additional experience) made it through OK, (but by the end he had enough)! There were two groups that had small children, and those groups bypassed a lot of the difficult walking areas. This cave system is MASSIVE with only about 10% open to tour.Following the exit from the cave, we turned in all our equipment, changed into dry clothes and then viewed our pictures --- WOW = Really good stuff. Option to buy was $85 for all the pictures of us (just John and I) along with some Fu Fu fill pictures, or $25 for just one picture (well I had to get that one).We then had lunch, which was very good, followed by our return trip in the van."

Though it is 100% a tourist attraction (complete with the option to buy a photo package at the end), it is a unique experience and the opportunity to see amazing natural underground caves, rock formations, and clear water. The Rio Secreto experience involves a brief video orientation followed by a short van ride to the cave site. Once at the site, you are given a wetsuit, helmet with light, and water vest. You should bring your own water booties. You then walk to the cave and descend into a truly remarkable natural setting of clear shallow water, amazing rock formations, and darkness. Though there are a couple of areas where the water is deep enough in which to float, you are walking most of the time. The guides are extremely helpful and knowledgable during the 90 minute excursion into the caves, and you always feel safe. My wife and young adult daughters enjoyed themselves throughout. Though they boast a buffet feast of Mexican cuisine afterward, the food was pretty awful and not worth eating. Despite this, the caves are worth taking a morning for this excursion."

From our arrival at the site everything was well organized, sizing for wetsuits, footwear, lifejackets etc. The tour was conducted in small groups (ten) and it was a short walk to the cave mouth from the arrival site. Along the way our guide identified different types of flora in the region. There are six different routes that are used, which is great because you never run into another group while in the cave.I have never been in a cave like this before and it was very informative. We spend at least an hour and half in the cave. There was some swimming and most of the time was wading through the refreshing water. I would definitely recommend this as an item to do if you are in the Playa del Carmen region."

She lead our group of 9 through the jungle where we took part in an ancient ceremony before descending into a sinkhole to the amazing caves and river below.1.5 hrs later we returned to the surface, walked back to the lockers, were given a free shot an unusual local liquor, browsed our photos and were given a free lunch before leaving.Tip: Bring comfortable water shoes as you will be walking much more than swimming.Tip2: Walking in varying depths of water on very uneven terrain for a long time can be difficult and dangerous, especially since you cannot always see clearly through the water.Tip3: If taking the ferry back to Cozumel, know that there are two different docks for cruise ships there and the ferry might not be taking you to the dock you want. Although a cab on shore will."

However you get here, you'll be glad that you did."

Our guide Bohish was excellent, very passionate about the cenotes and very informative. We started with the ATV's - wear pants, they get hot around your ankles. One of my friends dropped out because of that. The road they take you on wasn't that exciting - the ending of the ATV's we went into the jungle and was more challenging and fun!The cave was so special and amazing - truly a once in a life time experience. Would recommend!"

The pictures you see make it look like the cave is all lit up, but it's actually dark in there with the exceptions of your head lamps. Guoda was our guide and she was fantastic. We could tell she knew so much about the cave and really loved the environment. She was also pretty funny and snarky. I enjoyed having her as a guide! The water is really cold at first, but I warmed up quickly (and I'm a small person who gets cold very easily). I was sad when the tour was over. It wasn't scary and instead was amazing. I loved the picture we got of us standing on the rocks with the stalagmites behind us. So awesome! I would recommend this to everyone."

The road in to the jungle is very rough so be ready for that. It is well worth the ride. You get an introduction to the cenotes and the area before putting on a wetsuit, helmet and light and hiking down into to caves. You spend about an hour moving through the water inside the caves and see amazing sites. Some of the terrain is a little rugged, you need to move carefully. There are a couple of spots where you can float along in the water. You can pay extra for photographs. I recommend doing so, since you can't take any photos yourself."

I highly recommend this activity to someone with an adventurous spirit. The water is cold at first, but doesn't take much time to adjust to.

The tour guide was enthusiastic and very helpful. He was basically hanging on to my life jacket and dragging me across the water. ;) Refreshments and lunch was provided.

Your journey starts by getting into your bathing suits, showering (to remove oils that can negatively effect the cave,) and then squeezing into a wet suit, water shoes, hard hat with LED light, and a life jacket. Walking sticks are optionally provided.You take a small hike through the jungle to get to the opening of the cave, or cenotes. On the way they perform a Mayan blessing with amber incense as the locals are very respectful of Mayan tradition. Next you enter the cave.You descend into the cave and are immediately exposed to water. 90% of your experience will be in water; however, you never submerge. Most of the experience is knee to waist deep but there are a few areas you have to swim or rather float, as the life jackets are incredibly buoyant. If you have trouble, the guide will help you.The cave formations are absolutely incredible.Afterwards, they serve an authentic Mexican lunch.The one negative about this experience I had was you stop quite frequently to have pictures taken. They do not allow personal cameras or photography of any kind. Everything must be purchased through the tour service. The full picture package was almost $120 and you can buy a single picture for $25."

The boat ride from Cozumel to Playa del Carmen was ruff the day we went and the bus ride to the cave was bumpy and hot. Ok, there I said it just like everyone else...but the Amazing Secret River is AMAZING!!!! Well worth any inconvenience we encountered. The water is cold but after getting in it is pleasant, our guide Andres was EXCELLENT! He stopped and explained every time anyone asked a question. He helped people who were afraid of the water or of taking a step (this is not difficult walking as reported in some other reviews, if you can hike you can easily make this trip), and he was pleasant and very informative. He even sat with our family for about 15 minutes while we waited for the lock on our locker to be cut off when he could have easily left us to fend for ourselves. The cave is beautiful, you are allowed to look closely at the stalactites and stalagmites (I know which is which because I asked Andres), you are asked not to touch any natural formations but you really can't help it because you are walking among them. I loved this and will go back to Playa del Carmen again just to take this tour. Thank you Andres for making this a memory I will never forget."

It lasts half a day including travel from and to the hotel, preparation, visit and lunch. The staff was friendly and our guide Rodolfo was very knowledgeable and had a lovely French accent. We did the Allegria tour and heard afterwards that there were at least 3 or 4 other paths, meaning additional opportunities to come back and explore. It is not that cold contrary to one could think. The toughest part is to take a cold shower and slide in that tight wet suit. Once you are set up with the helmet, shoes and life jacket, you will be in for a walk through the jungle and a mayan ritual ceremony. There the journey underground starts with its natural wonders. We walked in the water, discovered bacon and popcorn natural formations (yes that is a teaser!), meditated for a few minutes in a lake in the dark among bats and catfish, swam among the stalactites and stalagmites. The groups were small which was perfect to connect respectfully with this unique and fragile environment. If you like adventure and nature, this is a must see!"

We were fortunate to have a group of just five people, three of whom spoke only Spanish and the two of us who spoke only English. Our guide, Valentino, did an excellent job guiding us and translating in both languages. We are not certain how the tour might have worked had we been in a larger group with three or more languages. The cave system is so vast that a number of different tours can take place simultaneously. We only saw one other group, at a distance, during our time in the caverns. As a result, it was easy to focus on the experience. The only downsides to the experience were the emphasis on taking our pictures through the first half of the tour, in hopes of selling them to us at the end. At $25 a pop, there were none sold in our group. The other element that could be improved was the lunch included at the end of the tour. It was not at a standard fitting Playa Del Carmen. Overall, however this is a first-rate experience and we would recommend it highly."

They transport you in a van. Road is quite rough. When you arrive, they get you partnered up with a guide. Small groups. All gear supplied including wet suits. Change rooms provided. If you have your own water shoes along I'd recommend using them. Their's are pretty beat up and may fit a bit sloppy. The terrain is rough down under and a decent fit on shoes is good idea for better traction. Instructions and what to expect all given by bilingual guide. They offer a walking stick, which in hindsight we wish we'd taken. The terrain inside is very uneven and rough and several places you're required to take big steps up or down and into the water and you can never be sure how you land as it is dark except for the headlights on your helmet. If you're vertically challenged, (short) you will need a bit more help in spots due to steep drops into water or out. If you are at all unsteady this is not for you unless you have someone to help and steady you. The guide can assist one person but the rest must help each other, which we all did. We had one older gentleman (70's) that required a fair bit of assistance, which I think surprised him as he seemed quite fit otherwise. Was only maybe 1- 2 spots where it was over our heads, but short stretches. The food after was satisfying. Fine for vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free and meat eaters. The guide, Pauline was knowledgeable and interesting. Her English okay. Sometimes others in group helped her find the best words to interpret for us. I'd recommend when questions asked by others in Spanish to interpret all for non Spanish speaking. We felt we lost some of the conversations because of that. Use mosquito repellent when outside. They had some eco friendly on posts to use. Overall would recommend."

(This attraction should not be taken by anyone that is unsteady in their walking, as the surface inside the cenote is uneven and it is sometimes hard to see to the bottom.) That said I really enjoyed this site. Everyone was sorted into different languages so that our guides could better tell us about everything. Groups were taken to the entrance where we received out life jackets, wet suits, safety helmets, walking stick & our lockers. When we were changed, our guide escorted us to one of four entrances to the cenote, where a short Mayan ceremony was carried out. Once inside, we were transported to an entirely different world. Romain, our guide was very knowledgeable and helpful. We were cautioned to avoid touching any of the stalagmites and stalacites. We used the walking stick to steady us and in other areas we swam for a short distance. The overhead clearance was fairly good. (When there is a large amount of rain, certain sections may be closed as the clearance may be too low). I loved the fact that there was only the 8 of us and the guide in our area. It was nice that we were not overrun by a billion other tourists. We only started to hear another group just at the end of our 1.5 hours underground. Once outside, we changed and were treated to a Mayan liqueur and a hearty lunch before departing back to our hotels. This attraction was very cool - most of us never get to see stalagmites & stalacites up close and personal. If you are looking for something different in the way of excursions, this is the one for you. It was well worth the price."

After watching a quick video we loaded up in vans and took a 10km or so drive down a dirt road that was more pot holes than quality road. The transportation home was also lacking. Not only did we have to go down the 10km horrible road, we had to do it with 15 people in a 15 person van. That is it for the complaints. The actual activity was one of, if not the most, exciting excursions we had while spending time in Mexico. We had the opportunity to hike through an underground waterway and see some interesting wildlife, including but not limited to a giant whip spider, a few sleeping bats, and later on, a few motmots. Our guide Raul was extremely knowledgeable and knew the latin names of all the species we asked about. This made my nerdy veterinarian girlfriend very happy. He also did an amazing job of helping along a couple of older people who should not have signed up for the tour to start with.We did the 'plus' option, which was another 20 dollars or so per person. It allowed us to take a bike ride to another cave, rappel down, and do a bit more adventuring. At the end of the tour, you had the option of (over) paying for a set of pictures (89 dollars). Despite the price, we purchased the pictures because we wanted to remember this great trip."

It took about 30-45 minutes to get there then another 20 minute ride on a bumpy unpaved road to get to the caves. Our tour guide was Guoda. She was funny and snarky and had a genuine love and appreciation for the area and conservation in general. The cave tour was beautiful and not cold after the first 5 minutes or so. We swam out to the middle of a pool of water (size of a medium sized swimming pool and about 5 feet deep) and turned off all our lights so it was pitch black. It was really unforgettable. My wife isn't a big adventurer and was nervous about the cave hiking/swimming part but she loved it the whole time and was never nervous. There was a quick meal afterwards and then another shuttle back to the resort. It was a 8am - 1:00pm type of trip. Very nice."

From the gate it took about 20 minutes to get there and the road was a bit bumpy (the van in front of us had to pull over and a woman barfed).Anyway the start of the tour was good. We had to take a cold shower before donning the wet suits (pretty cold at 9 a.m.!) and we were off on the trail before we knew it.We got a blessing from a Mayan guy before entering the cave which was nice.Despite it being a cold morning, after we started going down the stairs into the cave it got pleasantly warm and after that wading or swimming in the water was totally fine.IF YOU CAN'T SWIM IT IS NOT A PROBLEM. There were three parts I think where we had to doggy paddle but the life jackets make it impossible to drown.The formations in the cave were great and I had no idea some of them even existed in nature.Anyway we had an awesome time and the lunch afterward was great.I only knock this down a star because of the photo \"scam\". They don't let you bring ANYTHING in including a camera. They have their photographer running around on the fringes taking pics and you get to have a look on the computers after at what she took.They wanted $20 USD for one pic on a CD (what a waste) and something like $79 USD for 10 pics on a CD. I think the highest price was $139 or something.I'm sure everyone would have bought a CD with everything on it for $20 and they probably would have made more money. We sucked it up and paid the $20 for A PICTURE to have but really the pics were not that good and MANY were blurry and unfocused. The high price and extortion for the souvenir photos left a bad taste in my mouth.However if you don't care about souvenirs and only memories and love caves, this is the tour for you!"

The van trip from Playa was 10 minutes from town and then once on property another 15 or so on a dirt road.The underground cave/river network is a natural wonder not to be missed when visiting the Yucatan peninsula. While I hear that there are other locations and differing operators, it's important to note that these are not government controlled operators and you are on private land. The Rio Secreto team lease the rights to use from the land owner and operate under a notion of preserving a natural wonder. Please respect their vision and follow their rules.Our family of four was teamed with a couple and another family of 4. You must be able to walk, hike, crouch, use stairs, float and not be claustrophobic to enjoy the hour or so adventure underground. What you see and experience is something that cannot be duplicated. You rinse off and get dressed in a provided wetsuit, watershoes, helmet with light, and PFD vest, grab a hiking stick and walk out into the jungle to one of the openings lead by an experienced guide. Climb down and enter the world of the caves and learn how they were formed, what lives in them and other phenomena. You're on a directed path climbing over formations, floating on a river (very slight current) and absorbing a side of nature very rarely seen and experienced. We had Santiago as our guide and it was clear that he was passionate about nature and his job as an advocate of preservation for this natural wonder. He was a fantastic guide.We ended with a celebration toast a light lunch and then ride back the Playa. I would strongly suggest taking this tour if you are able."

I was a little apprehensive because I am almost 70 but as long as you don't have walking problems and are not afraid of the water, you will have the time of your life. You wear a wet suit, swim shoes, life jacket and helmet (all provided) , just bring your swimsuit. You have a guide and photographer with you in the cave. The water temperature is very comfortable. This cave was just discovered a few years ago and it is so pristine you wonder if at some point admittance may be restricted or stopped. My advice is to see it before any restrictions are placed on it, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Once out of the cave, they even provided a delicious lunch after we changed into our regular clothes. My only complaint was the cost of the pictures and while it was a huge amount of pictures that the photographer took and while they were of a very high quality, it was too expensive I thought, since you are with a group, you really don't want pictures of everyone unless you are friends or family."

You do some walking and in some areas the stick came in handy in keeping your balance. The water is on the cooler side but they do provide you with wetsuits so it isn't to bad. If you can I would schedule the first tour of the day. You have a better chance of seeing more of the wild life and I think the wetsuits would be warmer and easier to get into! It was amazing floating through the underground crystal clear river and viewing the stalagmites and stalactites. A must see!"

At the end of the tour we all got a shot of the liqueur branded by Rio Secreto that was kind of like Sambuca with a touch of honey as a reward. The buffet lunch was very good, the Chicken and Lime Soup was my favourite! We learned a lot about the stalagmites and stalactites and it was a great experience all around."

We were in Playa del Carmen for about ten days, and fortunately booked this trip on the only rainy day, which didn't matter since we were underground most of the time! Water was crystal clear and refreshing. The gear they provided was good. You have to do some minor climbing around and on rocks but nothing serious. Andreas was very educational and helpful for anyone that needed help. We had a group of 8 and negotiated a fair deal on the photo CD at the end ($40/couple) I thought that was reasonable and we got photos of everyone in our group and then some 'stock' photos of the cave as well. We did not eat there as we were at an All Inclusive Resort and headed back right away. Did have a couple of shots of Xtabent\u00fan at the end, however. That's a must in Mexico! Highly recommended."

He gave us wrist bands and instructed us to board the ferry to Playa del Carmen. The ride takes about 35 minutes and it is quite bumpy. If you are at all prone to motion sickness, you need to pre medicate or you will join numerous fellow passengers puking. Once off the ferry, you will ride a van (in good condition) to Rio Secreto. Once there, you will be asked to rinse off before you put on your wet suit. The reason for the rinse is that they want to preserve the cleanliness of the cave water so they want you to wash off any potential contaminants such as bug spray, sunblock, etc... (in other words, don't apply of of those before you go). Once you have your wet suit (you will want it because the water is probably around 70 degrees), you will be given a life jacket and helmet with light, both mandatory. Once everyone is ready, you will go on a short hike with your guide (we had Raul who was fabulous). Prior to entering the cave, you will participate in a Mayan prayer, then on to the adventure. It is quite simply a beautiful cave. We have been in caves before but the addition of the water aspect provides a whole new dimension that is simply breathtaking.Things to know:1. You will need water shoes, which you can buy there for $10 (the same cheap ones you can get at any Walmart or Target during the summer). If you want better ones, we got Columbia Rainmakers before our trip.2. Do not bring a camera as they are not allowed for safety reasons. Before I entered the cave, I thought that rule might be in place just so they can make money off photographs. However, after venturing through the cave, I realize why they want visitors to focus on taking their next step rather than on taking pictures. Yes, the photos are expensive ($89) but they're not Disney expensive. 3. You will be in water 95% of the time. Most of the time will be spent walking through water but there are 3 areas where you will have to swim a little.4. You need to be able to see in low light and to be able to walk on uneven surfaces. This does not mean you need to gave 20/20 vision or be an athlete but because of the relative darkness other than the light on everyone's helmet and various step off and step ups, not everyone can do this tour.5. The tour takes about 60-90 minutes.Once the tour was done, we hiked back to the general area where we got changed. We then had a complimentary lunch with drinks, all of which I would characterize as authentic. Once we were done with lunch, we boarded the van back to the docks. We had some time to walk around before boarding the ferry.I would absolutely recommend Rio Secreto as a must-do activity when you are in Playa del Carmen or Cozumel. The caves are astounding and the activity is fun. I wish we could have gone through more of the caves."

First of all, if you are going on this excursion from a cruise boat, as we did, be prepared for the 45 minute ferry ride each way from Cozumel which can be, and often is, quite rough. One in our party is motion sensitive and we sought a pharmacy and Dramamine for her before the return trip. Our tour coordinator, Angel, was very well organized, explained things clearly to our group and prepared us for the 30 minute or so ride to the preserve in which the cenote is situated. That, too, is a bumpy ride once you are off the highway and on the preserve's unpaved, cratered road. Totally worth the rocky ride though. Tomas was our guide once at their base. Groups of no more than 12 each have a guide and are assisted in getting outfitted for the event. Once you have your helmet, wetsuit, life vest, walking stick and water shoes you are ready to go. Lockers are there for your clothing and items like jewelry, cameras and phones, as none are permitted in the caves. A short hike to a cave entrance and you begin walking through the cave. The walking stick is helpful as it is very uneven and at times narrow between rock formations, which you are asked not to touch. Great effort is made to preserve the integrity of this lovely place. Most of the time is spent walking, though there is some swimming. The cave's exit is narrow and not for the claustrophobic.A photographer takes lots of pictures available for purchase throughout your time in the cave. We thought they were worth buying.It was a great experience and one I wish our 11 year old grandson had come along for, as he would have enjoyed it. While not a grueling outing, one does need to do a fair amount of walking over very uneven terrain and some climbing of stairs, so it would not be something for someone truly infirm. I am in my 60s and not especially fit and did just fine. The ages in our group ranged from 20s to 60s."

It is definitely not for anyone who has balance or mobility issues, but great for those who can manage. First there is a video and a lecture on preserving the delicate ecology. Then you are taken for 20 minutes along a very bumpy road to the cave entrance. There you are given a wetsuit, helmet with light, and lifejacket and offered a walking stick (take it, you will need it), a cold shower and a Mayan purification. Then you are taken in groups of about 10 people with a guide in your own language for about 1/2 mile through the cave. There is no prepared path or lighting, and the way is uneven and underwater for some parts. It is an adventure. The cave is beautiful, and it is actually quite a spiritual experience. Our guide was Alondra. She knew her stuff, and was funny and smart. I struggled a bit at first because I have an inner ear difficulty that affects my balance. I found her helpful, but a bit brusque and I felt a bit demeaned by her attitude. But overall the tour was great. The tour included lunch which was OK. Cameras are not allowed. A photographer accompanies the tour and takes pictures which they try to sell you at the end of the tour. They cost $89.00 US for the set. We didn't purchase them, feeling the price was just too much. I don't think anyone from our group purchased the set, though a few people bought individual pictures for $25.00 They might sell more pictures if they didn't charge so much. We are told the money goes toward conservation."

            "review": "Awesome underground river, but a bit of preparation to get there. First off the underground river, in the limestone encrusted caves was wonderful. The adventure paddling through areas of water sometimes greater than 6 feet was energizing. The stalactites and stalagmites at points with sparkling crystals was beautiful and the immensity of the caves they had formed over millions of years was humbling. Finally, our guide (Lara) was not only knowledgable but you could see her passion for the caves and wonders above and within it. Definitely go if you want to see something you may never see again.This is find for kids 10 and up. We had a 10 year old from another family and our 13 year old girl. The both did fine and had a great time.The tour provided all the gear needed for the trek through the caves including a helmet with light.The tour ended with a celebration of Mayan Alcohol and a decent meal.There are also many photographs taken that are available for purchase on USB. It was a little pricey but it also included stock photos from the area.I would caution that if you are someone who does not have strong legs or good balance this is probably not for you. The ground varies quite a bit and you are carrying the weight of a water soaked wet suit, and helmet. Some people in our party got a few scrapes just from incidental contact gong through the water and bumping into jutting stalagmites.Other notes of interest are... The road from the main entrance to the entrance to the cave is bad and long. The bus that took us in had to stop, start, and veer to avoid or limit the impact of the potholes in the wide sandy road. The preparation took us a while. This included a movie about the site, changing into bathing suits, lockering belongings, acquisition of wetsuit, helmet, water shoes, and walking stick. This was made chaotic by at least 4 groups coming at the same time speaking 3 languages.Everything factored in the trip through the cave was a memory worth having."

            "review": "Really Awesome!. I did the Plus Tour a few days ago. While this tour was fun, it's probably worth just doing the basic 3 hour tour which takes you right to the underground pool. The Plus tour consisted of an introduction, a tour of a dry cave, a tour of a cave with water that was to our waist, which we repelled into, a bike ride to the cave we repelled into, and the best and final part, exploring the cave with the underground river and pool. Most of the tour guides, if not all speak more than one language, so groups are set up with one guide, who then may take a group of people who are from 2 different countries. For example, people who just speak English are paired up with people who speak German or Russian. In our case we had a group of 6 people, 4 Russian speakers and my husband and myself who speak English. The drawback is that my husband and I had a LOT of down time while the guide explained things to the Russian people. This was the only down side. While we loved our Guide, it felt like it took twice as long to explain things in Russian than English. That being said, it was a great day. PS. Food for lunch was \"eh\". And loved our guides perspective on Nature, the Mayans and Life itself."

It is very uneven terrain and if you happen to be a tad clumsy (like I am!) it's not that easy to keep your balance. That being said - I would do the tour again if given the opportunity. The guide was knowledgeable and very helpful. She actually realized that this wasn't easy for me and helped me throughout the tour!You see stalagmites and stalagtites etc, neat rock formations, fish etc. Very interesting and fun! It is a half day tour so a good one to do if you don't want to be away from your resort for a full day."

            "review": "Fantastic Cave Tour. Took this tour with my family last week and it was by far the highlight of our trip. The caves are beautiful and our guide (Alondra) was simply fantastic. We have caved frequently with our two boys (now 15 and 17 years old) and we all agreed that these caves our now a new favorite. Simply cannot describe how tranquil and amazing it is to float through these living caves in the crystal clear water. Very much appreciate that they take care with this wonderful natural resource and that preservation is such a part of the mission. If you have time, take the extended tour (rappelling into a cave and a walk through a 'dry cave' - It's a longer day but so, so worth it. As other reviewers have said, the buffet lunch at the end is authentic and delicious, make sure to try the Hibiscus tea, it's a new family favorite. Would go back in a heartbeat and will do so on our next trip to Cancun!"

            "review": "Do Not Miss!. We did this tour today and loved it! We were expecting something simple but were impressed. First, the operation is very well organized. As you arrive you are put into a small group. We were 11. I think they are all about that size. We were assigned to Alfredo. You are put in a van and take a pretty long drive. Once you arrive you are given a locker. Everyone get water shoes, a wetsuit, helmet and a life vest. You should also take a walking stick. Trust me here. Everyone takes a mandatory shower. Next it's a pretty long walk to the cave opening. Before entering a shaman does a little prayer and burns incense. The caves are incredible. The formations are not to be believed. It's like entering another world. At times you walk, at times you wade, at times you float. It's not easy so you have to go slowly. This is where the stick comes in because you're not supposed to touch the formations. Alfredo was a fabulous guide. He was genuinely concerned about our welfare, constantly asking if we were okay. His enthusiasm was contagious - it was clear that he loves his job and was thrilled to be sharing the caves with us. Don't miss Rio Secreto if you are in the area."

            "review": "An experience of a lifetime. This is a spectacular natural caving experience! They are very well organized to move a large number of people through the area yet are still able to provide an experience that makes one feel that you are a select group of people experiencing this natural wonder that starts with an authentic Mayan welcome that was pretty cool. Victor was our guide, he spoke good English, his reverence and respect for his country\u2019s natural environment was evident as was his knowledge of the geology and environment of his country. He was very patient and respectful of the participants who were not well suited to some of the physical aspects of this trek, but we benefited from the slow and steady pace he adopted to accommodate them as we were at the back have so had the opportunity to take in the amazing cave formations around us which were truly amazing. The stalactites, stalagmites, columns and cascades are incredible and Victor pointed out different formations and explained the process of how they were formed. I would recommend that you definitely be able to navigate uneven footing (be steady on your feet) and be able to step over and through rock formations that you can\u2019t necessarily see in the water along with the ability to swim (at least dog paddle) as you will have to swim about 275 meters in the river depending on the route (they have 6 different routes that depends on the number of groups in the cave and the conditions in the cave system as the water level changes based on the amount of rain the area receives ). The water is not as cold as the prep showers (whoa that was cold!) The life vests and wet suits along with water shoes (if you didn\u2019t bring your own) keep you warm enough. They provide helmets with lights on them and the guides have underwater flashlights. The water is very clear but depending on where you are in the group line up can become murky underfoot as it is very fine sand at the bottom. You cannot take any waterproof camera or GoPro equipment into the cave - a photographer comes along with your group and the pictures taken are very well done and beautiful, they have chosen the best spots to take your photo which they offer you to purchase on a CD (it is a money making operation after all). They have lockers to store your clothes, shoes,valuables, etc and they offer towels if you don\u2019t bring your own. The staff are all very pleasant and are eager to make your experience amazing.There are change rooms and washrooms that are clean and modern (not primitive), after you exit the cave and change you can purchase the pictures taken in the cave. They also serve a light lunch in an open air dining area that is very nice, don\u2019t expect gourmet food it\u2019s basic , so if you are a picky eater then best that you eat before you arrive. We were on an excursion from a cruise ship, so we didn\u2019t have an opportunity to use the bicycles we saw to explore the trail system, if you are able take that in as well but heed the warnings to stay on the paths as there are poisonous plants in the forested area."

            "review": "Excellent Excursion. I arrived at Rio Secreto thinking we might do a bit of walking and spend most of the time swimming in the caves - well, read ahead before going folks! It's quite a lot of 'walking/climbing/ducking/helping the people in front and behind you' hiking in up to waist deep water. For me it was great fun, but there were a couple in my group that perhaps weren't as suited for that strenuous of an excursion. The drive into Rio Secreto was on a long dirt road with a lot of holes - be prepared for a bumpy ride. Upon arrival we were given wet shoes, wet suits to wear over our bathing suits, life jackets and helmets with flashlights. We had been told to bring sneakers, but not sure why unless you were staying the day and walking around the grounds extensively. Our tour was just a part day. We had a short walk to the caves, participated in a Mayan ceremony before entering and began the hike. There were a few spots where the photographers took group photos (note: you cannot take your own camera) and there was a spot or two where it was deep enough for us to swim before hiking out and back to the lockers. Our guide (I think his name was Julian?) was AWESOME! Very funny and informative. Great personality for doing tours. We had the buffet after our tour - I'm a picky eater, so I didn't eat much but for those wanting to try some Mexican dishes it would be great. You could also buy snacks, some souvenirs and your photos before leaving. Would definitely recommend it to anyone who has not been inside caves before! Beautiful to see! For those with troubles walking or that are perhaps a bit claustrophobic, maybe call ahead to discuss suitability."

Be warned that they don't tell you in advance of booking that upon arrival you will switch vans and be transported by a second van an additional 20 minutes along a very very awful bumpy dirt road that leads back to the entrance for this. It is such a bad road that one girl actually got \"sick\" to her stomach and had to get out of the van along side the road. The ride is not for weak stomachs. However, if you can take the ride to get there its an amazing experience. Its just beautiful. They do not allow you to take any cameras but force you to pose for pictures and purchase only what they take. The photos are very expensive. I did purchase one picture and it was well worth it because it was so amazing. I didn't need all the others with the entire group, etc. Just me and my husband in one amazing shot was fine. Our guide was Andres and he was awesome. They provide a lunch afterward which is sufficient. Nothing extravagant but decent. Then be prepared that once you eat you have that terrible ride back through the crater dirt road 20 plus minutes to the exit where the main road is."

Rio secreto is best adventure, Alondra our guide was a real 'mother' of our family, she was awesome mother, took care of each of 10 family members. Tour underground was great which cannot be explained in writing must visit to view the formations, Alondra very knowledge and full of information answered all our questions, No rush to complete the tour, takes enough time to visit and explain the formation.There were 2 members on the family who were not able to swim the last lag, where Alondra helped them swim and made it very comfortable to complete the tour. Without our 'mother' Alondra help this trip was very comfortable, I would suggest to visit this place once in life, and Alondra as your guide will be bonus.Pictures take by JJ photographer was great, worth the money, it is expensive as that's the only way to have our memories live. No choice but pay the price.Lastly if visiting cancun, this place is must to visit, it takes half day tour and worth the price."

The wetsuit is a must as is the vest they give you, they also provide water shoes which you have to have. But the tour is really awe inspiring. Try to get RAUL as the guide he was fantastic, great personality, speaks excellent English, really loves what he does and it shows. We paid $79 a person on 5th Av. for the tour.

When we arrived at the caves we were met by Alfredo - with a big smile on his face. (side note: it is a 15 minute ride in a large van on a dirt road with LOTS of pot holes - some people may feel a little car sick)You could just tell that he loved his job. He gave us a short intro, then we got changed, showered and set up with equipment before we went down into the cave. There were only 8 of us in the group. There are several different entrances, so it's only one group at a time in each section. You don't see or hear any other groups.The caves themselves are a different world! Absolutely gorgeous. There was a photographer that follows the group, and takes pictures of the couples/groups throughout that you can purchase at the end. Alfredo told us a lot of information about the caves, and since we were up front closest to him, we asked a bunch of questions. Alfredo was educated in Texas, and later left his job as a forensic psychologist to come and work in the caves - and it shows how much he loves his job. Thanks so much Alfredo, we won't ever forget this tour!"

One is just a tour of the under ground river which is fantastic but if you take the Reo Secreto plus you get to ride pedal bikes to a spot in the jungle where you rappel down into an underground cavern and a short walk back to the bikes and back where you started to take the river tour. If you are able to I would definitely take the Plus package no one in our group had rappelled before and we all did fine. They were very helpful. The only negative I could say about this tour is that you are not allowed to take a camera with you they say the bright light has negative affect on the stalagmites but there is a photographer that follows the tour taking lots of pictures that you can buy on a CD at the end of your tour. The price per picture is 25.00 US or you can purchase the whole CD for I think around 80.00. I did purchase one photo and the quality is quite good. Again this is one excursion you have to do while in the area."

My cousin and I picked this excursion based off the TripAdvisor reviews and it was everyone's favorite. We made a fun game of trying to high five on the bumpy roads. Then you get suited up and go to the shaman and he blesses you before you go in the cave. The water is cold, which is why you have a wetsuit and you'll forget about the cold. The pictures are $25 per photo or $75 for the whole disk which has amazing professional landscape photos also, about the same price as other places photos but after seeing the photos on the disk we had to get it. However Ro did make the trip, he was so knowledgeable, friendly and helpful to those who had trouble getting around. A few people in our group have booked this trip many times and loved it. I am going to do the same when back in Cancun! Oh and the lunch was good too!"

            "review": "Special experience!. A trip to this region of Mexico would not be complete with our experiencing a cenote, an underground river. Rio Secreto was recommended by the hotel tour company as being one of the better ones to experience. Our pick up was on time, but what should have taken 30 minutes ended up taking over an hour. We were the first of three stops for pick up and traffic in Playa del Carmen is terrible. At the last hotel, the person didn't even show up. By the time we got to Rio Secreto we were a bit wary. We waited at the welcome area to see if more people would show up and luckily for us, only one did so we had a small group pf five for our tour. The van took us 7 km into the jungle on a dirt road that sits atop the caves. Clearly, this organization is intent on preserving what is natural and that was really impressive. We had an excellent guide, Carine, who prepared us for our underground tour with wet suits, water shoes and helmets. I suggest you take the walking stick. We didn't and the floor but we saw how it helped the others in our group. We descended into the cave and stood in awe of the solitude and beauty. Stalagmites and stalactites everywhere, crystal clear water and two million years of history around you. Carine guided us up and down, at times walking, at times swimming. A photographer accompanied us and took some photos, which we did not end up buying. The memories are stuck in our minds and that was plenty for us, especially with the price of their photo packages. After the caves, we reemerged for a shot of their local liquor and then into dry clothes for lunch in the jungle, which was simple but very tasty. Our trip back to the hotel was much faster and we were happy to have a couple of hours of sun to enjoy after such a special experience. I did provide the feedback about the long trip to Rio Secreto to the driver as well as the hotel tour company, so hopefully others can benefit from that."

The water was cold, but you have a short sleeve wetsuit which helps. To see and learn about the Mayans use of the underground river, as well as the discovery was very interesting, and there's nothing like laying on your back in the water in TOTAL darkness! You wade ankle deep, waist deep, and a couple of times you are swimming (dog paddle) along the river through amazing rock and limestone formations - highly recommended for anyone not afraid of water, close spaces or the dark :)"

We entered through a cenote and travelled through an underground river. We were dressed in a wetsuit, water shoes, a life jacket and a helmut with a headlamp. That headlamp was our only light source. What followed were breathtaking scenes at every turn. Stalactites and stalagmites, crystallized tree roots and a view of untouched natural beauty that has been in development for thousands of years. We were followed by a cameraman who took photos of our excursion and hosted by a knowledgeable guide. I was impressed by the staff's sincere desire to preserve this incredible place. I think anyone who comes to Cancun and is looking for an out of this world experience would be remiss to miss out on this,. If you're staying at a resort - this excursion includes pick up and drop off as well as a free lunch. No need for sunblock on this one."

            "review": "Excellent experience. We absolutely loved our visit to Rio Secreto. It was exciting, educational, and stunningly beautiful. This is not an easy walk in the park. Participants should be able to walk on very uneven surfaces, be comfortable in the water and in some very tight spaces, and be willing to spend a good 1.5 hours underground. Our guide was terrific, keeping track of everyone and ensuring we could all hear and see her at all times. Not an easy task! Absolutely fabulous. I totally understand that they don't allow anything to be brought into the caves in order to keep them pristine. No cameras are allowed. Yes, the pictures are not inexpensive but if you divide the cost between a couple of adults or more, then it can be very reasonable. The pictures are on a CD so you can make as many copies as you want of any photo or send them electronically. They are also very high quality. The only part of the tour that was not perhaps as high a standard as I had expected was the food. It was fine but not well presented, all dishes were chipped or cracked and the people working at the food station did not seem interested in the guests. Our guide, however, remained with us and explained the food, directed us to drinks and organized a table for our group. We loved that our guide met us at the bus and stayed with us the whole time until putting us back on the bus. Our guide, Vero was terrific and her positive attitude and enthusiasm was incredible."

            "review": "The Most Fun You Can Have in a Wet Suit, Life Jacket and Miner's Helmet. Rio Secreto (the secret river) is not like other underground cave tours that you may have taken. For one thing there is a river running through it, and most of the tour has you in the river. Secondly, and perhaps more important, the people who operate the tours have a great deal of respect for the environment. So there are no easy paths cut through the rocks, no handrails and no lights (more about that later). But don't be put off by this stuff; please - keep reading - the place is amazing.The other thing that the people who operate the tours have respect for is the culture of the indigenous Mayan people; and so the tour started (after viewing a short informational video) with a blessing from a Mayan priest. We were then issued wet suits, life jackets, a miner's helmet with a lamp and a walking stick and led to the mouth of the cave.We turned on our helmets lights and started into the cave accompanied by our guide and a photographer. I was initially disappointed that there were no cameras allowed, but soon realized that I needed to direct my full attention to the cave, even if I had taken a camera I wouldn't have taken any pictures.The tour itself was incredible. I could go on for pages about the rock formations, but the moment that will stay with me for the rest of my life is when we were floating down the river and the guide told us to turn off our helmet lights. The absolute darkness was almost palpable. It might sound corny; but between the silence, the darkness and the weightlessness of floating in a life jacket, the only way to describe the experience is mystical. I understood the reverence that the Mayans felt towards the cave.As incredible as it was, the tour is not for everyone. I have bad knees, and I'm not as young as I used to be. If I knew what I know now before I went on the tour, I probably would have taken a pass. But our guide, Lara, was amazing. She was knowledgeable, professional, friendly and incredibly patient. Because of Lara I had an amazing time, I'm glad that I went.So if you don't have any issues with tight spaces or uneven terrain, visiting the Rio Secreto will be the highlight of your vacation."

It is an eco park where you are not allowed to use any chemicals on your body,must shower before the tour and not touch the formations. It is somewhat rugged. First is an~4mile ride over a rutted dirt road into the site. Then you descend down into the river with your wetsuit, life vest and helmet [all provided]. You need to be in decent shape, have reasonably good balance (the river bottom and narrow areas can be very uneven and Boulder strewn. A few places are too deep to walk so you have to swim a few hundred feet. Some places are so uneven that you float on your back and use your hands on the bottom to propel yourself. There are 3 different passages one can take depending on your guide. The tour is about an hour and one half. It is well worth the visit. The lunch is nothing to write home about and the Photo Shots ARE A HUGE RIPPOFF. You can't take picture so a photographer accompanies you and shoots some great shots but at the end the prices they want to charge for even one is nothing but thievery. No one in our group would buy any, they were annoyed."

The natural wonder of the jungle, the caves and the clear, warm underground river was too much to pass on. Our guide Julian and photographer Carla made the trip fun and educational. We found the people who go on these excursions are all fun and look out for each other and by the end of the tour we all had lots in common. The tour starts with a 7km drive into the jungle over bumpy potholes roads but that just adds to the experience. Once there we divide into smaller groups, get changed into our swimsuits and water shoes. After a cold outdoor shower, we are provided with wetsuits, helmets with a light and flotation vests. A short hike later we are given a blessing by a Mayan shaman. Too cool! The first view of the cave entrance and the stairwell down is breathtaking! Not long after we are walking in water, venturing deeper and deeper underground. The formations you see are absolutely other worldly and floating and swimming in that clear, warm pure water definitely adds to it. The guides make the most with the few lights we carry into the caverns and when the lights are shut off it is blacker than anything you have ever experienced. The first time we came (last year) the group had to hold hands, this time it was better...we we given walking sticks and got to walk on our own...be sure to get a longer one! At least shoulder height, it helps to feel the slight drops in steps in the water. Mine was too short and I had to bend over to get my balance. The hike is very safe but I suppose one should be in moderate shape and agile as to not stumble into the walls and formations. The path is defined by string to keep people from damaging fragile areas and care is taken to advise everyone not to touch the rock because the oils in our skin will stop the formation process of the stalagmites. We were only underground for about an hour and a half but it seemed way longer. It does take some energy out of you so a lunch was a welcome sight. We had signed up for the tour plus which meant we went back underground a second time after lunch. This time we got to ride some sketchy but fun mountain bikes down the a couple of km to a different area, rappel down 25 feet into another cave, hiked and swam a while, biked back to the first site. By this time it was just my brother and I and a bunch of guides and the photographer. It was like a personal tour! So much fun! We had one final cave to enter, and it was a dry one so we got changed into our regular clothes. It was spectacular as well, we ended our tour with a film and light show projected on the rock walls. The tour Plus was worth the extra bucks! We heard some complaints about the cost of the photographs, but for us it was fine.They were professionally done, burned on a disk and we also bought 3 t-shirts for $109US. I would highly recommend this tour, it is quite an experience and the people were first rate!"

(systemic rheumatoid arthritis) to the guide because I'm stubborn, I didn't want to be dissuaded, and I want to do as much as I can while I can. So now you can learn from my experience. The trek in by bus from gate to entrance is only a few kilometres, but it's on the worst roads I've never imagined. I'm sure there are trucking roads on the hillsides of Bolivian mountains that are better than this one, and there are tv shows on how treacherous those are. The trek inside the caves is long and often difficult for someone with R.A.; up and over, a bit of climbing here and there, nowhere to sit down and rest, and it's a long way, but the guide does stop to tell you about your surroundings. And then you get to swim in the cool waters underground and it's totally worth it. Everything is so quiet and peaceful, and I just felt grateful that I was there to experience it. But then you have to climb out and up some stairs with your heavy wetsuit on - eat some really great food - then take that cursed road back to the gate. I don't know if I would do it again, only because I really paid for it physically later. If someone had told me how difficult it really was, I wouldn't have done it. I went in 100% committed to getting through it on my own, and I don't know if there is any other exit along the way, so keep that in mind. Just loved it."

When we booked the tour with Bookit the gentleman taking our reservation confused me on the time the tour bus would pick us up. He first said it would be 9:00am and then said 8:00. We booked the tour days in advance. The morning of the tour we went and had breakfast and thought we had plenty of time to meet the bus in front ofthe hotel. Well when we got back to our room there was a message that the bus was waiting for us. We made a mad dash for the front of the hotel that was a good 1/4 mile through the jungle. When we got there, the driver was patiently waiting for us with guests from other resorts. We apologized to the driver and the other guests. I thought we had until 9:00 but it was 8:00. This was the only glitch of the trip. And I'm soo glad they waited for us and didn't leave us. The caves are amazing and this was the neatest thing I've ever done. Our guide was really a great guide. I think his name was Pablo. One of the things he did was take us into one of the caverns rooms and shut off the lights. We were in about 15' of water. We laid back, closed our eyes and listened to the sounds of the cave. It was so relaxing. Much like an isolation chamber. After this experience was over, started our ascent up out of the cave. Pablo said the room and trail we were taking was called the womb and the birth canal. The reason was by this time we had been in the cave alittle over an hour. Our senses had been dulled due to a constant temperture in the cave and very little smells. As we ascended he said to really pay attention to our senses. First thing I noticed was the temperature change. Next the smells of the tropical flowers, vegatation and the Mayan lunch that was waiting for us. Then the brightness of the outside light. He compared this to a baby that is being born and experiencing these senses for the first time. It was awesome....I loved ever minute. Definitely The Tour of a Lifetime."

They were very accommodating about last minute bookings. Our tour guide, Carlos, was amazing! They was a 50m section of the save that was quite narrow- I freaked out and Carlos was amazing and distracted me and calmed me down!! Carlos remembered all our names and made us feel like a family! The only downside was that you can't take your own photos and the cost to buy the photos is US$50! Which for an Australian is a lot of money! The buffet lunch was spectacular either. Other than that it is a must see!"

This is the place! Ever wanted to feel like an Indiana Jones? This is the place! Want to enjoy a moment in time? Rio Secreto is the place They will provide you with all the necessary equipment and provide lunch too. No need to bring towels, no need to bring your water slippers. Just bring your thirst for knowledge, being one with nature with the sense of adventure. If you are lucky, ask Alfredo who is very knowledgable, passionate and knows his craft"

Our guide, Jorge, was friendly, informative, well trained and patient with our group, helping anyone who needed it. Really enjoyed walking through the cave, around the formations, in and out of the water. The equipment kept us warm while walking and swimming. Excellent snack afterwards, more like a lunch, food was good but watch out for the green salsa! It is not guacamole!! The only damper on my experience was at the end. A photographer goes with your group, as cameras are not allowed during the trip, and takes photos while on the tour. At the end, there are young men who show you the photos with the intention of selling you copies or packages. it was not well communicated what was necessary to order photos if you want them, and I could not order them in time when I was ready to leave. I felt that I was not paid attention to or assisted, and ended up having to order on the internet later. Frustrating, however other than that, the trip was amazing."

The information the guides provide is no talltale, it is 100% accurate. I have always been deeply interested in geology and I can tell you they've got their facts straight. There is a mayan guy with them that does some sort of ritual previous to starting the tour, this also looks legit. (Not like the guys playing mayas at some other tours, if you know what I mean) This tour opperator shiwa respect to nature and local culture and traditions, by not treating them like some sort of circus-like attraction.Now, let's talk about the food. It is not the typical \"foreign-tourist targeted\" kind of stuff. It's cooked by locals and it is extremelly delicious, though the dinnig area doesn't look that impresive.You cannot miss this tour!"

You take about an hour walk and swim through the incredible cave. It was one of the most tranquil and beautiful part of our trip. Our guide Julio was the best (for English speaking tours). He was kind, helpful, funny, and just a great person. He taught us so much about the caves and it's significance to Mayan culture.

            "review": "Absolutely Amazing!. This is one of the best tours that I have ever done! I am somewhat familiar with the Mayan genesis story in the Popol Vuh and had heard of Xibalba but I never thought that I would have the opportunity to come and see a gateway to Xibalba. Xibalba is the Mayan underworld. This nature preserve is about 0.5 hour away from Playa del Carmen. I came here with my wife, who has RA, and my 11 year old son and my teenage sister. Our guides name was Julio Caesar or JC. JC was very professional and informative along every step of the tour. All of the guides spoke English very well. Upon arrival we were greeted and given a brief overview of the \"cenote\" and what to expect. The word cenote comes from Yucatec Maya \"dzonot\" or \"ts'onot\" meaning \"well\". We had an opportunity to use the restroom first which my wife and son were very appreciative of after our bumby taxi ride out. Rio Secreto provided us with lockers and padlocks for all of our stuff. They do not allow you to bring ANYTHING into the cenote including cameras. They do have a photographer that is with each group and stops you for pictures throughout the tour. The photography is the only gripe I have about this tour. I wish the photographer would have taken better pictures. Nobody in my group of 9 bought more than one picture. My family bought only one group photo just to commemorate the day, others didn't buy any. We received our included water socks, then it was off for a fresh spring shower to rinse off all the oils and chemicals on your body. Do yourself and the nature preserve a favor and don't wear any sunblock, deodorant, or bug repellent before you come here, its all going to get washed off anyway before you can enter the cenote. We all then we sized for our wet suits. JC was on the money for sizing my whole family first try. After getting our wet suits on an we were given life jackets and helmets with head lamps. The wet suits are actually spring suits or shortys, short sleeve and shorts style. The life jackets are a ski style versus the dorky orange one we all wore as kids. ;p and the helmets are actually petzls climbing helmets. They have definitely invested in some good gear. We then walked a short distance down a very well maintained trail to where a Mayan ah-pul-yaah, the \u201cdisease thrower\u201d had to first bless us before our entrance into the cenote. This blessing is not about your or my religion but the respect of another cultures reverence for this place. The Maya would not enter before being blessed and neither will you. After the blessing it was a short distance more to the stairs leading down into the cenote.The water in the cenote is crystal clear and cold. I will say it again the water is cold, but worth every minute of it. Through out the tour you will go from walking to wading, swimming to squating. You will experience complete and TOTAL darkness. There are many tripping hazards and chances to test your helmet if your not paying attention. If you are comfortable with these movements, experiences, and environments then get ready for one of the most unforgettable experiences of your life. What else should you expect from the Mayan Underworld. After the tour was over we toasted with a Mayan drink called Xtabent\u00fan, which is an anise and feremented honey liqueur. They then provided an assortment of traditional Mayan meals to choose from with fresh hot tortillas. I loved the soup! After lunch we lounged in one of the 20 hammocks that they have strung up all over waiting for our taxi ride back to the city.Pro Tips: 1. I did see someone in another group with a GoPro4 on his wrist. I know the reason they don't allow cameras is so nothing has a chance of getting lost but also so they can charge you for the photos at the end. The wrist attachment should eliminate the chance of losing the camera.2. When doing the swimming portion put your feet out in front of you and use your arms to swim, like your swimming through rapids. I like to keep one leg straight out and the other bent at a 45* at the knee. There are many stalagmites under the water surface that you can not see. Your bare skin against the rock surface.... you won't be happy. 3. Take your time! Watch your step there are many stalagmites on the path and you will trip or at least bang a toe at some point. 4. The pictures are $75USD for the whole disk. At that price I would ask the photographer to take some extra pictures of your group, I wish that I would have had more pictures that I liked.5. The revenue generated by the tours and photography packages go to help fund the nature preserve, the guides live off of your tips!! Show some love!!"

I booked three excursions, one from each of the top companies on trip advisor. Rio Secreto was gorgeous and a fun half day adventure for those who don't want to lose the whole day. Since it is mainly underground I would wait until a rainy day to go-- we went on a sunny day and had rain three of the next 5 days. I was surprised at how uneven the ground was and tricky to navigate it was. There was a 60 year ish lady in our group who really struggled. There are times when you drop three feet; sometimes you are fully submerged and other times you are not in water at all. I will say our other two excursions had cenotes and while they weren't pitch black, we got the general idea so this was a little bit overkill. If you aren't doing another excursion then this will be great! So just make sure you aren't doing duplicates."

After a 45-minute ferry ride we were escorted by our guide Tomas and other staff to the Rio Secreto in a minivan, about a half hour drive. Our guide Tomas was excellent, giving information about the area and region, sharing about himself, and cracking jokes. The caves are a tourist attraction but it is out in the middle of nowhere so does not feel too commercialized. We went out in groups of 8 after getting all our equipment. The tour was a perfect combination of adventurous, fun, educational, and safe. We learned a lot and got some exercise. Lunch afterward was also excellent. I agree with some other customers that it is a pity the pictures cost so much. They wouldn't let my husband take his camera, and they charge 79$ for the photos. Usually on activities like this we expect to be able to buy the photos for much less. Otherwise it was a great excursion!"

Our guide (Jorge) was excellent. He was very informative and guided us every step of the way. You walk through the caverns which are filled with water. Mostly around 3 feet (1 meter) deep although part of the time it's deeper than that and you do have to swim for 10-15 minutes but with a life vest you are really just floating and paddling. I'm not a great swimmer but had no issues. The cavern is beautiful inside and Jorge did a great job showing us around his \"office\". Highly recommend this tour."

Our guide, who was a woman from Montreal but whose name i sadly cannot remember... was fantastic. Our group was a mix of children, 2 elderly women, and adults and could have been very complicated but she made it simple and easy for everyone. She offered great information about the cenote and interacted well with everyone. Towards the end when the water becomes deep she even helped one woman float through the rest of the tour, guiding us, explaining the things we were seeing, and floating the woman along as we went. It lent a fun and carefree atmosphere to a dark and mysterious cave experience making it even more enjoyable. The cave and river are amazing. Everything is so beautiful down there. It's been well preserved and they work hard to keep things as natural as possible. We were able to see and experience things that not everyone has ever seen and at the end we were able to go through a very small, very deep part of the cave that both entranced and terrified me at times. But I was able to complete it and left with a sense of accomplishment I'd never had before. You can really step out of your comfort zone here if you want to and learn about and explore a part of the world you might not see again. As a side note: you are provided with a wet suit, life vest, and safety hat. They will also provide you with water shoes if you forget yours. (bring your own if you can - they fit better) They also provide you with a towel and lunch and drinks at the end. The wetsuits are not attractice but luckily there are no mirrors when you put them on so you don't know that you may or may not look like a pregnant Sea Lion until you review the photos later. They have a professional photographer accompany the tour because no cameras or items that can be lost in the cave are allowed. It's a preserve and I'm ok with this. I also think its a great way for them to make money. The photos of the cave were excellent. The photos of me were not... but that's because of the wet suit. Not our cool photographer. He did an excellent job!! Another note: It's a bit of a journey to the cave. You take a shuttle into the jungle and then get dressed in your self esteem negating wet suits and then walk through the jungle a bit until you reach the cave. Also, our tour was about 2 hours long so it can be strenuous if you have leg, back, or hip issues. they have cool walking sticks and i highly recommend them just to give you some support while trying to maneuver through the cave in low light and unsteady footing at times. It's not slippery though, as pointed out by our awesome guide, there is no photosynthesis so no slippery algae or anything like that. But, sometimes a step is deeper than you expect or a rock is in your way that you don't expect. If you do anything at all - take this tour!! It was the best!!"

The tourguides are quite knowledgeable, and you can schedule your tour with one who speaks English. Some reviewers refer to it as \"Bucket List\". I would not quite call it that, but it's cool as hell, and kids love it. The one negative is that you cannot take photos, and they charge another $80 for the CD of the photos their professional photographer takes -- nobody buys it, so I thin they need a margin-pricing MBA to explain to them that they'd sell 200 per day at $15, and only 2 or 3 per day at $80, but hey, they charge what they charge, and you can show your friends Google Images of the caves instead of succumbing to their extortion.

Shortie wetsuits, life jackets, water shoes, walking sticks (very useful) and towels were all provided. We changed, took a shower and then walked to an area where we had a short Mayan ceremony and then proceeded to the underground cave. A photographer was provided as we were not allowed to take in any photographic equipment (including GoPros). It ended up being fine as we needed both of our hands most of the time anyway as the footing was pretty uneven most of the way. The cost of the photos is pretty steep ($10 per photo or $135 for the USB of all photos), but our guy got many great shots. Our guide, Diego, was very knowledgable and did a great job. We spent about an hour and a half in the cave itself. For those who are claustrophobic, there really weren't any tight spots until the end when we had to swim/float through an area with a very low ceiling. My 72 year-old in-laws came along and really enjoyed the whole experience - although they did need assistance at some points when climbing up or getting into lower pools. We were a little chilled by the end, but warmed up quickly when we got back to the surface. After changing we had a locally prepared meal that was quite good."

We learned about stalactites and stalagmites as we walked and swam through this cave system. Headlights, lifejackets, and wetsuits were provided. I would suggest to bring your own watershoes as we did. The experience of turning off our headlamps and being in total darkness heightened the senses and was very memorable."

It was about a 20 min taxi ride from the hotel. When we arrived, we were a little concerned by the amount of people there. However, Rio Secreto very efficiently divided people into small groups for the van ride and cave tour. Our guide Romain, did a wonderful job guiding us on the bilingual tour and ensuring our little guy (5 yo) was safe and happy. The secret river was incredible...truly a once in a lifetime experience! We were pleasantly surprised by the buffet lunch that followed. When trying the salsa...proceed with caution! The only drawback is that there is no way to take personal pictures. The company has a photographer that follows the group and takes lots of pictures. One picture is $25 and the whole set is $79. We chose a pic, but forgot to pick it up, so no family picture for us. : ("

Our tour guide (Lu) was very sweet, engaging, and helpful to the older guests that needed assistance. They don't advertise how \"active\" this trip is as it requires some pretty decent walking / balancing on rocks in the river (for us it was just fine, but more elderly visitors should be warned)! We loved the atmosphere and calm of the underground river. Food was basic but very good. I would have given 5 stars if not for the RIDICULOUS price for photos. We would have loved to buy, but for $80 (for a CD) or $25 (for 1 photo) the quality of photos wasn't worth it. Such a shame. It was a bit of a \"downer\" after such a nice trip to the caverns...would have been nice to end on a high note."

OK, OK, if you must go you'll have a wonderful small-group adventure, see amazing things, learn interesting facts, meet knowledgeable guides (ours put a scorpion on his hand); but then you'll tell everyone and it'll get crowded (like the Crystal Caves in Belize) and not as much fun. We spent about 1.5 hrs in the cave. Apparently there's a longer 6 hour tour, which would be quite an adventure and I'd love to do. Our visit was an excursion from Norwegian Cruise Lines, and was one of the highlights of the cruise. It's the real deal!"

The beautiful formations and transition from green jungle to total darkeness are very impressive. What I liked the most was that the caverns were not illuminated, the only source of light were the lanterns in our helmets. There was even a moment where we turned off the lights and were submerged in total darkness and silence. The only negatives are the buffet, which is not really varied, and the price of the photos, which is extremely high."

The ride to get there was terrible. The road is so bumpy and full of pot holes. The drivers have to weave all over the road to get there and it was not a short ride once inside Rio Secreto. Also at the end, we had to wait over an hour for other guests whose hotels were near ours for a ride back. They started their tours way after us and it was frustrating to have to wait so long when all we wanted to do was go back. The guide took the group on another tour to a walking cave to help with the wait, but it was still an inconvenience, especially with how much you pay to go there."

Now we are told there are at least 3 paths with more on the way. You are fitted up in knee length wet suits, helmets with lights, and water shoes and enter the cave in small groups--Our group was 8. Remembering how slippery the cave is inside--we chose a walking stick this time and were glad of it. The path thru the cave consists of walking on land, walking in the water, and some swimming. The cave formations are breathtaking--but it's the experience of swimming in this crystal clear water which is so exciting. There are plenty of opportunities to step in holes, slip, and slide so don't do this tour unless you have decent balance and are able to stoop, climb and reach. My one slip and fall was luckily in the water (it turned out to be a spectacular cannon-ball type of fall). The exit to the particular path we were on was tricky to navigate--we basically had to back float--keeping the top of the cave a safe 2 inches from our faces. Not a tour for anyone with claustrophobia. This tour is definitely not to be missed.After the tour--there is a complimentary shot of Mayan Tequila as well as lunch. They have clean bathrooms and a changing facility."

It's an underground passage way with spring waters to wade, float and walk through while viewing stalactites and stalagmites and other formations. It was only recently discovered (by accident) in the last 8 years. Our guide, Alondra, was hysterical and informative. We highly recommend asking for her by name. She was the best guide at the adventure. The excursion starts with a short video about the location, followed by a short walk to get your gear (wet suit, life jacket, water socks and helmet with attached light, all,included in the price). You then get a locked looker for your valuables and then head by a short walk in small groups of 6-10 to the site, after stopping for a brief ceremony (5 minutes) before heading down into the site. You then walk, crawl a little, wade, float and climb underground about 1/2 mile through the site. It's an amazing experience and well worth a visit. No cameras are allowed as they sell pictures at the end of the excursion, taken by a photographer who accompanies you on the excursion. Don't miss this, and remember to ask for Alondra!"

I tripped once, because I was eager to see the bats, but my guide found a fresh aloe plant as soon as we got out of the cave and ripped of the tip to rub on my bloody knee. Lunch was buffet style- all you could eat, and delicious!! It was very simple to travel with them because they provided lockers and keys and a changing area. The helmets, flashlights and wetsuits were all good quality. They took pictures for us and sold them at the end. The licorice liquor to warm up was amazing.

You clambour, wade, and swim within the Earth, experiencing nature. Pretty freakin' awesome. There are some tight spaces to navigate and if you're scared of swimming maybe reconsider, but even then they are so accommodating and it's just so damn cool that Rio Secreto is a perfect place for you to conquer your fears. Before going into the cave you are given the option of bringing along a walking stick. DO IT!

Ever been to a cave before? Well, it's like that except being wet most of the time. After being dropped off at the entrance by a taxi we filled out some paperwork and were then placed into vans for a fairly bumpy ~15 minute ride to a facility close to the cave entrance where you are provided with special shoes, a wetsuit, lifejacket, helmet with light, locker to store your stuff and a guide. You then wade (mostly), swim (a bit) and walk (a bit) through the cave system for 1.5 hours, stopping for pictures taken by an accompanying photographer and information from the guide about cave system and Mayan culture. Then you head back to change clothes, buy photos if you want and eat a pretty decent buffet lunch (soup, rice, pasta, scrambled eggs, fruit). The whole operation is very well organized and the staff, as typified by our excellent guide Diana, is quite friendly. How much you enjoy this attraction will probably vary from person to person. If you've never been to a cave before, or are a cave enthusiast, this may be a cool and interesting way to experience it. But if you've been to a number caves before (I've been to Sung Sot in Vietnam and Waitomo Caves in New Zealand), this one may not seem all that exceptional, unless swimming your way through some semi-brisk (\"refreshing\" is the glass half-full way of looking at it) water underground sounds like something you'd really be into. I'll also add that at one point during the tour everyone floats together with zero illumination -- it's absolutely pitch black. While a number of reviewers found it really interesting as it heightened one's other senses, I couldn't wait for it to be over -- that's just me.So, in summary, I'd just say this is probably a case of everyone having their own unique preferences. My sister who went with me on the tour found it \"pretty cool\" while I was less enthusiastic. Maybe you'd love this attraction or maybe you'd wish you'd just stayed on the beach. At $79/pop for the entrance, just make sure to think it over before booking."

Once all \"geared up\" our very knowledgable guide, Alejandro (Alex) took us through the Cenote, describing the history, geology and ecology. We had all been through caves in the USA and Europe but nothing like this. With wet and dry sections it required nimble feet and a good amount of wading that added to the adventure. Loved the swimming section and the special experience near the end. Never felt the presence of other groups. The assigned guide stays with your group the entire tour including making sure you're outfitted, safe through the cave, cleaned up, fed and of course given the chance to buy your photos (no personal cameras permitted). The photo package is probably the only negative of the whole event. We were a group of 8 (our two families of 4) and should have been offered a single package, not be required to buy two packages just to get everyone's picture. The package is expensive enough without having to buy a second. It is a nice compilation of your tour and stock cave photos (123 pics). All in all a great experience and a nice break from the sun and surf."

We had a great time exploring the caves with our comedic and knowledgeable tour guide Andres. Along the way - a photographer comes along and takes photos at various intervals. At the end of the tour a family was curious to know what the cost was for photos taken, and our guide was reluctant to divulge that info - we soon discovered the reason for this hesitation. Turns out if you want a single photo on a CD that costs $25USD, meanwhile a CD with all the photos can be attained for a low-low price of $70 (or $60 or $50USD - this changed several times throughout the conversations I had.) Needless to say no photos were able to be purchased at the advertised price. My advice for those considering the Rio Secreto is to ignore the on-tour photographer unless you have more money than you know what to do with. Otherwise we had an enjoyable experience that was unfortunately ruined by the irrationally high prices at exit."

We had a great guide Juano (Alex). He was so relaxed, confident and knowledgeable. It made the excursion that much better. It was raining the day we went, so it was perfect to be 60 feet below the surface. Each cave and underground river has unique features. We repelled down into the second cave, which was exciting and something new. There is a cool light show in the final cave as well. If you go, make sure you get the \"Plus\" package so you can have the option to see all three caves. Otherwise, you just have the first cave. The whole excursion was about 5 hours long. It is well worth the time and money!"

Somehow we found out about this preserve and since I am an adventurer at heart it sounded very unique. It is truly a NATIONAL TREASURE that Mexico should take the greatest care to preserve. However the world knows that most likely will not happen. Thank goodness some private and savvy individuals have already done this by setting up the park. I am not a cave explorer by any means however the natural beauty of the different crystal formations, the sheer immensity of this underground treasure and the crystal clear waters will amaze your senses. Our guide Valentino took special care to explain the history and significance if this natural phenomenon that provides 20% of the entire countries water supply. I was wondering why the tap water at the hotel tasted so good.... it is supplied from here. I hope that the government of Mexico cherishes this blessing and cares for it for future generations. You are not allowed to take any pictures while in the underground river... probably for safety reasons... you can easily trip and gash your head open with the many formations that are everywhere. I bought the book at the end which captures the beauty of this sacred place. This is a tour you should do if you only do one tour your entire trip. It is not extremely strenuous but does require that you pay attention to your footings the entire time. If you are a total couch potatoe this tour might be a bit of a workout for you, however for the vast majority it should be a nice walk/ez hike."

Depending on water level when you go, you may be walking through water up to neck - deep or swimming. Julio is an amazing tour guide and takes time to explain the scientific and cultural meanings of the site. For the more fit and adventurous, there's a 5 hr tour that includes biking to remote center and repelling down into the caverns."

We toured the Palaces cave where there is a lot of water to go through. It was fantastic! I thought I would be slightly claustrophobic but had no problems at all.

You have to be in fairly good shape as there is a lot of walking over uneven terrain and occasional squatting. I highly recommend using the walking stick for balance since they do not want you to touch anything in the cave. There is also a fairly short walk to the cave entrance and stairs you have to descend. They provide you with a wet suit, water shoes (although if you have your own water shoes I would recommend you wear them), helmet with a light, and a life jacket. There is swimming involved, but if you can dog paddle that is sufficient. No cameras are allowed but you are followed the entire time by a photographer so at the end of the tour you have the option to purchase pictures. I purchased the CD which not only had our pictures but other pictures taken inside the cave. The time spent in the cave is an hour and a half. We were then provided with an excellent buffet style lunch with drinks. This was an excursion taken from a cruise ship so I don't know if food is always provided."

The tours are done in groups of 10 and well paced, so that you don't connect with, or hear, any other groups. The 15 minute ride up to the river is the road from hell, with massive potholes, which our driver skillfully dodged, but that entailed a LOT of swerving. If you get motion sick, be prepared! The trip through the river is varied and very uneven, as one reviewer complained. It is a NATURAL wonder, so they haven't hacked away rock formations for the convenience of tourists - it was splendid! The water level varied from non existent, to deep enough that we had to swim. I'm a weak swimmer, but with a mandatory life jacket, I had no problem at all. My guide Diana, made numerous stops, explaining the formations and natural fauna. There was an opportunity to handle some broken stalactites and stalagmites - otherwise, it was hands off! Natural body oils discolor them over time and touching them can cause fissures that weaken them. I would definitely not take children who are unruly, have difficulty staying focused or tend not to listen (just sayin'!)Yes, there were the obligatory pictures taken by the photographer and they're costly, but I'm glad they don't allow tourists to take pictures. The constant flashing of cameras would have detracted greatly from the experience. Resolution on the personal pictures that I purchased was a bit grainy.Diana regularly warned us of areas that were challenging and helped group members (me specifically!) if they were having trouble navigating. There are 3 different routes that can be taken, so I would definitely take this trip again! It was an unforgettable experience and the highlight of my trip to Mexico!"

It is an underwater cave that is filled with jaw-dropping eco views of stalactite and stalagmite formations. Every twist and turn brought a new nature/Mayan-inspired marvel. The tour guide, Miguel, was patient and his stories made the tour even more fascinating. At the end was a buffet lunch with authentic Yucatan-inspired cuisine. I must stress that you be extremely fit. Prior to entering the cave is a hike along rough terrain and once in the cave, the walking requires one to dodge rocks. There is swimming and, even though you wear a life vest, you must be able to swim. But, you must be fit so if you're not, you will find this overwhelming. The other issue is the picture taking. You cannot take your camera (that is understandable) and there is a professional photographer who goes on the tour to take pictures. At the end, you are charged $79.95 for a disk, which features many on the tour as well as individual shots. I opted to buy two of my own shots rather than shell out $80.00. Including the transportation there and the entrance fee, you spend upwards of $130. Add the photos and you're at over $210\u2026if you get the full package. Overall, I enjoyed this eco-adventure but would have liked to know about the financial obligations upfront. Also, you do not want to do this on your own. You MUST have a guide!"

The first portion of the tour involved approximately 10 individuals where we put on wetsuits, life jackets and ventured into Rio Secreto. The sights were beautiful. Diego, our tour guide couldn't have been nicer, more knowledgeable or accommodating. It's refreshing to find a tour guide that appreciates the sights and sounds and isn't just going through the motion of getting tourists in and out. He was a true delight. We signed up for the under advertised Plus package (only 2 of the 10 continued on with the tour) which included repelling into a cenote and walking through another underground cave. We would highly recommend doing the Plus portion. It's not something you can do everyday...well maybe Diego can. Lucky him."

I had done the cave swimming at Xplor previously and thought this would be similar. I was very wrong - this was much more natural, less commercialized, more extensive. These caves are absolutely amazing and the vast majority of what you see is totally natural, unmodified by people, including that fact that there is no permanent lighting (the photo was taken with a very bright flash). Our guide Alfredo was incredibly knowledgable and very entertaining. We did the Plus Tour, which included a repel into a cave, and it was totally worth the extra money. Of all the Riviera Maya area attractions I've visited, I would recommend Rio Secreto the highest."

Although it could have ben great for us (a couple in our 30s), it was inappropriate for both the kids and our parents. This place is best for people from probably 7 to 60. Despite reading through the website and other people's reviews, it was not clear how technical some of the cave exploration would be. Yes, they give you a walking stick (anyone over 50ish or so should definitely take the stick), but there are several areas that require technical angling of your body and skilled footwork that our little kids and parents could not do on their own. There was constant hand holding and slipping. 4 people drew blood slipping on the slippery limestone. If you've ever visited cenotes before, this is totally different. You aren't just floating with flippers on when you visit Rio Secreto. Here, you are actively exploring caves with extremely uneven ground. The experience was fantastic, but unfortunately in our case the beauty and wonder of the experience was overshadowed by the fact that 4 of the 6 of us had a very difficult time maneuvering through the caves. Also, the photos were horrible. Since we couldn't bring our camera in (which is a great policy), I was hopeful that the photographer would take good photos. The photos taken of our group were really disappointing. They were blurry and taken with basically no skill. Door to door, the visit was about 6 hours and definitely could have been made shorter into 4.5 or 5 hours if there wasn't so much waiting around."

Cave is so incredibly beautiful and I felt honored to experience. Moderately Strenuous...with a few very big steps and some places are slippery. Take the shoes they have- mine did not have enough traction and I really needed help in a few spots - l was so greatful for our photographer and guide as they made even the more challenging parts fun. This is a natural cave which means no \"paths\", and no handholds since it is a living cave site. Take the walking stick and wear the shoes provided!Not a tour for cranky children and kids need to be able to appreciate how they can damage CENTURIES of growth if they touch...I only recommend for older children who can really appreciate the awesome beauty. We had a really great group, and the sacredness of the site was felt by all. Will carry the memory of this treasured place with me - awe inspiring and worthy of the few minor aches the next day!"

The weather was very windy so where better to go but under ground. We arrived and thought we were at the caves but no, they take you in a van through the jungle (about 20 minutes) to the entrance of the caves. Rio Secreto supplies you with water shoes, life vest, helmet with head lamp, and a wet suit. I think our guide was Carlos and he was very good. The caves were amazing and swimming in them was an awesome experience - especially when all the lights were off and it was pitch black - you wait for your eyes to adjust but that doesn't happen because there is no light coming from anywhere. The stalactites and stalagmites were amazing - incredible formations! I highly recommend this tour which is perfect for non beach or non pool day."

There were 2 Rio Secreto guides waiting to take us by van to the cave They do advise that it is a bumpy ride. The Tour guide Fernando, did not talk the whole way which I thought was a little upsetting, he was on his phone the whole ride. Once we arrived to the Rio Secreto we were met with our tour guide Fernanda. She is very informative in answering questions and just providing the history of the Underground heaven. We were on a time block but Fernanda asked if we wanted to take longer in the cave and we all agreed to see more. I absolutely loved this excursion. The pictures on the Excursion do not do justice, It is a must see in person, this is a once in a lifetime experience that I will never forget. You are provided with a wet suit, life jacket and helmet with a head lamp There is a few parts that are deep where you need to swim but the water is refreshing, not cold at all. You will be happy choosing this excursion."

Unfortunately, this makes my review a little different in regards to booking and transport, but hopefully this helps someone! Rio Secreto staff picked us up in three vans at the pier in Playa del Carmen, and took us to the site. I was still feeling a little seasick from the ferry when they arrived, but the driver was accommodating and let me sit in the front seat. The drive from the pier was about 20-25 minutes, with about half of it over very bumpy roads. In spite of the terrain, the drivers were very careful, drove slowly, and clearly were very familiar with the route. When we arrived, we were introduced to our guide, Victor, who fitted each of us with a wetsuit, life vest, and helmet with a head lamp. Victor was a great guide; very knowledgeable and personable! (Also very gracious with me as I needed to take a moment to finish getting my bearings from being sick!) Our guide did a great job of managing time during our tour and explaining that the more time we took on the tour, the more rushed we would be changing, cleaning up, and eating before being shuttled back to the pier. The tour itself was an unforgettable, once-in-a-lifetime experience!! There is a bit of walking and a bit of swimming on the route that we took. The river system was discovered not long ago, so they are still mapping it out. To date, they have a total of 15 miles mapped out in three different routes that they alternate taking people through. Although it is dark, the headlamps provide ample light and at no point are you placed in a position that would require \"squeezing\" through. The formations on the ceilings above and the walls are unbelievable! The water of the river is crystal clear and felt quite refreshing without being cold. I really don't have words to properly describe it....it simply must be seen to comprehend. After our tour, we had ample time to change clothes, have a delicious buffet lunch of true, homemade Mexican food,(soup, rice, chicken, pasta, taco makings, and fruit) and relax in the hammocks. My only complaint of the experience is that since you are not allowed to bring any cameras into the cave (including water-proof or underwater cameras) if you would like a photographic momento of your tour, you have to buy their disc. We did, and the photos on it are wonderful, high-quality photos taken by the professional photographer who accompanied our tour and some scenery and wildlife from the surrounding jungle. However, I do wish that it could be produced at a slightly lower cost. Overall, this is a fantastic experience that should not be missed!!!"

It is very close to Playa del Carmen (10 min driving). The organization of the welcome area is outstanding, good services, explanations, etc. After the introduction you board a van for 25 minutes to reach the excursion area. What you experience in the excursion is difficult to compare with any other tour: you visit an underground cave complex to discover the \"secret river\", you see stalactites, stalagmites also small mollusk if you have avid eyes and swim in this marvelous environment. The tour includes a buffet lunch after which is very basic (but not enough to reduce one star to the whole experience). Then for US$55 you can buy a CD with the pictures a pro photographer took of you during the whole excursion (which I found very worth because you cannot bring your camera inside the cave). All together an experience that we will remember during the years to come."

Andres, our tour guide, was amazing. He was very friendly, spoke excellent English, knew a lot about the cave, and was able to take us places not every group gets to go because our group was very quick moving through the caves and because the water was very high that day. Our photographer, Jose, was also very good, following us along the way to take pictures of each couple. The lunch we were given was delicious! We loved the chicken tortilla soup and the cactus! We even got to take a shot of a local liquor with out group. We had a great experience at Rio Secreto. The only downsides we saw were the price of the pictures and the VERY bumpy drive to the cave entrance. I get car sick pretty easily, and the bumpy 7 km drive into the jungle was pretty terrible. Once we got there, everything was fantastic. I don't know if it is possible for them to pave that road, but it would have made the experience more pleasant. As for the pictures, we would have liked to buy all of our pictures, but they were too expensive. We did buy two to remember our honeymoon, but I don't think we would have bought any of it were a regular vacation trip. "

We were concerned about being claustrophobic, also about the water being too cold, but none of those things were true, it was just an absolutely lovely place. Our guide was wonderful. Just one suggestion that we have to make is, when you were offered the walking stick, take it. If you go to Cancun, don't miss this adventure."

He gave just the right amount of information about the caves, the history of the caves and how pure the water is. He was attentive to the whole group. We had a small and fun group who went on this adventure together. We swam and waded thorough the cave system and it lasted for 90 odd minutes. The cave floor is uneven but the water boots are perfect and stop the slip. I certainly recommend the tour!!The only down side was the price of the photos (no option but to get professional ones). It is a shame this isn't included."

I was a little nervous at first because my daughter is only 5, but after showing her some pictures and reassuring her we would be ok I decided to book our family of 5. Upon arrival, we met our guide Alina. She was terrific, knowledgeable, funny and super helpful; my daughter took to her right away. We were showered and suited up quickly, and then led to the opening of the cave where we were met by an elder for a spirit blessing. I found this to be a wonderful preset to our total experience. Once in the cave, Alina took my daughters hand and had her lead the small group of 9 through the cave and rivers. We were all amazed with every inch of the cave. It was a magical experience that even my 5 year old enjoyed. We saw tiny creatures (mostly spiders), we licked some stalagmites, and we even put baby sand from the rivers all over our faces for a free facial. ( which by the way is a MUST DO !! Our skin was glowing) Once we emerged from the cave we were stripped to our suits and taken to enjoy a traditional Mayan buffet which was delicious. I found the experience enjoyable for all ages and it truly was a once in a lifetime experience."

We went during an unusual (at least according to my veteran cruise friends) rainy day, My mood was already a bit down from the lack of sunlight throughout all the stopovers. But It quickly turned around when we finally got to the base of all the tours. Our tour guide, Alfredo, was very passionate about the caves of the Yucatan Peninsula, and was happy to share with us what he sees daily. For free, they provided us with lockers for our stuff since we couldn't bring anything but the clothes we had on. They also provided us with required water shoes, life vests, and helmets with a light affixed to it. Wetsuits and walking sticks are optional; I'd recommend the wetsuits since the water underground is a bit cool, and the walking sticks are to help with the changing terrain.For about 1hr30mins to 2 hours, Alfredo took us down to a part of a cave. The experience was both educational (learning about the geography of the peninsula and the religious significance to the local Mayan population) and relaxing as the caves have no sound apart from the ones humans make.After the tour they fed us with their local cuisine, with assorted spicy condiments that are actually spicy. Tropical fruits And drinks from local plants round out the healthy dining experience. Picky eaters might not want to do this if the range of foods eaten is narrow.Photographs are taken by an employee of the company and can be bought after the tour. Cameras are not allowed in the cave tour, no matter if they're water proof or not."

It's an amazing place. It's considered by Natl. Geographic to be THE best eco-tour in all of the Yucatan. The tour guide, Rodolfo, was from France, so spoke to the Spanish-speaking and English speaking group with a charming accent. He was very knowledgeable about the cave's geological makeup, explaining the various chemical components of stalactite and stalagmite formation.This is not for anyone seeking a relaxing stroll. The water changes depth many times so that you may be standing in a few inches one minute, and two steps later you plunge into full swimming mode, treading in deep water. But, it's great fun. The food at this Mayan village is also quite good and is included in the cost of the tour."

We thought the day was going to be a bust but the rain actually enhanced our tour and made it an excellent day! We took a rather long boat and car ride to get to the Secret River but once we arrived and got geared up our guide, Alfredo, took us on a short scenic hike through the woods to the cave. They offer a wet suit to keep you warm. Take them up on the offer. Also be sure and get a walking stick from the guide because it comes in very handy. On the way he told us about the Mayans and gave us other fun facts. Once we got to the cave we began walking and got into the slightly cold water. The wet suit made this a very comfortable experience. Without it I would have been a bit chilly. You will walk and swim through crystal clear water while looking at amazing rock formations and learning about the geology and history of the caves. The tour is long do you get your money's worth. After the tour they provide authentic Mexican style lunch. There is not any American food so if you are a picky eater you might be disappointed but the food was good though.The only negative I give them is that they do not allow cameras in the cave. They say this is for safety reasons and it does kind of make sense because there were areas where we slipped. They have their own photographer though and will sell you photos. The photos are really expensive though. $25 each or $79 for a CD with all of them. One final note: As with all yours in the islands you are expected to tip your guide."

I assumed I would have to accept the loss, but rec'd a call from Rio Secreto asking me what day I'd like to re-schedule for. Amazing customer Service.I took the tour on Thursday, Oct 29 and was blown away by this location. My tour group was only 3 people and out guide Julian was fantastic. He has a passion for this location and it showed. He was extremely knowledgeable and took great care of us.This is more than just a guided tour. It is completely interactive and requires quite a bit of physical activity. We hiked thru caved, swam in the underground river biked from one cave to another and repelled into the cave. There was a tasty lunch thrown in the middle to replace all the burned calories.Do yourself a favor and take this tour. It's beautiful beyond belief and you'll see things you may never see again. One quick tip, book it online at the Rio Secreto website and you save $20 (American)."

We have been in underground caverns before, but this is totally something else! We carefully chose how to use our time, and I couldn't be happier that we did this one. The excursion involved getting us onto a ferry boat that took us to Playa Del Carmen (the ferry ride was really nice, and the people working on it were so accommodating!). It took us about 35 minutes to get there and then a 30 minute (bumpy, but fun) ride into the jungle. Everyone from \"Rio Secreto\" from the start to finish were very informative, nice and polite. Very good service and information. We were never left wondering \"what now?\" When we arrived, they supplied everything you would need (wet suit, water shoes, etc.). We met our tour guide, Nunes, who was awesome! He had a way of speaking about the caves and the Mayan culture that made you really feel informed and respectful of the land you were exploring. We went down into the cave. Our group, a small 6 people, decided to use the \"hand hold\" method to get through. The other choice were walking sticks. I can see how that might be helpful for a large group. The hand-hold method made us all have a very unified and teamwork feel to the excursion---which I loved! We were required to help the person behind us, letting them know about dips in the rocks, ledges, etc. The absolute best parts were teh ones where you would lunge into the water, and swim your way through. Totally cool and unique. Nunes, our guide, was patient, and helped us all through the tricky parts. The water was a bit higher for our excursion because of recent weather. This made some parts of the excursion thrilling to say the least (we had to swim under some rocks---ahhh!!!!!). I left feeling like I had conquered something special, and connected with those around me---and with nature. I always felt safe and taken care of as well. After the tour through the caves we had a small buffet of traditional Mexican food. It was simplistic and perfect after what we had just went through. We were all able to sit at the table and talk about what we had just experienced. After the buffet, we were able to purchase pictures if you'd like (no cameras allowed---which is totally understandable considering its a nature preserve). Photo cost $25, but it was totally worth it, in my opinion. We also tipped our guide, which I think is definitely appropriate. You put your trust and safety into a good guide and I think that's worth some extra \"thanks\". I will never forget my experience at Rio Secreto and would recommend this excursion for anyone who likes adventure and exploration. Definitely NOT for people who aren't comfortable swimming, having claustrophobia, and/or the clumsy (the rocks can be sharp, and if not careful, you could hurt yourself)."

It was something she had read about and on her \"bucket list\". One of my phobias --and I have a few-- is closed in areas and especially underground! Yikes! Seriously thought of just lounging by the pool and skipping the visit. My family really encouraged me to go and with some meds on backup-- I went ! First of all, the ride in is quite long and very bumpy. I was getting carsick and thought this was such a mistake. When we arrived to our destination we were instructed to take showers- ugh- put on some wet suits, water shoes, life vest and helmets with a light. My heart was pounding so quickly I thought I was going to either have a heartache vomit or both! We had a Mayan blessing and I thought I'd be going to another life. When we got to the entrance of the cave, my daughter, husband and son in law saw my face and thought-- there's no way!! If you are claustrophobic I'm sure you can pick up my anxiety level. Our guide Diego was instrumental in getting me through this journey. He was like a sage that talked me off the ledge and it turned out to be an amazing experience. Not only in the beauty of the natural surroundings but facing and conquering one of my major fears! Can't believe I did it and it was magical! Thank you Diego! Some room for improvements--- buffet-- please no! Eat a good breakfast and skip the buffet! Hard sale for the photos and you can not take in cameras. Overall such a great experience!"

Ours -- Alex -- was amazing. Take the walking stick they offer -- its for feeling your way in the submerged parts of the cave. When we were there water level was high and the walking stick was essential. You go in small groups of 10. The formations are pristine -- there is very little \"breakage\" of the cave formations from thoughtless people, perhaps because this cave/cenote has not been open to public for long and access is in small groups. Great rainy day activity (you are underground!) A must see!! Its unfortunate photos are so expensive, but once you get down there you understand why you cannot bring your own camera or anything else for that matter. Leave all your jewelry in safe at hotel. Lockers are provided for your clothes, etc. Wear a swimsuit and water shoes (water shoes are provided if you wear flip flops).

The tour was incredible and definitely a unique and amazing experience. The caves were stunning and we felt like we were in an Indiana Jones movie while exploring them. Although the caves are dark, the lights that the tour guides have, along with your head lamps really provide a good bit of light. We were a little scared about swimming in the water before the trip, but once we were there and saw how clear it was, we dove right in. It was also surprisingly not very cold. It warns you that this is not for ppl who have claustrophobia, so that also made me nervous, as I have a little bit of that, but the spaces were large and did not make me feel uncomfortable at all! The footing can be a little difficult, even though you have a walking stick because you cant hold on the the sides of the rocks to stabilize yourself, but our guide- Alaina was really good about helping ppl when they needed it. She was also very knowledgeable, fun and interesting! She definitely helped to make the experience a great one. They provided you with all the equipment you need for the adventure. As many others mentioned, there is a photographer that follows you around to take photos. These were very expensive to purchase at the end of the tour- $79.99 for the whole disc, but you can bargain with the guys selling the photos and usually get them down a good bit. We and the others on our tour got them down to $50 for the whole disc. Still a lot, but the photos are incredible and definitely worth having.

I'm not claustrophobic but had never done anything like this before so had my doubts about doing it. This tour was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel, it was pouring with rain and they said this was a really good \"indoor\" activity to do. It cost about $100 each which I thought was reasonable as all the wetsuits, wet shoes, helmets and lunch were included. When we got there we were taken to the cenote on a dirt track full of flooded pot holes deep into the jungle. This ride took about 20 minutes and I have to say I was pretty scared!Once we got there, there were changing facilities and lockers, we were given the gear and got changed. By then I realised I had to get on with it and by the time we got into the cenote although I was nervous I started to get into it.We were in a group of 10 and we had a tour guide as well as a photographer following us. Our tour guide rocked! He was so friendly and knowledgeable I felt instantly at ease. Going into the cenotes was an incredible experience and I loved every minute of it. The water was pretty cold, there were some dry bits some wet bits, some shallow bits some deep bits. All of it was fun. We were shown how to walk to avoid falling over or scratching ourselves or stepping on a sharp rock. The entire experience was very relaxing with beautiful views inside the cenote. Our guide also explained how they were found, why they were there and how the formations happen. The entire tour took about 1.5-2 hours.Afterwards we were given a mezcal reception as well as lunch and a chance to view the photos. The photos were still on the pricey side but reasonable compared to other attractions we had done in the area.This cenote is just outside Playa del Carmen and I'd highly recommend to anyone staying in this area."

Fantastic and unusual stalactite and stalagmite formations, many variations of other natural sculpting formed over many centuries, and interesting to get to. Park right off the highway at the National Park entrance, pay your admission and ride about 5km across a dirt road to the welcome center and cavern entrance. A nice, locally typical indigenous meal is included in your admission, and after 3 hours or so, it will be greatly appreciated! Very knowledgeable guides, albeit a bit preachy about this natural treasure and ecology in general. A unique and meaningful experience."

It costs approx me $98 usd (we booked from our hotel) and we picked up in the morning. Commute to the preserve took approx 30min from our hotel (off 5th ave) playa de carmen and after intro and getting geared up we hit the trek into the underwood (mayan belief). The tour group was small (8-10 per group) and our guide Lara was terrific. The experience is very safe, all the equipment you'll need to enjoy the experience is provided and a visual treat. They don't allow any camera's (iphone, gopro) except if you have an underwater camera as they want you to purchase their own photos as a cameraman is on route every step of the way. Pictures are expensive ($35 for 2 or $79 for entire CD) which has over 30 pics of the whole journey. Amazing experience to swim in pitch dark caves and see the stalactites. Very safe even for weak swimmers. Would def recommend a must do if in Playa de carmen."

My friend and I were fortunate enough to join a group of Canadians (God bless you, Canada, and your ridiculously polite and charming citizens). The caves are amazing, and the knowledge and presentation of information from the tour guide (Raul, I believe) was top notch. We had one woman in the group who was claustrophobic. The guide alleviated her fears at the beginning and then had her follow right behind him the whole time (you go through the caves single file). He checked on her frequently and gently joked with her throughout the trip.The caves are stunning, and the tour is a combination of traversing rocks and swimming. By all means, take a walking stick. I had read reviews recommending it, and so I grabbed one right away and then everyone else did too. Not one person was sorry they did.After the tour, they give you a lovely meal and a little time to hang out in hammocks while you wait for your van to bring you back to your hotel.Can't recommend this tour enough."

I was originally looking for an open cenote that I could jump into and snorkel a bit but this was much more interesting. We had a small group (three couples) and an amazing guide, Miguel. He was funny and very knowledgable. He answered all of our questions even before we had to ask ;) One moment he turned off the light and we floated in the water for a minute of mediation. It was a surreal and refreshing experience. The trek through felt much faster than it was. I believe we were down there for 1.5 hours. Afterwards we are lead to a 'gift-shop' where they offer you to buy photos of your adventure. Very neat as the photographer followed you throughout the trip so you could click through it when you got out. But, like most touristy things in Mexico, the price of the photos were too much for us so we decided to just stick with our amazing memories! The lunch was great! Make sure you try the horchata with your meal, delicious... Would recommend to anyone who is willing!"

My husband and I are not typically the type to follow the herds of people behind a man holding a lollipop sign, but we decided on this excursion based on advise from a coworker who went a few years ago that we would give it a try. This shore excursion is well organized and worth every dollar. All equipment ie. Wet suits, water shoes, helmets with lights and towels provided. Lockers also provided at no additional cost. They take your pictures throughout the cave adventure. You are provided a lunch at the conclusion. You stay with your guide throughout the day which kept everything very well organized. Groups are 8 people, also excellent. We found this to also be a calm and relaxing experience. When we went it had rained through the day so water levels were higher in the caves. Our guide gave us different options, easy or more challenging referring to the degree of restricted space we had to use to exit the caves. We all agreed to up it to a level 3. So for those with some claustrophobic issues, stick to the basic level 0 or 1 because we barely made it through with our noses above water and our knees at our chest. Your knees and elbows might get bumped and scratched but it's only minor. The peace and beauty you'll discover underground is absolutely stunning. Like nothing we have ever experienced. Regardless of the weather outside, this excursion will not be affected. Just know, there's a 35min ferry ride to get to the location, at least there was for us coming from a cruise ship. So if you suffer from motion sickness or if the weather is inclement have some gravol on hand .... You'll be happy you did."

Carlos was an amazing guide who was very caring and concerned for those who were less agile and/or could not swim and provided really good explanations to the formations inside the caves. The place provides shoes, wet suit, life vest and helmet for you, so just wear your bathing suit underneath and you are all set to go. They don't allow cameras, because there is a photographer accompanying the group and you will have to pay to purchase the pictures at the end. We knew about this before we went and hence were mentally prepared to pay for overpriced pictures. So we set our minds to just buy one for memory sake. Just think about it this way. You are paying for them to continue running tours in a sustainable manner instead of having huge organisations coming in to tear down the place. My husband and I had a lot of fun and will recommend that you book a trip there too!"

He took the time to explain everything in both Spanish for the others in our group and English. He was very knowledgeable about every aspect of this magical place and made sure each of us came away with an incredible experience. Rio Secreto is one of those places that you will never forget. It is a full experience that touches your mind, body and soul. You will see things that you can't even begin to describe to those that haven't been. It is one of those things that should be on everyone's bucket list. Truly amazing!!"

It was absolutely one of the most beautiful places I've seen. The journey can be a bit challenging. As it is dark and the pavement uneven. Best to use one of the suggested walking sticks. They supply you with a wet suit and shoes if need be. My suggestion is to wear your own water shoes. Our guide - Alex, was the best! Very knowledgable, helpful and passionate about the environment. What we appreciated most was his genuine laugh when things were just simply funny. He encouraged the group to work together as a team and did an outstanding job telling us the history of the caves. Lastly, Alex is trilingual. He spoke French to my son, English to me and Spanish to a few others, without ever demonstrating signs of exhaustion. The lunch buffet was wonderful. I am not one who enjoys buffets, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food. This is a \"must stop\" while in Cancun."

Our nimble photographer was also very helpful in this capacity and helped out whenever she could.All in all, a great half day trip out - & would definitely do it again.The only downside to this trip was the ridiculous price that they wanted for the photos - $79 (\u00a350!!!) for 25 digital photos is totally unreasonable. $20 is closer to the mark if they want to sell more of those! Due to this, we did not buy them & so have NO photographic memories of this trip as they would not let us take our own cameras.It's a shame that greed spoilt this otherwise very good trip for us.Unless there is a 'legal' reason not to take your camera - take your own."

Andres was super informative he made sure that we all stayed together and knew where all the obstacles were in the water. Rio Secreto is definitely worth seeing as it's not something that you can experience all the time. I do recommend that you leave any of your jewellery at your hotel before you go as they want you to take off ALL your jewellery and leave it in lockers. We were on our honeymoon and didn't know this and I refused to take off my wedding ring so that is frowned upon. They didn't make me take it off which I'm grateful for but I would have left it in the hotel had I known that. Also you can't take your camera into the cave with you so if you want any pictures of your experience you have to purchase them."

It has only been open to the public since 2008 after being discovered in 2006. There are apparently three caves - make note if you are claustrophobic as the cave we went in got quite tight and we had to squeeze through, under water which was a little stressful. The tour guides are SUPER nice and helpful. The lunch after was really good. I didn't like that we couldn't bring cameras in as we purchased two photos (for $30) but I really would have liked to have been able to take my own pictures (would need a water-proof camera - maybe they can sell them). Note that this is a live cave and there are bats flying around. The scenery is just stunning, however, and the tour is very fun. Would highly recommend."

They will provide you with everything you need: from helmet and wetsuit to the water shoes and lunch afterwards. It is an incredible experience that is well worthy, so if you are visiting the Riviera Maya an excellent and amazing natural adventure. You may find underground rivers at other places (not sure if natural) but the experience at R\u00edo Secreto is unique, you won't be disappointed."

I have to say I am extremely happy we decided to visit this rather than Ek Balam for the simple reason of it being too hot outside. To be honest i would never visit something like this but i read cool water in a cave and we were there.. The guide Alex S. was incredible he spoke fluent English and French. The group i was with wasnt exactly the fittest Alex ensure every member was safe and make it through this amazing wonder. His delivery and knowledge matches that of a young scholar. The features of the cave were simply amazing. The only downside is the pricy photo option $80 us. I suggest offering a lower price to have the files emailed to guest. This way you will have no cost in burning a cd and you will access people email maybe use as another source of income sharing events and fund drives. Overall it was incredible."

Benito was our guide into the cavernous underground river and it was an awesome experience. They provided everything you needed from the helmet and wetsuit to the water shoes and lunch afterwards. Our guide was so fascinating; he knew everything about the river and made it so interesting. The beauty is beyond compare and the actual trek was amazing. We do caves everywhere we travel but we have never been down in the river and walked amoung the stone formations. My husband does not swim but Benito made sure his \"limousine\" float was safe and pleasant. It is a must go...especially if a hot day trip to the pyramids is too much for you!"

He let our 7 year old son help with any of the explanation stops & help with the flashlight and also allowed him the be right on his heels when moving through the cavern. Tako did this, and the entire presentation with a smile on his face. He was extremely knowledgeable and very passionate. I helped our 5 year old over some of the more difficult parts, but with adult helping, any 5 year old would make it through the tour just fine.The beauty & wonder of Rio Secreto cannot be overstated. You MUST make this a stop while you're in Cancun. Honestly, we enjoyed this much more as a family than Tulum. We will certainly come back again & recommend Rio Secreto to anyone headed to Cancun."

I've seen quite a few caves in my life, but this one is really amazing, because of wonderful stalactites and stalagmites but also because the way this tour is organized, I'd say perfect. They provide you with wetsuit, life vest, special shoes and hardhat with headlamp, because you have to walk 700 meters along the cave, in water (sometimes the water comes under your chin while the stalactites touch with your helmet). A guide who speaks perfect English and a photographer accompanied us (because we were not allowed with our own cameras!). In the end they sell you (for only 99 USD!!!) a CD with about 30 pictures (showing you and your group in the underground) and about 20 pictures which you can find on the internet, also. In my opinion, there should have been more pictures with the wonders of the caves. After the tour, the lunch (which was included): very poor, I don't recommend it. Any way, I still consider this adventure a must."

The entire operation is slick and very well done! Our guide Alondra was sensational. She has a mixture of Spanish and English speaking guests and she conversed in both languages the whole time. She was knowledgeable and friendly. Aside from that, the caves themselves are just gorgeous. It was really cool heading into the underground and it was quite overwhelming to the point I felt a little emotional and blessed to be amongst this amazing piece of nature. It was a nice surprise at the end of the tour to receive a lovely lunch which was really really nice and it also included drinks too.A piece of advice, once you arrive to check-in, you then are taken down a dirt road 7km into the jungle to where the cave starts. The road is bumpy and windy so if you get car sick, jump in the front to save you from feeling sick.Also just pay for the entrance as you will save yourself almost $30USD if you make your own way there. Its only 10minutes from Playa del Carmen and you can catch a local bus from the ADO terminal on 5th ave (the main street in town), direct to the entrance of Rio Secreto for 15pesos (approx $1USD).The other thing is photography is not allowed within the cave, so if you want photos budget for the photos that they take whilst in the caves. The are expensive but they are great HD quality. A really enjoyable day and a MUST-DO!!!"

We got to spend a long time exploring the cavern. It will do a lot of walking and moving up and down rocks as you go through the cave. The water was cold, but not unbearable. They provided scuba suits in case you can't handle the water temperature. Our favorite part was when we were in deep water and we all held hands and turned out our lights. it was so dark that it didn't matter whether your eyes were closed or not. Unknowingly, we paid for the \"plus\" experience and got to see repel down to an additional cave and see a light show in another cave. We probably wouldn't recommend the \"Plus\" part of the experience."

We were outfitted in wet suits, water shoes (or you can bring your own), a life jacket and a hard hat with headlamp. Secure lockers were provided for our personal belongings. After a short walk down a path through the jungle we entered the underground river. You'll walk over and around various rock formations in different levels of water. Walking sticks were optional for anyone with balance issues. Most of it is walking through water but there were a few times when the water is over the head and some paddling was required. Being able to swim was not mandatory. It is challenging enough that some senior citizens might have a problem with this excursion. The natural formations with stalactites and stalagmites was very interesting and beautiful. Our tour guide, Yayo.was very knowledgeable and shared a lot of history and information. A photographer came along on our tour and took a lot of pictures. The excursion included a delicious buffet lunch of rice, beans, eggs, tortillas, awesome salsa, drink. The photos offered on a CD are rather pricey but because there were so many of us we justified purchasing the CD for $79. They don't pressure you to purchase them.

We had an hour bus ride to the site. The actual bus was super nice. Rio Secreto was amazing and something we have never seen before. The company was very careful to keep it as untouched as possible (shower ahead of time, not touching the cave, etc). Our guide was Andres and he was wonderful. He taught us a lot about the history, caves, stalagmites, etc. The photographer also did a nice job. It was helpful to not have to worry about taking pictures throughout our exploration so that we could enjoy the experience more. We were gone from around 8:30-4:00 or so. Bring your own water shoes if you have them. They will provide them used if you would like, but some are not in the best shape. This is not an activity for an elderly person, someone who is not quick on their feet or someone that is claustrophobic. The terrain is a little tough at times (swim, walk, duck, crawl, step up and down, etc). The staff was phenomenal and I can't say enough positive things about our experience. It will be a fabulous memory that we will always have!! Even after our visit, I decided I wanted more photos than I ordered and they communicated with me and fulfilled my request. HAPPY CUSTOMERS!"

Once we donned our wet suits and safety gear, we were ready to begin our journey through this beautiful underground river. Before entering the cave you take part in a traditional Mayan ceremony-which is basically a blessing for your safe entrance and return out of the caves. Our guide, Andres was awesome!!! Our group consisted of only the four of us, so he spent extra time pointing out all the different types of stalactites and stalagmites along the way. He was very knowledgeable and you could tell he really loved and valued his job. The caves are truly spectacular and so peaceful. Turning off our lights for those few minutes was a magical and enlightening experience. Since our hotel was pretty close to this tour, our price was $99 USD. Lunch is included and is delicious. Beer was available for purchase but not included. As I said earlier, this was an amazing experience and I highly recommend it!! So, next time you are in Playa Del Carmen, make time to visit this truly remarkable place. Oh and ask for Andres for your guide!!"

A bonus, aside from all of the cave sights, the water is cold--as in you wear a wetsuit, but it feels so glorious after being in the hot Mexican sun. I recommended this to several of our other friends who had gotten there after us but leaving later than us---it was a definite must do! Everyone should venture to this newly discovered cave and experience some natural beauty. One thing they did not say is at the last part of the cave tour, before you start making your way back up the stairs, it gets pretty tight---the cave is just inches above your head while the water is at your shoulders and you only have a few inches of room on each side also. I had to tell myself just to keep walking and breath to make it through....in the end though I'm still glad I got to have this experience!"

We were given a complimentary shot of Rio Secreto liqueur and as this was an all inclusive trip, lunch was then available. It was wonderful, tasty food - thank you.I purchased the photo package with Photo CD, book and bottle of liqueur. Quite expensive at $119 USD but I wanted to never forget this trip. Rio Secreto was the most fabulous experience and I would highly recommend it."

Great for couples, singles or a family it truly shouldn't be missed. We started with a walk through the dense jungle (on a track of course) and then approach a Mayan spiritual chief who blesses us before we descend into the Mayan underworld as they say. The cave we enter is simply breathtaking and the waters a cool yet a refreshing change from the stifling Mexican heat. Our guide Alex was a champ! He knew so much and was so passionate about these sacred lands which really added to the experience. Lastly the food at the end was typical Mexican (no not Taco Bell), delicious! Highly recommend for anyone wanting an expertly run tour and for those wanting a bit of adventure."

But, you must keep in mind that you may not get to see what you expect like in photos, because of the reason that it is dark and all you have is your helmet light, which doesnt give much light either! However i must say, our tour guide julian was the best!! Be sure to go with julian, he'll definitely make it a fun ride !! What was most disappointing was that the photographer was a bit annoy !! You cant take pictures of the cave itself, only he can!! If we would have known that before i dont know if we would have gone! In addition, the photo he sells are extremely expensive and not worth it"

It really is a unique experience to wade and swim through the caves with nothing but your headgear lamp to light the way. And big props to Carlos, who I know is reading his own press. What a guy! He is knowledgeable, entertaining, and really knows his way around the cave system. We can\u2019t say enough good things about Rio Secreto or Carlos. He\u2019ll learn your name before the excursion into the caves even begins, and he knows who you are throughout. He took great care to ensure everyone was able to navigate around the various roots, rocks, steep inclines, etc.After quite some time in the \u201crefreshing\u201d water of the caves, there is a nice buffet lunch awaiting, along with a hammock area, and a photo center where you can choose to purchase individual shots or a CD of all the photos. I have no doubt that all of the guides at Rio Secreto are capable and competent, but when we return to see some different areas of the caves, we\u2019ll request Carlos to show us around this magical sanctuary once again.

            "review": "Great Experience, Would Do it Again. We arrived by tourist bus, which was pulled over by the federal police across the road from the entrance. The attraction sent a new bus to get us while the drive dealt with the police. There is an introduction video explaining the tour. You are then packed into another van, and driven to the site, which is about 20 minutes down some extremely bumpy roads. Then you are outfitted with a lifejacket, a helmet, a head lamp, and an optional wet suit. If you don't bring water shoes they will sell them to you. They are an absolute must. The cave network has a few entrances and exits, so I guess the tour guides have the discretion to decide where you will go in, and where you will come out. An affiliated photographer goes with you, no photos or videos allowed otherwise. It is 1.5 to 2 hours in the caves, which are remarkable. A few pauses for photos, and one planned \"romantic\" opportunity that might be uncomfortable if you are not travelling with family or romantic partners. No opportunity to explore on your own except the 30 seconds they are taking photos of other couples. You are on your feet wading most of the time, swimming a small portion. You will stub your toes on something. The grip on the floor even under the water is just fine. The problem is not being able to see all the stalegmites and other coral formations under the water that you are about to step on or off of. Take their warnings seriously.When the tour is done, back to unkit, a celebratory shot of their branded liquor, then into the photo booth to order photos at $25 a shot. The lunch buffet is not fantastic, but you don't leave hungry.Our guide's name was Carlos. He was knowledgeable, and thoughtful about the needs of the different guests in navigating the terrain."

We were met after the admissions booth by a Rio Secreto rep and went through the paperwork and signed our waivers...gulp lol. Then we boarded a mini bus which took us on a 20 mins bumpy drive into the jungle to where the experience really begins.We were introduced to our guide, a lovely enthusiastic italian guy called Danielle who's energy was infectious!! We showered and fitted with wetsuits, reef shoes, life vest and helmet. Then the adventure began.You start with a 10 minute walk to meet the local shamen who gives a quick blessing, to allow you to safely enter the caves without angering the gods (who knows but an enjoyable thing to witness) then onto the cave.You enter via some very steep steps, and into the cave you go. The route we took started with some walking and paddling, the water being very refreshing and you'll be thankful of the wetsuit, and eventually became deeper to the point of being chest deep in some places, which is great fun. All the while you are surrounded by the amazing caves, stalagtites and stalagmites, creatures and catfish in the water, amazing. Danielle was superb in his explanation of the cave system and its formation and was very passionate about its conservation. At one point he got us to lie down in the water while he said a blessing, and then switched off all the lights which was peaceful and a strange but great experience. The photographer fired her flash which lit up the stalagtites and the image remained in the retina....beautiful.After the cave walk has finished, you are invited to the photograph rooms and shown the pictures which you can purchase. At $80 they are expensive, but part of the money goes towards the conservation of the caves, so ultimately they are worth purchasing.Food comes next...not the best meal you'll eat but great after a few hours of adventure.All in all a great experience, which was enjoyed by all my family and well worth the money."

Rio Secreto - The Underground River It is a link of natural grottos with high in minerals fresh water and beautiful formations of stalactites, stalactites, columns and gnats. On arrival a wristband will be given by the driver and a briefing with a waver form will be given. Groups of about 10 will be formed (according to the language spoken) before boarding a mini bus which takes tourists 7km into the jungle to the cave area.There a tour guide will meet each group. After a funky communal shower wetsuits, water shoes, life vests and helmets will be given. Also, walking stick will be provided (and I strongly recommend that you take it, as it proved to be very useful).After about 5min walk through the jungle and a traditional Mayan blessing, caves can be entered and one of three routes will be taken. The caves are about 26 meters under the sea level, 30 km long and pitch dark. Wading through the water, claiming up, descending through rough terrain, swimming over might not be for everyone but the absolute unity with nature takes everyones breath away.The underground tour takes about 1hr 30min and is followed by a hearty meal and purchase of the official photographs, as individual cameras are NOT PERMITTED.The whole experience lasts about 3hrs.Be prepared for team work, hard work, amazement, joy and beauty."

We had never heard of this attraction, but we have been to Xel-ha twice before and wanted to do something different. The tour operator at our hotel recommended it, and what sold us on it was a wonderful photographer we met at one of our dinners. He said it was the best thing he had done in his own country.We were picked up right from our hotel by a very professional driver. A short drive later, and you spend about 15 minutes filling out forms and being assigned a guide. Back into vans for a the drive to the river. At this point you are given a wet suit, helmet and life vest. You also must wear water shoes, bring your own if you have them. Diana was our guide and she was amazing. She walked us through the jungle for about 5 minutes to the entrance to the river. Before we descended, she said, 'Now you'll see why I love my job so much'. Instantly you're in the cave, entering the cool water and surrounded by miraculous sights. It's dark of course, but never gives you a scary or creepy feeling. Everyone has lights on their helmet, and the guide has a flashlight as well. Diana was giving the tour in Spanish and English, and passed along amazing information. It was a remarkable tour, natural, fantastic, beautiful. I would do it again if I could. The walk/wade/swim takes about 90 minutes. Everything is interesting. So much to see. Our group was in awe the whole time. Swimming close to the stalactites was great. A photographer is along of course, and you pose for a number of photos that you have the chance to buy later. There is an expensive $120 package, all photos on a disc for $70, or one photo for $25 - that's all we needed.Lunch is tortillas and stews, with juice. Good but not great. But you don't do this tour for the food! Highly recommended!"

Once you arrive, get tickets you are asked to sit and watch a video then you are divided into groups based on your primary language.

Once there you will get your locker, put on your shoes, shower, put on wet suite, helmet and vest. next you walk 5 min into the jungle and are blessed by a Mayan priest. Once you enter the caves you will be in there for 1.5 hours but the time flies. You see all sorts of amazing rock formations, a few small creatures (not scary) and get to swim in crystal clear fresh water. Exit up and out, another 5 min walk through jungle. Get the photo package ($80 USD but worth it) You are served a buffet of local food and then back on the van to the entrance. Plan on 3 hours at minimum for this tour.Note: when walking through the caves you are not allowed to touch the walls or rocks. The floor is very uneven so be mindful of this. If you have balance issues take the walking stick when it is offered. Note: We are glad we did not take the grandparents (in their late 70's) as the terrain would have been too difficult. Kids thought this was the best trip ever! I have to agree."

            "review": "Power Up with Gonzo. Last month my wife and two children ages 13 and 14 did the underground river tour. Our guide was Gonzo, no not the one from the muppets. Gonzo the \"great\" was in fact wonderful!!! First, he is extremely knowledgable about everything in the area, especially the underground caverns and rivers known as Cenotes. We all had a great time. This is a unique and fun excursion for the entire family. The only people I would not recommend this would be for the elderly or anyone who has issues with their footing as once and a while walking on the rocks in the water can be taxing and test your balance. Otherwise the the caves are beautiful and the water is crystal clear. Gonzo knows everything one could possible know about all the stalactites etc. and all the other things and creatures that you will find in the caves. He is very passionate about his work and fun to be with. He is just the kind of guide that you want to be with on this type of excursion. He will also fill your head with all kinds of interesting information regarding the Cenotes in Mexico. I highly recommend Rio Secreto to anyone looking for a really different and fun excursion. Also, after the tour there is a pretty good meal that awaits you but stay away from the really hot sauce unless that is your cup of tea. Also, be careful as at the end of your tour Gonzo will be looking to push shots of green anisette and honey on you. It is great stuff for the adults but be careful or he may drink you under the table. Also, buy the disk with all the pictures that are taken, it is a better value over buying individual pictures. Overall this excursion is a lot of fun, extremely unique and something you and your children will not soon forget. Thank you again Gonzo for a great time and \"power up\" dude, also sorry the review is a little late but better late than never."

Learning about the mayan history. And, of course, the *amazing* underground river. The dry cave is a little odd - there is a laser light show about evolution and the history of language... why? But that was the only thing that was kind of strange amidst all the natural beauty. We LOVED this. Definitely go! It is great they are serious about preserving the nature so you must shower every time you go underground and NO TOUCHING the stalagtites as it damages them. Photos are a little $$ but.. happy to contribute to conserving this amazing piece of history and nature."

Everything looked in new or great condition. After a overview, and blessing from a Chaman, we were lead by Alina who was so good with helping us with every step of the way. The time with her was awesome. Her knowledge and enthusiasam is the best. The water in the cave was cool and safe. We had a great lunch, and also brought back pictures taken inside the cave.

He guilded me through and I am very grateful toward him, so guys, if you are non-swimmers like me, don't be discourage , the tour guild will help you.

To begin with we watched a video explaining the background to the caves and their discovery. We then travelled in a van for quite some time until reaching the caves. Once there, we put on our wetsuits and booties and left everything else in lockers. Walking to the caves we were blessed by a local and given permission to enter. We were on a private tour so the caves were quiet and peaceful and so beautifully lit. Some of the time we were dry, whilst other times we walked or swam through the crystal clear water. At no time did it feel claustrophobic. It was a stunning experience, like nothing else we have done before. We had a photographer travelling with us the whole time. Personal cameras are not allowed in the caves so it is definitely worth buying the photo package, you definitely want a reminder of this magical experience. Everyone in our family, from the 11 year old to the parents absolutely loved this. Make sure you include this activity in your holiday itinerary."

Our tour guide really loves what he does and he taught us so much about anything & everything he could. After the tour we even had a nice buffet lunch that was included. Tips for the tour: I highly suggest that everyone gets a walking stick for the cenote (they offer them to you before starting the tour). I didn't get one thinking it would be annoying to hold and swim with, but I regretted it after. It is not a flat surface so it makes it a little difficult to walk. The stick really helps you keep your balance. They also offer you a wetsuit and water shoes for the tour. Take the wetsuit because the water is a bit cold."

            "review": "We loved this experience!. First of all, you can read a whole lot of reviews here about the non-cave details of this tour. The long, bumpy ride there, the time spent preparing (we did not watch a video), the time spent eating pretty good but simple food, the time spent with the entrance ceremony or the Mayan champagne at the end. But the real reason to come here is to see this cave - an amazing natural wonder unlike anything I've ever seen. So if I had to put up with all the surrounding events to get there, it was worth it to see this amazing place. Our guide, Carlos, was knowledgeable, laid-back but very professional and funny. He made the tour so informative and interesting, and was great with the 3 kids (ages 7-10) on this tour. I just couldn't believe the beauty of this place. Carlos said there are many different tour routes, so keep in mind that what you read about in these reviews may not apply to your tour. For instance, we didn't rappel or crawl through tight spaces. And we did swim. A lot. Many places were over our heads and we were allowed to actually dive into the pools headfirst. The water was so clear and turquoise and the formations were so beautiful. Very otherworldly. We have toured several other cave systems including Mammoth Cave (many times) and I just kept thinking - the NPS would never let us do this! It was rough terrain under the water and easy to slip. No handrails or smooth trails.Our kids loved it, as did we.The reason I give this tour 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the photo pitch. My husband said, \"this was like a bunch of posed picture-taking with a tour in the middle.\" Which is almost accurate. They made us pose for various pictures during the tour which got really tiresome after a while. I didn't mind so much because it was just so beautiful to stand in there, no matter what! My favorite part of the tour was when we stopped under a huge formation of stalactites. Carlos had our family groups hold hands in circles in the total darkness and reminded us that families are the most important thing. It really was a special moment even though that might sound cheesy... And then the photographer took pictures under the formation and the flash made it look just like fireworks! A really cool effect. Anyway, if you're interested in beautiful wonders, go see it."

            "review": "FABULOUS!. This was one of the most spectacular tours we've ever done! Great for hot days! Francis was our guide and he was fabulous and very knowledgeable. Let me first say I do not recommend this for little kids. It is almost impossible to carry a child through this cave. There is a rough hike to the cave and inside the cave (though there are different sections that the guide will pick for the tour) it is NOT recommended for non-swimmers or people who have difficulty walking, or are very out of shape. Luckily we are average size, don't have children, and know how to swim. This is not recommended for very tall or very short. individuals Meaning anyone over 6'2\" will find it difficult to bend over and get through the low ceiling caves---trust me! Also for short stature individuals less that 5' will have difficulty wading through the lower water areas. The water is high in many parts of the cave contrary to the advertising. My husband and I both had a little anxiety, but we pushed through it. Those who are claustrophobic may find this too much--you may want to reconsider as there are some really tight squeezes through crawl spaces in the cave--not by knees but having to bend over. I have major back problems and did okay. I can see where little kids will be scared to go in. Do not let the pictures fool you...it is PITCH black. The lighting that you see on the pictures comes from the photographer taking pictures. The only light you'll have is from your helmet. Francis made us feel very safe, and was so entertaining and friendly---he was GREAT! Also you are NOT allowed to take pictures and EVERYONE was very upset about this. You are pushed to buy their pictures--some where blurry and quite frankly who wants to purchase pictures of everyone in the tour? Many people in our tour just refused to buy pictures out of spite--we included. It's ridiculous! TIPS FOR THE OWNERS: Here is a GREAT idea, why not just charge people to bring a camera? This way people can take their own pictures and then feel more comfortable purchasing a picture. You would make FAR more money. We brought this up, and we were told that they used to allow for pictures, but people would spend so much time taking pictures and not watching where they were going (again this is VERY rugged terrain) and people would fall an have accidents. Solution? Just tell people there will be times when the guide stops to take pictures. On the tour the photographer will stop, and the guide, to take everyone's picture. You wait in line to have your photo taken. So, during this time, while people are waiting for pictures, just allow them to take pictures on their own, or use their GO PROs! Problem solved! I guarantee people will without a doubt purchase a picture as well. If not, you still receive your money for the camera charged to people bring their own cameras--a win-win for EVERYONE! OR just charge a little extra for the tour and guarantee everyone one picture of themselves or their family---problem solved again. This way people don't feel like they are being cheated---the contrary, they will actually feel like they are getting a deal! I spend several years in marketing for a successful firm, so I KNOW what I'm talking about. Try it--you will see a much happier group, and you will generate even MORE money! Offer two packages: one a bit more expensive with guaranteed photo of yourself. Second: BOY camera with additional charge, and still have the option of purchasing more pictures. Simple. I should charge you for this consultation :-) We charged our clients $120/hr for consulting! Aw, you're getting it for free! Doesn't that make you feel like your getting a deal? Now, let your guests feel like they are receiving one too! :-) Also, I advise bringing your own water shoes or rock/water shoes. The give you some but they are pretty old and nasty. You can also purchase some if you'd like at their store.Oh, I forgot, someone mentioned the food was some burrito and beans lunch that wasn't filling. I have to say our lunch was GREAT! Soft drinks or water are an additional charge, but they have water and juice for free at the table--which is what we did. The food was some rice, chicken and sauce, pasta with cheese, tortillas, fresh guacamole, chips, and fruit. It was VERY tasty and we enjoyed the company of others. After all if your complaining about the food, the highlight of the trip is the cave--not the food. But again, I thought it was delicious so did the rest of our group--we were pleasantly surprised! :-)Overall great trip HIGHLY RECOMMEND--maybe you can request Francis--he's a gem! Happy journey and be safe!"

They really try to preserve the integrity of the caves which is nice. At one point we turned all out lights out and mediated in the DARK. All you can hear are water droplets which was peaceful and eye opening to see how dark and quiet the caves would be unoccupied. The water was so beautiful and so were the roots in the caves along with the coral and other structures that formed inside. We bought the pictures that the photographer took along the way.

Beautiful caves, crystal clear water, all sorts of geological features that you just don't see above ground. Also, this particular site has not been modified or commercialized. When you are down there, the only evidence of human presence is a string along the wall. Only one or two small things that indicate people have ever even been there. Most of the time, you are seeing it as it was when it was discovered. I understand there are other underground cave attractions in the area, but they have been modified to allow easier access for more visitors. Rio Secreto also offers and private tour lasting four or five hours, I think, for just a few people. We plan to do that on a future trip.Can't say enough good about this place. Might be difficult for someone who has unsure footing or a hard time getting around. Non-swimmers should be fine as long as they aren't scared of the water, and can otherwise get around ok. There are a couple spots that are kinda close quarters, but I didn't see that anyone in our group had any problems. Maybe not a good idea if you are extremely claustrophobic.Included lunch buffet was not bad."

It is impressive that he can just look at someone and know exactly the size and model of wetsuit that will fit to perfection!The lunch buffet was absolutely delicious as was the flavoured water offered during the meal.We went in a large group so it was just us on the tour and that made it even more special however I wouldn't hesitate to go back if there were less people that wanted to go!

The experience is jawdropping. This was my first underground cave tour and nothing will compare. Tour guides are very patient especially with kids. Water is refreshing...bit cool on a hot humid day but this is expecting since its all fresh water underground. Its safe to drink and in fact 20% of Mexicos reserve comes from Rio Secreto. After the tour, you get fed some good food. Soda, chips and beer are extra. Picture CD is only $60USD and if you want a USB its an extra $10USD. I thought it was fair since you have a photographer that comes along with the group. Roughly 133 pictures. Nice!!!!"

The tour was amazing and the guides very informative. In our group one person had never spent much time around water and was very apperhensive about floating (with life jacket) and our guide was amazing at calming and reassuring and did what I thought a very professional job to make sure everyone had a great experience. The Caves/Caverns were absolutly amazing formations as well it was refreashing nice tour on a hot day."

It was very made up and seemed completely rehearsed.. The guide, Alana was not enthusiastic or excited at all which was a major downer considering we paid $215 for the experience I may have enjoyed the beauty of the cave if I had a tour guide that seemed a little happier to be doing what she was doing. Also, it's absolutely ridiculous that they sop you for photo ops every 10 minutes in the cave, another way that they ruined what should have been a natural experience. No cameras are allowed, but $100 cash is allowed to pay for the photos they take! Lastly, they should mention that there are portions of deep water and plan out having an extra guide for those who cannot swim and are uncomfortable even with a life vest and there were quiet a few. Myself and a few others walked (unsafely) along the side of the cave with the camera man! To be honest, the guide seemed annoyed that we were taking a bit longer and wouldn't swim with everyone else.Overall, I would do it again because the cave is a memorable part of nature that I won't have the opportunity to see anywhere else, but definitely with a different guide. Cudo's to the camera man, Juan for helping us through the cave!"

            "review": "Well worth it. First this is a strenous excursion! If you are not able to walk on uneven dry ground you will NOT be able to do this. Getting to the cave is a 15 minute walk through the forest and then down a very steep narrow cut out steps. If you can do this then you still have to deal with very uneven paths through water. Our guide, Alina, was awesome! She had so much great info and never got exasperated when she had to wait for someone to catch up and she was so informative about the cavern system. The formations are still alive and gorgeous! I love the fact that the owners are keeping the tourists from touching the formations and limiting the number allowed in. The equipment is good quality and works just like you expect. The wetsuits are perfect for the 72 degree water in the cave. There is not a lot of swimming, more if you are on the short side like me, but most of the water is walkable. The food we had for lunch was a nice treat since we were only expecting a snack and drink. The photos are not too pricey but they are $79 for the whole package. The ladies at the photo shop do NOT like to take cash. They refused a $100 bill from us for our photos because one corner was curled, so we were not able to get any of our photos since we don't like to use a CC card in unfamiliar venues. My husband was able to use that same bill to buy 2 beers next door. Just one of the quirks in Mexico. We did this tour as an excusion from a Carnival cruise and we felt that we paid fairly for the great day we had."

            "review": "A must-see!. Rio Secreto was definitely one of the highlights of our recent trip to the Mayan Riviera. On arrival, we watched a video on the caves and ecosystem. We were then organized into groups of ten and were led to a changing area, where we changed into our swim wear and were given lockers to store any valuables. We were given towels, wetsuits, life vests, water shoes and a hard hat with a headlamp. We also opted for the option of taking a stick with us, which we found useful for helping us maintain our balance in the underground caves, especially as the caves are pitch black and the only light came from our headlamps.Once we were ready, our guide Epco led us along a path to an area where we received a special blessing from a Mayan shaman, and then we continued on to the caves. We were fortunate to have Epco as our guide ~ apart from having a wonderful sense of humour, he was also extremely knowledgeable about the ecosystem and history of the caves. We also had a great photographer follow us on our tour as we were not allowed to take any photos. After the tour, we bought the package, even though we found it somewhat pricey at US$69.The underground cave is absolutely amazing! Epco led us deep inside the cave, where we walked and swam through a route that showed us the most beautiful stalactites and stalagmites. We stopped along the way to take photos and learn more about the ecosystem from Epco. Even though there was a portion of the tour that required us to climb a little and swim, we never felt that it was unmanageable, and Epco was careful to ensure that our group was comfortable and safe during the tour. We were in the cave for just over an hour ~ and it was a wonderful experience!After the tour, we changed back into our clothes and had a drink and snack before selecting our photo package.If you decide to do only one tour, we would recommend Rio Secreto. From start to finish, it was interesting and fun, and we highly commend the professionalism of the guides and rest of the employees."

He really made us all feel safe in a cave and my 7 year old daughter had tons of fun in that water. I thought the dark wet cave would terrify her but had the opposite affect. Julian took us on a family adventure on a rainy day in playa del carmen. We were on our 2nd day of non-stop rain and husband and daughter were both getting depressed stuck in our hotel room. Rio Secreto saved us from yet another gloomy afternoon and offered a cool, safe and exciting activity which lasted about 3.5 hours from beginning to end. We got wetsuits, watershoes, life jackets and helmets with lights. After our cave excursion we got to change into dry clothes and got to enjoy a nice warm lunch. And let me not forget our SHOT for being so brave!!! The only reason i did not rate them 5 is because the ridiculous pricing of the pictures at the end. That part is a little bit frustrating as you spent good money to do this so there should not be this crazy offer of $80 to purchase a cd of pics that are not just of your family but of everyone in your group....or the more ridiculous offer of 1 pic for $25....but i did get that...after all i wanted at least one to remember the fun day."

It was a little disappointing that they made us share underwater flashlights. We are going again in December, with kids, and will be requesting additional flashlights.

I felt completely safe at all times and was so blown away by what i saw i forgot i was even frightened going in. If you are in mexico you need to do this , it is bucket list worthy dont miss out.

See it, touch it, learn from it and witness it first hand as Rudolpho, in his heavy French accent, explains to you exactly what you are seeing. It is a physical journey and not for the timid. There are multiple areas of uneven underground terrain but you are provided with safety gear and a competent guide to avoid an harm. If you want a Disney-like journey in an underground river got to Xcarrat. If you want the REAL THING....go to Rio Secreto! You will be amazed and what nature has provided."

We took our 10 year old daughter who loved it too. It's definitely a full day event so be prepared for a full day. We thought the jungle would be hot but much to our delight, it wasn't! Ask for Julio (father to a little 2 year old girl). He is extraordinary & has such passion for his work! Please bring a decent amount of money to tip the tour guides as that is how they earn their living. You'll also want money to tip the drivers to and from Rio Secreto."

Multiple tours were running at the same time, but they split us up into small groups (less than 10 each) so it felt like we had a private tour. Jorge, our guide was excellent. He explained the importance of showering before entering the caves to help preserve the fragile ecosystem. After suiting up, we took a short hike through the jungle (yes, there are mosquitoes, but it's a relatively quick hike). A local Mayan blessed us prior to entering the cave. Jorge ensured that we all felt comfortable throughout our journey. The kids in our group (as young as 7 years old) reveled in the experience just as much as the adults. We scooted, climbed, crouched, waded, and floated. Nothing too strenuous but one should be in good physical health and unafraid of floating neck deep in water through small spaces. Jorge pointed out large cavernous spiders, bats, and shrimp. My favorite part of the tour was when he had us turn off our headlamps and sit in meditative silence for a minute. Once our ears adjusted, we could hear drops of water traveling from the stalactites into the pools of water. It was awesome! To end our tour, we were provided with a delicious buffet of local food. Everything was tasty, especially the fresh made corn tortillas and cactus salad.I'd also like to point out how professional the staff is at Rio Secreto. Jorge was very informative and eager to share his \"office\" with us. You can really tell how passionate he is about his job. At the very end, you have the option to purchase photos. For the price of this tour, it would be nice to include 1 photo. However, a photographer accompanies each group and takes some really beautiful shots. I wanted to make sure I tipped our guide and shuttle drivers, so I didn't have enough cash to purchase photos. After I left, I emailed Rio Secreto. Ramon was very accommodating and gave me a great deal on photos which I happily purchased through PayPal. If you've snorkeled and ziplined in Cancun already, I highly recommend caving next!"

My mother is slightly claustrophobic, so we were a bit worried about her...but no need...she was a warrior!! We arrived for the last tour of the day...the 2pm tour. After a brief synopsis of the place, you are driven 7 km to the site by the caves. You are instructed to get in your bathing suits and then given wet shoes. It is up to you if you want to wear the wet suit (which is two pieces). You can opt out of it completely or wear one of the two pieces. All of us wore the entire suit...the bottom part is like shorts...not long pants. We then walked a bit on a trail and engaged in a purification ritual. Our fabulous (and I mean fabulous) guide Alina then took us to the cave entrance and told us what to expect inside the cave. My father (79 years) was a bit nervous...but Alina basically held his hand the whole way and he did very well and had a great time! My mom mostly navigated by herself and did so incredibly well!! The cave is amazing! There are dry spots and then there are areas where you are in the water. I loved the parts in the water...especially toward the end when you had to swim (or float) for a bit. The scenery with stalagtites and stalagmites was stunning and we had fun taking pictures at various intervals with our photographer Arturo. We even got to see a bat flying around...something I have always wanted to see but never have in the many other caves I have visited! The entire time in the cave is about 1.5 to 2 hours after which you change back into your dry clothing and head to the included buffet before driving back to the entrance. I purchased my tickets a few weeks in advance, so I got 25% off the regular price. It was an amazing experience for all of us and I'd go again in a heartbeat!!"

There was another English speaking couple and one Spanish speaking individual in our small group. We booked and paid in advance over the phone (which was somewhat slow), but check-in that morning was smooth. We were asked to arrive by 10:30 but were probably 5 minutes late and that wasn\u2019t a problem. After a short video explaining the rules, we boarded a minibus for a 20-minute ride to the site of the cave entrance. There we put our street clothes into lockers, showered, and got helmets and life vests (both required). You should bring your own water shoes, if you have them, as you will otherwise need to buy some (I think they were $10 US). Wet suits are optional; we didn't wear them and didn't regret that decision. There are 3 routes through the caves used by Rio Secreto and our guide took us on the one called \"Supreme\". This route is about 1.5 km in length. It involves some walking on dry ground, lots wading through ankle or knee high water, and a little swimming. My wife doesn't know how to swim, but since she had on a life vest, I was able to assist her through the deep sections. We probably spent about 2 hours underground. The accompanying professional photographer takes lots of pictures and will ask each member of the party to pose at various points. At the end, you will view the photos and be able to buy them for $70 or so. That was too expensive for us, but they did not pressure us. Our guide spoke very good English and was knowledgeable about the ecosystem and history of the caves. After the tour, you change and have a buffet lunch in their pavilion. We had a few minutes to hang out in their hammocks before the ride back to the parking lot. Overall, the experience was awesome and we were both very glad that we did it. It felt like we were really spelunking, as the caves have no fixed lighting system (but everybody's helmet has its own light)."

For the next 90 minutes you explore the magnificent wonders of the caves. A photographer follows your group and takes stunning pictures. When the water got deep our fabulous guide Evelyn took my feet and gently pulled me through. Our guide was passionate about what she does, having done over a thousand tours.

You start at a reception with a brief film about the caves and then are transferred along a pretty bumpy road. This is where you get all your equipment, water shoes are provided. Our guide, Carlos, then took us on a quick walk to be blessed by a Mayan priest before you enter. Now the caves. WOW!! They really are something else. Beautiful. You are taken on a tour of approx 1hour 30 around the caves. Sometimes having to swim in crystal clear waters. There really are some beautiful areas that look somewhat 'other worldly'. All very beautiful and something that can only be seen to be truly appreciatedFood afterwards was nice. Nothing special but nice non the less. I also wanted to mention our guide, Carlos, he was absolutely superb. You can tell he really loves what he does and was very knowledgable. I would request he was my guide if I am lucky enough to return."

            "review": "Fantastic excursion. We decided to take this tour because the weather forecast was rain for the day and we had a 10 year old who would have been complaining of boredom. First off, the weather has no impact on the tour because it's underground through a cave/cenote system. The system is about 34km, but you cover about 1km, taking a couple of hours. You walk/swim through the caverns while the guide (we had Francis) tells you everything you need to know and so many more interesting facts. My 10 year old is nervous about everything and this was dark, at times very compact, and in many water sections she was floating (more due to the lifejacket), but Francis made her feel safe and comfortable and she really enjoyed it as did we. So many facinating sights and absolutely beautiful scenes. Without his help at making her at ease we might not have had the wonderful experience we did. In total, with guide, their were eight people so the trip went at a smooth pace, he let us know about every nook and cranny as we approached so there were no injury issues, and everyone had a great time.If you are looking for a little adventure with a stunning natural backdrop and people working hard to ensure you enjoy, do yourself a favour and take this trip."

A bit rough walking in places. DO NOT GO IF YOUR UNSTEADY ON YOUR FEET. There are some places you could really hurt yourself badly if you fell. They offer a walking stick, i'm unsure if I would recomend it. As sometime later you will bob through some underground rivers like a cork and I think having the stick may take away from this liberating experience. There are SOME places that are a tight squeeze and you have to duck your head underwater to get under a low ceiling. If you CAN\"T easily bend down and touch your toes\u2026.it may pay to ask if there is an easier walk to go on! Unsure if I would say this is suitable for ALL children it is a dark cave system after all.However for anyone else able bodied, this is a must do.They do have a photographer follow you're tour group and you pose for pictures, this will be your ONLY source of photo's. They charge you about $79 or so for a CD. Don't be stubborn and dismiss this,... consider it an additional part of the experience. it does also include some generic photos of the caves etc.There is a reasonable meal at the end and they supply all necessary equipment. You can buy your own wet shoes to use on the tour and take with you for $10.All in all I would rate this as the number 1 attraction of the area."

A guide takes you into the entrance to the cave where the river is located. You're given instructions what you can and cannot do while in the cave and river. It takes approximately 45 min to an hour, which you spend walking in and out of the river and numerous sections of the cave. Some sections are very shallow and others require you to jump into the water. The temperature of the water is around 60 degrees. Upon emerging from the river and cave you turn in all your equipment and sit down for a great Mayan meal. A great time for refreshing yourself and filling up. Highly recommend going early in the day."

My husband and I booked this as one of our cruise excursions, and I am so glad he convinced me to do this. The ride to the site is a bit rough because the road isn't paved. Our driver to the site was cautious, but our driver on the way back seemed to hit every bump and pothole in the road.Once we got the site, we met our guide, Julio. He was the best. You could tell that he truly loved his job and was passionate about preserving the area and its beauty as well as the traditions of the Mayans. After we changed, locked up our belongings in the lockers provided, and showered (just to rinse off chemicals in order to preserve the water) we were fitted for gear. This included water shoes and wet suits (they allow you to use your own if you have it) as well as helmets and life jackets. You then walk down the path where you are blessed by a Mayan priest. Next is the best part - the cave! Seeing the formations, swimming in the cool water, and climbing through the cavern is one of the best things I've ever done in my life. I've seen the caverns and Ruby Falls in Tennessee, but this is so much better! You don't feel as though you are just walking through a tourist attraction with thousands of people - you get to go with a small group and really experience nature. My husband and I would not only recommend this trip, we hope we have the opportunity to do it again. And I will certainly ask for Julio to be our guide!"

For what we got (the tour, the equipment, the provided ride from our hotel, the meal, and a chance to hang out in the jungle area with hammocks), definitely worth the price. I had no problem with buying pictures because A. It was an experience I wanted to capture and keep with me for a very long time, B. The photographer did a great job, C. In return it actually helps keep the caves safe from attempts to build highways over it and destroy it as there aren't any protection laws against it. The photos are worth it in my opinion. However, if it seems to pricy for others, at least the experience will last you for a lifetime and might even be worth a second visit to explore more of the cave since there are different routes. I would definitely suggest to others!"

Getting to see the cave while swimming through the water is a memory to last a lifetime. Unfortunately as an amateur photographer myself my only complaint is the picture package they sell to you afterwards. They have a dedicated photographer take pictures of you throughout the tour as bringing your own camera is forbidden (even if its waterproof). They give you an option of $25 for one picture, $50 for two and $75 for the entire package. First I understand that the high price may be justified to cover for maintainence of the property and wildlife, and I am actually glad to contribute to this cause. However, all the pictures that we got are really really small (800 - 1200 pixels). Most pictures were did not even have enough resolution to cover my computer screen, forget about printing anything larger than a 4 x 6. It does not cost them any more money to give larger images so I don't know what their rationale is. I would still recommend the tour but if I knew this beforehand I would definitely have not bought the picture package."

We were a little wary of spending 79 dollars to see this as we read other cenotes in the area had very less entry charges but we went with it as it was recommended by the hotel but at the end we were very satisfied with the whole experience. The caves are spectacular and stunning and one feels like being in an Indiana Jones movie. A special mention to our guide RAUL, he was fantastic. He was so passionate about the caves, conservation and wildlife. Very informative and great sense of humour. My husband has a problem with claustrophobia but he was fine here. My boys aged 16 and 21 also totally enjoyed. Cameras are not allowed and would not be convenient to carry as it involves a bit of wading and swimming on the uneven rocks but a professional photographer follows you. Not recommended for elderly people. Buffet at the end was good. Only downside is that they could make the price for one copy of photo for keepsake a little reasonable after spending so much on the entrance (it is 25 dollars for one picture and 80 for the whole usb) All in all we loved the whole experience.

She did a great job making everybody feel comfortable and safe. Any kind of question she would stop and answer for us, and her knowledge on the area and the land was unbelievable.

You cannot see anything else like this anywhere in the entire world - take advantage of it while you are in Playa! My (21 year old) daughter and I were picked up about a block away from our hotel at 7:45am. After picking up the rest of the group (10 of us in total) at various other hotels, we arrived at the Rio Secreto entrance - which, by the way, is less than 10 minutes from Playa del Carmen.After receiving our wristbands and watching a short video on what was ahead of us, we got back on the bus and drove another 15 minutes up a very bumpy road to the actual location of the caves. We got lockers for our belongings, rinsed off in a (very cold) shower, and received our full gear - water shoes, wetsuits, life jackets, helmets, and a headlight. The caves themselves cannot be described in words - you truly have to see them for yourself. Even the best photographs do not accurately portray the beauty of the place. The tour guides are incredibly informative and keep you entertained the whole way through. There's also a photographer that follows alongside the group, and the photos he takes as well as shirts and other souvenirs can be purchased after the tour. A delicious buffet lunch is also served after the cave exploration! Really yummy food. Transportation is provided after the tour back to the hotels.Some tips: consider getting the \"walking stick\" that they offer at the beginning of the tour! The caves are rocky, uneven, and very painful if you happen to fall or scrape yourself. You also can't touch the limestone for conservation purposes, so having the stick there to brace yourself if you feel unsteady would be very helpful! Additionally, bring cash for tipping the driver, tour guide, and photographer - also if you want to purchase photos! You'll definitely want those to remember the experience. Do not hesitate booking Rio Secreto - you'll only regret it if you don't go!"

Add the opportunity to swim in the cenotes, spend so much time on the tour, and have a moment of silence and complete darkness in a silent, sacred place? That just takes it over the top. I enjoyed my time in the cave, with a small group of my fellow travelers, and with the guide Lalo and photographer Fernando.One small detraction was the emphasis on posing for photographs if (like me) you aren't intending to spend the money on their photography ($25-75). I understand the reasons behind not allowing cameras and taking professional photos, but I didn't love the posing. I felt it took away from the moment but that's just a personal preference. A few people from our group enjoyed the photos so I'm glad someone was able to capture the experience for them. The food afterwards was bien aut\u00e9ntica (authentic Mexican food). We had handmade tortillas, refried black beans, scrambled eggs flavored with a flower from the Yucatan, rice, pico de gallo with nopal cactus, and some hot sauces with agua de jamaica (hibiscus-flavored drink) to share with our group. I enjoyed my time on this unique excursion and recommend it to anyone traveling to this region."

Julian was very good, pointing out the interesting formations and helping the group in the more difficult areas.Our only negative point is regarding the photography. There is a large emphasis on posing for photographs at the various areas, which takes up a large amount of time. Whilst this is important to those who would like to buy these photos as you are not allowed your own camera in the caves, the price of the photographs was very high and put us off buying them, $25USD for one photo on a CD or $79USD for all the photos in May 2015."

If you are looking for a beautiful and tranquil underground experience, I highly recommend Rio Secreto. I selected this one because of the TA reviews, a total underground experience, close proximity to our resort, and Amstar provided this excursion from our resort.They provide water shoes, wet suit, helmet w/light, and walking stick. Wear your swimming suit under your clothes, so you can easily slip off your clothes and shower in the outside shower area before putting on the wet suit. You will wear your swim suit under the wet suit. They do have towels, but I suggest bringing one with you.I recommend using the walking stick since the ground is uneven, and it helps to determine the depth of the steps in front of you. There is one low area when you enter the cave that is a little challenging if you have bad knees; however, my 6 foot + tall husband was successful going through this area and the cenote.After the trip through the cenote, they provide a delicious meal. We had chicken, tortillas, rice, black beans, and fruit.You cannot bring a camera into the cenote, but they have a professional photographer with the group taking pictures. You can purchase one picture for $25.00 or the CD for $79.00. They take pictures from the beginning of the tour which begins with a ritual blessing until you depart the cenote. The CD includes pictures of the blessing, group and individual pictures inside and outside the cenote, and the beautiful environment in the cenote. I purchased the CD, and I'm so glad I did. It is well worth the money (see pictures). For the number of pictures you receive on the CD, the cost is approximately $1.00 per picture.Our guide, Pablo, was very friendly, informative, and concerned for the safety of all our group members. Thank you, Pablo!!! The groups do not exceed 10 members in order to provide a wonderful and safe experience. We had two children in our group, and they did just fine during the tour. There are 2 sections where you will need to swim.I'm so glad we selected Rio Secreto and will enjoy this experience for a lifetime as I look at the pictures over and over again."

I was standing in awe, unable to breathe easily. I was afraid to break that silence. I felt like I stepped into a holy place without permission. We chose Rio Secreto Plus, which was a mixture of riding a bike in a jungle full of butterflies, rappelling down to the cenote, and walking and swimming in the cenote. Our guide Alfredo had a great passion for Rio Secreto and cenotes. He showed us many interesting creatures living in Rio Secreto, and he taught us many things about the cenote. He was extremely kind and thoughtful, too. One of my friend couldn't swim well, and he was helping her throughout the whole trip. Our photographer Abraham was amazing too. He took time and effort to take our pictures, and it really showed in the photos. I strongly recommend Rio Secreto Plus, but only if you have high energy and adequate bike riding and swimming skill. Otherwise, I would recommend just simple Rio Secreto Tour. Whether your choose Plus or not, you will probably fall in love with Rio Secreto, once you visit the place!"

There were no crowds of people and everything appeared to be choreographed to perfection. The caves were extremely interesting as was Epco our guide. The rumours of extremely cold water are very misguided the water was cool/fresh but definitely not cold. Anyone with a worry of claustrophobia should not miss out. We did not feel unsafe all day. However, I would suggest that if you are infirm on your feet then care should be take; although, the guide was ready on hand at all the difficult places. Many thanks for a great experience."

The caves are absolutely amazing - breathtaking. Our guide, Raul, was so knowledgeable and so helpful. We learned more than we expected and came away with an appreciation for the caves, the Eco-system and the conservation efforts to maintain this beautiful piece of heaven. The terrain is uneven and has a few strenuous moments. You should not be claustrophobic of you visit here and the water can get deep enough that you need to swim - albeit with a life preserver and wet suit. "

We were in the caves for about 90 minutes with an excellent guide and photographer. We waded and in some cases swam through the underground rivers, saw resident bats and spiders, had a few minutes of complete silence in complete darkness which was very spiritual. The stalactites and stalagmites are amazing. This was followed by a wonderful lunch. The guides were terrific, our group was small, 6 people, and the photos (that you can purchase separately) that the photographer were wonderful. This is worth your time and money for a very unique and enjoyable experience."

After a 20 minute journey by van, we went into the jungle to get suited up for our adventure. Everyone was given wet suits, life jackets, water shoes, a helmet and walking stick and we were off. First, we were cleansed by a Mayan. It was very cool. We learned to say hello and thank you in Mayan, but I can't remember now! Then we walked into the cave. We did a lot of walking/hiking, so it was a good idea to have that stick! Eventually, we came to the part where we actually swam through the caves. Near the end of our adventure, they let us turn off our lights and we sat in total darkness. It was so cool to hear the sounds of the cave. What was supposed to be a 1.5 hour trip took about 2 hours, but I won't complain. It was amazing. And they provide a photographer, who captures your entire trip and lets you pose at many different stops. After the trip, we had a traditional Mexican lunch and then took the bus back.I absolutely recommend Rio Secreto to everyone!"

If you want to cool down after exploring the ancient ruins, or you just want to learn about the local ecosystem then this place is right for you. You'll be traveling 30+ meters underground, exploring the diamond blue rivers of fresh water and learning about the geological curiosities of Yucatan. Few tips: - if you can, ask for Carlos. He is a wonderful guide, really passionate about the preservation of this ecological marvel.- Don't forget to bring your own water shoes - lots of sharp edges there. You can rent/ask for the shoes at the place, but some are damaged and you never know what you'll get.- Cameras are not allowed inside, so all Facebook perfect pictures should be purchased after the tour. The quality of the pictures is not great and this service is way overpriced, but you can try and bargain your way out. Just make sure you pay cash (however, cards are accepted but this will nullify bargaining efforts)- you'll get a chance to try the local buffet (it's included) so try Lime Soep"

This was a great start to an amazing and wonderful experience. Our guide was Diana, who was excellent, funny, informative but overall clearly passionate about her job and her \"office\" ( the caves lol!) Following on from the light show, Diana took us to the area where we could change into our swimming costumes. The changing rooms were clean and well maintained. We were all given a secure locker to store all of our belongings, and then took a quick shower to remove any perfume, oils, sunscreen etc so as not to contaminate the water system and ecology below ground. All equipment was supplied, from water shoes, helmet with lamp, and a buoyancy jacket. The guides will show you why we need to shower, and why it is VERY important not to touch the formations you see - this is the most important piece of information they give you.Safety was excellent, and we had no concerns throughout the tour. I would say that whilst not requiring any athletic skill, you should be reasonably mobile, and have good balence as the tour requires walking across uneven surfaces, walking through water with uneven surfaces, and swimming. The tour guide can supply a walking stick if it will help with you balance.The sights you will experience are just amazing, and Diana even produced a special\" fireworks show\" for us! ( you have to do the tour to see what I mean!)I could write so much more, but overall you absolutely must go on this tour - a rare opportunity to experience first hand what so many more will only ever see in books or films!"

We were driven down a long dusty road to the cenotes where we met our guide Lemon and where we were to change into our bathing suits, given water shoes, lockers and keys for our stuff. We then took a cool shower to remove any chemicals so to not disrupt the natural pH balance of the waters and given wet suits an helmets with lights. Prior to entering the caves, its commonplace for a short blessing ceremony to take place by a Shaman who blesses your passage into the caves. The caves were amazing, otherworldly it seemed, it was quite enlightening to learn about the stalacite and stagamite. Our guide Lemon was very comical and kept us laughing throughout. There is usually another fellow following who takes pictures which you can purchase at the end. If you're lucky enough to get the same underworld route as ours, you'll get a kick out of what's known as \"The Stairway to heaven\" exit. We were now topside and walked a bit back to the main area where we were given lunch and some time to chill in hammocks before taking the vans back to our resorts. It was a great day, we met some really nice people in our group including a couple from Korea who didn't speak a lick of English. We were back at our resort before 3:00 pm to lounge by the pool catch some rays and have some Mojito's."

The excursion did not require extraordinary physical abilities, just easy hiking, some moderate walking over uneven surfaces, some under water and a bit of swimming. Doable for almost anyone in good health. They take photos you can buy later and serve you a delicious Mexican lunch. The photos are not the best, but buy them! You will need to look at them again to remember how magnificent this tour was! The caves were absolutely beautiful. So amazing and untouched. We were in constant awe. I could have stayed all day!

Having been in caves before as kids, I can't say the formations were much different except the way you view them with headlamps and flashlights is cool. The water parts are really pretty!!! Our tour was quite athletic. We rode bikes and rappeled into a deep hole which was awesome but hard for us beginners. Our small 5-person group was a total plus. The trek was a bit of a challenge at times with some real tight and tricky spots. We left with some scratches, callouses, and muscle soreness but thankfully no twisted ankles or broken bones. It would be an issue if you got hurt in the cave I think despite the guide being a trained paramedic. It was a bit cool in the water and almost 3 hours in the cave was a bit long because we got a little cold despite wetsuits after a few hours. We also got quite hungry even having had breakfast because our tour bus left Cancun at 7:30, we started ~10:30 and didn't get lunch till 2 or after. Snorkeling and biking parts were not really the highlights. The drive time to and from Cancun was also longer than we had hoped due to frequent stops (passenger pick ups and drop offs) which was really annoying. This is an all day thing and kind of wipes you out. Our guide Alfredo and photographer Juan were really great. Fyi, You cant take your own camera but the professional photos are cool if you want to buy them on cd for $80. Equipment and necessary gear were provided. Food was a good mayan/mexican buffet. Soda, bottled water, and other beverages other than a tea provided cost extra. We probably would have given 5 stars if it had been a much shorter day trip."

Decided to book this experience as a last minute thing, partly due to proximity to our hotel (Occidental Grand Xcaret) and partly due to the good reviews.We were picked up as arranged and driven to the attraction HQ where the guide went through the safety procedures and what we would see. It's worth pointing out that we were the only English couple on our tour of 9 people, but the guide went to great pains to explain everything in both Spanish and English. Our fellow tour members were a three generation family, and we all hit it off really well despite the language barrier. After the safety briefing there was a 20 minute drive through the jungle to the site of the cenote that we would be exploring.We were kitted out in wetsuits, helmets and life jackets after the mandatory cold shower to remove and sun cream etc which could contaminate the water.Then it was down the stairs into the cave itself. The cenote was only discovered in 2007, and the only things added are stairs down and stairs out again. Everything else is exactly as it was found. This is probably the closest you can get to a genuine caving experience, but at no time did it feel scary. To start with there is a bit of clambering and wading, with the guide explaining the cave features as we progressed. Further into the cave the water is deeper and swimming is required, but the buoyancy from the wetsuit and life jacket mean that even non swimmers will feel safe. The exit involves swimming through a pinch point where you have a few inches clearance between the water and cave roof, but again it never felt scary.There is a photographer with the group who records the whole experience and you can buy the photos on a CD at the end. These are pretty pricey at $79 for the set, which doesn't include any 'stock' cave shots so you may want to think a bit carefully about this.Once you leave the cave you change out of your gear and showers and towels are provided, and then proceed to a restaurant area for a perfectly decent lunch of traditional Mexican dishes. Be warned - the red chilli sauce is hot, but the green one is hotter!Overall this is an experience I wouldn't have missed, and a big vote of thanks has to go to our guide Julio for making it such an inclusive event."

I agree with other reviewers who say to ignore the complaints about not being able to take photographs and the cost of the pictures. Once you go, you will realize that having everyone taking their own pictures would be dangerous for the participants and for the cave, and the price just isn't that over the top...just budget for it, because you'll definitely want the pics.

We are mountain bikers, so the riding felt easy and flat, but lots of fun. The rappel into the cave was about 20-30 feet into a small hole that quickly opened up into a huge water cave. Also fun. We had lots of time to swim and explore the edges of this cave and enjoyed stories about the cave formation and wildlife.We left the cave via another exit and rode back through the jungle (fun in your bikini!) to don wetsuits.A brief stop with a beautiful medicine man who smudged us with chaparral before we entered the cave.This cave winded through open spaces, to tighter areas that you could just float through under stalactites. The guide Jorge was great- lots of great stories and explanations.The photos, yes, were very expensive (especially with the Canadian-USD exchange rate), but worth it for the keepsakes, and they were quite good.Remember to pose for them, or get some in special spots if you think of it, because they are all included if you buy the lot!"

This cave system was only discovered in 2006 and opened to the public in 2008; because it's part of the freshwater system for the entire Yucatan Peninsula (if I remember correctly), there is a very real chance that new laws could close this location to the public at some point - so we were glad to have the experience while we could!From youngest (8) to oldest (40), we were all wowed by the opportunity to swim in an underground river. Our guide, Yayo, was friendly and incredibly knowledgeable, and since our \"group\" consisted solely of our family, it was like having a private tour.The best part was when we reached the area that was deep enough for swimming, and Yayo had us turn off All.The.Lights. It felt like what I imagine a sensory deprivation tank to be like, but amazingly none of us felt claustrophobic or scared.The Mexican buffet at the end was delicious!And yes, the photos are spendy (we spent $89 for a USB stick with 100+ photos), but not any more so than the other excursions we've done in the past (e.g. dolphin experiences, etc.). We highly, highly recommend this for anyone that is up for the uneven surfaces inside the caves (they do have walking sticks available, FYI)."

            "review": "Unique \"must do \" excursion!. This is such a fun, unique, educational excursion. Your day starts with a bumpy twisty and turny ride back into the jungle. You stop to watch a quick video about the caves and the steps we were going to go through before the adventure started. First you must take off jewelry, hats, sunglasses, shoes and remain in your bathing suit. Lockers are provided free of cost. Next, you are given water sox to borrow, or you can purchase your own. Then, since the cenote is fresh water it is required that you rinse your body off in an outdoor shower. This is to remove oils, creams, lotions, etc that could make the water impure over time. No big deal! The next step was everyone is given a wetsuit. Now the fun starts! Lol! We had a group of 12 people and we all were hysterically laughing as we tried to squish into the suits! You are also given life vests and helmets with lights since the cave is completely dark. You walk a little bit further into the jungle and then you see the entrance to the cave. The feeling is excitement, nervous energy as you descend into the cave and water. Our tour guides RAUL P. was amazing! He was the perfect mix of humor, and interesting facts. He moved at a great pace so people of all fitness levels and ages could keep up. The water is fairly chilly, but the wetsuit helps keep you warm. We saw such amazing beauty on the formations under ground. It was so cool to see how over thousands of years the stalagmites and stalactites have formed. They have a person taking your photos which was actually nice because you didn't have to worry about where is the perfect spot or keeping up with a camera. The photos are reasonably priced, and you get alot on the disk...posed, natural, and some stock photos of the cave. After the tour is a lunch, which is pretty decent authentic Mexican food. Our group was so psyched about what we had just done, we had no complaints! This is a great excursion for adventurous couples who want to have a once in a lifetime experience together!"

It did not disappoint!This was the very BEST excursion of our 10 day trip. We had a very knowledgeable guide- Julio- who is passionate about his work, the environment, and the culture of the area. We had two teenagers with us, one was a 14 yr old boy who was not impressed by much. Less than 15 minutes into the tour he exclaimed that this was the best, and the rest of the week he compared everything we did to this excursion. I personally was very impressed that it wasn't treated as just a regular tourist activity, but that spiritual reverence was given; in a blessing with copal, in the way the trees and plants are treated (this is in the jungle!), and in the treatment on the caves and water. Highly recommended for anyone who can hike and do basic swimming."

When we arrived they told us to shower, which was outside to remove the lotions from our skin. This is to protect the water environment in the caves. They provide an optional wet suit which I used as well as many of the others and a mandatory life vest and helmet with a light attached to it. They also provided us walking canes to help us maneuver the area we would have to walk through. Before we entered the cave, a Mayan priest said a prayer over us to protect us and ask permission for us to enter the cave. This was really nice! There is a photographer with us the whole time to take pictures and you can purchase these at the end of the tour.Julian was our tour guide and he was really nice. We turned off our lights several times to get a feel of what it was like to be in the cave while it was totally dark and quiet. You could hear the water tinkling and you couldn't even see your hand in front of you. It was totally dark and awesome! We swam around in some of the deeper areas and took our time going through the cave. If you don't know how to swim its no problem because you can float with your vest holding you up. We had several individual who could not swim but they had a good time because they would float right next to us.After we came out of the cave they fed us lunch which was very good with some hibiscus tea that was also very good. You have to pay extra if you want soda and chips.I would do this excursion again it was so much fun!!!"

Diana was our tour guide and she was excellent. Well worth the tip that we left behind for her - noticed that others in our group didn't, so felt a bit bad about that.They have a photographer join in on the tour, so try and sell you pics at an outrageous price at the end, which I thought was a bit of a shame. They serve lunch, however if you are coming from an all inclusive resort, it just doesn't compare.Tour as a whole, it well worth the $$. I highly recommend it."

If they had installed some lights (like was implied in the tour propaganda photos) then it would have looked more impressive. At the end they make you walk through a shop where they show photos taken of your group and of course try to get you to buy them. All the photos of our group were slightly blurry, which my husband identified as a backfocus issue on the camera lens (we've had the same problem with our own camera.) When he talked to the photographer about it, they insisted there was no problem. The lunch served afterwards was uninspiring cafeteria style."

We had a flawless 8 AM pickup from our hotel (with the usual stops for others at other hotels) and got to Rio Secreto about 45 minutes later.Once there, we got our bracelets, and then a briefing and short video about the attraction. You can buy water shoes for $10 USD at this point, if you like, but they supply w\u00e1ter shoes later. We got in another van and got a deep tissue massage, courtesy of the bumpy, dirt road drive to the next stop. It\u00b4s not too long a drive - less tan a half hour for sure.You need to dump all of your belongings at your locker after the van ride, so - no cameras, nothing goes in the caves with you. You strip down to your bathing suit and then squeeze into a wetsuit, life jacket and helmet. Take a walking stick. They come in very handy.There is a short hike to a Mayan (?) who blessed us before we entered the caves. Then it was headlamps on and into the caves. The walk through the caves was not terribly slippery because the watershoes gripped well. There are a few climbs and drops but nothing treacherous. The w\u00e1ter that you sometimes walk and swim through is cristal clear and warm with a very few fish.The caves are gorgeous and sometimes very high - sometimes so low that you need to duck to not hit the roof of the cave. Bad scene if you are claustrophobic.Our guide, Alina, was amazing. She was profesional, friendly and fluently shifted from English to Spanish to Russian. She was quite knowledgeable and very safety-conscious.The Suprema cave route that we were on is only open sometimes because high w\u00e1ter often makes it impassable. After exiting, there was another very short hike back to the lockers.Lunch was next, with an egg dish, a couple of rice dishes, soup and lots of fruit. A fruit drink was supplied and beer was $4.After lunch, we got herded into a room to view the photos that they took while we were in the caves. They were really expensive ($25 for one) and the ones of our group were bad. Really bad. It might have helped if I had known that some of the shots were group shots and I might have smiled for them instead of thinking my solo photo was going to be taken next.It was a great experience and highly recommended. I suggest having some dollar bills for tips and also that you not wear prescription sunglasses into the caves. I did, and had to take them off because the light from the headlamps was too dim to see anything. The w\u00e1ter temperature in the caves is not uncomfortable at all. It was a most unique swim!"

The bus picked us up at 6am and we arrived at 830 am. You get to a place that's similar to a welcome center. Here you will sign a waiver, bathroom facilities are offered and you get assigned your tour guide. We had Gorge. Highly recommend him! From what I remember he was part of the exhibition team that was first to go in and check out this cave once it was discovered 7 years ago. Lots of knowledge!From this point you get into a smaller bus that goes far into the jungle on dirt roads. I loved it! That part added to the fun that was ahead. Once you arrive at the site you get a locker, wet suit,water shoes, and helmet. The tour guides inform you to check your equipment because Scorpions have a tendency to crawl in there. Well, someone in my group found one in their wetsuit so be careful. Next you move on to the prayer area (you don't have to participate if you don't want to). Then to the cave you go! If you like adventure this tour is for you! It's educational along with being a great adventure. You do have to swim in different locations. Some spots are over 10 feet deep just a heads up. It's an amazing experience! When you come out of the cave you get a shot of local liquor that tastes like black liquorice. After the tour you eat local food in a cabana style structure.

But it was once-in-a-lifetime experience to see nature in all its perfection. To management, though, I wish it could be a more peaceful tour. The guide kept telling stories along the way - he was doing his job - but it kinda ruined the magic of the quiet moments underground. Maybe tell us everything they want BEFORE entering the cave? Then in the cave, you should keep the yelling/shouting/giving directions to what's necessary. Although, while we understand that you care for our safety,you didn't need to yell at a poor old couple who couldn't walk fast enough to catch up with the group. I think people want to the experience to be spiritual; so yelling should be prohibtted. Also, definitely more swimming time! A few minutes are not enough. And would definitely be great if we could bring a camera! Would give like a two-star for the tourguide / management; but the cave itself is a must-see!"

Told us exactly what we needed to do without being pushy and explained everything in clear detail. We were given wet suits, water shoes, helmets and life vests (even small kid sizes). They offered an optional walking stick, which I took just in case. Turned out to be very helpful. Everyone should take one.The cave was super cool. I was initially concerned one or both of my kids (6.5 and 9 yrs old) would be scared or have problems, but we took our time, let them ride on our backs through the deeper water areas, and held their hands through all the tight spots. Epco (our guide) was very patient and aware of their needs and offered many suggestions on where to walk, where to step and not to step, etc. Much to my delight, our kids loved every second of it and never fell, slipped or cried once. Rio Secreto does get very dark (we actually turned off all our lights at one point to focus on the sounds of the cave), so keep that in mind.Like some other area attractions, no cameras are allowed in the cave. Instead a photographer from Rio Secreto follows your group and takes photos along the way. Upon exiting the cave and seeing the images I was initially very dissatisfied with the image quality and commented on how blurry they appeared. Someone working there said (in broken English) that the screen on the iMac was low resolution, which I interpreted as B.S. Faced with the prospect of having nothing to remember the trip by, I went ahead and shelled out $75 for the CD of images. Much to my surprise, the images on the CD looked way, way better! They must have loaded image previews/thumbnails at the store, which would explain why they initially looked so bad. So, so glad I bought the CD.All told, it was an awesome little expedition. You'll love it."

On this trip we went for it and I was glad I did. The drive up to the place is the hard part. Plenty of ruts and holes in the dirt road so be prepared to have your \"preserves jarred!\" Once we got there they broke us up into groups - English, French or Spanish speaking etc. - which was very smart - and put a guide who spoke that language in charge of each group. We got into wet suits and helmets with lights, put our personal stuff into lockers, got a little info from the group leader, a blessing from a local and off we went. The water is clean and cool. The caves are beautiful! They give you water shoes to keep your feet safe as the floors are very uneven and slippery - but there is very little risk of injury as they give you a walking stick if you want one or have someone hold your hand every step of the way if necessary. However, I would not recommend this for the elderly or small children.Some areas of the cave the water is deep and you can float along through those areas with your life jacket on.There is lots to learn from the guide, professional photos are taken for you all through the event and then at one point they turn off all the lights (on your helmets) and you are in complete darkness. It's amazing and I can't wait to do it again!"

Our tour guide was very knowledgeable. Our group consisted of 4 adults and 6 kids 8-14. Everybody had a fun time. I would not recommend for anybody who has physical ailments as this is a physical activity. You need nothing except a bathing suit. Everything else's is included. Wet suits, life jackets, water shoes, and a mining helmet with an attached flashlight. There is a meal at the end that was so so but they tried hard to please us. The only real negative is that they will not allow for any photos (real, phone, go-pro, etc). This is so they can charge you an exorbitant amount of money for the package. It would have been nice to have some memories but I'm not paying $150 for a few pics!"

Carlos was our guide, he was great with the kids, knowledgeable and fun. Our group was about 12 people. It was tougher than I thought it going to be... in and out of water, rough terrain underground and above. It felt like a real adventure. We spent 3ish hours there I think. Included getting gear on, hiking a little to the cenote, exploring underground for an hour?, then eating a decent lunch buffet with the group. It was our daughter's b-day the next day and Carlos brought out a special brownie surprise and we all sang... Good stuff! We booked same day. As we were staying downtown Playa, we grabbed a taxi out there and hopped on a \"colectivo\" to get back. Very easy. Yes, they don't allow photography which I was disappointed with at first. But quickly I understood why. It's hard enough to walk through all together w/o taking pics. There is a pro photographer that follows the group. They charge a lot, but I think it's worth it. (should go w/o saying in Mexico, but you should haggle a bit). A highlight of our vacation!"

Best part is that I prefer to swim on my back and with the light on my helmet, I lit up the ceiling as I floated along. Phenomenal! Great colours among the thousands of stalactites. At one point, we just floated in complete darkness and silence for a couple of minutes. It was the closest one could come to floating in space. One recommendation: Take a walking stick. You don't need a big or tall one, but it makes it so much easier to navigate the areas of shallow water.And when they give you the choice between finishing up with a swim or walk...take the swim."

The only reason they don't allow cameras is so that they can sell you photos later for $79. A total rip off.Also, the food was not very good. Everything was bland and the chicken was hard."

We went early, picked up at our hotel at 6:50am. I know, ugh, but we were the first tour group out and then were back at our hotel to enjoy a whole afternoon at the pool, so it was worth it to us. Victor was our tour guide and he was great! He was very knowledgable and very good about letting us know how to safely navigate the cave. The cave was amazing! One of the coolest things I have ever done. You have to be very careful walking and swimming, but what you get to see is awesome. They provide all the gear that you need including wetsuits, water shoes, helmets, and towels. The only unpleasant part is taking the cold outdoor shower before putting on your wetsuit! After the tour everyone who wants to or is of legal age gets to take a shot of a very good Mayan liquor as a celebration. Our course they also sell bottles in the gift shop, but we thought this was a nice touch to end our tour. After you change you get to eat from their local food buffet. It was all good, especially the lime soup and the hibiscus water. My only complaint about the trip was the very bumpy ride in a van from the check in point back to the tour starting point. I get motion sick very easily and this was pushing the limits of what I can handle. My advice is to sit as close to the front of the van as you can. I was in the back on the way there and it was rough. I sat in the front on the way back and it was much better. The only advice I would give is that this is recommended for ages four and up. It is a pretty rough tour so I would think any kids under the age of eight would probably struggle. Also anyone with any mobility issues would probably have a rough time as well. Overall a great trip and not something to miss!"

This is as close to legit caving as you can get and still be a tourist destination. Our guide, Alfredo, was awesome. He obviously loves his job and did his best to help us share that love. I was expecting more of a river float, but in fact this is a cave. No lights, minimal paths, some very low ceilings. Your guide's flashlights and your helmet light are the only things keeping you out of darkness! The first part of the exploration is on land with the second half moving through the water which was very refreshing. Loved the experience and loved Alfredo!"

We booked through the Norwegian Sun and everything went flawlessly. Our guide Victor was very informative and patient- how lucky is the Mayan hunter who found this place! From poor to a millionaire!Overall it was a great experience except for one thing...THE PICTURES WERE TERRIBLE!!!! We NEVER buy pictures but from ones we have seen on TripAdvisor, we went in thinking we would buy the big $79 package. WRONG. I was so disappointed with the poor quality of them. The lightning was nothing like I had seen in other pictures. We did end up buying one, but even the one we purchased was not spectacular. TIPS (From someone who booked through a cruise line)- You ONLY GET 90 minutes in the cave. Victor said they had longer trips but those were for people staying at nearby resorts.- Cozumel is an island, so you have to take a 45-minute ferry ride to and from Playa Del Carmen. Bring snacks for the ferry ride. I get very motion sick, and the boat was obnoxious for me.- It is VERY physical. If you cant bend down, don't do it. If you can't swim, don't do it. If your body aches at all, don't do it. The tour company stressed this many times, but you will have a horrible experience if you are not in decent physical condition. - Afterwards, you will have time to shop in Playa Del Carmen. You might as well shop here, as there was a great variety of items to purchase. You will have time in Cozumel, but it's very rushed."

While the weather was awesome, a day in a park with a lot of sun and big crowds lost out to this surprise for our son. Boy, were we ever pleased with our choice.After a ferry to Playa del Carmen from our drop off point in Cozumel (approximately 20 min. of travel) we boarded our bus to the site. Highway traffic for 10 minutes ended on a bumpy and hilly 20 minute drive to the Rio Secreto. We didn't hate the drive....we just went with the flow.We met CARLOS -- our guide for the day. He was awesome. We showered, got on our shorty wet suits, booties, helmets and lifejackets. We're strong swimmers and I didn't think we needed all the gear .....than is until we got into the caves.(Note: You have the option of being given a wooden staff. Take it. It's like a third leg in this cave system and allows you extra balance while climbing in these uneven caves.)We had a Mayan ceremony before we were escorted down into the caves and the coolness of the caves was a blessing from all the heat and sunshine. We travelled through a couple of kilometers of caves -- over, under and through so many formations. It was really neat. Once the group turned off all of our headlamps it was amazingly dark. CARLOS was awesome. Helpful and full of information. The kids in our group really liked his interaction and the photographer with us was more of an afterthought. You aren't allowed to take your camera below, so they provide you with one for the optional photo package afterwards. The gear provided us with enough protection from the stones and outcroppings. Even with the gear, one of our party sliced up a finger and I took a good scrape out of my shin. Most of the time we floated and bounced through the cave system. The water was cool and refreshing and the tour moved nicely. In total, our group was 9 people and we were told they never take more than 10 through. Even with the numbers above ground, we only saw one group in the caves.Lunch was nice and filling and included in the price. Overall, a super time if you're looking for a unique excursion."

Even if you aren't a good swimmer, you can do it because the water is not too deep. There was only 1 point in which you had to float w/ the life jacket, but it was harmless. I don't recommend it for children younger than 14 because of all the rocks and need to keep your balance. Diana N. was a spectacular tour guide - request her if you can!"

The overall cost for the 4 of us (+ you have to buy their photos if you want any which were crazy $$- we still ended up getting them) was close to $450. Value wasn't really there.

I have been in caverns before, but this was much more interactive because you go into the waters yourself and theres no one else there but your group and tour guide. My husband and I did this as an excursion from our cruise in March 2015. We were glad to get out of the crazy Playa del Carmen to a quite natural area. We first change into our bathing suits, water shoes, wet suits, and helmets. After that we walked through the woods and met a Mayan who did a little ceremony to allow us into the cenote. After walking a little further into the woods, we entered the cenote and it was magnificent. This is an experience everyone should have... showing how beautiful this world is. Yayo was our tour guide, and he was magnificent. He truly loved what he did and taught us all a lot. He added a lot of excitement and adventure to our journey through. The only downer for me was that you were not allowed to bring your camera along with you, as they take photographs of the group (and posed pictures at certain stops). The whole CD was $75 and one photo was $25! It does all go for a good cause, to keep the land to the Mayans and natural. Afterwords, they had a Mayan lunch planned for us, which was pretty tasty. I would recommend this journey for anyone in the area. We found Playa del Carmen too touristy for us, so Im glad we made this journey!"

Some of us had done Xcaret and some hadn't seen any caves yet; though we had done an excellent excursion to Chichen Itza earlier in the week. I was surprised at how natural the caves have been kept and the rustic-ness of the experience. Aside from a small step down at the beginning, you're walking thru the caves much as they must have been when found. It's almost all walking, not floating/lazy river for those that thought this would be more like Xcarat or Xel-Ha. Though a few places where it's deep enough for a short swim. There's no ropes, steps, etc. Just you, your guide and the headlamps. Oh, and your photographer. While I was a bit miffed at the beginning to not be allowed our camera, I was glad enough to be able to focus on the experience. I do think the pics are far too expensive, and the hard core haggling needed to get a more reasonable price took the shine off an otherwise great visit (still think they are too expensive).On the positive side, it is a stunning visual experience. Our guide was Allan, and I think he did a great job showing us around. Allan was especially supportive of the few of us that needed some extra care with some of the sections. It's not hard but this is not a smooth, polished experience. Part of the fun!I liked that you had the choice of bring your own water shoes, use theirs for free or buy your own (which were the same price as our hotel, so not bad). All helmets did the trick (we had a few bumps so we put them to the test) and all headlamps worked very well. Especially nice is that the groups were spaced out well, so that we didn't see anyone else in the cave but our own.So aside from the photo haggle/hassle, a great experience and one of our vacation highlights."

You cannot wear jewelry (not even a watch) and you must take a rinse shower before taking the tour.You\u2019ll disembark, walk from the disembarkation pier to the next pier over and board a large ferry boat (air conditioned on the first level and covered/open air on the top level). The ferry will then take approximately 45 minutes, bringing you to Playa del Carmen. You\u2019ll then be directed to a guide and you will walk approximately 5-10 minutes to a van. The van ride then takes about 30 minutes to the site. Once at the site, you will be given a safety briefing and all necessary gear. That includes an optional wetsuit, a lighted helmet, a life vest and water shoes. You will also have free lockers available.That being said, the experience was amazing and not to be missed, so don\u2019t be discouraged by all the travel time. The caves were breathtaking and our guide (Victor) was awesome. We were told there are three different underground rivers to explore, and the one you experience is dependent upon when you arrive. The stalactites and stalagmites were absolutely beautiful, and the water was a cool 75 degrees.Most of the people in our group wore wetsuits. I chose not to, simply because I didn\u2019t want something too restrictive. Although the guides recommend you wear a wetsuit, it isn\u2019t mandatory. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t wear one, because I think it would have been too warm. 75 degree water may sound chilly, but after traversing the caves, it\u2019s very refreshing.After the tour is over, they provide a buffet style lunch with traditional Mayan food. The food was much better than I expected. If you have the opportunity to take this tour, take it. The guides are very knowledgeable and friendly, and the scenery is incredible. At the end of the tour, we had an opportunity to do about 40 minutes of shopping in Playa del Carmen. The return to the Cozumel port, is the reverse. Walk, van ride, walk, ferry, walk."

            "review": "Intimate and breathtaking experience. My family experienced Rio Secreto while on a Western Caribbean Cruise for March Break. This excursion was offered from the port of Cozumel. The excursion was 7 hours so we were all a little leary about committing that much time but it was well worth it. After a short high speed ferry ride from Cozumel to the mainland, we were met by the tour guides and quickly bussed 20 minutes away to the site. After a lengthy process of being outfitted for the tour we were ready to go for a hike into the \"jungle\" (it wasn't really...) and we were blessed by a local prayer which was nice.We arrived at the entrance to the cavern not knowing what to expect and were transported into a completely new world 70feet underground wading through the most clear mineral water and thick colums of stagmalite that has formed over thousands of years. The best part of the exploration was when we had some time to sit in the complete darkness and feel the peace of a time long ago and also when we could float or swim around the deep clear pools. I wish there were more time for this activity! All together we were underground for 1 1/2 hours but it flew by. We had a photographer follow our small group of 10 and we could buy the CD afterwards for a pricey $60 (of course we had to buy it!)The excursion was followed by a taste of a local liquer and an authentic Mexican buffet. Thankfully we could purchase a Dos Equis to wash down the lovely meal.All in all well worth the time and cost of the excursion. This adventure is only for those who can handle the bumpy bus ride, brisk hike, and climbing through the cavern. I'm not in amazing shape, but it wasn't too challenging for me :-) although there was a gentleman in our group who was struggling so head their restrictions to be safe."

In the cave you cannot touch anything, and there is nothing to lean on for balance except your stick (not much help), or to steady yourself as you walk over very uneven ground. There is a fair amount of swimming, too, and not all that much to see. Great nature, but a bit underwhelming and harder than it is represented"

THis wasn't so much laid back but something I will NEVER forget!!!!!! We brought some bottled water (my tip to travelers, lots of water lol) and our own water shoes (cause I skeeve feet) we had to wear some silly gear but it was all good. I choose to take advantage of the walking stick that was offered and I was glad I did. Rol (Rodrigo) was our tour guide and he was very very good. He knows these caves I will give him that, and he's so comfortable in them that I felt at ease. A blessing was first and to take part in such an ancient ritual was awesome. After a short walk through the jungle (dare I say????) the enthusiasm was building, the pictures just don't do it justice. You really have to experience it. You climb over and under these delicate rocks the whole thing is an oxymoron. To sit in complete darkness and silence and be one with nature. You can hear the water drips creating these stalactites and stalagmites (and I know its more than water, the whole limestone, calcium carbonate, and carbon dioxide etc.) it's amazing I was in awe complete awe. The exploring through the cave reminded me of the Goonies (and I wasn't the only one lol) and the tree roots seeping down to the water crazy nature. I hope to return again just laying in the hammocks outside was perfect! Buy the picture package it's worth it. Lot's of so so pictures of me but the documents of the experience was worth it. We got some kind of deal $119, all the pictures on disk, a souvenir book, a tshirt, and a camouflage hat. They give you a small meal at the end of the tour, the green \"salsa\" is HOTTTTTTT some chips, salsa, diced chicken, rice and beans, corn tortillas, fruit, I don't remember what else honestly that's all I ate."

It was extremely interesting to learn about the 700km cave system below the Yucatan peninsula and how it was revered by the Mayan people. Our tour guide covered a lot of information...not just on the formation of the caves and their historical significance, but also what lives in the caves now and the future of the cave system. How much walking vs. swimming you do inside the cave will depend on the season and how much rain they've received. We visited this March and it was about 50/50 walking and swimming/wading. Everyone was required to put on a wetsuit, water shoes, life jacket, and helmet with an attached headlamp - so if you don't know how to swim, you'll be fine! The water was cool but not uncomfortably so. Even a mildly claustrophobic person would probably be okay with this tour. There are some spots you need to squeeze through, but even in those areas the cave is very large and open - you just have to get between two rock formations in order to stay on the designated path (this protects the cave from excessive wear and tear). I would NOT recommend this tour for anyone who is feeble or unsteady on their feet, however. The cave floor is very uneven and often times sloped and slippery. They offer everyone a walking stick before going into the cave, but I'm not sure how much that would have helped in some instances. We did walk about 10 minutes each way through the jungle to get to the cave opening, and the path was uneven and rocky there too (what can you expect - it's the jungle). Upon returning to the hut and collecting our belongings, we were taken to a souvenir shop to look at our tour photos - sadly, they were all horribly unflattering. And they were also very, very expensive to purchase! A buffet-style lunch was included after the tour - the food was just okay.The only thing I did not like about the experience was all the rigamarole to actually get to the \"tour\" part of the trip. When we arrived at Rio Secreto we first stopped at a ticket hut near the entrance and got our wristbands. Then we were taken to another hut where we filled out waivers. Then we walked through some sticks to another van and were driven like 20 minutes through the jungle to yet another set of huts, where we were shown to our lockers and the restrooms, walked to the showers (yes, a very brisk shower is required before entering the cave), and finally given our equipment for the tour. It was then that we set out through the jungle. It just seemed like we spent a lot of time going from place to place and not as much time with the tour guide as I expected. Fortunately, the trip home was much more efficient - we went directly from the last set of huts back to the resort."

A photographer came with us and took many great pictures. We purchased the CD at the end for around $75 (we were three couples so we split it which wasn't bad).When we were done, they had a buffet lunch of rice, beans, chicken, veggies and fruits.

They are very prompt.-If you get carsick, go prepared and take your meds or wear your bracelets as they vehicles are a little bumpy and swerve a bit to avoid rough patches and holes...(A side note: My daughter bought me little bracelets with pressure points that are supposed to be for seasickness. I was dubious because they don't seem to have much to them but they worked great!!) -Pay attention! On one trip out to the site, we spotted a huge cat dash across the road in front of us...turns out it is a rare type of Jaguar that is so elusive it is almost never seen and one of our guides captured a picture of it. On another trip, we spotted a spider large enough to watch it strut across the road! It was huge! Keep an eye peeled for unusual things you might see as you go through the jungle area.-When you arrive at the site, listen! The guides will explain how the caves were discovered and are really knowledgeable. My favorite guide was a graduate from the University with a Masters degree and you could tell he was so passionate about the information he was eager to share. -I was really concerned about being cold as I get cold quite easily and the thought of being underground worried me. The wetsuits they provide were wonderful. I didn't feel cold at all. You will wear a helmet with a light to help you make your way through the caverns. All of it was very comfortable and everyone was very helpful in making sure you are suited up properly.-Before you enter the cave, you will receive a blessing from a Mayan priest. There is a feeling of being part of something very special and a bit profound.-The journey through the caverns is slow and cautious. There is a sense of a team in that you accept help from the person in front of you at times and you turn to help those behind you. When you are in areas where it is rockier or narrow, that helping hand is really helpful. -Be aware that the caverns will go from being dry and rocky to ankle deep in water to shoulder deep. There are a few places where you actually dog paddle to the next dry spot. The water level changes according to how much rain they have had but it is really an exciting experience. The swim through the cavern is amazing because you are swimming in relative darkness and it is humbling to be that far underground and making your way through this maze of natural formations and water....just breathtaking.-It is important to keep from touching the walls around you as it can damage the ecosystem of the caverns. -There is a phosphorous pool that is breathtaking...and a huge open cavern that is awe-inspiring. Our guides had us turn off our lights for a minute or two to experience a depth of darkness that is unrivaled. It is absolutely profound.-While I want everyone to experience this trip through the caverns, it should be noted that there is some stepping up and down from rock ledges and such and that it might be hard if you have a severe back problem...but we had people of all ages and body types on our tours and everyone did just fine. -There is a photographer who accompanies your group and he takes some awesome photos. The photos are a bit pricey but my only regret is the one trip I took when I declined the photos. I will always buy them on future trips.-After exiting the caverns, they served a very good lunch prepared there and we had the opportunity to ask our guides questions and take photos.-I will take the tour again...and probably again....There is something unique and very special about the experience. I think anyone who is up for the walk should do this excursion at least once.I encourage"

            "review": "A MUST See - my favorite attraction in the area. We went to Tulum, Chichen Itza and Rio Secret and Rio Secreto was our favorite destination! There are so many cenotes in the area and it was not easy to pick just one but I did a lot of research (thanks TripAdvisor!) and so glad that I decided to Rio Secreto! You can book your trip on their website but I was having technical difficulties and ended up using their 'live help' feature and booking my tour through them. They gave me %15 discount, which was a nice bonus!Also, there were no transportation options available for the date I wanted to go, so my family just ended up taking a cab to Rio Secreto from our hotel in Playa Del Carmen (Paradisus) - it was a short 20 min ride and ended up costing us around $25 or so. And that was cheaper and a lot more convenient(!) than using the transportation option provided by Rio Secreto. Coming back from Rio Secreto we were able to use one of the mini vans they use to take you to and from the cenote - and that also was around $25 and so convenient. So depending on where you are coming from, you may want to consider skipping the transportation option provided by Rio Cenote and cabbing it instead.Now back to the cenote - although the whole tour is 3.5 hours, you only spend about 1.5 hours - 1.45 hours in the cenote - the rest of the time is taken between filling out paperwork, driving through the jungle to the cenote, changing into wet suites, changing out of the wet suites, looking at pictures and eating lunch. But we felt that the time we spent in the cave was enough. It was really stunning - caves are not lit up but each tour guide has a flash light and each person on the tour has a flash light on their hard hats so we were able to see everything OK. The tour is a partly walking/partly swimming - it was not difficult - we had our 7 year old twins with us and they did great. You don't need to know how to swim well, they give you life jackets so you can float.No cameras are allowed inside but each tour has a photographer with them, he takes pictures that you can purchase at the end. We ended up buying all pictures - $109 included a CD with all the images PLUS three items from the gift store, which we thought was a bargain.Overall, it was a great experience, my kids absolutely LOVED it (even though at first they were not very convinced about leaving the comfort of the hotel) and I highly recommend it."

If you want to see caves that are 100% real, deep underground, this is a must. It can't be described how breath taking or spectacular this tour is. What a special day. Be prepared, it can be quite a tricky walk through the water/rocks/cave ... not for someone that has trouble balancing or walking with ease. ps don't watch a horror cave movie before going...lol"

            "review": "A really good experience. This is a really good half day excursion. Guides are very knowledgeable and cave is beautiful. Here is what to expect. You will arrive at the location and watch a short video about the cave. You will link up with your guide and then your group will transfer to a bus. The road to the cave is extremely bumpy. Do try to sit in the front of your bus if you get motion sick. The shocks on the buses are poor and the drivers swerve around huge pot holes. Once you reach the end of the road, you will undress (down to your swimwear) and put all your clothes and personal items into a free locker. The locker key will be a bracelet so don't worry, you won't lose it. They will then provide you with water shoes. These are a must, the rocks in the cave are very sharp. You will then be asked to shower outside to wash off any sunscreen, dirt, perfumes, etc. They will fit you in a wetsuit, a helmet and then a life jacket. Once your group is fit, you will take a short walk through the rainforest. A Mayan priest will give a short blessing before you head into the cave. Once in the cave it is only a few steps before you get to the water. The water is chilly and the wet suits help keep you warm. if you can't walk well this is probably not the adventure for you. Yes the guide will help and there are walking sticks but let's be honest, you have to jump around in water where you can't see very well. Don't be nervous by your photographer, he takes a few alternate paths to make sure he can capture some really great photos. The heart and lungs section of the cave is the only place where you will really be able to swim. My favorite part was the last \"swim\" as you go down a very narrow exit and your head is just inches away from the top. It was a really cool adventure."

This is raw, natural and pretty much untouched. yes you must pay attention to where you step and where your head is but take a second to look around and the beauty of it all is there to see.

We chose it because it was one of the few 1/2 day adventures leaving us to enjoy our all inclusive resort and beach in the afternoon. My first impression was wow, this feels authentic and not like the typical tourist traps so common. The second, our guide, Carlos is very passionate about what he is showing us. We spent 2 hours touring the underground network spellbound by the natural beauty. The photos shown online are not typical of what you might see here and there but what you will see for the entire tour! A small buffet it provided and I'd recommend using their booties as they will keep the limestone pebbles from gathering in open sandals. While not as vast as the Grand Canyon or Rockies in its' own way it still provides that experience that you can only feel when you are experiencing yourself."

            "review": "Amazing! A must see for anyone in the Area.. We purchased our tickets for this excursion from a travel/tour agency onsite of our resort. Normally the price for this place is $100.00 US/person- however on the weekends (Saturday/Sunday) Rio Secreto has a special of buy one admission get the other 50% off- so for the two of us we paid about $154.00. If you don't like crowds than this is a great excursion as they promise groups no larger then 10 per tour guide- our group had 8 people in it- Groups were separated far enough that you never saw another group once in the caves - or at least we did not (at the time of check in there were 5 other groups). Rio Secreto provides all the equipment you need- even though their brouchure indicates you need to bring or rent your own water shoes- they actually provide them free of charge. Equipment that we had was in good conditions- though I did hear some complaints from other people at the resort that the water shoes they had weren't that great (i.e. falling apart). The best time to go is probably the morning tour as most of the equipment is dry -though there was still some wet items- my guess is that in the afternoon tour everything would be soaking wet and would have had no time to air out before being used again.When going into the underwater caves they tell you that you are not allowed to bring anything with you i.e. cameras, watches etc in order to help preserve the condition of the caves. The actual tour was fantastic and amazing. For much of the tour you spend walking through water from ankle to knee high deep- deeper into the cave though there are areas over 6 feet deep that you need to swim through- though you do have a life jacket on at all times. There are some areas that are extremely tight (this is why they recommend that this tour is not suited for anyone over 250lbs- though there was one person on the tour that must have been about 270lbs and he was able to get through the tight spaces. Note also that at the beginning of the tour they provide large walking sticks for those that need it- older persons in our group (60+) did use them and found them to assist with the walk. Both of us in our early 40s and healthy found no need for the walking stick- if you are fit then this excursion will pose no difficulties. This cave is the second largest cave in the world- with a cave in Kentucky US being the largest- but this cave is considered dead with no life and the one in Maya Riviera is considered alive. We did see some very small fish, one bat and a few very unusual spiders that share characteristics of the scorpion. This excursion was by far the best experience we had and we went to Tulum ruins, Xcaret Park and Xel-ha. In our opinion a must see.This excursion is also only about half a day: from your resort to the site and back. Some have commented on the food, but we did go to this excursion for the food- all I can say is that it was okay.I would give this place a 5/5 were it not for the ridiculous price they wanted for 1 photo- $25.00 US and $80.00 US for all photos- this is a rip off and was a bit of a disappointed at the end of the tour.......There is no reason why you can't take a camera in the underground cave except for the reason that they want to scam you by charging you a crazy price for pictures that they take of you. If you can get over this fact, than this should be a definite place to tour especially if you don't like large masses of people."

I was a bit apprehensive about spending a portion of the day underground instead of enjoying the Mexican sunshine. Nevertheless, I boarded the bus and headed to the cave. When we arrived, we were instructed to take everything off except for our bathing suits. We were given wet suits and water shoes. (well after taking a communal shower). After receiving an initial overview from our wonderful guide (Diana), we embarked on an amazing journey to a beautiful underground environment. Here are a few things to know: 1. TAKE THE STICK: When you are offered a walking stick before the journey; please take it. You will definitely need it and use it. 2. YOUR HAIR WILL GET WET (but it'll be so worth it) 3. ASK for DIANA to SERVE as YOUR GUIDE (As mentioned, she is wonderful as is the knowledge she provides. 4. TAKE the HAPPINESS route. The routes have different names; take the Happiness route 5. EAT the LUNCH and drink the hibiscus water (it's really good and you'll be quite hungry after the tour 6. BRING YOUR OWN WATER SHOES (with a great deal of support on the bottom). The shoes provided are a bit worn and the rocks inside and outside of the cave can wreck havoc on your feet. 7. HAVE FUN and ALWAYS SMILE PRETTY (the photographer is everywhere---it is possible to be cute in a cave)8. WEAR A BATHING SUIT 9. TAKE A CHANGE of CLOTHES"

We've been resisting the temptation TA reviewers have caused with their glowing accounts of Rio Secreto; we've experienced some serious disappointments in the past when we ate in a restaurant \"highly rated\" by TA reviewers or stayed at a hotel considered \"fantastic\" by them. We said \"the place received 4.5 stars, it has got to be at least interesting\" and went for it. After paying $1** per person on line and getting our payment codes, we drove to the entrance of Rio Secreto, almost directly across Xplore, on the Riviera Maya highway, south of Cancun, app. 75 minutes drive from the middle of the Hotel Zone. We got our bracelets and assigned to a group of seven others. Our group was driven in a minibus on an awful back country road 18 minutes. Upon arrival we were given a smelly wet suit, life jacket and ill fitting water shoes. Our jolly guide took us to the point where our misadventures were to begin: we descended on some uneven and steep steps to arrive at the beginning of the underground river system, which our guide claimed was 32 miles. He assured us that we were going to explore only 0.6 miles of it. We walked and occasionally had to swim in about 75 degrees F water. As we walked we had to focus entirely on where we were stepping and what was above our head. The floor is so uneven and there are so many little boulders or holes that a moment's negligence is enough to stumble and twist your ankle or scrape your skin (two people suffered these mishaps in our group.) So, except for the six occasions we were asked to stop and pose for our pictures to be taken by an accompanying photographer, we had no time and interest (because of fear of falling) to look around to examine all the formations nature built over millions of years. After the walk we were given lunch, which was characterized as \"gastronomic experience\" that consisted of some of the worst, I mean worst, Mexican food, we ever had - as I said earlier we go to Cancun often and spend there at least two months a year and know what is good, fair, and bad Mexican food. The trip to the parking lot was even worse as our mood had become quite bad. The bottom line is take very positive TA reviews with a grain of salt and if you are not a typical tourist who would be perfectly happy with a can of XX and any activity that would break the monotony of your beach days, but serious about nature, culture, and good food my advice is \"skip Rio Secreto!\" Any of the Mayan sites will offer a far more rewarding experience."

You can see the way they are trying to preserve the natural side of it and not make it too touristy. Def not overcrowded and small groups of 8-10 people. It was a great feeling walking in the cave and swimming in the natural underground water to get around. Our guide was very helpful and knowledgeable. We enjoyed every moment of it and despite it being a lot of money I feel it's worth it to help preserve it.It can be a bit commercial with the photo side of it and pics are pricy but I understand the need for preservation and we bought just the one.I liked the lunch included after but can be not to everyones taste as not a great variery.The 2 things I would suggest though are first of all there wasn't a lot of time to take in some of the magnificent sites down below as we had to keep up with the rest and didn't stop a lot. Maybe make the tour 2 hours long and get to take in some of the beauty of the place. Second of all, there are 3 different cave systems for the public and we only get to do one of them without being able to choose. I highly reocmmend having the option of the cave or maybe offering a package doing all 3 caves or 2 of the 3. All 3 have different things to offer.I would highly recommend this even if you're not too adventurous it's not too hard. Def a must see and perticularly if you are ingterested in natural preservation."

            "review": "A top highlight of my Caribbean cruise. An absolute blast on this adventurous excursion. After our ship docked in Cozumel many had shore excursions or activities right there. For many of us our trips were still a short ferry ride over to the Mexican mainland of Playa del Carmen. For those of us going to the Secret River we had a short drive into the jungle to get to our destination. After arriving we were greeted by very informative and helpful guides. And one note here for both men and women, leave modesty aside and be sure you wore a speedo for guys or a swimsuit for gals under your clothes since you first off need to strip down to those and take a quick outdoor freezing cold but quick shower. This is to keep the water clean of all oils, lotions, etc... There are separate changing and restroom areas for men and women and you have a private locker to store your valuables with your own key on a wrist bracelet. After this you are fitted into a wet-suit along with a skateboard/bicycle type helmet with a flashlight style light. You also get some water shoes to wear in case you don't have your own. After all that you are given another introduction about what you'll be seeing and we are all blessed in a ceremony by a medicine man. The entire walk from the main 'lodge' and changing area to the actual river entrance is about 15 minutes at most. The gripping ability of those water shoes is very important from here on out. Every group is limited to about ten people plus the main guide and the second guide usually brings up the real and also acts as the official photographer. Don't worry he gets pictures of everyone, and everything, even several one-on ones with you or your friend. Upon entering we are told to link hands and be turned to the same direction. The main guide will relay specific instructions which each relays to the next in line. For the river itself it is mostly only knee deep but in some instances you are told to push off and swim lightly and at one point to swim on your back. When walking you are told to take one step, plant it and then move your next foot. Not only for grip but also not to kick up the silt and make the water muddy. You are instructed not to touch the stalagmites/stalagmites or the sides so the off-and-on hand holding and slow procession helps maintain balance. You are constantly having to be aware of your footing as well as watching your head and back/shoulders due to low-hanging formations. At one point in a large room we all sat down in the water, turned-off our lights, and were silent for about two minutes. One of the most surreal out-of-body experiences I have ever felt. Absolute pitch blackness and silence. Throughout the guide points out the plant roots growing down as well some of the small sea life and, yeah spiders, that live here. The formations are mainly formed by mineral deposits (calcium and magnesium if I'm not mistaken) and the water is full of it. To demonstrate this, and also why we earlier had to take a shower, our guide held his flashlight under the water to illuminate it and then poked his finger in the water, and you could see the mineral deposits repel away, such as oil to water, or negative to positive. He then wiped his finger over his forehead and nose, re-dipped it, and the mineral deposits were like the first demonstration but on steroids. They were all gone instantly. Just goes to show they are serious about preserving the natural balance of this natural wonder. I believe the entire explored network is about 8 miles or so but our tour only includes about somewhat over a mile of it. We exit and hike back to the main lodge much the same way we came in. Upon exiting you change out of your 'explorer garb' and our group all meets and has a celebratory toast/shot, or two, of a local anise/licorice liquor. They have non-alcoholic available. You're taken to the photo/gift area where you can purchase what you want. For photos I believer it was $25 for one, about $75 for every photo, and somewhat like $125 for all the photos, a bottle of the liquor, and a souvenir shirt (they are nice). Then you are shown where lunch will be and you go to change back into your clothes and grab your stuff. Then you get a very nice local lunch with a lot to eat, you won't be hungry. You can then go back and pick up any pics you ordered, all downloaded onto your own CD and any other souvenirs before boarding your particular bus back to town.Now for an overview. I have been to beaches, and ruins, etc... before and I wanted something different I had never done before. This was certainly it. My description maybe sounded a bit scary of complicated. It is not. I saw people on groups which included children as well as older adults. Granted, you must have mobility and be somewhat agile, and not get claustrophobic, but almost anyone can do this. It is a bit of a workout, but not exhausting or strenuous. It almost reminded me of a corporate team-building event. When holding hands you are entrusting yourself to pretty much a complete stranger to give you guidance and help you get through it. Like I said both younger kids as well as older adults were as well. I myself have been through basic military training back in the day, and this was nothing like that. It was an absolute fun time where everyone helps everyone else enjoy the day. Bravo to all the people involved in making this the best offshore excursion of my Caribbean cruise."

            "review": "A unique and enjoyable experience. My wife and I visited Rio Secreto as part of an anniversary get-away, and we enjoyed the experience. Nowhere else have I seen a set of caves like these that are accessible to the general public. Here is what to expect:You arrive at a small parking lot off the highway. (It is well-marked and easy to drive to if you have a car, or you can pay more to have them pick you up at a hotel.) We waited about 15 minutes and watched a brief video about the caves before getting in vans for a 20 minute ride over bumpy dirt roads back to the cave area. There we took a cold shower (this is required to keep chemicals from sunscreen, deodorant, etc. from damaging the caves). Then they gave us lockers and gave us safety equipment (helmets, head lamps, wet suits, water shoes, walking sticks, and life jackets). The equipment was in okay but not excellent condition with holes in the water shoes (so if you have your own water shoes, you may want to bring them). Then we took a short walk with our guide and about 10 other people to the start of the cave exploration. The cave exploration consists of a combination of walking, swimming, and wading through a little more than 1 km of caves. The water was cool but not cold and the wet suits kept us warm. The hour or so that we spent in the caves was active but wasn't strenuous. (The guide said he had someone the week before who was 87 years old who managed to get through it, though he said she needed a lot of help.) The caves were beautiful -- truly stunning stalactite and stalagmite formations -- and the guide explained things along the way. (Definitely recommend using the walking sticks that they make available to you -- mine kept me from falling a couple times when wading through the caves.)After completing our pre-selected route through the cave, we returned our gear, dried off with towels that they provided, and got to see the pictures they had taken of us in the cave. (You could choose to buy the pictures or not.) Then they served us lunch. Food was decent and seemed to be reasonably authentic. After eating, we piled back in vans to return to the parking lot (others were returned directly to their hotels). All in all, we enjoyed the day and are glad that we included this in our itinerary. It takes most of a day to visit this attraction since it is a 1-1.5 hr drive to get there and takes a little under four hours at the site. If you drive, we would recommend visiting Tulum (35 minutes south of Rio Secreto and worth a quick stop if you have any interest in the Mayan civilization)."

A group of us did the tour at Rio Secreto which had been recommended by some friends back home\u2026 We saw so many great comments on Tripadvisor that we decided to book it. We booked beforehand online and we asked to have a specific guide Benito only because he came highly recommended by our friends. We ended up having a private tour (there was six of us) so that was awesome. Benito was very informative, professional and funny. He told us about the story of one of the land owner, how this system was found in 2006. Supposedly he saw an iguana which hid beneath rocks. Some rocks fell down and splashed in some water. Realizing that there might be an underground river, he decided to explore further with a team that mapped out the cave. Benito said that they use less than 10% of the entire system to minimize the impact on this fragile eco-system. If my memory serves me well, the length of the cave is 33 km long and 26 meter deep. If you are in Playa, you need to see Rio Secreto because the access and the beauty of this place is like watching Discovering Channel or National Geographic.Thanks Benito for sharing your love, passion and knowledge!"

The trek down into the cave was sometimes a feat if you have any mobility issues (or even if you don't), but they have walking sticks available to help steady yourself. The water is amazingly clear and the cave is a real experience. We really enjoyed the 1 minute of silent floating...not a single sound or light! But don't worry, you have a head lamp on with your own light source at all times. Our guide was amazing and hilarious - he made the tour lots of fun. Note that sunscreen or fly repellent of any kind are prohibited to preserve the quality of the water. Also, the gravel road from the main hwy to Rio Secreto is VERY bumpy and motion sickness was an issue for sure."

            "review": "Very interesting place to visit off the beaten path. We found this as an excursion on our cruise. We were ferried to Playa Del Carmen from Cozumel and then picked up in a van. We drove approximately 30 minutes to what seemed the middle of nowhere, down a bumpy road, but were told this was a \"Mayan Massage\" which made us laugh. Once we arrived we were greeted by our guide, whose name escapes me, but he was very personable and funny. We were taken to an area where restrooms were so you could change into your swimsuits, then taken to an area where a very primitive jungle like shower could be had. This was to remove as much of the oils from your skin so as not to disturb the natural ecosystem. We were then provided with water shoes, wet suits (an experience all their own if you've never put one on before) and head lamps. You are taken into the caves after walking down a jungle like trail to the area. The tours are done in small groups of about 10 which was perfect. We then entered the caves and began our walk through. The water was crystal clear, our guide was very informative throughout and was very concerned about everyone's safety. Our group worked together by alerting others to upcoming rocks, step downs and slopes. The caves are amazing to see. I feel that could be a little difficult for those with physical limitations and perhaps some who may be afraid of small spaces. There is some crouching down, some low ceilings, and swimming (doggie paddle) required as you go through. the final end of the tour requires some uphill climbing such as you would encounter on a hike in a wooded area. Tour lasts about an 1 1/2 hours. You are then provided with a meal which our consisted of Broth to which you could add chicken and rice, beans, veggies, etc. Very delicious. Overall a great experience that you should enjoy. I wish the pictures were less costly at the end. We only purchased one photo $25 or we could have purchased that entire tour for $89. We did not wish to spend that amount of money and truly wish they would have been more in the range of $50 for all of the pictures since they are downloaded onto a disc."

If you have done caving before then this is probably not the tour for you - it is targeted at the uninitiated and general tourist - that said it is still fun. The company have set the whole experience up very well, with the different groups going off on different routes to give a feeling of being an explorer in a remote environment. The wetsuits, helmet and lights are in good condition - just don't be sucked into buying the $10 booties - they are part of the tour price and will be given to you to use when you get to the actual point of departure. Of course if you are worried about wearing booties that someone else has already worn then go ahead and buy them! The lunch at the end of the tour is satisfying and hits the spot. The tour guides are friendly, knowledgable and you are put in a group with a guide who speaks your language (english, spanish, french). Good experience and one that most could do."

The transportation our resort was comfortable and the driver Trino was delightful and informative during our transit to Rio Secreto.

After a quick shower to rinse off we moved through getting our water shoes, wet suit and safety helmet. The water in the caves is chilly 72 degrees F so take the wet suit!!!Off to the cave after a quick safety briefing, prior to entry we were treated by a Mayan Shaman to be blessed. The cave was wondrous and a must see! There are three routes in the cave system we went to the Palace and I hear tell that Supremo route is even more beautiful. There in no photography allowed by the tourist in the caves. The do have a photographer assigned to the group and of course the photos are available for a modest fee. We were served a lunch after we had changed into our dry clothes, recommend that you bring a change of clothes. After lunch we were brought back to the check in area to meet up with our transportation back to the resort. So in a nutshell we'd go back to check out one of the other routes!"

I think anyone from singles to families will have a great time on this tour. I pre-booked this tour online via Princess Cruises about a month before my sailing. Everything was arranged so that all I had to do was meet at the designated time on the ship and meet my fellow thrill seekers. After the 30 min ride over to Playa del Carmen from our Cozumel port, it was about another 30 min ride to the Secret River. Once there, we were fitted with wet suits, swimming shoes, and hard hat and flashlight. they have lockers for secure storage and this is included in your tour cost.After a short walk to the entrance of the cave, we enter and immediately begin to see the beauty of the Rio Secreto. Stalagmite and stalactite formations in all directions. Our guide pointing out blind shrimp and fish. We move along and the water gets deeper. You quickly realize why we have to swim in some parts. It gets deep and you can just float over to where you are going with a little steerage. Surprisingly the water is not cold..I think the wet suit helps. There is a lot of calcium in the water which is cool and the water is extremely clean.We reach one point and everyone sits in a designated spot. Our guide says ok, everyone turn off your lights. It was completely peaceful and serene...and totally pitch black. Lights back on and we head on for a bit more.The entire time spent in the cave was about an hr and a half. And it was totally worth it. After we got out of our wetsuits and dried off, we were treated to include lunch prepared on site. Amazing food. Great people.You have ample time to buy photos of your time in the cave or lay in one of the hammocks, as I did. After the ride back to Carmen we had time to do some shopping before catching our ferry back to Cozumel to the ship.Definitely book this excursion if you haven't before. I would even venture to say that anyone with slight claustrophobia should be okay on this tour as I did not get a sense of that. The cave is pretty wide and the lights help.You will not be disappointed. This reminded me of fun times with my dad and family back in my childhood when we would do this in the USA."

We washed off in a cold shower, put on wet suits, life jackets, and a helmet with a light and walked through the jungle for 5 minutes to the ceynotes entrance. It was stunning! The water was \"refreshing\" (cold at first) but you got used to it. The caves were beautiful, and we got to see some special cave fish, shrimp, and some bats. At the beginning during our walk through the jungle, we got to participate in some Mayan respect ceremony. It could have been alright, but it was really awkward and phony feeling. I would recommend getting rid of this piece and just sharing about the ritual.Raful was very enthusiastic and informative. You could tell he cared about the cave and the story behind it. He also did a great job on keeping an eye on all the participants, making sure we were all safe and comfortable.The 4 stars is because of the pictures. You can NOT take your own camera into the cave (which we knew before) and is smart because you need your hands free. We had to pause many times for the camera guys to take our pictures, which was fine, but turned annoying. We had planned on purchasing a picture since we couldn't take any, but once we got out, we learned that ONE picture cost $25, and then the packages got larger and more expensive. We didn't think it was worth that much. For all the stops ad picture taking, there were only about 10 pictures of us at the end, and maybe only 3 we actually liked.Afterwards, Raful and our group stopped to take a shot of their version of tequila. They provided water for those that don't drink. We then had a lunch together, which was yummy. They had a hibiscus tea, chicken tortilla soup, stew chicken and potatoes, and many other sides to try! It was buffet style so you could help yourself.This excursion takes almost the whole time you are in port, but afterwards, we got to spend about 30 minutes in Playa del Carmen before catching the ferry back to Cozumel. We enjoyed looking around the places there and finding good deals.The experience is irreplaceable and we couldn't find anything else like it elsewhere! All other cave tours were just tubing and less interactive and adventurous."

He clearly enjoys what he does and took the time to explain how the caves formed, were discovered, and so on.Of note - During the tour we were accompanied by a photographer who captured photos along the way. I know some people don't like this sort of thing and and think it is a rip-off but we really appreciated this.

Sometimes the water will be up to your ankles and sometimes it'll be deeper. Also, once the group is in the cave, there's no way back (there's only one guide per group), so if you get tired easily, or you don't like darkness or you're a bit claustrophobic, do yourself a favor and book another activity.The caves are very very beautiful and the guides do a good job in teaching you how stalactites and stalagmites are formed and how to protect them... and if you're familiar with the Mayan mythology, you just can't help thinking how close to the Xibalba you are.At the end of the tour they pamper you with a shot of a Mayan liquor and a nice buffet style meal- I highly recommend the tamales : )"

Once at the tour location, we were formed into small groups of 10 based on language (French, Spanish, English). They then transported you through the jungle on a VERY bumpy ride to the site where they provided wet suits, vests, water shoes and helmets with lights. They also give you a locker to store your items you will not be bringing. You cannot wear any perfume, lotions, sprays etc so they make you take a quick very cold shower. Everything is in Shade or inside so you do not need sunscreen. You also cannot wear any jewelry (prescription glasses are okay) and cannot bring cameras, not even waterproof ones, as they need to preserve the area and all these items can damage the natural area, not to mention some of the river water feeds into the drinking water of the Mexican natives. There are 3 paths to the river so each of our groups went to separate locations. We only ran into one small group once. This also means if we go back, we can ask for a different path, making it a new experience. (and we will go back). There is a photographer that follows your group taking many, not so skilled, photos that you can purchase at the end. As a photographer my self, I was not too happy with the photos we were presented, but i can understand why they do not want you taking your camera in. On the tour we had use of walking sticks that I needed as I am short and this greatly helped the hiking though the caverns. There was some swimming and walking through water as well. You had to pay close attention as to not get hurt/fall. The guide told us exactly where to step and what to look out for. She gave us history and science behind the river/caves and formations. We experienced complete darkness for a minute when they had us stand in a specific location and turn off all our lights. Something you think you have done, but trust me, you haven't. The walking through the caves lasted a little less than 1.5 hrs. At the end we were provided a small towel, and changed into dry clothes. I recommend bringing a change of clothes because afterwards were provided a lunch buffet in a lunch hall area. It consisted of local foods (fruit, rice, beans, cactus, soups, salads, etc.) as well as a shot (or two) of the local Mayan liquor which is a fermented honey, but more like a Sambuca than a Mead. There was beer and other snacks available for purchase as well, but they are not needed. We purchased the CD of Photos that you can view before buying. For $89 it contained all the photos of us, group photos, about 50 \"stock\" photos of the cave/jungle/animals that are gorgeous and we negotiated in a bottle of the liquor. Otherwise it was $25 for one photo or a package for $109 that included a shirt and hat.This is an amazing experience and I highly recommend it."

After suiting up we walked a bit through the jungle to a site where they preformed a Mayan ritual before heading in. What laid before us was breathtaking to say the least. After walking the river and swimming in the pools we climbed out to enjoy a very nice luncheon. The only negative in the entire trip was the fact that they do not allow camera's at all and the cost of their pictures is ridiculous!!! Not one person in our group purchased a single picture because of the cost! So here we had this wonderful experience and nothing to remember it by."

            "review": "Rocky Road Ahead. The Rio Secreto experience was different than other cenotes we visited in that the majority of the tour was walking with very little swimming. The price was $75 US per person and the group sizes were large and you waited on site until ten guests had paid to form a group. The guide was knowledgeable, the equipment provided was top quality and included a towel to dry with, but we found that the water was not as crystal clear as many of the other cenotes we visited and so it was difficult to walk as you could not see where you were going, even with the head lamp provided. We did not see many fish, but the guide did point out a large spider and we definitely appreciated the Mayan blessing ceremony that preceded our entry to the cave. My recommendations would be: be prepared for a long van ride to the site, arrive early as by noon there were lots of people, possibly bring your camera as far as the lockers where you get equipment, be prepared for a lot of stopping for photo shoots and a long walk through the jungle to access the cave. I felt that the photographer took away from the sanctity of the experience and would recommend asking for a smaller group size and no photographer if we were to visit the site again. In comparison to the other attractions at Tulum, including several cenote visits, this one was the least value for our money."

They supplied us with water shoes, wet suits , life jackets and helmets, wish I had my own wet suit and shoes. Carlos our tour guide was an awesome young man with a world of info as he led us down into the caves and river. It's an amazing site to see.with rock formations millions of years old, crystal clear waters and trees that send roots down 90 ft to tap into this water source. They also let us connect with some Mayan culture,before and during tour. There are some tight spots to walk around and down , but safety was first for Carlos . The headlamps and flashlights of both Carlos an d the photographer created some awe inspiring moments . Photographer follows you the while tour and takes some awesome pictures ( $109.00 us for about 70 pictures on flash drive, or a group one for $25). They have 4 different caves to visit so you can return and have a whole new experience . We had a shot of a Mayan drink after and then lunch(it was just ok). Great day for 129.00"

Took the Colectivos there from the Grand Bahia Principe and it took about 30 minutes and cost $3.50 USD each (+$79 USD entry fee which includes the wetsuit, head geer with headlamp, wet shoes, flotation vest and meal at the end), rather than a $109USD, so we saved about $23 each..so up to you but really but easy to do and very safe. We were only about 6 in our tour and our guide was Diana and she was amazing, a lot of fun and so energetic and was able to answer all questions we had. We had a lot of fun. The caverns are very beautiful, it is an experience to live in itself and am unable to put what was felt in writing but we highly recommend it. We got to swim quite a ways also but even if you cannot swim not a problem as the flotation device will assist you. The only negative point are the costs for the pictures which was $25 for only one (REALLY) and $79 for 19, this is a scam in my opinion as they refuse you bring your own camera. Although they claim it is not theirs...YEAH right. So, we did not buy one. Still recommend the tour w/o pics :-)"

We had a guide named Benito and he navigated us through the system with humour and a constant flow of information \u2013 what a teacher! And a very passionate guide. He encouraged two young kids, who did not want to do the tour, to at least try it. Let me tell you; by the end of the tour they were raving about the awesomeness of what they had seen! This was my first time ever visiting a cave and it left me in Awe\u2026We were at 20 meters underground, walking and swimming in pure, crystal-clear water so clear that the water is blue and the bottom extremely white. Surrounded by thousands and thousands of geological formations such as stalactites and stalagmites etc.My awe-inspiring moment came during the silence. At one point during the tour, Benito made us sit in a circle and shut off our lights. We remained in silence and in complete darkness for a few minutes. In this all-encompassing darkness, where we disconnected from the outside world, I felt an intense connection with Mother Nature\u2019s womb. Words cannot express what I felt, the connectedness with all that was present within me and around me. This was a very inspiring experience, one I will never forget! Useful info: I brought my own water shoes and wetsuit. They do offer shoes and a wetsuit but I was glad to have my own as some people in our group complained about the smell of their wetsuit and that some water shoes had holes in them.You can buy water shoes at Rio Secreto for 10$ (US)Xtabentun: you can taste this local liquor of Honey and Anise once you finish the tour\u2026 its delightful!ENJOY!!!"

It included a ritual to the Mayans asking permission to enter onto their land. After that our guide Julio lead us underground to a river cave where he explained everything we saw in great and knowledgeable detail. The water was crystal pure and the formations beautiful. Every effort is made to maintain it in it`s natural state so you are asked to shower before you enter and not to touch anything while in the cave unless instructed by your guide. Following the tour you stop at a pavilion for a shot of a Mexican liqueur that had an Anise flavor with your guide .After you are changed back into your clothes, you go to another pavilion and have a delicious meal with your guide. The whole experience was just fantastic and I can`t imagine not seeing it if you had the opportunity."

Our guide was Alfredo and it was obvious that he was totally enthralled with what he was doing. We wore swim suits, and were given the option of wearing wetsuits (which i recommend), a helmet with light and a life jacket. There are multiple paths in the cavern so each group is kept to about a dozen, and we did not see any other group during our tour. It is a very neat expierence. For the most part the water was not so deep as to require swimming but we had a couple places that were over our head, but the life jackets make it such that you do not need to know how to swim. The path we were on was flat but uneven, so if walking is an issue this won't work well. We were in the cave about an hour then had lunch. Alfredo warned me that the green salsa 'is pure hell\" pure habeneros. It was pretty hot.To sum up, if you enjoy visiting caves, this excursion is worth the effort."

Just a few minutes south of Playa Del Carmen, Rio Secreto is a fairly new attraction and only discovered within the last 10 years. It is an underground cavern with areas filled with fresh water. The entire tour is very well organized. You arrive and fill out paper work, watch a short video presented in English, Spanish and French and then are given all the required gear (wet suit, aqua shoes, life vest and lighted helmet). They provide lockers for your personal items and towels. The groups are small to protect the area from damage. Each group has a guide, who is knowledgeable about the cave, Mayan history and about efforts to protect these geological formations from being destroyed. Our tour guide was \u201cRo\u201d. He was a delight and very knowledgeable. His enthusiasm was contagious. You start off with a \u201cdry walk\u201d thru an area and end within a seated space and a light show on the cave walls telling the history of mankind. Then we went and had a great breakfast, but I think if you are an afternoon group you will get lunch. After this, we were given our gear and then off to the cave where there was water. You have some areas with dry ground, some with a little water and other areas where you swim thru deep water. The brochures do show a good representation of what you will go thru. Along the way there is a photographer taking photos, which you can purchase at the end. I have seen many things in Mexico, both above and below ground and this by far was spectacular in a way I will never forget. I strongly encourage any able bodied (you need to be steady on your feet) person to see this. It has taken millions (I think) of years to create this world wonder and it would be a shame to miss it. The group who discovered and created this as a tourist spot has done and is doing a great job at preserving it. They are a very conscientious group with the sole purpose of preserving the local flora and fauna and various environment programs to protect this unique place on earth. It was kind of expensive but when you consider that there is no other place like this then it becomes a priceless experience. I know you will agree."

They will set you up with a locker, wet suit,shoes and jacket. You take a quick shower to remove soap and oils from your body. Alex our guide took us through the caves and was very informative. It is a special kind of tour, You hike and swim in this tour. If you have difficulty walking on uneven surfaces this tour may not be for you. After the cave tour you hike back and check out the pictures the photographer has taken. They provided a delicious Mayan styled lunch."

We are not \"caving people\" and this is definitely the only way we'd ever see anything like this. The excursion takes all day, except for 45 min or so of shopping time in a relatively nice area just before returning to Cozumel. First we traveled on a boat with 200 other cruisers to Playa Del Carmen from Cozumel. Then we walked 3-4 blocks, where two groups of 7 of us got into a small van / bus and drove 10 min on the highway followed by 15 min on rough, bumpy, rocky roads leading into the jungle. I became seasick on the boat ride, the bus was not bad, just bumpy, they called it a \"Mayan massage.\" Once we arrived, we were met by our guide (Luis) and issued wet suits (short legs, long sleeves), helmets with lights, and water shoes and a walking stick. If you have your own water shoes you may wear them, and the walking stick is optional. I think the stick would have been cumbersome but I am relatively fit and preferred to have my hands free. Then everyone was STRONGLY encouraged to visit the bathroom, as it would be 2 hours before you see another one and it's not good for the features in the cave and the river if you pee in it. Next we had to step under a (cool / cold) shower to wash off body oils, deodorant (skip it, don't even apply it that morning), any chemicals. I wore make-up on my face, my head didn't go under water and Luis didn't insist I wash it off. [One could even skip sunscreen, sit indoors on the boat, middle seat on the bus, then it's mostly shady at the site, then you go underground.] Part of the time in the cave you're in ankle or knee deep water, then there are short times where you float and \"dog paddle\" yourself through the spaces. Luis was careful to point out sharp projections in the rock formations where you might get cut. A photographer goes with you as no tourist cameras are allowed, plus it's relatively dark without the helmet lights. The photographer takes plenty of pictures of the group throughout the tour, then you can purchase photos after the tour. I heard someone say they bought one for $25, another paid $79 for 2 complete \"sets\" of shots. After the tour (approx. 1.5 hours) you get a \"snack\" which is indeed a large meal of authentic Mexican food. Then you travel with the group back to the port area in Playa Del Carmen, where we had 45 min to shop before boarding the small boat back to Cozumel. Upon arrival in Cozumel we were told to go straight to the ship, no time for shopping, though you do have to walk through a long duty-free shop to get there.All you need to bring with you is your ship card and ID to get on / off the ship, money for shopping, and a change of dry clothes. They give you a locker key (hubby wore it around his neck) where we put our personal belongings, they give you a small towel afterward. I didn't bring clothes and wished I had, I was still somewhat wet when I got back to the ship. Luis was great, full of information about the nature we were seeing and how the river affects and is affected by the local environment, and how to best navigate through the cave and the water. The whole experience was worth the price, I'd recommend it to anyone."

What an amazing experience to walk and swim in this cave system with all these stalactites and stalagmites, crystal clear waters and pure peacefulness. Our guide Rafful did a great job. He was very knowledgeable and and was patient with us slower ones. I'm a heavy woman and needed help sometimes getting up or down steeper areas and was slower when the bottom of the river was uneven or couldn't see it. I was grateful for small breaks for explanations or pictures where I could relax a moment. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this for those with real problems walking or with balance. They really made our group ( of 7) feel like a family. There are lockers, wet suits, helmets and life jackets provided at no cost. We brought our own water shoes, but I think there was a $10US fee to buy some. You had to remove absolutely everything else except prescription glasses before entering the river (all jewelry, no cameras). The lunch provided was ok. The photographer took many beautiful photos. You get to go see them before lunch and decide if you'd like to purchase them. I bought a thumb drive (or you can get a disk) for $80US. Very expensive!! But, I really wanted something to remember this by. There's about 30 photos of our group with about 12 of them of me and my husband, plus an added 15 or so stock photos of the caves and animals/fish in the caves. You had the option to purchase one photo for $20US or a package with the CD, an album and a T-shirt for $130US."

I had specifically ask for BENITO as a guide as I thought not only was he a wonderful guide but he was also very attentive to all. He treated my mother-in-law like she was his own mother. She had much difficulty walking and he personally made sure that she was well taken care of. Also one of my kids was kind of afraid of the water so he also walked behind BENITO. We absolutely recommend this activity for all the family and although this was my 2nd time around- I enjoyed it as much as the first time, if not more! Thanks for all Benito and we shall return next year probably to try out the third route.CHEERS to all your team!"

Sure enough, it was unlike anything that we've ever done or seen. First off, a reminder to everyone.... DON'T BOTHER bringing a camera because they are NOT allowed. This was a bummer for us because we brought our GoPro with us with the intention of capturing some really fascinating displays of nature. The cave, the underground river, the stalactites, stalagmites were all so interesting. They were all a marvel to behold. Our guide made it more fascinating with his humor and anecdotes. At one point, he had us all turn our headlights off and we were in complete and utter darkness that we couldn't even see our hands in front of us. Very surreal. For non swimmers, don't fret because everyone gets a life jacket whether you want to or not. Most of the 1 kilometer or so of the tour was walking on uneven surfaces and the actual swimming.... well, floating really as the life jacket just makes you float to the surface, was very minimal. All the same, it was a great experience. The actual time in the cave was about an hour and a half but the total time of the experience (lunch, changing into wetsuits, etc) was about 3 hours or so.Though not spectacular, the lunch provided was good and adequate. Of course because a camera wasn't allowed, you have to buy the photos that they take of you during the tour if you want souvenirs from the experience. Kinda pricey but you have no choice.I highly recommend this tour as it is very active and captivating."

CON: the only con was that we got a really bad tour guide. However, this one thing ruined our entire experience. Benito was bossy, even to the other employees. He snapped his fingers at them and shushed them during the introduction in front of the customers. He could have asked them nicely.I have a different religion, so although I respected their intro prayer, and stood there politely, I didn\u2019t repeat the first part of the prayer. I saw Benito glance at me and give me a scolding look. It was annoying and i felt like i was on a field trip as an elementary student.I was the last one to get a helmet and wetsuit, which was fine, but this means that i would be finished last putting it on, since I was given one when the others already wore theirs. However, even though he knew this, he told me that i had to hurry up. I HAD JUST received this wetsuit in my hand and he told me to hurry.I could honestly tell you that it was a very doable experience, and that it would not have made any time difference (in minutes) EVEN IF i had taken my time and went slowly at my own pace. he was rushing us because he felt he had to be on time. but i think this is just his personality. it wasn\u2019t that difficult and everyone could still have finished on time even at our own pace. HOWEVER, because he was scolding us each minute, we felt stressed, rushed, and was prone to falling more because of the rushing. Benito kept telling the people in front of me to \u201ckeep up \u201c and pulling them aside and shaming them by saying \u201cif you don\u2019t keep up, it will be a problem.\u201dHonestly, after finishing the adventure, there would not have been any problems even if we had gone at a slow pace. It is not a long route and we would have had Plenty of time. The same tour with the same customers could still have finished in the same amount of time AND enjoyed the experience, if it was with a DIFFERENT tour guide. it was not scary and it would have been so much more enjoyable if we were not scolded during the whole trip. I was jealous when I saw other tour guides smiling and laughing with their group. UGH what a waste of money and beauty. Overall, i recommend this, but just not with this tour guide."

This place is a well-oiled machine, we never felt like we were waiting for someone, there was no idle time.Cons:- If you take a ferry in from Cozumel, be prepared for a very bumpy, nauseating 40-min ride. They said our trip was worse than usual and handed out barf bags \"just in case.\" A few passengers made use of them but thankfully, the return trip was much more manageable.- The photos were terrible! They forbid guests to take cameras on to the tour (which I support) and had a dedicated photographer take photos of our group. We were let down when we saw the results: out-of-focused, blurry images that looked horrible. It was a disappointing end to an otherwise wonderful experience.Note: This excursion is not for everyone as it requires a moderate level of physical movement. There are a couple parts of the trail that are small and require crouching down and squeezing through small spaces."

The underground caves are absolutely stunning. It was completely unique from anything I had experienced. Our guide, Dianna was very informative. I found it interesting that the caves were only recently discovered in 2008. I recommend that if you have any mobility issues that you use the walking sticks provided. Uneven ground and low light could pose problems for some. It was a little dissapointing that you can't bring a camera though..."

            "review": "Fantastic Experience. We booked the excursion through our travel advisor in our resort. The booking process was fast and efficient. Unfortunately, the driver was almost 30 minutes late to pick us up. Once we finally arrived at the parking area, we had to hop on another van to the actual site 7 km away. Because we were late we had to miss the introductory video. We were quickly issued wetsuits and helmets with lights, and were offered beach shoes, but we had brought our own. Our guide Pablo took over and provided probably the most enjoyable 90 minute experience I have ever had. We started with a Mayan blessing to get permission from the Mayan Gods to enter, and then descended into the Mayan underworld. There was a lot of walking, mostly through water, and several spots where we swam in water that was anywhere from 3-10 metres deep. We turned off our headlamps at one point and got to experience the amazing quiet and total darkness of the cave. The only lighting in the caves is headlamps. We were in a group of 9 - 10 is the usual limit. My only issue was when I was bringing up the rear and couldn't see the cave floor because of the silt that the others had stirred up, and manage to fall twice, scraping both shins and a knee fairly impressively. They gave me first aid at the end, so no big deal. The food was pretty good. The facility, for being a fair distance inland on \"interesting\" roads was very well maintained, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Note - if you are 6'4\" like I am, you may find the low ceilings in some spots a bit challenging. Thank God for helmets! The only downside was that a CD of all the photos (about 15 or so) was $69 USD. Individual photos were $20 or $25 each, so we boought the CD. For some reason, people that were not in Pablo's group had to pay more. I highly recommend this experience and would do it again in a heartbeat."

TL;DR version:Awesome place, good equipment, no time wasted on waiting for anything, acceptable food, pricey photos, fun for everyone.Longer version:We were staying in Playa del Carmen, and on our first day we couldn't be bothered to drive to Tulum, or Coba ruins. But we thought that spending some time in a cave system would be fun. And it was.It's a close drive from Playa to the start point, where they gather people into 10-11 persons groups. Then it's a 10-20min drive through the jungle/forest. You get a wet-suit, a life vest, a helmet with a headlamp, and a walking stick. You can store your belongings in the free locker provided. Make sure the wet-suit is tight. They give you one that might fit, and it did work fine for the most of our group. But my wife had to ask for a smaller one, and we suggested to another girl in our team to do the same. Poorly fitted wet-suit will NOT keep you warm. The headlamps can't be adjusted, i.e. you can't adjust the angle otherwise than by moving your helmet up and down. If you ever had a Petzel headlamp, you will definitely feel the pain of using an nonadjustable lamp.The cave-walk takes about an hour. And there's a short swim involved. The life vest together with the wet-suit will keep you afloat. One person from our party can't swim, but was ok with us dragging her around in the water. So: swimming capabilities are not a must.You can't take any light and photo equipment, but there's a photographer following you around. The photos are ca. $20 a piece, or $75 for a set of perhaps 10 (on a cd, with some extra stuff). Might make sense if you're a bigger group. We looked stupid on the photos, so decided against it.After the cave part there is a buffet lunch (but first showers and changing back to your clothes), with some vegetarian options. Not mind blowing, but also not disappointing. After lunch we even had some time to swing in the hammocks. Then a bus right back to the meeting point, and it's over.Our guide was well informed, and quite nice, but nothing special. But she did make sure we don't waste any time, be it taking photos, or changing into the wet-suits, etc.All in all: excellent way to spend our time. Our non-swimming friend, and a 3 months pregnant lady did not complain, and in fact loved it. It might be a bit physically demanding for some, but unless you have a cast on your leg and have to use crutches, you'll be fine."

You are given a walking stick to help keep your balance for the wet and dry part of the tour. My guide Irina was very helpful and knowledgeable.

We took this tour as we didn't want a all day thing, with ziplining and a million other things in it like all the other tours are around this area. We wanted to take our three and four year old boys who Quad at home. This was a good trip for them. Likely a bit boring for a experienced trail rider, but good for families and kids. The boys sat in front of us and we never went above 20miles in the ride so It was a good pace for them. The cave swim was great, but I wish there was more time spent there, we would like a tour that took you there for a hour or more and maybe had a light picnic or something included. The end of the ride I think all travelers were hungry but the kiosk only has pop. No snacks, chips etc to buy. I think there is a missed opportunity there for sure, for them to create more revenue. The pictures they take are a good price for the disk, $100 I recall. Also they don't allow bags or backpacks on the trail or sunscreen, for safety of the water but we were not told when we booked - so just be aware :)"

We docked in Cozumel, so we had to take a ferry across to the mainland, which was fine, but took about 40 minutes. Once on the mainland, we were met by representatives and taken to the nature reserve in a van. Once at the Rio Secreto site, we were given wet suits, helmets, water shoes if you didn't bring your own, head lamps and walking sticks (take a stick - they are helpful to keep your balance). There are lockers there to lock up your stuff. You are not allowed to take cameras of any sort - a photographer comes with you and then you can purchase the pictures on a CD at the end of the trip. We walk out on a root covered trail to the site of a Mayan who blesses us and does the smudging. Then we entered the cave - we were walking through many parts of it - knee deep, waist deep etc., but parts were quite deep and we had to swim. There was one part where we had to jump off a ledge into the deep water - very cool. We explored the caves for quite a while and learned about the geology and the history of the area. Our guide was very good. Towels were provided and outside showers too if you wanted once you came out of the caves. Afterwards, we all had a shot of something that tasted like sambuca to celebrate that we made it out unscathed! Lunch was provided - rice and beans and tortillas and fruit etc. It was okay. After lunch, we were able to literally hang out in some hammocks while we waited for our van to arrive. I bought the CD of pictures. They wanted to sell it to me for $79 but I talked him down to $55, so do not pay full price. The pictures are fantastic though - see one attached. We were driven back but then had almost an hour to hang out and/or shop before the ferry came. Not the best shopping here - I enjoyed it much more on Cozumel - but there was a free beach you could hang out on until your ferry time. Your guide will provide you with the ferry ticket and walk you to the front of the line. Well done. Highly recommended if you are physically able..."

We arrived at Rio Secreto after about a 15-minute ($150 peso) cab ride from Playa del Carmen. We arrived a little early, and were invited to relax in comfortable chairs outside until the presentation began. The tour starts with a recorded overview presentation, then there is a short hike over land to get to the cave. We were in a small group of 6, along with our guide, plus a guide in training, and the photographer. Unlike cave tours that follow a paved walkway at major caves in the US, here you'll don a wet suit, a life vest, and cave helmet with a light. The gear was in good condition and in a broad size range (we are 2X and 3X, and had suits that fit comfortably). The floor of the cave is covered in water, and it is often quite uneven. Note that if you have any foot problems or balance problems, the tour might be difficult for you. The tour was mostly walking and occasionally swimming a short distance, although our guide told us this can vary by year and season. Our group chose to join hands in a line to steady ourselves, and that was very helpful in traversing the uneven floor. Walking sticks are also provided as an option, but I\u2019m glad we chose the hand-holding option. Our guide, Nunes, did a fantastic job of helping us to navigate through the cave, stepping, high and low, over rocks, and under formations. We opted to buy the photograph package, both because the pictures were very good and to support the organization. I\u2019m very happy we made that decision; we love the pictures and shared them with family and friends. Although some have said the water was cold, we found it more refreshing than cold. (We're from Wisconsin, so that may have something to do with it.) I would definitely recommend this tour."

            "review": "Amazing place but it was a lot of work to experience. This was an expensive, once in a lifetime experience but I can\u2019t give it 5 stars. It was a harrowing drive from the hotel to the site where we waited for the shuttle down a 5K bumpy road to the river. The check in process was smooth, we were issued wet suits complete with a scorpion, rubber shoes, etc. We were introduced to our guide Raul who was excellent. He was knowledgable, fun and kept the tour rolling nicely. There were 12 of us in our group and despite the huge number of tour groups we didn\u2019t see anyone else on our tour. The caverns were amazing but this was not an easy walkabout. I was beat by the end of the tour. Even the kids were tired. The surface was very uneven with many opportunities for a sprained ankle. The tour lasted about an hour but when they came to sell us the photographs we got pissed and disappointed. They wanted $83 for a set or $25 per photo. This was ludicrous considering their costs. What was more annoying was that the photos were quite good and would be a memorable item. No matter how good they were I was not going to be ripped off. They offered a traditional \u201cgastronomical\u201d meal which was included in the price and quite enjoyable. We then spent another 1-1/2 waiting for buses back to the staging area and back to the hotel. This was a very cool experience so if you can deal with the cost, an entire day of your vacation then I recommend you do it."

The more you walk and swim in these cavers the more you are impressed. The guides (ours was Alina) know their subjects inside out and you can feel their passion about it. The physical challenge is light (I consider myself in good shape) and just enough to wake you up from these days at the beach doing nothing! After this marvellous experience, a light lunch was served (basic ... but enough to sustain until you go back to the ship). Obviously and as usual the pictures are a catch ... after asking for 79$ for all of them, the photographer tells you that he could do \"a special price for you\" at 60$ ... so negotiate and ... you know: these pics worth the memories they will bring back to you!Great experience that I recommend"

Everything was very well organized and even my 6 yrs old daughter was able to experience the tour and have a ton of fun! The guides are very knowledgeable, patient with kids and have a great sense of humor. This was definitely one of the highlights of our trip!You will get all the equipment you need at Rio Secreto and it is all included in your admission - wet suits, life-jackets, water shoes, helmet / head-lamps etc. No need to buy anything. There is also no need for you to know how to swim, our daughter doesn't swim and was able to just float along holding lightly into my husband. However, this is still an underground experience, so if your kid is uncomfortable with closed spaces, darkness, water in general, I wouldn't advise you to try it. Our kid is a pirate at heart and an explorer so she had no issues but I can see it being scary for some kids. The lunch after the tour is pretty good and there are options to all tastes. We scored a wonderful deal through one of those touristic information booths in Playa del Carmen so we ended up paying just a third of the price for all our group, but even if we had paid in full it would be well worth it!The only thing not included are the photos they offer you ate the end, a professional photographer goes with your group and takes pics all the way which they sell to you in a CD for $79 - kind of expensive, but the pics are great and you can't just not buy it."

The guide was very knowledgeable and filled you with confidence. Very well organised, interesting and a fantastic experience. The food was also pretty good. The only disappointing part was the charade of trying to sell you overpriced photos of your tour at the end. They start off trying to sell you a CD for something like US$60 and then try the hard sell and tell you shhh don't tell anyone else but you can have the CD for US$45 etc etc and they won't go any lower than this. Such a shame because I would have loved to have photos and if it had been a sensible price like US$10 or US$15 I would have bought it, but it was essentially a scam which otherwise ruined a fantastic experience. The managers need to sort this out and sell photos at a more reasonable price in a less pushy way. Maybe even include photos in the ticket price and just charge $10 more for entry? None of our group purchased the overpriced pictures, which is a shame, as I would have liked them, but we didn't appreciate the attempt to rip us off."

            "review": "Great caving adventure!. I thought this would be a float trip in a cenote river, but this is a hike and swim! The cave was discovered by the current land owner in 2006 and was opened to the public in 2008. It is well developed and thought out. There are nice, clean bathroom facilities. There are wetsuits, swim shoes, helmets, head lamps, and life vests that are mandatory and are needed. There are lockers and nothing, including watches and earrings are to be taken into the cave. You can't bring your cameras, even if they are waterproof so if you want photos, you have to buy them. It would be very hard to carry a camera due to the uneven ground and water level. Depending upon rain and season, the water in the cave can be throat high. They require everyone to shower before putting on wetsuits to remove any lotions or suntan lotions that would pollute the water. The shower water is from the cenote and the water is cold-around 65 degrees F. Although the tour was about an hour, we were really cold and happy to get out of the water at the end. We were glad our tour was the last one of the day; 500 people had been through that day, twice as many as usual, probably because we were there on 12/31. Our group was small and we didn't see anyone else in the cave so it was an intimate experience. After a brief presentation, we load up in a van for a bumpy 7km ride to the cave opening. A Mayan priest gives a blessing and prayer to the spirit Gods to protect people who enter the caves. This was a respectful brief ceremony in Mayan language. There is a brief walk down into the cave and then we had to swim into the cave. The manager who has the wetsuits decides which of the 3 routes your group will take. Of the miles of cavern, only 10% are open in order to try to preserve the ecosystem. The ground, which is submerged rock formations, is very uneven, sharp, and varying in slickness and depth. The mandatory wet shoes are very much needed. There are walking sticks available with the wetsuits. I was often crouching to feel rocks and drop off areas. The area is dark except for the guide's flashlight and our helmet headlamps. The guide was friendly but was unable to answer many of my questions. He stated he would ask someone else and get back to me, but never did. After the cave, there is a meal but it was unimpressive. There was chicken, rice, salad, and fruit. There was a good lime soup, a traditional Mayan dish, but the chicken looked unappetizing and due to food safety issues, we didn't eat any salad. We also passed on cooked cactus, which looked good, but it had raw tomatoes in it. Over all, we loved the experience. We been in many caves in the US and Central America and this was one of our favorites."

Showers, washrooms and change rooms were provided before our trek. Wet suits, water shoes, and helmets with lights are provided. You will be putting them on wet which is normal. There are showers to finish off after as well. The meal is pretty simple...tacos, nachos etc. Nothing to get excited about but that is not what we came for anyway. This cenote is large and you will be walking/swimming in complete isolation other than your group and head lights. Pay attention to the guide as she/he knows the way. One of nature's wonders, this activity was beautiful! Truly a wonder. Pick up from our resort, tour, meal and return all in about 6 hours. Well worth it. We do not recommend the X trips as they are amusement park geared activities...unless you are looking for that."

            "review": "An Absolute Must!. Rio Secreto is the excursion that you don't want to miss. Discovered only six years ago the underground river complex is divided into three segments. One of which will comprise your tour, the section you get is randomly determined and each section takes about two hours to explore.You are provided everything you will need. You will need swim suits and clothing to change into after the tour. Please do not apply any lotions, shampoos, conditioners or any chemicals to your body or hair prior to the tour that could damage the fragile ecosystem.There is a large restroom/changing room/locker building. You will be given a locker key for to safely store your clothing as you change into your swimming suit. They also strongly suggest using the restroom to keep the cavern waters pristine. You will then be provided a wet suit, life jacket, lighted helmet, and aqua socks. I recommend you use their equipment as it has been selected specifically for the environment. They will also offer you a walking stick. I recommend you take one of these as well as they are very useful in finding underwater footholds and tripping hazards as well as helpful when bending low under stalactites. You will take a cleansing shower to keep the cave system free from body oils.It will be a short walk to the Cenote entrance and your guide will point out native jungle plants and trees along the way. Before descending the group will stop to partake in a traditional Mayan blessing which is amazing. Then into the underground cave complex for an hour and forty-five minutes of an unbelievable, beautiful, and unforgettable experience. Please don't touch anything. The oil from your finger can prevent the natural formations for growing for over 100 years. Unfortunately we saw people touching the cave environment as handholds, please use a walking stick.There are some low areas so people with knee or back issues should definitely use the provided walking stick. There are wet and slippery rock surfaces so attention to foot placement is important in places. The water depth will vary greatly but your head will never be submerged. Knowing how to swim is helpful but not necessary. There are brief times of total darkness but the caverns are large so claustrophobia should not be a major problem.After the tour you will return to your locker to change into dry clothing before being offered a delicious Mayan honey liquor and a lunch offering local foods and dishes."

Let me just say the ride was as much fun and exciting as the caves themselves...well maybe not. It was a CRAZY ride to the caves! Bumpy dirt roads and our driver thought he was Mario Andretti. Seriously, I think we took some corners on two wheels! When finally did arrive, in one piece, we were met by our tour guide, given some wet suites, helmets with headlamps, water shoes and a locker for our things. We took a short walk down a dirt path for a short spiritual service and then continued on the to the cave entrance. Its completely dark and that is why you have the helmet with a headlamp. Along with our tour guide we had a photographer that took some incredible pictures. You'll walk through shallow waters and crawl over rocks and swim through the deeper parts of the caves. We saw a few fish but not many and a huge spider! At the end of the tour we were served a Mexican lunch under a large pavilion. A very memorable experience!!"

The tour itself was still great as the cave system is absolutely beautiful!! You definitely must be mobile to get through some areas. I tend to get claustrophobic and I did not have any issues with any part of the tour. Another big difference between the first and second time we went, was the tour guide. On our first tour, the guide was very knowledgeable and spoke perfect English. The second time, she did not know the answers to many of our questions. It seemed that she just had a bunch of facts memorized and just spat them out. I think that it was overcrowded in general the second time and this definitely brought down the experience. That being said, it is a must see in the Riviera Maya and I guess just luck of the draw whether or not you get a good guide."

            "review": "The Cave Tour to End All Cave Tours. Outstanding attraction to visit during a Playa del Carmen visit. I went with my brother (who said this was \"the cave tour to end all cave tours\") and my two teenage daughters. We've been to Mammoth Cave and several other caves, but this tour is far more \"authentic\" and intense.We purchased tickets online prior to traveling to Mexico, for $67.50 each, and took a taxi from our resort to Rio Secreto ($31 ride). The entire operation at Rio Secreto is smooth and professional. We watched a short video, then took a 7km bus ride to the actual cave. Upon arrival, we were placed in a group of 6 (the 4 of us, plus another couple) with our own guide, Epco, whose Dutch humor and overall knowledge of the cave were entertaining. We were issued wetsuits (down to the knees), life vests, helmets, and water shoes, leaving everything else besides our bathing suits in free lockers. Then it was off on a short 5 minute hike to the cave opening with Epco, along with a photographer who ran ahead of us throughout the tour.The cave itself is simply wondrous. There is no artificial lighting, no wood walkways, no handrails, just the cave itself, in pristine condition. Within minutes we were up to our knees, then waists, in cool water. Most of the 90 minutes in the cave were spent submerged in 2-3 feet of water. In some spots, you actually swim (well, float - the life vests are strong) across 30-50 foot stretches. This is incredibly fun and exciting.The stalactites and stalagmites are in perfect condition, and massive abundance. Epco pointed out all sorts of different formations, explaining the conditions that cause the variations. Compared to more commercialized cave visits, everything feels incredibly authentic.The path through the cave varies - you're never quite certain what's around the next corner, but you definitely wish it would never end. At some points, we had to crawl under low ceilings. No passage is too narrow to cause claustrophobia - the feeling is awe rather than fear. The cave is, of course, pitch black, so the only lights are from your headlamp and from the guide's flashlight. It's just barely enough light to make out the floor and figure out where to step next.I'd invited my 79-year-old father to join us on the trip, but he declined. In retrospect, this was smart. While he's in great shape, I think Rio Secreto is probably best left only to folks around 65 or younger who can handle situations requiring a lot of balance and a lot of creeping and crawling up and down some pretty dicey footing. Also, obviously, you should be reasonably comfortable in water (although you never really \"swim\" due to the buoyancy of the wetsuit and life vest).After you emerge from the cave, there's a very nice Mexican buffet waiting. This hit the spot, and killed the time until our van was back to take us the 7km back to the front entrance. I also dropped $25 to purchase a single digital photo (I think you got every photo for $80, but we really only wanted 1 group shot inside the cave).We went to Rio Secreto frankly not expecting much. We were all absolutely blown away by this excursion. They've done a great job preserving the cave and crafting a visit experience that left us thrilled and satisfied."

My friends and I (6 of us) were on a cruise from December 6-13, Carnival Glory, Western Caribbean. I've been to Cozumel before so did not feel compelled to stay on the island at this stop. We decided to go on the Amazing Secret River excursion. We took a 45 minute ferry ride to the mainland then a bus to Rio Secreto. We met our tour guide Nico who was absolutely fabulous! They provided the wet suits, helmets, head lamps, life vests and shoes or you can bring your own which I did. You have to shower before putting them on to get rid of fragrances, oils, etc before going into the caves. We then had a ceremony with one of the natives before hiking into the caves. We were in the caves for about 1.5 hours. A photographer followed us the whole time. We took many group and couple's photos together. Nico was very knowledgeable and had a great personality. After the cave tour, they gave us a couple of shots of the local moonshine. We then had an authentic Mexican lunch. Food was excellent. They sold us the CD with all of the pics on it for $69. Then we took our bus and ferry back to the ship. When we got home, we realized we lost the CD somehow. I emailed the company and they responded immediately. They emailed all of the pictures to me, free of charge. Saved the day! The pictures are gorgeous and a must by if you go on this tour. Just make sure they charge you the correct amount. They charged us in pesos and I think we were overcharged. I highly recommend this tour. It does require some athletic ability including swimming and hiking. No pregnant women allowed (one tried to go on this tour and was told no, didn't matter what form she signed). This tour is for adventurous people who are not afraid of the dark."

But this attraction is not for the weak of heart. If you're phobic of the dark or not very mobile, it would be challenging on this tour, as you need to walk/swim/climb through caves. The tour provides us with wet suits, life jacket, helmet with head lamp, and wet shoes. There were lockers to store your personal belongings, and you can't bring your camera. There will be a staff that joins you along the way, taking pictures, which you can buy at the end of tour. Package costs approx. US$79 on a disk, which you can share in a group. Tour comes with a nice lunch. But make sure you take some gravol if you can't bear a rough 25-min ride between the main entrance and the cave itself. Overall, I would recommend this excursion."

Overall it was excellent and very unique. They provide everything you need and our guide Nico was really great. The caves are incredibly beautiful and the water is crystal clear. Before entering the cave you receive a Mayan blessing which was awesome and following the tour a lovely Mayan lunch is served. You are with a small group 8-10 and the guide stays with you the entire time. There is also a photographer that follows you and at the end you have the opportunity to purchase photos (you can't bring a camera into the cave). Photo packages range from $25-200 USD. A couple of warnings, if you're claustrophobic this is not the tour for you. Also if you are expecting a open air cenote with aquamarine water to swim in, this is not the tour to take. This is very much a cave tour. If you have mobility issues I wouldn't recommend this either as it was a little difficult navigating the uneven floor. Finally the drive from the entrance of this attraction to the actual caves is quite long and on an extremely bumpy dirt road. I suffer from motion sickness and this drive really bothered me, something to consider if this is an issue for you. The water is chilly but not bad once you're in.Overall I would highly recommend this tour, the facilities were very nice and the tour guides and employees truly are concerned about keeping this natural wonder in good shape for years to come. It's very peaceful in the cave and is like nothing I've ever experienced. ."

It hasn't even been explored all the way through, and has the potential to be the largest underground river in the world. This is definitely something you should check out while it's still new.Gonzo was our guide and he was very informative. You could tell he loved his job. On this trip, you will learn about the science behind the river and the culture surrounding it. It is definitely one of the coolest things I've ever seen."

There are two options, the basic - I think $99 which goes through the underground river and the upgrade - I think $119 that includes more background info and a light show underground. All 4 of us thought the upgrade was worthwile. Then there is the trip down the underground river. There are three paths and we took the most challenging (you don't have an option but this worked well and may always be the one used when you get the upgraded tour). It's a half mile underground combination walk and swim. It pitch black and the only light comes from headlamps that everyone wears. Each person wears a light jacket and the guide for our group of 4 people helped my wife who doesn't swim. The lunch that was included was pretty good. Highly recommended."

We were pleased, that it didn\u2019t got artificial like the other attractions starting with a X---. You still have the opportunity to visit the natural path of the underground rivers. The guides are very knowledgeable and are speaking very good English. The tour takes about 1.5 hours with additional 30-45 minutes to drive out and back and get the equipment on and off. You get all the needed equipment at site \u2013 wetsuit, swim west, water shoes, helmet and head lamp. If you want, you can book the tour with a buffet style lunch after it. We preferred to book without and went for a nice lunch in nearby Playa del Carmen. We booked through internet and paid by credit card over phone. I can highly recommend this tour to every one interested in nature and exploration."

            "review": "Once in a lifetime experience!. I booked \u2018The Amazing Secret River\u2019 tour through my Carnival cruise ported at Cozumel and found it to be very well organized. We were escorted to a blue and yellow jet boat that loaded and embarked on the ten mile journey to Playa Del Carmen. This was the only time I felt queasy at sea. Playa Del Carmen, visited 23 years ago by me was shockingly modern. There\u2019s a new outdoor mall with many upscale shops just like in the United States being built. I stopped into Starbucks for an iced espresso and my app worked on my phone in Mexico. It\u2019s that seemless. We took a van ride from Playa Del Carmen with 6 others from our ship and about 4 more people to the recently discovered Rio Secreto complex between Xel-ha and Xcaret on the multi lane divided highway 407 running from Cancun to Tulum in the Mayan Riviera. Once on the property, there we rode another 35 minutes on a rough road to the coordination areas. Our group of 12 was led by a very gracious English-speaking guide who helped us with the whole experience. This is a natural wonder that is run by a very savvy management group. Between 300 and 400 people tour the 18 mile underground caves daily, generally in groups of 8-12. Admission on the Rio Secreto website is $109pp with transportation, so Carnival isn\u2019t marking this one up at all with the extra boat transfers from Cozumel. After putting all of our belongings into lockers, we donned the optional half wet suits with aqua socks and lighted helmets, showered and then trekked through the jungle to the Cenote opening of the cave system. The guide recommended walking sticks for the caves because they help with stability and give you a sense of the underwater cave floor beneath you. We stopped along the way for pictures by our photographer who accompanied our guide. Along the way, a separate, optional stop included a blessing by a guy acting as a Mayan priest with incense. We spent about 90 minutes in the cave itself, which was spectacular and definitely a highlight of my trip. It\u2019s unbelievably cool and otherworldy there with all of the stalactites and stalagmites. You'll duck and swim a little along the way. It\u2019s also potentially very dangerous, but we were in good hands. We ended the trip with a shot of a local cinnamon-anise liqueur and a pitch for the photos and packages. Since you can\u2019t bring any cameras into the caves, these are your only options. They have a modern pavilion showing you pictures from your tour on little ipads and imacs, (surprisingly sophisticated!) and the packages were available with pictures available singly for $25 a piece, an entire personalized CD of pictures of your group and 50 additional shots of the cave for $89, or for $119, the CD with 2 T-shirts and 2 bottles of liqueur. Ka-ching. The liqueur is delicious! We finished with an all you can eat Mayan buffet of soup, vegetables, mini tacos and fruit. Drinks are extra, but the meal was adequate and filling. It gave us an opportunity to get to know our tour mates just a little better and fill out their feedback forms on how to make the experience better. I couldn't think of anything. They're doing pretty much everything right with this tour."

We got just the one and then it was only on a disc and not even a print of it!!After that there is a very average buffet and you wait around until all the groups are done before getting the can back.....I wish there had been an express option that didn't include the lunch. It also felt long as we were the last group in the cave and the first one out which was annoying as we then had to wait around. Not sure if this is because we had a shorter trail or if we did it faster."

It was very awe inspiring and one of my fave lifetime experiences! It was really cool when the guide turned the lights off and getting to experience and feel what it would be like to be down there without light!Make sure you bring proper water shoes to get through watery, slippery, muddy, rocky areas. Also, I did this with a sprained ankle with some help from my bf and the walking stick they provided. It IS a bit physical, but there were kids as young as 6-7 that were with us. It gets a bit chilly, but if you keep moving it's fine. They also provided wet suits and helmets with lights (make sure you get a good light!). FYI- you can't really bring anything with you.No cameras are allowed (not much of a chance to be able to pull one our and take a pic anyway, too dark without a really good cam and flash), you are going to want to buy the pics later which I think were $50? Can't remember, but worth the $!It's a long, windy, kind of scary drive to get there, and the tour takes a few hours too! At the end, we got a great buffet of food and the tour guide talked of the caves and his personal adventures."

My husband and I chose to do this as an excursion on our cruise. We were not at all disappointed. We would recommend to go with friends (Also, on the cruise as well) for the single reason that you will be grouped with strangers with the possibility to mar the glorious creation you will be seeing with foul language and conversation. And your pictures of this awesome excursion will also be with these strangers... That said...

It does NOT feel like a tourist trap, even though hundreds of people travel through the underground cave every day. It's hard for me to pay for extra excursions while paying so much money for an all inclusive resort at the same time - but this one is certainly worth it. I would have gone on a repeat journey right away, let alone when we come back to Mexico.They provide all of the gear you need - wet suit, water shows, helmet, and head lamp. The water is cool, but I wouldn't call it cold. I may be biased from swimming in the Canadian Atlantic ocean my whole life though! The food at the end of the tour was authentic and well prepared. The only odd thing was the lime/tortilla soup had no chicken or tortillas!They take photos of you during your trip and because you are not allowed to take your own camera or GoPro with you, those are the only memories you can get. They are also very expensive, but they were really nice and there was enough of them to make it almost worth it. We loved our trip so much we did buy them, and are begrudgingly happy with that decision ($80-90USD for all of the photos, $25USD for a single photo).Take a 1/2 day out of your plans and visit Rio Secreto - you won't regret it."

The water shoes are especially important - do not bring cheap walmart ones - you will slip and slide when you go up the embankments. The pictures at the end are wonderful but be aware that they are not cheap. The CD will only have pictures of you and your spouse - not everyone in the group so dont think that you can just email them to a new friend you made in the group and split the costs. They do tell you that at the end and it is true. We bought the pictures and do not regret the decision. The food at the end is good, but you dont get much time for the lunch - just the 15 minutes it takes for them to prepare your CD. Something you should do once if you happen to be in the area."

But, we didn't want to go to the most popular site that had been described to us as an \"amusement park\" style experience that most tourists visit via large tour buses. So, we made arrangements for a private tour and headed to Rio Secreto. We arrived not really knowing what to expect, and there was a bit of a delay once we arrived while we waited for a few more people to arrive. But, once we were all suited up in our wet suits, life vests and water shoes we were ready to head down into the caves. Once we entered the caves, all we can say is WOW!! It's an experience unlike any other we've ever had and we can't recommend enough. If you want to experience the underground caves and rivers as they should be, and not as an amusement park ride, this is the place to do it.

The cave is beautiful and the terrain is challenging. Our guide, Alina, was very knowledgeable and patient and she helped to guide our 7 year old. The gear that was provided was clean and helped to keep us comfortable. This was one of the best excursions we have ever been on. The pictures are quite expensive. We brought $50 thinking that it would be enough but it was not. We also had a nice Mexican lunch following the tour that was included. It was a great experience."

This advice comes from a traveller who has been to 35 U.S. states and 17 countries on three different continents. Be sure and wear the wetsuit as the water is roughly 67 degrees. Even if you don't swim, you'll float along nicely while wearing the life vest. You may have to doggy paddle in a few places as the water is deep in areas. Bring your own water shoes (if you own any); if not, they ARE provided."

It was a little challenging but our guide Alex took very good care of us and made sure we stayed together and gave us interesting information throughout the tour. I would suggest taking the walking stick they offer before the tour. It really helped. The cave was beautiful and the professional photographer who came along with us got some amazing shots.

You are delivered by your driver who gets you your bands. You then watch a short safety and history film. You are then driven 12-14 kilometers into the rain forest where you are greeted and taken to changing areas. They do have lockers. You are given water shoes if you don't have your own. I recommend using your own because some of their shoes are quite worn. You are fitted with wet suits and a helmet. There is a ritual process that welcomes you into the caves by the Mayan gods. Then you walk through the rainforest approx. 10 minutes to the entrance of the caves. There are 4 different entrances. When you enter the cave, you must be careful because there are narrow passages and it can be very slippery because of the wetness. They do discourage touching the formations because they can be ruined. You will walk through foot paths as well as swim through others. Inside the cave can be very tricky to maneuver. It does require some physical agility. This takes approx. one hour give or take. There is a photographer that takes photos and you are able to purchase photos or the whole DVD. When you are done, there is a nice lunch prepared for you...included in the price. Our tour guide was Louis. Very good at what he does. He was also giddy because he had just gotten married 2 months ago. His wife works there as well. I highly recommend this tour. Just make sure you are able to walk without difficulty and take your time. It is slippery and you can get hurt."

It's nearly 6 months since our trip and our 11 year daughter still talks passionately about our amazing experience on our trip to Rio Secreto. Our entire family agrees it was the easily the highlight of our cruise or any vacation destination and we want to return one day. This is not a superficial, commercialized, passive, wet your toes tour! You have incredible access to the inner caverns and their beauty is magnificent and awe-inspiring! It was one of the best spent 1.5 hours of my life. The cost is ridiculously low for the experience and overall quality of the tour. Our guide, Alfredo, was exceptional and highly recommended if you can get him! He was professional, knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, patient and fun. We still talk about him and miss him like a friend! The CD photo album is a must! The pictures were clear, high quality, well framed, and documented every desirable step of the journey. It is a memory maker we cherish and is worth much more than it cost, which was reasonable. The additional bonus photos provided are spectacular. We even received high quality t-shirts for each family member as another bonus! This not just an incredible and unique experience of Mexico, but of our planet! We were thrilled and I still get excited and rave and recommend it to anyone and everyone I meet. The organization of the tour was excellent and provided for every need. The buffet is included at the end and was delicious with a wide variety of food and generous time given to enjoy it. Overcome any mind blocks and taste the majesty of creation! THANK YOU TO ALFREDO AND ALL THE PEOPLE at Rio Secreto who made it possible for us to share this cave of true wonders! God bless you!!!"

            "review": "Absolutely Must-Do!. In short: from start to finish, the experience was not only immensely informative and adventurous, it even pushed me out of my comfort zone while still helping me feel safe and secure. Yes, even in the pitch black of a cave many meters underground.When we arrived at Rio Secreto after an hour (roughly) drive from our hotel in Cancun, we were greeted by a friendly reception team that got us checked in quickly and helped us get oriented to the excursion with a short video in Spanish, English, and French. (I\u2019d imagine they have other languages too, depending on the native languages of guests.) Since I was taking the \u2018Plus\u2019 tour, I piled into a van with several other guests, including a couple who would be the only other two on our private tour. I will say that the 7km drive into the jungle was not friendly to me and my motion-sensitive stomach, but after arriving, the activities kicked off so quickly that any woozy feelings I had were soon gone.Our guide, Rodrigo or \u201cRo,\u201d was the pinnacle of perfect adventure tour guide. His attentiveness to the group made us all feel not only like VIPs, but as unique VIPs, experiencing the caves in a special way that nobody had before. During his custom-built itinerary, we explored all of the major paths through the cave, rather than sticking to just one. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself already!To start out, we went into a dry part of the cave to learn more about cenotes, caves, underground rivers, and the importance of these geologic features to the ancient Mayan people who inhabited the Yucatan. Through the introduction of four \u2018portals,\u2019 we learned how the Mayans viewed these cave entrances, and the spiritual inhabitants therein, as sacred places, and made sacrifices accordingly. We also watched a fascinating video that combined spoken word/poetry with moving images (moving as in, they moved and they were evocative), and the intensity of cave walls to tell the story of the universe\u2026. Sitting in an underground theater to watch the 25-minute show was oddly relaxing and also anchored me even more to the significance and uniqueness of the experience I was about to have.Once we suited up and donned our wetsuits, Ro led us through the jungle to be blessed by a Mayan priest with a traditional saying to help us be purified before entering the caves, and transformed by our experiences. Then, we descended.Underground caves are fascinating\u2014I\u2019ve been in several before, but never one with water, and never one so open for exploration\u2014most caving tours I\u2019ve done have limited access to \u2018hallways\u2019 and \u2018rooms\u2019 (I\u2019m not sure about the technical terms here, folks), but the team at Rio Secreto has done an immense amount of exploration and though they claim to only take their tours through a small portion of the accessible caves (there are miles of fully submerged caves below the ones the tours can move through), it feels like you\u2019re exploring a huge space.In the process of our tour, several other notable things happened: first, I learned how to walk in deep water with limited visibility. The water is very clear, but as the group moves in single file, there is sediment that can be stirred up, and that makes seeing underwater rocks tricky. With the help of the guide and my trusty wooden walking stick, I soon became adept at navigating unseen obstacles, and our group was so proficient that Ro remarked that he was rarely so lucky as to have such an able tour. Hang on, let me brush the dirt off my shoulders.We did a complete \u2018black out\u2019 in the caves\u2014Ro brought us to a stable, calm part of the caves away from other tour groups, and had us close our eyes while he turned off all the lamps we had brought with us. Opening one\u2019s eyes into complete darkness is truly disorienting but also a great test of mental grit\u2014I found myself almost terrified by the loud pounding of my heart.There\u2019s also a photographer that moves throughout most of the tour with each group. With our small group, I got some excellent adventurous photos and the photographer is quite good at capturing moments for posterity and later enjoyment. If you see the camera up, it\u2019s best to smile, because there\u2019s definitely a photo opportunity coming! This includes the dry portion of the caves if you opt for the \u2018Plus\u2019 access.After arriving back above ground level, we took a leisurely walk back to camp to rinse off and change for lunch. Before we tucked in, Ro brought our group to the lodge where we could review our photos, and made sure we all tried a sip of a local annis and honey liqueur that I made sure to buy a bottle of for consumption when I want to be transported back to the Yucatan jungle. A traditional meal of tacos, rice, beans, lime soup, and papaya were served buffet style, and it felt a bit like being back at summer camp.I\u2019d highly recommend Rio Secreto for people who are interested in exploring underwater caves\u2014while I haven\u2019t visited other excursions in the area who take advantage of similar formations, I believe that Rio Secreto\u2019s focus on just giving an immersive experience in the underground river helps guests have a uniquely focused experience, rather than a jumble of exciting adventure activities. The tour is long, especially the \u2018Plus\u2019 option\u2014we left our hotel at 8am and didn\u2019t arrive back until almost 3pm, and definitely felt as though we had enjoyed enough of the caves to feel like we would have gotten our money\u2019s worth. There are some rules\u2014children must be a certain age, you must be physically able to navigate the passages (which as I\u2019ve mentioned are at times a bit strenuous), and there are plenty of stairs and uneven pathways to conquer\u2013, but that shouldn\u2019t stop most adventurers from making this a necessary part of their itinerary. There\u2019s a whole world beneath your feet when visiting Cancun and the Yucutan, and if you\u2019re looking for a truly immersive way to experience it, Rio Secreto is the way."

We were a group of six and looking for some adventure. We got picked up at our hotel and spent ten minutes getting to Rio Secreto where a ten minute video and a half hour ride on a brumby road led us to the staging area. Our guide for the walk/swim was Carlos. He took us on a very beautiful, safely conducted walk through underground caves filled with clear water and spectacular features. Carlos, who spoke three languages, was able to convey the beauty and importance of the caves and water network to the Mayan and Mexican economy. We were led safely for about a half mile through the caves and had nothing but wonderful things to say about Carlos and the photographer who tried his best to stay out of our way and still get fotos. If you are in the area and have a half day you gotta go to Rio Secreto."

With most guided tours I usually feel a disconnect between the tour guide and the rest of the group. But with Luis everything was easy; we were all in on an adventure together, and we were going to help each other through it and discover and enjoy as if it were the first time.Luis guided us through the most beautiful experience I have ever had. One thing to keep in mind, as others will say, is that the water is COLD; however, they provide the water shoes and the wet suits for you, and after a few seconds you forget how cold you are because of all of the AWESOME around you. There are definitely times where you may lose your footing, so I would definitely suggest to either go with a group that you are comfortable with falling/grabbing onto, or get very personable very quickly. No spoilers, but if you get claustrophobic this might not be the best tour for you. Amateur spelunkers, this is a must.The tour ends after a few hours with a group shot of Xtabentun, and a surprisingly good buffet dinner. Hammocks are ready for you as you wait for your bus to take you back to your hotel/resort. I could not recommend this trip more. GO GO GO!!!"

It is a long trip to get there - a ferry ride (we were docked in Cozumel), then about a 40 minute ride in a van, but totally worth it. You are deep into the jungle when you arrive. You a given a locker, wetsuit, water shoes, life jacket and helmet with a light on it. Everything goes in the locker - you cannot take anything with you into the cave. Your guide (we had Luis who was very knowledgable) will explain the history and how the caves were formed. After a short walk you will stop to be blessed my one of the natives before you enter the caves. Once you descend underground you are taken into a beautiful underground river flowing through caverns with exotic formations all around. Tiny droplets hanging on the end of the stalactites look like stars because there are so many. The water is cool (you would not want to be in there without a wetsuit) but very clear and beautiful. The floor of the caverns can be very uneven and you will need to duck your head in places. There are a few places where you actually float but the water is not that deep in most places. If you are physically able to see this place, you should see it. I would go back again and again. The area is well kept up with clean restrooms and even hammocks. My only gripe is that the photos they take are very expensive. Otherwise this is a must-visit place."

If you have a wet suit bring that too as the ones provided were - well - very wet and cold to put on. However all were minor compared to the absolutely spectacular journey underground. We were treated to a Mayan ceremonial blessing by a Mayan Shaman which was unique and ghave us some insight into the Mayan heritage.Then we were led underground by our excellent tour guide Alex who spoke fluent English and helped all of us every step of the way.There were 9 of us altogether (one family group) and the expereience was simply breathtaking. The crystal clear waters of the underground river and the lagoons with stalactites coming from the ceiling just took your breath away with their beauty.We ended the tour in a large lagoon and shut of the lights to experience pure darkness and silence.

            "review": "Makes you appreciate Mother Nature. After getting geared up and have a shower to rinse off all products and oils, you take a trek to the mouth of a cave. There are many different entrances to this natural wonder. You will partake in the \"cleansing\" ceremony performed by Maya descendant. You are wearing a wet suit, because the water a bit chilly, but after the hike to get to the cave, it is refreshing. There is uneven ground with rocks in the water to navigate around. I recommend bringing your own water shoes, the ones I had, had holes in the toes which let in coarse sand. Water levels varied from calf/knee deep to swimming (you do have life vests on). There are spots you have to crouch and waddle thru the rock formations. This is an amazing tour. The guides are very informative and passionate about preserving this wonderful piece of nature. Do not participate if you are claustrophobic or afraid of darkness. You do wear a head lamp on your helmet, but there are times you will be turning them off to truly appreciate the marvels of this cave. It was an experience of a life time. There is a lunch following the excursion on location. Delicious. Highly recommended."

Rio Secreto is a must if you do not suffer of claustrophobia. The experience in total darkness was amazing. Long minutes where you can see absolutely nothing !! Loved it and I strongly recommend it."

Our guide Hulio was very informative and obviously loved his job and so would I if I could do his job everyday. Obviously these are guided tours so there is definitely no going off on your own, if you did the likelyhood is that you would never been seen again! There are kilometres of caves with more being discovered all the time. Groups are no more than 10 and this tour is even suitable for non swimmers, wetsuit, bouyancy aid, swim shoes and helmets are provided. Rio Secreto definitely needs to be added to the To Do list"

But there are a few things you should know...I'm sure other reviewers have probably covered this, but here goes:Its a 100% guided tour, so don't expect to be able to explore the caves on your own...the guides keep a pretty tight lid on the tourists...which is fine, but if you are like me and are more of an adventurous type, it may annoy you. Also..the water is cold guys. It bothers some people depending on how sensitive you are to that type of thing..the staff will dish out thin ply wetsuits to those that want them to aide in the cold temps, but I still heard a few people whining about the cold even with the suits, so just be aware of that.All in all a good time...worth the time and pesos if spelunking is your kind of adventure."

A true trip of a lifetime, it left us totally speechless - literally.Our experience was with the Privilege Tour which was 5 amazing hours in this wonderful underworld. A short orientation, we were outfitted with top quality gear: full wetsuit, lifejackets, booties, helmet and headlamps on, we embarked into the underworld journey deep into the jungle to find one of many hidden entrances of Rio Secreto. There is just four of us, our gentle guide extraordinaire Alfredo, our very own photographer Carlos and us. Alfredo is a physcologist living his dream everyday at Rio Secreto. His passion and deep personal connection for this place echoes from every single word he speaks. Carlos meanwhile smiles quietly in the background capturing our marvel on film. Some have commented about not being allowed cameras, being a amateur photographer myself I would have loved my camera also but I can understand why it was better to leave it behind. I thought about how much a camera would change my experience. I would be so busy with photos I would forget to enjoy what I was seeing and feeling. The second thing is the light, you really need professional camera and lightning to do justice to this magic place. What\u2019s so pleasing about R\u00edo Secreto, aside from being the Riveria Maya\u2019s jewel destination, it\u2019s 100% Mexican-based and it\u2019s mission is based around eco-tourism. This is truly evident is everything we saw. I don\u2019t need to tell you that I highly recommend Rio Secreto, you already know that and if you miss it on your trip to the Yucatan then you\u2019ve missed a real treasure. Our Privilege Experience was sponsored by \u2018Rio Secreto Mexico\u2019. As always, our thoughts and writings are based solely on our experiences.

            "review": "Awesome Underground River & Cave. My friends and I visited Rio Secreto on October 30, and we really had a great time. The cave itself is absolutely stunning - the formations are so pristine, and the river itself is crystal clear. When you go, keep in mind that you will NOT need to apply any sunscreen (or deodorant or hair gel or lotion) because this adventure is all underground. When you arrive at the location, you're greeted by your guide, who explains the process and advises you what to expect - you should know right away that you cannot take your own photos or videos on this excursion. There will be staff there to take photos of you... and yes, you can purchase those photos on a CD for $79. While that may seem like a lot of money, keep in mind these photos are incredible... they truly do a great job of capturing the moment. You would not be able to capture the same quality of photos the staff does since the cave is LITERALLY PITCH BLACK when your headlamps are turned off. There's a part during the tour where our guide asked us to turn off all lights and just sit and listen to the cave... and as crazy as that sounds, it was nothing short of other-worldly... sitting in pitch-black darkness, listening to the cave drip is an experience you'll remember forever. In total, the tour takes about 90 minutes, and when finished, you'll have a buffet-style meal - ours was chicken with beans & rice, tortillas, pasta, and salad. The food was okay - nothing stellar. After your meal, you'll be swiftly returned back to your hotel for whatever your night may hold.In my opinion, this was a great excursion - I don't think I'll find myself visiting another underground river and cave system anytime soon. I highly recommend this tour for anyone looking for a natural experience in the Riviera Maya."

My husband and I recently returned from Mexico, where we went on a couple hour journey through Rio Secreto with a small group of about ten people. The cave system is absolutely beautiful with many different formations all throughout. Our tour guide, Alfredo, was wonderful - he was knowledgeable and welcoming, and he obviously has a passion for his job and exploring the world underground. My husband and I have visited many different caving systems, but none quite like this. It was a very unique experience to wade and swim through the crystal clear waters. We were lucky enough to spot some cave wildlife on our tour, including a catfish and bat. The staff were professional and friendly. Since we weren't allowed cameras inside, they had a staff photographer go through with us and take photos. He did an amazing job, and we purchased their DVD at the end of our tour. We enjoyed participating in a Mayan soul cleansing ritual before going into the caves, and then a delicious authentic Mexican lunch afterwards. Overall we were very pleased with our tour and we would definitely recommend it for anyone visiting Mexico."

After a while its a lot the same and even though you are wearing a shorty wet suit, it gets a little cold. Lastly, they don't allow any pictures hoping you'll buy their $89 picture package, or $25 for a picture. We couldn't even take a group photo once we were dressed in our set suits and helmet with light because you have to leave all photo gear and phones in the locker before you get dressed. Having paid $100 a person, we should have been able to come away with at least one group picture."

If I could have floated around in water over my head in the dark for hours I would have been content. An almost supernatural experience that I'm glad I have.If you have any issues with a bumpy ride you may want to think otherwise though (hence the four star and not five star review). The road to the attraction was very, very rough. The ride was not ten minutes from N. Playa Del Carmen as we were told. It was much longer."

You are given all the gear you will need: Wet-suit, booties, life vest, helmet with a light... and you're set. They divide every tour into small (no more than 10 people) groups, and you're given a nice, knowledgeable, friendly, and yes - English speaking, guide. A short walk through the rain forest and you're entering a magnificent cave - stalagmites and stalactites EVERYWHERE... some place you walk, some you're hip or waist deep, some you have to swim. Towards the end we had to take off our life vests so that we can crouch down enough to pass - the space between surface of the water and the top of the cave only as tall as your head. Barely. :-) Like I said, no Claustrophobics need apply ;-)It was Spectacular. I highly recommend."

We took a 45 minute ferry from the port to the mainland where the Rio Secreto staff met us and took us by van to the site, which was about 15 minutes inland. Our guide (Nunez) met us, explained everything, got us our gear (wet suits, water shoes, life preservers, helmets with lights), and took us to the caves. (Clean bathrooms and secure lockers are available for your use.) The 1 1/2 hour walk/swim/tour through the caves was unbelievable and amazing! Our guide knew as much as any scientist, and guided us every step of the way! The water was warm, the cave was a comfortable temperature, and the route was well marked, so there is no fear of getting lost... After the tour, you eat authentic Mexican food from their buffet...the food is excellent. You are taken right back to where you started. Very professional. Everyone is very nice. You won't find a better excursion. Unforgettable. Thank you!"

Located approx. 15min outside of Playa Del Carmen the tour starts above ground with a quick video tutorial offered in many languages. Small groups, based on spoken language, meet a guide for the tour. You're outfitted with a wet-suit, life-vest, helmet and water shoes (or bring your own). All personal belongings, including cameras, jewelry, hair clips must stay out of the cave system. You'll even wash the soaps, deodorants and perfumes from your skin before entering.You learn about the cultural and water-supply significance of the cave system on your tour. A quick group blessing and you're off to the underground.You'll walk and float your way through the pitch black - blacker than any black you've seen before - led by your guide (hola Paolo) and a helmet light. The water level on the predetermined path will vary from a few inches to a few feet but there are a few passages that you will need to float across in your life vest.The cave adventure is relatively new. This system is a recent Mexican discovery and has only been marginally mapped to date. This is an experience that only a few others have ever shared.After your tour you are treated to a meal of typical Yucatan cultural relevance; all fair claimed to be from the local lands. The Modelo Especial is available for purchase and is a perfect afternoon beverage before your shuttle ride back to your resort. Booking through the resort tour operator we paid $70US per person. The all natural underground river of the Yucatan, Rio Secreto, is a fun day trip while visiting."

Pablo our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about revealing the beauty of an otherwise unknown paradise. Rio Secreto was a true body, mind and spiritual experience.

Shoes provided, but we bought at reception, only 10 U.S. Dollars, cheaper than the supermarket!I also took stick to help in the cave, glad I did, others in party wished they had done the same, as you cannot touch the surrounding rock.The actual tour took approx 90 minutes. Julio was very knowledgable, and very enthusiastic about showing us his underground home,the network of caves was incredible and even more so to think they were only discovered 7 years ago.We clambered over the cave floor, through water, at some stages having to swim.The whole experience was fantastic, absolutely stunning caves. A photographer joined the group, capturing some very special memories for us.When we emerged from the cave, we sampled a local Mayan liqueur, before lunch.Lunch was disappointing, although we had been warned by our hotel concierge.Would thoroughly recommend this venue, one of the highlights of our holiday."

My husband and I love Playa del Carmen and wanted to do an excursion this time. We were married in Playa and had been to a cenote, so decided to do Secreto instead. SOOOOO HAPPY!We took a taxi from our hotel, ($15US) instead of a bus and got there at 9:15am for a 10am tour. This proved to be very lucky. Usually they take you in a group of 8-10, but some people for the earlier tour did not show, so we ended up being 4 people in a 9:30am tour with Viktor. The whole experience was positive. Viktor was knowledgeable and answered all of our questions- he was patient and easy to listen to. Here are my tips1. take your own water shoes and make sure they are snug with a good sole-you do walk on uneven terrain and some areas in the water you have to walk very carefully as swirling sediment will impede your view.2. unless you are very athletic- take a walking stick! this helped my balance but also helped me navigate depth3. be steady on your feet- this is not for someone with mobility issues4. enjoy the silence and the breathtaking cave!When we came out we were greeted with a shot of 'mayan' water and towels, then taken for lunch and to see our pics. On one hand,I wish we had a camera, but on the other hand, the beauty of these caves are the silence and the light. Too much picture taking would have been too distracting from the experience. I also think (trust me) you need all of your hands for balance and navigation. Four people on this tour really worked for me- I feel 8-10 too many. Viktor didn't need to shout and it was incredibly intimate. There are times you are swimming, then crawling, then climbing. Our guide really helped to show how to step etc.. so as to not slip. We bought one pic for 20$ and were happy with that- lunch was good and they provided a service that took us back to our hotel. Do yourself a favour- spend some time in these caves. You won't be sorry!"

You have to watch your step at all times so i understand not taking your own camera in the safety sense. I wasnt real impressed with the photos we purchased but the memory and experience more than make up for it. We also had a lunch afterwards that was very good.

It is beautiful, well-preserved and maintained so that visitors feel safe. I've been yo a few others, and they don't hold a candle to Rio Secreto. Its just that amazing.Our tour guide, Alejandro, was kind and knowledgeable. He wasn't the most fun guide in the world, but we learned a lot and felt safe and welcome. He was very accommodating of our mixed-language group.The hiccups:1. They never sent me a confirmation or any other email besides my receipt. When we called to inquire about our pickup, they told us to take a cab because they didn't know where to pick us up. We had entered the info on the form. We hadn't been contacted to find out more, or to let us know they weren't coming. This was obviously a fairly common mistake as they had a system for paying the taxi driver upon our arrival. 2. They refuse any cameras. They say its because people were looking at the digital camera screens and falling down in the cenote. However, they also won't allow go-pros or other mounted cameras. Instead, they take a series of posed pictures throughout the tour and sell them for $77-$170 at the conclusion. They need to change the policy."

It seems everyone really enjoys their jobs, everyone was very friendly. Our tour guide was Alex and he was excellent, especially since we had one person in our group who didn't know how to swim(which you don't really need to know how to swim) and was nervous. Alex made him feel at ease and was very patient. Rio Secreto is a natural underground river with stalactites and stalagmites. It's just amazing to see. Use the walking stick, it was very helpful for all of us. Also, we learned that there's different levels easy, medium and advanced. When you get your wetsuit, they size you up and determine which course to take. We took the medium, kind of wished we had the advance. We all had a great time."

This isn't purely a cave under the ground, this truly is a life changing journey. The long and twisting caverns systems are absolutely filled with stalagmites, stalactites, columns, and underwater features too! Everywhere you turn, you will be amazed.This wasn't simply some touristy trip. Very little of the long tour was on even or paved ground. You get in a wetsuit with lifejacket and water shoes for thos excursion. You will be walking through ankle to knee deep water almost the entire way and swimming in water over your head for a good quarter of it. If you want an adventure found only by cave divers without the danger of running out of oxygen in your tank, this is the closest experience you are going to find! Our guide Alfredo was a wonderful person and very knowledgeable and honest. I wish I had thought to give him a tip because he certainly deserved it. He helped my 7 year old daughter out almost the whole way through and we truly couldn't have felt more safe in such a magical and somewhat scary place. Somewhere I never knew existed, yet felt like I was returning home. Thank you again!"

Even though he freaked out in the caves, our guide, Pablo, was terrific with him. The water is cold and we appreciated the wet suits. In retrospect, I think the dark and the cold got to him. This tour pushed him outside of his comfort zone. I didn't mind the no outside camera policy. According to the Mayan tradition, we were entering a spiritual realm, the underworld. From our experience swimming and climbing and ducking through small tunnels, I believe that the caves would suffer damage from visitors cameras waving around. We were asked to immerse ourselves in the cave as a spiritual journey. It was nice to not see people taking selfies for a change. Yes, we took photos as a tour group. However, it did not distract from the tour. We purchased one photo as the rest were not in focus.It's rare that you can experience a living earth type tour with children these days. Seeing the water droplets that formed the caves really drove home the magnitude of the formations for all of us. Lunch was great. It was healthy and delicious."

Our photographer Sergio was amazing. he took pictures of us the whole time.After the tour was over, we finished drinking a native drink, prayer and a super great buffet included in the tour. The food was delicious. The pictures are 75 dollars, and they are worth it. Some reviews say they are expensive, but they are wrong. Normal cameras cant take pictures because there is no light, and second it will ruin the experience. 75 dollars for almost 60 pictures in great resolutions in cheap.thank you everyone for making our experience so good. hope to see you back soon"

We have recommended this trip to all of our friends going to Cancun. It's just amazing. Also, like the other reviews say, grab a walking stick for the tour. It makes the experience much more enjoyable and helps with pulling a partner along if they are weak swimmers during the swimming portion. Stick+Pablo= good times! Oh, the buffet is pretty nice after the 3 hour tour as well. Caldo de pollo, arroz and some other basic stuff. Drinks cost money etc... We ended up purchasing the photos even though we felt it was a little on the expensive side. However, the photos are well worth it!"

One needs the agility to find your footing on very uneven surfaces and don't be claustrophobic. The pace was good. The sights were awe inspiring. The tour is conducted in such a way as for your group to be virtually alone 99% of the time. The outdoor showers are a bit of a joke but hey, you get a little used to the temp of the hew water in the he cave and it makes getting into the equipment easier.We were able to wear our own water shoes although they have plenty for guests to use.The food was very very good. Fresh. Interesting. Varied. Plentiful. The buses were comfortable enough for the jungle ride. This is a rather low key ecological angle adventure-not the thrill ride variety."

This is, without a doubt, one of the best excursions we have ever done! We booked the excursion through Carnival (we normally don't book through the chi, but because there was a ferry and lengthy van ride involved, we thought it would be easier to leave it up to them).Our guide, Alfredo, was amazing. He was so passionate about sharing this experience with us, it really added to the trip. One thing this company does really, really well, is stagger small groups (8) so that you feel like you are literally the only people there. You can't bring a camera into the caves with you, and if you want memories, you can purchase either a thumb drive ($79USD) or a DVD ($59USD isn). We were aware of this ahead of time, and planned on the extra expense. Very worth it!!! you get pictures of your group, as well as some breathtaking \"stock\" photos of the caves and local plant and wild life. Lunch was included... an amazing authentic Mexican buffet... we were stuffed! I would highly recommend this trip to anyone, and would definitely spend the money to do it again."

I was traveling alone and was looking for excursions within my capabilities that I had never taken before. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this excursion! Of everything I booked on this cruise, this was the priciest, but was definitely the one I will remember for a lifetime! They provide you with a wet suit, water shoes, a life jacket, a walking stick, and a lighted helmet. Of note, you cannot take cameras or sunglasses into the ceynote, but there is a photographer who will accompany your tour and will take a lot of photos for sale at the end. Not cheap ($25 apiece), but I bought the CD for $79 and basically have an album of our tour. They also provide you with a private, secure locker for your possessions. There are apparently 3 different routes through this ceynote, and the route we took was called the Supremo. Our guide was Alina, and she was very skilled getting us though the caverns, pools, and rivers, and her knowledge of the history of the natural wonder only added to the adventure. You aren't required to wear the wet suit, but after an hour in the water you will definitely be chilled and I highly recommend you wear one. I loved, loved, loved this tour! I have been to Cozumel many times and have done many things there, but this is hands-down my favorite. After your time in the ceynote you will be provided with what they refer to as a snack, but it's really a full-blown lunch and was very good The shots of some sort of Mexican liquor they provided at the end didn't hurt either. The only downside for me was that I was alone and this was mostly couples who helped each other through some of the more difficult areas. Fortunately Alina took it upon herself to assist me whenever needed. You will not be disappointed when you spend the money on this trip."

The guide was very knowledgeable and informed us about the stalagmites and stalagtites and how they form. They provide their own photographer and the pictures turn out very nice - they are just horribly overpriced. The wetsuits, lifejackets, and helmets are all very good, but you should bring your own water shoes. They do provide them, but they are not in great shape and mine had holes in the toe region which allowed water to get into the shoe and thus my food slid a lot making it hard to walk. You need good, tight water shoes because there are a lot of rock formations and you will surely cut yourself or fall if your shoes do not fit properly. The lunch provided after the excursion was very good. Overall, this excursion was worth the price I paid which was $97 per person and included transporation from our resort, the tour, equipement needed for the tour, lunch, and transportation back to our resort."

Our French tour guide took the time to explain everything we saw in very good English. The underground waters were tranquil and a nice temperature (about the same as the ocean water). The formations were spectacular and unspoiled. Our route was about 1 Kilometer through the cave (apparently there are three different routes) and it took a couple hours to trek through it. Amazement at every turn. Its pitch black inside the caves, so the helmet lamp becomes your best friend. They give you all the necessary gear and equipment. Our group was pretty small only 5, so that was a treat as the guide could explain more. After completion of the journey, a nice drink, a shot of Mayan Ouzo and a nice light lunch buffet. We bought the CD with all the photos (a photographer will follow you through the caves but he takes a different route to preposition himself, so you don't feel like he's behind you the whole trip). Photos are superb and worth the money. Once you are finished make sure you tip your guide as they will also help you with your meal and getting you back to your transportation - we tipped $20US because the guide was superb and he went out of his way to help with our 8 year old in the caves.

I was a little hesitant because I float like a bag of rocks and there is some swimming involved. I'm very glad I went anyway. After changing into your swimsuit in the large bathroom changing area at the sight, and locking your belongings into a secure locker, we took an outdoor shower to clean all the chemicals off our bodies in order to preserve the purity of the water underground. Each participant wads then outfitted with a wet suit to wear over our swimsuits, water shoes, and a miners hardhat with a light mounted with it. Next we were purified in a short Mayan ritual to prepare you for entrance to the other world. We took a short hike through the jungle to the entrance to the underground world. Then the real adventure began. Our guide Carlos lead us on our descent into the underground. For the next hour and a half we walked, descended, swam, waded and climbed through an amazing array of passageways and caverns. I only had to swim three times, and each one was the distance of a small pool. I actually enjoyed it once I was certain I could not sink. At several points our guide paused to explain the fish, and amazing formations found throughout the caverns. I don't want to give everything away, but It was a truly wonderful experience. During the entire journey we had our own photographer constantly documenting our trip. After our ascent back to the surface, we changed back in to our original clothes and shared a drink of Mayan Champagne, a drink made of fermented honey and anise. It is tasty and potent, We then proceeded to a display room where we were able to view slideshows of our trip. They offer several options for pictures and merchandise you may purchase. No pressure, just a description of what is available, if you do decide to purchase anything they take your order and prepare it while you are on to your next stop which is a meal of fresh local Mexican food which is included in the excursion. One special note, my wife has Celiac disease and MUST eat Gluten-Free. She was able to eat a full meal and only 1 single item was not gluten free. If your have any doubts or concerns, simple explain to you guide what you cannot eat and he can verify which foods are safe. All the guides speak English very well and if you speak English and/or Spanish you should have no problems communicating. After eating I paid for our photos. They accept both cash and card, so no issues with payment. At the end of the trip we were transported back to our pickup point at the Ferry landing in the same air- conditioned vans that transported us to Rio Secreto. It is about a 15 minute drive through town and the jungle. The preserve is located right next to Xcaret. I cannot recommend this enough. If you want something truly unique this is it."

We spent about 2 hours inside the caves, this was the first time being in a cave system and everyone in the group felt completely safe. The water was crystal clear and we were able to see a few small catfish swimming around. The stalactites and stalagmites are amazing and made for a magical day. We did have a photographer with us for the entire tour, the photo were great and turned out much better than I anticipated. However, the price of the photos were way to expensive, so we passed.

            "review": "A beautifully overpriced cave.... If you have been to a cave and have seen stalctites and stalgmites, the admission fee ($USD 77 USD or $MXN1,000) is very steep for what it is. In the intro video they tell you that they donate a \"significant portion\" of the admission fee for the preservation of the cave. When I asked what is the significant portion, they referred me to the administrative office. For a company that claims to be promoting values of \"honesty\" they should be transparent with their customers about their value proposition. However, they market a trip to Rio Secreto as if it is comparable to going to the moon. Clear exaggeration. In the intro video they tell you you will see jaguars on the way to the cave. I spoke to the guide and he said in his 9 years working there he has not seen a single jaguar. Marketing! They market the experience as one that you need to have once in your lifetime. Yes, because you will not come back to pay the astronomical price again.Rio Secreto is a relatively recent discovery made a tourist attraction relying heavily on skewed marketing. The cave system itself is very impressive with its stalactites and stalgmites. The water inside the cave is crystal clear and it is a great experience if you have never been to a cave. They also overcharge for the photos ($USD 30 per person) or $USD135 for groups. They don't allow you to take your camera inside the cave. Even though they have a professional photographer they try to get you through the cave faster, more people, more money. They don't advertise the price of the photos upfront because they don't want to scare you away from the place. If you have the option go to the cenotes in the area do that or go to Xplor and you will see a cave and plus you will get to do more activities for couple of more dollars."

Wife was the one who want to do something like this, but in Julie fashion got herself terrified even before getting into the cave. I give a lot of thanks to our guide, Luis, who got her calm and made the whole experience possible. It was a unforgettable adventure. Cost was $79USD per person. They usually do groups of 10, but we got lucky as the last group of the day ans had the tour with just the four of us.This is not an amusement park like the many that start with the letter X. This is the real deal, an underground river cave system. If you want a slice of nature in all its glory I highly recommend this place."

The guide was very nice and informative. I brought my two boys aged 9 and 5 and they liked it but did find the water a bit cold. I loved everything about this experience and would highly recommend it.

We had a memeber in the group that was elderly and he took her under his wing through the whole tour under the ground. The sites were absolutely magical. The only bad thing is the price of the pictures 150$ is wayyyy too much money to pay. Specially if you have a small group. Since there are no cameras allowed, one is almost obligated into getting the pictures, or walk out empty handed. Besides that, food was good, and it was a unique experience."

When you're thinking of visiting a cenote, this is the one to go to.The guides know everything there is to know about cenotes and the history of them.The equipment needed is provided at Rio Secreto. Also, the transportation from the entrance to the actual cenote is included.There are different routes which are not difficult to go through. If there are any obstacles on your way, your guide will tell you and point it out. If you do experience any trouble, he or she will help you.A photographer will also join you on your experience and take some nice pictures of you and your group. To take a single picture is, in my opinion, very expensive. This costs 25 dollars. When you take the whole package, it becomes a better deal, but hey, not everyone looks good in every picture... This is maybe something they should look into, lowering the price per photo.After your tour, you can enjoy a nice Mexican liquor and get a lunch afterwards. Any drinks you want to get (besides water and... Apple juice or ice tea or something that looks and tastes like that) you have to pay for though.This is a nice way to fill up your day and a unique experience.It's one of the first excursions I would recommend."

It was an all day excursion because getting from the ship to rio secreto took some time (40 minute boat ride then another 25 minutes by minibus). Don't be discouraged by this. It was well worth the time and effort. Our guide was Gonzo. If you can get him as your guide you are very lucky. He was so knowledgable about the caves and underground rivers and made it so interesting and fun. The tour in the caves is about 1 1/2 hours. It is a once in a lifetime experience. The tour is about $109/pp and it included a buffet meal afterwards. The facilities are clean and they provide you with what you need. The only negative is that you cannot bring your own camera which is understandable. They have their own photographer and you can purchase your pictures at the end. I felt they were a little overpriced but it helps to keep the place running so we bought them anyway. Overall, I would recommend this to most but not young children (8 and under). Request Gonzo if you can!!"

Still, if you are fine with spending money (which you probably are if you are in this area), this tour will be worth it. Our guide was great, they picked us up from our hotel, provided us with all the equipment needed, and even fed us a tasty meal afterwards.

My host highly recommended the Rio Secreto so I decided to visit with my 10 year old. The tour was amazing. The guides were efficient and prices were reasonable (between me and my daughter it was $100, combined). The entire visit took 4 hours, which includes about 60 minutes of prep and travel, 90 hours of time spent in the cave and underground river, and another 90 minutes for changing and lunch. Our guide Alina was really amazing. She was very professional and always made sure that safety came first. Half of our group were children under 10 and at no time did we feel unsafe, even though we were in a river deep underground. Even swimming in water as deep as 3-4 meters the kids had a great time. The only negative aspect of the trip was the cost of the photos. They don't allow any camera or video taping except through the tour's own camera person. The photo CD came out to $79 USD, which I thought was a bit pricey for 25-30 digital photos. But over all the tour and the food is a great value for a family outing."

We were picked up from our hotel having booked this online whilst we were in Mexico (worth booking direct online rather though your hotel rep as it works out quite a bit cheaper). The day started by being greeted by friendly staff and a quick video about the Cenotes and caves. It's then a short drive into the jungle to the Cenotes site. You are then kitted out with wet suit, shoes and helmet. We were in a small group of 6. Our guide was great, really enthusiastic and obviously keen for us all to have a great time. A short walk through the jungle brought us to the entrance of the sink hole and we descended. What came next absolutely blew me away! The cave system is absolutely awe inspiring,beautiful and captivating. The combination of walking, wading and swimming through the caves was really exciting, and all the while the guide was reassuring and telling us fascinating facts about the cave system its formation, the wildlife etc. we were below ground for over an hour and it whipped by. I was truly captivated and loved every minute and was gutted when the experience came to an end. A short walk back through the jungle and a reasonable lunch awaited us. The caves are an unforgettable experience. The only gripe would be the price of the photos, you cannot take cameras into the caves understandably but your accompanied by a photographer, they have capitalised on this and the photos although not bad are too expensive, working out at about \u00a340 for a cd of around 30 photos. A shame, we would be happy to buy photos but not at that price. We walked away with no photos but great memories of the day"

The tour guide was very knowledgeable, however, started explaining things before everyone in the group were together. He was from France and spoke fairly good English, but had to really listen closely in order to process all information given. You are given hard hats with lights on them (otherwise caves are dark)-- guide has flashlight also. I found myself looking at my feet so as not to fall with the uneven ground and only looked around when standing still, so I probably missed out on a lot of cool formations. You are not allowed to take your own cameras- even if they are waterproof -- they have a photographer assigned to each group to take pictures along the way -- my guess is this is so they can make additional monies on selling overpriced CD photos. It was an enjoyable adventure, however was not a WOW adventure or a \"must see\" for me."

Food was incredibly mediocre and they want you to buy your pictures. The guide was great. So passionate about his job and a pleasure to be around. Don't go on the bilingual tour, if you can avoid it. It wasn't terrible, but it could have been better. My real beef is with the gear. It is doused in bleach. It stinks of bleach and mildew. I thought it was just stinky after being cleaned with bleach - it isn't. They make a big deal about keeping the water free from environmental pollutants and make you shower first, but send you in the water in wetsuits and life vests absolutely dripping with bleach. After turning in the gear and drying off, I threw my clothes on over a slightly damp swimsuit. When I got back, the bleach had seeped from my damp suit and had ruined my clothes. Bathing suit, shirt, and shorts are completely bleach stained and ruined. Not cool. We spent $160 US, plus taxi ride there and back (another $400 pesos), plus tip. Add the cost of my ruined clothes and it just wasn't worth it. To top it off, there was no warning whatsoever, so those with sensitive skin or who like their clothes, beware."

The operation is extremely well organized, including the ability to get picked up at your hotel or condo even if it is a bit out of the way. Equipment ( shorty wetsuit, life jacket, water shoes and helmet with lamp) is provided at no extra cost, and a quick shower is requested to minimize chemicals from bodies and hair getting into the water. Lockers are also provided. Once you are in the caves, you never see another group, which is extremely nice. The tour itself if very informative and fun.

            "review": "Amazing!. As with any travel aboard I was a bit hesitant to book this but since our cruise company recommended it, I didn't see how I could go wrong and boy am I glad I did! It is a pricey excursion but it is well worth it! I had read posts on it and thought well many are recommending it, it must be good and it was. I was with a 10 year and thought she wouldn't enjoy it but she did and that was just the icing on the cake. I always like to go on vacations that leave her with a memory of a lifetime and this was certainly accomplished with this trip. They do not let you bring cameras into the cave system, even if they are waterproof. They do take pictures from the beginning of the tour and all awhile you're in the cave but you guessed it, you have to pay for them. The CD they sell is worth the price because you can take something back with you. Be prepared to get wet and be in tight and dark quarters but it won't matter because it'll be a great time. They do provide you food at the end of the tour, a buffet type which was pretty descent. if you're going from a cruise liner, eat a descent breakfast on the ship and you should be good. Best experience in Playa del Carmen!"

Rio Secreto specializes in preservation, whereas other companies have used dynamite to make it easily accessible for tourists to visit while damaging the natural caves.Most hotels can book this trip for you, but if you book directly you can usually find a discount. There on-line customer service/chat feature was EXCELLENT!!!!They require you t arrive 30 minutes prior to complete paperwork and watch the orientation video. Since there are people from all over the world that visit, we had to watch the video 3 times in 3 different languages. After we were shuffled into the shuttles that take you about 20 minutes away to the cenote.You will be greeted by your tour guide who will get you set up with a locker, water shoes, an outdoor group shower, wetsuit, life jacket and helmet. The wetsuits and other gear are very wet and very smelly. (They get one dip is some kind of cleaning solution when you turn them in, but they still smell of sweat and mold). Also it recommends wearing a bathing suit underneath, I actually recommend wearing a rashguard/neoprene shirt as I actually got a rash from the wetsuit where my bare back made contact with the not so clean wetsuit.After gearing up they take you on a 5 minute hike to the cenote. The underwater caves are beautiful and breathtaking. We were on a bilingual tour, which if I ever come back, I will request a non-bilingual trip. He has to say everything twice and it takes twice as long, now this wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't rushing us along. If you fall more than a couple of steps behind, the guide will yell at you, so just try to hurry along and stay with the group, even though you are trying not slip and fall or run into the rocks underwater. Also for some reason our guide had 3 English speaking people in the front of the line, 4 French, and then us 2 English speaking people in the back, so while walking in line, he would speak to the English speakers, but we were way in the back and had not reached the stopping points yet, so we couldn't hear what he was saying. Then he would translate to French for the French people, and we would never understand what he saying.They will not let you bring in your own camera, even if it is waterproof, one it would really hold up the group and two, they want to charge you $79 (yes, that is US dollars, not pesos) for the photographs they take, yes, that was more than the admission price!!!!Lunch is provided, it was a variety of Mexican dishes/buffet, it was okay at best.After lunch we had a whole 5 minutes to chill in the hammocks, before they herded us back into the shuttle to head back to the check in area.This tour does offer three different tours, so you can revisit and take another route.I was not very fond of the tour guide or the tour itself as were seemed to be rushed, but I would return to these caves because they are amazing and beautiful; however, I might consider a different tour company."

By the time you finish the tour and eat there is little to no time before you are back in the van and going back home. The food is ok at best. I would have rather gone back to the hotel once we finished with the tour but that is not how they operate. The caves were cool to see and cool to the touch. The helmet is definitely needed b/c there are plenty of opportunities for you to hit your head and the wet suit feels great when floating in the river. It is quite cool. Loved it!!!"

Where else can you submerse yourself in 2million year old surroundings. Rodolfo our French guide was very informative, our group was half English and half French and he made it understandable for all of us. If you are claustrophobic this is not for you. The clear water, the caves, the stalagmites, the stalagtites.....breathtaking. You cant bring a camera, which I was a little disappointed as I had a waterproof one just for that excursion, but you dont have time/focus to take photos. You have a \"paparazzi\" who takes plenty of individual/couple (make sure you smile :)) and you purchase at the end of the tour for $75USD, they give you a hardcopy disc. Well worth it and takes the pressure off. We brought our own water shoes which I recommend as you will have to rent theirs. And not a skimpy swimsuit as you'll be in a wetsuit anyway. Water was perfectly cool, nice for the hot weather up above. I would say we were down there for an hour and a half? Totally lost track of time. I would absolutely do this again as there are 3 different routes. The lunch after was also quite yummy, soup, chicken, tamales, rice, green beans. Water and Jamaica drinks included. Even the tour bus driver was entertaining and gave great information about the towns we drove through while dropping other guests off at their hotels. Plan on this taking up most of the day, the front desk said we'd be back by 12:30pm and we didnt get back until 4:15pm. Cant wait to go back one day."

You receive all the \"gear\" you need including water shoes, a wetsuit, a lifejacket, and a helmet with headlamp. You can even select a walking stick to use (a must). The guide was excellent and very informative. We came with a group of 50, but they split us up into smaller groups of 10 persons. There are actually several different trails you can take once inside the cave so you could come back several times with different experiences each time. You will get to walk through the cave, wade through the river, and even swim (float) in some parts of the secret river. Everywhere you look it is amazing with stalactites and stalagmites and other formations everywhere!The only down side to this is stated by others before and that is you cannot (due to safety) take your own camera inside. There is a Rio Secreto photographer that follows your group everywhere and will take pictures during the exploration. Afterwards, they will show you all the photos and try to sell them to you- 1 photo for $25 or all of them for $79. It is expensive, but a decision you have to make.There is a small buffet at the end after changing clothes of rice, beans, chicken, chips, salsa, fruit, water, etc. Drinks are extra if you want them. While waiting to return to hotel or cruise, there are lots of nice and comfortable hammocks to rest in- use them!There was also a small shuttle van that took us to and from Rio Secreto with excellent drivers. Overall, I would definitely go again. Enjoy Rio Secreto!"

The ride lasted about 45 minutes and then we were driven by van to the Amazing Secret River entrance. We were fitted with wetsuits and helmets and headed through a small hike to the cave entrance. The cave itself was beyond beautiful, and our guide, Nunes, was very knowledgeable and fun. The whole tour lasted about an hour and a half. We celebrated after exiting with a shot of anise liquor and then enjoyed a delicious Mexican buffet. We weren't allowed to bring our own cameras and the photos taken by another guide cost $25 a piece, or $79 for a full CD. After returning to the Playa Del Carmen port, we had 40 minutes to shop while waiting for the boat to return us to Cozumel. Honestly, this was a huge disappointment. We would have much rather spent that 40 minutes in Cozumel shopping. The boat returning us to Cozumel left us with no time to souvenir shop as all the port stores had closed and we were rushed to our cruise ship for departure. We enjoyed the tour but probably won't do it again."

Swimming through the underground river and witness the formation of the cave, fish and bats is something out of this world. I highly recommend it to whoever interested in the wild life and explorers. Note: It is not recommended to people who has walking problems, little children and those who suffers from the clautrophobia.

Throughout the entire 1.5 hr tour, he helped us scale each area and obstacle while keeping up with his enjoyable guided tour. From moment one, he truly made us feel like we were his first and last tour ever. Definitely the VIP treatment. I recommend that you have good balance because there are portions of the the tour that require stability climbing on and over rock formations without the aid of holding on at some portions. Thankfully they outfit you with helmets and aqua shoes. AND REMEMBER AS NIKO SAID, \"THE WATER IS \"REFRESHING\".\" While the photos are nice, the option to bring in your own waterproof camera should be an option. The pictures are pretty decent but the price can be steep so be prepared in advance ($50+) for a photo CD.  The ride to the Rio Secreto can be a little \"bumpy\" through the dirt paths but it's well worth the journey at the end. As our driver called the ride, a \"Mayan Massage\". It definitely is one so don't eat a heavy meal before or afterward. Overall, a 5 star experience. Definitely one not to miss!Thanks again to Niko for an amazing day in the caves of Rio Secreto on the Yucatan Peninsula!"

There are portions where you swim/glide through the deeper waters and there are bats, a few fish and many stalactite and stalagmite formations. One of the best moments in the tour is when we turned off our headlamps and let the feeling of absolute darkness sink in. The lunch at the end of the tour was hot and good local faire. Our tour guide, Galo, was very knowledgeable and caring to ensure every tourist felt safe and was getting the full experience, He went above and beyond his daily duties to take are of everyone making sure they had the right equipment, plenty of food and extras while our group waited for the rest of our bus to complete their tour."

Our trip far exceeded any of our expectations! We were warmly greeted by staff and taken to put on wetsuits and gear. Our group was split into two and my 86 year old Grandma was in one group and my five year old cousin was in another so the guides would be able to assist them both separately. Jorge was our guide and his knowledge and passion for the caves shined through the entire tour. We could tell he loved what he did and truly cared about preserving this beautiful cave. I have traveled the world, and Rio Secreto was by far one of the best side trips I have ever taken. The beauty and tranquility that lies within the cave is absolutely breathtaking and anyone that is considering this tour, should do it...you will not regret it! The swimming was great and at times over our heads, which was so cool (life jackets are worn)!! When taking this tour, make sure you stop and look at all around you and realize how old this underground world is. The only light on the tour is from the helmets worn, which is plenty when you're in the cave. I found myself looking all around and amazed at all of the spots Jorge took us through! While cameras are not allowed on the tour, there is a photographer that captures pictures along the way...yes, the pictures are expensive, but then again, how often do you have the opportunity to swim in a cave? We purchased the pictures on a disc and are so glad that we did. My 86 year old Grandma became nervous when she entered the cave, but Jorge assisted her the ENTIRE time. He was AMAZING with her and helped her feel safe and she had a FANTASTIC time!! If it weren't for his thoughtful assistance, she would have had a difficult time on the tour, but Jorge was great. Rio Secreto is a world wonder and should not be missed when visiting Riviera Maya."

            "review": "It's a cavern.... Having a good experience visiting a site heavily depends on 3 main factors:Your interests, your expectations, and who you're with. I wasn't overly impressed with this site, but I kept my opinion to myself as I observed that the group I was in, as well as 2 groups who had already finished the tour before us, were raving about it. So here are my thoughts to help you decide for yourself. PROs:- this is a good cavern tour. Whether or not you go as an individual or in a tour group, the tour provides an on-site guide and high quality equipment (wetsuit, watershoes, helmet with lamp)-Tours are offered in English or Spanish (separate groups saves the time of translating)-groups are limited to around 7 people -The guide explains all about stalagtites, stalagmites, and the importance of the caverns in nature and to the Mayans- you walk through underground caverns and wade through water up to neck deep. It is dark and you must pick your way through carefully. For me, this was a plus. More adventurous. However, if you are older or not sure-footed, this is not the tour for you. (See cons)- a simple buffet meal is included at the end of the tour. I thought the food was good.CONS:- I thought it was pricey for a cavern tour.Walk-in entrance is $80 US, but you have to factor in the guide, meal, and equipment.  But I've been on a few cavern tours, so if you haven't, you'll really enjoy this one. - The tour can be challenging for those who are older, don't see well, or have any walking or balance issues. There are steep staircases, rocky inclines with dirt and gravel, slippery and rocky cavern floors with irregular rock formations jutting out of and under the milky cavern water. A woman in her late 60s was having trouble negotiating the trek and was quite winded on the return. The tour is doable for everyone. Kids will have few problems. The guide can help those who are having difficulty, in - or out of - the water. But you should know what you're getting into. What is fun for some can be intimidating for others. - I thought the tour inside the cavern was kinda brief. It's 3.5 hours, but about the first 15 min is spent driving to the starting point, then 30-45 min changing and putting on wetsuits and equipment, and then 30 min at the end taking OFF said equipment and changing, and another 30+ minutes at the end, eating. That leaves about 30-45 minutes actually inside the cavern. - There are no pictures or video allowed. You can buy a package of professional-quality photos they take inside the cavern, but of course, they're expensive. $80 US. I was thinking of buying them, so I purposely staged several pics that the photographer got a big kick out of, yet when I was looking through the photos at the end, only a few of them were included. I didn't buy the package. If one of my pics shows up on their next brochure, I will epitomize the typical American and sue. (At least for the cost of my admission). To sum up, I thought it was a decent cavern tour considering the quality of the equipment, etc. I was a bit disillusioned by the reference to the site as a cenote. While it IS a cenote, there is no swimming involved. It's a shallow-water walking tour. So for me, it was about expectations. But you decide. Hope this helps. Happy travels!  "

It was amazing walking, swimming, and treading water in the dark cave with our headlights on. After the tour there was a buffet waiting and it was pretty good. Highly recommended !"

From there we took a 25 minute van ride to the location. The last 10-15 minutes of the ride was very bumpy due to unpaved roads but no biggie! The facilities are very clean and nice. The caves are amazing, so beautiful and interesting. Best of all was our tour guide CARLOS! He was friendly, knowledgable, funny, and helpful! Thank you Carlos for making it a memorable day!You need cash for pictures. $25 for one on a CD, $75 for CD with all pictures taken during your time in the cave plus additional professional pictures of the caves, or $100 for CD with your choice of souvenirs."

Logistically, the tour begins with a 10 minute informational video, then a 5 minute van ride into the jungle to another location where you shower and are fitted with equipment. Even though they tried to squeeze my size 10 (US) body into an XS wetsuit (which was never gonna happen) they had a suit for me and even my husband who is a US size 52 suit (all shoulders!).The trek underground is at least an hour long and mostly wading through 3 feet or so of water. There were 2 spots that required some level of swimming or at least using your arms to paddle while the life jacket keeps you afloat for 10-20 feet. You definitely feel like you're on an adventure! They also serve a decent meal after the tour that included soup, chicken pibil, rice, beans, salad, fruit and drinks. A nice bonus and welcomed after all that trekking through the jungle, trying to swim with a lifejacket and trying to stay upright while walking over rocks in the water. There was a Mexican woman in our group who was doing this tour for the 3rd time and I can see why. There are apparently different paths and levels of difficulty. I would go again."

He recommended Rio Secreto, and I could not be more grateful that he did!! It is a tour of the underground rivers! They ask you to take nothing with you that could contaminate the water, and no sunscreen! Won't need it! Wear a bathing suit/water clothes. They suit you up in a wet suit, water shoes, a life jacket and a hardhat with a headlamp. The shaman purifies you in a ceremony before you enter the cenote. Your guide leads your group through the caves, pointing out beautiful features and history. In some spots, the water is only ankle deep, in some places you swim through, in still others, you need to push yourself through small openings on your back (not for the claustrophobic!). They have a photographer who moves with your group and takes photos you can purchase at the end. This was an amazing experience our whole family enjoyed and still talks about with excitement!"

We were split into small groups of ten and our group was guided by Carlos. He did a wonderful job of guiding us safely through the caverns and river while providing much commentary and insight during the tour. Carlos made sure everyone was taken care of while we ventured on the most difficult of the three available tours. It truly was an amazing experience to see the magnificent stalactites and stalagmites forming. We would have liked to have taken photos but we understand why it isn't allowed. With this in mind, bring money - $25 for a single photo, $99+ for packages including souvenirs. We gave the photo staff member our email but he never emailed info to us. My husband contacted Rio Secreto and Ramon Hernandez set up a PayPal request so that we could receive all of our photos and the Rio Secreto Galleria of photos. Ramon was of great assistance!We all agreed it was the best excursion experience which also included a very tasty Mayan lunch. We highly recommend this tour!!"

This was a cruise excursion for my daughters and I (ages 13 and 10) who I figured might like something more along the lines of \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\". I nailed it with this choice, even though beaches and sun are more of our thing.Still, you'll swim. Not the whole way, but definitely at certain points. At other points it's wading, and sometimes walking. And, without our lights, it would be totally dark. This might be frightening for a very small child. Also, if an individual has ambulatory difficulties, it might not be entirely comfortable walking over rocky and wet places. But, all of that is what makes it a cool and interesting experience! DEFINITELY more exciting than the great Luray Caverns in Virginia, or even the many beautiful caves in southwest Australia!You'll wear (and you need to) a shorty wet-suit, and hard-had with light. This is your chance to experience caves that were only relatively recently discovered, and not quite established old tourist sites. On that note, I've got to say that this excursion edged out the other stops on our Disney cruise for one big reason: Groups are taken in relatively small numbers, and you're not so much another body in a parade of cattle. It made the experience much more memorable.Also, the buffet at the end was great! More like eating authentic Mexican food than what most Americans experience."

We ended up splitting it with our group (one person took the disk and sent dropbox links to everyone) for $100 total so $10/person. One note- the drive there is quite bumpy so if you get motion sickness be aware! You turn off the main road and think you are there but there is still a 30 minute drive on a very bumpy dirt road ahead of you!"

It's a beautiful site, the guides are very dedicated and knowledgeable, there are several different cave paths, so you can go back many times and see different areas, and the food is actually really good. We had a blast! I would say using the provided walking stick (optional) was actually very helpful. I usually don't like to carry things around with me needlessly, but I was thankful I took one.

You will be travelling by bus in a foreign country, so keep in mind that road rules are almost non existent, but as long as you have an adventurous spirit you will be fine. Our bus driver was obviously experienced and I wasn't nervous at all. The second part of the bus ride is just as others have mentioned, it is very bumpy but we found it only enhanced the adventure. Once we got to Rio Secreto we were met by our guide Gonzo and he was FANTASTIC. He was very knowledgeable, funny and obviously passionate about his job and his heritage. He explained all of the rules first, and no, you are not allowed to take cameras, but despite what others have said, it is not so that you will be forced to buy the photos they take throughout the tour, it is because you will need both hands at all time to maneuver through the caves. The caves and river were mind blowing. Gonzo took the time to explain the formations, how each of them came to be and even gave us approximate ages for some of them. He explained the water and why it is so clear and even how the water travels to the caves, and then from the caves to the ocean. Gonzo also spoke with us about the ancient Mayan's and their attachment to the cave systems. The tour itself is about an hour and a half, and you will spend about 60% of your time in water of varying depths. This tour requires some physical exertion and you need to be steady on your feet and not afraid of enclosed spaces. Lunch afterwards is fantastic. It is authentic, flavorful and they let you go back for seconds - and you will because it is just that good. Beware of the 'green sauce' it is hotter than anything you can imagine. Even though Gonzo warned us, a couple in our group tried it and were unable to communicate for a good little while :o). This was by far the most outstanding part of our entire vacation and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a big adventure and something they will remember for the rest of their lives. Thank you Rio Secreto and a huge thank you go Gonzo! Russ and Taryn."

Inside of the caves there was a lot to discover. We enjoyed the beautiful views of the cave, the floating in the clear water and all the interesting details about the flora and fauna of the caves. Nico gave us a very detailed explanation of everything and answered all our questions. After our one and a half hour tour we walked back to the starting point, where a delicious local lunch was waiting for us. Of course we bought all the nice pictures as a souvenir and if we come back to Cancun, this tour would be definitely something we would love to do again, since there are five different caves to discover."

Throughout the entire trip this is the only time I witnessed real care and preservation efforts by staff of their natural treasure/tourist attraction. Please be advised that they ask you to take of your sunblock and ensure that the cenote system has the least bit of foreign impurities introduced into it, therefore you will see no automated vehicles going through here and that is how it should be. I am very happy we went, the trip was suggested by my parents and I thought it would be an after note to all our other excursions, I was wrong. This one was a highlight and some of the other trips we have done included chichen itza, coba, tulum, snorkling and horseback riding. The guide was very informative and ensured we had a great time on our 2hr tour. Our safety and comfort was always emphasized. Only one downside: no cameras. I was absolutely ok with this, however I believe that if the prices of the photos were lower, more people would actually purchase at least one photograph. The absurdly high price of $25/one photo was a little too much for us especially since we were at the end of our trip and were running low on spending cash. Too bad though we def would have liked one. I think that $15/photo would have earned the operation far more in the end just because its within a more reasonable price range for visitors. Also in Mexico a lot of tourist attractions try to gouge tourists, at the end of a trip it gets harder to justify $25 for just one photo. Sorry guys, I really wanted to support you some more but couldn't. Final Verdict: A must see especially since these cave systems are very unique to this part of the world. Better to support this one than others because they put nature first and that way maybe even your great-grandkids may even get to see it some day."

A natural underground cathedral, where Mayan priests went for oracles and sacred ceremonies.Our knowledgeable and professional guide, Pablo, seemed to enjoy the tour just as we all did, a true believer in his role and in the history of the caves and culture. He led us safely through rocks and water, showing us the way and counting heads (helmets) as we proceeded through the most difficult passages... A professional photographer came along with us, and had us pose in the different environments and atmosphere.My personal experience became a spiritual one, as I went further into the bowels of the Earth. I felt like a child in the womb of our Mother, safe and cared for, as I slowly made my way out in the open world. The climax of this journey happened when Pablo had us shut all lights out. We stayed in meditation in the absolute wet darkness of the womb, hearing only our own breath, heart-beat, and the water dripping down along the stalactites and into the crystal-clear pools...Once back into the green of the jungle, we were taken to the center in order to get rid of our specific equipment used during our trek. A tasty, traditional Mayan buffet was ready for us to enjoy, after having toasted with the rest of our group and guide with an herbal shot.Transportation to and from the site was well coordinated, comfortable and on time. All in all, a fantastic moment in our life, we will cherish forever."

I really don't understand some of the negative reviews I saw regarding the conditions of the Cenote. Yes, the terrain is untouched and has a lot of undulation, but since there's no light, it's not slippery. Yeah, we bumped into rocks, but to me, that is part of the expectation. I would be disappointed if we walked through it like an amusement park. We never felt we were in any \"danger\" and the terrain was very negotiable. You just have to be careful. We didn't use the walking sticks offered and are very glad we didn't. I feel like that would have been more of a hastle than help. I also read about negativity regarding pictures. Again, I would expect that to be part of the expectations. I never felt like it was a nuisance and was very happy they took pictures. And the price for the pictures is high, but that's the case with every excursion in Riviera Maya we took part in. That's just part of it. I'm glad we bought the CD because those are memories I never want to forget. I would go back time and time again. The tour guide (my apologies, as his name slips my mind) was fantastic. I learned a lot about Cenotes and it was apparent he really enjoyed what he was doing. Not being a fan of Mexican food, I can't comment on the quality of the food, but my wife seemed to enjoy it. One additional comment: the guides split our group up into English and Spanish groups, which I thought was outstanding customer service. We went on other excursions where they were combined and trying to understand the guide was very difficult. All in all, I am so happy I decided to go, because this is an experience I will never forget."

Unfortunately our experience wasn't as great as everyone else. We did the before noon tour. Our resort Best Day representative advised us that this was a 3 hour excursion. All in all it was 6 hours. The best day driver was late in picking us up. Then we proceeded to drive through downtown playa del carmen for 20 minutes to pick up more people. When we got to their resort they were not there and seemed that the driver made the mistake. Once we got to Rio Secreto we sat in a waiting area for about 45 minutes waiting for more people to be dropped off. Then we spent another 15 minutes watching their video in three languages. The whole trip was disorganized. They told us which tour guide we were going with and then they kept changing it on everyone. Then you pile into a bus and drive thru 7 kilometers of terrible dirt roads. Once you get to the location and head in it was pretty cool. We had never done anything like this before. NOTE: they don't allow you to take a camera even though it may be water proof so they can sell you an overpriced picture disc. The tour through the cenote is definitely a cool experience. Our tour guide Julian was great. You stop several times so the photographer can take photos. They were very serious about not allowing you to touch anything in the cave. Make no mistake, there are no lights in the cave, you have headlamps to guide you. You spend about an hour and a half in the cave. Very minimal swimming. Then you go to the photo place where your options are $70 for maybe 10 photos of you, $100 for the photos and a t-shirt. Way over priced. Then you proceed to get some food and wait around til your ride picks you up to back to your hotel. The whole tour was disorganized and very pricey."

He was very funny too. His english was excellent and he spoke french very well to accommodate one of the couples that was part of the group.I would recommend this tour as it's truly not something you see everyday or ever read about. The natural water is also very refreshing. I would have given this tour an excellent rating but the driver who drove us back to the resort at the end of the tour was completely lost and had to stop several times and ask people for directions. It ended up taking us 2 hours to get back to the resort compared to the 45 minutes it took to get their in the morning. Hopefully, you have a better driver.Lastly, we would have liked to buy some of the photos but found they were incredibly expensive based on the quality. If you want photos your looking at 30 USD to 100 USD depending on how many you want. Pretty sure they would get more business if they lowered this cost."

My husband and I are both outdoors people and love to explore. The only thing that could've been better is if the tour laster longer! I could have explored all day. Only issue is trying to contact someone at Rio Secreto regarding souveniors. We didn't really get time to purchase them at the tour and was told we could for up to two months. I can't seem to get anyone to contact me. Even though the souveniors are priced high, remember the money goes toward helping to perserve the cave.....so consider it as a donation!"

Don't get me wrong, this was a great experience and one of a kind and definitely worth witnessing once in your life. It could have been that I've seen these types of caves in Bermuda, so I knew what I was getting into, but I wasn't blown away. Still, this experience is pretty cool. Being able to swim in the cave was awesome and you're really more walking/treading than you are swimming. You don't need to know how to swim to do this excursion. Our tour guide Luis was awesome and the whole team is professional and very helpful. They provide water shoes and a wet suit and after the tour you get lunch which was pretty good. Lockers are free as well. If you've seen the caves before and you're on the fence with this, I'd pass, but if you've never seen anything like this, you definitely have to check it out. You're on vacation, splurge a little!"

The cave is stunning, and comprises of countless stalactites and stalagmites. Very tasty lunch afterwards, lovely jungle feel to the site. The only complaint is that the pictures are 25$ US for a single cd-rom of a single picture taken on the trip through the caves. The rest of the packages range up to about 100$ (don't quite recall), but it seems excessive considering they give you only a digital copy. Highly recommend, but be prepared to spend money if you want to keep a picture."

We had read that finding this place on our own was difficult, so we arranged them pick us up from our resort. We prepaid with paypal and were able to save 10%. I believe we paid 50 each. The road through the jungle is very rough so if you have car sickness issues might want to take something prior.  You need to bring your own bathingsuit and bring money for pictures just incase you decide you want them. You can't take your own camera or water camera but they have a \"professional\" taking pictures which they sell for 70 US plus money to tip your guide. The pictures are pricey but I decided to buy them. Our photographer was just ok .. didn't take alot or do anything very interesting but wanted some pics of this once in a lifetime adventure. Our guide , Julio, was excellent!!! He met with our group and got us set up with Wetsuits, helmets with lights, water shoes and lockers. They broke us up in groups by what language we spoke. We were told the groups would be no more than 10. Julio was very patient and informative. We felt safe at all times. They will offer you walking sticks ... everyone should take one. The tour is difficult walking and the stick will be a big help. Before entering you are \"blessed\" by a Mayan preist which we found somewhat offensive. This cenote is magnificent and worth the effort and expense. We had went to several other cenotes but I dare say there isn't one to match this one. The meal they provide ... well I decided to wait to get back to our luxury resort. We did drink the water /koolaid they had to drink and we both got Ill so i would bring your own bottles of water and stick to that. There were all ages and physical abilities on this tour .. though it was challenging ... YOU CAN DO THIS and you will be glad you did."

Rio Secreto is an amazing underground river in caves filled with stalagmites and stalactites.This is an exceptionally well organized excersion, including the round trip transfers, drive to the area, outfitting you with the water shoes, short wetsuits, life jacket and helmet with light. You will feel silly putting on the gear, but it is all well worth it as certain areas of the caves are rocky and slippery, and it's super to have the life jacket during the swim sections as you can just float over to the next chamber. There were 6 or 7 of us in each group and we were divided into 3 groups. Our guide was Victor and he was super, knowledgeable and friendly and careful. You may feel having the photographer is a \"money making spin\" and it may be, but at the end it is lovely to have a momento of the trip, and you have the option to buy just one photo for $25, the whole disc for $69 or an entire package for $99 including a bottle of some lovely syrupy anise flavored local Mayan alcohol, of which you get to taste after the tour, before lunch.Lunch is buffet style and there is plenty to eat, ice tea and fresh water are provided or you can pay $2 for bottled water or sodas. It's about 4 hours, because of the van rides there and back, and lunch. I think well worth the time and money."

Ahh, the water. It was SO beautiful. So clear, and clean, and the cave was breathtaking. We went through in a group of nine, which was just the perfect size- enough helmet lights so that it did not feel claustrophobic, but a small enough group that no one was ever left out and we were able to get answers to any questions. Our guide, Jorge, was FANTASTIC. Absolutely awesome. Funny, patient, enthusiastic, and very obviously passionate about his job and the cave itself.

The tour took us through creaks and cervices as tour guide explained stalactites and stalagmite formation. Some areas were deep and involved a little trek through water. A photographer accompanied group and took many pics along way as you are not allowed to bring anything into river even underwater cameras not allowed. The entire tour was around 1hr after we came out washed off and got a chance to see pictures and purchase if desired and then we enjoyed a nice lunch.

Let's get them out of the way first. If you are planning this as part of a cruise excursion and your ship docks in Cozumel, be prepared for a long journey of tendering and driving with a crowd of fellow travelers. They provide all the gear, but the life jackets and wet suits are cold, damp, and smelly. If you have your own wet suit, bring it. If you don't mind cool water, pass. Even the helmets smell. I realize this is probably hard to avoid, but it was still nasty.Now for the actual adventure. Our guide was Alfredo. I have never met anyone more passionate about his job. I doubt he even calls it a job - his joy for what he does and the Rio Secreto is palpable. We knew, before even entering the cave, that we were going to experience something amazing, and we truly did. Once I was inside, I forgot about the travel time, and the stink of my gear. The cave was beautiful. Alfredo was very knowledgeable about the cave and river and was able to answer all of our questions.You really don't need to know how to swim to enjoy this adventure (you have on a life jacket), but be prepared to climb, duck, and squeeze through some tight and tricky areas. Fortunately, Alfredo made sure that we were all safe, and pointed out any areas that required a bit of extra precaution. After the tour, a lunch buffet was provided. The food was decent, nothing spectacular, but it was included in the cost of the excursion, so that was nice. I highly recommend visiting Rio Secreto, even with the few cons that I mentioned. Don't let those minor nuisances keep you from experiencing this amazing destination."

I was worth taking the ferry over to Playa and a quick collectivo down the highway. It lives up to the billing. This tour is not rushed, so take it all in. Mauricio was the guide for the group and was informative and generous with his time. Moved the group well but not fast. Be prepared, it's not a stroll down a sandy beach. Plenty of climbing, a little swimming and lots to see. At first, I admit, that the rules of NO cameras was a disappointment, but once taken, I understand why. I'm not sure that I would have made it through with my underwater camera without breaking it myself. And if they stopped every time for a person to take a pic, it would take away from the experience. The CD of pix taken by the cameraman alongside us was a bit expensive, but after the fact worth it. Decent buffet at the end and plenty of time to relax. You won't see caves like this anywhere. And to think the Mayans did these without flashlights and mapping is astounding..."

On Apr 14th/'14, another couple and ourselves, despite a bad back and 3 bad knees between us decided to do an adventure that didn't involve leaving early and getting home late. As we were staying a short distance from Playa Del Carmen, another plus for not having to travel half the day, we signed up with Sunwing Tours at our hotel (also fabulous - Grand Sunset Princess). Everything was first class and nothing left to chance as ALL the equipment was provided - water shoes, wetsuits, life jackets, helmet and light. Just follow the rules re: showering, jewellery, cameras, etc. and enjoy. Our guide Paulo, was outstanding and obviously very passionate about his role in introducing people to his special obsession. The food afterwards was excellent, the special drink was wonderful and the pictures would have been impossible for anyone other than the professional photographer - definitely worth the fee as the best souvenir you could bring home!

Love the natural atmosphere it really makes one feel like a true explorer. We are a family of six with my youngest being four it was hard to find activities that would satisfy us all. This place nailed it. It is extremely kid friendly and the guides are so informative and they teach you so much about the beautiful caves and underground rivers. Hector was our guide and he is fabulous. They take care of you from the beginning to the end. He was there for all our needs and took really good care of the kids. He even teamed up with our youngest and called him \"the leader\" which made his day. We all felt like we were in national geographic magazine in a place that was unreal. The water is cold but the life jackets are great. They provide you with all the equipment and have sizing for all. The food was great. I would recommend going early the cave seems fresh we were the first group in. Plus you have the rest of the day to go to the beach."

            "review": "Interesting tour of pristine underground rivers (cenotes). My wife and I visited Rio Secreto during a 4-night stay in Cancun in March 2014 for our honeymoon. I was very interested in checking out the Yucatan cenotes and swimming through the refreshing, ground-filtered water. This was one of the only tours that didn't involve adrenaline junkie obstacle courses involving the cenotes. The drawback of the adventure tours for me was that they don't seem to preserve the natural environment as well, exploiting it more to push large numbers of tourists through.Rio Secreto features several guides speaking multiple languages, from English and German, to French, Portuguese and Spanish (of course). Our guide, Mauricio, spoke great English and had a wealth of geological and cultural knowledge of the environment, including how the cenotes were formed, how they're affected by human interaction, and how the Mayans incorporate them into their culture. We had a few older people in our small group (8-10 people per guide) and he ensured their safety throughout.The terrain is rough and rocky underwater, involving some stepping (i.e., staggering) and some swimming (while wearing rubber-soled water shoes). It's pitch black in most places, so you wear headlamps (along with wetsuits because the water is chilly). The guide has an underwater flashlight to cast excellent lighting on some phenomenal rock formations and showcasing some great colors.The tour includes individual/couple and group photos throughout - available for purchase afterward. The price of all 75 photos was about $70 but worth it. It's not possible - nor would it be easy - to take photos in the underground environment. So it's nice to have a professional taking high quality shots from angles only they would know through experience.The tour wraps up with a really nice buffet lunch. It's casual but tasty and authentic Yucatan-style food.We got transportation to/from our Cancun hotel and the driver was prompt both there and back.Overall, the tour is highly recommended, especially for people looking for a more relaxing immersion in the cenotes. My only complaint is that the tour territory doesn't involve more lengthy swimming/floating."

The road to the caves is not a problem at all and the walk to and from the cave entrances are easy even for us older, less mobile types.

This is absolutely an experience not to be missed. From the moment we arrived at the reception area Jesus made us feel welcome and answered all our questions. Once we met our guide Paolo we were outfitted and taken excellent care of. Paolo absolutely made this the best experience. His knowledge and attention to us made it doable and enjoyable."

Boy were we glad we did!From the minute we stepped off the ship in Cozumel, Angel and Tomas were there to get us on the ferry to Playa del Carmen and then on the minivans to this amazing hideaway in the jungle! It was a little bit bumpy once we got off the highway but I was already armed with Dramamine from the cruise and ferry ride so it was all good. Once we arrived, our already small tour group of 22 was further broken down to 8 and assigned to Rodrigo as our guide. He seemed rushed at first, while getting us suited up in our wetsuits, water shoes and helmets (all part of the package), it was easy to see why....he wanted us to have as much time enjoying this incredible experience as he does! Equipped with our walking sticks (when he encourages you to take one...listen!), We headed off on a trail into the jungle and were met by a gentleman who performed a sort of cleansing ritual before heading into the cave. After entering the cave itself, it became so evident that Rodrigo loved his job! He was so enthusiastic about sharing the beauty of what lies underground it made the experience that much more wonderful. The formation of the stalagtites and stalagmites were almost whimsical in some areas and, while they don't allow the guests to bring their own cameras, they do provide a photographer who was with us throughout our journey capturing individual, couple and group shots! The cost of individual photos were pricey so we bit the bullet and got the CD of the entire tour as it made more sense. We did enjoy a shot of something similar to Sambuca with Rodrigo after we emerged...not for the faint of heart! Ha! The \"snack\" as the excursion description told us was more like a full lunch and was delicious! Beware...the green sauce is NOT guacamole but one of the hottest salsas we had ever tried! Not long after lunch, we loaded into our minivan and were taken back to Playa del Carmen. We only had about an hour of free time before we needed to regroup for our ferry ride back to Cozumel and the ship. We would have liked to of had a little more time there but not at the expense if cutting our time with Rodrigo!If you are looking to do something different, spend the day out of the Sun and to see some of the beauty that lies below Mexico, make this a part of your trip! You won't regret it!!"

            "review": "Secreto Best Kept Secreto. We took this tour through Carnival from Cozumel. This was the best excursion we have been on. It takes a while to drive back to the cave which is not very deep. You arrive to a settlement in the middle of the forest. There are restrooms and lockers. You will be issued a wet suit, life jacket and helmet with light. You will need aqua shoes or you can get some there. You can't wear sandals. Because the river is pristine and human contact can destroy that, you will be required to shower off before entering the cave.This cave was considered sacred by the Mayans. Before we entered the cave, a Mayan descendant burned incense and said a blessing. It sounds cheesy but really wasn't.The cave has uneven areas and I strongly suggest that you take one of the walking sticks offered; they come in handy.Pedro was our guide and he was great! He was very passionate about his love of the cave and was very sincere. He ensured that we all stayed together and took good care of us.The water in the cave varies in depth and there are a couple of areas where swimming is required. There are no lights in the cave; the only lights are on the helmets and the guide's flash light and cameras are not allowed. You won't miss not having a camera because they take fantastic photos that you can buy later. Now, for the cave itself...it is beautiful with stalagmites, stalactites and columns galore. There are little blind catfish swimming in the water but I never saw them. However, do not touch them; they are still living and if you touch them, they will stop growing. After the tour, we enjoyed a delicious Mexican meal and sampled a shot of some honey and licorice flavored liquor. Note- be careful of the green sauce,it is hot!"

We were underground for over an hour and a half and unlike other tours we have been on, we never saw or heard another group of people. There are several routes used by the guides so you totally feel alone. Paulo was very educated and passed information along to us and even let the 2 kids hang on him while swimming through the deep water. They have a buffet at the end with what is described as traditional Mayan food and it is wonderful. I would not recommend this tour for anyone that has difficulty walking on uneven ground as this consist of most of the tour along with stooping down and hunching over. I do recommend this tour if you want an adventure and to visit someplace that does not have that \"tourist\" feel. Did I mention that Paulo our guide from Brazil was incredible?"

After swimming in Xplor's underground caverns, I was concerned that Rio Secreto was going to be much of the same thing. This was not the case. Where Xplor and Xcaret caverns have obviously been touched by and modified by humans to cater to the tourists, this was not the case with Rio Secreto.Rio Secreto was a very authentic experience. I liken it to caving with a water component. The cavern we entered appeared to be untouched by humans and was an amazing experience.The ground is quite uneven and there are many rocks and ridges to navigate. You are offered a walking stick prior to entering the caverns and I recommend you take one. You are not allowed to touch the formations even to support yourself. This is where the walking stick was very valuable. As it floats, it was also very easy to swim with.You are given wet suits to wear as well as water shoes. We packed our own water shoes, towels etc, but these were not needed at all. Basically you only need to have your swimwear, dry clothes (the clothes you arrive in are fine + underwear) and your wallet for purchasing the photos if you choose. You are given a locker with a key to put everything in when you arrive. We purchased a disk with all of our photos on it for $69; I personally think it was worth it. The photographer takes quite a few pics while you're down there and he ensures you are positioned to get great shots. You are not allowed to take your own photos in the caves.If you're doing the tour, lunch is served after. Our guide, Alina, was great.If you're afraid of dark spaces, this may not be for you. It is very dark down there, but you are given helmets with lights to help. We enjoyed this experience very much."

I HIGHLY recommend the walking stick, as the floor of the cave is very uneven and the stick helped greatly.Overall just a fantastic experience.

We enjoyed the experience touring underground this past September 26 and were impressed by the various language skills and knowledge of the tour guides. The problem is if you want photos. They have a photographer along with the tour documenting the tour. They then offer the DVD for $69. After viewing the photos, we decided to purchase. They ran the card but their wireless lost connection. So it was run again. They were upfront about it so I knew to look for a duplicate charge. When I got the bill in October, I notified Rio Secreto of the duplicate charge. They requested the statement showing the duplicate which I gladly provided. They replied that they were sending to accounting to return the charge. After that they have been unresponsive so I have had to open a dispute with my credit card company. It appears this is a common problem. My advice, open a cc dispute rather than deal with them on a customer service/business level. That is why the terrible review. Otherwise, I would probably rate average to very good experience, but prices keep it from anything higher."

You can tell he is passionate about the cave and what he does, and is engaging and fun. He sets the tour according to who is on it, physical ability and moving through the cave. Perfect. I'd recommend a walking stick - not for walking, but to use as balance in the cave to help you not touch anything. You'll need it. The constant photo taking was a bit paparazzi like, but when you see all the photos at the end, it was worth it. You will want to buy the photo CD!

Expensive but worth it. Photographer was actually really experienced.GREAT TRIP!"

            "review": "Unique experience!. I wholeheartedly recommend this trip to anyone within driving distance of Rio Secreto. I have taken the trip twice now, and I have been blown away both times! As earlier reviewers have noted, be sure not to wear any sunscreen when you go. They give you a chance to shower off before entering the cave system, but the water is pretty chilly. They will also provide you with a wet suit, helmet, water shoes, towels, and a locker to store your belongings. I have a pretty sizable beach bag, and it fit easily in the locker! The only thing you need to bring is a change of clothes for after the tour. Be sure to wear your swimsuit when you arrive! For those who are a bit germaphobic, I would recommend bringing your own water shoes. They have some for sale at the location ($10 USD/pair). The tour starts with a bit of Mayan history and culture as a man gives the group a Mayan blessing, and then you are off. Once in the cave system, you will be in awe the entire time. We did the 1.5 hour tour, and it felt like just enough time to get the gist of what all is down there. The water is pleasant year round. It's not warm by any means, but it's very refreshing and you adjust quickly with the wet suit! Lunch is also included in this price. Nunes was our guide for this trip, and he was so kind, knowledgeable, and fun! He did a great job explaining how to navigate the occasionally tricky terrain. For the most part, the caves you'll be exploring are pretty roomy. Parts can get tight at times: at one point, we had to put our faces in the water in order to get under some low-hanging stalactites, but that was the worst that it got. You can buy photos for $25 USD per single photo or pay more for the disc. My husband and I could not bring ourselves to pay that price, but the memories we made will stay in our minds forever! Really and truly, this is the most unique experience I have ever had in Mexico. Be sure to book this trip!"

I am so grateful when a \"natural attraction\" for tourists is built on a foundation of care, planning, and appreciation for the place itself, which is not always the case in Quintana Roo. Rio Secreto is this. It's also a magnificent experience of the area's subterranean complexity and beauty. The cost includes your wetsuit ( plan to wear it over a swimsuit for time spent swimming underground), a helmet w/ attached headlight, a shower (wear NO nonorganic sunscreen or bug repellant; you're entering the region's aquifer, and its ecosystem), a wooden walking staff (take it! The underwater surface is uneven), and afterwards, a buffet lunch. We spent well over an hour in the cave system, in a small multinational group, with our guide, Jorge, who was deeply knowledgable as well careful and funny. We bought the CD of photos; well worth every peso going to the support of this fine example of true ecotourism. There are no lights, no cement walkways, no intrusions on the experience. A claustrophobe might have a few tough moments; although there are no narrow passageways or crawl-throughs, you are definitely underground, and in a different world. Personally, I felt as if I could have stayed down there much longer, it was all so strange and beautiful. Highly recommended!"

We loved this trip which I believe was 4.5 hours from being picked up at our hotel (the Barcel\u00f3 Maya Beach) to being dropped back off.: you wear your bathing suit and rinse off from the neck down in an outdoor shower prior to getting in a wet suit and life jacket and water shoes: lockers are provided to stow your stuff and a wrist band they give you is the key to opening it: no sunscreen needed on this trip: it's a little physical so if you can't walk or climb uneven surfaces this isn't for you but you don't have to be athletic or anything. You walk through some scrubby jungle on the way to and from the caves but it's not very far....5 minutes maybe.: the buffet lunch was more than adequate and tasty and you have to pay for the drinks (at the end of the counter) so don't....they bring you jugs of good liquid refreshments to your table which are included: a photographer and your guide are with you at all times. Some photos are taken without you knowing, others are posed.: our guide was Nunes (pronounced New-ness...not sure about spelling) and he was extremely impressive...so knowledgeable, helpful and patient. Our group was comprised of Spanish speaking people except for me and my husband for whom he had to repeat everything in English. I don't know how these guides do it. He is a treasure. (Having said that, one of my least favourite things was having to wait sooo long to hear the English part so I could understand.): we forgot our credit card and ended up wanting to buy the photos but no problem...through email and paypal we just bought them and downloaded them yesterday from back home in British Columbia. They weren't all good...but most of them were and we got 28 photos for what turned out to be about $78 Cdn. Not bad value and they send you a set of stock photos of plants and animals which inhabit the area. Of course you get to see every photo on an I-pad before committing.Go...you must see this :)"

            "review": "Great experience, natural beauty. We loved Rio Secreto! It was so wonderful to be in a cave that hasn't been overdeveloped to accommodate visitors. There were no lights, no paths, no handholds, it's as if you wandered straight into the jungle and were the first people setting foot into it. That being said, you should be fairly sure of foot to venture here, though they do offer walking sticks that's I'd recommend - I didn't take one but I had a husband to hold on to. :) A stick would have been a bit smarter, mostly for the areas where you're walking in shallow water and can't really see where you're stepping. There were some older folks on our tour and they did just fine.Our guide, Hector, was fabulous and friendly; in fact, everyone there was very cheerful and helpful. The caves were beautiful, swimming in them was a real treat, and the water was not actually that cold. We floated in a small cave area and turned out all our lights for a real sensory deprivation experience. They include a brief Mayan prayer before you go in, and a shot of the local alcohol when you get out (yum). They do give you wetsuits (you don't have a choice), which helps if you might be chilled by the water. Also a helmet and a floatation vest and reef shoes. There's an option to buy shoes for $10 if you don't want to wear the shared ones. Also be advised that you spend a fair bit of time standing around in just your swimsuit, so if you're someone that's shy about it (like me), just brace yourself for it. But it should definitely not deter you.A photographer follows you and you take several breaks to snap photos, of course they want you to buy them. And if you want photos, you have no choice since you can't bring your camera. We bought the CD of them all for $69, it was steep but they say the money goes to helping preserve the natural state (may or may not be true, but hey). I'd recommend this to anyone (as long as they can do the hiking requirements - it's not strenuous by any stretch, but you do need a sure step). There's no need to be highly adventurous, curiosity is all you need. The only folks who might not like it are those that are afraid of the dark or have claustrophobia, since some of the areas have very low ceilings."

My girlfriend and I visited Rio Secreto Saturday, February 22nd, 2014.We booked the 10 am tour and were fortunate enough to have only two others on our tour (couple of crazy girls from Sweden - nice people and we had a great tour).All of the positive reviews are true - and the pictures attest to the natural beauty of the place.When we arrived we were greated by Sac Nicte (means white flower in Mayan). She speaks English, Spanish, French and is currently studying Russian. Very impressive. She answered all our questions, and introduced us to our guide: Nunes. from Angola.Nunes was great and knowledgeable and put up with all of my good natured teasing.THE CENOTE: The pictures speak for themselves - absolutely stunning.PHOTOS: I'd like to comment on the few reviews regarding no cameras allowed (and thinking it was a scam to get you to buy the photos from them). This is not the reason at all. We were in a small group, and I've done a lot of spelunking. Individuals would not be able to keep up with the tour with everyone stopping to take photos. Additionally, you do have to pay attention to where you are walking, so there would likely be injuries / falls with people taking their own photos. Not to mention you likely would not get any quality photos down in the cenote without professional equipment.But, the main reason for no cameras that made sense to me - was people DROPPING CAMERAS into the cenote, and POLLUTING the water and ecosystem when the batteries erode.We bought the entire picture package of photos - and got a nice bottle of the Mayan liquor XTABENTUN. The word xtabent\u00fan means \"vines growing on stone\" in the Mayan language.This is a liqueur made from anise seed, and fermented honey produced by honey bees from the nectar of xtabent\u00fan flowers (a species of morning glory whose seeds contain ergine and have hallucinogenic properties------WEeeeeeeee =)FOOD: I thought the buffet after the tour was great ! Variety of options, and eat as much as you want. I especially enjoyed the chicken that I put over the white rice.Overall I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this tour if you enjoy nature and the unique experiences of countries you visit."

The amount of fish isn't that much and they are very small. There are parts where it is hard to walk and you really need to get down low and you can't hold on to any of the formations. The wet suites aren't too uncomfortable but I didn't really enjoy the water shoes that you get for free. The water in the caves are very cold and the caves themselves are pretty dark. They provide you with helmets but again, these aren't the most comfortable things and my helmet smelled like an armpit. Those things don't really matter though, the experience itself was amazing. Our guide Manuel was very good and gave us a lot of information about the cave. We were put with some people from France on our tour so it took a little longer because everything had to be said in English and then French too. Don't get too excited for the lunch after the tour as I found it not very tasty and lacking in options. There are hammocks all around once you are done with lunch but many of them have holes. The overall experience was amazing. From the swimming while underground to the interesting formations. There are some spots that could use improving but that's not the main part of Rio Secreto."

It does stink that you can't bring in your own camera, on the other hand, the tour needs to keep moving and that would be bad to have to wait for someone to take their pictures - it would not be safe either, if someone got separated from their group. But the costs of the pictures is just SO EXPENSIVE. The lunch buffet was not great - just really blah food. I wish there was a way to drive in on your own instead of having to wait to go back with your van. We booked a \"tour\" which I think this experience would be much better if we had our own car and didn't waste half the morning picking up other tourists from other hotels and dropping them off on the way back etc. That certainly is not Rio Secreto's fault, but just to warn you, your tour in the caves is approximately 50 minutes. It's the drive from the parking lot through the \"jungle\" and the lunch that is the vast majority of your tour. This tour would be really great for families with older children. I don't know what the min. age is, but I don't think anyone under 10 would be ok with going in the caves. I think a family with tweens would really enjoy this as a neat experience the entire family would enjoy and a memory for life. A group of friends or couples would also like this too. The caves are a really neat experience and I am so glad we chose this over swimming in another cenote!"

This is an amazing cave, newly discovered and \"raw\", in that there's no graffiti and no trash. The delicate stalactites and stalagmites are completely intact, some thin as a pencil, some thick and meeting to form sculptured columns. The trip to the cave involves about 10 minutes on a dirt road. The hike thru it can be done by anyone even slightly active. You will see an untouched cave, with natural pools and caverns normally only accessible on a longer spelunking trip in other caves. Here you can walk/swim through it. Gypsum and limestone sparkle in the light, and the water in the pools is warm and clear. There are a couple short swim/floats (you're in a wetsuit and life jacket, which they supply)-and during these, you can roll on your back and look up to spires of rock better than any cathedral. Caves like this do not last untouched for long and I salute this company for limiting the age and numbers who see it. As an aside, we thought the food was awesome. Tasty chicken and rice with three complex hot sauces to go on top, plus fresh salad w/ veggies from their garden. (Again, the people who complain about the food are most likely favoring the generic cruise food.) Go, go, go if you can-try to do it in a smaller group but see it any way you can. Really. Go. Be brave. The guides are wonderful, will help you get through the tight spots. Go and be grateful. This type of untouched raw gorgeous cave is an endangered wonder."

Lunch and a celebratory drink were a pleasant plus. Don't miss this if you enjoy the unusual and something \"out of the box.\" Only problem was getting charged for the CD when I purchased a T-shirt (difference of $52 dollars) which I hope to have remedied later today."

            "review": "Truly on of the best caves we've ever been in.. We went during an excursion on board the carnival magic. We ported in Cozumel and took the tender. The tender ride was the worst experience for my wife and everyone else on board. We hit bad weather and everyone was throwing up on board the tender. To make matters worse, the tender ride was about 45min long. It was not so bad on the way back as the weather had calmed down.  The cave itself was amazing and so worth the tender ride to get there. Truly fascinating. We had been deprecated into a group of 7 and then we had our guide, Jacque. He was from France. He was a great tour guide. We were so secluded from the other groups. They tell you that swimming is a must but you have a life jacket so it is not actually a requirement. My wife cannot swim and was worried but after we got to the part where you are in 30feet of water she just paddled her way thru and was fine. The tour operators are very careful about preserving the stalagmites and I appreciate that very much. The food afterwards was wonderful. The prices for the whole cd of pics runs about 69.00 but very well worth the price. Cannot forget to mention the Mayan liquor that you are given shots of afterwards. It's black licorice liquor, pretty much Sambuca. It was awesome!!! Recommend this tour highly to everyone!!!"

Literally went in expecting very little as we picked up the tour just for fun without seeing any brochures or reviews.wish we could have brought our own camera to take more pictures. The photographer there is good but there is maybe at most 20 shots of you posing at certain parts. Wanted more pictures of the adventure.

I had some difficultly (due to a bum leg) but he made sure I was always on firm footing and he is very informative. The caves were spectacular and surprisingly warm. To think this cave was discovered by accident in 2006 is amazing. It is impossible to describe the feeling you get floating in an underground river. (peaceful). After the tour they fed us a delicious meal and gave us a shot of a special tequila. Mexicans know how to give great value for the price. If anyone is debating doing this tour thet should take it. My friend who is claustrophobic had no problems whatsoever. All you'll need for this tour is a sense of adventure and the ability to walk through uneven terrain. Hope you go!"

            "review": "What a great experience!. I visited Rio Secreto caves while in a cruise with my wife. We bought the excursion through the cruise and we were hoping we made the right decision. It was definitely worth it. We were taken in the Catamaran from the port in Cozumel to Playa del Carmen and were greeted there by guides from the get go. Playa del Carmen was beautiful. We were given a few instructions and we were on our way via air conditioned, very comfortable vans. The ride from the beach to the entrance of the cave complex is about 20 min with no to light traffic. Once you get there is about another 10 min through a non paved road with plenty of turns and ups and downs, but the vans are pretty comfortable and the drivers are experienced. When we got here we were greeted by our cave guide Hector, he took us to change and provided all the necessary gear, from water shoes to wet suits and helmets. We were also provided lockers to place our belongings at no additional charge. Our group was ten people. Then our adventure began with a quick walk through the jungle while Hector told us the story of how this cave system was discovered. Before entering the caves we stopped for an authentic Mayan ceremony to grant us permission to descent in to Mother Earth, I thought this was really cool- be respectful during the ceremony- after which we began down into the cave system. It was absolutely breath taking. Our guide Hector was great, he knew every inch of the place, and was knowledgeable about the stalagmites and stalactites and different formations he was eager to show us. He had the group stop at one place while we floated in the water and had us turn off our lights and just feel nature around us for a couple of minutes, it was incredible. To be honest i don't really remember how long we were down there, but as we emerge for the quick walk back to the complex, we couldn't stop talking about the experience. Hector then took us to change and we met for a shot of this sweet liquor - on the house-, we raised our shots and toasted for the awesome day and the chance to have shared the experience. They do not allow you to take a camera into the cave, however there is a second person from the guide team who follows taking great pictures of the group, couples and singles, which is cool as you would probably miss a lot of details if you had to worry about taking your own pictures. Now, this guys were top of the line, by the time we were done with the shots, of which I had two myself, our pictures were ready for viewing on individual iPads for each couple or single person. You get to choose either a single picture for US $25, or the whole thing for US$69. I thought that was a bit pricey, but nevertheless purchased one of the pictures that I really liked. They were all good, to be honest it was difficult to chose, and I was tempted to buy the whole thing, but as I said - it was pricey considering the actual amount of pictures I would've gotten of my wife and I. Anyway, we made our choice and were taken to eat lunch while our picture was being burned onto a CD. Hector then showed us to the buffet and tables, he gave us a quick description of the different foods available and we sat down still as a team to eat and talk, the food was fresh and really good. Meanwhile Hector was actually nice enough to go get some peroxide, cotton and bandaids for some of us who had a small scratch her or there from rubbing against a rock or two. He actually sat down and cleaned the scratches and applied the bandaids. After a plentiful lunch, our picture CDs were delivered and we got to relax for a bit in the chairs, swinging amacas and beds they have in the gardens, before getting back into our van for the drive back to the beach. Our guide Hector was awesome, he stayed with the group until we were all sitting in the van and waved us off. Although you are not obligated to tip your guide I think these guys deserve a little something specially if you're treated the way Hector did my group. The trip back to the beach was a bit longer than the trip from, due to additional traffic during rush hour, but we used the added time to talk more about the experience and check out the city sights. Back at the beach, we still had about 45 min of free time to walk around or hit the beautiful beach just paces from were our van dropped us off, we were told at what time to be back for the ride back to Cozumel via Catamaran, and then released to do as we pleased. My wife and I hit the stores and then came back for a quick dip in the crystal clear water of Playa del Carmen, before we were back in our sits for the ride back to the port. All in all, what a great experience, the right choice of excursion, a great day!"

Most of time your in the water usually no more than knee deep. Water is so clear! There is a good reason why they don't allow cameras inside...there is a good chance it will be broken by the time you leave. Very uneven surface...We fell several times...they do have a photographer with your group the entire trip and while the photos are pricey they are very well done. Lunch was provided...it was ok...buffet with one hot entree... Restroom and showers facility nice....Guide Paulo from Costa Rica was very nice and knew his stuff...The lights out was a very unique experience...total darkness inside the cave...hard to explain...something you have to experience yourself."

Absolutely loved it, shame we have no photos to remind us of the experience as so many were taken by the photographer but couldn't justify paying $25 US for one, sadly they have set this price too high and would sell many more if they lowered it to say $15.

The ferry ride was terrible... just an FYI for anyone who might have to take the ferry to get to Rio Secreto like we did. We were prepared however and took Dramamine, mints, and sat on the bottom level as close to the center of the boat as possible. This helped to prevent the seasickness. There were other people vomiting on the ferry ride. HOWEVER despite this terrible ferry ride, we would still do it again, because the cave system at Rio Secreto is so incredible! It was worth any seasickness we acquired. Pros:The folks at Rio Secreto provide everything; wetsuits, headlamps, watershoes, walking stick, even a personal photographer who follows you around and takes photos as you go. The guide was knowledgable, funny, and clearly loved the cave system. The cave system is as beautiful as the pictures show. Following the tour in the cave, we were given a lunch that was fairly good. Then we were allowed to lounge in the plentiful amount of hammocks that are around the area. All-in-all it was an amazing day!Cons: We did not like the photographer situation. It's an awesome idea to have a professional photographer take all the pictures for you, it frees up your hands and your attention so you can focus solely on the amazing sights in front of you. However we found that the \"candid\" shots they take turn out.... funny... most people in the photos have eyelids half shut, odd facial expressions etc. I think it would have been better if they did more pose-type photos and less candid photos."

Got picked up from the dock in Playa del Carman after the ferry ride from our Carnival Cruise Ship Liberty and immediately put into groups of ten and transported to The Rio Secreto. The ride there is bumpy as the gravel road needs work but once at the site, you are given wet suits, flotation vests, hard hats with lights and amble instructions about the caves and hike. You need to be in relatively good shape for this excursion but not an athlete by any means. Just coordinated !!! Without spoiling the surprise, there is an amazing walk through the underground caves and some water to be swam in but trust me when I say this was an amazing excursion that I would repeat in a second. My two children (girl 10, boy 13) said it was \"awesome\" and \"epic\". The best part was that beside the people you're with, you don't really see a lot of other tourists around as all the tours are well spaced. Even during the included lunch, it was very comfortable. And photos taken by your group photographer can be purchased online after you get home so no big sales push at the time."

Please note this is not an excursion for people who have balance problems or back trouble. I have a back injury and I found myself quite sore by the end of the excursion. The floor is consistently uneven and rocky inside the cave therefore it's difficult to keep your balance and even harder if you already have balance troubles. The scenery is beautiful and a once in a lifetime experience. A photographer comes along and takes a lot of pictures throughout the tour which was nice. At the end of the tour we went to look at our pictures and learned that if we wanted our pictures it would cost us 100$ US which was really ridiculous to us. We could get 1 picture for 20$ US which again we felt was pricey. We already paid enough for the tour and we felt almost like we were being ripped off at this point...

He was extremely knowledge and treated the history, rituals and environment with extreme care. The drive thru the Jungle was AWFUL. I understand keeping the environment how it is but the pot holes can be fixed easily with sand. If you get car sick, take something for it because our van had to stop on the way there and on way back for a passenger to get sick. I know this person and no, they were not hungover. Even us who are not prone to motion sickness felt ill. When doing this excursion, take time to relax and enjoy the beauty around you, the healing waters of the cenotes and take money to purchase your pictures because cameras are not allowed but pictures are worth it. Would recommend to all"

            "review": "Terrific cenotes - pretty great tour. Rio Secreto is a well oiled machine when it comes to getting everyone through the caves - but not perfect. I stayed at the GBP Sian Ka'an and the driver was an HOUR late picking me up. I admit, this didn't give a great impression for me considering they asked me to be ready at 6:45 AM on my holiday! And when I arrived, with a couple also staying at GBP, we waited another 30 minutes for the rest of the group they put us with to arrive. Happily, they had a little cafe :) Our guide was very knowledgeable, but since the other six people in our group spoke another language, that's the language he spoke most of the time (even though his english was great!). There were lots of other english speaking groups, so I was disappointed to be in a bilingual group, because I think I missed out on a lot of great conversation and information. And for some reason we were \"behind\" coming out of the caves, so were totally rushed through lunch. And lunch was GREAT! And in a lovely little open air building. They didn't rush us through the sales pitches though - for a liquor they make there, as well as the really expensive photos. As for the actual caves, they were pretty cool. They really respect the environment (warning - cold oudoor shower before you walk through the jungle!). You really have to pay attention to where you're walking in the caves though - pretty much 90% of the time. And some spots are very skinny!Enjoyable way to spend 1/2 day - especially if it's raining or something.Note that they have lockers for you to store you things in while you go to the cenote, so you can put the same clothes back on if you want.Warning - drive into cenote is SUPER bumpy. Like you-may-need-a-chiropractor-afterward bumpy! But not paving the road is part of their respect for keeping the terrain and cenotes in their natural state, so it's a good thing :)"

They have an nice area to change clothes and lockers (with locks) to put your dry clothes etc... The guides and staff are very nice and helpful. The ride in from the main road is 7km (if you get motion sickness this is not a ride you will want to go on). It did look like they are working on improving the road. The pictures on the website are very acurate and the cave is beautiful. The walking in the cave is on uneven surfaces and is a little slippery at times. The food after the tour is good. Play close attention to your guides instructions about the hot sauces. The only problem that we had was getting back to the resort, we are not sure if they did not have a person show up or had trouble with one of the vans, but after we were done eating it took them about an hour to find us a ride back to our resort. We asked several times how much longer and always got the answer of just a few more minutes. When we did get a driver she could not speak english, and did not know how to get to the resort for sure. But she was trying real hard to get us back. That is the only reason I did not give them a five for a overall rating."

They allow only special underwater camera, so if you don't have such, then you may buy CD, which was quite expensive (69 USD) and unfortunately mixed with other people photos. Anyway, professional photos in CD was a good memory of amazing views in the cave. Walking through jungles was amazing experience. Would repeat this again :)"

The cave is kept in pristine condition by having small group guided tours. The cave and jungle are kept natural and are not over developed and touristy. A excellent Mexican lunch is included.You will walk, wade and swim through this cave. A wet suite, helmet with light, water shoes, and flotation vest are all provided. So you do not need to know how to swim! The cave and water are a constant 77 degrees. Make no mistake this is a real cave exploration! The tour uses a path that is relatively easy to negotiate but if you have mobility issues this tour is not for you.Our guide Benito was fantastic. You can tell he really loves this cave and wants to share its beauty with you while protecting it from damage. He explains the formations, shows you the cave life, i.e. blind fish, cat fish, and shrimp. He explains how it was discovered, the Mayan history of the cave, and its part in the system of caves in the peninsula.A must do excursion."

Our guide was Nunes for the cave exploration - a .37 mile (according to tour description) of walking, wading and swimming in underground caverns but it seemed much farther. However, started with bone jarring 6 mile van ride in the nature preserve due to mammoth pot holes. Outfitted with wet suit and water shoes, helmet and headlamps, the headlamps providing the only light in cavern. Water in caves relatively warm. Was given a walking stick - the cavern walking was over very uneven, bumpy, narrow trails but you can't touch the stalagmites or stalactites for support. Sometimes we walked in human chain hand-to-hand, which made it difficult with walking sticks. My husband and I made it but probably not strong enough swimmers - just floating on back, dog addle, breast stroke - but we should have been in better shape. I'm glad we did it, but don't know if we'd do it again due to swimming part. Description says children must be 6 - I can't imagine taking children on this at all"

We were driven to Rio Secreto, given a snack, and then down into the river we went! Our tour guide was Rene, I think? He was wonderful, patient with a member in our group who needed help, very knowledgeable...we could tell he loved his job and felt a deep connection to the river.

There are three trails - we did the one called happiness. For this reason Rio Secret has the capacity to accommodate more tourists in smaller groups.The guides give brief explanations. I would have preferred more information on the formation, the minerals and the life there. Sometimes I had the feeling that the guide did not understand our questions. However, he was extremely nice and friendly and tried his best so overall I am happy.The pictures are very expensive - 25 USD for one picture and 69 USD for a CD with not too many pictures. It is impossible to share the cost of the pictures within the group because you are offered to look at only the pictures of yourself and not the other participants (except for the group pictures). How they do it so quickly, I have no idea. The pictures do not open on any computer but the older computers have no problem opening them.The food is ridiculous. If somebody pays 79 USD for the experience, that person knows what good food means. To serve a potato puree from powder and a soup where you try to fish some chicken is simply insulting. We are not idiots. It is better not to serve any food in my view than to serve something below any standards. I agree with some of the comments that the Chichen-Itza tourist buffet was less expensive and much more decent. So eat before you go there, if you are a person for whom food matters.Enjoy the cave!"

The drive here through the jungle is long and bumpy but once you arrive it was all great. The staff is awesome, everyone is very friendly and knowledgeable. Our guide Hector was probably the best tour guide I've ever had. The jungle/forest is beautiful and the caves just blew us away. Luckily we were part of the English speaking group and there were only 4 of us, Hector gave us an amazing experience and said we were lucky to be part of a small & intimate group (the spanish and french speaking groups were 8+). They took some excellent pictures of us as well. The best part (spoiler alert?) is when we got to the middle of the cave, he asked us to sit/squat down and be quiet, and turned off the lights. We sat there in the pitch black for a couple of minutes and once our eyes adjusted, it was probably the best experience of my life. Absolute serenity surrounded by sounds of water dripping, it was perfect. Also, the entire staff is great, the bathrooms/locker rooms are very clean, the mayan lunch served was just a bit boring for us but nothing to complain about really.We booked this excursion through Playacar Palace and were able to get a deal to use our resort credits earned to follow Rio Secreto up with ATV riding just a few minutes away. It was a perfect combo, the ATV property is owned by the same guy, and we even ran into him during the ATV adventure."

Booking went smoothly and they answered all questions per-arrival.We were picked up at our hotel at 11:00am (on time) and we drove about 40 minutes to Rio Secreto. Once we arrived we were given a bracelet and we headed to a little hut for a quick orientation. After the orientation we were grouped by language and boarded a van to drive 7 km to the site. This was a downside of the tour. It was 7km of extremely rough road so you drive 10km \u2013 20km (if that) so the drive was long. You get bounced around a lot (I had a sore neck the next day), and if you get queasy, this might be an issue for you.After the drive you arrive to the site where you are teamed up with your tour guide and a photographer (you can\u2019t take your own pictures). The guide does a quick briefing and you then need to take a full rinse off in the cold shower (no makeup, lotions, etc). You are then fitted with shoes, a helmet (make sure your light works before putting it on), a wet suit and life jacket. If you tend to get cold easily you make want to bring/wear a long sleeve rashy. You also have the option of taking a walking stick. At first I did not want to take it as I thought it would get in the way. Take my advice\u2026 take the stick. I was so glad I did, as was the others I spoke to.You then go for a short hike through the woods and do a little ceremony and then head into the caves.The caves are absolutely stunning. I won\u2019t go into much detail here as you have to see it for yourself. The guide takes through the caves, mostly walking with a little \u2018floating\u2019 explaining the different formations as you go. The ground is uneven so the walking stick came in handy. Once you finish you head back to the main area for a buffet lunch which was very good. You then have the option here to purchase the pictures that where taken. This was a huge disappointment. I have no problem paying for pictures. After doing the tour I can see why they don\u2019t want people taking their own pictures (dangerous to balance down there, and it slows things down). However the photographer\u2019s equipment failed half way through the tour so we never had a chance to get shots with your own group. Also, the picture he did take where out of focus. We had no choice but to purchase them as it was the only hard copy memory we had. They did offer us a discount but I\u2019m just disappointed in the quality and lack thereof.Once all was done we hoped back on the van for the 7km rough drive to the entrance, and then straight back to the hotel.Overall I do recommend this tour as it is a spectacular site to see. The food was really good and our guide was absolutely amazing and you can see she really enjoyed her job"

We chose this excursion because it looked interesting and the person helping us on Carnival Magic said he had heard great things about it. We took a 45 minute boat ride from Cozumel to Playa Del Carmen. Once there we had about a 15 minute wait then we were picked up and taken to the location. I think it was about 20 minutes. Turned out the guide from Carnival Magic was taking the same excursion and ended up being in our group. If you are able to choose your guide ask for Alfredo. He was great. The caves themselves were amazing. The water perfectly clear. Alfredo was informative and funny. Water was a little cold at first but you get used to it pretty quick. By the way, you really don't need the wet suite. They are kind of smelly and you just don't need it. Just wear your swim suit, life vest and hard hat and you will be much more comfortable. The food at the end of the tour was good. The pictures are a little expensive but they are professional looking. My favorite parts of the tour are when the water is deep enough to float in. Very nice and my wife would add that your skin feels pretty good afterward as well. I guess from the high calcium content in the water. If you are wanting an excursion that is fun, informative and just plain cool this would be my recommendation."

Loved the caves, peaceful and serene, nature at its best !Just book it and go !"

We found it to be enjoyable but there is a lot of odd positions one has to assume to pass without injuring yourself. I talked with the guide who said each time in is a little different depending on water height and which cave they go through. We (3) and group of another 5 had a great time. My daughter and I wore our keens water shoes and had to deal with little pebbles so I would suggest closed water shoes, which will allow you to not be distracted while in the caves. I did scrape my leg but it wasn't bad and has healed nicely. The food was good but the hot sauce both red and green are HOT so beware! We got the big package, pictures (CD), a shirt, hat, and bottle of their wine for 125$. Which we felt was a good deal. The CD alone was 69$. Our guide was extremely informative and respectful of the caves which was great. Don't know about taking little ones in the cave, although I am sure they could contort better than I did."

Our family group included kids from a seven and nine years old to grandparents in and approaching 70.....because of our excellent guide, Raul (with 3 \"r's\"), all of us were able to negotiate this underground wonderland safely and without fear. We were outfitted with short wet suits, life jackets and a helmet with a light. Most of the adults used the walking sticks and were glad we did. The floors of the cave are uneven and a little climbing up and down is required. The caves are completely dark...and the headlights are the only source of light. When we turned our lights off at one point, you could not see your hand inches from your face. The caves are magical and beautiful. My husband is very claustrophobic and wasn't sure he'd be able to do it. However, Raul took us on a route with open caves and he was there to encourage him as needed. He was glad he did it. The adventure is followed by a good lunch. You aren't allowed to take cameras into the caves, but a photographer accompanies each group and a CD can be purchases. Well worth it."

We were outfitted with water shoes, wet suit, life vest, and a helmet with a light. After a short walk in the jungle and a Mayan blessing ceremony, we walked down into an opening in the ground and entered the river. Most of the time the water was only a foot or two deep, but a couple times we had to swim a bit as it was too deep to walk. The caves opened up and we saw fantastic stalactites and stalagmites. We didn't touch them, of course, but you had extremely closeup views to see the texture and colors. There were so many shapes and formations. I loved every minute of the couple hours in the caves! Our guide was very helpful and knowledgeable. He suggested we take a walking stick to help keep our balance, and that was good advice. There are a number of places in the river that have rocks and uneven surfaces, but I didn't find it very difficult. The photos on the website are real, but only look brightly lit because of flash photography. Our headlamps were terrific to see where you were walking in the water, and also to see the formations all around the caves. When we all turned our headlamps off, it was totally dark! All you could hear is the dripping and flowing water! Fantastic! After the tour, we tasted a Mayan liqueur made with honey and anise (thick and syrupy), looked at the photos the photographer took, and had a nice included buffet lunch. My only complaint would be we didn't have much time to eat before we had to get back to the main road to transfer to the coach for the return trip to the hotel. Our guide said that was because we stayed in the cave a bit longer than some groups. I just loved this tour and highly recommend it!"

This is more of a small family owned operation....not a \"mass\" tour. They limit tours to 9-12 people per tour group...sure makes it more fun ! I know there was a couple other groups in the caverns at the same time we were, but we never saw or heard them.Our guide was wonderful and a wealth of information (and patience:) . By the way...our \"group\" consisted of only 7 people plus the guide and a photographer that popped up once in a while. While this is a small river flowing through caverns, most of the time you are wading or walking, not swimming. The water is crystal clear and actually safe enough to drink ! While this adventure takes place in a cavern high cellings, there are some places you have to duck low in very short passages to get to next cavern system. A correlation would be that if you can stand riding in an elevator for a min. or two you will not have a problem with claustrophobia(it was one of my worries) on this adventure.We took this adventure while on a cruise to Cozumel and the tour picked us up in a van and afterwards returned us to the ship. I believe only 7 people from our ship of 2,400 people took this adventure....how sad that they missed out on so much fun .Our time estimate includes the ferry ride from Cozumel to Casa de Playa to meet the tour van and return to the ship. Actual time on the tour itself is less than 2 hours...that includes the time for free drinks and lunch AFTER the adventure :)We got back to the ferry dock early and so even had time to do a little shopping before the ferry departed ! I am not sure what the time line would be if you were taking this tour from another area such as Cancun ? .Wife and I totally enjoyed our adventure and would love to do it again with friends."

From start to finish, the tour was awe inspiring. Although the terrain at times inside the caverns was uneven, it was certainly suitable for people of all ages and physical abilities. The camaraderie felt at the end of the day was unique and heartwarming. Our guide, Alfredo, was so pleased to explain what we were seeing, and very careful to let us know, when we would need to be aware of our footing, and help those following behind us. The safety equipment supplied by the tour operator was great. Certainly above average quality and condition. The lunch included was delicious and offered a variety of flavours and textures typical of the region. Lots of time to meander about after the tour, or lounge in the hammocks before heading back on the bus. DON'T MISS THIS ONE FOLKS.....IT IS WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY.

The road to the cave is very bumpy but there are reason for that which is explained on the tour. They gave us wet suits, helmet with a light, water shoes and life jacket (vest). They broke the group into smaller groups based on the language they spoke. We got a briefing before we started so we knew what to expect and I was impressed with how well organized they were. Sandra took my smaller English speaking group into the caves. It's a little slow going at first as the terrain is uneven but everyone helps everyone get through and nobody was left to fed for themselves. The inside of the caves are dark and cool and the water wonderful. If it's a hot day you will LOVE this tour. We learned the history and had lots of photos taken by a professional that we could buy on a disk for $69. The pictures were so great I couldn't resist. art of the caves are in deep water and you float along - a relief after trying to find your footing on the rocks. I recommend this to all the able bodied adventurous people. My friend had a bad back and made out fine. They gave us towels after and we changed and had a buffet lunch included in your package (wine & beer is $3 extra) The buffet was excellent. I would do this again."

The only slight down side was that we were the first hotel on the pick up point so we rode around for an hour while they picked up others for this tour and for those going to XCARET. We transferred to a smaller bus later who then took us to Rio Secreto. From there, you transfer again and travel 7km on an unpaved road to the caves. Everything was included. They provided towels, life jackets, helmets, head lamp, a wetsuit if you want (which I recommend) and water shoes (though we previously had red we needed to bring our own they gave them free of charge). Alfredo was out guide and extremely passionate and very friendly. Its a very unique experience and you could tell how much he loved going down into these caves which he said was his absolute favorite. Once in the caves you are almost always in water, anything from ankle deep to floating. If you can't swim, its not a problem. When it became really deep we simply floated and used our arms to push ourselves.. there was no actual swimming involved... and the times when you are fully submerged is less then when you wade through the shallows. There are parts which are uneven and slippery so be careful. The water was cool, it was not freezing but I am glad we chose to use the wetsuits though you can go without (lifejackets are mandatory either way). You are not allowed to bring your own camera but they do have a photographer along with you. The photo were great but of course, they cost an arm and a leg. It was $25 USD for one photo or you could get the entire CD of your photos for $69 USD. For $120 USD (I think) they would throw in some bottles of alcohol, all the pictures, a T-shirt and a hat. You don't really have much choise if you want some type of momento given you can't bring a go pro or anything else into the cave. All jewelry has to come off as well, rings, necklaces, earings, etc. When we were done we had a buffet lunch with chips, salsa, chicken, mash potatoes, rice, and a few other options. The food was nothing spectacular but we were not expecting it to be either. Tea and water were free but beer, soft drinks and snacks (candy bars and chips) were extra which you could pay for. We then relaxed in the hammocks for a bit before heading back to hour hotels, this time we had a straight ride and did not have to switch busses."

The other was swimming in the cenote at Rio Secreto. As other travelers have said, it's only been open to the public for 5 years and only 150 people pass through each day. It is absolutely worth the money. You and the kids will love it. When you get inside the cave, turn off all your helmet lights. It is pitch black in there. We bought the $55 CD with all the pics at the end. The lunch was \"ok\" but the actual experience is very beautiful and has created a wonderful memory for our family. It's a little pricey but swimming in this cenote is probably way better than what you'll get on a cheaper tour that probably includes a half day ATV session and all that. Don't do it. Stick with this one and you won't be sorry."

The site is about a 30 minute drive into Playa from the Cozumel ferry landing, 10 minutes of which is on the city's paved roads and 20 minutes of which is most certainly an off road experience on unpaved dirt roads. The facilities at Rio Secreto were clean and well kept. Upon arrival our group of 8 was introduced to Gouda, our guide, who was multilingual, friendly, upbeat and knowledgeable. We were supplied lockers and asked to shower in order to remove as much of the natural oils and chemicals on our skin as possible so that we would not damage the caves. We were outfitted with wet suits, water shoes, helmets with lights and life jackets. Departing their \"base\" we walked to a site where we participated in a ceremony spoken in the Mayan language asking for permission for our entrance to the caves. From there you walk down into one of many series of underground caves and climb, wade, swim and crouch your way through. You are asked not to use your hands or touch the walls of the caves and you have your guide and your helmet light to guide you. After nearly two hours underground, your senses are certainly sharpened. Where the water is deep enough to swim is the easiest portion of the tour physically. The shallower water areas and rocky terrain are more difficult to navigate, but not impossible. I believe that most people would be perfectly comfortable with the tour, but I would not recommend it for the elderly or disabled or those who have extremely poor balance. Also, as you are underground in a dark, enclosed and often tight space, I would not recommend it for those who are bothered by those things. Our guide, Gouda, was a really remarkable woman. She was attentive, caring, knowledgeable, thorough and offered many insights into the history of the land and the formation of the caves. The caves themselves are truly incredible to see. In addition to your guide, a photographer accompanies you on the tour. At first I felt that this was just so that they could sell you the photos (which they do), but it truly would be impossible for someone going on the tour to photograph the caves in the way they do and with their equipment. Also, you often need both hands free for balance. When we exited the caves, we were given towels to dry off and taken back to our lockers so that we might change into dry clothes. Then you enjoy shots of a local beverage and lunch. Then you have the opportunity to look at the photos that were taken of you in the caves and purchase them. If you opt to purchase, you can choose to buy just one photo for $25 or you can get all the photos on a disc which also includes some beautiful photos of the caves themselves for $70. For $110 you could get the photo disc with 2 bottles of their liquor. From there a van takes you back to the city to catch your ferry back to Cozumel. All in all, I would highly recommend this attraction for it's unique and awe-inspiring value."

Part way thru the hour and a half excursion our guide had us stop and stand still. he then instructed us to turn off our lights and WOW was it DARK.

Given that we boarded the van at 1140 hours and were back for supper, per hour, this was certainly the most expensive of the three excursions. The \"secret river\" is a long series of connected cenotes (underground sinkholes), source of all drinking water in the area, and filled with many fantastic calcium structures. It is worth seeing as a natural phenomenon. We didn't see any bats or fish, but these are said to be there as well. Our guide for this trip, Miroslava, was originally from Serbia. She said relatively little, but looked after us all, competently and kindly, throughout the afternoon. After an uneventful, easy walk through the jungle (several did it in sandals), we met a Mayan shaman who conducted a brief ceremony with a smoking lamp he circled in the air while he chanted a prayer for us before we could enter the first cenote. We then changed into our swimsuits (lockers are provided) and were outfitted with wetsuits, life jackets, headlighted helmets, et cetera. I soon wished I had purchased my own water shoes as the ones loaned me were full of holes and rather roomy. Fortunately, I did accept a walking stick (these should be mandatory for everyone as the \"steps\" in the cenotes are very slippery) so I could remove the stones which floated into my shoes. A protected natural reserve, the Rio Secreto is billed as a \"life-changing experience\", I don't know why. The water is clear and lovely, the stalagmites/stalactites/coral structures are impressive, and walking/floating single-file underground is not something most people will ever do, but \"life-changing\"?? At one point, Miroslava had us sit in the water, form a circle, and turn off our headlights to meditate for a few minutes in the dark. Perhaps it was this that was meant to prompt new insights. I was reminded of yoga, and wanted to end the session with \"Ommm\".We only spent about an hour in the secret river. A fair chunk of our time there was devoted to posing for expensive photos taken by young Mayans. It was my understanding that we might have toured more of the river but weren't given options. In any case, it was soon over, and it was time to change from our wet swimsuits before lunch. Miroslava provided us with an interesting drink we had not had before. Lunch was a modest buffet of traditional Mayan dishes, much like the lunch on the Ek Balam tour, and unlike the elaborate hotel buffet at Chichen Itza. We didn't have a credit card with us or sufficient cash to buy the photo package, but were told we could do this from home. When I emailed the company, all I received in return was a notice from Paypal to pay $69US. There apparently was no way of previewing the photos, or even of ensuring that I would receive the right ones.There is a companionship that arises among a group of strangers experiencing something new together. We enjoyed chatting with a woman from Sherbrooke and a family from Winnipeg. I think almost anyone would enjoy visiting Rio Secreto, once, excepting those particularly nervous about slippery rocks, darkness underground, or being in water over one's head (even with a lifejacket on). We don't plan to repeat the experience but are glad we did it once."

You get to hike, wade and swim through extensive caverns. At all times we felt safe with our knowledgeable guide \"Joan\", a fellow from Spain, very pleasant. I would suggest this trip to anyone. We booked through the hotel for $89 each and they picked us up and dropped us off. Lunch was included in the price. They do not let you touch the side of the cave, for obvious ecological reasons so there are some areas where more stability is needed. They do offer walking sticks which I did not take and I now think that would have been a good idea. The only bad thing or downside is the absolute ripoff with pictures! They charge $25.00 each or $69 for a few! It really is a gouge and they could sell many more by dropping their price. We were the only people in our group to pay for a picture!"

One photo costs $25 USD, while a whole CD of photos cost $60 USD. I found one shot that I liked but didn't feel that the added expense was worth it for me."

Each of us was given a mini-wetsuit, including boots, helmet with light and a PFD. Walking sticks available. Benito our guide was very well informed, English was excellent. He led us on an almost 2 hour tour of the most fantastic cave passages with water of varying depths from inches to over 7 feet. Crystal-clear, glass smooth with a sand-like bottom. The cavern was festooned with stalactites, 'soda-straws' and stalagmites, some of which had joined with their opposing stalactites to form columns. The limestone of the walls and ceilings pocked with holes, gaps, fissures. Benito kept a constant flow of information going in an easy, manner with humor. Thoroughly enjoyed the tour."

I have been in caves before in Texas and New Mexico, and those are beautiful - but imagine being in there and swimming through it!!We went through Best Day travel for this excursion and paid $89 USD Per Person. We were picked up at our hotel, picked up another couple and were on our way. Once at Rio Secreto we watched a video presentation and got divided up into groups and assigned a tour guide. (This is where we got lucky!) We then took a very bumpy van ride to the entrance of the cave.Where we got lucky - we were assigned Adriana, and she was absolutely passionate about Rio Secreto and about conservation and the spiritual aspect of the cenotes, and especially this one. I loved her knowledge of the culture and history and value to the people that the cenotes meant. She tried to help everyone on her excursion develop that sense of reverence for the place that she has.There was one guy in our group who could not do this due to his claustrophobia. I am slightly claustrophobic and getting into the wetsuit and tight life vest was trying for me (I don't like feeling restrained) but I breathed through that. If you ARE TRULY claustrophobic then this is NOT a trip for you. He walked into the first cave and broke out into a sweat and asked to be taken back.My husband has suffered 2 broken ankles and has plates in one, and he had a tough time navigating some of the rocks, but he did OK. If you have weak knees or bad ankles and can't crouch down and step or navigate your body like that you may have a hard time on this excursion.After the trip we were served a delicious lunch, and were offered photos of the trip (You can't bring your own camera).This was absolutely beautiful and wonder to experience. I am so blessed to experience it and would recommend it in a heartbeat."

The only reason I didn't give it an excellent rating is because the photo prices are WAY too expensive for digital photos and the quality isn't that great. One photo is $25. If they lower their prices and take better photos, they would probably sell a lot more of them!"

            "review": "An unexpected trip of appreciation. We visited Rio Secreto as part of a 2 place package for $109 per person. The other place we visited was a ATV 4-wheeling tour across the street. For the price we were picked up, dropped at the ATV place, picked up a few hours later, driven to Rio Secreto, fed at Rio Secreto and driven back to our resort - whole thing lasted about 9 hours.Rio Secreto was unbelievable - I had no idea it was going to be so 'earthy'. You literly are walking down into a real cave with rocks, stalactites, stalagmites, ect everywhere. It was an experience I will never forget. Our tour guide (Anatasia I think?) was amazing. She was so passionate about the natural wonder this cave was, as well as all caves (she mentioned on her recent vacation, she went cave exploring). It was great to see Rio Secreto employing people who were so passionate for this beauty of this natural site. They also fed you at the end of the trip - food was good. There were a number of places to chill out around the main waiting area while waiting for your van to pick up you (hammocks!!). What I will also say is unless you are somewhat physically fit, no knee issues and are open to nature - you will love this place. However if you scared of trying new things, this might not be the place for you. The cave was beatiful, and I do not think I'll ever be able to have an experience like this again. But if you are scared of small spaces, walking in unknown waters, scared of the dark, bats - I'd do some more research before going here. I felt like if this such of a place was in the US, they would never allow such a place without additional safety precautions put into place (mostly due to potential lawsuits). I'm not saying that is a bad thing at all - just stating my thoughts on the rugged-ry of the place. The only negative I have is that the picture prices are ridiculous. Since this was such an awesome experience, I fealt okay with buying a picture - but they wanted $25 for ONE picture. I thought okay maybe it would come printed, in a cardboard frame - but nope.....ONE picture on a burned CD in an envelope. That is it. It would have been nice for $25 if they actually gave me a hard printed picture as well."

Arrived at the base site after only a short ride from the hotel. We transferred vans and took a bumpy ride into the site itself. We were separated into groups according to primary language to make sure you got the most out of the experience. Amazing range of languages offered by the guides. We were told about what to expect, given the rules and fitted up with all the necessary gear. You only need your bathing suit and lockers were provided.After a brief trek through the jungle we entered the caverns. The route is underwater to varying degrees from knee high to areas were you need to float/swim in your life jacket. The formations were just stunning and just as impressive as I had hoped. A nice lunch followed the trek back to finish off a great day.Definitely something not to miss."

Then, at the end, they try to sell you a kit with book & photo cd for mucho dinero - or just one pic for US $20 - what a joke.If you have mobility problems - I would not recommend this - you have to walk in dark conditions, in water up to your waist or higher, with rocks & stalagmites & cracks etc on the floor."

We were briefed on what to expect, given wet suits, water shoes, and flotation devices, and entered the underground caves. In places, the water was too deep to walk, but the flotation devices kept us afloat. The environment in the cave is amazing and wondrous. We had a terrific guide (Raul) who is clearly passionate about conserving this treasure. We spent about one hour in the caves followed by a tasty lunch and the requisite push to buy the photographs they took (though not a \"hard\" sell!). Caution, though, that the ground is uneven and one should be fairly nimble walking, but otherwise this is a terrific way to spend half a day (especially if cloudy or rainy)."

We booked it through our hotel, the Beach Palace and we were not disappointed. The tour through the cave was amazing and Victor, our tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable and sweet. We did not expect it to be as long either so we really felt we got our moneys worth. We also felt it wasn't as commercialized as the other excursions...meaning we really felt we were in Mayan untouched land that hadn't been built up for tourists yet. Silvia was wonderful communication and emailing us our picture too. We didn't have enough money for the pictures but we were able to use paypal and she very promptly and kindly set everything up and emailed us our picture. With that said, I will say the picture packages are outrageous and they don't allow you to take your own camera in; however, it is still worth it to buy 1 picture because it is that gorgeous inside the caves. Our other excursion that was part of the cenote/cave walking and swimming were atv riding in the jungle. Both instructors were amazing and so much fun to ride with. The path we went on was full of mudpits that were so much fun to ride through. My husband and I were laughing so hard and having the best time. We also stopped at a cenote and swam in it for about 20 minutes, and they took us into a cave to see fruit bats. The whole day was amazing and we keep talking about how incredible both tours were. We highly recommend it."

It is a bit drawn out in the beginning and at the end. Getting situated with the helmets gear and video introduction can be a bit lengthy. They also make you shower under a cool shower before going into the cave. I find this humorous because well that everything in Mexico in not so clean and after a rainfall the run off ends up in the underground anyway. At the end of the excursion they offer you a quick but very enjoyable lunch. They don't allow you to bring cameras along the trip. They have a photographer taking pictures along the way. You can buy six or seven photographs for about $70. A huge rip off. We wanted one photograph the charges $12 for it. Owen they don't give you a picture it's just a JPEG. Other than that it was a very interesting experience I would highly recommend it."

In Playa del Carmen we signed releases and then loaded into vans and drove to Rio Secreto. Once you get to the entrance of the attraction the the road does get bumpy. You change into your swim wear and you are given a locker for your belongings. They then give you all the equipment you need to enjoy this wonderful walk through a cave. The water was high, so there was one area where you actually swam for about five minutes. The water is cool not cold. I get cold easily and was ok. The rest of the time the water was no higher than waist deep. The guide was very informative and checked often on everyone. A walking stick would have been helpful in some areas (ask for one). Very pretty inside and lots to look at. Pictures are taken of each group. After the tour, you change clothes, eat lunch (good!) and are offered different options on picture purchases. We bought the CD of pictures for $69. Most of the pictures are inside the caves and specific to your group, Near the end of the disk they throw in some generic scenery pictures. Since you can not take a camera (not even a water camera) this is the least expensive option if you want photos to remember this adventure. I would recommend this. It does take about 7 hours from Cozumel and involves a ferry ride. It was nice to get away from the touristy areas and see a more natural setting. I booked the excursion through Carnival."

They provide wet suits, life jackets, helmets w/ light, lockers, and towels. Also a walking stick is provided, which I highly recommend and think it should be manatory, as they don't want you to touch anything in the cave and it's needed to help with your balance. You take place in a Mayan blessing before going to the cave. Very cool. There is a short walk through the jungle and then down into the cave you go. Some people in our group of eight, had balance issues and hip problems, so we moved a little slower then the rest of the groups. It's pretty physical you are walking up and down over rocks and into and out of water. There is no light except what is on your helmet. Our guide Daniel was great with helping the ones that had issues. You are in the cave for 1.5 hours, I could of been down there forever. Lunch is served when you get out. The food they had was very good. Pictures were $69.00 which I thought was worth it as no cameras are allowed. Each group had there own photographer. Some of the pictures just of the cave itself were special to each group. I think going to Rio Secreto was one of the highlights of our trip. My husband and I want to do the longer cave tour next time. So we will definitely be back."

(Our guide asked if this would be a problem for anyone first.) \u00a0It was completely black - you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. \u00a0It was so strange, a little scary, and very cool!They get you on the photos, but we bought the CD anyway -- we wanted a tangible memory of the experience and buying the CD was the only way. \u00a0Though I do recommend just getting the CD and not the special packages that come with other things. \u00a0My only concern about the images is that they try to tailor your photo CD so it includes the individual shots of you and your traveling companions, but ours also included a few photos of other couples, so we wonder whether we really got all of the photos of us or not, or if another couple possible had a few of ours that we didn't. \u00a0We'd rather just have all of the photos of the whole group, or at least have the opportunity to go through our group's photos with them and point out the photos of us -- especially for that price -- to ensure we got them all.\u00a0There are lockers and a decent changing facility. They provide you with shorty wet suits and water shoes. The lunch that follows is perfectly fine. Try to allow a few extra minutes to lay in the hammocks along the path before getting back on the bus - it's very serene. I would definitely recommend this excursion to explore a little of Mexico's natural beauty and geology off-resort. \u00a0"

I got a little scared a couple of times, but in a fun way, and I knew we were never in any danger. Hector gave us all kinds of interesting information and was able to answer all the questions we had. We had a wonderful time, and it really was unlike any experience I'd ever had before! I recommend Rio Secreto very highly - you won't regret it!"

            "review": "hauntingly beautiful. we took this tour as an excursion from the Norwegian jewel. It felt pricey when I booked it but turned out absolutely worth the money. Our guide was Victor who impressed us with both his knowledge and his care & concern for the preservation of the cave. They fed us a buffet lunch that was simple but really good, I think canned soda was $2 or so, reasonable enough. Trip to the site from playa del Carmen was short but the van ride over the dirt roads was rough and uncomfortable for some. They loan you a wet suit which I was sort of skeeved out by but wore anyway and didn't end up with a rash or anything. You get a life jacket and a helmet and we brought our own water shoes but if you don't then they can loan. No personal cameras inside which was kind of a downer since they charge quite a lot for the professional shots. However, the photos came out quite good and looked better than if we had taken our own anyway. This could be slightly uncomfortable for claustrophobics or arachnophobes (me) ... I just tried not to think about it and we didn't see anything till toward the end when our guide found a couple of monstrous horrible whip spiders. Fortunately they stayed on the wall and there was plenty of space to avoid them. GO FOR IT, you wont regret..."

You almost feel like the some sort of a cave monster is going to grab you at some point. It's very safe though. Our guide knew so much about the under ground river we learned tons of stuff. They don't let you take pictures but trust me if you want unique pictures you should buy them. Very eco friendly park, they truly do love what they are doing and want to protect this attraction for the future. There is authentic Mexican lunch included that was very good there is no alcohol so not a party attraction but if you want to see something you'll never forget go on this tour. It was educational a little bit of exercise and the under ground river was relaxing."

            "review": "This is a MUST-DO attraction!. I visited this \"attraction\" on a shore excursion from a Carnival cruise on October 9, 2013, and one week later I'm still in awe of the experience!First of all, I have to mention that our tour guide, Hector, was absolutely fantastic! He was very knowledgable about the cave systems, as well as the surrounding ecosystems, and he took every step to ensure that my dad (who has arthritis and isn't able to move around as well as the rest of us) was able to get around okay all the time. He was also very laid-back, yet professional, and his enthusiasm made our tour more enjoyable.The facilities (restroom, lockers, shower area, dining area, etc) were basic, however, they were clean and seemed well-maintained. The buildings construction were such that they didn't seem to be making much of an impact on the land, which is great because it gives it a more natural feel. The caves themselves seemed as untouched as possible, with no man-made lighting aside from your headlamps and the flashlight of the tour guide. There is a moment when you are able to take a seat and turn off all your lights, fully immersing yourselves in the complete darkness of the cave, only hearing the distant drips of water from the stalactites. It really is an incredible experience. Before you enter the caves, you are asked to change into a swimsuit and then step under a shower briefly to wash away any harmful chemicals or oils that may be on your skin. You are also asked to remove any metals (watches, jewelry) as they can also be harmful to the ecosystems inside the caves, but prescription glasses are okay to have, for obvious reasons. From there, you get a wetsuit, then a helmet, then a life vest, and then water shoes. After this, you're fully outfitted and are able to begin your tour (there are no rental fees for the equipment). As people have mentioned before, you aren't allowed to take any photos or video, but a photographer follows your group in the caves to take photos as you go. You are given the option to purchase these on a cd at the end (around $70 at the time). I would highly recommend the experience to anyone who visits this area of Mexico, on a cruise ship or not. I was a bit worried there would be a lot of swimming, because I'm not the strongest swimmer, but the life vest did most of the work for me, and there were only 2 areas that I needed it (we toured the Palacios \"route\"). I was also a bit worried that we might encounter some spiders along the way, but surprisingly enough I didn't really see many, and the ones I did see were far enough away that I wasn't worried (and they were small). Hector did point out a type of spider called an Amblypigids to us that was hiding in some ficus root. They look a lot more intimidating than they really are, and because they blend in so well, it's really kind of hard to see it without help from your tour guide so you won't have to worry about one sneaking up on you. The only wildlife we saw aside from that was a shrimp. I did hear some bats, but I never saw any. So, if you're thinking you might not do this because you can't swim very well and/or because of the bugs you might encounter, please, don't let that stop you! I can't say enough good things about this tour! If I return to this area of Mexico I will try my hardest to get back there and see a different cave system. It really is an amazing secret!"

This is all explained to you so if you have an issue with that, you should probably not go. Keep in mind that that you have the same thing in the states when you go on tours. Revenue keeps the place running, so you cannot have it all. I think it is very reasonably priced and our tour guide, Adriana, was amazing. If you are unsteady or afraid of enclosed spaces, this may not be for you. You are given everything you need there, wetsuit, helmet, walking stick, towels, shower, lockers, and a nice meal afterwards. Relax and enjoy the uniqueness of the experience. It is a treasure."

            "review": "Rio Secreto Underground Adventure. Just got back from Playa del Carmen, Mexico where my wife and I took an excursion to Rio Secreto, an underground river system formed due erosion of the limestone bedrock that is the foundation of this area. On arrival at the complex we were greeted by a multi-lingual host who asked us to wait until enough English-speaking clients arrived to make up a full tour party. The groups are intentionally kept small in order for the guides to be able to work with them properly. There were nine in our group, plus Joan, our guide, and a professional photographer who accompanied us and documented the tour.We started with an introductory video presentation then moved on to get our wet-suits, water shoes, life jackets and helmets complete with headlights. After a cold shower to remove any tanning lotion, oils or other substances which might pollute the pristine water we suited up and headed to the entrance. Before entering the caves we received a traditional Mayan blessing then started our adventure.I have to admit I felt a little out of my element. The organization is very protective of the area and stressed frequently that we should avoid touching the limestone formations or damaging any of the natural features we came in contact with. This doesn't sound hard but when you take into account that you are walking mostly through water on uneven surfaces with half-formed stalagmites and rock formations waiting to trip you up it gets a little interesting. Add to this the fact that water levels were quite high due to recent rains, this was to prove a challenge for a virtual non-swimmer like me.The circuit consists of wading through amazing underground passages that lead to incredible vaulted caves and beautiful rock formations. Joan proved very knowledgeable and informative and explained the geological history of the area. There were some places where I really wondered what I was doing there,especially when we were forced to paddle-swim because the water became too deep to walk. As I mentioned, being a poor swimmer at first I wasn't happy when I couldn't touch bottom, but eventually got the hang of things and started to relax.Probably the coolest part of the trip was when we gathered in one cave and everyone turned their headlamps off. You will never experience such total blackness above ground! And the total absence of light increases the power of all your other senses. Each drip of water from the ceiling becomes the most important sound in the universe, and you can almost hear the caves breathing and feel the vastness around you that you can not see.I have to say that if I had known how challenging this trip would prove before we booked, I might not have decided to go on it. As it turned out, it was one of the best experiences I have had and coming out of the cave gave me a strong feeling of personal achievement. Also the time underground helped me work up quite an appetite, so the included lunch buffet was very welcome.I would definitely recommend this excursion to anyone looking for something a little different and a little challenging."

            "review": "Unforgettable and great value.. The Amazing Secret River shore excursion (~$110/person) offered by Carnival Cruises at the Cozumel port is by far the best mid-to-high-level activity you could ask for given the value. Approx. 40 min ferry ride (with drinks available) and 20min on bus through a rough, unpaved trail (forewarning), you are brought to a hidden gem in the jungle. Well-equipped with restrooms, showers, lockers, and hammocks, the facilities are maintained better than that of a public beach restroom. The bilingual tour guides provide wet suits, life vests, and helmets, as well as optional bodysuits and walking sticks (both are highly recommended because of the cold waters and limited visibility through the dark waters.) No jewelry, cameras, sunblock, makeup, or accessories are allowed in order to preserve the water quality. Once in the caverns, you will have very limited visibility and trails are quite slippery. This adventure is not recommended for those scared of the dark or confined spaces, and it would be very difficult if you have limited walking accessibility. As avid mud-runners/active athletes, my husband and I still found ourselves quite challenged. Several times you will be forced to swim completely, although the life vests help. However, if you manage to get past a few tight squeezes, you will not regret any of it. The view within the caverns is a once-of-a-lifetime experience and surpasses any postcard you could buy. During our ~1.5h trek, we saw bats, spiders, and explored only 1 of the many cavern paths you could take. After completion, we were given a delicious Mayan meal and allowed to see/purchase our stunning photos--well worth the money ($60 for CD of all photos).If you wish to do something more natural and truly adventurous, do not miss out on this activity."

I had already seen unimpressive caves in Puerto Rico before so I was not expecting much, but aside from the long and tough travel to Rio Secreto I was surprised and happy with our choice. Rio Secreto brings an immersive and humbling experience to its visitors.Our travel time to the destination after leaving the ship was about 2 hours including a ferry ride from Cozumel to Riviera Maya and a van trip from Riviera Maya to our destination. The ferry ride was smooth with some wildlife to see on the way, but the ferry staff are right in your face trying to sell you drinks and snacks. There were some really tough, pothole-riddled gravel roads to travel down on the Van part that had you bouncing around real bad, but it was not too uncomfortable and I believe nobody was injured.The cave trip was beyond expectations; you are not just walking down some safe, well lighted carved walkway in tourism clothes while looking at cave structures with a tour guide. You have to put on gear (a lighted helmet, a wetsuit, a life jacket, and some slip proof water shoes) and you are climbing up and down rock formations and walking through and floating down underwater rivers in complete darkness where the ONLY light is coming from your helmets and a flash light that the tour guide is carrying. There is also wildlife in this cave: we saw crickets, some sort of giant arachnids, bats, and fish.While traveling in the caves, you cannot take pictures, but the staff assigns a trained photographer that follows your group through the cave and takes pictures, both unannounced and posed, through the trip. You can buy the photographs after looking at them on an iPad later outside of the cave, but they are VERY pricey ($25 for one picture or $69 for a disc with all of the pictures).There is a free buffet of traditional Mexican food and drink after the cave, but I feel that I must warn you that flies and other bugs crawl all over the food and get in the drinks since it is right out in the open with no coverings. You can also purchase soda, bottled water, or snacks at the buffet. We had a little bit of time to eat at the buffet and rest in hammocks or chairs and an hour of shopping/beach time in Riveria Maya before being ferried back to Cozumel.I will take the time to point out that our tour guide, Alfredo, was incredibly accommodating and informative. He responded to every request and out-of-place sound that somebody made and tried his best to answer every question. I definitely felt that his name was worth mentioning. There were other guides involved, but my experience with them was average at best.Rio Secreto was realistic and engaged. It you are looking for a more natural option with less commercial flair for your trip to Mexico, I am confident that Rio Secreto is a great choice."

The tour guy had tons of options, but we needed to stay within budget. Rio Secreto was one of the lower end admissions, but it was something I believed I could do since I don't like open water. Let me tell you that it was incredible. We were taken to the site, and after a very long bumpy ride to the reserve, and a very cold shower, were suited up with wet suits, water shoes, life jackets and helmets with lights. We were told of how the Mayans wanted to keep the reserve as natural as possible. We were \"cleansed\" by a local Mayan and made our descent into the caverns. You travel about 80 feet underground and for most of the time, are knee-deep or waist-deep in water, but there is a stretch where you need to swim.Our guide, Renee, was totally awesome. You could really tell that he was knowledgeable and passionate about the reserve and it made the trip so much more rewarding. He also spoke English very well.It is pitch black down there, so the helmet lights and the guide's flashlight is all you have. This is not America, where we would plow a walkway through the rock so as no injuries to occur. This is all natural and you must walk the way the guide instructs you. There are no rails. You cannot touch the rock. And because of this, the area is absolutely gorgeous. This is one of the most amazing things I have done in my life. I hope to do many more, but I am so happy that I can say that I experienced this. The earth is incredible."

You will watch an introduction that is available in most languages. Then you are loaded on to a van for the 7 km ride to the cenote. The road is very bumpy and hence very slow going. The driver must weave back and forth to avoid pot holes. We visited in September which is rainy season and perhaps that is why there were many pot holes. The trip along can be exciting if you spot an animal. We saw a tarantula making its way across the road but other than a variety of butterflies and the odd huge grasshopper that was it. Once you arrive to the cenote you are introduced to your guide. Our guide was Hector and he was amazing. You only need your swim suit on. Lockers are provided for your belongings and you keep the key. Hector had us outfitted with water shoes, wet suites, life jackets and helmets with lights. Our group was 8 people. Once we were ready we walked to the cenote and began our almost 2 hour adventure. If I can do it any one can. The journey through the cave consisted of walking through water, over rocks, under low caves, swimming or floating in deeper water and you never had your head under water. The water is pristine and the bottom easily visible. Hector guided us where to walk and all of us came out of the cave without a scratch. His knowledge of the rock formation was incredible. A photographer shadows your tour and takes pictures along the way. Afterward you may purchase the pictures on a disk. Price ranges over $100 for the disk, book about Rio Secreto and bottle of their liquor to $35 for a single picture. We went middle of the ground and purchase the book and disk for $100. It was a bit expensive but we didn't bring our own camera with us on this trip so it is the only pictures we have of our whole vacation. After the tour there is a buffet lunch of Mexican food that is very good. Then once everyone is ready you are driven back to your hotel. Or you may choice to go ATVing back to the entrance and then get on a van for your resort. This is a remarkable excursion and well worth doing."

If you have trouble walking or balancing or can't swim I suggest you do not take this trip. You are guided through knee deep water in a dimly lit cave. Only your helmet light and the guides flash light illuminate the cavern.There are many large rocks to step over and many large step offs. Some spots we had to swim. We could not feel the bottom. We were fortunate that there were just us four plus the guide in our group. I feel we got a more personal tour. They served us a meal after the tour. I didn't know we would get a meal with our trip so it was better than nothing. The food wasn't all that great but it was nice to have a beer and sit and enjoy the beautiful jungle around us. Don't miss this excursion! You will not be disappointed!!! Outstanding!"

The diving suits were wet, & my water shoes were full of holes & also wet, which I found gross, but if you can steel yourself & try not to think about it, those were pretty much the only negatives to the tour. The caves are spectacular, & our guide was personable. It was just the right length (around two hours), & being separated into language groups meant you didn't have to wait for the tour to be translated into several other languages.This tour doesn't have much replay value (I wouldn't do it again, because of the cost), & you aren't allowed to take pictures inside (they charge you an arm & a leg selling you CDs of your pictures instead), so take it all in using your senses & save it to your memory. I would definitely recommend doing this tour."

We were encouraged to do the 1.5 hour tour by our travel agent at our hotel, in passing he mentioned there is a 4 hour tour called \"privilege\" that most people don't know about but we didn't think much of it until we loved our first tour as much as we did! our tour guide was so great and made us feel like we were caving champs! Since the weather conditions were somewhat poor the week we were there we decided we couldn't pass up the opportunity to try the \"privilege tour\", wow did we make a good decision. For a very affordable price we were given the opportunity most people will never experience. We had a private tour (just my husband and myself, Rodrigo and hector our tour guides/ photographer) for four hours exploring one of the most beautiful network of caves I have ever seen! Rodrigo and Hector are amazing! Both have been in the cave at least 1000 times. Hector was one of the first to explore the cave when it was discovered and Rodrigo has a great personality and sense of direction making it the best four hours you will ever have on a tour if you have an adventurous spirit. You need to be in great physical condition, and not be claustrophobic. If you are up for an adventure do this tour! Request Rodrigo and Hector! you will not be disappointed!side note, lunch is included in the price of the tour and it is soooo good"

After doing a little research and speaking to our excursion specialist I convinced him to give it a try. Great decision!! They suit you up with wetsuits and life jackets, as well as water shoes. After a short walk through the jungle, you are gathered and blessed by a Mayan gentleman for safe passage. After entering the cenote, all I can say is \"amazing\"! The underground caves are beautiful and the swimming/floating through the deeper caverns was great. My husband felt very comfortable in the water as well. Enjoy!"

The bus ride to the Ceynote was bumpy but we actually enjoyed it. Gives you an idea of how pristine and untouched they try to keep their surroundings. They do tours in different languages and they have small tour batches which means a lot of personal attention. Our guide, Mauricio was excellent. He made extra effort to take my husband and I through the parts that required swimming (the swimming part is not really difficult, but Mauricio took extra care). We stopped at various areas where Mauricio told us some very interesting things about the formations and the marine life that exists in the caves. We had shots at the end of our tour. The changing rooms were exceptionally clean, which is always so important. They even served us a light snack (not the best food we ate in Playa Del Carmen, but decent). Overall, a wonderful experience and a 'must-do'"

My 5 year old son Otto cried all the way back to our hotel yesterday (and then some) because in his words \"I love Rodrigo so much and can't bear never to see him again.\" He's still talking about him today and begging me to purchase a $25 photo of him to join the superheroes on his wall.

We chose morning, but it was almost a full day of adventure! We were picked up at nine and returned to the resort just before four. It takes some time and several van changes to reach the underwater caves. On arrival the tour company was a well oiled machine. Visitors were divided into small groups based on preferred language for a guide. While there we heard guides speaking Spanish, English, French and Italian! If you have a language request, be sure to look into their ability to meet your needs. The guides are very respectful of the environment and ask all visitors to shower and wear water shoes (which will be supplied if you need them), a wet suit and life jacket, as well as a helmet with an attached light. You just need your bathing suit. The entire time underground is about 90 minutes, but the time flew by! If you have any concerns about mobility, be sure to take a walking stick when it is offered. I did not take one, and regretted it. It can be a bit undaunting to step into water when you can't see where you are stepping, and a walking stick would have been a big help. You don't need to be able to swim as the water never gets too deep. The company takes photos of your group as you tour the caves and then you are given an opportunity to purchase some or all of them before you leave. At the end of the tour you are served a buffet lunch before returning to your hotel. I was especially impressed by the respectful manner in which the environment was always treated. Our guide, Rodrigo, was kind, helpful, funny, informative, and above all else, protective of the caves. It was an amazing experience that I would recommend for anyone travelling in the area."

Thanks Rodrigo.I have seen a few negative remarks about the price of the photos - don't listen to these daft people. There is no way you could take good pictures of your own down there. The photos taken by the second guide are really great. For example, they use a torch to backlight the formations sometimes using a flash to light you - the result is stunning. If you begrudge 60USD for a CD with about 100 excellent photos on it then don't go - go to X-caret or some other kiddie place!"

It was a once in lifetime experience and it was a smooth trip to and from the restor to Rio Secreto. The lunch we had afterwards was very good as well, that was part of my husband's highlight of the trip, having authentic mexican food."

This is not a cenote swim. The likelihood is that you will stub your toe or incur a scratch or two, so if that bothers you, this may not be for you. Wonderful experience."

We had Victor as a guide and he was really good, we learned a lot of historical facts about the cenote. Our guide from TMR said Rio Secreto was the best cenote in Riviera Maya area, he was right ! Our trip was in French which was so great ! The water is magnificent and the stalagmites and stalactites are stunning ! After the trip, you get to eat mexican food, it is really good !! Overall, this trip is really worth the visit ! The only advice we would give you is that it is a little bit cold for young children, but perfect for teens and adults !! The whole family really enjoyed it and we highly recommend it !"

I really loved the history and background she provided not only at the beginning of the tour, but also throughout. The Rio Secreto van provided transport both to and from our resort, which was great. The video presentation we watched before being driven 7km into the jungle was very interesting, especially as we got to watch it in 3 languages :)Our group of 10 (2 couples and 2 families) had a wonderful time working together, having only met in the van on the way there. To be able to trek through a cave with really cool water was not only refreshing, but truly a one-of-a-kind experience! One of my favorite parts was sitting in one of the caves with our headlamps off, just listening to the silence. It provoked a very peaceful feeling in all of us! The buffet lunch after the tour was pretty good, and the Xtabentun shots were a great wrap up to a very fun time!If there is one weakness of the tour, it'd be the cost of purchasing photos from the tour. $25 for one photo or $65 for a CD with pics from the tour and added stock pictures was a bit steep. We passed, but it didn't diminish any of the experience we had. Hopefully we can find the iguana next time... :-)"

If you want to have a breathtaking experience in a beatiful underground world, give this a try. The guide we had, Hector, was extremely knowledgeable, personable, and took a sincere interest in ensuring our enjoyment of the tour. It is a little off the beaten path, down a long dirt road in a jungle ,but I do not know about where you live but I have yet to find beautiful underground caverns where Mayan indians frequented in my suburban neighborhood. It was truly a memorable experience. The food provided after was a nice bonus as well."

I was with a group of 9 in Playa, and there was interest by some in the group to book this excursion. I was indifferent at the time and mainly decided to go because the rest of the group was in - and since we were all together it would be good regardless, right? Well, let me tell you, this is an awesome experience and shouldn't be missed by anyone visiting Cancun or Playa. Our guide Rodrigo couldn't have been better. He was extremely passionate about exploring the underground river, was full of facts and stories, and seemed genuinely interested in making sure everyone had a great time. With our group of 9, we had Rodrigo all to ourselves - and he seemed very observant to tailor the tour based on the interest and abilities of the group. The underground caves were just discovered in 2006, so they are still in a very natural state. You'll walk and swim through the underground river and the views of the stalagmites and stalactites are breathtaking. When finished, you will be served a great, 'typical' lunch that is really quite good (lunch included, beer/soft drinks available for a very nominal fee).We booked through a travel agent at our resort, and it included transportation from the resort by Rio Secreto. Once at the entrance to Rio SecretoThere are lockers available onsite to use when changing into your wetsuit. Wear a bathing suit, and it's not a bad idea to bring some water and a change of dry clothes a well for when you're finished. Keep in mind that you cannot wear any watches or jewelry, and personal cameras are not permitted."

He helped our youngest son who wasn't a confident swimmer, through the caves and was still able to keep up a great description of the caves and their formation and sing the James Bond theme tune. The caves were beautiful and well worth a visit. I was embarrassed by our limited Spanish but there was no issue as Rodrigo's English was perfect. We were picked up from our hotel in a minivan by a very friendly driver who stopped on the way to show us a massive nest on top of a pylon. You get transported to the caves via a long bumpy trail through the jungle where you meet the guides and get kitted out in wetsuits and life jackets. A photographer accompanies you on the tour and you can purchase photos at the end after you have been given a strong shot of something that helps losen the wallet! I didn't feel that there was a hard sell though which was a good thing. There was a buffet lunch at the end which our guide talked us through and kept checking in on us to laugh at my oldest son who had tried the hot sauce. At the end of the morning we were transported back to the hotel by the same driver which I think made the experience better having that continuity."

Yes, the suits and helmets were a little stinky but I think thats because of the cleaning agents they use. The tour was amazing. I loved seeing everything and experiencing the caves and the very fresh water. Our guide Danilo was wonderful, very knowledgeable, funny, and took care of our safety. The food at the end was good. Its out in the wilderness so it was what I expected and was delicious. I can't comment about the price of pictures because there was something wrong with uploading them from the photographer's camera and although we were told we would get an email with them if we want to purchase some, we have yet to receive anything (my boyfriend and I each gave our email and neither of us have gotten anything in almost a week). I would have loved to take pictures, especially if they are very expensive or we never see any. We weren't told we couldn't bring cameras so we went out and bought a disposible waterproof one just for this."

We booked this as one of our excursions and were completely amazed by the beauty of this cave. We have done several cave tours throughout the Midwest and nothing compares to this! We all loved it-my husband, daughter (age 9) and son (age 7). My 7 year old did get pretty cold as he was in the water more than the rest of us (he is small for his age and had to swim much of the waist deep water). Everyone else was fine, the water is cool but actually feels good while you are walking/swimming the cave. Our tour guide Alfredo was great! Our kids loved him and we will request him the next time we do this-we skip all the other exursions next time but will be returning to do this one again!! Alfredo explained so much about the cave, the area and the Mayan culture. He loved his job and that came through in his passion for nature and the environment. He also went above and beyond and gave our son a piggy back ride so he would not be submerged in the water. They provided all the necessary equipment, we did opt to use our own aqua socks, but theirs would have been fine."

The Rio Secreto is an amazing underground river system that you are allowed to hike and swim through. You will see, like Carlsbad Caverns, growing stalactites and stalagmites and columns and more. I cannot recall the exact amount of time in the cave system we had, but it was close to 2-3 hours. Groups are limited to about 10 with enough separation between groups that you do not often see anyone else down there. We were fed a nice local flavor lunch afterwards. Wet suits, water shoes, helmets, lights and a locker are provided as part of the fee. Eduardo made the trip very enjoyable with his knowledge of the Rio Secreto, the local area and his general demeanor. He clearly enjoys what he is doing. The trip is great for the entire family."

The formations are spectacular to see and experience this way.We were a party of eight (4 adults/4 children). We negotiated $10 per adult to pay $90 each and $5 off per child to pay $45 each. In total it was about four and a half hours from when we left the hotel to when we returned (the excursion was 20 minutes away). Once there, it was a very slow and bumpy 7km ride (which seemed like double) to the eco site. It's a little rough. If I knew about this in advance, I made not have gone! The gear is included entirely - wetsuit, life jacket, water shoes and helmet with light as well as lockers. It's a short walk to the caves and we were inside for about two hours. Our guide was Cesar and he did a great job helping us and explaining the formations. They take safety seriously, which is good and necessary! We didn't take walking sticks, which probably would have helped. We all got a few minor scrapes -the floor is bump and walking isn't stable. We're all in decent shape, but if you're not or you don't like confined space, this wouldn't be a good choice. We did swim through a few parts, but it's mainly walking and wading. By the end the kids were shivering because the water is cool - a nice contrast from outside heat. A photographer is there to tag along and take photos. I actually would have preferred not to have this - it was a little disruptive, the photos were okay but not fantastic and they were more than I thought reasonable. None of us bought photos. The food provided at the end was fabulous. It made the price of the tour worthwhile. If eco tours and natural wonders interest you and you like exercise, then go for it!"

Our experience was really fun and our guide was really cool to and loves what he does,his name is Alfredo, so if you have a choice try to get him.

After a special native ceremony, we entered the cave. It truly was amazing. Hector, our guide, was great!

Hector made us feel at ease and helped us to enjoy the beauty and wonder of what we were seeing. We were all so happy to have him! My favorite part was actually swimming through the river with the formations all around you. So gorgeous. At the end we had a buffet lunch (which was much nicer than we expected since we were told it was just a snack), and purchased a CD of the pics they took (it cost $69! The only part of the trip that I thought was ridiculous, but we bought it because they were good pics and we wanted to remember the trip).

I cannot enthuse enough about this experience.We were on a Disney Cruise at the time and had to position by fast ferry to the mainland first; we were then subjected to a standing in the heat period of disorganisation whilst other members of the party decided to arrive and make themselves known.A short trip by van, with a/c, ended in about 5km of dirt track bumping around to the facility in the 'bush'.Our Guide was 'Leon' and from the moment he took over the experience really started; patiently we were kitted out in wet-shoes, wetsuits, bouyancy aids, helmets and head torches. All in decent condition and of good quality.your personal items are stored in lockers for the purpose and you take nothing with you at all.Brief walk along a trail, a blessing by a Mayan holy man and you're at the cave entrance.There is a reassuring chat again about what we are to see, expect and the rules about what to touch and where not to go.The journey is about 90 minutes and for me I could have gone on for hours more. It was an unbelievable privilege to to visit the river, caverns and see the wildlife living in this environment of total darkness.Leon was patient and took time to answer all our questions, gave us time to keep together and allowed us to stay longer in some of the most beautiful places I have ever visited.Alongside is a company photographer setting us up for some posed pictures, no obligation to purchase.I had with me my six year old daughter and I was very comfortable with how it was ran and she will remember this for the rest of her life.At the end you emerge up a staircase right by those lockers storing your personal items!The meal after is basic but of high quality; the photos are for sale, expensive as single prints but for the cost of three you can actually get an excellent CD of all your family pictures only plus some extra library photos of the flooded caverns and the wildlife you may have been lucky to see.If you do this trip and don't enjoy it, contact me and I'LL give you your money back!"

            "review": "Uniquely Different, Truly Amazing!. I\u2019ll begin by saying that on the 8 cruises I\u2019ve done this by far was, if not the best shore excursion I\u2019ve ever done. It is totally unique and different than other excursions offered for most Caribbean cruises and very cultural for the region.Getting there- The area of the Cave Hike is about 20 mins from the Cruise ship ferry pier in Playa Del Carmen. We were meet there, filled out some paperwork and off we went. Some on Trip Advisor complain about the road you go down to get to the area of the hike. Its not that bad folks, it\u2019s bumpy, its off road and we all had a blast driving down it.The facility- The facility is rather pretty with a nice jungle escape feel to it. They provide you with all the equipment you need, wetsuits, water shoes, life jackets, and then towels for when you\u2019re done with the hike. They also had a wonderful included hot lunch for the groups prior to leaving. The food was very good in fact. We didn\u2019t expect that to be included and were rather glad it was.The Hike- We did the two hour hike, they do offer a 5 hour but being we were on a cruise you have to be back on the ship at a certain time. It\u2019s very hard to put into words the beauty of the cave and hiking through the river. It\u2019s simply amazing and a pure sensory experience. The hike itself isn\u2019t simple yet it\u2019s not overly difficult either. If you\u2019ve hiked before, can swim, and are in decent shape you\u2019ll do fine and enjoy this. You are guided through the caves and our guide (Eduardo) was fantastic! The rock formations above, below, and all around you are amazing. You just can\u2019t wrap your head around how nature formed these.Pictures- So let me address the no camera policy. Very simply folks it would be impossible without professional water proof gear for you to take pictures. The Caves are pitch black and the only light is from your helmet light. Plus you are hiking in neck deep water at times. They take pictures of you and the pictures are rather good. They have several options for you to purchase the pictures that include other professional pictures of the caves a book or shirt and hat. I found it highly worthwhile and I\u2019m glad I bought the pictures. Prices range from $25 to a bit over $100. I did the $90 package which included pictures, a shirt and hat. Overall- If you are tired of the typical excursion on a cruise then do this, it\u2019s amazingly different and something you\u2019ll always remember. This is a 5 star rating all the way!"

            "review": "Unexpected Authenticity. This was a totally unexpected and wonderfully authentic experience. I had cynically assumed that all tourist activities in this part of Mexico were both overpriced and touristy, leading to underwhelming experiences. You join the group, and take a very bumpy, 20 minute ride out to a remote area. There are a few buildings, lots of trees, and some very rickety facilities. Everyone showers off the sun screen and other chemicals (we didn't put any on that day), then don a wetsuit and lifejacket. Next, you take a short hike through the jungle and start your descent into the cave system. You will need to be physically fit enough to do some climbing, swimming, treading water, staying balanced, and sustaining these activities over an hour.This is experience can not be recreated, and I almost wish it wasn't destined to become so popular. It was absolutely gorgeous, exciting, and had me wanting to go right back underground when we were finished all too soon.Afterwards, we had a nice, Mayan lunch with fiery salsa (and we're from Texas - not wimps!) We bought a photo, and considered the inflated price a donation to help conserve the caves."

            "review": "Rio Secretto Caves and a bit about Tulum. Done a day trip combined with Tulum and finished with the afternoon at Rio Secretto Caves. I am a lifelong adventurer and have caved on many occasions in a variety of locations, so I said I would give Rio Secretto caves a go, under the belief that they were going to be somewhat false, commercialised, altered for the tourist etc, but I must say I was wrong.On arrival I got the sense of here we go again another commercialised Mexican tourist rip-off but quite shortly I realised once check-in was done that the place was not what I thought it would be.We were told in advance our guides name (Alfredo) and we were grouped with a family from Texas and two German lads and it was a perfect group size, from a safety ratio and from the point of view that we got real good personal attention from our assigned guide.Anyway after a short wait a bus arrived and we all boarded for a bumpy 5-6 km trip to the cave site through the jungle. On arrival we were promptly kitted out in wetsuits, helmets with lamps, shoes and buoyancy aids and the facilities were quite good and to a high standard.From the onset I got a great sense of passion from our guide Alfredo and it became apparent quite quickly that this guy was an honest, passionate, caring individual and was actually quite knowledgeable about his pursuit which I was extremely happy about and this for me made quite a difference to the whole caving experience.We entered the cave and I was absolutely delighted that no alterations, damage or any stupid tourist gimmicks were carried out and the cave was in excellent condition throughout. Our guide Alfredo was at pains to ensure that we caused no damage and he watched out for everyone with diligence.The cave is a high percentage water covered from ankle to knee to waist to chest deep water in places and extremely safe at all times. there was one or two water course sections that were about 15ft deep and no problem at all, your buoyancy aid does all the hard work for you and you just gently propel yourself along, of course there are several dry sections and I felt the balance between the wet and dry sections was just right.We exited the cave after about 21/2 hours and we went back to a jungle camp area where a buffet and drinks were included in the price. During the cave trip a staff photographer accompanied us and photographed us on the journey. But if you are keen to do your own photography ONLY bring a waterproof camera with you as you will be neck deep in water, so any other camera is at risk of water damage.This was a worth while trip and lacked the usual Mexican hassle and bother that accompanies other trips and for the first time ever in Mexico, yes for the first time ever, not one member of the Rio Secretto staff looked for a tip, or hinted or suggested a tip, this really impressed me and so much so the guide got a good tip.Now for the down side, firstly, the cost is unusually high $99USD, but I got Tulum included for $1USD extra on the same trip so that was not too bad.The photography that was done by the resident photographer was quite overpriced and on viewing the copy's I felt that they were not of a great standard, I mean the scenery was lovely in the photo's within the cave but the photographer lacked any imagination where we were concerned and I saw nothing special at all and for the price...no thanks.The jungle area of the food buffet was really nice but the food was only at average and nothing special here at all, drinks were also available free, but you could purchase a beer or a coke or other branded sodas for a very reasonable cost at the camp area.Overall a lovely experience and if you are not looking for the typical touristy, gimmicky, plastic Mexican experiences then Rio Secretto is worth the visit, and if you are coming all the way down from Cancun then visit Tulum as well, and if you want a nicer archaeological experience then skip Chichen Itza if you are planning it, do Tulum instead as you will be scourged by parasitic annoying vendors inside the archaeological site at Chichen Itza selling absolute rubbish from China masquerading as \"genuine\" Mayan art and ruining your guides explanation of the site with silly wooden toys making fake jaguar noises. Not the case at Tulum, vendors are kept away from the site and that's really a big plus for Tulum."

            "review": "Amazing experiece!. This was a surprise excursion that my friend had organised on our cruise on the Disney Fantasy ship. He was so excited about going but wouldn't tell me until we got there, and everyone he spoke to was so excited for us as word gets around that this is a great excursion to go on.And they're not wrong.What an absolutely fantastic day. As part of the excursion through Disney Fantasy, you're taken to Playa Del Carmen by boat from Cozumel and escorted to the site by road. You're given lockers to put your stuff in (free of charge), and then provided all your gear - wet suit, wet shoes, life vest and helmet. You're separated into small groups which enter different parts of the caves and you're accompanied by a guide and a photographer (who will take anyone back to base camp should the need/desire arise).The caves are pitch black and the only illumination comes from the lights in your helmet, making this such an atmospheric experience. Our guide, Rene, was fantastic, and would stop occasionally to give details about the caves and the fauna that live there. At certain spots throughout the cave, you'll stop to have professional pictures taken with whomever you came on the trip with. It wasn't until I saw these pictures that I could fully appreciate the beauty of these caves thanks to flash photography. The results were stunning and the pictures turned out fantastic.At the end of the walk/wade/swim through the caves, you give your gear back and you're given a complimentary shot of liqueur (or soft alternative..) and the chance to buy your photos (the whole package is worth it in my opinion as the photos are stunning). Then lunch is provided! It was a 'simple' lunch, but very tasty, and a nice touch to end the trip. Once we'd finished lunch, we had a chance to lounge around in the hammocks while waiting for our transport to arrive to take us back to the port, where we had spare time to wonder round the shops and beach before being escorted back onto the boat to get back to the ship in Cozumel.All in all, an absolutely fantastic trip that is great for everyone - couples, families, friends, solo etc. Nothing to be scared about going in the caves. On my particular the visit, the water levels were quite low as it hadn't rained in a while so most of it was walking or wading through water with only a couple of times where we had to 'swim' (inverted commas as you have a life vest so very little effort needed to move yourself along!). There's no tight gaps or anything like that you have to work your way through.100% recommend."

You will not come out of it the same as you went into it; definitely worth doing!Rio Secreto is a network of caves connected by an underground river on a Mayan nature preserve. The site is absolutely amazing!Visited with my cousin as part of a cruise trip we took. Refreshingly, the tour included a marked respect for the land & local culture, replete with a brief silent nature walk and a pleasant smudged meditation prior to entering the caves. This is not just some big commercial enterprise looking to cash in on natural beauty, but a locally owned & operated window into a truly magical place.We found the gear was clean, modern & well kept, with more than adequate selection for various sized people, and the staff were attentive and helpful, esp. our guide Victor who engendered a real sense of camaraderie and team-spriit in our otherwise motley group. By the end, we were all friends, helping each other and joking around.On top of all of this, was a tasting of local Mayan anise rum (very tasty) and a tranditional Mayan meal! Offering up buffet-style, we enjoyed various rice, meat, fish and vegetable entr\u00e9es\u2026. it was SOOO DELICIOUS. Esp. the sauces; if you go, don't forget to try the hot one! :)Only minor gripe is the add-on photo package seemed a little over-priced at first, but in fairness, there was a professional photographer on the tour with us, and he did a great job of capturing not only the nascent group as we navigated the unfamiliar caves, but the natural beauty of the site as well. We opted for the photo package that included up to 3 souvenirs (choosing 3 bottles of the tasty rum!), so was definitely worth picking up the extra mementos. Looking forward to returning for the longer 4hr excursion!Definitely recommend this tour if you're in the Playa del Carmen area!"

The experience was unlike anything I think you could experience in the United States, although whether the accessibility of the cave to tourists will ultimately be a detriment to its preservation is a little suspect. The tours require moderate effort, including mild hiking and swimming. There are nooks and corners that require some flexibility.No photography is allowed within the cave, although something like a GoPro would be manageable; the restriction seems to stem more from their selling photographs as souvenirs than anything else.A hearty, buffet-style lunch was provided as a part of the cruise excursion (it wasn't clear whether this is included in all tours), as were shots of a honey-based liquor they also sell as souvenirs. Beverages, including soda and beer, were extra.It was an outstanding experience, and the guide was clearly passionate about the cave system."

The passion and respect for the sensitive ecosystem of the cave made an impression on our boys who were later upset to see billboards advertising ATV rides through cave that other companies were promoting. The coolness of the cave and the 72 degree water was refreshing. We didn't opt for wetsuits but in retrospect might have for our youngest because being shorter than everyone else he was swimming up to his neck in many parts where the rest of us were walking so by the end he was shivering although it didn't lessen his enthusiasm for the experience."

Beautiful stalagmite and stalactite growths during the hike - along with views of a few bats as we disturbed their sleep a bit. Our guide, Raoul, was very informative and entertaining at the same time. Small groups (no more than ten) allowed for more conversation and discussion. It is a moderate difficulty hike, with the largest challenge begin the uneven footing and hidden rocks under the surface. However, when we were there, a number of groups had kids from ~10 years one and they did not seem to have any problems. Very nice break / change of pace from the heat of the beach. Suggest looking online with excursion agents / brokers to book, which will save money compared to booking at the hotels - door-to-door pick-up and drop-off is standard. Do bring mosquito spray for the short hike through the jungle to get to the cave entrance. Adequate lunch was provided after the hike. Unfortunately, the pricing for the pictures (photographer joined on the hike) was much too high; we ended up splitting a package with another couple. The pricing on pictures is the real weak point of this excursion, as you would like to commemorate the trip, but the prices are extortion-level.Enjoy"

It is well organized, taking small groups (no more than ten people) into a partially flooded cave. The trip consists of both walking and swimming, with a guide that explains the cave's ecology.The service and the attention are excellent. We arrived a little bit before our reservation time and were quickly send on their bus to cave, 20 minutes on an unpaved road. After that, we were given our equipment (wet suit, helmet with light, life jacket, and water shoes). Our group of ten was accompanied by a guide, Victor, and a photographer, Miguel.\u00a0The tour is quite interesting and unlike anything that I have done before. The water is cool but pleasant after the heat of outdoors. Most of the water is waist deep for an adult. At times, you do have to swim; the life jacket is high quality and this was not a problem.\u00a0After the cave, they show you the photos and then give you a light lunch. Then back to the highway again on the bus.The service was good and the tour was well organized. The equipment was first rate. We left a backpack in the truck and when we called them a few hours later, the driver (Zeus) found it. Rio Secreto sent it back to the hotel a few hours later! You don't get this service everywhere!The photos are a bit expensive (US$69) for a CD with a lot of photos, but this is par for the course and the photos are not copied protected. They could probably improve their service by putting the photos online instead of using a CD. Don't take this trip if you have a mobility problem, as there is a lot of walking and crouching. The kids in our group generally liked the tour but at time complained about the cold water and the walking.\u00a0Highly recommended"

The stick saved me quite a few times. Don't know how some folks in our group did it without the walking stick. The cave was truly stunning and the experience of sitting in total darknesss for a moment was priceless. We were in the cave for about 1 1/2 hours and the time went by very quickly. No cameras are allowed and they do have a photographer following you around but the photos are quite expensive at $25.00 for a single photo.

            "review": "Awesome half-day trip!. We went on this with our 5 and 10 year old children and it was fantastic. My daughter was dying to do a swim with the dolphins with her cousin but I don't feel those are humane to the animals. Last minute the other family switched their plan and I had to make good on my promise that we'd do something else cool at the same time. I was able to make same day reservations and we all thought it was amazing. Even the ride from the staging area by the highway to the cenotes was neat, as there was an incredible number of butterflies to watch. The caves are beautiful and fascinating. Our guide Benito had a remarkable depth of knowledge. He was also good with our 5-year-old, who he kept next to him the whole time. Sometimes it's hard to know how much is talk and how much is real, but they seem genuinely committed to preserving and respecting this resource. The Maya blessing beforehand actually seemed respectful of the culture rather than cheesy. Minor details: you're going back and forth between walking and floating frequently, so each time you get back in you get cool water in your wetsuit. The kids got chilly towards the end, but it's the perfect activity to do in the heat of midday. Skip the transport if you have multiple people -- we paid $30 round trip for taxis from central Playa del Carmen and would have paid $90 (and spent more time in transit) for their van. And as everyone else mentions, the photos are a rip. All in all though it's beautiful, shows you something you won't see anywhere else in the world, and does it in a way that tries to be sustainable and responsible. That's a rare combination in these parts!"

Our tour guide, Lia (Argelia), was really awesome and did a great job talking about the cave and keeping the group together. She did an excellent job explaining how the cave was formed, about stalactites/stalagmites/columns, small animals in the cave (shrimp and small fish in the water and bats), and she was great about letting us know where to avoid sharp rocks and where to step to keep our footing). She also spoke French in addition to her English and Spanish which I thought was really cool. We were probably down there over an hour, but I didn't have my watch on. Everything was provided (shoes, wetsuit, life vest, and helmet with light). The inside was BEAUTIFUL. It was absolutely worth it to see the cave. I have gone into caves before and this was by far my favorite. Lockers were provided with keys (you can wear the key around your neck). A professional photographer followed us around but we didn't end up buying the pictures because they were super expensive. ($25 for a SINGLE photo and $70 for a package of 8 or something). The food at the end was good but VERY spicy. I'm used to pretty spicy food but have never tried anything with a haba\u00f1ero pepper in it and I was caught by surprise by it. However, I liked the food buffet."

The kids were apprehensive about going underground in the dark for all of two minutes, right up until our guide, Enrique, started talking...he was simply phenomenal. From that moment on, we were all entranced with his stories of the cave, the history, the animals, the formations, and what they knew and still didn't know about the site. An absolute must see. You do have to be fairly limber in a few places, but the overall experience is so worth the few minutes of \"eep factor\" it simply adds to the experience, not distracts from it."

You do have to have pretty good balance and mobility or I do not think you would enjoy this. You spend about an hour and half in the cave walking or swimming in crystal clear water. I took my 11 and 13 year old daughters and they really enjoyed it. We worked up quite an appetite and we enjoyed an authentic Mexican food buffet afterwards. We loved our tour guide who was both helpful and knowledgeable in the cave. We hope you get a chance to experience Rio Secreto. You will not be disappointed."

Inclusive of the price is wetsuits, water shoes if you need them(we brought our own:), helmet with light and life vest. Everyone gets a locker for your personal items as well.The only major drawback is you are not allowed to bring your own camera witch really disappointed me. I have done a lot of caves tours and all have allowed me to bring my own camera and I ended up with great shots. They do have a photographer that follows you in and you are offered a package on CD but it was a bit steep for what you get.Before you enter the cave, there is a ceremony with local mayans who bless you before your journey. This was very cool. The water is about 75 degrees(very nice if it's a hot day). You spend about an hour and a half with your guide. Some areas are a bit difficult to walk on as the ground is uneven and under water. I am not a great swimmer, but this is not a problem as your life vest keeps you afloat.If you are claustrophobic, it may seem a bit nerve wracking but it is not bad at all. At the end of your journey, they offer a mexican lunch of tacos, rice, beans, fruit, etc. Definitely worth the visit:)"

The tour guide had tons of interesting information to share. The disappointment is that you can't take a camera (which I understand) and they charge an arm and a leg for the photo packages at the end of the tour. The meal that was provided was fresh and well made but limited. The process from beginning to end is well thought out and the groups are nice and small. So if you're satisfied with being unable to come away with any pics then go and have a WONDERFUL time. For me it was well worth it - an experience I will always remember."

Me my Husband and 2 Daughters, age 11 and 18 visited Rio Secreto on Monday JUNE 17th 2013 and it just happened to be a rainy day(which was PERFECT) because we were under ground. This place was MAGICALLY BREATH TAKING, something you would ONLY expect to see on a NATURE channel in the comfort of your own HOME. To see and experience this place up close and personal was AMAZING. The water was crystal clear and WARM.... Our Tour Guide was amazing and very engaging and knowledgeable. Our group consisted of 8-people + 1 Camera Man. I would definitely recommend this tour for ALL(even the NON swimmers). All you have to do is show up with your swim suit, they provide the wet suit, Life Vest, protection helmet with Light, swim shoes & a secure locker for your personal belongings. We purchased the packed that included the CD ONLY that included(50+ pictures of my family along with the other Tourist as well). Unfortunately they will NOT allow you bring your own camera to take your own snap shots. The only thing I would suggest for \"RIO SECRETO\" is to invest in better camera's with more clarity(Especially considering this underground cave is COMPLETE DARKNESS without any light) The pictures were very AVERAGE and considering this is a once in a life time experience and the amount they charge $65+(with NO print outs, only a CD) the quality should be TOP NOTCH...... Other than that this place is SOOOOOOO worth seeing. ((You will feel like you're part of History when you leave this place))!!!! Sincerely, LaShonda W. & Family"

            "review": "Educational, spiritual, amazing!. We chose this excursion because it is unique to the Riviera Maya. As a scienc-y person, learning about the cenote and swimming through it sounded intriguing.I really liked that the tour sizes were very small. I think we had 8 people in our tour and that was one of the larger groups!Our guide was phenomenal. He was extremely knowledgeable and made the entire experience great. I have since forgotten his name.You start by getting changed into the appropriate gear - be warned the shower is COLD!Before entering the cenote, there is a traditional Mayan Blessing, which I found very interesting. You then enter the cenote, which is honestly spiritual and majestical. It is amazing to think that you are wading through a cave that has only recently been discovered, but has existed for thousands of years. Our tour guide taught us about the type of creatures found in the cave, how the geological formations came to be, and educated us about the importance of keeping the cenote a natural reserve.My favourite part of the tour came just before we turned around to exit the cenote. We turned off all of our head lamps and the guide turned off the flash light. We were in complete darkness - something that I have NEVER experienced before, and likely never will again. It was amazing.After the tour we had a shot of a special honey liquor, and had lunch. Lunch was traditional Mayan fare. It was nice.The only downside was the photos. The cost for the photos seemed outrageous to me. My fiance and I agreed that we had the memories to last a lifetime and did not need the pictures to aid in those memories. The only downside**TIP #1** TAKE THE WALKING STICK! One of the men in our tour group said he read on trip advisor to take the stick. TAKE IT. My fiance and I are 26 and 27 and thought we wouldn't need them. I am so glad I had one, as the ground is very uneven and there could have been many times I could have fallen.**TIP#2** do not take any jewelry with you into the cenote. The water is COLD. Fingers shrink, rings fall off. If that ring or other piece of jewelry falls off you will never find it - it is very dark."

ONE word of advice - If you're going to go on the water taxi from Cozumel to Playa del Carmen (port of entry for this excursion) PACK YOUR motion sickness pills...a bit wavy and bumpy by nature. No pictures allowed other than what they take of you and sell at a premium [this is a tiny bummer - but business is business I guess].Other than that, the actual tour was amazing.My son commented \"Mom on a scale from 1-10 this trip is infinity\".

I really hate for my first review to be negative one, but I thought I should let my fellow tripadvisors know about our recent experiences at the rio secreto.\u00a0First, the tour itself is highly enjoyable. Our guide Hector did a great job guiding us through the cave. The food at the end of the tour was also a nice touch. Overall, I echo the sentiments of the other positive reviews here. If I could rate the tour by itself, it would be 5 stars.\u00a0Now for the not so good. When we arrived back to the parking lot, we opened the trunk of our rental car to find that all of our carry-on luggage was gone. Apparently someone had broken into our trunk while we were on the tour. The parking lot is a 20 minute van ride from the caves and easily accessible from the main road. There are signs disclaiming any liability in the parking lot for items stolen from your car, so perhaps we should have taken additional precautions. But they only have small lockers at the cave site, so it's unclear what you should do if you have larger luggage and don't want to leave them in your car.\u00a0We told the people working at the ticket booth what had happened, but they were incredibly unhelpful (the person working there even said, \"well, anyone can access the parking lot\"). We asked them to call the police for us. They made one attempt, nut they told us they were unable to get through to them. In reality, we knew that our luggage was probably gone for good, but it would have been nice if they had tried a little harder to help us.\u00a0Lesson learned: Don't leave anything of value in the trunk of your car while in Mexico, especially at the Rio Secreto.\u00a0"

I was initially a little worried about the possibility this might be too cold and I wouldn't have a great experience. Before we went into the caves, we had to shower off in water from the river. It was about 70 degrees and my husband and I actually decided not to wear wetsuits. We were fine and found the water in the caves to be very refreshing. Our guide, Alfredo was amazing. He knew so much about the caves and could answer the most simple or complex questions. He has such a passion for Rio Secreto and it showed. Once you arrive at Rio Secreto, you have to take a van about 15 minutes into the forest. You then get to the area where you put on your swimsuit and gear up for the caves. You are given a helmet with a light on it, water shoes, a life jacket and you have the option of wearing a wet suit. You are asked to shower off, to keep contaminants from getting into the water. We then walked about 10 minutes down to the cave openings. Once you walk in, you are in a different world. The water is crystal clear. The stalagtyes and stalagmytes are likes works of art. Our guide led us through caves and into rivers that we floated across. At one point, we all sat down in a shallow spot and turned off our lights. It was so dark, we couldn't see our hands in front of our faces. The water was so clear, when a light was placed in the water, the light traveled forever. Our guide showed us the small fish that live in the river, the plankton the fish feed on, and the small bugs that have adapted to live in total darkness. It was amazing. At some points, you can find roots growing down into the cave from the forest floor above. It was an amazing experience. You can't take cameras into the caves. The guides, however, take pictures of everyone. Given the lighting in the caves, this is actually one time where I really appreciated someone taking pictures for us. They knew exactly where to take pictures so we could see the wonder of the caves. When we bought our photo CD, it also had a bunch of other beautiful cave pictures on it. When you meet the guides, and hear their passion about what they do, you really don't mind spending a little extra there to support their cause. Hats off to this tour - you thoroughly impressed us!!!! If you like your guide, give him or her a tip. They work very hard!!!"

They gave us eight our own group, which was great. If you like nature and like series like BBC earth and National Geographic, this is a must see. The caves are very beautiful and to actually being able to swim through them makes this an unique experience. You just can not compare this with any other cave system, because most of them are also accessible with a wheelchair and lack the experience.Hector was our guide and he did a great job. Besides overwhelming us with information about the underwater system he was also a very funny guy.I would suggest bringing your own water shoes. Cameras are not permitted, even if your camera is better than what the crew uses you would never create pictures like the ones available, as you 'll lack the lighting created by all the external flashes. Furthermore you can't expect the group to wait while you are taking pictures. I do think that the pricing on the pictures is a bit rough. However, if they are really the non profit organization that they say they are, I'm fine with that."

After I paid almost 60USD per person (in great discount), we were forbidden to enter with a camera. They have own photographer, photos were nice. But... It is very annoying to pay another 100USD for all our photos after paying this big entrance fee (or we can bought one photo for 25USD). Equipment was not in the best condition. At least, that guide was a nice man for the job and the snack was quite good, although it was relatively small selection. It was really nice, but low value for such huge money - totally overpriced commercial attraction. If I could choose again, I would not go for this entry fee."

The above ground facilities are very rustic and add to the adventure that awaits us. My wife and I are both over 65 and in good physical condition, this is a necessity for this endeavor.After the introductions about the conditions that lay ahead, you're given wet-suits, water shoes and life vests. The only \"downside\" of the Tour is; the water shoes do not give much comfort on the rocky, sharp limestone trails and when inside the cave! Hips and knees are definitely challenged during this excursion, but the bottoms of your feet are really sore, even bruised, especially the next day. I'm not sure exactly what could/would be done different on this, perhaps allowing water sandals instead of the thin water shoes??We thoroughly enjoyed the experience, saw some incredibly beautiful cave formations and a couple of really rare little blind shrimp. The Tour Is not to be missed!!!"

We saw lots of flying fish. We were then split into vans for groups. The van ride is very bumpy but I like to think that adds to the fun.We arrived at the location and were told that we needed to shower off to preserve the river and the formations and then were given wet suits, helmets, and water shoes. There are lockers to put all your belongings in.Before entering the cave we were blessed during a Mayan ceremony. Our guide was VERY passionate about the caves and the beauty and the preservation. I felt he was great in explaining things, answering questions and guiding us. I have been in a lot of caves but this one impressed me the most. It was beautiful, the river running through it was fun to swim, wade and walk through. It was rough terrain and you really needed to watch your footings but again, this is what makes it an adventure. If it had railings or lit walkways it just wouldn't be a natural cave and nearly as beautiful. If you are worried about your footings they do offer a walking stick at the beginning. Take it, it will be helpful! I did not and did fine.After going through the river you get a lunch provided. It was a good simple buffet. Cameras are not allowed but they take great pictures inside the caves with your group and individual shots along the way. Pictures are pricey but we bought all of them on a zip drive and I think they are well worth it. They capture the cave beautifully. Now to customer service: We got home and our zip drive didn't work with our pictures we'd paid about $75 for. I was worried that they would be a lost cause and that we'd never see them. I gave it a whirl and contacted them via the web site. They worked hard to find the correct group, correct individual pictures and we received them all emailed to us in quick time. I was very impressed. I give this group and the experience 5 stars."

He didn't miss a detail, gave us fun facts, tips to navigate and made it more fun than words can say. We booked other experiences, the dolphin and Isle Mujeres and this was by far the best. I was a little nervous to start as our youngest cannot swim, it was not an issue. Rodrigo not only made the adventure fun, but memorable; he took us on the 'supreme' trail and it was amazing. Do not miss this adventure! If you have to pick between Rio Secreto and something else, choose Rio Secreto - you will not be sorry. They also provided lunch, iced tea/water and of course, great fun! We want to personally thank them for making our family vacation unforgettable."

Many have complained about not being allowed a camera. I understand this. However, my camera (which shoots in RAW and has underwater housing) would have taken better photos than the ones that we got on the CD of us. Most of them were slightly blurry or out of focus (including the ones of the Mayan Blessing which were done in outdoor lighting) and they were very small (5x7ish), so I can\u2019t even print out a nice size picture of us in the caves. Perhaps our photo quality was a fluke since others seem not to have an issue. For a scrapbooker though, the quality (not the price) of our photos is worth losing a star. Also, the bumpy ride in the van was bearable and adventurous, but there was a strong exhaust fume smell that made me a little ill in combination with the road. We had a different van back, and it was better.Everything else was fabulous. We did find the wet suits and hard hats to be a little smelly, but they are wet all day, and I was determined not to let that spoil our adventure. Our guide was Lia and she was very nice and knowledgeable with a calm, soothing voice perfect for inside the caves. We enjoyed the Mayan blessing before entering the caves. The caves were delightful, and they have done such a good job trying to keep it unpolluted that I almost hated being down there putting my footprints on the paths and my body oils into the water.Definitely take the walking stick that is offered. I found it helpful to plant for support when walking on some of the uneven areas or stepping down into the water. We were allowed to wear our own all terrain water shoes (Keene H20s), and we were very glad as they have better arch support and soles than what is offered by the tour. There were some shower facilities, so if you bring some soap, you can wash off the smell when you are done with your tour. They do provide towels, so if you are on a cruise, you do not need to bring any from the ship. One couple had their own head lamps, and the tour guides had no issues with them putting theirs on over the one they provide. This gave us some extra light which was really nice. The water was cold, but one easily adjusts to it and the further away from the earth surface, the warmer the water felt. The lockers have one key that you take with you into the caves, so don\u2019t worry about leaving your possessions there.The caves were fascinating and fabulous. I\u2019m not sure you could do anything like this in the U.S. because as soon as one person got a scratch, there would be safety laws requiring paths and steps and safety lighting and such. Hopefully, the Mexican government will allow this natural site to remain as pristine and untouched as possible. My husband and I hope to get back before laws and regulations and commercialism destroys this natural beauty."

There was more hiking than I expected (and I am not a good hiker at all). I thought there was going to be more swimming than there was (I am a very good swimmer), but that was ok.

Our group was small, at 7, which was ideal. We were well kitted out with helmets, shoes (ignore the comment on the brochure about having to bring your own), life jacket and stick, which is very necessary over rough terrain underwater. I chose not to take the offered wetsuit, as the water temperature does not warrant it. I am glad I did not need it. There are no paved walkways underground and the going can be little difficult in one or two places. Our guide, Julian, was bilingual, in Spanish and excellent English, and very informative. I was very impressed with the unostentatious help he gave one less able member of the group. The tour took just under two hours and was followed by a drink and buffet lunch. My only gripe was with the outrageous cost of single photos. At $69 for a CD of all 39, a charge of US$25 for one is a rort! One comment: the aquifer is low in water for two reasons: low rainfall over Yucatan and hotels and towns along the coast drawing on it. Time for some desalination and regulation, were it not for powerful but selfishly greedy vested interests!"

The paths in the caves are very \"natural\", and when you walk you want to grab something to help your balance (and the only things to grab are the stalactites- which is a no no!). 2. when you are eating lunch, stay clear of the hot sauce.

            "review": "2nd visit to an underground wonder of the world. Obviously this being our second trip, we knew what to expect and our only concern was that we didn't have to explore the same section of river as last year. We made the request online and crossed our fingers. We had seen the \"Snakesmouth\" section in 2012 and this year we got to see the original section that was first discovered by the property owner in 2006 which was called \"Supreme\". Yayo was our guide and explained the section and formations quite well. Being a type A personality I couldn't help but add additional information that I had either researched or learned from Francesca on our first visit. But was able to bite my tongue after awhile and just enjoy the experience. I disagree with other posts that say that you MUST use a provided walking stick. If you are still fairly stable on your feet and in your 50's or younger, we didn't see the need. If the guide is moving too fast, just continue at your own rate, they'll wait for the group...no hurry. In the two trips that we've made, only one guy (who has a back problem) has used the walking stick. Yes the footing is uneven and you have to watch your step but on both occasions, though all strangers, the groups all helped each other out. Holding the hands of the older ladies over the rough parts and pointing out any underwater hazards. Teamwork just comes naturally on these life enhancing expeditions! One tip that I will include is, on this trip, the guide gave the group the option of NOT wearing the wetsuits. Half the people took him up on this. We were glad to wear the suits as the water is a little chilly in just a bikini or shorts and they were all complaining whenever we had to float for any length of time. Another tip.......DON\"T pass up doing this excursion. It's awesome and if you've never done anything like it before, you'll never forget it. Yes, some of it is a little commercial and yes the picture posing is a bit of a pain and expensive but it also costs a lot to maintain and further explore the system. It will someday be recognized as a UNESCO world heritage site! Also, like anywhere in Mexico, tip the guides, they really appreciate it and probably don't make a lot in wages. One last observation, we enjoyed the \"Snakesmouth\" section a little more because there was more floating along with the current of the river with your knees up relaxing and taking in this wonder of the world."

At the outset, I am an experienced hiker and did spelunking many years ago. The cave itself is wonderful: large stalagmite/ stalactite formations with many amazing intricacies including cave pearls, formations which appear to be defying gravity, delicate layered formations along standing water bodies, etc as well as fairly abundant blind crayfish, spiders, bats, and other life. The experience is wild; no paved paths, electric lighting, railings, or signs which to me was a nice concept. After donning a helmet (with an inadequate head lamp), wetsuit, and very flimsy footware, you travel along very rough and wet paths in the cave, and at one point one must swim perhaps a hundred years in deep water to reach another trail. For a cave enthusiast, this cave had some wonderful cave formations, but the inadequate lighting supplied and the fairly fast pace of the group prevented a real appreciation of the formations. Though this was also meant to be an adventure, the really flimsy required footware on the very rough and slippery trails and underwater obstructions (rocks, holes) caused unwelcome distractions since one had to pay full attention to safely moving about on too many occasions rather than enjoying the cave. When suiting up before the walk began, the guide noted walking sticks were available but optional. Make no mistake about it- YOU NEED A WALKING STICK!! One cannot maintain a 3-point walking stance without one. Finally, the frequent stops to take posed photos was annoying, taking up far too much time better used to enjoy this unique visit. BTW, a single picture is $25 or a CD of the pictures taken is $60. Very commercial! In retrospect, the tour was part nature-part adventure, but the owners did not do either one real well. Perhaps separate types of tours would be more gratifying, depending on one's interests. I know I was disappointed after anxiously awaiting the visit to Rio Secreto for several months."

And to learn at the end that we had only traveled a half a mile from our starting point and there were 17 1/2 miles we didn;t see was even more amazing.Our guide (Rodrigo) was amazing, even holding our 7 year old's hand after she lost her balance the first 5 minutes. He never let her go after that. He was incredibly knowledgeable and patient with everyone, especially the children in the group. The hour and a half went by in the blink of an eye and I was so sad to see it end. You dont realize what the reawakening of many of your senses - in particular smell and sound - when you emerge from the cave but he told us to pay particular attention when we exited and it was so amazing to realize how QUIET it really was. The mayan ceremony before entering the caves was also very humbling.I would absolutely love to go back - it is challenging as there is uneven terrain, however it is not difficult. My kids did better than I did. I would have taken the walking stick they offered if I had it to do over. And at the end, we were served a very nice luncheon and we got all of the photos that were taken as well as three souvenier shirts (not flimsy t-shirts but nice sun shirts) for $99. Very reasonable considering some other excurisons. Don't miss this excursion - I can promise you it won't disappoint."

            "review": "A wonderfully unique cave experience. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed Rio Secreto. When they say that the only stuff you need to bring with you is a swimsuit, they're not kidding-- they provide you with a wetsuit, watershoes, life jacket, and hard hat w/ light. They also provide lockers to put your other stuff away in. Some of our companions didn't bring any money with them, which wasn't even a problem when it came time to buy pictures at the end of the excursion-- they were given internet information to view and purchase their pictures from the comfort of home instead.The tour started with a brief orientation, followed by a very bumpy ride in an air-conditioned van through the woods (maybe 15 minutes) to \"base\", followed by a mandatory shower (to wash off makeup, perfumes, and other artificial substances) and changing into the provided gear. Then came a bit of an ersatz nature walk (roughly 10 minutes)-- our guide was showing how informative he could be already with his patter as we walked, and kept getting better throughout the trip.There was a short (kinda hokey) interlude with a \"native\" Mayan that blessed our little group of 6 (plus the guide and a photographer, so 8 total), and then we entered the cave by going down a set of stairs maybe 30 feet.Right away, the air got comfortably cooler (a good thing, given the somewhat stifling effect of the gear being worn), and somehow cleaner smelling. As we walked through the caves, there were occasional stops for pictures, along with delays as the group navigated some difficult stretches of terrain. Despite the unsteady footing, my wife and I never felt uncomfortable or closed-in, which is saying something when it comes to caving! However, that same unsteady footing did cause most of our group to suffer minor bumps and scratches, which we were warned ahead of time to expect.After a bit of walking (maybe 30 minutes), we came to a section of wonderfully cool water where we floated (I wouldn't really call it swimming, since it was so leisurely and the lifejackets were so buoyant) for another 15 minutes or so, before finishing up with another 15 minutes or so of walking. According to our guide, we got roughly 90' belowground at our deepest.By and large, the water was beautiful and clear, and the caverns we entered were soaring. Though we spotted bats at a couple of points, there was no evidence of poop or ammonia smell due to the circulation in the caves. At one point, near the deepest part, our guide showed us a deep cleft in the \"floor\" of the caves, roughly 30' across and 250' deep-- very impressive to see that far down since the cleft was full of crystal-clear water! He explained that the water was from another level beneath ours that was mostly submerged-- a separate underground river, if you will.After getting back to base, we changed back to our own clothes and had a buffet lunch-- the food was so-so, but the salsa dips were good and spicy-hot. Then, after the teeth-rattling return trip via van, we were headed \"home\".Overall, having done a number of other caving trips in the U.S., this one ranks as the best I've been on, both from the standpoint of the cleanliness/natural state of the caves and the water experience. Our guide was also wonderful. At some points underground, the scenery was even somewhat romantic!"

            "review": "The BEST decision we ever made! not for older folks!. My boyfriend and I decided to share the responsibilities of picking shore excursions when we sailed on the carnival Dream. When he told me he signed us up for the Rio Secreto, I have to admit I hesitated. Our tour guide \"Angel\" greeted us on the pier and he was the one who took us through our experience of the secret river/ caves. I thought I was going to be chased down by bats and bat pooo but theres no words to express the wonderful experience that I had on the tour. I'll try by telling you that all you need for the day is a bathing suit and possible dry clothes for the return trip. They provide water shoes, wet suits, hard hats with lights, and even food for afterwards. Angel was very caring and passionate when it comes to the history of the caves, and for all that are on his tour, so I highly recommend requesting Angel for the tour guide. He showed us through the most wonderful cave, and what really made this a wonderful experience is the water in the cave. There is not bats and no snakes etc. in the water and how you can tell....... the water is so clean, you can see straight through to the very bottom. At no point in the tour did we go under water but we did get a chance to float (with life jackets) through to the other side (which wasn't too far). They don't allow pictures but a nice lady followed us and took pictures of each person or each group. (pictures do cost a little money at the end of the tour). The cavern was hard to walk through due to the fact its a cave and not a straightened paved man made path etc. But as long as you don't have problems with your bones or joints, you should have a great time. Not for people who want fabulous lights and glamor but this trip is for people who want to see a SECRET river (not open to the public) and see that nature can be a beautiful thing. ** cave lovers!**"

            "review": "A different kind of experience, though not your usual \"cruise excursion\". We decided last minute to purchase the Secret River or \"Rio Secreto\" excursion as part of our Princess cruise. I have to admit I was a bit anxious as Princess rated the excursion as \"strenuous\" with some swimming required, but figured things would be fine since there weren't any age or weight restrictions. Our family, which includes a teenage son and two younger boys as well as my seventy year old mom were not sure what to expect. We took a ferry from Cozumel to Playa del Carmen which was roughly 45 minutes. I almost canceled the excursion once we arrived at Playa del Carmen because the guide, Mena, required that we sign a number of indeminification forms, which basically stated that the Company was not at fault if anything happened to us during the tour---otherwise, we had the option to cancel our excursion. I was pretty turned off with having to sign these forms, primarily because it was a last minute deal where you signed your life away. I decided to sign anyways, because I felt safe enough that if it was good enough for Princess to be affiliated with, it was good enough for us. We were then divided into groups of ten and shuttled into nice, clean and fairly new air-conditioned vans for about 30-40 minutes. The ride was horrible because of the slow, bumpy, pot-hole ridden gravel roads where Rio Secreto is situated. We were greeted by our river guide, Joan, although he pronounced it more like \"Joe-Ahn\" who was great. He was very knowledgable and considerate and so much better to interact with than Mena. The bathrooms were pretty clean, although the outdoor \"showers' reminded me of what you'd find at Disneyland's Swiss Family Robinson treehouse . In addition to lockers, they provided a wetsuit, water shoes, and a life vest. I would recommend you bring your water shoes and aqua socks that are a snug fit as you do not want rocks entering through loose soles that can cause blisters. Also, be prepared for the \"smell\" when you put on their wet suits. Most of the tour of the cave and underground river is spent walking. There is some wading, and a few pockets where your can swim or dog paddle. Joan took excellent care of my mom since she doesn't swim and he basically towed her in the few deep areas. I towed my youngest son even though he knows how to swim, because he was intimidated being in the cave.Take advantage of the walking stick they provide, because it actually helps to provide balance. You can't grab on most areas of the cave as it is fragile.The ground floor of the cave can be slippery and the walk through the river can be difficult because there are sharp and jagged rocks that are not visible. Got some bumps and scrapes on my shin and legs, but nothing serious. The overall experience was amazing, because it's simply not something folks do on a typical vacation. I would have rated it excellent but had to factor the annoyances I mentioned above. While you have to endure smelly wetsuits, a bumpy ride, I'm glad our family went on this \"adventure\". It's a great feeling to be in an unusual and \"haunting\" envirnment and have the opportunity to see a bat, stalactites and stalagmites and a river created from rainfall. I've been to Carlsbad Caverns, which is beautiful and \"sparkly\", but not at all the same kind of \"rugged\" experience. Being well rested and fed before the excursion sure helped because it is long and tiring. The \"buffet\" lunch of taquitos, black beans, and other snacks are bleh. Kids did not want to eat the food. I didn't care for the last leg of the excursion where our tour guide dropped us off at the shopping area for an hour. I just wanted to go back to the ship and relax. You can't bring ANY cameras inside the cave, so you'd have to purchase photos through Rio Secreto for mementos. Frankly, I was surprised there were no \"hard sell\" tactics and wish we had more money on hand to tip Joan for this worthwhile experience."

Our bank at Schools First Credit Union waited 90 days to recieve our reimbursement form Bancomer, yet not even a dime was sent to us. Rio Secreto needs to hire a different bank to reimburse transactions. Our bank was kind enough and loyal to reimburse us the money. After not seeing any results or hope that our money would be returned by you guys, our bank really stepped forward.... otherwise, I would have still been making phone calls/emails to Rio Secreto admin and gotten NOWHERE!!!! Please use my experience as a fault on your business end (wether its banking or poor follow ups to customers on behalf of administration staff). Obviously I am still not happy with the fact that your business claimed a false statement saying \"you guys paid us back\". I mean that was a lot of money. It is so easy to charge a credit card when on vacation, but never would have I expected going thru this ordeal of having to go back and forth CONSTANT, I mean CONSTANT times in order to get reimbursed.

The operator is very organized and meets you at the dock. From there you go by 10 passenger van to the Rio Secreto. There is about a 10-15min ride just before you get to the site, and it is a very bumpy pothole filled coral rock bed...but it is worth the ride in and seems much shorter out. At the Rio Secreto we were met by Franchesca, who was absolutely terrific! She was so enthusiastic and knowledgeable regarding the underground river, its initial finding in 2006 and what we saw and did in the approximately 90 minutes in the caverns. My wife was the only one to accept a walking stick, and we would recommend anyone to have one as the footing in the caverns is difficult at times and the stick really aids in balance. The wetsuits work well along with the helmet lights. Not only is there walking at different depths, but definite swimming required--but not difficult. The boys really enjoyed the adventure from the initial Mayan blessing to the accension up the original Mayan stairs to the surface and then a traditional lunch. Along the way they take many photos and we ordered the whole boat which includes the CD of our specific group and then three other items-we chose 2 really nice teeshirts for the boys and a bottle of Mexican liquor(honey and licorice tasting). All was really great until we got home and the CD only partially worked. I immediately called their customer service and they were TERRIFIC and they put me in touch with the photo company and their customer service, and they then sent by email for me to download the entire CD with all the pictures. They all downloaded easily and we have the whole experience to relive again and again. We loved it and would definitely recommend it."

We had a couple of people in our group that weren't certified divers, so I decided to book this unique adventure. I have been to Xcaret and was not impressed, too crowded. I am so glad that I chose this excursion. This unspoiled natural reserve is just amazing. Our guide Eva kept us safe and on the right path. She explained how the cave was discovered and how much had been mapped so far. How formations were made. And what was planned next for exploring the rest of these caves. I love that there has been such great care in keeping this jewel well preserved. The small groups make the trip very personal. We had teens and adults in our group and all seemed entertained. I also saw groups with even younger children that seemed to thrive on this truly unique adventure. It is a must see. Afterwards they served us a buffet lunch that was so yummy, even the green salsa from \"Hell\". If I ended up in Playa del Carmen again with non-divers, I will visit this place again and ask for a different route. There are 3 available. BEAUTIFUL!!! Purchase the pictures it is worth it."

You must make a reservation b/c the numbers per tour and tours per day are limited. They start you off w/a short video as you sit outside in a covered area. Then your tour guide meets you and gets you set up with the wetsuits, helmets w/lights, watershoes, etc.What I didn't see mention of is that you then have to take a van ride over an unpaved road to the cave entrance...it was extremely bumpy and fast and felt like about 15 minutes long. We happened to be in the back of the van and I was feeling sick to my stomach at the end (and I never get car sick!), so if this is an issue for you be sure to sit in the front of the van. The cave is peaceful and beautiful and our guide Alfredo was truly passionate about his job. You have about 90 mins in the cave which feels like the right amount of time. We were not cold at all but opted to wear the wetsuits for protection from sharp rocks you inevitably rub up against. It was difficult at times to navigate through w/my two kids by myself (husband was sick) but thankfully another mom helped me with my older child. The walking is difficult at times b/c you can't always see where you are stepping b/c the mineral rich water is cloudy. If you are not that sure on your feet then this is not the trip for you.Afterward they walk you into the picture area where your photographer has put all the photos he took on the adventure, and this is why I can't give Rio Secreto 5 stars. I would not call it a \"hard sell\" but we bought a photo which they supposedly put on a CD. When we got home and I tried to print it, it was blank. You would think a simple email or phone call would remedy this but it took no less than three emails and FOUR phone calls to get my picture, some of which were not free b/c they told me I had to call the non-800 number, essentially long distance from the US to Mexico. This was extremely frustrating and spread out over a few weeks' time. In the end, I did get my pictures, and other pictures taken of us (which I asked for), but I would recommend VERIFYING that your picture is actually on the CD before you leave so you don't have to jump through hoops later."

Our guide Julian was absolutely brilliant, his enthusiasm and pride in this underground river and caverns was very catching. Some people may read about this trip and worry about safety and fitness required to do it. I can assure you that if we can do it, so can you. The guides take small groups at a time, well spaced out, we never saw another group at all. All necessary equipment is provided by the attraction, every bit as good as what their site says it is. Adventurous children with no fears of the dark or caves would enjoy this tour, although I would suggest at least 10 years old.The road in, is a dirt track, but accept this as part of the trip - bumpy fun! The food afterwards left a lot to be desired, but this is a minor point and certainly should not be allowed to cloud your judgement."

They do supply them but they are in rough shape! They will offer you a walking stick if you want and I suggest you take it!It is an amazing cave but it's very hard to get your footing. You are walking behind a group of people and the water gets really cloudy. It's comparable to walking on an iron shore (very rough & sharp porous sections of rock similar in look to a sponge, but very sharp) but under murky water. You can't grab on to anything if you lose your balance. The guide wears a full wet suit and large rubber water boots to protect the ankles and knees. It would have been better to have full protection as well. It is very easy to get your ankles and knees scraped up.We found it to be very interesting. I only wished that the groups were divided by language. Our guide had to repeat herself in English and French. I was lucky, I understand both languages but others did not and you could see they were getting bored. When we booked this excursion, we were told to bring some money for souvenirs. They should mention that you should bring lots of money. All the way through the cave, we had a photographer, he took many pictures and family pictures. When the tour was over, we were escorted over to a building and all handed iPads. We looked at our pictures and they were wonderful except for the price. 100 dollars for all the pictures, two t-shirts, and two hats, there may have been something else thrown in but I was shocked at the price. We already paid 200 dollars! You think a picture would have been included! The next price down was 70 dollars for the pictures only or 25 dollars for each picture! That's highway robbery as far as I'm concerned! The food at the end was OK but like another reviewer said, it was probably sitting around for a while.

Amazing underground river/cave experience in such a raw and natural state. We took our 72 year old, healthy, fit parents who also very much enjoyed the tour. Our guide, Luis was excellent and truly took care of our mother who at first was somewhat hesitant.All gear is provided, if your shoes have a hole in them, ask for another pair. We did not take walking sticks but probably would have to assist with the more underwater, uneven portions of the walk.(My parents took the sticks and utilized them).The walk to the caves was not difficult and we had expected more \"swimming\" thru the caves on the river but there was more walking thru knee high water that floating. If you are not a swimmer I believe this would not be an issue because of the life jackets for floating and your partner or the guide may assist you by gently pulling on you.The Rio Secreto website is very informative and the \"Live Chat\" option answered any questions prior to our arrival.We had researched out the prices before had and recieved a great price, $52 (spring break deal) for admission only, 2:00pm tour. Currently for the rest of March/April 2013 it is $56 for the 2pm tour, admission only.The included meal at the end was \"OK\" but we were at the end of the day and not overly hungry.FYI.....Now for the reason of only a 4*.....from the ticket booth/entrance of Rio Secreto (however you get there), you will begin the tour by getting on a 10 person van to travel the 8km \"gravel\" road.....which is terrible.....full of washboards and holes the entire 8kms......the guide said it's not paved due to not ruining the caves etc.......I understand that but a grater with some gravel would do the trick......I actually think it was limestone road which was packed to be super hard.This 8kms took at least 20 minutes to drive at a very slow speed depending on your driver....Sitting towards the front of the van does help with car sickness.Even with that being said the actual cave is still worth seeing and maybe one day they will get the road in better shape."

There were 30 people from Oasis of the Seas that morning and I thought the staff did an amazing job from the minute we were met on the pier. The staff on Oasis wasn\u2019t as informative as we would have liked but once we got off the ship and walked down the pier we saw the Rio Sectreto sign and from that point on we were very well taken care of. We had to take a very tipsy ferry from Cozumel to Playa de Carmen - not the best part of the experience but it was brief (30 minutes). From there they broke us into three groups and took us to the cave in three vans on a BUMPY dirt road. We were fortunate enough to be in a group that had some returning guests and they had requested Alfredo. What a great tour guide! So passionate about his job and for the love of the cave - very contagious! Not only was he very knowledgeable he was GREAT with our 9 year old son. I wasn\u2019t sure how my son would do in a dark cave but after having done it I know he will be back and will explore many more caves. Alfredo took my son\u2019s hand and led him through the cave and was also able to make sure that the other 9 guests were taken care of. It\u2019s hard to put into words just how incredible this experience is\u2026.my recommendation is if you are anywhere nearby \u2013 make sure you go. I thought that the facilities that they have built out in the midst of the jungle were great. The equipment (wet suits, helmets, lights, life vests) that they gave us were also in excellent condition. After exiting the cave and getting changed we sat down to an authentic (I guess) Mexican lunch. I read a few reviews that people didn\u2019t like the food but all 10 of us thought the food was excellent. The tortilla soup in particular was delicious. The staff was also very concerned about getting us back to the ferry and onto our ship on time. Angel (Rio Sectreto staff) stayed with us until he saw and confirmed that all of us made it onto the ferry. We were very pleased and amazed by the entire excursion. If you go\u2026 ask for Alfredo...you won\u2019t be disappointed."

Lunch afterwards was fine. No personal cameras are allowed and the tour photographer\u2019s picture package \u2013 albeit good \u2013 is expensive at $69.00. You are escorted back to Playa Del Carmen for some shopping time then escorted to the ferry for your return to the ship."

The hike was moderately physical but our guides, Alfredo and Hector were there to help out every step of the way. The caverns were unbelievably beautiful and the swim in an underground lake was truly spectacular.Our guides were extremely knowledgeable and attentive and really made it an amazing experience for the whole family."

My wife's knee has been messed up for quite a while now, and i was hesitant to take her because i didn't know if she would be able to through. But once we got there our guide Ava made all our worries disappear. She helped my wife every step of the way telling her about every rock and ledge there was, she was fantastic! One of the best guides we have ever had! The cave also was spectacular! We have been to many other caves (in fact our honeymoon was at mammoth cave, Kentucky) but Rio Secreto was our favorite! So many formations to see, literally everywhere! Then throw in being able to put on a wetsuit and float through a cave, it was breath taking to say the least! I only hope that the land owner continues to allow them to provide tours of the cave, and keeps it natural. The only thing we were slightly put off by was the fact they you can't take a camera down with you, even if it was waterproof. But once we got in, we understood why, unless you wanted to risk taking a expensive camera and flash down with u, it would be worthless, plus it would be way to easy to get it wet and ruin it! The photographer that took pictures of our group did a great job, and i didn't mind spending the extra money to buy the disc of pics. Also the Mayan booze at the end of the your was a nice touch :) all in all, if you like caves or places not so packed with tourist you can't walk, go here, you WON'T regret it!"

We booked it thinking it was like the lazy river, float through a cave thing but it became quickly apparent it was much more of an active caving tour in a cave where we get to go swimming. I was thrilled but some of my party were claustrophobic and were only pretending to be okay for my sake! We ALL loved it and talked about it all week! Our guide, Pablo, was wonderful and passionate. You could see how inspired he was by the cave and how much he loved his job. It was contagious and our group all bonded and spent the rest of the week hanging out with each other. We all did different tours and this one was not too long, but not so short you felt you weren't getting your money's worth.Because there were four of us who went together we bought the CD with the photos on it. It is a little pricey but we divided it between our group and it was okay. If there had been two of us I'm not sure I would have bought it.This was truly beautiful and I would happily do this again!The only \"con\" (in quotes because it really barely counts as a con) was the lunch was just mediocre. But you don't go on this sort of thing for the food. VERY happy I got this chance to do the Rio Secreto!"

            "review": "Admirable Stewardship of a Beautiful Resource. This was an amazing experience. We descended into a breathtaking series of underground caverns and viewed remarkable ancient rock formations. I understand this is a fairly recent discovery (2007, according to our guide.) The cave itself is hidden fairly deeply into the Yucatan jungle. Despite the fact that this was only a half-day excursion, it was very involved. The trek from the highway into the jungle site of the cave complex entrance is 20 minutes or so on a fairly rough road. Upon your arrival you are fitted with wetsuit, life jacket, water shoes, helmet and light. Trekking in the cave is lightly physically challenging and the wetsuit does add some degrees of temperature during the dry portions of the trek. The underground journey lasts about 1 hour 20 mins. The last portion is a swim through some of the deeper waters. Our guide, Paco, was knowledgeable and helpful. A great experience; and great to see Mexico's natural wonders being protected through tourism rather than bulldozed.Quick proviso: This excursion is physically challenging, the footing in the cave is uneven, there are small passageways that necessitate bending and fancy footwork. I found myself pretty tired by the end of the tour - I am in my early thirties, but not in fantastic condition, if I'm honest."

Our family, ages 46 through age 10 loved the visit from start to finish. The cave system is traversed by a combination of walking, and \"swimming\"-really more like floating in relatively shallow waters. The highlight is swimming (with flotation device on) in shallow water surrounded by stalactites/stalagmites creating a cathedral like effect. Hopefully the tourist industry in Mexico continues to add more natural sites that are as well done as this one-professional and intelligent guides, clean facilities on par with the best similar US facilities and great hospitality. If you want more from your vacation than the classic tourist experience, this is it. Also recommend visiting the Dos Ojos cenote system that is a completely different, but awesome experience combined with snorkeling or diving, depending on preference. The Rio Secreto guide Antonio also deserves a shout out for his knowledge of the cave system, excellent language skills...and, how many times do you get a guide who is an accomplished jazz guitarist who can discuss the finer points of guitar and amp construction? Save room for the free Mayan buffet (excellent quality) afterwards. And yes, you will likely want to pay for the professional photos of you and yours(they are optional) that you will want to help you remember what you did when you were younger and vibrant!"

Our family of 4 (2 adults, 11 yr old boy and 8 yr old girl) took this adventure on 2 separate days with 2 different guides and everyone reported back that it \"was awesome\". I wasn't sure what our kids would think of heading into a cave, but our guides were very knowledgeable and made sure we all had a good time. The kids loved learning about the Mayan culture, the formations, the ecosystem, and eating the Mayan food (Yum!) It is a truly incredible experience! I'd highly recommend putting on your \"Bucket List\" and we'd definitely go back (they have several areas you can explore, so you can let them know which one you've been in before).It's a great thing to schedule when you either want a break from the heat or the rain. It can get a bit cold, but it's an easy fix with an extra layer - my tiny 8 yr old was fine with a long sleeve rash guard under the wet suit. I did see another reviewer question the eco-consciousness of such an excursion - referring to the merits of allowing many people into a place where the ecosystem is so delicate and must be protected (they require you not wear any lotions/sunscreen/bug spray/jewelry and ask that you do not touch anything). Clearly we need to make efforts to preserve and protect and, admittedly, I thought about the same question. But when you think about it, it is also imperative to educate people and allowing an \"experience\" is often much more powerful than simply reading about it. I liken it to the many mountain trails and national parks we have in the U.S. Providing places for people to explore and experience the outdoors does make an impact on the environment, but it is evident it is an effective way to inform, educate and hopefully inspire people to help preserve these precious areas. Sure, there is a price: that we provide (\"sacrifice\") areas/trails where people can go, but the hope is that the benefits outweigh the cost.We had the privilege of meeting one of the owners of Rio Secreto and it was very clear they are passionate about conservation and sustainability. Not only is it affiliated with a non-profit conservation effort, but Rio Secreto has the unique ability to promote conservation and study human impact in a very controlled environment. So, yes there is an impact, but it is intended for the greater good and to have an overall positive effect on the local and broader community, attitude and economy. We and our children left truly impressed by the entire meaningful and memorable experience."

We were glad to see this cavern in such a raw, pristine, natural state! But, we can not recommend it to anyone that has issues with walking on uneven surfaces (or unseen surfaces!).

He was very knowledgeable about the caves and took time to answer our questions and point out highlights along the way. The other best part of the trip was the small group that we traveled with. We were concerned about going on an excursion with large groups and opted for Rio Secreto because tours were limited to 10 people. It was fun walking and swimming through the cave - something we will never forget. As expected, no cameras were allowed in. Be prepared to spend anywhere from $25 (one photo) to $99 (package of photos and souvenirs) if you want to have evidence of your trip there. They were not pushy at all to buy anything which was refreshing."

While there are lots of cenotes (underground caves) in Yucatan, this is a special one because the tour company works hard to keep their designation as a 100% nature preserve and one of Mexico's leading green expedition companies. We were divided into groups by language, assigned an english-speaking guide who outfitted each of us with a wet suit, life vest, water shoes, hard hat with light and a walking stick. He then led our group of about 10 down into the cave. As we ventured further, we had to be careful to pick our way carefully around stalagmites rising up from the floor and stalagtites hanging from the roof. We were taught to be careful so to not touch them as they are fragile. The walking stick was a great help. At times we were walking on the dry floor of the cave while other times we walked in clear water and towards the end of the 90 minute tour, we had to swim as the water was too deep to walk in. The water temperature was not uncomfortable and our life vests made movement through the water easy. Our guide was fluent in english and very knowledgeable in the geography and geology of the cenote. In all, it was a very unique and enjoyable experience. When we emerged, we were provided with a lunch buffet. While not a highlight of the visit, there was a variety and plenty of food."

When we left our ship, a staff member took our excursion tickets, placed wrist bands on us and ushered us onto a ferry to Playa Del Carmen. Use the rest room on the ferry because there's not another chance before you get to the actual site. When we left the ferry, another staff member walked us to a plaza where she explained the tour and gave us forms to complete. We were divided into groups of 7 to 10 people in each. We then boarded vans and drove to the site. It was a bumpy road through very scraggly jungle, but the driver tried to be gentle. We were given water shoes (you can also bring your own) and lockers and then walked a short distance and received short wet suits, helmets with headlamps and life jackets (they protect from sharp rocks and also provide bouancy). We then walked through the jungle a short distance, received a blessing and then walked into the cave accompanied by our photographer (who stayed totally in the background and was not intrusive at all). . The cave was not colorful--mostly white due to its being composed primarily of calcium) but beautifu and eerie with the soft glow of the headlamps and the reflections of the water. Our guide, Mario, was very informative and helpful and took the time to answer our questions. Occassionally we would encounter another tour group, but only for a few minutes. There was not a lot of climbing but you did need to watch or rather feel your step. When you looked into the water, it seemed you could see where you were going or what you were talking on, but the water made it deceptive. At times we were in water inches deep and other times swimming through water. The water was surprisingly comfortable. My husband can be claustrophobic but had no problems--i believe because you are so involved with what you are seeing and being careful in moving (you don't want to hit the rocks because you don't want to damage them plus they are very sharp) you don't have time to be concerned about being in a tight spaces. The most difficult part was at the end when we had to duck-walk about four steps through a short space. Once exiting the cave, we removed our wet suits and had a buffet lunch (salad, tamales, beans, rice, potatoes, meat sauce, fruit)--we enjoyed it very much. Also had a chance to select photos. We chose to purchase the CD of all our photos for $69. Following that we rode the van back to town, had an hour to shop and then took the ferry back to our cruise ship. We really, really enjoyed this tour and would highly recommend it."

            "review": "Absolutely unique experience, first choice especially on a cloudy day. Rio Secreto (RS) can be described as nature preserve more accurately than as an attraction. It is a huge, majestic and beautiful cave system , but what is unique about it is the way you visit it. I have been to several caves in US, Russia and Bermuda; very interesting but there you basically stroll like in a museum : electric lights, paved paths, \u201cdon\u2019t cross\u201d guardrails. The visit to RS is basically a guided speleological hike : you\u2019ll have to climb, crawl and swim through not yet even completely mapped maze with the help of wet suit, headlamp and a guiding thread. So it gives you not only the incredible beauty (description is impossible) but also a real thrill of adventure and exploration. However there is a small but definite risk of breaking a bone, twisting an ankle, having a panic attack etc, tourists beware. The guides are very knowledgeable and friendly.Some points, tips and advice: - The price , if purchased at your resort, may include a per person transfer fee . If you ask to pay just for tour and no transfer and then just take a taxi to RS you\u2019ll likely save significant time and money. - The tour is not physically exhausting for a healthy person, but probably not for people < 7 or >70\u2019s years old, anyone very overweight, with balance problems, or obviously with fear of darkness, swimming, narrow spaces, bats etc.  - Only things you\u2019ll be allowed, and need, in RS are your swimsuit and eyeglasses (bring eyeglass cord). The rest of your stuff will be locked in a locker, so plan accordingly. - The RS caves have constant temperature regardless of weather, so it makes RS perfect for a cloudy day. But get the tickets early, as everyone will have the same idea. - Photographs and cameras are not allowed in RS (perhaps just as well, otherwise the excited photographers would never leave it). The catch is that a professional photographer will accompany you and at the end of the tour you\u2019ll be offered your ( and cave\u2019s) photos, admittedly of very good quality, on a CD for ~ $70. Of course you\u2019ll buy it. Like it or not, but here it is.  - I am told there are several tour routes at RS, so remember which one you took in a case you want to return again another time and see more."

Even though there were 13 of us on the cruise, I was the only person who opted to go to the cave. That's probably a good thing because it was a bit of a physical experience. The drive from the dock to the Secret River entrance was quite rough - about 20 minutes of very bumpy dirt road. But once you get there, everything else is a delight. You have to strip down to a swim suit, take a quick shower, and change into a wet suit which they provide. They also provide water shoes if you need them (I brought my own). I was also given a locker to store my stuff. All of this was included in the excursion price, so no extra hassles. Our guide was Alfredo and was very helpful and gracious. In fact, everyone on the site seemed very helpful and glad to assist. After some brief instructions, our tour guide and my group of about 8 people walked down a trail to the cave. We stopped for a brief 'prayer' by a Mayan guy. That was kind of strange, but it kind of added to the whole spiritual vibe of the place. Then down into the cave. During my visit, the temperature outside was in the 70's which is the same as the cave. Our guide explained it remains about 74 in the cave at all times. So there wasn't much temperature change for us, but I can imagine on a hot day in the Yucatan it would feel good to step into 74 degrees. The terrain is fairly easy to navigate, but there are plenty of places to stub a toe or perhaps slide on a sloping surface. There's lots of interesting rooms the guide led us through, and plenty of stalagtites and stalagmites to view. The best part, though, is getting to slip into the clear water and swim along through an underground creek. Some of the areas are only knee deep, but in other areas your feet won't touch the bottom. The water was a little chilly at first, but it didn't take long at all to get used to it and just peacefully float along. At one point, everyone turns off all their lights (oh, I forgot to mention the only lighting in the cave is on each person's helmet). The guide asked everyone to stop speaking for about 60 seconds. It was totally dark and completely guide. Very surreal experience. At the end, we exit the cave and change back into our clothes. The guide even gave each of us a shot of tequila. :)I've been in several commercialized caves, and this was definitely was one of the most organized. The staff was friendly and our guide was very passionate and engaged. He seemed to actually enjoy sharing the cave with us and teaching everything he knew. The lockers and change facility were nothing fancy, but clean and had sort of a camp ground feel to it. It was fine with me, but I suppose some more picky people might not like it. Overall, this was worth the time and money. I only give it a 4 out of 5 because of the road getting to the cave was very bumpy. It made me feel slightly car sick by the time we arrived."

Floating, and then getting to experience complete darkness and completely sound free.And as I stated, learning along the way.Our tour guide Eduardo was enthralled with what he was doing, and passed that to the group. Our tour took 1.5 hours, and the comment among the group was it felt like 1/2 hour.Recommend to everyone."

The guides are incredibly knowledgable (Alfredo is awesome and makes an underground dungeon fascinating and fun), the tour feels like your charting unexplored caverns for the first time. Its a great mix of exploration, swimming and tranquility. They even set you up with a local cuisine feast afterward."

            "review": "Definitely an excursion worth taking. If you are staying at a Riviera Maya hotel, or thereabouts, this is definitely an excusion worth taking. It was advertised as a 1/2 day excursion, though it was only a 35 minute ride form the hotel. You are actually underground for a bout 1.5 hours. You are given wet suits and water shoes upon arrival. Before donning the wetsuits, you head for the outdoor shower (let's just say that was not the warmest shower I have ever taken!!). After putting on the wetsuit and water shoes, you are given a hard hat with a headlamp and it is off through the jungle to the entrance to the River. I am glad we did this trip first thing in the a.m.. I can imagine it would get quite warm walking in all that paraphernalia in the hot sun! I am guessing the path was between 0.5 and 1 mile long. Antonio was an informative and helpful guide. They break the tour groups up by language, so you are sure to understand all the information that is being shared. I have to admit, this took a little more energy than I thought it would. Walking sticks are available at the beginning of the tour - I am in my 50's and fit enough, but I think even I could have benefitted from the walking stick at some points, just to get a feel for where things were on the bottom of the river. It wasn't strenuous, but it was challenging in a few spots. But everyone helped each other out, so everything worked out well. The bottom of the river is rocky, with dips and boulders. In most spots you can walk upright, but in a few places you do have to scooch down to get through. You have a life jacket, so in the parts where it is deeper, you can just float along. This was definitely quite the experience. To actually see the minute water drops on the ends of the stalactites and to fully understand what a process goes into the making of this spectacular place makes this excursion a llittel different than some others that involve underground rivers.. You can see the tiniest of crystals and layers of minerals that make up the stalactites. In the final moments, when every turned off their lamps and we were simply floating in the pitch dark, it was the most phenomenal experience - you could hear the tiniest drips and trickles of the water. It certainly gives you a fuller appreciation of the environment that makes up the Yucatan Peninsula. This is an educational but fun excursion - I think it could be enjoyed by folks of all ages. The meal at the end was a bit disappointing - there was a soup and salad, tamales and empanadas. It was all ok, but that is about it."

I cannot put into words how amazed and how beautiful this experience was. Our group of 9 were lead by a very informed tour guide, Mauricio. He took his time to reply to questions that were asked, never rushing. What normally took about 1 hr took us almost 2hrs. It is amazing what you can see below. The water temperature was very nice. Walking around with a wet suit gets quite hot at times so it was nice to be in the water once in a while. At the end you do get to try a typical Mayan meal which was ok. Let's not forget the nice shot of Maya Tequila that was also served upon leaving the Cenote.I would definitely recommend this excursion. It's amazing what this Earth is made of.Myself, I have a bad knee but I was determined to do this. Sore the next day but it was definitely worth it."

We were travelling with another couple and all of us agreed that this was one of the best excursions we've ever been on.The van ride was around 30 minutes from our Gran Bahia Principe resort to the front lobby area near the road. We filled out waiver forms here and watched a short video presentation about the cave system before taking the 20 minute, bumpy ride through the jungle to get to the main area where we geared up.Every couple is given use of locker to safely store any stuff we brought with us which was great and there are big change areas with individual locked stalls to change into and out of bathing suits.Our guide was Antonio, a very friendly and knowledgeable well-spoken young man. I learned a lot about the local underwater river systems and the rock formations inside the caves. He didn't rush us through the 700 metre hike through the river and answered all of questions. I liked that we were a nice small group, there were only 8 of us in total in our English tour. There were 4 others in our van as well but they all went on the French speaking tour in a different part of the river so we didn't see them until the lunch buffet after. Antonio said that there were actually 3 different treks we could take that this company offered. Our favourite part was when we stopped in a large cave and he had all of our group turn off our headlamps and just listen quietly in the dark to the soothing dripping of the water building more stalagtites and stalagmites. It was so peaceful.We were also disappointed that we couldn't take our cameras but were happy to buy the official photographer's pictures despite the costly price. They are no doubt using the funds to preserve this beautiful area for future generations to enjoy. You can buy just one picture for $25 or all of the ones the photographer took of you and your travelling companion specifically plus some extra scenic photos for $69.As other reviewers have mentioned, the buffet lunch after the hike was delicious. They offered free water and lemonade or you could buy pop or beer. Beer was $3 each.This is a fantastic place and I highly recommend trying this experience."

It was amazing seeing the beautiful stalactites and stalagmites that have been forming here for thousands of years. The only negative was our guide, his English was really bad and although he really tried to be helpful he struggled to give us very basic information about the cave.

It is a newer discovery and is not your typical tourist trap cavern trip like many in the US. We had an awesome guide and very informative about so many things we got to see in the cave. We got lucky and saw a couple fruit bats flying around which normally are asleep and are really cool unlike the bats in the US they dont swoop at you and keep their distance and were really cool. We also saw some fish and very small shrimp the guide pointed out or we would have missed them. the water was really nice and was so relaxing in the places you can float the wetsuits and life jackets made it really nice and the light on the helmet made it easy to see anywhere you looked. My only complaint was not being able to take my underwater camera and the pics the photographer took were of people on the tour while we were in the cave. I would much rather have taken some pics of the sights we saw instead. I would suggest they at least allow people to take their own cams and pay a fee to do so. After the tour we were fed a really awesome lunch with authentic cooking that you wont find in a Mexican restaurant. It was all homemade and just awesome. I would recommend this trip if you want to do something that isnt a typical tourist trap."

They provide everything you need to go through the cave; water shoes, wetsuit, and helmet (which is necessary as you will hit your head sooner or later.) The sights were great and it was an interesting experience to be sure. As my wife said, she now appreciates the movies featuring dark caves like Sanctum and The Descent much more after being here. What we didn't like: while the paths you are walking have been used before, I don't understand why we are walking over stalagmite or stalagtites. If there isn't a good path, don't use it. If the goal is to preserve this place for the future, I don't see how people breaking the formations helps by either stepping on them or breaking them off w their helmets. Second, if we are already destroying parts of the system, why not put in a few handrails? That would probably save prevent more damage rather than people having to grab on to the nearest formation in order to prevent them falling. Felt rushed throughout the tour. Little time to enjoy the beauty we are in as the tour kept moving. I wish there was an extended version as this one was too fast. Also, the buffet at the end is nothing to look forward to. I know I didn't list the positives much but that is because I am sure you see the rest of the gushing reviews so I don't need to add to that."

After arriving we watched a short video, then got a wetsuit, water shoes and hardhat with a lamp. A van took our group (limited to no more than 10) about 7km into the jungle on unpaved roads. From there we walked about 10 minutes more to the cave entrance. In the cave a guide pointed out and described geological formations and cultural details, while a photographer took pics. Our guide was very interesting and informative. The trip involved walking through water on uneven footing and some swimming. Walking sticks were available and would be recommended. We were underground for 1-1/2 hours and traveled just over a 1/2 mile. The tour itself was a good value, although the picture/souvenir packages were quite limited and a bit pricey."

You are assigned a locker and change into your bathing suit. They supply beach shoes, wetsuit, life jacket and helmet with light. After a Mayan blessing, you follow your guide and enter the cave, at times, wading throogh water, climbing a bit (the grouind is uneven at times) or swimming. The water was very clear (you could see small catfish) and cool, but not overly so. There were bats sleeping in the ceiling of the cave amongst stalactites and stalagmites. There was another guide who took pictures which you could purchase at the tour's end.At the end of the tour and after changing, we enjoyed our Mayan lunch. We really enjoyed this tour.

I booked the tickets directly through their official website without any issues (Violeta was very helpful with all my questions!) and even received free pickup because we took part in a promotion they were offering. The location was about 10 min away from our resort, Reef Playacar. Once there, there's another 10-15 min drive on a VERY rocky jungle road to get to the start point for the excursion. Lemme tell you, this cave is a wonder of nature and I wouldn't hesitate to say it's one of the most beautiful sites I have EVER visited in my life. It's very dark and you have to go in and out of water inside the cave (be wary of rock formations inside the water, which the guide warns you about all along the way), so it isn't recommended for claustrophobic people, pregnant women, and I would also say young children. Our guide, Fransesca was so knowledgeable about the cave and every formation in there, it was great to here her talk about it. The cave is a completly surreal experience which I cannot recommend enough to anyone going to Riviera Maya. You cannot take pictures inside the cave, but you have a professional photgraph following you all along the way to take way better pictures than any of us could have taken anyhow. They sell you the CD of pictures at the end if you wish, its a bit expensive but completly worth it for a souvenir of this once-in-a-lifetime experience. There is also a nice outdoor meal offered at the end of the excursion (mini-buffet), the food was very good. All in all, we must have spent about 3 hours there in total, perfect for a mid-day excursions. Do NOT miss this place!!!"

In the end, we both loved the tour.Keep in mind there are multiple routes a tour group can take in the cave, which may explain why the reviews differ. Our group went on the Allegria path - which, about halfway through, was nearly constant swimming or at least water up to our waist. Our tour guide, Paco, was very patient and concerned about each of the people in the tour - one woman was terrified, and Paco guided her next to him the whole time, and allowed her to hold on to his shoulders during the swimming portion. This isn't the place for someone who has trouble walking, that's for sure. The footing can be slippery, some of the corners and areas are difficult to maneuver. You can't touch the walls or hold on to anything (above water), because the oils of the skin will destroy the stalactite and stalagmite formations, so group members are encouraged to help each other out - giving a hand when stepping up or down, giving warnings of tricky areas and how to get through them. They do offer walking sticks as well, to help out.Yes, you definitely spend a lot of time looking down (to be careful). But you're not so rushed through the cave that you can't pause and look around you, too, to enjoy the amazing cave. The water on our path was not murky at all - beautiful turquoise color, when the light hit it. Not as cold as I was expecting either (the caves themselves were quite warm, and wetsuits are provided, along with water shoes). They also provide a buffet meal at the end. The only downside, to me, was the lack of options and price for the photo packages at the end. $25 for one photo, $69 for all, and $99 for a pack that included a few souvenirs in addition to the photos. Because you aren't allowed any cameras in the cave, if you want a memento you're forced to pay the price. I felt the tour was reasonably priced though, and since the photos were very well done, I \"caved\" and purchased."

They give you the line that it goes towards conservation. Food was not great. We were the last tour of the day so it was probably sitting out for a while. They abandoned us in the parking lot at the end of the day. We asked where we could get a taxi but got a shoulder shrug as they all scurried away like cockroaches.

We were divided into small groups and assigned guides. There were seven in our group, plus the guide. We were issued all necessary equipment for the tour, and lockers for our personal belongings. From the time that we met our guide, Rodrigo, he began to explain the many different levels of significance these caves have. Before we entered the caves, we joined in a short prayer and blessing. We were thoroughly impressed with not only Rodrigo's knowledge, but his passion for this river. There are no words to accurately describe the magnificence of this experience. From the pristine water to the beautiful formations, to the all of the inhabitants of the area, the impact is absolutely dumbfounding. The experience includes walking a short path through a wooded area, up and down some steep stairs, over some very uneven terrain that may or may not be under water. Sometimes you might be wading in water at heights from your ankles to your waist, and sometimes you may be swimming. (Swimming is not the proper description. You are floating and paddling with your arms.) A home made lunch was provided for us after the tour, which was absolutely delicious. The staff took some pictures of our group, which were then put on a CD that included pictures of some of the things that live in and around the area. Their souvenir packages were a good value, and if you buy the photos, the money goes into preserving the cavern (including the portion that is off limits). The advertisements and recommendations suggest that physical limitations might prevent you from being able to participate in this tour. I would take them into consideration before booking, but if you are an active person, you should have no problems. Our group included a plus-sized woman (230 pounds & 5'4\"), a single middle aged man, and 60 year old woman with an obvious neck or back problem Everyone in our group was able to master the challenges. Everyone in your group will need a hand at different times, and part of the fun is working together. Our guide told us that he has taken people as old as 89 years of age, and we saw families with young children (they looked to be around 5 or 7 years of age). The bottom of the cavern is not slippery, as there is no algae. Without headlights (which are provided) the cavern is in COMPLETE darkness. To quote our guide \"walk with confidence\".We found this tour as an excursion on a cruise. After the tour, we had almost an hour until the ferry back to Cozumel, and as soon as we walked up the gangway, the ship pushed off from the dock, so this excursion takes the entire day. Also, Rio Secreto provides towels for you, so you don't need to bring the ship's towels, unless you would like to swim on the beach during that last hour before you catch the ferry."

We saw some cool creatures that live their entire lives under ground. Many were albino!Raul truely loved his job and expressed that with great enthusiasm. It was a treat to be in his group.The only part I did not like was the hard sell on the photos they took of you in the caves. Great pics, poor hard sell. The meal we enjoyed at the end was also great. Loved the lime soup.An experience I will never forget."

Then we took a 7km bus ride (VERY BUMPY--not a paved road) closer to the opening of the cave. We were assigned lockers to secure our valuables. They do not allow anything except your swimsuit and glasses (if necessary) to ensure that nothing is lost in the cave. I was concerned about photographs, but there is a photographer who accompanies you on the trip. You rinse off in showers to wash all chemicals off your body as this may harm the cave's formations. Then you suit up: wet suit, life jacket, water shoes and a helmet equipped with a light. You take a quick 5 minute walk to the cave entrance. Our tour guide Francesca was very knowledgeable and took time with all individuals on the tour. She was fluent in english and all of the details about the history of the cave and the scientific names of the formations. I liked that we had a small group -- only 8 people so we got to ask many questions, etc. The tour was AWESOME.... very neat inside, dark and quiet, like a whole new world. There were parts where you walk and others where you swim/float through. After the trip through the cave, we had a traditional mexican lunch. The food was very good and included lime soup, empanadas, rice and salad.The only negative was the photos. You could not bring your own camera and they charged $25 for just ONE photo! There were a few packages you could purchase as well but they ranged between $70 to $100. I did not bring enough money and was disappointed the price was so high."

Our group was a mixture of people ranging from early 30's to late 50's and no one had difficulty with any of the tour. Some of us were tall and some shorter. This tour is for anyone of all sizes. The guides are well trained. We donned water shoes, wet suites and a miners helmet equipped with a light. Length of tour underground was well over an hour. The stalactites and stalagmites were beautiful to see with one's own eyes. The colours were spectacular. Saw some bats, catfish, and a blind spider. If you'd like to see this, you won't be disappointed!"

The caves themselves were spectacular and not too difficult to maneuver, even with children. The area of the cave we were in was so large, there was never a feeling of being in an enclosed space. The portion of the cave that we swam/floated at the end was amazing. You cannot bring a camera as you spend your time watching your footing but they have a photographer follow your group and take pictures throughout. The pictures came out amazing and the CD was reasonably priced.The 90 minutes we spent underground at Rio Secreto were a once in a lifetime experience that we would urge anyone traveling in this part of Mexico, not to miss out on!"

I was very nervous about being able to keep up with the group, as I have a previous spinal fracture and nerve damage in one of my legs. But I REALLY wanted to do this, even if it made me limp the next day. I need not have worried. Our guide, Alanis, put me in the front of the group so I could set the pace. The lady right behind me had bad knees, and she was grateful not to be the most disabled person in the group! The walking sticks that they offered at the beginning of the tour were EXTREMELY helpful, as was our sweet guide. He took my hand at every difficult place and guided me through. It was a wonderful experience. The caves are beautiful. The water was cool and refreshing and gave me a chance to float for a while instead of having to walk the whole way. The lunch at the end was an EXCELLENT buffet. Buy the picture CD! Yes, it's a little expensive- but the shots were great and very personal. How can you resist? Are you ever going to come back? Probably not. So, you must have the pictures! And the money goes to support this important place on Earth that they are preserving. Oh! One more thing, English is spoken by almost everyone there.

It was about a 40 minute ride from Playa del Carmen to their facility (20 on the roads and 20 on a dirt road through the jungle). Once we arrived, we were given lockers to store our stuff and then outfitted with a wetsuit, helmet and water shoes. The walking stick is optional but a few of us took it and it came in handy. We were in the caves for about 90 minutes. There were other groups going into the caves at the same time but there are different routes so we never saw or heard anyone else. Once we exited the caves, we turned in our gear, changed, and ate lunch, which left a little to be desired but the lunch wasn\u2019t why we signed up for the excursion so no big deal.By the way, there is a point while in the caves where you will turn off all lights and be absolutely quiet\u2026 what a neat experience!!"

Being claustrophobic, it was a little outside my comfort zone, but I am SO glad I did it. Ferry ride was approximately 30-45 minutes, then a short but VERY bumpy ride to the Rio Secreto. With swimsuits on, we were asked to shower under outside showers to wash away any lotions or body oils -- COLD!!! Then we donned wetsuits and helmets with lights. TIP: They offer you a walking stick -- take it!! Makes keeping your balance on the uneven ground and in the water MUCH easier. Then there was a short Mayan \"cleansing ceremony\" and we entered the caves. It was so totally incredible that any fears I had about feeling claustrophobic immediately evaporated. Our guide was amazing and helped us to fully appreciate how incredible this natural phenomenon truly is. Water is chilly, but not really cold, and is incredibly crystal clear. Part of the time is on dry ground, part is in shallow water and a couple of times in deeper. No need to be a good swimmer. If you can dog paddle, you'll be fine. There were some tight places and some climbing was involved, but if you're in reasonably good physical shape, again, you should be fine. When the guide asked us to turn out our lights, it was truly an incredible experience -- almost spiritual -- so much so that one of the members of our party asked that we do it again. Another nice thing is that there were only 6 members in the group and we only saw one other group the whole time. Stayed in the caves about an hour and a half. Then were treated to a \"snack\", which was actually more of a lunch. Chicken lime soup, empanadas, rice, beans and a couple of other things. I have been blessed to see and do some incredible things in my life, including hot air ballooning in Africa, dog sledding in Alaska and riding donkeys down a mountain in Greece -- Rio Secreto definitely ranks right up there in the top ten coolest things I've ever done. Would do it again in a heartbeat, and hope to be able to one day. Don't miss out on this!NOTE: You are not allowed to take cameras. I read where a couple of people fussed about this. Trust me, there's NO way you could take photos yourself. They have a photographer and we purchased the package of pictures -- 30 for $69. Worth every penny -- they were beautiful!"

I doubt this could happen in the US because of insurance restrictions; it's not easy at times, a little tight in places, but over all spectacular. You would think because of all the signage on the highway and advertising that it would be a tourist trap-- not at all. An experience like no other, natural, informative, and worth every penny.

There are many cennotes in the Playa del Carmen area, but Rio Secreto provides the opportunity to walk through and swim in an underground cennote.This cennote was only found in 2005, and it is in pristine condition. They only use about 10% of the whole length of this cennote, in order to protect the rest of this cennote system. The Rio Secreto is a dedicated cennote experience (which is what we were looking for), rather than being part of a larger theme style park.The formations are just break-taking throughout the length of the cennote, as are the colours within the cennote. A guide takes you through the cennote in small groups (they divided 12 people into two groups when we were there). The walking inside the cennote is easy, you just need to watch your step, but will provide you with a walking pole if you think you need better balance. The water temperature remains around 25 degree C all year, but you have wetsuits as well.You are not allowed to use your own camera - as this would disrupt the tour for the rest of your group, destroy the overall experience, and slow down the group. A photographer follows you through, and they provide excellent photos of your experience if you wish to buy them.Our guide was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, caring, and above all made you feel very safe. The tour price includes a buffet of local food at the end of the experience.They will do pick ups from your hotel (at an extra cost), but we choose to drive there ourselves and it was very easy to find, just south of Playa del Carmen on the main freeway."

Our very informative tour guide( I believe his name was Antonio who spent a year in Boston, he spoke good English and Spanish)suited us up with all the equipment we would need and we were off. Keeping the cave as natural as possible there were no walkways so at times footing was rough. I would not recommend to anyone who has any trouble walking or with balance problems. We went from shallow to deep water a few different times, learning about the cave and it's formations! The best of the trip for me was when we were swimming and we all turned out our lights which made us feel and experience the total quiet and darkness of this river deep underground. There was a small section that had about two feet of clearance with the top of the cave and the water which I also found cool and exciting.

Yes, I used the walking stick. I knew before I went, that it would be a physical challange for me, but I was bound and determined to see this wonder, and I am so glad I did! As long as my body doesn't get any worse, I would love to do it again. When we were finished our tour, we were offered a shot of, San Marino\" Xtabentun\". It tastes like Oozo! Also, I highly recommend getting the photo disc! The photgrapher takes many beautiful picts of the group, mayan ceremony, and lots of individual and couple picts. Along with the many picts of your day, there are also, so many breathtaking professional photos added onto your disc. Just think if you were going to hire a professional photographer at your home to take picts of you and your family, how much that would cost you? The photo disc has over a hundred picts on it. Plus for the $99.00 you also get a choice of three items. Can choose, 750ml bottle of the ceremony liquor (30% alc.), or T-shirts (same ones the staff wears) or hats, visors etc. You can choose to have 3 bottles, or 3 t-shirts, or 2 bottles and 1 shirt etc. We have 1 bottle and 2 shirts. So personally, I believe it is worth the $99.00. Memories can fade, pictures will last. (just say'in)."

Carnival got us from the ship to the Ferry. Once we got off the ferryat Playa del Carmen, they had someone there to pick us up at the dock and escort us to the bus that took us to the Rio Secreto. There, we were greeted and instructed to suite up (shower, wet suite, water shoes, life vest, and helmet with light) to go into the underground river. It was amazing! Our guide (Leon) was great. He took his time for us to navigate the stalagmite and for us to observe the wonderful setting. The floating in the underground river was the best part. One of my trip mates is closterphobic and did great! After the tour, we arrived back on the surface and ate lunch provided by Rio Secreto. They then returned us to the Playa del Carmen dock with enough time to shop prior departure for Cozumel. Rio Secreto made sure we were back on the ferry in time to get back to our ship in Cozumel. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone!"

The underground caves were cool but tromping around through stalagmites was a little scary and most of us ended up a bit scraped at the end. The tour guide was a knowledgeable fellow and it was a decent tour, but I think we spent too much time in the caves, it could have been shorter. One lady on our tour got claustrophobic and had to stop for awhile but it didn't hamper us at all. The tour guides were friendly and helpful, I just thought it was a bit too long in the water. Nice area though, and I did learn somethings."

            "review": "Cruisers - Choose this unique adventure!. My husband and I enjoy opportunities to experience adventurous activities when travelling; particularly when cruising. If you are docking in Cozumel or Playa del Carmen, first you must take that 3 hour bus trip to see Chichen Itza. Next time, go to Rio Secreto! To get to Playa del Carmen from Cozumel, we had quite a rocky ferry ride, which left many seasick. However, the trip from Playa to this natural preserve was only about 25 minutes total by way of a van provided by this tour. Our guide (his name is escaping me, and I would love to give him recognition) was a man with an 'R' name from Mexico City with contagious passion for preservation and environmental studies. First, we needed to ask for permission from the Mayans to enter the cenote through a special ceremony. Then we entered a most beautiful, undisturbed, underground world. For 90 minutes, we walked and swam through the caverns; learning about the formations, unique wildlife, and the ongoing work to study and preserve this site. Rio Secreto provided wet suits and walking sticks for those who wanted. This excursion requires some comfort with swimming, as well as balance to maneuver the uneven terrain and rocks. After \"surfacing\" from the caverns, we toasted with a tequila drink (iced tea for those who preferred). Lastly, we were provided with lunch, which was filling, though nothing too special.The one disappointing note of this experience was the price for photos. They were much worse than I expected ...$99 for a disc, and $25 for a single photo. My husband and I wished to share a disc with two other couples we had befriended on our vacation, however negotiating this was a big hassle. If some of this money were specifically going to the preserve, I would feel differently. We were on a rapelling/waterfall jumping excursion with a dedicated photographer, and the picture cost was far more reasonable. Certainly, an experience I will not forget, with a great tour guide!"

From the Mayan Blessing ceremony through the breath taking Cenote expedition every moment was time well spent. Safety for the participants is top priority providing wet suites, life jackets, helmets with lights & water shoes. The importance of the conservation efforts through education is well worth the price of admission.Memories of your entire expedition are captured by a photographer who follows the group from start to finish and are available for purchase at a reasonable price. We most definitely recommend this excursion."

We were all given the do's and don'ts via a tv in several languages before being taken to the actual river system entrance. The groups were separated according to language, so there was no barrier in understanding our guide Paulo who was extremely knowledgable and informative on the creation of the various structures we encountered once we entered the cave. Before we entered the actual cave, we took part in a Mayan blessing for our safety. There is a photographer who follows the group around, taking pictures of you and the family/friends you are with which can be purchased after you exit the river system. Great care is taken as far as safety goes. Life jackets and helmets with lights are mandatory and supplied by the good people at Rio Secreto. It was interesting to see a jaguar print that had been left a few weeks earlier near the exit from the system, as well as some bones from a deer that were most probably a jaguar's dinner at some point in the past. The trek thu the river system is quite beautiful, and awesome once it's pointed out how long it takes for the formations to form. After the underground portion of the tour was over, we changed out of the wetsuits(provided) and viewed the pictures that were taken and given several options to purchase at a fair price. We were then given a light meal buffet style and then transported back to our resort. This is not a full day trip, a great way to spend a rainy afternoon. I would definitely recommend this excursion."

The entire subterranean experience was truly amazing!The Bad,As with many tours a light lunch was provided at the end prior to loading the bus for our return. Well much to our surprise we woke the next morning to nausea and indigestion. We thought a morning walk to place our beach towels would clear our discomforts. Boy were we wrong! It was all we could do to get back to our room and collapse on the bed. It was apparent that we had one seriously bad bout of food poisoning. We spent the next twenty-four hours in the fetal position with only water and trips to the toilet to throw up. Took two days before we could stomach anything. Too bad, could of been a memorable experience, but now it's all I can do to forget it!"

At 70 and 73 there isn't much that surprises us anymore BUT this is the exception!!!!!!! First of all you MUST believe the brochure when it states that you need to have no medical conditions including weight, neck, back, knee etc problems. You get the message. Granted, you can't bring in your own camera or video equipment but we understood that thoroughly within the first 10 seconds. For safety reasons you MUST have use of both of your hands. Benito, our guide, was incredible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Safety is first and foremost on his agenda. LISTEN to him word for word. This excursion is for anyone who, as kids, drew outside of the lines!! It truly is mindblowing. Before you enter the cave be sure to drink a bottle of water (DON'T EVEN THINK OF HAVING ALCOHOL in your system)!!!! The wet suit, etc. is heavy and seems even more so when you first begin When you reach the water it is like a soothing balm. Crack open your wallet and buy the pictures because never in your life may you have another encounter like this again!!! We will remember this forever!!!!!! Thanks again, Benito!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

The ride to the park gate is only about 15 minutes. Its another 20 minutes by van down jungle trails to the facility. Once we got there we were assigned a guide (Eva) who took us through the attraction. The undergrounder caves and river system was quite spectacular. There's about a 50-50 split between swimming (or bobbing along) and walking through the water. Some of the formations in the larger caves were unbelieveable and the guide had ways of surpizing us with their beauty.After we were finished the tour there was a light lunch and beer available for $3 each. We left our resort at 7:45AM and were back by 1 PM. By the way, towels are provided so you dont need to steal them from your hotel!I highly recommend this as the perfect tour for when you really dont want to lose a whole day to an excursion (with hours on a bus). Some physical ability is required but i'd rate that as no more than 2 out of 5 in terms of exertion. For balance and mobiility probably a 3 out of 5 required. Its also fairly cheap so if your in the area with a large family of teens and adults this is one trip everyone should be able to experience together."

It's going to be a little tour and that's it.\" I was really wrong. It started that way. Our guide Alanis/Antonio was really great. He explained all sorts of things about stalactites, stalagmites and the other formations. I actually learned a lot. And we ended up getting really gritty in this cenote. I was up to my head in the water, with the ceiling right above my head at one point. We were in a chamber in total darkness for a few minutes and it was really fun.During the trek a photographer took some pictures. At the end they wanted you to buy the pictures, as well as some others, on a DVD. The price of this DVD was disgusting. I think it was $69.00 USD. I didn't even bring that much money with me. So heads up on that if you would be interested in buying it. You can't bring your own camera in and stuff, so if you want pictures of you in there you really don't have a choice but to buy it.After the tour there is a sample of Mayan Tequila and a lunch. The Lime Soup was amazing. Aside from the outragious DVD price, it was well worth it!Also once you get there there is another ten minute ride to the actual cenote. Its a bit bumpy."

They've only been doing tours here since 2008, so it's very un-commercialized and the cenote was very natural and preserved. There are no artifical walkways or stairs (except in one small area in the beginning and end) which I loved. Beautiful formations and crystal clear water. You have to walk through some parts and swim through others. Swimming was the fun part. There are two separate routes, one of them has a lot more swimming than the other, so call and ask for which ever route you want - they may or may not be able to accommodate you. I think the tour with more swimming is called \"Supremo\" but I am not sure. I heard it has about 10 minutes of swimming without being able to touch the ground. Of course your life jacket will keep you above water. You don't need to know how to swim to go on this tour. Do NOT go if you have mobility issues or any problem maneuvering through small areas on unsteady ground. You could easily fall and get injured on this tour. It's also very possible that you will get scraped by rocks on your legs.Wet suits, aqua shoes, life jackets, and helmets provided. No pictures allowed. They take pictures for you throughout the tour and you can choose from 3 packages. $99 for all pictures, t-shirts, and hat. $69 for all pictures on a CD. Or ONE picture on a CD for $25. Outrageous prices but you will definitely want at least one picture. That was the only negative part of this experience. Paulo the tour guide was great."

It was cheaper, we had more options for when the tour started and it was easy to get to by collectivo (minibuses you can catch beside the highway; cost $3 US or 300 pesos). After an introductory video we were taken by bus (20 min) to the site. Our guide was Nunes. You just have to bring a bathing suit. There are lockers with keys to store your clothes and valuables. You get suited up with water shoes, wet suit, life jacket and helmet with light. After a blessing from a Mayan elder we entered the cave. We had never been in one this extensive. It was beautiful. Nunes was very attentive to our safety warning us of any possible dangers. You do have to go through sections where your feet won't touch bottom in the water so if you have any fear of water (in a dark cave) then this trip may not be for you. My daughter saw some of the blind fish. The stalagtite, stalamite and column formations were beautiful. There were some bats but not in huge numbers. We were in the cave system for about 1 h. The picture package at the end varies from around $50 - $100 US. The price is a bit steep but we had never had pictures like these before so we ended up getting them. There was a nice lunch at the end. Don't forget to tip your guide. The kids (8 and 12) loved it. Awesome trip."

Once there, we had to shower off all of our body oils, etc. and then we headed for the caves. Our guide was Alex, who was AMAZING, and there were only 6 people in our group. Before we went down into the caves, we were blessed by a shaman, which was very cool even though he was wearing a name badge (?). The caves were incredible. I thought I would be nervous/scared, but I really wasn't. I can't really describe what an amazing experience it was. We were in the caves for at least an hour, swimming and walking. At one point, we sat in total darkness and silence, it was really magical. The meal afterwards was pretty good and the photos were very expensive, but we paid $69 for the photo package because it really was a once in a lifetime experience that we wanted to remember always. I HIGHLY recommend this adventure!"

The ride from the entrance to the staging area can be a little disconcerting especially if your driver is a little heavy on the pedal, but if you ask him to take it easy, he will.Once you're at the staging area and you meet your guide, the ball gets rolling pretty quickly (depending on your group size/composition). Lockers are provided for ALL your things. I say all because the only thing you can take with you are the swimsuit you're wearing and prescription glasses. Watches, jewelry (if you have lots of piercings this can take a while), cameras, hats, all these things will stay behind.Once you're geared, your group approaches the entrance where you have a short ceremony to receive a blessing from the Mayan Gods before entering the caverns, as the Maya treat such things as sacred. Safety and preservation of the natural spaces are always maintained while you walk/wade/swim through the rio. Breathtaking is an understatement for describing what you see (or don't see if your group is okay with a minute of total darkness, do it!!). There was a recent incident where a tourist broke a stalagmite which was tragic from a preservation standpoint, but gave us the opportunity to hold a piece of it up close, which was fascinating.In addition to your guide, a professional photographer is there shooting both candid and posed images of your group and the whole tour. The photo quality of our groups shots was amazing. The price for just a CD of all the images, plus a set of images that was used in their bid to the Mexican government to become a nature preserve was only $60USD, $90USD gets you the CD and any three souvenir items (dri-fit shirt, hat, etc) which is a pretty good value, but I had plenty of shirts already.Buffet meal at the end wasn't extravagant, but tasty, and adds much to the value of the tour cost. All in all a wonderful experience, I would have been quite happy to immediately go through again."

Upon arrival we were outfitted with knee length wet suits, a helmet with a light, and water shoes. One of the men in our party was 270 pounds (at least that is what he admits to) and they had no trouble finding a wet suit that fit him perfectly. After a brief Mayan blessing, we descended thru the cenote into an underground cave. The caves are geologically spectacular--we have been to many caves and were in awe of the incredible stalagmites and stalagtites. We walked, waded, and swam thru the cave. They limit the group to 10 people and the guide is very careful to explain to people when to watch out for submerged rocks and where to walk to avoid injury. It wouldn't be a good idea to do this tour if you have serious mobility issues--but my husband was 1 year out from having a total hip and did just fine--especially since they provided him with a walking stick for extra stability. I have \"mild\" claustrophobia and did fine--I don't like squeezing thru tight places and feeling stuck in caves. There was one area where you had to crouch to get thru--but otherwise, no tight squeezes. We were so impressed with the tour and wanted to preserve memories so we decided to buy the DVD with pictures at the end of the tour--which is very uncharacteristic of us. We are hoping that we can visit again during the \"off season\". They are planning longer more extensive tours during the summer months."

However, this trip takes you almost 250 feet below earths surface to explore underground rivers and caves that are still being explored. Towards the end you actually swim more then walk. Overall, this is a pretty tame guided tour, but if you are afraid of tight spaces and the dark, go with caution. I loved this excsurion and recommend it to anyone!"

It was truly an amazing, once in a life time excursion. Our guide, Alfredo, was fantastic, we felt comfortable and safe and enjoyed ourselves. Our group ran the gamut from the very fit to the not so fit, and we were all able to handle this excursion and no one seemed either too overwhelmed nor bored or \u201cunchallenged\u201d. The equipment provided was clean and in great condition, the grounds were beautiful and well tended. We weren\u2019t expecting but really enjoyed the inclusion of Mayan culture in the form of a blessing at the beginning of the journey. The information and sights were breathtaking. We are not ones to normally buy excursion souvenirs, but the amazing photos and t=shirt package was, we felt, a bargain at $99. We also were expecting a \u201csnack\u201d, but had a great (really tasty!) buffet lunch with delicious fruits, salads, rice, empenadas, beans - it was really good! I\u2019m so glad we did get the pictures because that place is almost unreal now to think back about the caves and the water.... Thanks for a once in a lifetime experience!! Highly recommend!"

If you are staying between Tulum and Playa del Carmen, take the Collectivo for 35 pesos or 3 american dollars per way. It runs up and down that Highway. Ask about it. It is WAY cheaper than paying a taxi or shuttle 60$. You can't bring any cameras into the cave, which I get because not only are they trying to make money off of you, but they don't want anyone leaving anything down there. This was an amazing experience!! Plus, the authentic lunch after was very good. Much better than the American crappy food served at our resort."

We were impressed with the follow up service the week prior to our departure asking us to confirm our room and resort for driver pick up. Our driver was extremely punctual and very pleasant. We were taken to a Rio Secreto reception area where we transferred onto another vehicle that took us 10 km over gravel roads surrounded by jungle to the Rio Secreto cave site. Once at the site we were grouped according to our spoken language to ensure we had an appropriate guide and then we gathered on benches to view an information video on the underground river and area. Guides in many different languages are available. We were provided with wetsuits, life jackets, and helmets equipped with led headlights. Our group size was ten people to a guide and photographer and we were traveling with children ages five and eight. We walked through the jungle to the cave entrance where we gathered in a ceremonial setting to receive a Mayan blessing to enter the underworld, which they consider sacred.After receiving the blessing we walked down several slippery steps into a large area inside of the cave where we were informed that the last natural light would be available and we would have to turn on our headlights going further into the cave. Our guide, Paulo, was excellent at pointing out formations and features in the cave that we would otherwise have missed. The cave was magnificent with crystal clear turquoise water, cathedrals, coral formations and magnificent stalagmites and stalagtites. Our children received an excellent educational experience from Paulo, our amazing guide. Parts of the cave were very narrow and some parts very low where we were required to crouch down so we didn't bump and damage a formation. We were instructed to help each other along as we walked single file through the cave and our guide helped people in the group every time they needed assistance to keep everyone safe. If an individual was claustrophobic, had mobility issues, or a fear of swimming in deep water even with a life jacket this cave experience could be problematic. The water we had to swim through was cool but with the wet suit and life jacket we quickly adjusted to the temperature and being inside the cave was so spectacular. Paulo pointed out a spider on the cave wall that had adapted to the total darkness, it had six legs and two front legs had turned into antennae so the spider could find its prey. Cave mappers were mapping the cave while we were there and pointed out a rare find of jaguar footprints near the cave exit. Paulo also pointed out bats in the cave ceiling and fish in the water. The cave system was massive. We were inside the cave for an hour an a half and the company allows only ten percent of the cave to be explored while keeping ninety percent preserved. They have done a very good job keeping the tour groups small for an intimate experience preserving the delicate formations and ecosystem. When we exited the cave we were taken to an area where we were given liquor made from anise and honey and our children were give iced tea and we celebrated the experience with our guide and the group. Our equipment was removed and we were allowed to change into dry clothing and then were taken to a covered shaded area of picnic tables and were invited to a sumptuous buffet of hot foods, soups, fresh fruit and beverages.Cameras are not permitted inside the cave and a photographer followed the group taking individual photos along the way. At the end of the tour these photographs are available for purchase. We bought the complete package and many other photos of the cave and formations as well as photos of the jungle flora and fauna were included and we felt the price was not prohibitive having traveled to Disney knowing the price of photos taken there. For ninety dollars we received a photo CD of all our pictures plus the additional photos (about 79 in total), a bottle of liquor and two t-shirts. A review of this attraction really doesn't do the area justice, one has to see the splendor of the caves to appreciate them first hand. I would advise anyone capable of managing this tour to put it on your \"must do\" list. Phenomenal experience!! Will definitely go back."

It is my opinion that you should be given the choice to buy the pro pictures (theirs are certainly better than the ones you could take yourself), or to take your own pics.

Because there are many ways to enter the caves each group is made to feel like theirs in an exclusive journey. After donning our wet suits and water shoes, the six of us plus guide first met a Mayan medicine man who told a story of peoples long ago. Some ancestors found the caves to be like the womb of the Mayan people as it contained the fresh water that sustained them. Others experienced the caves as if it were an underworld like the Greek House of Hades. As we journeyed through the water and passages directed by the beam of our helmet lights and the person in front it was fascinating to imagine both wading through the river of Styx and being baptized in the womb of the Mayan people. If you go expect a short period when the guide asks everyone to shut off his light and be still as you float in one of the cave's pools. It's a trip."

My wife said \"oh come on, we are on vacation, lets try it we may never have a chance like this again\", so reluctantly, I agreed. Well, I was blown away by the natural beauty of this cave. It is 100% untouched by man with no fancy lighting or hand rails. All you get is reality in all it's glory. You are taken through the cave with a guide in small groups according to what language you speak, down into a set of stone stairs directly into an area of the cave that acclimates you to what you will be experiencing for the next 90 minutes. I believe this is to check for claustrophobia before embarking any further. When all seems well, you begin your descent and right away you are mesmerized by the natural beauty. As you look up, raindrops glisten like little diamonds under the light from your helmet from all the stalactites hanging from the ceiling. We are 56 and a little heavy weight wise, however we were able to navigate through the cave with very little help from the guide and person in front of us. This is one thing they stress and urge you to do, walk with confidence and turn and help the person behind you, so yes it is a bit of a work out in some parts so be prepared.This cave is not a man made structure, this is Nature in all its splendor. You are given a wet suit, water shoes, life vest, and a helmet with a light on it. There are spots in the water that are 4-5 feet deep but they only span for about 30 feet so your time in deep water is brief, however you float quiet well with the suit and jacket so non swimmers will have no trouble. I found the wet suit to be a little cumbersome but it must be worn to protect you from some of the sharp edges of the cave and stalagmites and corals. A photographer also follows the group and takes group and individual pictures along the way. At one point, we sat in a circle in the shallow water while the guide explained about the organic benefits of the sand and silt, we were encouraged to rub it on our skin as a natural body scrub. Everybody then turned off their flashlight to see how dark it was in the caves, you couldn't see a hand in front of your face.At the end, as we ascended the stairs to exit, was a small alter where any items found in the cave were left as an offering for the gods. Nothing is allowed to leave the caves. All in all, it was an amazing experience that ended too quickly. Our only disappointment was the costs of the photos. We thought that for the costly price of admission, as there is no way you could take your own camera (you need both hands to navigate your way through) one should be given a souvenir photo. Photos could be purchased for $25 each or a CD of about 10-12 photos for $69. As we hadn't brought enough cash or a credit card with us, we left with only our minds eye memories."

I was pleasantly surprised at how natural and intact the site is in its undisturbed state. We selected the visit because it was not an all day commitment during our recent stay in Cancun. We were taken by our Best Day Tour sponsored guide to the site which was about an hour out of Cancun. The location was near the other attractions that are well publicized in the Cancun area. The advertised underground caverns share the same passages and water features that so far have been mapped out to be around 13 miles underground. We were told that the more commercialized access at the other attractions were heavily modified to handle a larger number of visitors. The Rio Secreto operations is sponsored by the original discoverer of the site and has only been open since 2009 or so. The limit the visits to about 400 visitors a day and in groups of no more than 10 per guide. Each group sets off in wet suits, lighted helmet and floatation jacket. We started off with a traditional Mayan shaman ritual before entering the caverns. Since there are multiple trails, you don't encounter other visitors except for your immediate group. They have the capacity to take groups in language specific needs which is specified during the booking process. It was a terrific experience to descend down into the site donning the equipment and appropriate footwear. All equipment was provided on site, along with lockers to store all your personal items. No jewelry, watches, or photographic equipment can be taken along. There is an assigned photographer which while compile images for your purchase at the end of the excursion. The natural formations, pools, and rivers were amazing. We had a chance to follow a trail, float in water filled chambers, and experience a complete light out experience to listen to the water drops falling that formed the many formations. The tour lasted about 90 minutes which is about enough. You had to be careful of not touching or bumping the rock formations. Although it was not physically difficult, those less comfortable walking in dim lighting, along potentially rough surfaced rock formations, and floating in confined spaces may feel a little anxious., My family with kids ranging from 13-22, including my son with special needs, thoroughly enjoyed it. The meal served at the end was very tasty and offered the Mayan style cuisine in a pleasant outdoors setting. We also had the opportunity to see some local wildlife as they passed through our dining area. Overall, everyone in our group of 11 had a great time and note the experience as a highlight activity. I would recommend this without hesitation."

The bumpy ride to the caves is a fun journey through natural jungle. They take care to preserve the site by not paving the road so the water purity is not contaminated. They also ask you not to wear sunscreen and you will have to shower before going into the cave. Our guide Paulo was very knowledgeable and his reverence and respect for this sacred place was appreciated. He made the journey special because he was just as taken with the place as we were even though he sees it everyday twice a day. I felt like a time traveller as we explored the wonderous sites that have taken thousands and thousands of years to create. What we saw is unchanged from what the Mayan people saw thousands of years ago as it takes several thousand years just to build an inch of stalactites.It was great to have the photographer along to take pictures as they don't allow cameras in the caves. Our 21 and 25 boys were not keen on going but felt they had a real adventure and were stoked that they went.It is a good value and an unforgetable journey."

Our small group was led and taught by Alfredo, a true lover of his job. His respect and knowledge of what we were experiencing was something that will stay with me for a very long time. Thank you, Alfredo for sharing with us. The van ride back to the site was something similar to a roller coaster ride. Word of advice, better buckle your seat belt.Please take the time during your vacation to visit Rio Secreto to share this wonder. Lunch is included in your visit and they take photos for purchase."

I absolutely love the caves/caverns, stallactites/stallagmites. It is really an awesome adventure. How this can be so beautiful and all underground is beyond ones imagination. The ride back to the cave is a roller coaster so if you get queasy don't sit in the back of the van. It is only a half day adventure so you still have beach time left after leaving here. The food was good and the Anise liquor was something new for us to taste."

            "review": "Must See!. This adventure is amazing! The guide teaches you so much about the cave system and is patient. The groups are small (there was a total of 9 in our tour) so you get personal service - which sounds strange for a cave, but let me explain. I'm not a very good swimmer - in fact - I am afraid of deep water. I have always been ok with a life jacket, but I had some issues in the deep water in the cave - probably the combination of a dark cave, strangers around me, and deep water :) The guide let me hold on to her life jacket and she actually pulled me through the water - above the call of duty! I have always been a hiker and have hiked in and out of many, many caves around the world, but this one was different. Many cave sites have lights inside - this one didn't. Other than the guides flashlight and the head lamps from the hard hats, it was all natural in there. To be a tourist attraction - they have done an EXCELLENT job of keeping it natural. The cost of admission inlcudes everything you need and you get a free locker to keep your belongings in. You can't take your own pictures, but they take photos for you. They are expensive, but it is such an amazing place that you really need those photo memories. There are 3 packages. $99 gets you all your photos (and whoever you are traveling with) and some professional photos of the cave itself plus 2 tee shirts and a bottle of Mayan alcohol. $69 (the option I took) gets you the same photos as the $99 package - just not shirts or alcohol. $25 gets you ONE photo on a CD. As many cave systems as I have been in, I found myself getting a little panic stricken in this one - but I did hold it together. I think it was the fact it is so dark and you will climb into some tight places. They do have a staff member that will escort you back out while the group goes on if you need it and just knowing I could leave anytime I wanted to was enough to keep me going. This excursion is well worth the cost. You will not be disappointed. Even if you feel sometimes get those panic like feelings give this one a try anyway. It will be one of my most cherished memories. I just did this 2 days ago and I would love to do it again!"

Our guide, Rodrigo, was great and we did the route called Supreme.Everything else about the tour was great, as well. There is an adequate shower and changing area for before and after the tour. Guests are given lockers and each guest holds onto their own key during the tour. All of the equipment was in good, working order. Last but not least, the food they served after the tour was excellent and there was plenty of it for all.After experiencing this, Cozumel has jumped from the cruise port of call I sought to avoid to the one I like best. Even though this is one of the more expensive excursions, I would definitely do it again the next time I visit the Yucatan."

There we met our tour guide who split us in 2 groups: Spanish and English speakers. This was really convenient. After giving us all the details of the tour and signing the disclaimers forms, we had a 40 min ride approximately to the reserve. The trip was a little bit long and the road is rocky (it cannot be paved) but it was worth it. When we arrived to the natural reserve we were assigned a Guide, Rodrigo, who was absolutely awesome. Groups were made of 8-10 people and they were very well organized. Do not wear any suntan lotions, creams, etc. since you will have to shower before going down to preserve the environment. After this, we were given all the equipment and the journey began. The tour starts with a Mayan ceremony to receive the blessing, after a short walk through the jungle and then you are ready to go down to the caves. The views are absolutely amazing. Being in contact with almost virgin caves and the peaceful feeling in the dark is something you can't miss. Our guide Rodrigo was very friendly and ready to answer all of our doubts and questions. Depending on your age and training level you may want to take the stick offered at the begging considering that sometimes the road is uneven and little rocky. There isn't much swimming to do in case you wonder, and if you are not very experienced in that department the guide or any member of the group will be willing to help you. After the excursion you are offered a Mexican snack which was average, but at least it was something. Anyway, it is one best the excursions I have ever made. I would definitely recommend this tour and do it again! We had a blast!!! In one word this excursion is AMAZING!! P.S.: As in all the excursions they will offer to take pictures because it is not allowed to take your camera down, they can be a little expensive but they are worth the money. Incredible memories!"

For better or for worse, I think the theme of Rio Secreto as a cenote is \"unspoiled\".On the one hand, the caves are stunning, especially the sense you get that you could wander off from the group and find all kinds of undiscovered secrets. There are essentially no lights other than the ones you have on your helmet, and only a thin string to suggest a recommended path.On the other hand, the unspoiled element makes everything else feel fairly rustic. To get from the sign-in office to the staging area, you have to ride about 10 minutes in a VERY bumpy road in a van packed with 10 other tourists. Our driver got lost, TWICE. Upon arrival at the staging area, you're given wet shoes & suit. Notably, they are wet, as in someone just wore them and they were washed but not dried. You're required to shower in the outdoor shower area that uses unheated water. When you get finish the trek, you're treated to a meal, although there is no real trace of meat and only a hint of cheese in the options that are offered to you.Finally, you're also offered photos of your trip, since they forbid you from bringing cameras into the caves. The packages are around USD $70.Overall, the caves are truly special. The guides in the caves are excellent. The business of getting there and coming back is quite barebones."

Very intense, enjoyable tour; not scary in my opinion.This is not a party area, beach club or water attraction, it is a natural, ecological wonder and protected area under current study. This cave system demands and deserves respect; if you take the tour, PLEASE be mindful of the rules that are in place to protect this area's amazing beauty! Can't wait to visit again!

No one tried to sell us anything all day, and even the ride to and from town was good. A must do if ever in the area!"

The tour guides are friendly and helpful, and the overall experience is once in a lifetime. The only heads up I would give is to bring along about $70 for pictures because you can't bring your own camera in! Also smile when they take your pictures so you can have some good memories to bring home."

I'd highly recommend this trip, it's only about 20 minutes from the hotel and they will come and pick you up. Don't bother bringing your camera as they dont allow it inside the caves and you have to use their photographer."

Though we were a bit late for our scheduled tour, the operators quickly booked us with a bi-lingual tour and Joan, our guide, took care to translate virtually every word for our benefit. The mayan blessing before entering the cenote made it an authentic experience. The cave must be seen to be believed. The geological features are unique and you come into close contact with formations that transform the landscape from chamber the chamber.The extensive tour on foot really was comfortable due to the fine gear provided. The post tour lunch was delicious and substantial. We would recommend this adventure to anyone wishing to take a memorable journey into the caves of the Yucatan!"

Entrance is quite expensive around USD 170 for 2 aduts and 1 child but the place is worth it. Since there are always guides around in the cenote, elderly and younger people get help when needed. This is definately no adventure park like the ones close by, but a very nicely organised tour of 800 m under ground through caves, rivers and small lakes.Pictures at the end are too high priced, but see if you can arrange for a deal for the whole group."

Once you arrive at attraction staging area near PDC, there is another over 30 minute unpaved bumpy van ride to actual cave site. You wait again then gear up and hike to cave. The Mayan ceremony interesting and cave guide very knowledgable. Would not recommend this trip for small children or elderly. Dark, narrow steep passage ways with constant reminder from guide not to touch cave structures made it very easy to slip and fall. Ask for the walking stick. The van overheated and broke down on the way back to hotel adding to a very long \"day trip\"!"

We were lucky to have him! The cave/underground river was beautiful-a true wonder of the world and worth the visit. Like many of the other attractions, you can't bring in your own camera, but they do have a disk of photos available for purchase. A couple of things to note that I read from other reviewers:-Yes, the road is rough getting from the reception area to the \"jungle.\" But you're going to the jungle, so what did you expect? Some drivers do a better job navigating the road than others, as we experienced first hand as we had a different driver take us back to reception.-You're in the jungle. Its a nature preserve. The facilities are reflective of that. The bath rooms and changing area was a lot like being at camp. The Equinox Athletic Club its not.-The food that we were served after our excursion was fine. Its not a Michelin five star experience, but for $69, don't think you get a meal at French Laundry for that.Also, if staying in Playa del Carmen, and you don't have a car, you don't need to purchase the transportation package from Rio Secreto. Your hotel can arrange a cab for you for $15. And in our case, the cab driver came back to pick us up after our excursion.I should also note that our drive out into the jungle was made worse, not by the bumpy, unpaved road, but because our driver was texting-yes texting-during the entire 7km drive out there. As our friends reminded me, its not illegal to text and drive in Mexico. Sure, but its not exactly a great impression to leave with the folks visiting your location. Oh, and he played completely inappropriate club music. So, fair warning if this guy is still working there.Despite the texting driver, I am happy that Rio Secreto made the short list of activities that we managed during our trip. Well worth it."

The office and gathering spot is right off the main hwy but you will ride in a van for 20 min down a very dusty, extremely pot hole filled road to get back to the cave. Others have explained the procedures of showering & doning wetsuits etc. There is a \"purification\" ceremony done by a Myan priest with smoke & incense before entering the cave. This is taken very seriously and everyone paid rapt attention. Our guide spoke excellent english and had a great sense of humor. I think he made it enjoyable for everyone in the group. With it being so dark and wet there is no way you could take pictures on your own. We did not mind spending the $100 to buy their package with pictures on a CD, a bottle of potent liquor & 2 T-shirts as the money goes back to support Rio Secreto and we were happy to make this our donation. If you have a car rental be sure to checkout the advertising on the back of the paperwork folder. There is an ad for one free entry to Rio Secreto with the purchase of an entry. (buy one get one free) This will save you $69This cave is not for those with any balance or walking problems."

The actual time spent inside this underground cavern/cave is about 1hr 30 mins. All equipment is provided with your admission, and the tours are split into small groups. Our guide was Victor, he did a great job taking care of us and also spoke very good English. The tour begins with a 7 km van ride to the entrance of the cave, expect a bumpy ride as the roads are unpaved to preserve the natural condition of the site. The inside of the cave and underground rivers are gorgeous, it lets you witness the beauty of nature. The underwater rivers are so clear that you can see the cat fish swimming in it. The cave is very much alive in its natural form. After the tour, the buffet that they serve is also one of the best we've had during our time in Mexico."

Rio Secreto is one of these places that nature has produced over the millenia and is almost impossible to do justice to in a written (or verbal for that matter) description - it has to be seen and experienced! Time passes without your knowing it. The guide makes the one and a half hours an unforgettable trip. The caverns are full of stalagmites, amazing needle-like stalagtites and crystal clear water in which you are mostly up to your knees but also sometimes swimming. There is very little artificial lighting, the only light being from the little lamp on your and your companions helmets and this lends to the beauty of the caverns. Don't miss it if you are in the Riviera Maya area!! You can buy a CD with very professional photos of your experience."

            "review": "Loved it until I went to Xplor. My husband and I went on the tour to Rio Secreto during a 7-day stay at the Iberostar Paraiso Lindo (highly recommend this hotel). We booked our trip online through the Rio Secreto website in anticipation of saving a few dollars. Upon arrival at our hotel, we realized it was five dollars cheaper when booked through Olympus Tours. So perhaps you should call your hotel and find out the tour rates through the resort before making your decision on where to purchase tickets if this is the tour for you. We loved the tour until we went to Xplor. My advice is to pay the extra $25 a person and go to Xplor. If I had the chance to do it all over again, I would not choose to go to Rio Secreto unless the price was cut by 50%. Upon arrival at the tour we took a bumpy ride (about 20min) to the cave entrance. I'm easily car-sick so this didn't sit well with my stomach, but this part of the tour was easily forgotten when everything was said and done. We had to take a freezing cold shower once we stripped down to our swimsuit to help preserve the cave system and this was not enjoyable at all. Next we suited up in wet suits and helmets and water shoes and lifejackets. The wet suit was a nice addition they didn't provide in Xplor. Before the cave mouth we participated in a Mayan ceremony. A little Cotis animal (kind of like a dog but with a long furry tail and cute needle snout) followed us around scurrying from tree to tree to paw at the strings on our life jacket. He was a Rio Secreto pet named Chuck. He stole the show. During the tour of Rio Secreto we did have a wonderful guide so it was personalized with information and the cave was magnificent. We had the choice of taking along a walking stick or braving the tour without one and I was glad I chose to take the stick. The water was brisk and refreshing, clear to the bottom, and most of the tour was spent hobbling over the rocky bottom in the dim light afforded by our helmet lights. There were a few stretches where we could rest and float along the river but most of the tour was a struggle not to trip and fall against very sharp rock. Overall, the experience was amazing and if I hadn't gone to Xplor I would recommend it. We ate a quaint lunch outdoors on picnic tables making selections from a small buffett. Water and iced tea were free to drink but sodas and alcohol were cash items. My favorite part of the tour was the time we spent swaying in hammocks waiting for the bus to take us home. That said, for $25 dollars more, Xplor has an equally magnificent cave system full of photo stops where a motion sensor triggers a camera flash. The river is deep and winding and it is so relaxing to just float along and not worry about tripping and twisting an ankle. We also were able to enjoy the cave system in so many different ways. We could float the 45min swimming route or paddle a boat through the shallow river trails or take a ten-minute walk through the cave or even drive ATVs through the jungle with small portions of driving through waterfalls and inside the cave system. If you're adventurous you can even zip line from high stone towers, spiral down water slides, take a ride in a hammock chair through a high waterfall and splash into the water. Xplor has a Beverage Bar with fantastic smoothies and juice drinks and you can taste them all for free whenever you wish. The restaurant is huge and beautifully constructed with a giant buffet spread and you can visit it multiple times to snack or you can sit down for a long meal beneath the palapa roof. The price difference between Rio Secreto and Xplor was just $25 a person and I have to say the experience at Xplor was more than worth the extra money. For what Rio Secreto offers, I feel that they overcharge in comparison with what else is out there. My recommendation is to jump on the bus to Xplor and perhaps take a tour to the Coba ruins where you can still trek up the pyramid (Chichen Itza no longer allows this). Or if you are part of a travel group with younger kids, go to Xcaret. Whatever you do, you will have a blast, that's for sure."

Before they started their excursion @ RIO SECRETO, they paid using an ATM card. They were overcharged (them not knowing it came out to be $925 US Dollars instead of 925.00 MX PESOS). Once they got back from their trip to the states, my dad and I were checking out his bank statement & noticed the overcharge. Yes that is a lot of money folks!!! Ninehundred twenty five dlls instead of 925 pesos (that rounds out to be around $75.00 including taxes that should have been charged for their excursion of 2 people). I am lit !!!! I have been in contact with RIO SECRETO ADMINISTRATION for 2 months now and still have not been refunded the money. They say their going to reimburse us, but nothing yet so far. I'm trying not to lose my patience and cuzz out these people who don't seem to care about the overcharge. I can't count how many times they have promised to refund the money, and nothing shows up on my paren'ts bank statement. It seems like every week if I don't contact them via email and even international expensive phone calls, they won't get a hold of me and let me know what's going on. They seem very nonchalant over the phone and say they understand the situation and that things are in progress, and nothing!!!! Please don't visit RIO SECRETO unless you don't care about your money.

The road into the caves and the walking once in the caves takes out anyone who can't handle uneven surfaces or can't handle rough terrain. Pre-Madonna everything has to be perfect people should pass.. Now out of the other side of my mouth I'll tell you that I've been to too many US National Parks to count (Mammoth Cave, Grand Canyon, YellowStone, Yosemite, Glacier, Everglades, Big Bend, Mt. Rushmore, Volcano, Acadia), been to the base of Kilamanjaro/Noromongoo Crater, Niagara Falls, etc and I can say this experience ranked right up there with any those. Serious.Tour cost $129 US pp with transportation. Our bus picked us up at 8:30 at the resort in Cancun and after picking up others the driver took us to the check in area. There are food and drinks available for purchase and a nice waiting area. Beware of bugs and bees. At the check in area you are divided into Spanish or English groups of 8 to 10 in a group and loaded onto vans. The roughest ride you have had in a van will take 15 minutes and 7km to get you to the jungle/cave check in. Once there you'll take a COLD shower to wash soaps and perfumes off you then you get a locker for your belongings. You are issued a wet suit, shoes, and a helmet. There are no walking sticks provided. You walk back a trail for 5-10 minutes then get a Mayan blessing then head down into the cave. The water is cold when you first step in but is tolerable with the suit. There are different sections of the caves that guides go in to try and space people away from each other. We went on the \"Joy\" section and it was great. You are underground for around 1.5 hours. There were at least 2 sections where I couldn't touch and had to float or swim and I am 6'4\". No cameras are allowed so they send a photographer with each group but get ready for some SERIOUS sticker shock on the price of the pics.... Once done with the tour you take off your equipment, you get a drink and the picture packages are presented then a buffet style lunch is served. Great food including; soup, salads, tomalles, sauces, punch and water. After lunch you wait for the pics if you took them to be done then head to your bus. Tour bus picked us back up at 2:30 and headed back to Cancun.I like to pro and con when I rate and then give tips so here goes:ProsExperience is really one of a kind (place would be a National Park in US)Pretty organized operation from check in to getting on the bus to leave went smoothNice buses and facilities for the location (caves are in the jungle)Good food for lunch (authentic Mexican)Guides are excellent (Our guide Ava was from Spain)ConsBus rides in and out are CRAZY bumpy and very very rough.Walking in the cave can be tough, older lady in our group fell down pretty hard.Pictures are way overpriced when compared to price of admission (Had 3 packages 1) One picture was $25. 2) All pics on CD was $69. 3) All pics on CD, bottle of liqueur and t-shirt for $99.Groups are small but if you have any older or not sure footed people in the group that monopolize the guides time it is hard to hear.The groups are close together so if you have slow people in your group you'll miss out on quiet time in the cave,etc.Beer and soda is not included with lunch so take so extra cash.TipsSit near the front of the bus where you can see its like a bumpy roller coaster at times.Stay toward the front of the group when in the cave so you can hear and see everything that is pointed out.Take bug spray as waiting area is in the jungle and you'll need it.Again this trip isn't for everyone but we saw 4 year olds being taken down so if you can physically handle it... You won't be sorry. Have fun."

I don't usually book throught the cruise lines, but this is a must since you may get back to the ship late. In fact, we were back within 15 minutes of the last boarding. You take a ferry to Playa del Carmen and a bus ride to the location from there. The ride is about an hour, with the last 20 minutes being very bumpy. Once you arrive you're given a locker and asked to shower in order to remove some of the body oils. You're then given a wet suit, life vest, water shoes and helmet with a lite. Our guide was Alfredo, who was extremely passionate about the caves and their history. Once you start your amazing journey a photographer will be taking pics - of course to sell at the end...tho absolutely no pressure. The journey is remarkable, truly beautiful. The passage through the caves is sometimes challenging if you're not in average shape and for anyone with short legs since there's nothing to hold onto when climbing the higher or slippery steps. The water was wonderful and at times we couldn't touch the bottom. Afterwards we were offered a good buffet lunch. Every aspect of this tour was great and shouldn't be missed."

The caves were absolutely beautiful and gives you a renewed appreciation of the natural world. Our guide Paulo from Brazil, was amazing in his knowledge and perspective of the wonders of the cave and a beutiful site to look at as well. I have done many tours of sites around the worls, and this one ranks right up there in my top 2. I highly recommend it! It is an easy cab ride from playa car for 150-170 pesos and the admission was $69 usd. Sounds a little pricey but well worth it and included lunch as well!"

The cave formations are just surreal, the guides are very friendly, informative and fun. Dont bring your camera, they will not allow them into the cave. All the equipment you will need will be handed to you even shoes. Before going into the caves, a mayan priest will make a purification ritual prior entering their underworld. Food was good also, as it was an authentic mexican meal. I have read several complaintns about the ride, yes it is bumpy, still you have to consider the fact that we are going THROUGH A JUNGLE, and it was actually fun. WIll do it again."

            "review": "Amazing river.......but. Everything about the river was really amazing but that was the only good part of the excursion. We had to take a ferry, or better known as the SS Puke, from Cozumel to Playa del Carmen. They handed out barf bags as we got onto the boat. The boat held about 200 passengers and about half of them were sick during the 40 minute boat ride. Once we got off the boat, it didn't get any better. We then loaded up into vans and took about a 30 minute ride to the cave. This was almost as rough of a ride as the boat. Horrible! When we finally got to the actual river it was truly amazing. They broke us up into small groups which was helpful. They also provided all the equipment that you needed. The best part by far was when the guides had everyone turn off their lights and be quiet. Once we finished, they offered us lunch but the food was not good at all. It seemed as though it had been sitting all day. The fresh fruit was good. The pictures were also very expensive. They offered one picture for $25 and they put it on a disk for you. They don't have a gift shop which was a disappointment. Overall, the river was the only amazing part. The transportation, lunch, pictures and lack of a gift shop put a HUGE damper on the whole experience."

The caves were beautiful, maginificent... Two downsides. The first one, the road from the main road to the caves is very long and bumpy. It would be a nice added bonus to be able to ride ATVs in to the main area. Even with an added cost, I would've preferred that... If you get car sick, good luck!!The other downside, the facilities to change your clothes, the bathrooms, the showers, was very dirty and not well kept at all. When we were told that the area was only opened to the public in 2008, we were surprised to see the rundown area facilities. I still recommend going, simply for the caves, that are completely breathtaking!! As for pictures for a souvenir, they are crazy expensive, and since you cannot bring your own camera, bring some money. We paid 69$ for a cd with pictures of us. It was about 20$ for 1 picture. They really get you there!!They provide a good lunch with water to drink. However, you have to pay for soft drinks and juice."

            "review": "Amazing experience!. We were debating about whether to go to Rio Secreto or XCarat. When we asked several local people, they all agreed Rio Secreto was the place to go and they were right. This cave was only discovered in 2006 and opened to the public in 2008. Everything was done extremely well. Our transportation to and from the resort was on time and went smoothly. The above ground property was very well maintained and the people were extremely professional and well versed in English. You will meet at a gathering area prior to boarding another van for an EXTREMELY rough and bumpy ride (about 15-20 minutes) back to the cave area. If you get car sick, sit in the front of the van. They had a locker area to store your things but you don't need to bring anything but your bathing suit and if you have them, water shoes. Even towels are provided at the end of the tour. If you would rather change into your suit or bring a change of clothes for afterward, clean bathrooms and changing areas are available. First you will shower to remove any oils, sunscreen and dirt (this protects the delicate balance of the cave) and then you are suited in not-so-well-fitting wetsuits (it doesn't matter if they don't fit well...everyone looks the same), water shoes if you didn't bring them, life jackets, and hard hats with lights. Also provided are walking sticks. I had read on TripAdvisor that the walking sticks were recommended and told the rest of the group. All the women took them and the men didn't. Once we were underground, the men were second guessing this decision. The ground in the cave is uneven and slippery. Take a walking stick! Once your group is ready, you walk through the jungle and prepare to descend into the cenote. A Mayan elder did a blessing ceremony and our guide explained all that he said and why it was done. Very touching. Then the real magic begins as you decend into the cave and the beauty that lies underground. There are three paths through this nine mile cave so you won't run into another group. You wade in and out of 75 degree water with some areas up to waist deep. Toward the end of our tour, we floated through 9 feet of water. Being 60 feet underground was an amazing experience and the colors of the water and cave formations were just beautiful. Our guide, Lia, was very informative and spent a lot of time explaining what we were seeing. Expect to spend approximately 1 1/2 hours underground enjoying this magnificent wonder. Throughout the tour, a photographer took pictures of us individually, with our group and also as a couple. You are not allowed to take camera into the cave and it is for good reason. This allows you to enjoy the experience the cave fully and not worry about getting a good shot. We could never have gotten the photos they were able to capture. After the tour, you are able to purchase pictures. If you only want one photograph, it is $25. If you want all your photographs (we had 70-80 photos) on a CD, it is $69. You can also add your photos on a flash drive for $10 more. A nice buffet lunch was served prior to boarding the vans back to the resort. Since our resort was the furthest out, this was a full afternoon excursion. We left at 11:30 and didn't return until 5:30 that evening. It was well worth it and we never felt rushed at any point. I would highly recommend this amazing experience. It is something you could do with children as well however I would recommend it for ages 10 and up."

            "review": "Awesome Experience but rough ride getting there!. Rio Secreto is absolutely beautiful. My wife and I visited at a 1pm time slot. It is just south of Playa. Were were picked up by the Rio Secreto van at our hotel. Unfortunately they were about 20 minutes late so we were stuck in the lobby for about a half hour since you are told to be there 10 minutes before the van arrives, not really a huge deal breaker. Our driver checked us in and we were given wrist bands. Then we had to fill out a short form showing that we were physically able to take the tour. It is not for anyone that is claustrophobic or not nimble on their feet. After being assigned our tour guide we hopped in a van into the forest. This was the worst part of the experience. It is about a 20 minutes bumpy van ride to the final destination. I don't get car sick but there were a few feeling nauseous. The driver tried to avoid bumps but it was inevitable to hit them and the road seemed to go on forever since we had to go slow. Once we got there we were elated to be out of the van. We were met by our guides, ours was Pablo. He is on the website showing Hugh Hefner's old girlfriend the cave. Pablo was great. You could tell he loved his job and cared about the natural wonder. He had a great sense of humor. He explained in great detail about the history of the cave and the formations. The tour is a little over half walking in and out of water and then some swimming. The water was chilly, around 75 degrees. There are three paths and the guide will pick which one you take through the cave. The beauty of the cave erased all thoughts of the van ride. A photographer walks with the group of 10 and takes pictures since cameras aren't allowed. It is for safety reasons since the terrain is pretty rough and you would hold up the group taking pictures, let alone ruin your camera unless you had a waterproof one. Overall the tour was great, the only downside was the extremely bumpy van ride to and from the cave. If you don't get car sick or mind a rough 40 total minutes in a van, this is a must trip!!!!!! I highly recommend it! The picture prices are 1 for $25, all for $69, or all the pictures with two shirts and a bottle of liquor for $99. We went with the $99 package."

After reading reviews of both, I chose Rio Secreto because I brought my mom (60 years old) there and I don't think she can be out in the sun from 8a.m. to 9 p.m. It turned out that I made the right choice.. the experience there was awesome, breathtaking, amazing,etc. words aren't enough to explain. My mom loves this place the most during our visit in Mexico. I recommend you to take the tour. It's something to do once in a lifetime. The experience in the cave made all other imperfection minor and negligible. We ended up buying the photos too. The only complaint is that the size/pixel of the photos should be bigger, given the price we paid. However, most of the photos are less than 500KB.. some are even less than 200 KB."

As we were descending into the cave, I looked over at the Mayan man who had done our ceremony and he was smiling and he gave me a little wave. For me, it was a special moment between two people from completely different cultures. I particularly enjoyed the colors of the cave....the translucent greens and aqua colors of the water were so tranquil. When the river gets deep, you float through the cave.

We arrived to R\u00edo Secreto, and we waited a little for a ride on a Van with other assistants, once we were drove 15-20 min aprox. through a beautiful raw road in the middle of the wild nature, with our guide Angel Guerra we were explained step by step what to do, always with great attitude :) and knowledge. They ask you to get a shower before going into the cave to avoid pollution from the 'outside' world into this marvelous 'almost virgin' place. Through all the tour, Angel was explaining to us with a mix of mayan culture, mysticism, science, etc... We were blessed by an elder Mayan Man with Inciense. They always make you feel great and welcomed into this natural, cultural... sanctuary. Once inside the cave, Angel was always careful with us, telling where and how to walk, always very patient where the most complicated areas, talking and explaining beautifully and answering to all our questions. The place has complicated areas where is tough to bring your own camera, and the idea is to preserve the cave and water as clean and uncontaminated from outside oils as possible.The photos taken by R\u00edo Secreto photographer are amazing and very professionally taken, they use special flashes and lights that are spread around as the place is 100% dark. The food was amazing, very fresh and light. Nothing to spicy, and traditional from Quintana Roo. Like Tamales of Chaya :) they were yumylicious. It was an amazing experience, they have 3 different routs and maybe they will be opening more. Try not to wear oils, creams on the hair or on the skin... besides sun screen. Anyway you'll have to wash yourself. Later you can put it again after you go out from the cave.I'd do the tour again no doubt, my sincere thanks and congratulations to Angel who made this beautiful experience into a lifetime memory."

The guide Jovana was very knowledgable and proud to share her \"office\" with us. They provided helmets with lights, wetsuits and booties. There is some walking in the caves, and there is swimming also. At the beginning of the tour Jovana asked if anyone had any injuries or back, knee or hip issues. My knee had been bothering me and they offered a walking stick which came in very handy. Jovana also had me follow her and she assisted me with some of the stair step type maneuvers. The cave was spectacular with many stalactites and stalagmites. Jovana explained many things about the cave. There are photo opportunities for the photographers to take pictures. I am personally glad that they did not allow outside cameras because it would have been very distracting to have many flashes going off in the caves. So yes, if you want photos, you must purchase them, however, you can make the call if you want to spend the money or not - we chose not to.We would highly recommend this activity - it took about 3 hours total. They did provide a nice buffet with various types of food after the tour. We considered it appetizers and then had a light dinner later.We would do it again and tell them we want to see the other cave."

            "review": "Really fun and informative experience!. I visited the Rio Secreto with my family in July and we had a great time! The caves are SO incredible with giant stalagtites and stalagmites everywhere, and it is a very unique tourist activity. Our guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. We enjoyed the simple lunch after our journey as well. I really loved that they had the photographer along to get some high-quality photos in the dark environment underground.A few negatives: for all of the picture taking they did, they did not take the time to make sure that the wet suits my sister and I had even fit us... and in turn, we ended up with oversized wetsuits and a bunch of very unflattering pictures. Make sure to ASK to get a wetsuit that fits well.Also, I accidentally left my bikini there in the changing room, and upon realizing this, had our hotel call them to try to get it back. There was no response. Even once I have gotten home to the USA, they have not returned an email yet trying to let me know if it was ever located. DO NOT FORGET YOUR STUFF! Otherwise it appears you will never get it back... Overall though, a really fantastic experience, and a must-do activity for the Playa del Carmen area! :)"

            "review": "Very nice... not outstanding!. I went to Rio Secreto after Reading that they had won the best \"green\" tour operator in Mexico for 3 years in a row.. did the reservation (limited numbers of people can go in) on the phone and showed up 25 minutes prior to the beginning of the tour.. Hosts took over 15 minutes to get everything organized, only to know that we had to take a ride in a van for another 10-15minutes with sooo many bumps, into the middle of nowhere... got there, and were received by the tour guides who seemed sort of in a rush, asking you for this and that and rushing you... we got all the gear and we finally went inside. I agree with other reviewers that the guide in front of you is walking very fast, and since he tells you every 2 seconds t watch your step, it is very few what you see while you're walking. The idea is to admire nature at its best, but the guide will keep walking and only stop in certain areas... not quite what you're expecting when you're paying for a tour..you spend more time looking at where your next step will be rather than the amazing stalactites and stalagmites there are inside the cave... We encountered 2 other groups while doing our tour, and the guide explains there are other routes, that \"you can do when you come back\", (leaves you sort of ... ???) Some tips: take your own water shoes if you have them, much comfy that the ugly smelly ones they give out. Bring a waterproof battery torch if you have one..the ones adapted on the helmet cannot really light up with a ceiling 12ft above... you cannot bring any cameras inside, don't even bother... prices are ridiculously high for the pictures taken by the photographer... muchmore expensive than other better places like this in the area... food aftger the tour is very good!, however, then they rush you back to the main entrance... we left after 4 hours of arrving there!"

If you can manage to get a large group together then the tour will go farther. There are places along the tour that they stop to take photos of each group, there were 7 in our family and then a family of three, so there were only 2 pictures to take so it went fast and the guide was able to take us deeper into the cave. Also the grounds around the cave were very pretty and well maintained. The Lunch was spectacular and authentic. Rice, Beans, veggies, potatoes, Taquitos, and wonderful tropical tea. I also really appreciated the Mayan Cleansing Ceremony that they performed before entering the cave! This is a must see for education, adventure, and outright fun!"

I don't know why we had to hurry so much when walking though the caves - footing was very uneven and we had to watch the patch carefully and constantly - thus not appreciating the walk at all. The shoes were too big (BRING YOUR OWN) and kept twisting and slipping which added a lot to the difficulty of negotiating the path at any speed. Both my daughter and I injured ourselves duing this tour. Some parts were EXQUISITE and really make up for the rest. The visit was interesting and lasted what, an hour? The food at the end was not exciting or even enticing. We spent $99US per person for this tour. Would I recommend it? Not sure. I enjoyed a Cenote tour last Fall and it was better. This is different but we felt it was very overpriced."

We had our 11 year old son with us and Rodrigo was wonderful to him. So friendly. The food that we were served after the tour was the best food we had on our vacation. Nothing like a good meal and a few cold beers after a long, bouncy, jungle ride and cave tour. Yes...the drive to the cave location is super bouncy and long. You go into the middle of nowhere, but it was fun. I would suggest this tour for anyone who is not afraid of water and walking through the jungle in their swimsuit in front of everyone."

The cave was so calming, it's an escape from the world above, it's almost like being in one of those deprivation tanks except when you turn the lights on you see the beautful cave formations. Tour guide was very insightful. My only issue is the transportation from the entrance to the cave site was very bumpy and took approximately 15-20 minutes, so if you get car sick I would not suggest you do this activity. It's so bumpy they should make this an ATV route, the shuttle driver tries his best to avoid the bumps but its nearly impossible."

Seriously, you don't have to look up any other excursion because this one is the one for you if you are able bodied. I haven't been on as many cruises as most. I've only been on 4 but I have been to quite a few Central American and Caribbean ports. This excursion has to be the best one I've ever been on. The beauty of the caves and the water and the passion the tour guides (Alfredo) had for what he did was incredible. We were debating between going to the Ruins and this and we DO NOT regret our choice. First they take you and suit you in a wet suit, life jacket, hard hat and swimming shoes and then he takes you into the cave. You walk together, and your tour guide tells you the history and science behind the formation of the cave. The water starts at your ankles and in some areas above your head.It's beautiful and peaceful in there and we had SO much fun. It's a amazing experience and this is the only excursion I've ever done that I would do again. Anyone, who didn't give this a 5 star doesn't know what they are talking about. I'd give this 10 stars if it was applicable."

The caves really speak for themselves with their beauty. The pictures taken are great and so is the price. I loved having a photographer follow us and capture the whole journey. I will be back to do one of the other two cave packages (did suprema). The meal they serve after is a perfect way to end your visit.

This was our 9th cruise, and we do excursions everywhere we go, but this was by far the most amazing excursion we\u2019ve ever taken to date! It was simply thrilling\u2026 Our guide, Dante was brilliant. We learned so much, and will never forget that day. It was very intense and much more than we had expected from the benign Carnival description. We felt like we were filming a National Geographic episode\u2026 and the cruise ship definitely didn\u2019t describe how amazing this excursion would be\u2026 we have 2 kids, ages 11 and 7, and we were all awestruck from this experience. Dante taught/showed us so much about the biodiversity of life in the caves, and about the history of the Mayan explorers that has been evidenced down there. We saw a blind fish and other amazing sights that you would never have an opportunity to come across in day to day living. While hiking back to the lockers, a huge tarantula literally walked across our path, and a beautiful pea-greenparrot was sitting in the trees above our heads. The cave-exploring was definitely more arduous than we had expected (the swimming portion at least), which was great after over-indulging ourselves at every meal on the cruise ship, and Rio Secreto provided us with a lunch (which the cruise ship had not told us about either). Over all, this was simply a perfectly unforgettable adventure, and my family loved every second of it. We bought the pictures (be forewarned that they don\u2019t take AMEX), and will treasure them as reminders of a truly fantastic and unforgettable experience."

A 25 minute ferry ride (can be rough so if you get motion sickness, do plan for that ahead) to Playa del Carmen and we met with our guide to the Rio Secreto, Tomas. He was very friendly to our group (8 total) and made sure we got back to the ferry on time in the afternoon. Tomas and a driver brought us to the Rio Secreto about 20 minutes from the ferry dock. I will tell you that the dirt road into the reserve is rough and has many potholes, but the driver does his best not to make it too rough. once at the main part of the reserve, we met our underground guide, Jean-Paul. He was also great. He fitted all of us with water shoes, wet suits, and life jackets, and after an introduction about the underground river (how it was accidentally found) and the surrounding jungle, we were off. We walked a short 10 minute hike into the jungle where we met with a Mayan priest. He blessed us and protected us from the Mayan Gods before we went in the caves. There are no words to really describe what we had the privilege of seeing. Beautiful stalagmites and stalactites of different colors, along with coral (on the roof of the cave) that was once under the ocean. At one point we stopped and just sat in a circle, turned out our headlamps, and listened to the sounds of the water and the cave. Jean-Paul was very knowledgeable about all points and stops during our underground tour. He also told us where to walk and what not to touch, how to swim, etc. The swim in the river is not too tough and everyone helps each other out up and down the climbs and drops. I was a little apprehensive about the swimming part, but a simple dog paddle is all that was needed. After an hour and a half in the cave we were back above ground. We were served a nice lunch of different flavored waters, soup, tacos, tamales, rice, fruit, etc. That was delicious and the whole group enjoyed the meal together at one table. There are also photos of your adventure underground available for purchase. We purchased all the photos on a CD ($70 US) so we could show our family all we were able to see. There are also single prints for purchase if you desire. If you ever get the chance, you should experience this. It is dark, and at times it does become tight quarters, but if you can handle that and are in reasonably good shape, you should be good to go. We agree with the other reviews in saying that it was very organized, friendly, and professional from beginning to end. Not just any cave, but a fragile, living, breathing eco-system. An amazing, breathtaking tour that we are so glad we did and we will never forget."

The tour called for a hike through a cave with obstacles that requires some team effort, some swimming and picture taking. It wasn't utterly challenging, but it's definitely an experience. I was a bit apprehensive at first in reading some of the reviews that complained about the picture taking, but after realizing that normal point and shoot travel cameras can't capture pictures as accurately - due to darkness and the terrain (i.e. can slip or hurt yourself while navigating and taking pictures), i think having a professional photographer there added to enjoying and sharing the experience with friends and family. Our tour guide, Lia, was great and helped ease my girlfriend's nerves as she couldn't swim... I had to do a lot of negotiating and even had to compromise sitting through a 50 minute spa treatment with her, so I could drag her to come. But in the end, she definitely enjoyed the experience and was happy that she came along.The tour provides water shoes, wet suit, life vest, and helmet with a light, so all you need is to bring a bathing suit. And the tamales during lunch were also great. The bus ride on route is a bit bumpy, but i think they fixed the AC problem as the buses we took all had AC, which wasn't bad at all.This excursion is definitely a to-do on your vacation list!"

            "review": "Life changing and breathtaking experience!. The last time I was in this area (about 8 years ago) Rio Secreto had not even been discovered- and what an amazing discovery it is! This is an opportunity to explore hidden underground caves, and swim an underground river with millions of breathtakingly beautiful stalagtite/stalagmite rock formations and crystal clear water. It was kind of an impulse decision for us to go, but it turned out to be both a spiritual and family bonding experience we would not have missed for anything. What an opportunity we have been given- to see a place like this!That said, this excursion is not for everyone. Use your good judgement here- if you are elderly, or overweight, not in decent shape, or have trouble walking or any other sort of infirmity, you should really pass on this- you will most likely have a hard time, and it's not fair for the guides or the other people on the trip.We didn't know what to expect at all, so I will try to give a good description. First, yes it is a little expensive, but understand this is NOT Xel-ha, where they can run thousands of people thru per day. This company is very sensitive to keeping the ecological balance, and showing proper respect to the site- and part of this is having small groups that are carefully guided through. It's pretty small guide to group ratio- as it should be. The tour has to remain financially viable for those that run it, if people want to continue to have access to this amazing place. And that is what you are paying for, so keep that in mind before you complain about the price. It most certainly is NOT a tourist trap.When you first get there, you board a van that goes 7 km thru a kinda crazy bumpy road into the jungle. You get tossed around a bit, and the vans are understandably torn up. I do think it would make sense for them in the long run to invest in vehicles with sturdier tires and suspensions, for the longevity of the vehicles and visitors' comfort.Once you arrive, you get a short presentation to let you know the basic rules and what to expect. Then you get a locker and they provide you with helmet, lifevest, watershoes, and wetsuit. The wetsuit can be a little bulky but I recommend wearing it, if you are sensitive to the cold. It is not terribly cold at all, but I was happy to have the suit. You are in a group of about 12-15 people and assigned a guide. Our guide was Jovana, and she was great- personable, very knowledgeable and made sure each person in the group was doing okay.You take a short hike through the jungle and arrive at the entry spot where you take part in a Mayan blessing with a priest. I felt this was a considerate thing to do, and showed respect for this sacred site- they are clearly not just trying to rush big groups through here.The first part of the trip through the caves was probably the toughest, as you are having to navigate over lots of rock formations, and it can be slippery in spots and hard to see where you are stepping or how deep the water is, in the spots where you walk thru shallow water. It's especially tricky because you are not supposed to touch the rock formations or you will permanently harm them. Makes it hard to balance though. It's a beautiful walk though, and our guide provided good instruction as well as lots of interesting information.Then comes the really magic part- you get into the deeper water portion and swim through the caves. It's a leisurely pace, with plenty of time to take everything in and enjoy and absorb it. We never thought we would ever have the chance to ever see anything like this- it is an incredible opportunity and one that really should not be missed- I would pick this over almost any other excursion offered. We have a 12 and 14 year old, and both did fine physically and were amazed at the beauty of the site. You really work as a team with the other people- helping each other across each obstacle, and keeping together in a line as you move thru the caverns. It is a wonderful experience.After you emerge, there's another short hike back, and they serve you lunch, after a toast with a Mayan liqueur. Believe me you will be hungry! We found the traditional Mayan Lunch to be very delicious. Once you finish you can lounge in hammocks until the transport is ready to take you back.My one complaint: the photo set up. I know part of the reason they do this is to maintain the financial viability of this, but the prices are truly ridiculous. If they were sensible, I think they'd find they would sell many, many more pictures. I'm sorry, but $25 for one picture is way too much. If the photos were $15 I probably would have bought 2 or 3! And if they were thinking through how they do the digital pictures, they could sell those to people for $5-8 apiece and just give them a code so they could log in and download the pictures when they got home. It would eliminate the need for CDs, and the only costs on their end would be server space and the photographers. And people would be able to afford a souvenir of their visit. I was really disappointed that after such a magical experience for my family we had no photos. But after spending over $350 for all 4 of us to go, we just didn't feel good about putting out $25 for one picture, and couldn't afford $69 for the disc- nor we're we inclined to have to safely get a CD all the way home.That aside, this is an opportunity of a lifetime, that I am so grateful we were able to experience. High praise to the company for their care and respect of the site, and for having such a friendly, thoughtful and able bodied staff. We came out truly feeling that we had taken a spiritual journey. If you are in the Mayan Riviera area, don't miss the chance to do this!"

The views of the cavern are breathtaking and the professional pictures they take are well worth the money. After arriving to the site, you will meet your guide (ours was Alfredo), and take a 10 minute bus ride to the cave site. There, a shaman will bless you as you enter the Mayan \"underworld\", then you basically walk right down to a huge hole in the ground and descend into an awe-inspiring landscape of crystal clear water, millions of stalactites/mites, and even a few bats. You will walk, wade, and swim through the caves for about an hour and a half, as your guide teaches you about the caves and rock formations, and your other guide takes beautiful photos of your experience. After you exit the caves you will be treated to a small mexican lunch buffet and are able to lounge around in hammocks as you wait for your pictures to be ready. The guides are very passionate about what they do, our guide Alfredo personally shared with us that he is living his dream and has been exploring cave systems for over a decade. They will go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and safe along the way. The only con: The photos are sort of pricey, but well worth it. We bought a cd with pics of us and the caves, got two teeshirts, and a bottle of Mexican liquor for $99USD. After seeing our pictures all of our friends are jealous that we got to experience this. Overall, if you are looking for an excursion in the Riviera Maya, this is definitely the most exciting. You must see it to believe it! You wont regret it, and will never forget it."

A short walk through the jungle too, us to the entrance to the cave/aquifer complex. The formations were amazing! The water was cool and clean.

They are still exploring them- sooo extensive--and plan to open another section in October of 2012. I was speechless. So beautiful. Not ruined by commercialism but maintained in its natural state. And the guides insure it by expressing the importance of not touching everything. You walk through, wade through, and swim through the caverns, admiring the stalagtites and stalagmites in all of their hatural beauty (and some of the negotiation between them is tight but so cool). We had a fantastic guide, Mauricio, whose enthusiasm and knowledge was infectious. They have a few areas where you can stop to take photos, and their photographer will take them. You have the option to buy all of the photos or pick and choose. The cd with all pix was only $69 and totally worth it I think for memories like this--I mean, seriously, this is not something you can do anywhere, in fact, I imagine it is a 1 of a kind experience. I would recommend it for all ages- our group ranged from 25-68, I even saw other groups with 5 year olds! They provide you with shoes, a wetsuit, a life vest, and a helmet, as well as optional walking sticks, which even I opted for to help feel my way around the rocks--very helpful! Lunch was terrific- traditional authentic mexican fare, and as a vegetarian there was a great deal for even me to choose from. The entire excursion lasted about 6 hours. The only 'not so fun' thing was the drive from the welcome are to the site itself. The roads are far from smooth and the bumps are unbelievable! The entire rear portion of the van slides wildly left to right as the driver tries to avoid the 'bigger' bumps! It felt like driving on ice with giant holes. A rather unpleasant 20 min ride. I imagine in time they may be able to pave these roads, if funds allow for it. Regardless, the ride is negligible when compared to this truly amazing experience! I can't wait to go back!"

            "review": "A Must!!. This is an absolute must for anyone able to do it. This is a truly magical experience. Rio Secreto was only discovered in 2006, so this is a vastly unexplored underground cave. It is located on a very large property that is pretty untouched as far as development, there is a welcome area, a small shop and bathroom facilities. There is also a small sitting area where you wait for your ride to the cave entrance. You can purchase native juices or other treats at the small store/coffee shop. Once you take a ten minute ride in their van to the cave entrance, you are assigned a locker (you keep the key until you return), more bath and shower areas and changing areas. They provide wetsuits, watershoes, lifevests and a helmet with a light to help you view the wonders of the cave. After a brief history of the cave and the Mayan culture that was present in that area, you take a short walk to a Mayan Shaman, who blesses you after you 'ask permission' of the gods to enter the sacrad place now called Rio Secreto. You then climb down into the mouth of the cave and then the story begins of its history as well as safety measures. After that, you begin to walk through the cave and water. The water is strangely white, from the calcium and other minerals. We were lucky enough to see the 'white blind fish' that only sometimes appear during tours. Also, the water was pleasantly cool, not cold, cool. You are not allowed to touch anything on the inside of the cave because the oils of our hands can corrode the minerals. They do offer walking sticks if you have trouble with balance. There is a place where you have to swim, so if you're not a good swimmer, they won't allow you to go inside. There is a photographer that follows you throughout the cave and takes plenty of pictures of you and your group so you have lots to choose from. You have options to purchase a CD of pictures, shirts and even a liquor that they produce from some of the native plants. The more people are in your group, the longer the tour takes. With four people the tour took us about two hours. I beleive the limit of people is ten, so that of course would at least double the time. Everyone was very friendly and if you are looking for an english speaking tour guide I highly recommend Benito. He was friendly, very knowledgeable and very fun."

After much consideration we chose Rio Secreto for our cruise expedition, the reviews were good and we hoped to experience something unique as well as educational. We were not disappointed, the trip began with a ferry ride, approx 35 minutes, smooth water that day but we've been told it can get quite rough so take some dramamine if you're prone to motion sickness. We were then greeted enthusiastically by our guide and escorted to a \"semi\" airconditioned van. The van travels through the city and then takes you down a roller coaster of a dirt road which winds through the jungle and ends at the little village of Rio Secreto. You then divide into groups of approx 10, change into bathing suits and/or wet suits if you like, shower to remove all oils and chemicals from your body to protect the river and lock your belongings in a locker. You're guide will provide you with a life vest, water shoes and a lighted hard hat. As you head toward the river on foot your next stop is the Mayan Shaman who provides a blessing, the Rio Secreto is considered a hallowed place which requires your body and mind to be cleansed before you may enter. Our guide Alfredo was both informative and genuine in his love for the caves. A twenty year veteran of cave exploration, Alfredo was respectful and grateful for the opportunity to work in such spectacular natural wonder. You then enter the caves and the journey begins. There is nothing commercial about this tour, you will make your way through the caves step by step, feeling your way \"with confidence\" says Alfredo. It would be easy to slip and fall so take it slow and don't try this if you've had recent knee surgery or back problems. There is a photographer following you at all times snapping pictures which can be purchased at the end of the trip. The river winds and bends, offering a multitude of opportunities to appreciate the underground wonders of Rio Secreto, stalagtites, stalagmites, natural formations, sink holes, underground pools and a moment of the most complete darkness and silence as you wade, shuffle and swim through approx 1 1/2 hours of exploration. Alfredo kept a close eye on the group offering a helping hand when needed as well as encouraging questions as he taught us about his beloved caves. At the end of the tour we returned to our lockers, offered iced tea or a sample of a homemade Mexican liqueur then treated to a delicious Mexican lunch of tortillas and salad, beer and soda are offered at a reasonable price if desired. We were then left to rest for a bit in a garden area complete with hammocks and rustic chairs until the van returned for the ride home. A complete CD of your pictures is available for $69, you can also purchase a Tshirt as part of a package. Per our guide the property above Rio Secreto belongs to the owner who discovered the entrance to the caves six years ago. Mexican law claims all underground property and the caves are considered a national treasure. We loved this trip and considered it a privilige to be allowed to participate in what has to be one of the most beautiful places on earth. Thanks again Alfredo! A trip we'll never forget."

We went to Rio Secreto on the spur of the moment, met up with the rest of our group at a large palapa where they also had a coffee shop, cold wet paper towels to cool off, pretty lawn chairs and gardens. After a brief presentation, we embarked on probably the bumpiest ride I've ever been on to the cenote. We had lockers and took showers before getting in wetsuits and hard hats. Our tour guide was Benito, he was very informative about the formations (we had been snorkeling at Hidden Worlds and it was nowhere near as decorated). He told us about the water minerals and how it forms different shapes and colors as it drips through the limestone. Your hands are really soft after you've been in this water awhile and it is a fairly long tour. Benito could tell I was the clumsy one so I made sure to stay close to him, it is hard to get your footing because you want to look all around you. They do take photos of you that are beautifully set and lit-they take the lighting out after the last tour. Danny was our photographer-he would really try to make sure the photos were good. The photos were way too expensive though. $69 is as much as the tour. I would have liked to have photos, but couldn't justify the cost. We were lucky enough to see the blind fish, cave spiders, bats, and a muk muk (bright blue) bird. The moment of silence so far underground in the large cavern was a great experience as was being blessed by the Mayan shaman before entering the cave. It was just as incredible all throughout the cave as the entrance going down the stairs and climbing out into the sunshine at the end. We tried some anise liquor and had a vegetarian lunch, use the yellow dressing on the salas, empanadas, and plaintains were good. We tried the chala drink, very \"healthy\" tasting. We highly recommend this, especially if you've never been floating in a cenote before, this is the one to see!"

            "review": "AMAZING!. My boyfriend and I visited Rio Secreto in May 2012, as an excursion on a Caribbean cruise. The entire trip was absolutely amazing! Be sure to follow the directions to prepare yourself: they make you rinse off under a shower prior to going into the caverns. It helps to preserve the natural state of the water and structures. Had I truly known, I would not have lathered with sunscreen and other lotions, hairsprays etc before leaving the ship! The tour itself is incredible. The caverns are breathtaking, and words truly can not describe them! They provide you with lockers, as you are not allowed to bring ANYTHING into the caverns (no hats, sun glasses, watches, camera etc). They provide wet suits and water shoes, however we were able to use our own water shoes. There are facilities for bathroom and changing purposes. Our guide was amazing (they deserve their tips!). It is obvious that the guides truly honor the privilege of being allowed in the caverns, as they consistently promote nature preservation. The food afterward was also phenomenal! You will not leave hungry! Although, be sure to bring cash for purchasing carbonated beverages (there is beer for purchase!) and also for purchasing pictures. The picture is worth the $$!! I can't say enough positive words about the experience."

            "review": "A Must Do!!. Went with several girlfriends on this excursion in July 2012. This is definitely a must do on your list if you are in Cancun/Playa area. The fee is very reasonable for what you get and it's pretty much all inclusive except getting to/from original check in point. You check in one area, then there is a van that takes on you on a 10/15 min bumpy ride to the actual location right where the cave is. You change into a wetsuit and life jacket and water shoes, you are also given a locker for your personal belongings. Our guide was amazing (forgot his name, thin gentleman), however he was just so knowledgeable and so passionate about the nature and history of the cave. The caves were one of the coolest things I have ever seen. There were a couple parts where you do have to swim there (no fear for non swimmers as the life jacket keeps you afloat while you paddle). Rio Secreto is something you will not see anywhere else.Also the neat thing about the excursion is there is a professional photographer who accompanies the group. At the end there are a couple options to purchase. A disk full of the photos is about $69 USD, not bad. After the tour of the cave, a small simple Mexican lunch is included which is a nice surprise. It's nothing fancy so don't expect a whole lot. Overall, I agree with other reviewers, this was one of the best excursions!"

No chance of that.Our guide was Lia who was fantastic. The cave system just has to be seen to be believed. There was ten of us in the group, 3 couples and our family of four. I'm not sure who enjoyed it the most, the kids with their eyes wide at every new marvel, or the adults with their eyes wide at every turn of the cave...The DVD they offer at the end is very well worth the extra cost, the pictures they took of our family were absolutely perfect.If you have the time, we highly recommend this tour."

            "review": "Amazing Secret River. All I can say is do not miss this tour. The Amazing Secret River excursion booked thru Carnival Cruise lines is by far the best tour that I have ever booked. Our tour guide Mauricio was very informative and friendly as was everyone associated with the tour. We were picked up at the dock and went to the cave by van. We then rinsed off under a shower to get all the oils off our skin before entering the cave. We were given water shoes, wet suits, life vests and helmets with a light attached. We were divided into groups of 8-10 with each group having their own guide. The groups were spaced out so that the tour was very personal and you felt like your small group was the only one in the cave. There was also a discrete photographer that followed each group to take pictures as you were not permitted to take a camera with you. Part of it was shallow and was more like hiking and part of it we had to swim. The entire cave was beautiful and breathtaking. You were told to try to not touch anything because the oil from your skin would be damaging. They offer walking sticks to increase your stability. Our family was a group of 8 ranging in age from 17 to 79 and was enjoyed by all. The 79 year old was also assisted and helped by our guide when needed. There are parts of the cave where there is not much clearance between the water level and the roof of the cave ~ just enough for your head and helmet to pass thru. The tour was truly AMAZING! I also enjoyed the lunch after the tour that was also included. I thought the CD for purchase that included over 60 pictures that were taken by the photographer was also very reasonable. They had different packages for purchase. I believe we paid $90 for the package containing the CD of over 60 pictures (which were AMAZING) and 3 shirts in whatever sizes we wanted. (I think the CD on it's own was $60) When you consider that the pictures taken on the cruise ship run anywhere from $10 to $20 and above for ONE picture ~ I think the price was very reasonable in comparison. Yes, if you were permitted to take your own camera you could take pictures for free, but I don't think you would be able to get the same shots and you would be missing half the tour trying to get your shots. It's worth it to buy the pictures of this experience. I can not recommend this tour enough! :)"

You are asked rinse off to keep the water as untainted as possible ( in case you have lotions or sunscreen on your skin). We were able to store our clothes and cameras in lockers (no cameras allowed in the cave) that were provided. We were given wet suits, life vests, water shoes and helmets with headlamps. We then had a short walk to the entrance during which we discussed the Mayan rituals, safety, etc. This activity is not difficult but it is challenging to walk through rough, bumpy cave paths, often in water unable to see your feet or touch the cave walls. The water was deep in a few areas and a little swimming was necessary. The whole cave experience took approx 90 min. There was a buffet lunch that was just OK. Our guide was Alfredo and he was enthusiastic, knowledgeable and engaging. This was an enlightening and incredibly beautiful experience. This was a reminder to take care of our planet and water system. I would definitely do this again the next time I come to Cancun! It was disappointing not to be able to take pictures. I did not think that the DVD was worth the price."

This is a hike through a pristine cave discovered within the last 6-7 years. We were driven to the site 40 min from the dock in a van. Then we were asked to rinse off our sunscreen and chemicals to keep the water as untainted as possible. We were able to store our clothes and cameras in lockers (no cameras in the cave). We were given wet suits to use and offered water shoes (you can bring your own), and given helmets with headlamps. We then had a quick hike to the entrance during which we discussed the cave's discovery, Mayan rituals, safety, etc. Although the activity is not difficult, it is challenging to walk through rough, bumpy cave paths, often in water unable to see your feet. At a couple points the water was deep and a little swimming was needed (in life vests too). Someone here recommended taking the offered walking stick, and I would agree with that in hindsight. After the 1-2 hour cave experience there was a buffet of locally produced native cuisine that was delicious. Our guide was Jean Paul and he was spectacular-patient, knowledgeable, and engaging. This was an interesting and incredibly beautiful experience."

They have kept the caverns as natural as possible, with no improved paths or anything, something I have never seen. So you have to really clamber, wade, swim your way through. More of an untouched cave experience than any commercial cavern I have been to. The guide was excellent, explaining a lot abou the caverns, how it was formed, how the various formations came about (I have a geology degree, and he got it all right). They only let a limited number, about 90, people in each day, in groups of about 10. They serve a fabulous lunch buffet when you come out of the cave. Our group had 4 teens and 1 young girls and they loved it, as did the 6 adults. They also take fantastic pictures of each group and individuals during the tour that are worth buying at the end.It is a pretty long ride out from town, nearly an hour, but worth it."

It is quite an experince, amazing how nature build its own Art and compared to other places in Cancun, Rio Secreto tries to keep it as natural and spiritual as it is. It is a 3 hour tour (about 2 hours in the caves the other hour is transportation, food, and change of clothes). Our Tour Guide was wonderful on explaining everything and being patient and carefull with us. At the end of the tour you get also a very good buffet style lunch with authentic mayan food. I recommend this to anybody looking for unique way to see the \"underworld\" of the Mayans, and for all of those that wonder if its scary down there, I can tell you that I am a nervous person and I never felt claustrophobic or in danger."

However, after reviewing the pictures and reading some reviews online, I was intrigued.They picked us up from our hotel. We arrived and had to take another bus to get closer to the caves. It was the bumpiest ride ever on a dirt road. We should have been on a Jeep/Hummer or even a horse would have been better to ride.I was scared but I am definitely glad I did it. I'm also a germaphobe so I was nervous about the wetsuit thing but it was no big deal... I didn't try to smell it though... LOL. You put it on wet and wear your bathing suit underneath. Note the wetsuit is however optional but I recommend it as it provides some padding in case you rub against a rock or something, which is inevitable. Hard hats with lights and a life vest is mandatory and provided for you.Bring your own water shoes cuz using old wet shoes is especially nasty. In case you don't have your own, they have water shoes you can borrow. I was about to wear my Teva close toed sandals but I don't think those would have flied... I wore my Speedo water shoes instead and our tour guide checked the bottom of my soles. I think they want the soles to be pretty smooth so you don't disturb the area too much. Please note that it is pretty uneven terrain on the short hike before you even get to the caves... like if you aren't careful, you could twist your ankle. In the caves it's kind of more treacherous as you can't see the floor through to the bottom so you don't know what kind of terrain is underneath.They require you shower off beforehand but no one explained why until we were already in the caves. I barely made an effort to shower cuz I wanted to keep my sunblock/repellent on. Our tour guide showed us that even the natural oil of our bodies disturbed the natural balance of the water in the caves... she touched her face and then touched the water and the calcium carbonate layer on the top of the water spread apart from where the contact was! Please rinse off well and don't bother with sun block since you won't need it underground. The views are spectacular and unreal. Our tour guide's name I think was Adriana. She was very knowledgeable but sometimes it was difficult to understand her English. I can't really swim well. Make sure you tell your guides if that is the case for you. She let me walk in front of the rest of the group so I could be directly behind her so she could help me. During parts where you have swim, she let me hold on the strap behind her vest and just pulled me in the water. You aren't like hella swimming at any point... you have to paddle your arms underneath the water to minimize waves disturbing the area. At some points I was just floating in my vest and paddling through the water by myself. Note the swimming is minimal as you never submerge your head under the water. Sometimes the ceiling was less than 2-3 feet from our heads so it was a crazy experience.No cameras allowed. They sell you pics on a CD at the end. Too expensive. We only bought one for $25 USD.Stay single file in the caves and watch where the person ahead of you steps and try to follow. Point your lights to the ground where you walk. They have waterproof cases for your inhaler if you're asthmatic. I didn't even bring my inhaler but luckily no attacks for me. Air was cooler in the caves.Small buffett lunch served afterwards. Lockers provided beforehand."

We thought we were doomed when the kids started complaining about putting on the wetsuits even before we got into the cave. Our tour guide, Mauricio, was great with the kids. Once we got into the caves we were all spellbound. The cave was wide open and lit by or helmets so none of us ever felt claustrophobic, which had been a concern. Our guide showed us all kinds of cool stuff and swimming in the cave was really amazing. Afterwards we asked everyone to rank the experience and all five of us gave it a 10, adults and kids alike. Getting the kids to agree on anything without bickering is a feat, so the fact that we all agreed says something. It was the best excursion we have been on in any vacation, ever. I ended up with poison ivy from the walk to the cave-- the guide warned us but be careful!"

We had not heard of this tour before we boarded the ship but we saw that this was only tour that was sold out prior to departing Port Canaveral. Just seeing that, we HAD to see what this was all about and we went on a waiting list for an opening. To our surprise, two spots opened up later that evening and our tour advisor insisted we don't pass up this opportunity to visit the Secret River. I'm so glad we were able to expeince this. No pamphlet, review site, tour guide, r website comes close to accurately portraying what lies beneath the surface deep into where you will venture. Shortly after a native blessing ceremony, which I now see why they do after what our journey entailed, we descended deep into the caves. Our guide was very detailed and clear as to what was ahead, how we were to walk, when to swim, and made me feel so comfortable in the darkness of the caves. I must say I was shocked a few times during our tour, to the extent at which we were maneuvering through teeny, tiny spaces. At one point we were swimming through the water and were told to submerge ourselves so that only our nose and head be out of the water due to the low cave ceiling literally inches above our helmets. I am terrified of enclosed spaces and I will admit and I never felt uncomfortable or nervous. It was probably better that I didn't know the extent of the small spaces we would be in ahead of time, I may have backed out. But, I am sooooooo glad I did this and we say that we would do it again in a heartbeat when we return on a future cruise. The pictures they offer you are a little pricey but oh so worth it. It's a great memory of where you were and what you saw. You wont find anything else like this in the world. Please take our recommendation and do this tour!"

The tour was amazing, a beautiful natural wonder that is completely worth seeing. The company takes VERY good care of the cenotes. They stress heavily to follow them through completely so less of the cave is damaged, as well as encourage showers before to not pollute the water with sunscreen or other lotions. Our tour guide, Pablo, was a REAL treat. One of the best so far, he spoke English very well, and went through instructions carefully and was very safe through out the tour. As well, he is quite the humorous guy! Absolutely, request him if you can!As well, the food after the visit was quite good too! it's not what you would find at the resorts, but if you are open to trying new things and tasting Mexican food cooked by the people themselves, this is a cultural treat you can't miss out on!Only issue was the pictures were EXTREMELY expensive, but the profits go to nature conservation for the park, so paying $25 USD for one photo was justified,"

It would be a good rainy day choice. Our tour had transportation included and it was 20 minutes late, apparently he had to ask for directions, he also got lost on the way back! The tour itself for well run, and our guide was very helpful. There were just 6 of us on the tour so that was great, we always felt like we were the only ones down there. The walking through the cave was uneven but we never felt rushed and helped each other out. The rocks were sometimes uncomfortable with the thin water shoes. Some of the cave features were spectacular. I enjoyed the swimming part of the tour, and felt there could have been more of that. I also liked when we turned off our lights and floated in complete darkness, it was freaky! At the end of the tour we all had a shot of a Mayan liquer, it was okay if you like black licorice. Then we looked at the pictures (a photo guy is with you, you can't bring cameras with). We were planning on buying the photo cd, $69, and it is high priced but single prints were $25. So since we were planning on buying the cd at the start we posed well for pics. There is another package for around $90 that included the cd, 2 tee shirts, and a bottle of the mayan liquor. AFter that we got back into our normal clothes. It was a little gross using the shoes and wet suit but I didn't break out into a terible rash. They do provided a locker for you to use, so that was nice. Lunch was provided and it was okay. I would have rather skipped it and went back to the resort. Lunch was really all carbohydrates, no meat provided. And since I'm diabetic, a lunch of all carbs isn't a great idea. The lime soup and the spinach tamales were the best part of the lunch. I wouldn't do the tour again (been there done that), however it was a neat experience. I liked that it didn't last all day, and if it had been raining it would have been a good way to beat the rain. If you have questions please feel free to message me!"

You cannot bring your own camera, a photographer of the organisation will go along, and you will pose in a number of locations. Admission is 69 USD pp, and the photo's are another 60 USD (per group), so quite pricey but worth it!"

Our girls are 11 and 14 and absolutely LOVED this experience. They supply all that you need, the water shoes, helmets, wet suits, life jackets, lockers, and hard hat with light. All of it feels clean. The changing areas and restrooms are clean. We started in Cozumel and the excursion company met us the moment we stepped foot off the ship and escorted us the whole way. We took a ferry from Cozumel to Playa Del Carmen. Then they broke us up into groups of 10. From Playa Del Carmen, they supplied transport to the Rio Secreto. The road to Rio Secreto is long and BUMPY. A ride in itself. But once there, you see that this is a top-notch, newer attraction. (I asked and it is only about 4 years old.) The facilities seem newer, but you do not lose the charm of this ancient land. Our guide was Gonzo and met us when the taxi dropped us off and stayed with us until the end. He was excellent with kids. We had a 5 year old in our group and he took special attention to keep an eye on her.Our girls LOVED floating through the underground river. They were never scared. The guide ensures that the group of 10 rotates, so that everyone gets a chance in front and a chance to bring up the rear. A photographer is with you the whole way and takes GREAT pictures. The CD purchase is worth it. We had a lunch served after the walk and we were surprised at all that they had. It was wonderful and very filling.The taxi took us back to Playa Del Carmen where we met our excursion guide. We were given 1 hour to walk around town. The town seems nice and quaint, but we went straight to the beach and had about 45 min. to swim in the BEAUTIFUL ocean before we had to board the water ferry back to Cozumel and the ship.We highly recommend this! The off road ride is quite bumpy and you do have to crouch and duck through some of the walk. You have a life jacket to float through the very SLOW moving part that you cannot touch bottom on. The property is beautiful and we cannot say enough about the staff! A very different Mexican experience and it's in the SHADE the most of the time."

Rio Secreto is totally deep jungle mysterious coupled with being impossibly delicate and surreal. The guides go through great pains to keep the system pure and pristine as well as keeping you safe and relaxed to take it all in. The beauty of it is beyond this review box... trust me when I say it's a rare day out unless your some fearless cave diver or Jacques Cousteau-type. Most swimming levels can do the system but it helps if you're in decent physical shape. You'll bend and climb over rocks a fair bit. Most of it is fairly level but you have to stay alert constantly (I recommend NO hangover). I'd be more worried about people with claustrophobia issues. Some areas are a bit close (there's no squirming to get through places, however). Make sure to leave all sunscreens and make up off before you go. They'll just make you scrub it off (for very good reason) before getting your wetsuit. Water isn't too deep and you'll wish you could spend the whole day down there swimming with its beauty baiting you into wanting to take offshoots deep into the unknown (you can't -- they keep you accounted for at all times). Take in this natural wonder! It's breathtaking!!!"

This place is amazing and the guides (ours was Julio) really care about the environment! The guides take their time explaining everything about the cave system, what you can and can't touch as well as Mayan culture. It truly is like entering another world! It's a slow paced tour of caves, cenotes and underground rivers. There is so much to see that if you went back two or three times, you would see something different each time! Plus, they feed you a very nice lunch after your trip.Everything is included such as water shoes, wetsuit, floation jacket and helmet with light. They do take pictures while you are underground and they are available for purchase afterwards. But they are a bit pricey. Also, there is a 20 minute van ride from the welcome center to the actual cavern entrance. Seriously, the van ride is part of the adventure! It's like driving off road in a full size van. I think we caught some air time when we flew over one of the hills on the road.This really is something to see/do while you're in the area!"

            "review": "BEST CAVE TOUR I HAVE DONE. You cannot image how beautiful an underwater cave is until you see one in person. We recently visited Rio Secreto as an excursion though Carnival Cruise Lines and were blown away by the scenery as well as the experience and care the guides took. Our guide was Adrianna and you could tell very quickly that she not only took her job seriously, she was also VERY knowledgeable. We were fitted in wet suites, helmets and life jackets, then off into the forest we went. We asked permission of the Mayan Gods to allow us in the caves and keep us safe in a ceremony outside of the mouth of the cave. Our group of 9 (small which was nice...lots of individual attention), then headed into the caves. Adrianna and the other guides at Rio Secreto took special care to be sure our passing would be safe for us as well as for the caves, preservation of this special place was defiantly a priority. We spent over an hour wandering though the caves - in and out of water - seeing all sorts of cave formations. There was a photographer on the tour with us (provided by Rio Secreto) who took photos of us along they way. I knew in advance that we could not bring our own camera so I was prepared to spend money on the ones they took...that being said the photos were worth EVERY CENT! ALL of the photos were CRYSTAL clear, with PERFECT lighting and showed a bit of everything, With the personal photo package we also got a bunch of \"stock photos\" of the caves...82 in total for $69!! Having the photos taken for us meant we were free to take everything in, we had both hands for balance (which you need on an uneven cave floor), we did not have to worry about getting good lighting, or holding up the group while we tried to get the perfect shot....it was all done for us. After the tour we were provided with a snack which turned out to be a HUGE lunch with chicken soup, tamales, tacos, rice, beans and home made hot sauce and salsa...YUM!!! All we could say the whole trip was how cool it was and how beautiful the caves were. EVERYONE should experience this amazing place, you really need to see it to believe it!"

            "review": "Amazing, but disappointed. Cost for pictures is ri-donk-ulous.. Amazing, amazing experience, but I was so disappointed at the end. It kinda ruined it for me.Cancun is not cheap. The tacos taste delicious, but I can honestly find better mexican food for 1/2 the price here in LA. For me to spend $$ on something it has to be unique.The good- off the beaten path experience. I have been in caves in Thailand, but did not get to really explore far or have the experience of swimming through it. The guide was very good and it felt like a good amount of time down there (about 1.5 hours). This is like being in national geographic...you would never get to do this in the US.The not so great- the equipment is very smelly. I doubt that these are disinfected after each use. I don't understand the point of issuing wetsuits when they don't even fit. They are so oversized so they don't offer much warmth and rub. The water is surprising cold down there and you're in it about 60% of the time. It had just rained so the water level was high in there. If you have your own water shoes bring them. After this experience I have decided to for sure buy my own b/c the thought of ever wearing shoes that a ton of other people had their bare feet in grosses me out. The BAD- you cannot bring your camera into the cave. They have a photographer that follows the group around. The cost is ridiculous. $25/each for individual shots, $69 for the package. Really I only saw 2 pics that I liked of myself. The others were bad angles and not good. I was prepared for $5-10 each per pic thinking that I would just suck it up to buy 1 just to have the memory, but what they were asking for is not justified. Especially when all they are doing is burning a disk. From what I read on the reviews the resolution is not great so you cannot even make it bigger to print. For $69 you get your handful of individual/group shots and then a bunch of stock photos. Lame. I went to a really great cave in Thailand and the pics on my camera where much better quality than what was offered at Rio Secreto. After paying a high price for admission there should be better deals on pictures. I would rather pay a fee to bring my own camera. I understand that they would really have to limit this as you would miss out on the true cave experience with 6 flashes going off all the time. But I think people would be respectful enough to not take mulitple pics every 5 seconds. Or just have designated picture taking areas only. The meal at the end was just ok. Just eat enough not to passout and wait to eat at your hotel. Don't fill up on all that because the ride back to the main road is 20 minutes of bumps and swerving. Cost- I paid $99 and booked it through my hotel. Don't do that-- Do the research and find a better deal. A guy on my tour paid $75 through another company. Would I do it again- yes, but I would find a better deal. It's a very unique experience, just be ready to pay $$ for the memories. For that price I hope it's the right angle and you're happy with it. Looks like people uploaded some of the stock photos (just pics of the cave, no people) from their trip so I'm just going to lift these for free. Giving it a 4 rating just because it really is a cool site to see. *Not good if you have difficulty moving around (large ppl or older). It is narrow in there and I did incur a couple minor scrapes and bruises. *there are NO ATMS on site (so pull cash before you go for tipping). They only accept visa/mastercard for the pics. **excellent alternative on super rainy days."

The quality of the images are also very poor....too small to enlarge. They should allow tourists to take their own photos.

We walked down into one of the underground river systems, through watter most of the way and swam through the cave system. it was unbelievably beautiful, calming, quiet, and blessedly cool Our guide, Pablo, was a joy. Knowledgable, pleasant and full of the joy of the place. Highly recomended - we sent at least 12 other people there in the last day and a half that we were in Mexico - wonderful! And the meal aftrerwards was marvelous. Folks with knee, back, or ankle trouble should think twice and use the walking stick they have available, as the pace is fast and the footing occasionally treacherous, but the guide points out where to step. Wet suits and flotation devices are provided as are helmets. Swiming ability required is practically nil so long as you can float using the life vest they provide, which anyone can do."

And it really shows in how he discusses the geology of the caverns, the Maya's influence in the area, and the natural aspects of the jungle. The tour in our opinion is an experience that most people can physically do, but be prepared to remain observant and careful throughout. Unfortunately, this tour would probably not occur in the United States because of potential liability. If you love the natural world, don't miss this once in a lifetime tour!"

We were told by Best Day travel that the trip was only 1.15 hours but they did not tell us there was 2 hours of pick ups at other hotels before the 1.15 hour trip even began! We were looking for a 1/2 day trip but it was really a whole day because we got picked up at 8:25 AM and got back at 4:30pm. Not cool!! Also, once you get there, you have another 20 minute ride down a horribly bumpy back road before you reach the river. Then you get bitten by mosquitoes as you walk to the river opening and listen to some old man give you a blessing. Then once you get into the cave, the only light come from th dim headlamps on your hardhats. You begin the tour walking through the dry cavern but the rooms get smaller and smaller as you get deeper, and its HOT! I began to get very claustrophobic knowing there are tons of rocks all around you and no quick way out, with no sign of the outside. At one point, the guide tells everyone to turn off their head lamps for a few minutes of meditation but it was so dark and stifling. After barely fitting through caverns (and I am only 130 lbs), you finally hit the cold water. But then you realize you cant feel the bottom and its just creepy. After 1 hour and 40 minutes, you finally see the light of day and it could not be soon enough! The pictures of the site look like there is light everywhere and wide open places but there is not and I would not ever do it again. I do not recommend this to anyone who would get buggy in an elevator for over 1 hours....thats how I felt."

It was a half day excursion 3-4 hours total, although the location was only 10-15 minutes from our hotel. The roughest part of the whole experience was the bus ride from the entrance to the river, bumpy, bumpy, bumpy, so be sure to grab a seat closest to the front of your bus. :)Once we got there, we were given a great orientation by our tour guide JULIO, who was awesome, very knowledgeable, passionate and funny. The group size is small 8-10 people total who you get to know during the 1.5 hour tour.You are given a locker for your belongings, and only need your bathing suit. You are provided with wet shoes, a wet suit, life vest and a hard hat with a head light. The wet suit is optional, and if you have your own wet shoes you can bring and use those. After a 5 minute walk or so thru the jungle, and a ceremony by a local Mayan guide, for safe travels within the cave, you enter the mouth of cave and begin your tour. It's beautiful, Julio taught us all about the stalagmites and stalagtites, the cave history, and the photographer tooks tons of great photos.The water is refreshingly cool, maybe 70degrees or so, and feels great after being in the wet suit and lifevest, you get a bit stuffy, so the water feels wonderful. Expect to walk, climb mostly, with a few opportunities to actually swim. Overall the experience was incredible, beautiful and we loved it. Your group will enjoy a local home made lunch following your tour, and can purchase any of the pictures taken by the photogrpaher while inside the cave (pricey $25 for 1 was the least expensive option, but totally worth the picture).Enjoy!P.S. I (Michelle) am mildly claustrophobic and only once or twice did this bother me when we had to take a few steps thru small spaces, but since the cave is so big i was good, and the cool water refreshed me as well. For the most part, it was the wet suit and lifevest that smothered me a bit, so I kept them unzipped and unlatched a little, and completely took them off after the cave on our walk back thru the jungle."

It was good to be with other people that we knew because you feel comforted. The place was amazing ... like from an adventure movie but they were 3 things that I didn't like ( and i think this is very personal anyway): I have phobia for spiders and when I asked the guide if there were some of them ( I was already inside) he said that yes and they call it \"crab spider\" because it has its mouse like a crab and they are pretty dangerous). At this point I got so scared I wanted to run away and of course I had it in the back of my mind the whole time). Then they turned the lights off and I freaked out..you couldn't see absolutely anything and I felt spiders coming out from the walls.. Very scary!. . The third thing I didn't like was that they wouldn't allow us to bring cameras and then they wanted to sell us the pictures the photographer took for $70!! Even more than was the whole visit cost! And this was a CD with digital pictures. . My husband wanted so bad those pics and I felt bad but we didn't want to pay for such a ripoff. He loved the experience though, he was so happy like a little kid in an adventure."

These are the things I didn't like:- no cameras are allowed, not even waterproof ones- a Rio Secreto photographer accompanies you to take pictures which you can buy at the end of the tour, but the prices are outrageous. The cheapest package is $60US, but that includes stock photos!! If you want just one photo, it'll cost you $25US!! This is just gouging the tourists. This is after spending $100US/ea to get into the site.- I didn't have enough money on me for the photos, so the staff took my e-mail address and said they would send me a link to download the photos and paypal info, but I'm still waiting for them to contact me- if you get car sick at all, then take Gravol or something to help you. The van ride to the site is 15 minutes of kidney-pounding bumps"

I am a big gal (a bit over 200 lbs) but in fairly good shape. I was concerned that either the wetsuit wouldn't fit or I would have a hard time navigating the caverns, but neither was a problem. Do keep in mind that the walk is long, the footing is VERY uneven and sometimes slippery. This is not for you if you have weak knees or ankles. The excursion is absolutely beautiful! We started out from Cozumel with a 40 minute ferry ride to the mainland.There, Angel made sure our group was accounted for and loaded onto the correct vans, where we were taken on a 25 minute ride to Rio Secreto. Our guide, Alejandro, then outfitted us and took us thru the cavern, explaining many things as we went along. There were only 9 in our group, but I do wish we would have been in the front of the group so our 10 year old would have been able to hear better. This wonderful experience is hard to put into words, so I won't even try. I will say that our favorite part was swimming in the cool water. (My husband and son thought it was a bit cold, but I thought it felt great.) A couple of side notes: 1)if you can't swim or dont want to swim, they will walk you around the water area 2.)if you have trouble with balance, take the walking stick they offer you. I felt much more confident with my footing while using the stick. After the tour, our guide took us back to change clothes and eat. Now, on the Carnival shore excursion description, it says you will have a \"snack\"...this is no snack, this is a full on authentic Mexican buffet, and a good one at that! We bought the CD of photos they took and 3 shirts. Alejandro was constantly checking on our group of 9 to make sure we had everything we needed and to make sure we made it on the correct van back to the ferry. He really worked hard to make this a safe and enjoyable tour. Back at the pier, Angel was once again waiting for us as we stepped off the van. These people are serious about making sure you make the ferry back to your cruise ship. Angel and Alejandro were constantly counting us to make sure noone was left behind. We had about 45 minutes of free time to shop or walk along the beach, then back on the ferry directly to the cruise ship terminal. Do this, you won't regret it."

From there, we gathered with other groups, listened to a short introduction with instructions and then headed off in vans to the area where we would get our lockers, and use the changing rooms (there are also bathrooms located here). There is an outdoor shower for everyone to use to rinse off. They are very concerned with the environment and want to protect the caves and water. We were given wet suits, life jackets and helmets for the cave tour. You need to bring your own water shoes and towels. We split into groups of about 8 and met with our guide, Alfredo.  Alfredo was an awesome guide! He was slow enough for everyone in the group and he explained everything so well. He was so enthusiastic about the cave and our experience. The other guides seemed very friendly and helpful, as well. We spoke with lots of people after our tour and everyone loved their guides! After we got our gear, we walked about 5 minutes down a path and were met by a Mayan Shaman for a brief prayer ceremony before entering the cave. The cave tour takes about 45 minutes. You don\u2019t have to be super-fit, but you do have to be able to bend low, step down, step up, and be comfortable in dark, enclosed places. Also, there is a point where you are paddling through deep water, but even if you can\u2019t swim, the life jacket keeps you floating. The ages that day appeared to range from teens to 70's. The cave is beautiful, and the tour was just amazing.  After the tour, we changed back into dry clothes and had lunch. They served a very good lunch of soup, salad, tamales, potatoes, tacos, salsas, fruits, ice tea and ice water. They also had beer for purchase. It was a wonderful day!"

After the tour they give you lunch which was pretty tasty - empanadas, tamales, etc. People complain that they don't allow you to take your camera on the tour, but the pictures that they take of you are aweseme since they know how to properly light up all the shots.

Traveled with my son (9) and daughter (8)and I was worried the kids would freak out and fight with each other and ruin it for the other tour guests but say la veee. We were at the front of the pack. They were both mezmorized by the beauty of the cave and both were quiet as a mouse. Well let\u2019s just say one of them. My daughter asked a lot of questions :0).The tour consists of treking through the cave and viewing the wonderful rock formations created by water which existed above the level we were standing. As we walked the water became deeper. Some parts you needed to float through. No swimming required. They provide all the equipment. I suggest a walking stick for the older folks. Rember take your time walking. A few of the guest fell and cut or scratched their leg on a rock. I\u2019m not going to go into detail because it best to save the discovery and go to the tour to truly see what a beauty Rio Secreto .At the end they gave you a small buffet. You will be hungry! The food is quiet delicious better then the food we were eating at the five star resort! At the end they do not force you to buy pictures but you can review them. Make sure if they ask to take your picture to say yes! If you are interested in buying the pictures there are three different price points. I got all my pics plus xtra pics with three shirts for $99. I think it was worth it for the memories.Think about it, if Rio Secreto allowed everyone to take photos the tour would never progress. People would separate and not remain as a group and then they would ruin the growth formations permanenantly in the cave which tooks years to develop! The tour was worth every penny. I would buy the transportion option. Getting there by bus is no problem but from the gate to the acutally cave is a long never endng bumpy road."

I would also suggest that you be reasonably fit and sure footed, as you really have to focus on where you step, and you can't touch the walls around you to maintain your balance. That being said - they do provide walking sticks for anyone who needs one for extra support. You also need to be comfortable in a water environment, though there are only a couple of areas where I had to swim rather than walk ( I'm only 5ft 2 though) Wet suits and lifejackets are provided...and given that it's pretty cold down there, it's a good thing or I'd have been a popsicle by the time we left.The cave formations are awe inspiring, stalactites and stalagmites abound, shawl limestone formations, catfish and bats all add to the allure. Our guide Jovana was marvelous, we had an all English speaking group and she was completely fluent and super friendly. Along the way there are lights set up and everyone has a hard hat with a light attached. Certain areas along the way were lit especially for photo opportunities, though due to the nature of this tour, you can't take your own camera with you. After the tour, lunch is provided, and it was very tasty - especially the lime soup!! There was no \"hard sell\" on the photo's they took, which is always a relief.

You need to be quiet so you can hear the guide, you cannot touch anything unless informed that it is ok to do so and it is 1.5 hours in the water with a combination of walking and swimming.The equipment they provided is well used so do not expect new condition.

We were a bit nervous with the 45 minute drive down a remote bumpy dirt road in the large passenger van. Once we arrived at Rio Secreto, the organization was clearly legitimate with ample restroom facilities, shower, and lockers for us to use, plenty of staff, etc. We were welcomed by the guides and given clear instructions, given wet suit, life vest, and helmut with light. The tour of the caves was fantastic with our guide being really informative and helpful. The ground in the cave is uneven and wet, of course and may be difficult for anyone limited physically. The swimming part was amazing; you don't need to be an expert swimmer because mostly you just float along in your lifejacket. The guides are also very safety conscious. We had a lovely group of people with us (10 in all) and we helped to steady each other over any especially uneven or slippery steps. The tour was well worth the price and we enjoyed the nice Mexican lunch afterward. I agree that the price of the pictures is too steep. We chose not to buy a picture but I now wish we had bought one, even for the $25 price. Overall, a memorable experience. I also want to add that the guides clearly love the cave, are knowledgeable about it's ecology, and committed to its preservation. They are a neat group of people."

Now the caves, what you see in the pictures is what you get HOWEVER you must experience it to FEEL the caves... that is the most beautiful place I have ever seen in my life... A++++ if I had one day in Mexico again this is exactly what I would do.... when you come out of the caves you feel so sad you have to leave... go go go!"

            "review": "Yes it REALLY is life changing!. I was with a group of people who went on this tour through our company while in Mexico. At dinner the night before I was telling everyone about some of the reviews I read here on Tripadvisor and we all laughed about the fact that someone wrote going on this tour was \"life changing\"...I mean how can exploring an underground secret river in a cave be life changing? Gorgeous yes, incredible experience -sure- but more than that? Well I rarely post reviews -but after laughing about this just had to come back to say that if you are in this area and have a choice of things to do -you will WANT to choose this one. I can't believe I wasn't afraid -I thought I would be -it was exhilarating and all of us left this experience feeling connected to the Earth, to ourselves. The word \"spiritual\" was used to explain how awe inspiring of an experience it was. It could be that our guide Santiago Villa (I asked him for his name knowing I would write this) was so knowledgeable about the ancient Mayan history which he shared- nothing like hearing about sacred Mayan cultures in a place that is supposedly a sacred Mayan cave . Perhaps it's the realization that there are things on this Earth that most don't think about, but that exist in this case deep below their feet;that have existed long before we were here and will be here long after we are gone. And they send a photographer with each tour group which is awesome because you are in there hoping that it can somehow be captured and shared -but the pictures captured, funny enough they are SO beautiful -people may think they are photo shopped. MUST do- if you have to travel to do it -it's worth it -that is the only way you'll really understand what I'm trying to say. You'll be SO happy and feel so fortunate that you had the opportunity to do this! Oh and PS -there are at least 2 different routes because I noticed some wrote about tight spaces -not so always -while both are supposedly gorgeous -the other half of our group went on the path that people refer to which can be very tight in places for people who may be claustrophobic -we went to the path that had huge wide caverns- I'd recommend that one to anyone -and our guide said the tour we went on with the large wide caverns is his favorite one. And BTW we were not given a choice before hand -so you may want to ask - particularly if you are claustrophobic to go on the route we did with the wide caverns."

            "review": "Rio Secreto - one of the best adventures we have ever undertaken - and we felt safe the whole time!. I had always judged people who end up in water in caves were more than a bit crazy. But that is exactly where we spent nearly 2 hours on our recent trip to Rio Secreto near Playa del Carmen and at no time did we feel concerned for our safety. One reason was that this crystal clear cool underground river meandering in complete darkness throuigh a most magnificent series of limestone caves was a safe place to be. The other reason was that our guides were knowledgable, competent and kept us fully informed. It is not a place for the feeble footed, as the trek involves uneven wet surfaces, craggy rocky edges, swimming, floating under stalactites that bump against the helmet - and all lit by the light on the front of this helmet. I guess the fact that at times the large caverns were floodlight to show us the beauty, also showed us we were in a place of big spaces with only the occasional low roofed passageway - but passageways that were still big enough to be comfortable. And the fact that this is a flat country suggests there will be no sudden flooding. I'm so glad we did it My only disappointment was the cost of the photographs that we were forced to buy if we wanted a momento of our experience as we were not allowed to take cameras underground."

I have trouble putting to words how amazing Rio Secreto is. Our guide was great. She always knew the answers to our questions and made us all feel very comfortable with our surroundings. The caves were beautiful. It was amazing to see something created by nature that can take your breath away. The tunnel system goes on for miles and every turn gives a new group of formations that I could stare at for hours. The water was a bit chilly at first but we all got used to it very quickly. We were provided with wetsuits that helped us from the cool water and getting scratched by the formations. My wife was a bit worried about there being bugs and other creatures in the caves but aside from a couple of bats (that never came near us) we didnt see anything scary. There are many oppourtunites to have your photo taken and you get to review them after to purchase. $25 for 1 photo of your choice on a disc or $69 for all of them (about 20). The photos are expensive but the whole excursion was not overpriced so I justified it by working it into the cost of the entire trip. There is some swimming (with life jackets provided), a bit of climbing, and some low ceilings. I would go back to Rio Secreto in a heartbeat and I have told everyone I can about this amazing place."

It really has to be experienced to appreciate the beauty. It is also a nice break from the afternoon heat since you are underground for about 1.5 hours.The tour includes a Mayan buffet afterwards. The food was very good.The only comment I have on the negative side is that you cannot take a camera. They have a photographer throughout, but the photos are very expensive. Having said that, they are also VERY well done, so may be worth the money for some people. We certainly would not have taken photos as nice on our own camera."

Many of them spoke excellent English. The 15-minute van ride to the cavern entrance was bumpy, but that's what it feels like on an unpaved jungle road. The wetsuits and helmets do smell faintly of mildew, but through similar water-sport excursions I've experienced, I think that's just what rentals smell like. Our tour guide, Alfredo, did a bilingual tour, and his translation was impressively precise. He's also just a really personable guy. The tour wasn't too strenuous. If the idea of hiking and swimming (life jackets keep you afloat) your way along a guided tour of some incredibly beautiful caverns appeals to you, I recommend Rio Secreto. I'm not sure why previous reviews complained about the lunch. I thought it was delicious. I can understand why people complained about the photos. I do agree with the no-photo policy. It would be irresponsible to allow tourists to bring their own cameras into the cavern, not only in terms of conservation, but also safety. But the pricing of the professional photos ($25 for one, $69 for all, $100 for all + 3 souvenirs) so encourages you to purchase the whole package, that it you do feel manipulated. Still, the pricing is on par with similar excursions, and it does benefit the conservation of the cavern, so I can't complain."

I read a review that complained that it's not time to play, but I was glad the visit was totally guided because I was worried that we would destroy this amazing place with our impact in this ecosystem. However, the staff at Rio Secreto are very organized and very strict. They constantly remind you that nothing should be touched in the cave and point out the few places you are allowed to touch for balance. While you appreciate the beauty of this amazing undeground place, the guide provided detailed explanations and a professional photographer takes de most incredible pictures.

It is an amazing experience and just wonderful. They provide everything (except swim suit and towel). So even if you have an underwater camera, your own wetsuit, don't bother bringing it - they won't let you use it anyway. They keep strict control on potential contaminants getting into the underground water system. So much so you cannot wear your watch or any significant jewellry. They do have secure places for you to store you belongings so there is nothing to worry about. If you are not sure footed or lack a lot of mobility it can be hard. People have broken ankles and fallen and broken arms in here. If you're careful and listen to the guide and enlist their help when needed you should have no problems. We would do this again in a heartbeat it was just so amazing. You will get presented with the option to buy photo packages on the way out - and they are spectacular pictures, but they are not cheap and staff do take \"no\" in stride and don't push too hard. We've done lots of things in Mexico - this is one (hands down) that I would say is a true MUST DO!"

Sometimes you are walking on dryland, sometimes the water is up to your knees, and other times you have to swim. The stalactites and stalagmites are incredible. The root system of the above trees is amazing. You are followed by a photographer who takes individual and group photos. My favorite part of this tour was when we were all instructed to be still in the water and turn our lights off and just listen. You could hear the drips in the cave and it was truly an amazing experience. Bring money (you are provided with a locker) because at the end of the tour you can purchase the professional photos. They are worth it! We bought the disk that has all the pics on it and it is a treasured keepsake. Overall this is a must do! We will return."

My wife and I travel frequently and both agree that this is one of our favorite things we have ever done. The price includes your entry fee and all the equipment you need (Helmet, wetsuit, water shoes, light and vest.) It also include a really good lunch (try the lime soup!). The only thin not included is the photo CD. At first I was really upset they did not allow cameras and thought they were trying to extract more money from you. 10 minutes into the cave though and I completely understand. First, there are times when you have to have your whole body up to your mouth in the water to avoid hitting the ceiling so a camera must be water proof. Second, the water is not clear in places so if you were to drop it, it would be gone forever and litter the cave. Third, many places you hold hands for support so you need both hands free. Lastly, they had flashes set up everywhere so you could actually see the cave. The little flash on your camera would not light up enough to see anything anyways. The pictures are a little expensive. We paid $69 for all of them, about 25, but they came out great and they even filtered out the rest of our group so it was just my wife and myself, not a bunch of people we don't know.They take you down in groups of 10 or so. Our guide was named Victor and was wonderful! We only saw another group twice in the entire 90 minutes so it doesn't feel overcrowded at all. The formations were awesome. Some places had thousands in one room. The largest one we saw went from floor to ceiling and must have had a diameter of 4-5 feet. Take their caution about claustrophobia seriously. There are some tight spaces. That said however, my wife can be claustrophobic and while there were a few times she was nervous, she was fine and did great. I have to say that everyone was very professional and very helpful. We would do this tour again in a heartbeat if we get the chance to."

            "review": "Awe Inspiring!. Let me start by saying that our guide was Rodrigo - who is FABULOUS! Very knowledgeable, caring, and has great communication skills. The price included: guide, transportation, walking stick, wet suit, locker with key, water shoes, and a good lunch. Very well organized tour lasting about 2 hours. Highly recommend taking the wet suit and walking stick. I'm healthy and hike often and still found the walking stick to be a must. Its a short walk on a trail and then you go into the cave and its about 1/2 mile exploration! The part where you just float thru the cave is one of the best things I've ever experienced. Also, the darkness and quiet was powerful. Its a difficult thing to describe, but I can say its something you should not miss!  Only downfall was that the bus driver to the caves was not very friendly and the ride was pretty bumpy. Cannot bring your camera, which we were upset about at first, but, after doing the tour, I can understand why....definitely glad I didn't have anything but my steps to worry about. I think it is a safety hazard and a pollution hazard and they are really trying hard to preserve the caves.The pics are kinda pricy, but it goes to conserve the environment and also for the equipment maintenance. They have to change out equipment every 3 months due to the humidity within the caves. We bought the mid range package for $69 and split the cost between our group. Totally worth it to us. Clearly, I absolutely LOVED this experience. It's like nothing I have ever done before! If I had not been leaving the next morning, I would have gone back to do this again before I left. There are 3 routes Joy, Palace, & Supreme. We did the route called Joy. Awe Inspiring!"

Our group of 10 (max. #) guided by Alfredo (you can book him in advance if the group is large enough) stopped for a Mayan blessing prior to entering the first cave. WOW!! You have to stop to look up - turn your light on and just enjoy the entire tour of stalactites and stalagmite and column formations. The tour goes fast (1.5 hours) of walking and swimming (you have a wetsuit, watershoes, lifevest, helmet and light) able bodied people only recommended. We saw tiny catfish and phytoplancton, an eco-system in the tree roots taking in the fresh waters of the river and more. Photos are taken by their staff and are worth the purchase. Shower, change rooms and a great Mexican lunch that you never want to leave wrap up the terrific one of a kind in the world excursion. This is a unique river cave system tour not to be missed."

The caves themselves are something like you've never seen before and the fact you're in there swimming around (at times in areas where you can't touch), is remarkably. It's a one-of-a-kind experience that will not disappoint you. In addition, the cave tour was followed up by a very nice Mexican lunch which was not expected. Followed up with a few hours to spare for shopping at the end it was a wonderful day and again, a highly reccommended trip."

The water is crystal clear and very very beautiful! If you have to choose one, I would probably recommend Dos Ojos, but if you have time go to both places!!!"

I completely agree with the five star reviews however i did find myself wishing the tour allowed for lingering and really soaking in the wonders that are before you. Our guide was wonderful and gave us insight on the history of Mayan culture. I was happy to spend my money there as it also goes toward the conservation of this amazing sight, however i did wish we didn't just walk through. Most of the time you walk through, watch where you are going....look up and go aaaaah...while trying not to fall. All in all, i was very glad to have gone. Please be prepared for the very rough van ride coming in and out of the site. In a hot van, with no AC or shocks, i was very uncomfortable!"

Our guide was Kuri....he was amazing and made a great trip excellent. He was passionate about his job and the ecosystem and took time to answer any question.2. We got changed/ suited up/....you can take nothing except your bathing suit.3. We took a 15 minute drive in a van....HOLY BUMPY BATMAN....enough said4. Got there...had a Shaman ritual to bless us and teach more about the Cenote...that was cool.5. The terrain was pretty steep for someone that has any difficulty walking, bending or stooping. We would recommend to ask for a walking stick if you do.6. The Cenote was amazing...everything was like nothing our family had seen...we brought our 11 yo son (perfect age to appreciate and keep up). Again Kuri explained everything but was not verbose....really took time to let everyone experience the Cenote. We all turned out our flashlights....and it was darker than dark...very fun....This took about 90 minutes...7. Left the Cenote...got out of our gear....you had the option to buy various packages (they were never pushy or salesy)....and we did a shot of some really tasty liquor to celebrate. Lunch was good and we chatted with the other families...the grounds were perfect.GREAT EXPERIENCE! Must do if you have not done Rio Secreto...highly recommend our guide.THanks Kuri!Taylors"

Let me start by saying that it is advisable to book your tour in advance as the number of people in a group is limited.The whole tour is very well organized. First you pay the fee, then they give you a short introduction to what the plan is and then they take you to the cenote area on a van (the trip is about 15 minutes and the road is a bit rough). You are given a locker, where you put your clothes and belongings and take a shower to take off the oiliness of your skin which could damage the cenote environment.Then you are given your gear and after a short walk through the forest you arrive at the cenote. We were lucky as our group was just 6 people, the experience was amazing! One of the most wonderful things I've ever seen/done in my life. For more than an hour you walk, crawl and swim through a beautiful cenote with a guide who is ready to help you, support you on a slippery rock and also provides a very informative narrative.After the tour, lunch is provided and I think there is babysitting on site for people with babies.I would recommend this adventure to anyone going to the Riviera Maya region (there was even a non-swimmer in our group)."

            "review": "This is a MUST SEE if you are in the Riviera Maya!. This is a must see attaraction for those who are facinated with caves, stalagtite and stalagmite figurations, and geological history.This cave system was recently discovered (I believe 2007) and is soon to be on the UNSECO World Heritage protected list. The guides who work there love the area and our guide, Jean really loved his job!Once you check in at the front location, you are boarded on a bus (with AC) down a dirt road that has its fair share of pot holes. After a 15 minute ride into the jungle we arrived at a lush green jungle location with several buildings. We were given small pad locks with keys and shown to a few banks of lockers to store our personal items. When at the site, no cameras are alowed into the cave system, so be prepared to store them with your personal effects.You are also asked to take a quick shower (outdoor showers) to help clean off all of the sunscreen and lotions that could ruin and react with the calcium carbonate in the rock formations in the cave. Amidst getting some information about the Rio Secreto area you are sized up for a wet suit, lifevest, water shoes and a helemt with light.After a quick team picture, the guide leads you through the jungle on a fairly easy path until you reach a Mayan shaman who blesses the group for a safe travel through the 'underworld'. From there you enter the mouth of the cave. It is absolutely spectacular. There are stalagtites and stalagmites of yellow, blue and red hues. After some walking, you start to wade through the cave system until later in the tour you need to float down long stretches. With the life vest it is really as easy as a simple breast stroke. There are camera men that join the tour and take pictures at certain areas of the cave. We purchased the disc of photos and were very happy with them.After the underground tour you are treated to an authentic Mexican lunch with tacos, tamales, soup, salad, and of course salsa!This is an absolute gem, and it is highly recomended!"

Little extras made it special like the Mayan prayer service to enter the cave and the buffet after was really good. Beware that several areas towards the end of the tour, you have to swim. The water is deep and requires everyone to swim. Most of the time the water is below your knees but not always and it depends on the season. The adults and teenagers in our group were fine, but my 9-year old was so cold he was shivering through the water and he did have a wetsuit. There are also areas where you have to squat through tight chambers and climb up, down, and through rocks. It is somewhat physical and everyone in our group got a little scraped up here & there. The ride from the entrance down to the cave is a good 15 minutes on really bumpy dirt roads so beware of that as well. Overall it was really good. Be sure to smile for all the many camera's that you see in the cave so you have good pictures at the end!"

Price from the Gran Bahai Principe Coba was $99 each including a lunch. It was a very interesting experience. We were in a group of 9 believe with Tania as our tour guide. Once at the site, you have to drive about 15 minutes inland to the actual cave area. We were on an air conditioned bus. The ride is quite bumpy but kind of a fun ride! Once there, you are given a wet suit, helmet with a light, water shoes and a life jacket. Wear your bathing suit. You can't take a camera with you but there is a photographer that follows the tour and takes pictures off you at various points along the way. You are totally underground following and walking in the rivers. The coral and different minerals, etc. are quite dramatic to see. There is the occasional bat and maybe a spider but they don't bother with you. One word of caution to anyone who has trouble walking, etc. The terrain is quite rocky and certain parts of the route are tricky to navigate. You can ask for a walking stick to take with you. You must be sure footed and have good balance to walk in these caves. There was an older, large woman in our group who needed quite a bit of help to climb over certain areas. There are some low spots to get through as well. Also, you will walk through water several times and near the end you are over your head, but the life jacket will help anyone who can't swim. There is one point where we all turned off our lights and were very quiet. It was an interesting moment. It's about a 90 minute tour. When you are done they give you a shot of some liquor, Tastes like Sambuca! While you are drinking that, they set up the pictures they took on computers for you to view. We had some cash on us but didn't expect the pictures to be so expensive. One picture was $25US, your group pictures were $69 and I think for $120US you could get a CD with these plus other pictures. A little too pricey. I would have liked to have one of us. So remember to bring enough cash. They did say they could email them and you can pay for it through Paypal. After looking at pictures you get to sit down for a light lunch - salad, soup, and some local mexican fare. It was ok, but I'm a bit wary of eating off the resort, especially soup and lettuce probably washed with local water. Once finished lunch you are picked up by your tour bus and back to the hotel. They were very organized with the tours/group and buses. Overall, a very unique experience and worth the money."

We were dropped off at the roadside building for the attraction and were given instructions and a desciption of what we were about to experience.. We were then loaded in to another van and headed off in to the interior of the countryside. It was quite a bumpy ride and not very comfortable but I forgot all about the discomfort of the ride the minute we arrived at the site.. It was great, very well run,we were given lockers for our stuff and then we recieved lifejackets and walking sticks, we then proceeded to showers as they want to keep the caves pristine.. It was very ecologically acceptable.. The guides who work there obviously care very much about the site.. We proceeded to a hole to go underground. I was in awe the minute we started and stayed that way the whole tour which was about an hour and a half.. We walked , waded, swam and floated in different areas. The rock formations and the stalactites/stalagmites were pristine. It was very obvious that it was a natural treasure.. The guide was very informative and answered every question we had. It was obvious she was in love with the place herself..I would not do this if I had any mobility problems or any heart conditions, shortness of breath etc..it is not strenuous but still for the physically fit.. It would also not be good for anyone who feels the least claustrophbic..I don't normally buy the dvd's that these places supply for a fee but this one was worth it..I recommend this tour for anyone who loves pristine nature!!"

We booked online from home with absolute ease receiving our confirmation and pick up time from our hotel within one day. Upon arrival, you are greeted and given great instructions and put into groups and assigned a guide. Getting dressed takes a few minutes, but it ensures you are safe and comfortable. Make sure you get water shoes that are tight for your feet - it makes it easier once in the water. Our guide Dani (sp) was incredible and provided good history, information and hints to enjoy. Once down in the River, you will see and experience nature at it's best. Approximately 1.5 hours underground and you are tired, but want more! For a couple in our 50's we felt very comfortable and it did not find it physically taxing at all. After exiting, you get a nice lunch and the opportunity to purchase pictures (their are photographers underground along your route) We purchaed the full CD at 69.00 - I felt it was worth it or you would not have any pictures as cameras are not allowed in the river. Rio Secreto - a do not miss when in the Mayan and highly recommended!"

The guide was very accommodating and had my husband walk behind her with the 5 yr. old so she could lend a hand.DEFINITELY take the walking stick. I almost didn't despite reading that it helps in a previous review because when I Iooked around, no one else seemed to be taking one. So glad I didn't follow the crowd. It really helps navigate the ground below that changes constantly and also gives you something to lean on when lowering yourself in the caves (you are not allowed to touch anything in the cave to stablize your weight).Yes, the wetsuits are wet but I didn't think they smelled. The helmet on the other hand smelled. I wished that I had thought beforehand because I would have taken a paper coffee filter to use between my head and the helmet (a camp trick to prevent lice spread in helmets). Just a tip to think about...The sheer beauty in the caves in magnificent. You will not believe your eyes and it will restore your faith in the power of God that something so wonderful was created (and I'm totally not religious but it is awesome).Oh, also, there are different trails so ask the guide if you are afraid of being claustrophobic. We did not experience any claustrophobia and I am assuming that they gave us an easier trail given that we had a small child.Another reviewer mentioned that the photographer was annoying but we loved the photos. They are really unique and so beautiful so I am glad they provided the service."

Recommend this trip for anyone wanting to have an experience none of their friends have done without risking injury. Not for young children, need to be able to swim at least a little. Can't be afraid of the dark because when the lights are all turned off it is very, very dark. Small groups of about 10 so you don't feel like just one in the crowd. Photographers did a nice job capturing the trip. You can't take a camera or phone into the cave so plan on buying the CD with your pictures. A little pricey but half the proceeds goes to preservation of the sites"

I was deeply touched by the spiritual ceremony delivered by a Maya prior to starting the tour. The quiet, ultimate quiet, experienced once in the cave was memorable. A sense of deep serenity embraced me. I was awed by the delicate yet strong and intriguing sculptures produced by nature. The tour guide stressed the importance of respect for this environnment. The experience was definitely worth the effort. As we are older and not that healthy, perhaps a reduced version (less than an hour) of the tour could be developped. Make sure to bring enough money (minimum 30$ and up to 100$ for the full package) to pay for the wonderful pictures taken by the accompanying photographer. It was not possible to purchase more pictures after the tour and we had not brought enough money. For that, we will be forever sorry. But the memories live on."

AGES OF CHILDREN WE HAD: 5, 14, 12This trip was very interesting and fun, some people complained about it and called it a \"tourist trap\", but maybe that was their tour guide of experience. We had a great tour guide who really knew what she was talking about, unfortunately I forget her name (she was female though) but I give her credit for speaking to half of the group in spanish and to us in english.TIPS/THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW:-Some people said it was a tight space, but you are moving around and seeing all these amazing formations that you kind of forget about it, and their are only some parts where you have to crouch down.-When your tour guide asks you if you want a WALKING STICK SAY YES! Even though you have to swim with it, it is very helpful considering you can't touch the formations.-THEY SUPPLY TOWELS AND LOCKERS TO PUT YOUR ITEMS IN-They give you a \"snack\" after you are done, but it is lunch, its a small buffet sort of thing, and the food was good."

It was a fun and enjoyable tour of this underground cave. Very neat to see this new world. Fun to walk part way and swim part way. Guide (Tanya) was excellent. Food was fairly good. I have to say the pictures were quite expensive ($25 for 1 picture). We only bought one, however, would have considered buying more if they had turned out properly. I think the photographers should put more time/effort into ensuring a good picture (ie. no one blinking). When you first pull up to Rio Secreto you wait until there are enough people to do the tour (we waited about 15 minutes) and then were driven down a bumpy dirt road to the entry point of the cave (about 15 minutes). It is there that you are provided with your wetsuit, water shoes and guide. The tour itself is about 1-1.5 hours in the cave. Following this you can dry off, change, look at your pictures and eat."

Alfredo has such a passion for exploring caves and the natural beauty of Rio Secreto, that like he explained, this isn't a job for him, it's his lifes passion. He was so knowledgable, and full of information. Anyone who decides to view this natural wonder, and is fortunate enough to have Alfredo as a tour guide, will surely not be disappointed. As I think of things to write in my review to describe in a few words how amazing Rio Secreto is, I'm left with a loss for words, as words just can't explain how breathtaking this tour is. What I can say is that visitors get the oppurtunity to explore something that has been a million years in the making of natural wonder and has only just been discovered. From the amazing crystal formation to the clear blue waters, this experience was absolutely wonderous. The fact that half of the proceeds from photos purchased goes to preserving the area makes it that much better. I would recommend this to anyone, old or young."

It's astonishing what lies underground. I am so glad they discovered this hidden gem - everyone needs to see this. The guides were great, learned alot, safety was priority, They warned us that there may be bats, blind eels and cat fish in the waters. We only saw baby catfish. Nothing to be afraid of in the waters. Water was very clear not murkey. The waking paths in the secret river can be challenging. lots of rocks and things to step over. They offer walking sticks to people who may need extra help as you cannot hold onto any of the rocks or walls in the caves. All equipment is provided - water shoes, wet suit, life jacket and helmet with a head lamp. You only have to swim for about 5 minutes of this tour and the swim is the best part - so cool!! water temp is good. Not very cold. Hot lunch included after the tour - it was delicious (traditional mexican food) I highly recommend doing this tour! We went March 5th 2012."

In that world of dark and silence, such beautiful stalactites and stalagmites are shaped though endless time.The tour is very well organized, tourists are receiving protection helmets, wetsuit and life jacket and staff is helpful.

            "review": "An underworld experience like no other - JUST DO IT. We decided to take the Rio Secreto tour from our hotel, and we were NOT disappointed. We were picked up in a mini-van and taken to an open-air \"office\" to register, then another van drove us along a very bumpy dirt road for about 15 minutes to get to the cave entrance. We were outfitted with wetsuits (don't expect a perfect fit), water shoes (you can wear your own if you have them), lifejackets and a head lamp. Everyone was encouraged to rinse off first, as the water in the cenotes is pure and they don't want it contaminated with human's sunscreen, body lotions, make-up, bandaids or deodorant. You're given a locker to keep your valuables in. We were split into groups, depending on the language spoken. Our guide, Mauricio, was young, energetic, helpful, interesting, and obviously loves his job.We walked 5 minutes down a jungle path and stopped to be blessed by a shaman. Apparently the Mayans believe the caves are the \"underworld\" so a prayer was said for our safe return! From there we walked down some steps into the mouth of a dry cave, where we were given a safety talk and a brief explanation of the do's and don't (ie: be careful where you step, don't touch anything as the oils from our skin contaminate the limestone, etc.) Walking sticks are provided for those who wish them.From there we walked deep into the cave, which gradually dropped down until we were wading knee deep, then thigh deep, then waist deep, and eventually we were swimming .8 km through the most remarkable maze of caves you can imagine! There's a \"lifeline\" in case you get lost, to help you find your way out. Mauricio told us that there are two main tours - \"Joy\" which is the one we were on, and \"Supreme\". Although the tours depart regularly, we didn't see or hear anybody else during our entire adventure. There were only 7 of us in our group plus Mauricio and our own personal photographer (we weren't allowed to take our own camera). Pictures were taken periodically - some posed, some not.Suffice it to say that you have to see it to believe it. I've attached some pictures, but they don't do it justice. It takes years for stalagmites to form, and even longer for stalagtites as they grow up instead of down. You will learn lots, but it isn't the boring kind of talk that reminds one of school days gone by. It's fascinating lore, eg: we learned that 20% of the Yucatan's drinking water comes from the cenotes.We were underground for about an hour and a half, and when we emerged we were in a different part of the jungle. It was a short walk back to the start, where we handed back our borrowed gear and were given a fluffy towel to dry off. We were taken to a building and shown the pictures that were taken (done with face recognition so only the ones you're in show up, which was very cool!). The price was high - $25 per photo, or $69 for a CD containing all the photos plus 50 professional shots of the flora and fauna of the area. Half the proceeds, we were told, go towards conservation so that made me feel good.We were then given a hot Mayan lunch which was a nice surprise! When we were ready, mini-vans were waiting to take us back to our hotel.This trip was a real treat - the guides were great, the scenery was spectacular, and it was a very DIFFERENT kind of adventure. You can't do this just anywhere, so do it when you're in Mexico - and have fun!"

I have been to Cozumel numerous times and was looking for something a bit different to do. I had done Tulum, snorkeling, beach parties and so on. I was originally thinking about doing to the sweat lodge (#1 tour on trip advisor) but though the price was a bit too high ($80USD pp). Ultimately, due to laziness I was stuck on a cruise ship with no excursion. Typically, I would never pick an excursion off the cruise line menu but I was stuck with no other choice. I decided to go with the most adventurous activity in hopes that I would be shuffled around like cattle on some slow moving tour. I can tell you know I made the right decision as there were only 6 people on the tour with us. Rio Secreto offered one of the most unique experiences I have had. With a short ferry ride over the main land we were picked up by a van and driven through the city to the jungle. Beware this is a very, very bumpy ride. After 45 minutes or so you end up in a park-like setting where you will change into wetsuits, be fitting with a head lamp and meet your guide. This is when the adventure begins!I learned that this cave system was just discovered in 2007 when the land owner was hunting iguana and when the iguana went into a hole he heard something hit water. Now, I have been in caves in the US and Belize and I have never seen anything like this! At the beginning of the tour we were greeted by a Mayan shaman who smudged us since we were headed into, what the Mayan's believe is the underworld. After this ceremony we are lead down some steps and into the cave system. Please keep in mind you should be in decent physical shape as you have to crawl, step over rocks and swim in this system. I decided to be in the back of the line since I knew I wanted to take my time. Again, it was quite slippery and I fall a few times, no harm done. There is also a professional photographer in the caves to take pictures...but, they are on the pricier side 70$ for the CD of all photos or $25 each. Bottom line, if you see something on your cruise excursions called Amazing Secret River BOOK IT! It is completely worth it. Check out my photos and feel free to ask any questions you may have. Fee for the excursion (through the cruise line) $99 ppFeel for all photos $70Amazing lunch buffet INCLUDED Transportation INCLUDED"

This cave/cenote/river system is in excellent condition and it's clear that the owners/managers take their stewardship of this natural treasure very seriously. Simply amazing. Loved the Mayan blessing before we entered, our period of time in the dark, and, of course, the caves themselves. Our guide Benito was fantastic--he loves his job and really knows his stuff. He fielded some fairly complex questions and we all came out better educated than when we began while having fun at the same time. Finished up just as our stomachs were starting to growl and found the included meal to be pretty good. Other details: Yes the dirt road is bumpy getting there...so what? You're in the country in Mexico, and that's how they are. People complain here on TA about the wetsuits stinking--for us they were wet but not gross. Same with the shoes. Take note, however: I'm not a feeble person, but with all the uneven footing on top of not being allowed to touch anything (skin oils will damage the formations) I highly recommend the walking sticks! You'll get to look up more and less at your feet.As for the picture taking, I have mixed feelings about them. I too would have preferred more time spent looking at the formations and less posing for pix. It just reeks of \"prepackaged tour\" when that's happening, something I generally avoid when traveling. But half the $$ earned goes to preservation of the caves and I believe them when they say that. We were 8 in our group so it didn't cost much to buy the cd and share.All in all it's a well-run if sometimes overly scripted tour, especially with the corny pictures. Based on other reviews here, it seems the quality of the guide staff is quite high, though. We sure loved ours. So if you're going there to get inside those exquisite caves and discover for yourself what lies beneath your feet when in the Yucatan, you'll feel (like we did) that you've gotten more than your money's worth. It's jaw-droppingly beautiful, spiritual, and awe inspiring.Kudos to these folks for doing a sustainable operation in a region that is generally happy to sell out to the highest bidder, no matter what the environmental cost. I do wish, though, that they'd do the tour at a more leisurely pace with a bit less energy devoted to the pictures."

Our youngest did just fine though. You will be swimming at one point the water is app. 15 ft. deep. You have on a life vest and a wet suit to keep you warm. My oldest so loved it that he wants to try every cave out there now. The lunch after was very good also. I packed some snacks that we ate before we went into the caves and I'm glad we had them because the bus ride was long. They drop you off at a check point then you take another ride in there transportation thats about 15 min. That ride is a tough one. It's through the jungle and of course the roads are not paved and it's VERY bumpy. In the end it was all worth it. If you can request Alfredo, do it he was great.

I am in my 50's and it is hard to keep up with the tour as it goes so fast you have to watch every step and you don't even get to look up at the beauty of the cave. The gear they give you is falling apart and still soaking wet. I don't think that they are even sanitized between uses which is just nasty. The price is way to high, and you should not have to pay to eat that buffet at the end of the tour. We were the last tour of the day and the food was setting out, and not kept up to temperature. Come on, it was stone cold, tasted terrible and flies were everywhere. The tea was all water as they don't want to make more at the end of the day. It was a hot mess. It's unfortunate that a nice place is run in this manner. They need to do away with the buffet. I'm lucky to not have walked away with food poisoning...then again, I only ate a banana....never, never eat any food that is cold, unless it is meant to be. I would not recommend this tour. There are way to many free and cheap places to discover if you do your homework."

Arrived after a 45 minute Van Ride.. switched to another Van with a 10 minute ride to Check In. Divided into Groups depending on your language spoken. Rodrigo was assigned to the English Speaking Group and he is oh so wonderful. Very informed, friendly & spirited.You are fitted into Water Mocs, Wet Suit & Life Vest. You are then led to a Mayan who blesses all who enter the Underground. This AMAZING Underground River reveals incredible formations created by the stalactites & stalagmites that have been in development these last 2 Million Years. It was only discovered 6 years ago and opened to the public 4 years ago!!! One of those experiences you never forget.No individual cameras aloud but they have a Camera team that take set up shots which you purchase later.After the Rio Secreto Experience a small lunch is provided with a lime chicken soup & other edibles. There is a seated area to eat.A truly unforgettable experience."

We had an amazing time with him during our tour (Supreme route). I sprained my ankle earlier in the year and Rodrigo made sure I was taken care of at all times. He even gave me a nice wood cane to help me during the route. It was a fabulous experience walking / swimming into the many caves and learning how they were formed. We were taught not to touch anything since any human skin oils would kill the formations. Rio Secreto is very environmentally responsible which is admirable - they have 3 routes and rests one so you go on 1 of 2 routes. We were also given a locker, wet suit, life jacket and helmet with a light, and had to shower to remove all skin/hair products before entering the caves.We were blessed by a Mayan elder before entering the caves since the Mayans consider them the underworld. The path was not slippery and the waters were pristine. We saw several small bats and a fish. Rodrigo turned off the lights at one time and we were in complete silence and darkness for a few minutes - it was very peaceful and wish we could have taken a nap (lol)! We went through many caves and saw many gorgeous formations. I would highly recommend this experience!!At several selected points the photographers took pictures of us. We got the package of all our photos on a CD, plus photographers' photos of the wildlife and caves, plus 3 items (a RIo Secreto t shirt, a 4G usb thumb drive and a honey liquor bottle) for only $99. Compared to other tourist places, this was an amazing deal.The lunch afterwards was cooked by local Mayan women and it was delicious. Loved the lime soup with chicken. Rio Secreto opened for tourism in 2008 after being discovered in 2006. It is seeking UNESCO world heritage status and we hope it will obtain it soon. This place needs to be protected and it was an absolute privilege to be able to visit! I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Rio Secreto above all other excursions in the area, especially if you are drawn to the miracles of nature."

I am not that unfit but he made me walk behind and hold his hand--he totally ruined the experince for me. He also hurried everyone so fast I am surprised no one fell down---stopping only for pictures. No where in the literature does it say you need to be able to navigate very rocky slippery paths ----the lunch was good.

He was very informative, friendly, and cheerful. We really enjoyed the trip with him and the cenote was very grand and impressive. I went back a few days later and walked/floated through Joy with Alanis. He did a great job of giving the entire tour in Spanish and in English as we were the only 2 English speakers on that particular tour. I liked Joy a bit better because it had a lot more swimming and the passageways were narrower so you felt a bit more like you were spelunking. But either one is sure to make you feel like it was worth every dollar. They really do it right there as the complex is well done, the guides are well trained and there's a tasty lunch afterward. Just plan to make it an all day trip bc on the second trip we had to wait almost an hour for the van to come pick us up to go back to the entrance."

But besides that, I thought everything was very good. Our guide Corinne (spelling) had a very thick French accent but I managed to understand most of what she said. I was concerned about my claustrophobia and another woman was hyperventilating even before our tour started (her fear was water), but the guide helped us both through it. The caves were stunning. We were disappointed, though, that there wasn't really any swimming, due to low water level. The last five minutes of the tour, though, involved a very low ceiling, so I don't see how we could have gone through that part if the water had been any higher! Some of the reviews mentioned inadequate food, but that must have changed because we had a very nice buffet lunch. Also I don't agree that the photo prices were out of line. Go to any tourist attraction where they take pictures and you'll find the same thing. If you go to the Skywalk at the Grand Canyon you'll pay even more, as they too don't allow cameras or any other personal items. This is just a part of doing touristy things--get over it and move on! But overall we felt that the trip was well worth every penny, not only for the great photos and memories, but also for the fact that I conquered one of my fears."

Our guide, Alfredo, was very knowledgeable about the cave and river, and very patient. You don wet suits and life jackets and water shoes before going into the cave. You walk, wade, and swim on your journey. Your head has to stay out of the water when you swim, so it's more like a dog paddle. Cameras are not allowed in the cave. There is a professional photographer who takes pictures as you go through, and you can purchase a disc at the end of your trip. This is not a trip for small children.

We generally avoid cruise tours due to their high cost and filled to capacity bookings. We made an exception for this tour due to the logistics of taking a ferry from the port on Cozumel to Mainland Mexico at Playa del Carmen . From there, you've still got about a 20 minute trip to the nature preserve. Overall, it seemed risky to try it on our own so we reluctantly booked with the cruiseline. Well, we're here to report that it was an amazing trip - about 8 hours long, all logistics taken care of from the ferry to the caves to lunch (a good buffet of local fare at the nature preserve) time to explore the shops or beach of Playa del Carmen before returning to Cozumel by ferry. The best part of the trip were the caves. You gear up - short wetsuit, life vest, helmet, lights- and are taken in small groups (8 of us plus our guide) in to the cave for about 2 hours. We were told that there are so many entrances that they never have to have more than one group in one section of the cave so you feel like you're the only ones in the entire cave - no distracting lights or noises from other groups. The caves are beautifully decorated and you walk and swim through them in crystal clear water. A photographer takes pictures at various pre-lit areas in the cave and you can purchase a disk when after your tour (pricey , diisks start at about $70!, but since camera's aren't allowed on the tours if you want photos they've got you!) We generally go caving instead of on cave trips but this was one of ourmost memorable cave trips ever. No experience really needed - just the ability to walk and float through gorgeous caves. If any of this description sounds interesting to you ... DO IT,!!"

            "review": "Once in a lifetime. We nearly didn't do this tour because of the cost. At 89usd we thought it pretty expensive but I was really glad we did. Rio Secreto is an underwater cave system that was discovered in 2006 but only opened for tourists in 2008. You are decked out with water shoes, wetsuit and life jacket then taken on a 700m walk through the cave (there is a little swimming involved but nothing strenuous). You also wear a helmet with a light so you can see where to go. The water is crystal clear and the caves are full of stalactites and stalacmites and is truly beautiful and incredibly interesting to see. I believe this is the only place in the world todo it. My sometimes hard to please 13 year old daughter rated it her number 1 tour of our trip which is not easy since we have been to San Francisco and New York as well. After the trip they show you photos taken inside the cave by a photographer that goes with the group. A bit pricey at 69usd but we bought the, anyway. Lunch is served which was surprisingly good and then you are transported ack to your hotel. An incredible experience and one I won't forget."

They provide you with water shoes, swim vest and helmet with light - you need all of these for your adventure. To sum it up, it is like an undergrond hike - then a lovely swim (underground). The guide was great, fun-loving (our group was having a wonderful time - lots of laughter) and informative, but careful to help those (of us) who were a little older and maybe not as nimble on our feet as the young ones in the group. This is a 1/2 day event and worth every penny. When you are finished your \"hike\" they provide a lunch - which in our case was a litle rushed because we were having so much fun!!!"

He took his time and explained everything to us. As we made our way into the caves we came upon the river. You only get to explore a fraction of it so as you walk/swim through you just see endless amounts of off shoots inside the cave. The water is so nice too. You can see perfectly to the bottom even in the parts that are 15 feet deep. It was really an amazing trip. They say you get a snack at the end of the trip but its really a meal served buffet style. We had potato rolled taco's, tamales, salad, fresh soup and salsa's, beans and rice, etc. Don't be a woos, go for the green salsa."

This created a network of underground rivers, sacred wells \"cenotes\" and caves that are great for exploring.

A place for adventure and fantastic photography for most age groups. While not wheel chair accessible, Rio Secreto does not require previous training."

Great precaution is made to offset continuing damage people can (unmeaningly) do to the delicate ecosystem there. The groups are no more than 12 people and you are with a same language speaking group. Our guide Dante was well spoken in several languages and passionate about what he was sharing and teaching us.This tour is not for those who are out of shape. Though it is not rigorous it is challenging. To start with it it a 10 - 15 minute drive in a van over a rough road. Neck or back troubles.... I don't recommend it. For the river tour I was skeptical but wanted to try, I am a large lady with a bad foot. Between the heat, the of climbing (stairs and mounds) and the very uneven terrain in the cavern I did not make it very far in. (My foot was hurting me greatly). From the beginning the very friendly staff let all of us know that we could bow out at anytime. They were encouraging and very helpful but I was slowing everyone else down and it was just to much for me, so I opted to go back. One of the 3 guides helped me back to the closest exit. I was happy with my choice after I had a cool shower and sat for awhile I just enjoyed being in the jungle. I was never made to feel anything but a welcomed guest.When my family finished their tour we were taken to have lunch at the buffet area. It was a very basic buffet and the food was very good. The tortilla soup was muy bueno!My husband has an issue with confined spaces and he had no problems with the caverns. My daughters, 19 and 22 who, after we booked the excursion were \"not really into going\", absolutely loved it."

We went with a family of four (including kids 9 and 11), and everybody loved it. We took a taxi from the Barcelo Maya Palace resort. It\u2019s only 15-20 minute away. Taxi was something like $20 one way. Our taxi driver met us a few hours later to take us back, which was really nice because we did not have to wait. Rio Secreto is right on the main highway, so they can either call a cab for you or you can try to flag one down. Rio Secreto costs $59/adult and $30/child. The tour is about 3-4 hours long. After a quick orientation at the main entrance, they take you in a van to the main staging area in the jungle. The drive to the staging area is really bumpy and takes at least 15 min, but it adds to the adventure. Our guide was Benito. What a great guy. I\u2019m sure all the guides are good, but he really made a difference. The groups are small, maybe 10 people. We started the tour by getting our wet suits. There are small lockers where you can store things. All you really need is a swimsuit and water shoes (plus the wet suit and helmet/light they give you). No lotion is allowed in order to protect the caves. No cameras allowed either. You can purchase pictures they take afterwards. Once you\u2019re suited up, you take a small trek through the jungle to the cave entrance. Before you enter the cave system, there is a Mayan ceremony to request permission from the gods to enter the sacred mother Earth. It\u2019s really cool and sets the tone for the rest of the excursion. The caves themselves are really beautiful and very large. Benito gave us a great explanation about all the various rock formations we saw, and about the unique animals and small fish that live in the caves. We actually saw a bat sleeping and fly away. What\u2019s great about this tour is you hike through knee deep water about 2/3 the way, and then swim the last 1/3 of the way. The guides light up the caves with lighting that makes it spectacular. The water is so clear and the sand (actually powdered calcium) is pristine white. It\u2019s phenomenal. It\u2019s so quiet and peaceful. At one point, Benito turned off all the lights and we sat in the dark listening to the drip of water in the cave. The whole experience is very spiritual.At the end of the tour, you are \u201cborn back onto the Earth\u201d. There is a toast with a local liquor that\u2019s sweet, but good. The kids had some type of (apple?) juice. You can buy a DVD with all the pictures they take for you. The pictures are high quality and worth the purchase. I think we paid $70 for the DVD. As you wait for your DVD, there is a simple, but nice lunch (nachos and cheese, watermelon, salad, etc) that is included. What an amazing experience. You should try this yourself. You won't regret it."

I tried to avoid all the tacky parks in the area and this worked for me.Small parties go into the cave/s for about 90 minutes (I think -no watches allowed).The caves are beautiful, the experience of walking, crouching, going in the water and swimming is really very pleasant indeed. Our guide was helpful and enthusiastic and I think that we got as much out of the experience as we could without a lot more effort from us clambering around.They provide all the gear and it does the job. There's some pleasant food at the end (I didn't see them advertise it so that was a bonus).I drove myself there from Cancun which was 'interesting'. To get to the cave there is a bumpy road for about 20 minutes, I guess they can't fix that.It's not cheap but I think it's good value. They want the same as the entrance fee for a full set of photos or one photo for US$25 (ouch!). That's the only bit that let's it down but it's not a really hard sell. At half the price I'd probably have the photos."

This was the big excursion that I splurged for based on reviews I found on the Carnival website. I'm so happy I booked this trip. We had the most amazing experience on the tour. The tour operator takes great care to preserve the area and as such there are strict guidelines in terms of what you can bring down into the area. Trust me - when you see this natural wonder in it's most preserved state, you will agree it's worth it. I should also note that groups are deliberately kept to a small number to enhance your experience. Our guide, Benito, was most fantastic. He took extra special care of our daughter Lucy, making her feel not only very safe, but also very special to be leading the tour group with him. Additionally, he laid any fears the adults had to rest with his expert knowledge of the secret river and the caverns beneath the surface. It's impossible to describe what we seen and experienced in words, it's best experienced first hand. We were served an authentic Mexican lunch, which was excellent. The pricing for the photos after was reasonable. Don't miss the delicious adult beverage after.I wish I could thank Benito again. His gentle spirit and genuine love for what he does made the experience once we will all cherish for a lifetime. I hope we cross paths again!!!"

After we gathered with others, we were driven down to the actual attraction area, about a 20 minute ride of road, that's why it's secret. We were divided up into groups of 10 or so with our guide, Alfredo. We were all (mandatory) told to shower, to help remove oils, and then fitted with a wetsuite, water shoes and a hard hat with headlight (flashlight). Once ready we hiked down and observed an Elder performing a ceremonial blessing for our journey. Then the fun really started. We hiked down into the caves, some ground was dry, most was ankle deep, some was waist deep. Being a non swimmer I was uncomfortable with the part that we had to float in. The life vest and Alfredo's help and understanding allowed me to get through it. The hour and a half tour was phenomenal! Alfredo explained it was discovered by the property owner 6 years ago, took 3 years to map out and get ready for tours, so now they have been in business 3 years. A true hidden jewel. Long story short, we had a lunch buffet type meal waiting after we were done. Even being a non swimmer, I would definately do this again if we are ever in Cancun area again. A must see attraction!"

My husband and son really like caves (they have gone in to quite a few over the globe) and we had read in the Houston Chronicle that Rio Secreto was a do not miss if you were in this part of Mexico. One of the things mentioned in the article was that many of these diving/Cenotes palces only give a person 5 to 10 minutes exploring but at Rio Secreto you get a full hour and a half (with a guide naturally), which my son and husband got. When you arrive you get a safety lecture and all of that and put on snorkeling attire and a hard hat with a light on it. You still need to bring a swimsuit however. You then spend an hour and a half down there (inside two string lines and you are absolutely not allowed to touch the formations and ruin them-good for the owners) and they could not say enough good things about their day. This place is not all lite up and fake, it is the real deal. The also had an unexpected surprise when they got out of the cave and back to the meeting area, there was food ready for all of the adventurers. My husband said it was the best Tortilla Soup he has ever had and that is saying a lot as we live in the greater Houston Texas area and we never eat at chain Mexican places. One important tip would be to make advance reservations online or do it through your hotel as you cannot just go there and hope to get in."

We were told to be there for 8.30 as we had asked for the first time slot of 9am.This was truly amazing 9 miles of underground caves, which were found 3 years ago. Then a minivan took us deeper into the jungle for about 15 minutes on an unmade road. We were lucky enough to see a rare sighting of a deer, the guide was excited she had never seen one here. We put on wet suites and shoes and helmets with torches and showered. The guide Paulina took 12 of us through the Jungle to a hole and down we went. We had an hour and a half walking and swimming in half a mile of caves. This natural phenomenon was just incredible. Some of the caves were massive and some were just small and filled with stalactites and stalagmites which were just beautiful. Some places we had to squeeze through and be so careful not to touch or bang our heads and break anything. We saw a couple of large stalactites that had fallen down. We also saw in a couple of places some tree roots that had drilled down for the water. The oil from our hands our skin can damage the fragile system, so we tried to be so careful not. The floors were not flat so we had really watch where were walking or swimming and it was great to just stop and stare at this amazing world. We saw one spider and a few Cat fish. At one point in a small cave we all floated in the water and turned all the torches off. For two minutes we just lay in the dark and listened to nothing. One of the men had a walking stick and you could hear it was hollow underneath us and there was another cave system under us. At one cave there was a large hole and you could see the caves lower down. The water was just so clear. It was just magical in there when we came out we felt so alive we just wanted to pay again and go back down. There was a young man following us about taking photos, they sold us the CD after After we got our clothes from the lockers and used their towels to dry they then supplied a lunch whilst they developed pictures. The pictures came out really well."

The ferry from Cozumel was rough, but no one lost their breakfast thanks to modern meds. From there, it is about 15 minutes to the entrance, followed by a very rugged 15 minute ride to the opening of the cave. The rugged ride adds to the authentic nature of the experience, so here's hoping they never pave it. Our family of five was placed with two couples for our trip into the cave. They provided the water shoes, wet suits, helmets, along with some instructions. Our guide Pauline was fabulous and took special care of one of the members in our group who had a harder time getting around. Rather than describe the cave experience, we hope you decide to do it yourselves. After the cave experience (which takes about 90 minutes), we were treated to a shot of a local specialty and a nice buffet lunch (which they call a snack). The entire experience was well worth the money. Made it back the ferry in Playa del Carment just in time for the \"early\" ferry back to the \"other\" pier in Cozumel and then $11 cab ride got us back to the International Pier in Cozumel."

No artificial lighting added for effect here. They provide wetsuits, helmets with head lamps, water shoes, and life jackets. You can bring your own water shoes if you want.After walking about 5 minutes through the jungle, you enter the cave and the tour begins. You walk and swim (with arms only) through the cave for about 90 minutes, and then have a great lunch. The water is 'fresh' (cool), but we got used to it since you're walking in it when you're not swimming it it. Our guide was Jean Paul. He was knowledgeable, fun, and helpful. You can't take your camera, but they have photographers throughout the cave to take pics of you and your group. You can buy them at the end of the tour.Tips: 1. If you get motion sickness, take something before you get there because the 20 minute ride from the reception to the cave is rough.2. Watch your step because path is rocky (and can be slick). Also, there are lots of rough/rocky areas under water that may be difficult to see. The close supervision and instruction of the guides are helpful here.3. If you think you'll need it, ask for a walking stick when you get your wetsuit and life jacket. Great for balance on the path and in the cave. Also good for those with weak knees.4.

Our tour guide's name was Pablo and he had such obvious respect and love for the place that it really rubbed off. They provided a free lunch afterwards which was a nice surprise - we didn't know it was included.

Our guide was Alfredo, he was funny, very patient and professional. Alfredo took the time to point out special things like the blind cat fish, crickets, bats and other things that make Rio Secreto beautiful. If you are in Playa del Carmen or Cancun, I definitely recommend you go to Rio Secreto. They pick you up at your hotel and provide all you need, just bring a bathing suit. They will take pictures and I suggest you get the Jumbo Packet, you will not be disappointed. This is a great experience!"

            "review": "Great experience with my 7 year old son. I think by now if you read any reviews you will realize something... you can't bring your camera. And honestly 49 out of 50 of us do not have good enough cameras nor the skills to capture ANY shots that are halfway decent in the caverns. The professional photos you see us posting show those caverns in a bright lit way that you can't see in reality. So I just wanted that out of the way. I'm not going to hope that people stop complaining, but seriously you'll be fine with just a few professional pics or only your memories! Past that, here was our experience: I booked online without transportation as we were staying in PDC. My hotel misinformed me on using collectivos (I swear I thought they were getting kickbacks from the taxis). You can take a taxi from a hotel in the downtown area for around 130 pesos plus tip to Rio Secreto. Or you can walk to 2nd and 10th, find a collectivo and spend about 15 pesos pp and get there pretty fast too. The Rio Secreto stop is right past the Xcaret turn off the highway heading south from PDC. It's clearly marked and any collectivo heading south will know it/ see it. Also collectivos will stop anywhere on the way. So you CAN get there using a collectivo, although I unfortunately followed my hotel's instructions and took a cab. For the return we ran across the highway (there is no stop heading back north towards PDC) and flagged a collectivo down. This is what Rio Secreto told me to do (they'll also call you a cab). The area you arrive at has a small parking lot for travelers with wheels. If you purchase online, bring your printed receipt. I had no issues with check-in. My son and I were issued wristbands and brought a waiting area that was outside. They offered water to those who were waiting and there swings. Vans arrive and you take a 30 min bumpy ride through the jungle to where the real action is. When you get out you meet your guide (we were divided by language). They take you to a locker/ bathroom/ changing area. The lockers are free/ included. You strip to your swimsuit (that you should wear there) and shower outside. Then you are given shoes to wear (water shoes). You cannot wear ANY jewelry. You walk over to another little building to get your shorty wet suit and helmet with light attached. Layered on over that is a lovely life jacket. After 1 group pic, you head down the jungle path to the caverns. We stopped first to receive a blessing from a Mayan shaman before entering the cave. It involves incense and simply respecting the culture. After you descend slippery stairs the real tour (about an hour and a half) starts. Many parts involve treading shallow cold water and walking on very uneven ground. You also walk through water that's about ankle high--but that means you can't see where your stepping after the first person moves the silt and steps there. You need decent balance and the ability to crouch. The coldness of the water was more an issue for my son and a few others in our group than anything. I was fine with 72*F, but others are not. Our guide was very informative and very interesting. He was passionate about the cenotes and caverns. There is also a really low tight tunnel you wade through--if you have claustrophobia or a fear of darkness, then this is not the tour for you. They give you moments to ponder in absolute silence and darkness the wonder of the nature and profound blessing it is to be inside the earth without any modern distractions or noises. Twice we turned off our lamps and just listened to silence. It was awesome. The guide was also awesome with my son--he frequently towed him in the water and had him follow right behind him. I was very impressed. He kept insisting he take my son so I could also enjoy the caverns. We did stop for photos at a few key places. And I was happy to do so. It didn't take a lot of time. There were only 8 of us. After we came out we strip off the gear and they hand out towels. We walked up wear we had a toast of Mayan moonshine tequila (your guide and my child get tea), After that we were shown our picture options. I chose for $25 to get 1 pic and it is your choice to get it printed as an 8x10 or on a disc. I chose on a disc. You can get all the pics for like $69 and you can add on prints and t-shorts an alcohol starting at like $99 to $200. When you first arrive, they have a noticeboard letting you know that at least half the proceeds from the picture sales goes to the preservation of the land there. As I stated at first, you can't get decent pics anyways with your own camera--flash or not. Our camera guy took photos of each of us and would retake if someone moved, etc. He was also there for safety. Each pic he took with his camera took 12x longer than my point and shoot because the camera was absorbing light for the picture (I can't really remember my freshmen photography class). So we got 1 pic pic for $25 for the memory and coolness of it and we weren't griping. Of the 8 of us, my son and I and a British couple bought 1 pic, the French Canadians bought a disc of pics, and the Californian honeymooners bought nothing. so it's your choice. I did not feel pressured. After you are done looking at your pics (which you can skip if you like), you are brought back to your locker area where you give up your shoes, hit the bathroom, and change into your dry clothes. Then as a group we were led to the snack area (a place to wait really for vans to come up). They had juices, water, chips and cheese, salads, salsas, and bean empanadas complimentary. They offered quesadillas for a few dollars. We ate what was free and were fine until we made it back. They ask you while you are snacking/ eating (many Americans will call it a snack and some Europeans will call it a meal if I'm permitted to use a generalization. I KNOW it is a generalization) to fill out a questionnaire regarding your experience. Everyone I saw marked the guide, service, and caverns as awesome and the transportation in the middle. (barring a better road, they really can't make it better) This is also where your guide will probably say \"If you'd like to leave me something extra, this is the time to do so\". He says that because this is the last you see your guide. So we all tipped him as we handed back in our questionnaires. And I was happy to--he did great. After \"snacking\", you head straight back on the van to be driven down to the entrance. Extra advice: do not put on any lotions, creams, repellents, sunscreen before your tour, but afterwards while you are in the shade I would bring some repellent to put on to keep the mosquitoes at bay. We really enjoyed our trip into the underworld beneath the Mayan jungle and feel the tour was very well-run."

I've never seen anything quite so mysterious and beautiful! Rio Secreto should be listed as another wonder of the world! We walked, crawled, swam and shimmied our way thru a half-mile loop of a breathtaking 8-mile cave (and yes, there were bats!) Our tour guide (Alfredo) is super passionate about his work, and filled our tour with education and fun. I have a 29-year old daughter with Cerebral Palsy. Physically she's highly functional, mentally she's about 13. Alfredo took great care with her, both physically and intillectually. He safely guided her thru every step, and held her on a flotation device thru the swimming spots. He made sure she understood everything from instructions to education, to guarantee her the same WOW experience the rest of us received! He was truly outstanding! His passion tripled the pleasure of this event! This was the journey of my life, and I'll never forget it. Treat yourself to an amazing day! You'll be so glad you did!"

This was one of the best treks I have ever been on. Our guide, Lia was so helpfull and knowledgeable. It was obvious that the staff respects the natural environment and works to create not just an activity, but an experience. Felt very safe and taken care of.The river and caves were absolutely beautiful! It is all natural, no manmade trails or pools. I recommend taking the walking stick for balance as you cannot touch most of the structures inside the cave for balance.The swimming was, for me the best part...so calm and beautiful!I highly recommend this if you want an adventurous experience away from all the touristy park-type attractions."

            "review": "A singularly natural thrill in a region that overpackages nature. We visited Rio Secreto in early September 2011 after studying the brochure and asking around among other travelers. We had a sensational morning -- one of the highlights of a family vacation for our kids and us alike.My wife and I have been regular visitors to the Riviera Maya over the last ten years, and have had a lot of wonderful experiences in and on the water, in the towns, and visiting the historic ruins. One thing we have avoided like the plague is the so-called \"nature parks\" like Xelha and Xcaret, which have only a little more in common with nature than a day in Disneyland. I don't doubt they're fun if you like that kind of thing, but we'd rather snorkel or kayak through the mangroves than drive an ATV or ride a zipline. As such, we were really encouraged by the description of Rio Secreto, which claims to be a truly natural attraction, in harmony with its surroundings. For once, the brochure told the truth.Rio Secreto is a large natural cave system running through the limestone substrate of the jungle, only discovered about five years ago. It is on private land owned and managed by an indigenous tribe, and the stewards seem very sincere in their desire to bring in guests while respecting the delicate environment. Five stars to them! Your journey starts from a new 'base camp' right off the main highway, with a friendly welcome by hostesses and a video presentation. You board passenger vans for the very-rough-road drive back into the jungle, maybe about 20 minutes, and a bit queasy-making if you're prone to motion sickness. When you arrive at the cave entrance, you are paired with a guide, who oversees your outfitting after a mandatory shower (you're going down into an underground river with pristine waters -- you HAVE to wash off all sunscreen, lotions, bug spray, etc.). You're given a caving helmet with lamp, wetsuit, personal floatation device, and watershoes. You take a short -- maybe five minute -- walk along a jungle path to the cave entrance, where the adventure really begins.You need to know, this is a wild ecosystem, and you'll be walking, shuffling, squatting, and swimming your way through a cave. There are no boardwalks. The surface is rough and slippery in places. You have to squeeze (a little) through narrow passages to avoid damaging the cave walls. It's a little bit of work. And in exchange, you get to see some breathtaking sights... lovely stalactites, \"flows\" of limestone, beautiful, crystal-clear pools. It was a very real version of what you \"experience\" as you go through wild rides like \"Indiana Jones\" at Disney parks... except instead of being strapped into a bucking ride, you're swimming through peaceful waters and experiencing utter silence and true darkness.Our guide, Pablo, was sensational -- funny, soft-spoken, extremely well informed, and sincerely reverent about the beauty and meaning of the cave and ecosystem. He made sure we were comfortable and safe, and gently drew us into his view of the world and of Mayan beliefs. It really was a bit of a spiritual awakening.Rio Secreto was a great experience -- one of the highlights of our vacation -- and wonderfully in line with our personal philosophy of respecting and enjoying nature, rather than packaging it for mass-market sensibilities. Strongly recommended for able-bodied travelers who want to experience a true adventure and feel close to nature (and maybe something larger)."

Be sure and ask for Rene, who was our tour guide, he was absolutely wonderful--he was a good guide, thoughtful, knowledgeable, paid attention to each visitor when we were traversing through tighter areas, and was also quite a good sport and had a great sense of humor. The tour was absolutely amazing--the caverns are incredible, the stalagmites and stalagtites are gorgeous, especially when you're able to get so close. It's absolutely beautiful, the water is clear, you'll see a dozen caverns, and even a few fauna. We took the 1 1/2 hour, small group tour which took us through about 1 km of the underground caverns, which involved some degree of swimming, a bit of wading through water, occasional crouching, and a bulk of it walking. You'll have a wetsuit (the water's about 75 degree's) and a lifevest, so swimming is fairly easy, but you will need to know a modicum of swimming. Overall, it was the highlight of our trip, and we'd recommend anyone thinking about going to go, unless swimming or claustrophobia are issues. Apparently there are longer tours (up to 6 hours,) which we're quite intrigued by. And ask for Rene!"

My Wife was a little hesitant to try this because she gets claustrophobic, but she loved it. Our tour guide was fantastic, very knowledgeable and very enthusiastic. The caves are so beautiful, we had never seen stalagmites and stalactites before and they are awesome. You can wear a wet suit if you want because the water is cold; however you soon get used to it. In some places the water is just ankle deep and in others it reaches to your chest, but you never need to go under the water. They give you a hard hat to wear complete with a built in flashlight. In some places you have to watch your head does not bump off the ceiling or off a stalactite. The whole cave system is amazing to experience. However the best part for us was when they asked us to turn off the lights and just lay still in the water in complete blackness and silence. It was an incredible and peaceful feeling. The only disappointment with the trip was that they would not allow us to take our own cameras into the cave system. They have their own photographer who takes your pictures, both individual and group shots. Then when you\u2019re done with the tour they want to charge you a ridiculous amount for the pictures. I think one digital picture was $25.00. We felt this was a complete rip off and we were not very happy. But apart from the photos if you are travelling to the Mayan Riviera Rio Secreto is something you must experience for yourself."

From first contact all the way until we finished this was absolutely top notch!> We arrived not knowing we should have a reservation and they made arrangements for us to go. We were transported in an Air Condition Van a few miles deep into a wooden area where we arrived at the site. Our group consisted or about 10 people all speaking Spanish except my wife and I. Our guide \"Felipe\" was very patient to translate everything to us in English so we understood.  The Tour- Everyone was fitted with wetsuits, life vest, water shoes, and Helmets with lights then a short walk took us down a trail where we met a true mayan shaman. We were then told a little about the underworld we were about to embark on and a short prayer was said to bless us for safe passing. From this point on our journey underground began. You will be absolutely Amazed at how well protected and beautiful the underground cave is. We spent a lot of time traveling through water and around the natural beauty of the cave all while our guide told us about different areas of the cave and what we were looking at. All questions asked were answered with great understanding as our bilingual tour guide kept everyone informed in both Spanish and English. You will go from water just at your ankles to well over your head as you move throughout the cave. We experienced the sight of small Catfish, very tiny shrimp and bats.  This experience was so great that we're going back next year to take our two boys ages 10-13. In my opinion this would be great for ALL ages. Our tour guide said the oldest person he had the pleasure to show the cave to was a 90 year old person. You will need to be in decent shape and not afraid of small places. If my 100lb wife could do it you can too. Towards the end- Once we emerged back to topside from the cave we were taken back to the changing area where we freshed up to then find out we would be having lunch with our tour guide there on site. We ate a great lunch that was well prepared before relaxing a few minutes in the hammocks before being transported back out from the forest to the initial site where we first found Rio Secreto.In closing We live in Maryland and this was our first trip to the area. We are already making plans to go back and specifically Rio Secreto. They have really done a top notch job or making sure you get the best experience and without breaking your wallet. Plan to spend a few hours meet their friendly black/grey cat at the waiting area before getting transported back and don't worry about what to bring they provide everything including a locker for your belongings while your down in the cave."

We opted out of going of xcaret of xplor initially as it seemed over the top and way too commercial. I also questioned the environmental impact of such theme parks. I had read about Rio Secreto through several sites and kept it as an option. But when our snorkeling tour got canceled due to bad weather at the last minute, Rio Secreto became the best option. They had last minute availability so we decided to go for it.I was suprised at the fancy digs and waiting room upon arrival. And even more surprised at the hi tech picture viewing room they force you into when the tour is over. I asked if I could go to the bathroom and the tour guide said I could go but one of us (my boyfriend) had to stay and wait for the picture rep. What am I on a field trip?! We waited for the previous group to see their pictures before they let us in and then talked to each couple individually about the package options. It felt like a timeshare presentation. And the packages were so ridiculous in their offerings that you were left with no choice but to do all or nothing. Buy the entire CD with your pictures and their gallery for $69 or buy one picture for $25. The CD's are carefully crafted so you can't split the cost with another couple since they only have shots of yourself and a few group ones. As I look back I am even more turned off about the whole experience. They don't allow cameras of any sort, make you walk in single file the entire time, and have lights carefully positioned in certain places for shots just so they can get you at the end. The worst thing is that I bought the CD and you can't even copy the pictures or upload to any picture sharing sites. Isn't that the reason you want the pictures to begin with? What's the point of having the CD laying around the house? I was so upset it prompted me to write this review so others are aware. This place is completely commercial and if you are expecting anything special, DONT! The worst thing is they claim they have to charge such high prices to prevent the government from taking the land. Weather that's true or not, I don't know. Just seemed suspicious that they have such a high tech space in the middle of the jungle and have branded everything down to the warning stickers in their van with \"Rio Secreto\". Yes, the stickers in the van that pointed to the first aid kit, fire extiguisher, and windows all had their logo. Seemed a bit over the top.The actual tour was just ok. It was shorter than I thought and it felt somewhat rushed. When all is said and done you are only down there about 1.5hrs even though the whole excursion is 3.5. They fed us tortilla chips with processed nacho cheese and beans. If you want a quesadilla you have to pay extra. For $70 they could have at least fed us a real lunch. Oh and they tell you you are not allowed to touch anything and stay on the trail to preserve the place. Yet the photographer is free to run around and climb the colums as long as he gets the shot."

It was beautiful! We went in a small group that was warm and friendly, the staff was great! Our guide Alfredo did a wonderful job, it was easy to see he loves what he does each day! I would suggest this for your visit! It is a bit physical but they go slow and remind you to walk with confidence and take your time! Hope you have as much fun as I did!"

The staff does an excellent job in preserving the cave - you are required to take a shower prior to putting on your wetsuit and life jacket and heading into the cavern system. No hokey colored lights and our guide, Mau was outstanding! He explained to the non cavers about the importance of not touching the formations and demostrated a true love of the underground. A cave photographer followed us in and took some beautiful photos of us. After the trip, we were treated to a wonderful snack (heck, it was a meal) and we were hungry!"

Three not-so-fit mature ladies from NYC visited the underground river and caves with our kind, patient and oh-so-careful guide - Senor Alfredo. When we booked the trip, we had been told there were few stairs and the excursion could easily be done by older knees/hips as well as very rudimentary swimmers. Alfredo guided us, slowly, step-by-step, alerting us when there were sharp rocks to either side of us. He told us \"lift your knees with confidence!\" (it was his mantra!) and he helped us enjoy a truly challenging 2 hour underground trek. A mom, dad and their two young boys (from London) were in our group and they had a much easier time of it than we three - the kids got a big kick out of the bats, the catfish, and the nearly invisible shrimp in the river. Life jackets, water shoes and helmets required - wet suits optional (all provided by the preserve)."

I grew up in the mountains of Colorado and caving was one of my favorite activities- in fact, my brother and I would scour the hills and try to find unscouted caves in addition to the ones that were on maps. Rio Secreto was incredible and likely the best caving experience I've ever had the fortune to enjoy. The natural beauty of the cave with its formations, fossils, water system, mayan archaeological remains are part one to the formula- incredible guides and a well run company are the second. It was the highlight of our trip to the Riviera Maya- kids, adults, cavers and non-cavers alike. We had our kids- ages 10-12 along and they were able to do the experience as well and also claimed it as their highlight."

            "review": "This Cave is alive!. Having explored a good number of sizeable caves in Colorado, Rio Secreto goes down in my book as the most amazing cave I have ever experienced. This cave is bursting with life... full of more stalactites, stalagmites, columns, heliotites (sp.?), flowstone, and crystal clear water than my mind could take in. Many people think of caves as dark places underground where most living creatures avoid. We had the pleasure of observing cave crickets, bats, catfish, fresh water shrimp, and other fascinating creatures of the underworld, not to mention the ancient fossils and evidence of the Mayans. This experience was by far the highlight of my entire trip to the Riviera Maya. I appreciate how the staff at Rio Secreto seeks to conserve these wonderful places and create an unforgettable, safe, nature experience for anyone willing to take the plunge.-Ryan Stowell"

You walk through majority of the caves, about 1/3 is water that you can actually swim in. that was our major disappointment. We thought most of it was swimming from the brochures. The guides go a little too fast. 1 1/2hr tour. As you are walking on uneven ground in the dark, your eyes are focused on the ground ahead of you, so you're missing the views. need to slow it down a bit.excursion included \"snack\" which consisted of fruit and natcho's with cheese. you CAN purchase additional food. not impressed with \"snack\"no cameras but they do sell you cd pictures, naturallyoverall give it a thumbs up!"

However, from the moment we were picked up by the tour company in Playa del Carmen, all the way through to the end, I had a great experience. Our tour was Alfredo and you could tell in the way in which he explained the history and different caves we explored, the love he has for what he does. We were all very impressed with our tour and recommend anyone who is visiting to take the time to visit Rio Secreto. It's not going to be a secret much longer, so go soon!Be ready for some cool water, but they have great gear to protect you from that."

            "review": "Pretty Terrific and good for all ages. So my husband-to-be (who is claustrophobic) suggested that we go into a cave on our carribean honeymoon and I said \"What? The last place I want to be is a dark, damp cave while in the Carribean\". He then insisted that the reviews of this little known treasure on Trip Advisor were great. Well, after going, I had to admit for the first (of many) times I would have to admit that he was right. First of all, by the time our trip to Rio Secreto had arrived, we were looking for a morning break from the sun. As this trip was 10 minutes from our hotel (literally right outside of Playa del Carmen), it was very convenient to get to. Additionally, as the whole tour was only about 2 hours, it did not eat up too much of our day so that we were free to get back to lounging on the beach sipping cocktails after we were done. The cave was amazing, the water was awesome (so pure that the salt from your skin divided the salt in the water) and our guide was phenominal and so knowledgeable about the archelogical as well as practical facts about the cave. Just have to give a shout out to the reviewer who suggested buying the print package and sharing with someone as it made the prints so much more affordable. The downfall is that the person buying the prints after the fact gets all of the group shots, extra pictures and then the individual shots only of the person who actually paid. Thus, factor this in when deciding how to split the cost. When we realized we felt bad at first, but then realized that we gave the rest of the group a free lift back to their hotel, so it saved them a $20 cab fare in any event. As to restrictions you should be aware of, they recommend that anyone with bad knees or ashtma not go in. Now, I have bad knees and slight asthma, and did not have any problems, but be mindful of this with regard your group's limitations. Additionally, age wise, I would recommend anyone over the age of 7 yrs old who is in good physical shape. There is a lot of squatting and some tight spaces. Our group had 3 teenagers, a middle aged woman, my husband and myself, and, once you got the hang of things, no one seemed to have a problem. One critique, though, is that the \"lunch\" they provided really left much to be desired. It was nachos and some fruit, and that was it. As I am lactose intolerant, I had a couple of chips and ate lunch when we returned to the hotel. They really should either make it more lunch-like or not advertise that they serve lunch at all as we decided not to eat breakfast to ensure that we did not have to take care of any \"business\" while in the cave and were ravenous by the time we got back to the hotel. One more note, please respect the rules regarding sunblock and bug spray. This is a pretty unique bit of nature that was only recently discovered and the foreign sprays really do affect the ecosystem there."

Our group had older adults who were a little slow but still able to do the tour. At the end they provided us with some nachos and juice, nice touch.One thing we were disappointed about was the fact that cameras are not allowed down in the caves. The photographer they send along with you takes some really nice pictures but they try to charge you $25 US for one print at the end! This is ridiculous! Not a single person in our group purchased a photo. If they lowered the price to $5-10 US I guarantee everyone would have bought at least one if not two. It's unfortunate that we do not have any pictures to keep our memory fresh.Overall, this was one of the best excursions we have been on!"

You get to see naturally made caves from underground rivers, swim in the water underground, learn about how the formations happened, and much more. Our tour guide was Victor who was very professional and nice. There is a professional photographer who takes photos of you through out your tour. The pictures are sold on a CD for $69, which is pricey but when will you ever have photos like this again? I'm not sure if you aren't allowed to take cameras but our guide instructed them to leave them in our locker. I have a waterproof digital so was tempted to bring it but I'm so glad I didn't. It would have taken away from the adventure. I would put this at the top of your list for activities while visiting Playa, Rivera Maya, or Tulum. Great time with spectactular scenery!"

I came upon this tour through trip advisor and read all the reviews and it seemed to me that everyone loved this cave experience, so we decided to join in and see what it is about. We loved everyone minute of it. First Id like to complement on everyone that works for Rio Secreto, they are extremely nice, attentive and knowledgeable about the underground water rivers. Benito, our tour guide made us feel very comfortable and relaxed.He knew all about the underground water system in the Yucatan Peninsula which is extremely important when taking on a tour like this.They pick you up from your hotel...this is a plus!!! You provide them with the time and they are there no minute later!! Upon arrival we were greeted and taken to the actual site where we needed to get ready for our adventure!!They then gave you all the necessary gear that you need like the wet suit, water shoes, and flash light helmet and towels We only had to bring our bathing suits. That was a big plus for us that we didn't have to purchase anything extra or lug anything around. Throughout the tour, Rio Secreto has provided your group with its own photographer capturing memorable moments within the cave. You are not allowed to bring your own cameras....its all natural!!! They do not want anything in the cave that can contaminate it.After, they provided us with a small lunch buffet and a nice shot of their homemade liquor...felt just right after the experience we just had!!! You have three different options of souvenir packages to choose from depending on what your budget it. They range from 25 dollars to 100 dollar package. You definitely want to bring something back with you, so bring some extra cash! Don't forget to tip you tour guide...they deserve it!!!!We left Rio Secreto with an experience we will never forget. This tour made our trip to Mexico even more amazing!!! We highly recommend Rio Secreto!!"

I really cant say one bad thing about this place. The guide was great and very knowledgable. As far as not bring cameras thats common sense if you've been to this tour. It is very important that you dont bring anything extra into the cave. You could accidently lose it and it can offset the environment. They even make you take a quick shower in your bathing suit before you set off to go down into the caves. This was such an awesome trip. After a 15 minute ride through the jungle you get to the area where you change and get geared up to go into the cave. Then you walk through the jungle 5-10 minutes to the caves. Right before you enter the caves you receive a mayan blessing (small cermony) which was awesome. Then off to the caves. You are walking on and off down there about 45 minutes and swimming about 10 minutes if that. It really is beautiful down there. I really love it. Then a short walk back through the jungle. The pictures are 69 for the cd or 25 each. We didnt purchase them but we may of gotten one if ours came out. Any how if you are thinking of this tour do it! its worth every penny!"

You are not allowed to bring anything on the tour so they have a photographer follow your group around and you can purchase the pictures at the end (a little expensive but they are worth it).

We were on a cruise that stopped in Cancun and while most people spent the entire layover drinking at Senor Frogs, we took the ferry over to the main land to Playa Del Carmen. We weren't sure which activity we wanted to do but I'm so glad we chose this one. As many have said it starts with an unbelievably bumpy, long van ride through the jungle. Not the most comfortable trip, but it was amazing at how long we kept driving and all we could see was jungle around us. Once there you get your wetsuit, life vest, helmet and water shoes. Once your in this very flattering outfit you head to the mouth of the cave. Then it's an hour and a half to two hour adventure through this unbelievable sanctuary. I'd been caving once before, but I liked this experience much better. The fact that you're going through a river makes it more fun somehow and adds to the colors. At a few points the water was deep enough that we had to swim, but it's mostly wading. I can sometimes have issues with claustrophobia and the movies where people are trapped in the caves terrify me, but I never once felt uncomfortable while in the caves. Afterwards they have some side dishes for you to eat and quesadillas that you can purchase for like $5, which I definitely recommend, they were delicious. Pablo was our guide. He was the absolute best!!! He changed my perspective on life a little bit. Before we went in he told us to leave all our worries about work and school and whatever behind in the outside world, and just enjoy being in the now in the beautiful caves. And we did, and it was so refreshing and uplifting and it stayed with me even after I left. They take some photos of your group at a couple points in the caves and everyone asked Pablo to be in their pictures. On the way back, he told us a little about his story and how he ended up working there. And hearing how much he loved his job and where he lived really inspired me to try for what I really want. Sidenote: We were on the Carnival Cruise, and picked this out of their booklet of activities. Some of them are way overpriced (don't do parasailing, you can find it cheaper on your own), but this one was great. It was $100 and it included the ferry ride from Cancun to the mainland, which was a gorgeous trip on its own, transportation to the activity, and then the expedition itself. We also had about an hour after getting back from the caves to explore Playa Del Carmen or go to the beach there before getting the ferry back to Cancun. And we still had a little time to see Cancun too."

There we were introduced to our guide Dante. Dante live eats and breaths the caves. Which made him an absolutely stellar guide. He made what would appear to anyone watching the discovery channel dangerous, treacherous or scary into one of the coolest experiences of my life.

The experienced guide explains the formation of the stalagmites and stalactites, the kinds of animals that live within the cave, etc. A photographer snaps pictures in various locations for optional purchase before leaving the grounds. This was a wonderful tour - not for kids under 12, I would say - that requires some flexibility in movement - crouching, stepping on slippery rocks, swimming - all without touching the stalagmites/stalactites. Some passageways were a bit narrow. The only thing that marred this tour was the push to purchase expensive photos - which of course, thankfully, you do not have to.

It was very informative and quite an experience - I never thought I'd go spalunking!Our guide was really good - very knowledgeable and friendly.Having the professional photographer follow you around to take pictures was also a nice addition (you aren't allowed to bring ANYTHING on the tour with you - including a waterproof camera). The CD was expensive though (especially compared to other tours we took on the same trip) and we only bought one shot of us in the cenotes. But its a great one!Just a suggestion - there are several different tours around Mexico that will take you down to underground cenotes so make sure you don't book the same thing twice. We did a full-day tour a few days later and did another cenote tour (not as involved but very similar). 2 notes...they do provide you with everything you need for the trek - including watershoes. You have to leave everything behind - jewellery, wallet, cameras, etc...and they provide a locker with a key for each person. BUT each key opens all the locks - we had no problems but I'm glad I hadn't brought anything valuable. Second - the food that was provided at the end of the tour wasn't very good so bring your own or eat when you get back to your hotel!"

If you are in the Cancun or Playa del Carmen area of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, take the time to visit Rio Secreto. Forget about the beaches, the pools, the paragliding and all the other myriad of day activities offered in the area and spend a couple of hours walking half submerged through the caves and caverns of Rio Secreto. Ask for Adriana as a guide and you will get a heartfelt and sincere guide who clearly enjoys what she is doing and this is reflected in the way she expresses and conducts her tours. For an area of Mexico that is mostly known for its beaches, water sports and nightlife, this is a great change of pace and certainly worth doing. As the attraction offers several routes, it can certainly be visited more than once and the next time I am in the area, I will go back.Also keep in mind that this is a tourist attraction, they will try to sell you a souvenir CD with pictures (taken at selected locations during the tour) at the end of the journey (no personal cameras or camcorders are allowed inside). Included in the price of admission is a snack and they will pick you up and take you back to your hotel as far as Cancun (about 1hr by car) which makes the journey even easier."

            "review": "terrific experience. There are a variety of amazing sites and attractions along the Mexican Yucatan, and on a vacation of a limited duration, you need to choose them wisely. Rio Secreto is a fantastic experience and one which I highly recommend to folks who want an uncrowded, non-touristy natural adventure. The beautiful underground cavern/river is inspiring, spectacular and in a fully natural state. The educational and adventurous tour is led with sensitivity and relaxation. The groups are small enough to feel personalized. My teenagers really liked it -- headlamps,dazzling formations, hiking, ducking through dripping stalagtites, swimming across crystalline pools, and more. The post-tour liquer drink and the fruit and chip snacks were nice, as were the fresh showers and the lockers. If you are tired of bustling ziplines, crowded cenotes, and touristy Xcaret, then put this at the top of your list. My only issue is the one others mention -- you cannot take your own camera inside the cavern. However, I do feel that the tour would probably be really obnoxious with constant picture taking by every group member -- and their photos would likely turn out poorly anyway given the difficult lighting down there. In this respect, the professional photographer on the tour is probably the best compromise. Just buy the picture CD and consider that to be part of your admission price. The professional pictures look really good (although I would have liked the guy to have taken more than one shot of each setting.) Along with a full day with Edventures, a tour with Rio Secreto is an outstanding way to see some of best of the Yucatan."

I was hesitant to write a review for Rio Secreto because I would like it to remain a secret from the world. I am afraid if it gets too commercial the many visitors may have a negative impact on the pristine and preserved environment inside of the cave. If you do visit please be sure to not wear any sunblock, perfumes, or creams because the chemicals affect the organisms in the water inside the cave. I can't say enough about how much I learned with our guide, Dante. He was very knowledgeable and remembered all our names! I went with my teenage sister and 65 year old father,(Sergio) and both had an amazing time! We came back to the states with a new appreciation for what lies beneath the surface of the earth and even more respect for mother nature. I love it. All the guides are fluent in many languages so you will learn and have fun no matter where you travel from.Well worth it! Get the picture package. You will regret it if you don't. We did and they pics are very professional. It was a memorable experience.Thank you, Dante!!!"

It stands out as one of the highlights of our awesome 14-day cruise.We've been around the world and 'done' a few caves - Jenolan in the Blue Mountains, Australia and Cango Caves in South Africa come to mind immediately; this one goes over and beyond those great experiences!Rio Secreto is like a guided tour into the core of the earth where you encounter crystal clear water, dark caverns, awe-inspiring stalactites and stalagmites, underground vegetation and more... The tour begins with an ancient Myan invocation for a successful and safe journey, and togged in your wet-suit (optional), water shoes, life jackets and helmet with light, you begin your descent into a truly dark world with your cave explorer guide. You find your way gingerly through rocky terrain and ankle deep water in a single file, trying to keep your hands off the walls lest you mess with the natural formations. At various points your guide stops to display and explain the wonders of nature around you. You swim (or float!) through one long stretch and that is the best part of the entire experience. An accompanying photographer captures your expedition on camera.The underground part of the tour takes about 60 to 90 minutes, but you do not feel it. Would definitely not advise it if you have breathing problems or are not able to adjust to dark, damp conditions and walk uneven surfaces. We are not swimmers but had no problem with the life vests and the expert guidance of our guide Alfredo who was articulate, experienced and immensely helpful.You have lockers to leave your stuff, an on-site cafetaria with some great quesadillas and you can pick up your adventure pictures before you leave. Truly an experience ....... would highly recommend it for those who want to go off the beaten track!"

But once you get into the caves, you forget about all of that because it really is an amazing sight to see. the water is really clear, and the formations inside the caves were spectacular. I too was bummed out that i couldn't take my waterproof camera into the caves to take pictures, but once you get inside there, you realize that even with a professional grade flash, you would barely be able to capture what it looks like. Without flashlights, it's pitch black. we ended up buying the picture cd at the end of the tour for $69. we splitted it with another couple that we did the trip with so it wasn't so bad. the down side was that the lunch they serve is just nachos and fruit. wish it was something more substantial but you'd have to pay extra to get more stuff. overall it was a great experience and would definitely recommend to all."

The challenge of getting there from a ship was a little daunting so we let them guide us door to door. We started early on the ferry to the mainland. Sitting on the stern we had a wonderfully bumpy ride and chatted with David who is from Halifax. He was on this trip by himself as his wife was not really an underground secret river type person.Angel met us at Playa del Camon and our group of nine now boarded a van. It took us about 20 minutes to get out of town and then up a very bumpy road into the jungle. We were in introduced to our guide Gonzo and he outfitted us with wet suits, watershoes, helmets, and lights. He made us hit the washroom and have a shower. THIS TRIP WAS AWSOME!!!We started into the caves, (cenote) at times we were walking, wading, swimming and walking chest deep down the river. The sights were more than I really could imagine even having seen the photos ahead of time. We saw crab spiders, also know as whip spiders, bats and catfish. Gonzo was so excited to share his love of the cenote we were in you couldn't help but realize how lucky you were to have him as a guide and to have the honour of exploring the river. We were not to touch things, not to pee in the water, and no cameras. One area had the stalactites quite red/brown looking. That apparently was created by a fridge door being dumped on the jungle floor and left to rust.Two hours sped by and out we came for a light lunch and relaxing in the hammocks.Angel met us and back to Playa del Carmon where there was time for a wander though town and a dip in the water, Berfore we took the ferry arriving back on the ship at 4:50 with a departure at 5. We were fine with the photo cd and the cost was high, but the photos were great and it was something that I enjoyed completely."

            "review": "Amazing Experience with Some Tacky Issues. Let me first say, this is a must when visiting the area. I am so glad that we decided to visit Rio Secreto on our last day in Playa Del Carmen. The underground caves are absolutely stunning and amazing and when would you ever be able to do something like this again? It is simply breathtaking and worth the $59 for the guided tour. What is unnecessary about the tour are the constant stops to take pictures of each couple/group/family. During the tour you are followed by a photographer who makes you stop and pose in just about every cavern whether you like it or not. Not only do you stop and pose for pictures, but the photographer is also taking candids of you as you try and navigate the caves without touching anything and falling on your butt. To say it is annoying is an understatement. The reason for all the pictures is because they try and sell them to you for incredibility inflated prices at the end of the tour. No, I did not buy any pictures, but you do have a few months to purchase them through pay pal once you return from your trip or so they say. When I got home and tried to contact them to see the pictures so I could debate for a 2nd time if I wanted to purchase any, I was told that you first have to pay before even viewing them. Actually when I e-mailed them they did not even respond, but sent me a pay pal order form 3 times without ever allowing me to first view the pictures. The lunch you are promised after the tour is not a lunch, but simply a snack of chips and fruit. If you would like something more like a simple taco then you have to shell out more money. Also, I encourage you to tip your tour guild because they do an excellent job informing you on all the great aspects of the caves, but what I don't recommend is the staff asking you for a review of their services and a tip at the end of the tour while you are at the snack area. Tacky yes........"

We took the colectivo from our hotel (VIM)....well, we took a colectivo, got kicked out then took a cab the rest of the way. We still aren't sure what was going on with the colectivo getting pulled over and all the passengers getting kicked out, but we still made it for our tour on time. Back to the review... we were in a group of 10 - the max for a group. Alfredo was our guide and did a wonderful job!! Our tour lasted about 3 hours or so, but didn't feel like it at all. We could have stayed down there and explored much longer. We found out later that there is a longer \"VIP\" tour that we could take, but that one isn't advertised online. Our next time in the Riveria Maya, we'll definitely do that.You walk, wade, squat walk in some places and swim through this magnificent wonder. If you have knee problems, claustrophia or nyctophobia this may not be for you. If you can't swim, it's not a problem though. You are required to wear a life jacket the whole time. The life jackets are great. I couldn't sink if I wanted to! The snack at the end isn't all that great, but the quesadilla for purchase was good. It was $3 and a good size one. We got 2 cokes and a quesadilla for $7. I do think they should include just a little more for the snack, but the tour was worth it. We also bought the picture CD at the end for $69. We knew how much the CD was going to be and that we would want it so every opportunity we had we asked the photographer to take our picture.As others have mentioned in a few other reviews, expect a bumpy ride from the main gate to the cave staging area. They do pack you in the van, so be prepared to get cozy with strangers. :)"

We all enjoyed it immensely, including our one non-swimmer and two clausterphobia-prone individuals. There is no real swimming involved, only leisurely floating with heads out of the water in the life jacket they provide. The cave is hugh with high ceilings, so no one in our group felt closed in.The guide offered us walking sticks made of sturdy, yet lightweight, wood if we wanted them. All three females in our group opted for the walking sticks and were so glad we did. The walking sticks gave us some security as we navigated the uneven terrain in the cave which had no lighting except for our headlamps and guide's flashlight. The walking sticks were also good to stick down in the water to measure how deep the next step would be. I used the walking stick to \"feel\" my way through the underwater areas instead of leading with my shin. :)Regarding the photos at the end--I guess I have been on a few too many cruises to be shocked by the price of the professional photos. And at Rio Secreto you get an entire cd of pictures, not just one shot. The photographer uses a large flash so the pictures have enough light. We loved having someone else take the pictures so we could actually be in them together. It was also great to be able to focus on the beauty of the cave without worrying around with a camera. I have enjoyed showing off my incredible pictures since I have been home. Don't let a few dollars keep you from a wonderful keepsake of your cave experience.Rio Secreto is a gorgeous, living cave with unbelievable formations and beautiful water. I was awestruck thoughout the entire journey. Our guide, Karen, was enthusiastic and well informed. Overall, this is a not-to-be-missed experience.

Spend top dollar for a walking tour of pristine underground water caves of all the while suffering through the tour guide's endless harangues against wealth (the same wealth which is paying her salary).The tour guide informs you that humans are extraneous, people shouldn't be born. This is irksome when you are taking your own children at a cost of multiple hundreds of dollars on this tour.The tour guide naturally doesn't consider herself \"extra\" (after conversation) so the implication presumably is that you or your children are. The tour guide is opposed to tourism, considering it one more rape of the landscape and local populace. The tour guide opposes people's visiting the pristine cave, furthering despoiling of the environment.All this begging the question of why she is there and from whom her salary emanates. She has all the familiar Marxist rants, saying that \"rich people having too much money\" is evil and \"should have their money taken away to give to the poor\".She tried to show us the \"quiet\" of the cave, but only after 12 minutes of speech enforcing everyone's guilt at breathing and living.(except of course for herself, because she is one of the \"good people\").The tour guide is not native to the area, coming from middle class, middle-Mexico, with a college degree, and fashionable PC/socialist juvenile theories; yet of course she is not an interloper. This is particularly tiresome after the tour, she is effectively begging for her tip (interrupting our normal flow of conversation to repeatedly mention tipping practices after such a tour); all while pimping $60 photograph-CD's (we are not allowed to bring our own cameras on the tour). All to the good because we have \"redistributed\" our wealth to her own!Avoid this sanctimonious drivel, which ruins a beautiful cave."

You are in natural caverns and you do need to have good balance and stability as the areas are sometimes very narrow, uneven and slippery.

The only thing I would have changed was that our group of 6 English speaking people was put with 4 Spanish speaking people - so everyone had to listen to everything twice - making it a bit long. I could do away with the \"snack\" at the end also. But - be sure to buy the pictures, as you can't take your camera with you. The pictures are spectacular. The rental gear is in good shape - but we took our own water booties.

The caves are beautiful and the water filling them even more stunning. When inside the caves, you will feel like you're on the National Geographic Channel - it's that amazing! Your experience can really be enhanced with the right guide too. This excursion, however, is not an easy walk in the park. You are in a natural cave formation and you do need to have good balance and stability as the areas you will be walking in are sometimes very narrow, uneven and slippery. Plus, you need to be very careful how you walk and what you touch. The cave formations are extremely delicate, and touching them can easily break them off which can ruin the cave's beauty.When you arrive at Rio Secreto, you will take a 15-20 min. \"bus\" ride down a dirt road to the entrance of the caves. Once there, you will be fitted with swim shoes, a wet suit, life jacket and helmet (with head lamp). FYI - the caves are cool and so is the water that you will be swimming in. If you get cold easily, make sure you ask to wear the thicker wet suit that cuts off at the knees. They do have full body wet suits but the material is very thin and you could be feeling uncomfortably cold. With the shorter suite, you may knick your knees and get a couple scratches but I think that's better than freezing the whole time you're down there. Once you have all your gear, you will take a 3 minute walk down a jungle path and then some steps down into the cave. (You're not allowed to bring your camera or anything else into the cave!) Once inside, you will walk around the cave's formations and down specific paths and will eventually encounter water, then more water, then pretty deep water where you will need to swim. A photographer comes into the cave with everyone and they take several pictures which they charge big $$$ for you to buy if you want your picture after the tour. There are 2 tours available - the basic tour and the \"privilege\" tour. I have done both. With the basic tour, you're in the cave 1 1/2 to 2 hours. With the privilege tour, they take you very deep into the cave until you reach another end, where the cave collapsed, and sunlight comes through - you then take a slightly different route back and out. Altogether, this tour is approx. 5 hr. It may seem long, but honestly, the time went by so quickly because the caves and water are so stunningly beautiful and there's so much to look at. The privilege tour, is however, quite difficult and you have to be physically fit and flexible to maneuver around. Also, it's good if you're not too tall. My husband is 6 feet and he did ok, but much taller and limited flexibility, you're in trouble !! The reason I say this is because at one point, the roof comes down so low, you really only have approx. 1 to 1 1/2 feet of crawl space where everyone is literally dragging themselves on their stomachs in order to get through this area. Very challenging and difficult! Not to mention other areas of the cave where you have to get down on your knees and crawl your way through.You can expect to see bats, catfish, the odd bug and crab spiders while in the cave. While these things do live in the cave, they are now rarely spotted because so many visitors have frequented the caves, that these creatures do a really good job of hiding or have found another area of the cave to live in so as not to be disturbed.When my husband and I went on the Privilege tour, our guides were Aida and Inga. Both very sweet, friendly and had lots of knowledge about the caves. The only things we didn't like was that when we got to the collapse for a break, the two of them were smoking. For us, it was a real turn off considering we were in such raw beauty, and seeing the guides pollute this beauty with their cigarette smoking was disappointing. Also, we were quite hungry because the tour started at 10am and by the time we made it to the collapse it was already 1:40pm. The guides only had chocolate bars and fruit bars, which in my opinion, was not enough for \"lunch.\" We had a very hearty breakfast but because this tour is so physically exerting, we were quite hungry and were expecting at least sandwiches or cheese and crackers or beef jerky or something more substantial to eat so we could be properly re-fueled before heading back. FOR MANAGEMENT of RIO SECRETO -- If your guides are smokers, it really looks unprofessional for them to be smoking in front of paying customers. You should really have them wear the patch or chew nicorette gum or something while they are wokring. Also, the privilege tour is expensive. You should really pack a \"lunch\" for guests which should include sandwiches, cheese and crackers, celery sticks, beef jerky as well as chocolate and fruit bars. It's the least you can do to make the tour more enjoyable and comfortable - we are after all, paying a lot of money."

            "review": "hope you have a good memory, because you can't rely on the pictures. First off, we were told we were not allowed to bring our own underwater camera on the tour because we needed both hands - this was the first red flag. It has more to do with the fact that if you don't have your own pictures they can gouge you for their pictures at the end of the tour.The tour itself was ok, the tour guide was at least friendly and knowledgeable (the only reason I didn't give it a 1-star). If you're looking for excitement, this isn't it - think more discovery channel documentary in HD. What really left a bad taste in our mouth was the fact they wanted $70 for a CD with pictures of which 95% were pictures of us \"just walking\" from one location to another, now honestly what am i going to do with these. I asked how much it would be to have the two good pictures put on CD or printed out... $25 each picture. REALLY???? there were 6 of us on the tour and we wouldn't even split the cost 6 ways just on the principal. By the end of it we all felt like we just wasted a day in Mexico. I would not recommend this tour to others.On a side note we also did the the Jungle Maya Expedition through Alltournative. Now that was an excursion that made our trip! loads of fun, plus you can (and should) bring your own underwater camera. we got some amazing photos and we also bought the CD at the end (only $50) and that's because their pictures were amazing! so many shots we wouldn't have been able to get ourselves. that tour goes highly recommended."

Then we had a bumpy ride in a shuttle van out to the actual location of the underground river. We met our tour guide, Filipe, and he told us all about what to expect. Then we had to take quick showers and put on aqua socks, wet suits and helmets to prepare for our descent into the cave. That was the only bad part--the equipment had been worn a million times by a million different people, and they probably weren't cleaned very often. If you get the heebie jeebies from thinking about germs, you may want to skip this trip :)Anyway, then we walked as a group (there were 2 couples and a family of 5 in our group) to the cave entrance--about 5 minutes. We went in and got more instructions and information from Filipe, and then made our way through the cave. It was beautiful--but definitely not suitable for anyone with any sort of physical limitation. It was great to be in the water because we had worked up a sweat walking over there and through the cave.You are not allowed to take cameras into the cave, which everyone questioned, but you understand why once you start walking through. You need both hands for the entire length of the exploration. To deal with that, though, a professional photographer joins the group and stops to take posed pictures at predetermined locations throughout the cave. These photos are available for purchase once you get back above ground--but one photo was $25, so we skipped it. The quality wasn't all that great, and that's a really high price. After we got back and changed, we were given a light lunch of fruit and chips, with the option to purchase a quesadilla for $3. Then we were driven back to the home base. The entire experience probably took about 2 hours, not including the rides to and from Playa. To get back, we had to dash across the busy highway to stand and wait for the next colectivo. Fortunately, we didn't have to wait very long--we would have gotten way too hot because the waiting spot on the side of the road was right out in the bright sun. But all that was worth it because it was a fraction of the cost of a taxi. We each paid $59 for the adventure."

We knew it was a cave with water, but that was where our expectations ended. Our guide Juan helped us get our gear (wetsuit and water shoes, plus a hardhat with a light) and we were off!From the moment we stepped into the cave, we were amazed!! This is not a touristy cave attraction, it is a real cave and the only light is from your hat! We were partnered with one other couple a so it was a small group with only the lights from the helmuts and our guide's flashlight. Juan explained all about the cave and words cannot describe the beauty! The time flew by as we walked carefully, then swam through areas of the cave. He said we went about 900 meters (I think) into the cave and came out another entrance.We all loved the experience and the pictures. It is $69 for the disc with all of the professional pictures, which is a bargain compared to a lot of places I've travelled that charge $25/piece no matter how many pics you buy!Btw, we didn't take their transportation. We just hired a cab and he met us there after to take us back to our hotel...it was much cheaper and we didn't have to stop!"

One of the guests had significant knee problems and she made sure he was well taken care of. The pictures they offer at the end is well worth the cost ($50?).

It's a half day excursion, we got picked up from out hotel at 8 am, and got back at about 1 pm. The site is really close to playa del carmen, so not too long of a ride on the shuttle! I liked that it was a small tour group (8 of us in total plus the guide), makes the tour much more enjoyable! You get dropped off at their 'welcoming' area in which at that point they arrange their own ride to bring you into the actual site where you can enter down into the river. It's about a 10-15 min ride (a really bumpy ride because the roads aren't exactly perfect) into the actual site from the welcoming area.They provide you with the wet suits, water shoers, helmets, and life jackets. You just have to be dressed in your own swimsuit. Our guide was Alejandro/Alex, who was spectacular! Trilingual, so he can communicate in English, Spanish and French.You walk down to the openning of the cave, so it's not physically strenous.The water is refreshing, the wetsuits keep you comfortable in temperature though. They have a photographer who follows your group to take pictures for you through the excursion underground as you're not allowed to bring your own camera.If you have claustrophobia like myself, not to worry, the ceilings are very high, there's no squeezes that make you feel uncomfortable!The one thing that my boyfriend said was less enjoyable was the fact that you always had to keep your eyes on the ground. The ground is pretty uneven from the stalagmite formations, so you really have to be aware of where you're stepping on to avoid any falls or scratches to your legs! But it's all part of the beatiful nature of these caves.We were underground for about 1.5 hrs, and this intro tour takes you through approx. 600 meters of river.There's a longer tour, which is 4 hours, I would definitely return and take this one!They provide you with drinks and snacks afterwards as well.After you exit the cave, you're brought to the photo shop where they show you your photos. They even separate your (you and your party) photos form the rest of the group to save you the hassel of picking and choosing out your pictures.I got about 20-25 photos of me and my boyfriend, and of course group shots in total. The CD with all your digital prints is 59 or 69 USD (can't exactly remember now..)The excursion itself was only 89 USD per person which I think is well worth it to see mother nature at it's best!The staff were all great!"

Our guide Pablo was very informative about the geology and history of the cave and are, and seemed very passionate about the cave and its preservation.The tour itself is arduous, but not difficult, for active people. However, It goes about two hours, and you must be prepared to hike up and down some mildly difficult terrain, often on very slippery surfaces. Also, you will not be able to use the bathroom during the tour, so keep that in mind.You are not permitted to bring cameras, or any other foreign object into the system. On the one had they seem very serious about preservation and on the other they do need to make money to preserve the place. They take their own photos and allow you to purchase a full set on dish at the end. The pictures aren't cheap, but I thought they were worth it.All in all this was a fantastic and facinating adventure, but be prepared. This isn't something out of disney or an american theme park."

If you enjoy caves with lots of stalactites, stalagmites, and other formations, this is a stunning tour. You'll spend 1 1/2 hours underground, sometimes walking, sometimes swimming (more like floating, with an occasional dog paddle.) The cave is packed, end to end, with beautiful formations. Use the shoes and (short-sleeved) wet suits that they provide. Our guide, Alfredo, was great! Very warm, personable, and enthusiastic. Also very careful to look after his guests. My balance isn't the best, so he put me at the front of the group so that he could give me a hand over the rough spots. Yes, there are rough spots. They have kept the cave \"natural,\" without constructed walkways. You will have to take big steps up and down--sometimes in the water, where you can't see the floor very well. You will also have to cross brief stretches of sloping, uneven rock. Fortunately, the shoes grip very well. But, while trying to keep your balance, it's easy to whack a jagged stalactite with your hand or leg and get an abrasion. (We did.) I would recommend this tour ONLY for those who are reasonably limber and comfortable doing a bit of clambering up and down. One family brought their five- and seven-year-old children. They managed well and the kids seemed to enjoy the tour, but Mom and Dad did a bit of carrying, and the five-year-old was quite chilled by the end of the tour.The cave is in a nature reserve, and you will do a few minutes of strolling through the \"jungle,\" but that's not the highlight of the trip. It's all about the cave. They do provide a snack afterward.The only down side is a very bumpy 15 or 20-minute ride to the cave--in a van that may or may not be well air conditioned. But it was worth it!"

Pablo made the whole tour complete and helped us leave the area with the sense of awe you should have after being allowed to experience such a pristine part of our fabulous planet.

These caves are left as Natural as possible, which makes them very interesting to explore. For many of us, this will be as close to spelunking as we could ever get. That is a thrill in itself. We even say Jaguar paw prints!!! For those with ANY issues walking, keeping balance or fears of dark or closed spaces -- pick something else. You are constantly walking on VERY uneven, steeply sloping surfaces. At points your are simultaneously stepping over and under stalagmites and stalactites -- all while trying your best NOT to touch anything but the person in front of you. At points, you step into water..and sometimes you even swim. It is a unique adventure for those who are willing and able to enjoy it. We did!PHOTOGRAPHY - You cannot take your camera. Accept that now. There is a professional photographer with your group and you can buy a picture or a CD. At first, I thought that this was a money making scheme..and the pictures are too expensive. However, you cannot safely carry a camera through the caves. Even if you could, it is very dark. You will not get good pictures. Let the professional take your pictures and decide whether you wish to purchase any of them. GETTING THERE: This put a damper on the whole experience. You must take the ferry from Cozumel to the mainland. The ferry is ROUGH. The day we took it, it was VERY rough. The majority of the ferry passengers were seasick. Those who weren't still had to witness a lot of vomiting. Not a great way to start. Once in Playa Del Carmen, we had to wait another 20 minutes, then take vans another 30 minutes or so. The van was decent but very crowded. The first half the trip is on a highway, the last 15 to 20 minutes goes into the jungle. For those still trying to recover from the ferry, this was hell. While I do not suffer from seasickness, the journey was fine but not fun. After the tour, you have a little time in Playa Del Carmen. Then, we returned to the ship in time to depart. While I enjoyed the tour, it does take a whole day. If this is your first trip to Cozumel, you may want to consider whether you wish to spend a whole day on this type of excursion. If you frequent the area, this may be an interesting alternative to the norm."

            "review": "Most Awesome Excursion Yet!!!!. We visited the Amazing Secret River while on our Royal Caribbean cruise -- As noted in other reviews, this series of caves was only discovered about 5 years ago and only 10%Our guide was Eddy -- and he was nothing short of outstanding. has been opened up to the public in the last 2 years. Upon arrival at the location, you'll be given all the equipment you need (water shoes, wet suit, life jacket, and helmet with light). Although much cooler in the cave, you do tend to get warm hiking through the cave with the wetsuit and life jacket on. Once Eddy lead us to the cave entrace, he stopped to explain the layout. He was very proud of the site and rightfully so. The views inside the cave system were absolutely amazing. And the pictures that they provided ($59 for the CD), although a little overpriced, were absolutely beautiful!!! I disagree with one of the previous posts, you do not really need to know how to swim as the life vests are plenty for this trip. There are only about 2 places where the water is over your head. One person my group had been on nearly 10 cruises and said that this was the best excursion she'd ever been on! I can only say that, for me, this was an absolutely fantastic excursion that I would absolutely recommend to anyone!The down sides of the trip were the van ride to/from the site. Lunch provided was really just a snack - however, you could buy some food from the stand - they really had amazing chicken fajitas (very large) for only $3!"

We've enjoyed our fair share of great tours of many interesting places, but Rio Secreto, Amazing Secret River is at the top of our list, along with diving at the Great Barrier Reef. The cave and water are stunningly beautiful and Benito, our guide was informative and entertaining. He took great care of us. Every time I look at the photos (worth purchasing -- $60.00 for the CD) I want to go back! Also, chips and drinks are provided, but for just a few $$ you can get a delicious quesadilla so bring money. Lockers, towels, wet suits and water shoes are provided. Leave your jewelry at home."

            "review": "Absolutely breathtaking. One of the things I really wanted to see while in Mexico this time around were the cenotes. We heard about this one through our travel agent and booked it right away. We descended into the cenote with a group of people and were led by our guide, Adrianna (I think), who was just amazing. She was really passionate about the environment and the place in general. Inside was an eery kind of beauty that I have never experienced. It's actually indescribable. At one point, we turned off all the lights and were sitting in the dark. It was the loudest silence, and the most brilliant blackness I have ever encountered. Kind of like what I imagine outer space to be like.Now onto the details:- You are given a wet suit, hard hat with light, life vest (there are some areas where you can't reach the bottom) and water shoes for your journey- No cameras or anything else are allowed for the journey, even if they're waterproof. While you are walking around, there is a photographer who runs ahead (somewhere, somehow) and takes photos of you, there are some beautiful photo areas with lights set up. Personally, we found the photos too expensive ($20 for one, up to $120 for the whole shebang) so we left with our memories.- They seem to have different paths for different ages/abilities. We saw a group of seniors just back from their tour, and we definitely did not hear or encounter them when we were on our's.- After there is a complimentary snack area with fresh fruit, nachos and salsa. There is also a cash snack bar where you can buy pop and fresh made quesadillas. The quesadillas are very good, but you need to get to it right away, because you only have a small amount of time before the bus takes you back to your hotel.The trip was roughly $100 per person including a ride to/from, all rentals and the snack.It's definitely worth checking out."

We opted for just the tour and skipped the transportation which was an additional $30 per person round trip. The colectivo, which runs from Tulum to Playa Del Carmen, drops you off right in front of Rio Secreto. It is safe and easy to take and costs about $3. The cave itself was beautiful and a sight to be seen. Our tour guide Mauricio was knowledgeable and more than willing to answer any questions we had. From arriving at the sight to walking off the lot the entire thing took about 3.5 hours so we had plenty of time to do other activities that day."

As an added bonus, Karen entertained us with her knowledge of Spanish and French - she can do the entire tour in three languages! We ended the tour with surprisingly delicious food.

This was a great decision. From Cozumel you take a 45 minute ferry ride to Playa Del Carmen. From there you take a 15 minute extremely bumpy but fun van ride to the Secret River site. Once there you will meet your guide who will get you ready with water shoes, wetsuit, life vest and hardhat with light. They also provide towels to dry off afterward. Wear a swimsuit. They will make you rinse off before putting on wetsuit. They also provide lockers to keep your belongings while on the tour.The caves are breathtaking. The water was cool but not too cold for us. The wetsuits helped. You cannot bring your own camera but you need to have both hands free to manage the underground terrain. The stalagtites and stalagmites were incredible and we also saw the remains of a coral reef. At certain points the water is deep and you must swim, but you have a life jacket on. Our guide was excellent and there are photographers following your tour group to take your pictures which you can buy at the end of the tour. Individually they are $25 dollars a piece but we chose to buy the cd of all our pictures and they include many local nature pictures as well as pictures of the cave with this. This was $59 which we didn't think was too bad. After you have dried off and turned in your gear , they offer a small snack of nachos/ drink ( included), and there were enchiladas for sale as well as canned drinks. After that you can relax in a hammock unitl the van is ready to drive you back to Playa Del Carmen where you can spend a little time shopping before catching the ferry back to Cozumel."

You'll be a bit concerned as you start out traveling down a long and beat up road for a good 20 minutes or so. However, stuff like this scares away the crowds, so we took that as a good sign. You should know that you'll want to be in reasonably good shape for this tour. There is a fair amount of crouching and squeezing through tight spaces. You'll probably get a bit scratched up too, as the surface in the cave is very uneven and will be hard on your feet. The operators give you a wetsuit and some beat up water shoes, but I banged up my feet pretty well. One of the big advantages of this tour is your group will be small. Ours was 6 people, plus our guide and a photographer. This really keeps the cave from being beat up by large groups, and it allows you to have a better and more relaxed experience. Our guide was Fabio and he did a great job of taking us through the cave in a responsible manner. You'll learn that the cave is a very fragile resource and you'll need to take extra care to make sure you don't harm it. The operators of this tour make everyone take a shower before they go in to remove any lotion or oils that are on your skin. Also, great care is taken to make sure you won't touch any of the fragile formations in the cave, and they've done virtually no alterations to the cave (all the lighting is from handheld battery flashlights carried in, and the surface of the cave has not been altered to allow for people to move through with ease).Overall the tour operators do a great job and the experience exceeded our expectations."

The cave itself is spectacular (although the wet suits and soggy water shoes were a bit stinky) but the minute you get into the cave, you forget about that!

You are not allowed to take your cameras in for good reason - you need all your senses to walk/swim through these amazing caves. We did spend the $60 to get the DVD & it was worth every penny.

Angel & Lia just made the trip even more enjoyable with their personalities"

We liked that there hve been no lights strung through the system and we had to wear headlights.hopefully that won't change.PROS: Was breath taking and tour guide was helpful with information. Small group (not really small enough for us). For those who are a little concerned about swimming or having their head under water - you will have both a wetsuit and a life jacket . Juan was so considerate to the one lady that was concerned. He helped position her in an floating position on her back and helped guide her through the area. she did awesome!Snacks provided at the end and there are washrooms to use prior to and upon leaving the cenotes.CONS: You cannot take your own camera and although they say it is for safety reasons, I really question that ruse. They provide their own photographer who has a great camera. (We did not feel pressured into the purchase of these photos even though we did in the end buy them due to the quality and the fact that we wanted the moment memoralized).All in all - if you can get over the fact that lots of people show up and there is litle info while you are waiting, then you will be fine. the ride down the bumpy road in a crowded van should be lessened by the experience of the underground pleasure."

Our tourguide, Inga, saved the trip. with mixups, putting us with the wrong language group and disorganization at the entrance, we were initially put-off on this experience.however, inga really has a passion and lots of knowledge about the caves, the mayans, the area and nature. she made the trip worthwhile and helped me feel safe on a scary bucket list item of mine.It really is worth the trip-though if you are not physically fit or have very young children who cannot swim, it may not be for you.they were safe, concerned with preserving nature and at all times aware of all the travelers in our group. We definately all felt bonded after our experience together."

We chose it over snorkeling by the reef, and we were not disappointed. We toured underground caves that were decorated with intricate stalagmites and stalagtites, learning about everything from their history to their future to their chemical makeup. My family members and I had to depend on each other for balance and communicate clearly as we navigated the sudden dips and steps hidden in the dark. There was even a mystical element, if you enjoy meditation or imagination. Our guides, Adrienna and Alfredo, were fantastic, full of humor and knowledge. Afterwards, we were treated to a refreshing snack. Even my youngest brother, aged ten, appreciated this trip. I recommend it to anyone who has a passion for learning and time for entertainment."

            "review": "Unique and AMAZING. Our personal tour guide included a trip to Rio Secreto in our itinerary. We were not expecting such a great experience. After you have paid (a reasonable price for 3-4 hours they spend with you), you spend a few minutes in a hut with tv's, coffee, water and very friendly guides. You might even be visited by Philippa - a very friendly puppy! Once the guides give you the run-down on what will happen on your tour, you're whisked off in a van to the cave site. The ride is about 15 minutes long and very bumpy in the back of the van. Those who get the first tours in the morning might see monkeys, tucans and other jungle wildlife. Once at the cave site you will change into wetsuits, helmets and life jackets - lockers provided. Then you spend an incredible hour and a half in a stunning underground world. We were blown away by the beauty and the personal touches the guide and photographers offered us while on our tour (about 8 people). This is a fascinating place!!! After your incredible tour, you will be given a tasty shot of Yucatan liquor to warm your insides and celebrate the beauty of mother nature. Then you get to chose your photos if you wish to purchase (expensive but worth it if you just get them put on cd). After that you'll get a tasty snack and a few minutes to relax. We were very impressed with the concern for nature and preserving the site in its current state. Overall, this was something that is great for the whole family and is a one of a kind, incredible experience!"

            "review": "Rio Secreto should be at the top of the must see excursions.. If you are traveling to the Mayan Riviera this is a must see place. We were in awe at the beauty of this place and loved learning about the geology of the region. We were picked up at our hotel by a cargo van and driven to the entrance. From there we had a 20min van drive over rough dirt roads. Our driver did his best to miss the rough spots but as we ATV in northern Ontario it really wasn't that bad. Once we arrived at the change rooms we were given a lock for a locker to put our belongings into. We put on wet shoes, had a bit of a splash in an outdoor shower and then were given wet suit, life jacket (standard vest that really was not cumbersome) and a helmet with a headlamp. Walk to the entrance was maybe 5 min. The first half of the trip is mostly hiking through ankle or knee deep water. Our guide was terrific at explaining how stalagmites and stalactites are formed, the different types and how this affects the growth of flora and fauna above ground. The last half you do get into deeper water where you can swim in beautiful crystal clear water. All I can say is the cave views are amazing, cool, awesome..like nothing I have ever seen anywhere else.  We lucked out and only had one other couple on our tour. I believe you can have up to 10 people in a group. After the tour we were offered a shot of a black licorice liqueur, fresh fruits and water for free. Other food and drinks were available to purchase. Pics were taken throughout the tour, which we decided to purchase as this is really a life time opportunity that I want to remember. It was $99US for the pictures on disc, 2 shirts and an 8 x 10 of one of our pics. We could have substituted a bottle of the liqueur but not my taste. A little expensive but things that are worth treasuring sometimes are. This was definitely a big highlight of our trip!"

My friend and I went on a trip to Rio Secreto last week, and i think it\u00b4s an amazing place to visit for travelers that have been in Cancun or the Riviera Maya before.Normally on our first visits to the destination, we do stuff like mayan ruins, islands or eco-parks, and after that, we think we\u00b4ve done it all and we get bored at the hotel\u00b4s bars, but, Rio Secreto it\u00b4s a whole new concept of * excursion* .First of all, the ride in the middle of the jungle to get to the entrance of the river was a fun adventure, then the tour guide, * **SEBASTIAN*** welcomed us, he was excelent and did a great job giving us all the instructions very clearly. Then, when we got into the river, you can easily tell that it is a real underground river (NOT MAN MADE LIKE THE OTHERS). The adventure of exploring the cave seeing the rock formations (stalactites and stalagmites) through the years, the few marine life (since it\u00b4s a cave) and some other animals it\u00b4s an outstanding experience. There even was a point where we turned off our lights for a minute and just enjoyed the peaceful darkness and the beautiful sound of the drops of water forming the stalactites. ** SEBASTIAN ** was very knowledgeable about the river and the area and made our excursion in the river very interesting and dynamic. The trip inside the underground river takes about 1hour and 30 min. When we got out they gave us some water and snacks which we needed cause we were exhausted and ready to go home. ***SEBASTIAN*** stayed with us during the whole journey even at snack time and then he said goodbye. We were very thankfull to him and the whole crew of Rio Secreto.I work for Apple Vacations* and since we had such a great time and the tour guide was excellent i will be recomending this trip to my costumers. We loved the trip, thank you so much Rio Secreto and Sebastian."

We waited for people from Cancun, hmmm.Drove down a dusty and verrrrrry bumpy gravel road for 20 min to the actual Caves. Spent lots of time int he preparation before getting into the cave, wet suits (mine was huge) whimpy water shoes that you felt every little stone, helmet with light (cool) and best of all a hot, heavy and huge life jacket. That did me in as we only had about a 25 foot swim. Every 5 minutes we had to stop to have our photos taken, good grief. It was a slow and grueling experience. Granted the cave was cool but enough with the photos. We were not able to take in our own cameras.Got out of the cave and were given a honey/anise liquer and shown the many photos after we took off all our gear. We were then ushered tothe picnic tables where we were given a snack. Liquid cheese, sour cream (non of which were over ice) nacho chips and quesadillas to purchase. By the time we left the Rio Secreto it was 5 hours later. A 1.5 hour tour took 5 hours. The driver took us back to the Gran Bahia and l forgot my bathing suit in the van. They did not respond to my e-mails and did not somehow find the suit when we called. I would not recommend this excursion."

            "review": "Not for the weak kneed or ankled!. This is our second time to the Riviera Maya and this time we decided to go to Rio Secreto, especially after hearing our Transat rep describe it as an attraction for all activity levels, anyone could do it. We were told at that time that this attraction did not allow any cameras, underwater or otherwise. We were intrigued to hear that it had been featured in an IMAX film so thought we'd take it in. We were picked up from our hotel by the Rio Secreto minivan and after about a 15 minute ride were dropped off at the attraction's welcome centre. There is an enclosed welcome centre with two large flat screens playing Planet Earth - Ocean that you can watch while you are waiting for the group to be assembled and sign their waivers. At that time we noticed a large board in the area describing all the things that were not permitted in the caves - watches, jewellery, band aids, cameras, nothing that could be taken in the caves except your swimsuit. Had that been on our list of \"not allowed\" provided by our transat sheet we would have definitely left our watches locked in the hotel safe rather than in a tiny locker with a padlock. At that time we were told, \"Does anyone have back, neck, or knee problems\" and learned that it was discouraged for those people with those ailments. This includes my husband and I but we certainly were not going to get our money back at that point so we decided to keep on (there were a couple of quite elderly people with us so thought, if they can manage we can too). We were then loaded into another van and taken down a 7 km bone jarring pothole ridden road to the briefing place - this is where you are given your wetsuit, watershoes, helmet. Our guide again asked us if there were people with back or neck problems, and asked us if we could \"squat walk\" - move ahead a few feet forward while squatting down. We were also given the option to use a cane or walking sticks for balance, and we all decided to use them, which was actually a good thing. You are required to shower prior to putting on your wetsuit. They explain thoroughly that they need to remove all chemicals and oils from your body, as these substances may prevent the stalagmites/tites from forming as the water will slide off and they want to preserve nature as much as possible. (note: when we returned from our tour there were maintenance men working on the showers and turned the water off, but they just took the groups of people through anyways) There are only three stalls in the bathroom so if you can, wear your swimsuit there to save time changing at the beginning. Wear their wetshoes if possible, I know that most people including us have an aversion to wearing other peoples stinky wet footwear, but their shoes have thicker soles and aren't as painful to walk in over the uneven rocks in the cave. The wetsuits thankfully came in all sizes but they smell like a fish filetting house. You are provided with helmets with headlamps, tilt the light downward so you can see where you are walking, that's vital. The caves themselves are marvelous with all the rock formations, stalagmites and stalagtites. There are narrow points that you will need to duck and squeeze through, trying not to break the rock formations with your helmet or hands. The ground is uneven, slippery at points, with deep drops inside the water. There is a part in the caves that you dogpaddle through with the help of the lifevest, definitely deeper than you can stand so be prepared for that. At one point she brought us together and we sat in a group, talked about being spirits inside Mother Earth's womb before we were born and the belief that we were brought back here when we died. Then we shut the lights off and just listened in the silence. There is no light that reaches this place, complete blackness which was simply amazing. If you have claustrophobia, fear of the dark, you might not do well here. One of the elderly women in our party fell trying to do the squat walk through that narrow opening and cut her hand. She seemed to have balance problems also and I'm pretty sure that had they known what was going to be physically demanded they would not have gone.Thanks to Aida, she was a great guide who spoke very good German for the Deutch guests, and did not even mention once about giving her a tip - that's why she got one from me. I am glad we had the opportunity to do this, but I would just be careful to know your limitations before you go."

I'm so happy we weren't in THAT group, because the guide was too nice to tell him off and the parents apparently didn't care.Anyhow - OUR group was nice and quiet for the rest of the time and everyone seemed to enjoy the pace. It was a refreshing trip and the sights are amazing!The only downsides (apart from afforementioned brat) was that the food wasn't exactly the best. A snack would have been a better way of describing it, than \"lunch\", that the photos weren't only expensive but bad too (and don't get the Xtabentun here! It's WAAAAY overpriced!) plus that the wetsuits & life jackets were small in sizes. There were nothing bigger than XL and there were people in our group that had to get too small ones because of that. Hardly comfy.Our guide, Dania, was super sweet and charming - and the experience was fab.Do this!"

The iguana ran into a hole and the owner went in after it. 2 years ago the cavern was opened to the public and managed by Rio Secreto. They vow to advocate for environmental conservation of the site. This became very evident during the tour.I visited Rio Secreto December 13, 2010. I was able to book the tour through the hotel tour agents very easily, for the same price as other reviewers ($89.00 USD). I was picked up promptly at the scheduled time and it was only a 40 minute ride from the Puerto Morelos region (Excellence Riviera Cancun). Once the briefing and showers were completed, we were suited up with helmets, headlamps, wetsuits and water shoes. The attraction was out of appropriate flotation vests, so only 1 person in the group really needed one. I'm a confident swimmer and opted not to use one. Our guide had mentioned that the remaining vests may not be as helpful as needed due to the age of the vests and they would be less helpful in the water.I'm a stickler for safety on excursions. I found this to be my only concern of the whole attraction. I would have liked to see up to date flotation vests - as the ones used at Xel-Ha and have these vests used as mandatory devices for all guests I did make this comment at the end of the tour both written and personally to our guide. She did mention that the comments were very important the operation and safety of the tours.I hope the operator addresses this safety issue.For those people with issues of claustrophobia / darkness / swimming I don't recommend this activity. Your only light comes from the guide and the headlamps of those in your tour group, and It took a bit to get used to. Also persons with back / neck / knee issues may want to consider another attraction. In some spots you have to squat / walk to manoeuvre the paths.As for physical activity... 2/3 of the trip were walking on solid ground, 1/3 in the water and half of that actually swimming. Having an appropriate floatation vest would have helped enjoy the spectacular sights of the limestone formations. It would have been nice to float on my back and look straight up at all the sites. Our spectacular guide (Aida) spoke Spanish, German and English fluently. It was evident that she was passionate about the caverns and it's history. She was wonderful and the service that she offered was some of the best I've ever come across.Don't buy the Anise / Honey liquor they offer for $30 USD - you can buy it for $15 USD at duty free on your way home.Do buy the photos. Carlos made a great effort to get approximately 8 - 10 photos including 2-3 group shots. The CD was only $59 USD and included some stock photos taken at earlier dates."

Rio Secreto provides the tour guide, wet suits, water shoes, and lunch. After arriving at their \"welcome center\" we took a bumpy ride in an old safari type vehicle to a set of buildings where we met our guide (Phillipe), put on our wet suits, and rinsed off under extremely cold water (much colder than the water in the cave). Phillipe was incredibly infomative about the cave and it's preservation. During the tour, you aren't permitted to carry your own camera so there's a photographer who occassionally takes pictures of your group. Our group was made up of only 6 people and was the perfect size because we weren't rushed nor were we in the position of having to wait for lots of pictures to be taken.The only \"negatives\" to the trip are the cost of the photo packages (i think they ended up being an additional $50) and the lunch. The food was bland at best. I recommend anyone who visits the riviera maya visit rio secreto."

            "review": "Amazing Attraction. Rio Secreto is a tour through a cave on foot with some wading required. Everything here was so professional, from picking us up at our resort at 11:30am to the time we were dropped back off at 6pm. It was about a 45 min ride from Mayan Palace in Riviera Maya. At first we were brought to an area where we filled out forms, and then we got into a van that drove us to the cave about 30 minutes on the most bumpiest of roads imaginable. Once we arrived, we changed into our bathing suits in the bathroom (I would suggest wearing your suit, only 3 stalls in the bathrooms), we had to shower in an outside shower to remove all body oils, and then we were fitted with our wet suits and water shoes (if you have your own fitted water shoes you can wear those). We were all a little apprehensive about putting on a wet suit but our guide Aida was great at making us feel comfortable with the process, we also had to wear helmets with headlamps and life vests. We were in a group of about 10 of us. We had a short walk before we finally arrived at the entrance to the cave. Once we arrived we were all in awe....it was just amazing, everything was dark except for the lights on our helmets! If you go I hope you get Aida as a tour guide, she was so thorough at explaining everything to us and made it fun!! I was a little concerned once we arrived at the water in the cave, because my husband can't swim, but the life vest held him up just fine and didn't have to swim. After about an hour or so in the cave we returned to a nice buffet lunch, and went back to see all of the cool pictures Eddie had taken. This was a great experience and would highly recommend to anyone enjoys the outdoors and natural beauty!! If you are wondering about bats, snakes, etc.....we didn't see anything down there except a few small fish. I say go for it, you won't regret the experience!!"

I would Highly recommend this tour to everyone and would do it again tommorrow!AIDA our guide was awsome! It was so noce to meet you. We were provided with lockers and locks to keep our personals. AIDA was very informative and a great guide keeping everyone together and not missing out on anything from the first persom in line to the last the entire time. This is a PHYSICAL TOUR so you do need to be able to bend, crouch, walk, swim/wade, and should have no problems with darkness, water and they say claustrophobia. There is really no tight spaces so do not be too discouraged about this. Water is fresh-water, crystal clear and about 70 degrees. They offer a walking stick. I say take it since the tourain can be a bit rough at times and better safe than sorry. i even suggested to the guide that they just pass them out to everyone instead of offering. You are not allowed to take any cameras or anything into the system. You get a knee length wet suit, swimming vest, water shoes and hard hat with a small light. DEFINITELY check and make sure your light works and is not dying before you start the hike. The sights are amazing inside the cavern and the photographer that tags along takes great photos. They are offered to purchase at the end. I took the entire CD of approx 30 personal photos and an additional 50 added cave photos for a reasonable price. WORTH every penny! Rating 10 A+++ Can not wait to return on my next trip with some friends. Thank You Tom Wisk, Pennsylvania, USA"

            "review": "Rio Secreto - An Unforgettable Underground River You Must See. Close your eyes. You hear nothing but silence and the faint sound of trickling water in the background. Imagine you are 80 feet below ground with your eyes open in the pitch black. You are one with Mother Earth. You are somewhere along an 800 meter stretch of a 14 kilometer underground river that originates in the interior of the peninsula and empties into the sea. The lights come back on. Look up and see thousands of jagged-edged stalactites pointing towards your head like the tips of poison Mayan arrows. It looks like you are either on another planet or on the set of a blockbuster Hollywood movie. This is Rio Secreto.Good friends of ours, Jim and Janet, won free passes to Rio Secreto while Jim was volunteering at Mayakoba. We have been talking about us all going for months, but could never seem to coordinate our schedules. Then unfortunately due to medical problems Jim and Janet could no longer use the tickets and gifted them to us. Not wanting the passes to go to waste since they expire this winter, we arranged a trip this past Friday.We really did not know much about Rio Secreto other than it was another cave/underground adventure, and that the likes of Samantha Brown from the Travel Channel and other famous figures had visited the eco-park. Despite our lack of familiarity we were game for another wild experience.Our day began like any other Friday in recent memory: we packed the car with friends, drove to the park and proceeded over extremely bumpy roads several miles into the jungle to the entrance to the cave. At the park we were provided with complimentary wetsuits, life jackets, water shoes and helmets with lights. Then we walked a few hundred feet back into the jungle to what looked like any other cave we've seen on the peninsula.We were soon surprised at how different Rio Secreto is from other caves we've been in. Rio Secreto is like stalactites on steroids. I have never seen so many in one place. Then the cave is completely dark - there is no artificial lighting, other than the light on your head, and no other groups - just you, your guide, and your group of up to 10 or so people, wandering through an underground river 80 feet below the ground. The path was quite treacherous: up and down, in and out of water sometimes above your head, crouching down to fit below low underpasses. Luckily the terrain was not slippery. It is certainly not for the faint of heart or for anyone with health problems. This is most definitely for those with an adventurous spirit.At one point we entered a cavern that was filled with giant coral formations which were so large, I felt like a spec drifting among a reef in the sea. This was all ocean at some point millions of years ago. We trekked along this river for approximately 1.5 hours, exploring just a minute part of this gigantic subterranean aquatic highway. I can say we have never experienced such an amazing cave system so far in our time in Playa del Carmen.What's striking is that Rio Secreto was discovered only 4 years ago when this 80 year old man saw water vapor rising from the ground. He began to dig, discovered the river, and then mapped the 1st kilometer himself, before opening the river to the public 2 short years ago. To preserve the system they have 3 tours which cover different routes along the river, and alternate them over time, shutting one off and opening others to prevent wear. Lack of lighting helps prevent the growth of algae and maintain the authentic underground experience. By arranging small tours at 9am and 1pm, they stagger the river's visitors aiding in making you feel like you and your group are alone in the river, rather than running into other people multiple times.We highly recommend Rio Secreto to all our Playa del Carmen rental guests. At present we are going to rank it among the top 3 greatest activities we've experienced in Playa and the surrounding region. At only $59 USD per person or $250 pesos for locals with valid proof of residence, it's a real deal. You should call the park ahead of time and make a reservation."

            "review": "Amazing Secret River!!. This was one of the most spectacular natural wonders I have seen! The opportunity to walk, wade and swim through an ancient underground cave was truly amazing. The stalactites and stalagmites were simply beautiful. I would recommend that you definitely know how to swim or float to take part in this adventure. You will have to swim about 300 yards total in the river. The water is cold so be prepared! The life vests that are provided are not the greatest, but they will keep you afloat as long as you are at least dog paddling. You cannot take any waterproof or regular camera into the cave but you will have an opportunity to purchase a photo CD or single shots before you leave. The CD was $60.00 (US). The only negative was the 3 to 5 mile van ride to get to the location. The road was not paved and was very bumpy. Overall, it was an experience I would highly recommend to any adverture seeker."

He led us through the cave and explained the different rock formations we saw. The cave was discovered only 5 years ago and it has since been declared a national park. Eddy told us only 10% of the cave is open to the public and they can guide you on 6 different routes, the route depends on the conditions in the caves as the water level changes based on the amount of rain the area receives. It was truly spectacular experience. They provide each guest with a wet suit, life vest, water shoes and a helmet with a light. ( Just be sure your helmet light works, my husband had a hard time seeing well in the cave as the only lights in the cave are the lights you bring in) After we exited the cave we had the opportunity to purchase pictures of our family taken in the cave. The pictures were beautiful, you can purchase a CD of all the pictures for $59. Just be careful you get all the pictures you expect when you pick up your CD.After you change out of your gear you are offered a light lunch. Unfortunately the lunch was terrible. I definitely would suggest you eat before you go.Even with the extremely poor food it was still a great experience."

Everything was provided from wetsuits, vests, booties, helmets and headlamps, towels, shower facilities, lockers and lunch. The people were very helpful, courteous and gracious. My tip would be to inform your credit card company you will be in another country. There were several cards declined and you will want the pics. No cameras are allowed inside the cave and you will understand why when you go. You NEED your hands, balance and eyesight to navigate the waters safely. You will not be able to be attentive and keep your equipment and yourself safe if you are trying to get pictures. Their photographer takes great ones. This is a miraculous place and experience."

While I appreciate them wanting to preserve a natural wonder, I feel like it was more about getting money than preservation. They don't allow you to bring cameras for fear of damage to the caves, but a few photographers follow your group to take pictures, with flash! At the end, you find that to purchase like 8 pictures will cost you about $100USD. They offer a lunch with the trip, but it is shady at best. They also offer people a way to save money by not paying for transportation to the cave. DO NOT DO THIS unless you plan on hiking. We took the transportation, but saw others walking. It was like a 20 minute drive through the jungle on unpaved roads, I can't imagine walking. While beautiful, there are many others places that are just as great that don't have as many restrictions."

            "review": "An experience like no other - don't pass on the memorable opportunity. While recently vacationing in Playa del Carmen we visited Rio Secreto and participated in an experience we will never forget. Our family of five (two adults, three teens ages 17, 15 & 15) had visited a cave previously on another vacation, however this was unique and quite different. Rio Secreto is nature at its finest and possibly unlike any other place in the world. The formations inside are unbelieveable and reflect natures work over 1,000s of years. No words can accurately describe what we saw and the water inside makes the location all the more special.We had the last tour of the day, so once we arrived at the facility, we checked in and waited for another group to join us. As it turned out they were a no-show so our tour was just our family. How lucky were we?After a brief preview of what we were about to do, off we went in a van that took us on a jungle road for a fifteen to twenty minute drive to the location of the cave. Our ride there was longer than the return trip due to our driver carefully avoiding water filled ruts and potholes. More about the return trip later.Once we arrived at the cave site we were greeted by Aida, our guide for the afternoon. She was awesome! Very knowledgeable and definately enjoys her work. We were issued a locker to store our belongings, asked to shower off at an outdoor shower similar to what you would see at a beach so as to not contaminate the water or the inside of the cave. We then put on wet suits, a life vest and a helmet with a light on it. There was a short walk to the cave entrance where we went down some stairs for our first look inside. At that point the only light was from the entrance of the cave. The inside of the cave was spectacular as we hiked through shallow water, waded through knee to waist high water at some parts, and even had some swimming through the cave where the water was about chest high. There had been a lot of rain recently so the water was a little higher than usual. It was dark inside except for our headlamps and Aida's flashlight. With the water crystal clear our lights made for some spectaculer scenery. It had to be the clearest water we had ever seen or been in. Cameras are not allowed, although there is a photographer that follows along snapping photos that you can buy at the end of the tour. There are some opportunities for posed shots, although most of them are candids that he takes along the way. I would highly recommend purchase of the CD as it not only has your pictures on it, but many beautiful shots from inside the cave that have been taken since it was discovered a few years ago.The entire tour inside the cave was probably an hour or hour and a half, although it seemed much longer.After we emarged from the cave we returned the gear, showered off and dried with towels provided by the Rio Secreto staff. We had the opportunity to review and purchased the photo CD. We were then provided a light lunch and loaded up on an old open air military truck along with all the staff, as it was the end of the day, for the trip back to the home base. That ride was quite an experience as well. Being it was a larger vehicle the ruts and pot holes on the road were still there but we just went right over them. It was a bone rattling ride that just added to the great experience.We would recommend Rio Secreto to anyone looking for a once-in-a-lifetime experience you won't soon forget."

I have swam in these underground rivers before but never one like this. This one is still very much alive and well unlike many others they charge for you to see.First I want to say our guide/teacher Alfonzo was such a great person for our group. We were lucky enough to go on the tour with only four people and Alfonzo took the time to explain everything about this amazing underworld and made sure we were all safe. This is not only the most beautiful place in the Yucatan but the people who work here make a effort to preserve as such. Our trip was about 2 hours long and we really enjoyed it. I will say that if you have back or knee problems you should not go on this as you need to be very careful where you walk. Your guide will help you just move slow and careful. There will also be a professional photographer that goes with your group to get some good pictures, yes its worth the extra $55 dollars. Make no mistake this place is the real deal and if you want to do something both educational and fun this is your tour. Very few people will ever get a chance to see this underworld intact, see it now before you no longer can."

After reading previous reviews on Trip Advisor we chose not to pay the extra $$$ for the five minute drive from our hotel in Playa del Carmen to Rio Secreto but opted for the public bus instead. It was easy, dropped us out the front and was an eighth of the cost. Rio Secreto is very professional and well run. Once everyone arrives you are told the rules and what you are about to experience. You need to shower beforehand to get rid of any chemicals on your body and must remove all jewelry. They are very strict as they want to preserve this beautiful nature. No sunscreen etc. You are not allowed to take cameras inside the caves. Some people aren't happy with this but you know why once you are inside. There is a professional photographer who will take more than enough snaps for you that you can purchase at the end. I did find the disk of photo's a little expensive at US$55 but what are you going to do if you want the photo's??? Exploring the caves are wonderful. Without saying too much, you really need to explore it yourself to see its glory. Once finished you are given a light lunch, pick up your photos or disk and depart."

            "review": "DO NOT MISS RIO SECRETO!. This is such an awesome and beautiful experience, you are really doing yourself a favor when you take this trip! We booked this trip through the travel agency at our resort in Playacar because we had some tropical storm-related weather and were looking for an activity that we could do rain or shine. We were transported from our resort to the check-in area at Rio Secreto where we were given a brief overview of what to expect on the tour. We were then loaded back into the air-conditioned vans and driven into the jungle. That ride alone is worth money - it's very bumpy and exciting, but if you are prone to motion sickness you should probably ask your group if you can sit up front.Upon arriving at the actual site where the caves are, we were introduced to our guide, Pablo, who is now one of my favorite people ever. We were all instructed to shower (it's really just rinsing off and is done in your bathing suit - make sure you bring a bathing suit!) to rinse off any lotion or chemicals that could dilute in the river and cause damage to the caves. They also provided lockers (you get to keep the key with you during the excursion), water shoes, wet suits, life jackets, and helmets with lights. Visitors are not permitted to bring anything that could get lost into the caves. No jewelry, cameras, hair clips (elastic hair ties are ok), nothing that could fall off or be lost and cause damage to the cave. A second guide accompanies each group for safety and also to snap photographs that are available for purchase after the tour. Then it's party time!As we went through the jungle and into the cave, Pablo explained their geological and spiritual significance. Once down in the caves, they are simply stunning. There are parts where you walk through and parts where the water is so deep that you swim (or bob around in your life jacket). There is hardly any current and it's more like swimming through large crystal clear ponds. The caves are dark in most places but the guides have extra spotlights and the light on the helmets provides more than enough light. The caves don't have any musty smell and they're not slimy or gross. Walking through the caves is not particularly difficult though it is more physically demanding than walking normally. You cannot touch the cave walls because the caves are still alive and growing.We had a group of six young(ish) adults so we made pretty good time through the caves. At one point, we all sat down and had a rest in the water and just listened to the water droplets pinging off of the surface. This was by far the most meaningful, informative, and simply beautiful experiences that I have ever had on vacation or at home. After coming up out of the caves we got to see all of the pictures that the second guide took. They are AMAZING. They're a bit pricey but worth it. If you purchase the printed photos they are each about an 8 1/2\" by 11\" and very high quality. Then we had time to change and have a light lunch. Sandwiches, salads, and the like are included with the price of the tour. They also have some hammocks you can lounge around in.The staff at Rio Secreto were amazing. Extremely cordial and friendly. Our guides were very knowledgeable. Our tour was conducted in English by Pablo and he did an excellent job. I believe that there are several English-speaking guides. There were at least two working on the day that we went. I don't know if there are tours available in languages other than Spanish and English.I can't stress how pleased I was with this tour. Everything was of high quality. I highly, highly recommend this to anyone looking for an interesting and different experience of Mexico."

I had the conformation page with me, so they put us with other people and our group had a total of eleven people. i think it would have been better with the advertised six people. I was a little apprehensive because of the claustrophobia issue, but I spoke with one of the guides Aida before the expedition and she assured me that I would be ok, and she would check with me after the tour-which she did, and I told her it was awesome. Our tour guide was Felipe- he was very patient and informative. The light from your helmet, along with his light provides enough light, we never felt as though it was too dark for us. We brought our own water shoes, but if you don't have any they provide them. You are in the water a lot, and it is quite slippery in some place and the ground is uneven. The cave is in a pure state,just as it was found, and hopefully it will stay this way, and not become overcommercialized as some tourist destinations in the Cancun area. At the end of the cave tour there are stairs that bring you to the surface, then you take off your wetsuits, and go to a buiding to view the pictures. I forgot to mention that there is a photographer that come along with your group. after the photo viewing there is a lunch with refreshing water plain and flavored, salad and sandwiches. I did not like the van ride back to the road, (about 3 miles) I was the back seat and the airconditioning didn't work back there. Other than that the whole trip is woth it, something different to experience, while it is still a gem in the rough."

A photographer goes along with each tour group (you are not permitted to bring your own camera), and photos are available for purchase after the tour. We purchased a cd with 20 or so high quality photos for about US$55. This is a great experience, don't miss it."

You must shower on-site before entering. You must wash off any deodorant, bug spray, perfume, etc. I was told to remove my band-aids! Ladies had to remove all jewelry. You are requested to pee before entering the cave.The water was crystal clear. We drank it! The tour is a long one, about 2+ hours. They give you a little bite to eat at the end. Photos were $25 for one printed in cardboard frame, or $59 for the DVD of all of them. Sad truth: as we toured, the place was so beautiful, I knew I'd have to buy the DVD, which I did.Fernando was my guide. He spoke Spanish to 4 ladies in my group (I was the 5th wheel) and then English to me. Sometimes felt like I got the abbreviated version, but it was all good.The best part of this tour is: they really care about the natural beauty, and they are serious about protecting it. You aren't permitted to touch anything, you must tour single-file, etc. Another cenote I visited, Dos Ojos, was more like a playground, lots of tourist-damage to the beauty. Having visited both these cenotes, I enjoyed both, but greatly appreciated their differences.From Playa de Carmen find the \"collectivo\" on 2nd St (or thereabouts), heading towards Tulum. It leaves every 15 minutes and is cheap: $4. Ask to be dropped off at Rio Secreto. When done, simply stand by the highway and the same or similar bus will pick you up. NO NEED to take taxi here. Collectivos between Tulum and Playa are frequent!"

We wanted to avoid the theme parks that are common south of Playa but also wanted to experience things specific to the Riviera Maya. We made many other day trips using collectivos to visit Tulum, Akumal, etc. Rio Secreto was definetely worth spending the extra money and adding to our itinerary. The staff attempted to make the trip peaceful and fascinating by focusing on the cave, the natural surroundings, and the native/Mayan culture rather than the mass marketing employeed by other local attractions."

It is something you probably won't find anywhere else. We had a great guide named Fernando. You could tell he really loved his job and was very knowledgeable. I think he was just excited to show us everything as we were to see it! I was afraid that it would be too cold, but the wet suits really made it tolerable. I wasn't cold after I put my legs in for a few minutes. It was really beautiful to see all the amazing rock formations and gorgeous water. The tour is a full hour and a half, so it is worth the money. After the tour, they served us a light lunch at no additional charge. The pictures are a little pricey, but probably worth it. You are not allowed to bring a camera into the cave, and even if you were, it would be difficult to get good lighting since there is complete darkness in there and everyone in your group has a head light on! The photos they took are better then anything we would have taken with our own camera. We really loved this tour and we definitely look forward to it again!"

We paid $89 a person which included round trip transportation from Calica and lunch. It seems others have paid less, but we felt this experience was priceless. The ride was extremely bumpy, but the van was clean and air conditioned. All the equipment needed for this experience is provided except your swimsuit. They give you a miner's helmet, wetsuit, life vest, and swim shoes. Don't bother with sunscreen (which you don't need anyway) or bug repellant as they make you wash it off prior to entering the cave. This is done to help preserve the caves. No cameras are allowed. I'm confused by people who've complained about no cameras as I don't see how one could manage a camera while hiking and swimming anyway - especially if you're trying to be sensitive to preserving the delicate formations in the caves. You have to be very careful and need both hands free at all times as it can be perilous. Professional photographers follow you through the cave snapping pictures all along the way. Some photos are staged while others are action shots. We took our 4 children ranging in age from 10-13. They loved it! We were in a group of 10 people. Our guide was fantastic and very knowledgable. I would recommend this excursion to anyone unless they might have trouble swimming and hiking. You need to be flexible as going through the caves requires stretching, bending, squatting, balancing, and of course swimming. After the tour ended, we were given lunch which was delicious. Various sandwiches, ceviche, tortilla chips, fresh fruit and vegetables were laid out on a buffet along with 4 different drink choices. We purchased one picture for $25 after being told that all the proceeds of sales go to helping preserve the caves. You can purchase all of them for $60 which quite frankly I think is a very fair price for 15-20 professional photos. Not all groups had the exact same number of photos taken. If you have the chance to see this AMAZING site - do it!"

You get a watersuit, watershoes, a helmet and towels. A guide provides explanations about the discovery of the cave and the formations... The tour is about 1.5 hours and you go really deep into the cave until you have to swim, the stalaktites and stalagmites are astonishing.

Rio Secreto is the second largest cenote in the Yucatan peninsula, is a very large underground cave that has been recently opened to the public. When i visited this place i decided to take the bus from Cancun to Playa del Carmen and then from there a taxi to Rio Secreto. In the end I paid about 30 bucks for two people to get to Rio Secreto and back to Cancun, so I saved about 60 dls. and with that money i bought the pictures...oh yes...they don't allow you to take pictures, even with a waterproof camera...so don't bother. The price for the pictures is 59 dls and they give you a CD with a whole bunch of pictures of your tour. You can also buy one picture for 25 dls...so obviously is better to get the CD. The photographer is a professional guy so the pictures are really good and it's definitely worthed to have the pictures of yourself in this beautiful place. The guide i had for the tour (Eddie) was very fluent in both English and Spanish and was really a great guide, even though our group was very large (9). The price includes the special equipment (suit, helmet , life-jacket and shoes), the guide and the entrance to the place. This place is definitely a must see...although i have to recognize that at first I was a bit skeptical because you don't see many adds about it in Cancun...you only see adds about Xcaret, Xel Ha and Xplor...but it's probably better because there aren't a lot of tourists here...I definitely recommend the place."

Difficult to understand.. but got the gist of it. They managed to squeeze 14 people in a 12 person bus.. I rode in the back; and there was no air.. the driver drove like a nascar driver and the roads are dirt, and REALLY bumpy. We were surpristed the shocks could take it! Once there you locked up your items in the locker, washrooms were clean and tidy. We were informed on no suntan lotions, or any lotions (possibly contaminate the crystal clear cave waters) no jewellery and no cameras.Our guide was Aide? Spelling?Spoke English extremely well, and one of our group members is a bit nervous of all nature.. dark.. caves, bats.. bugs.. everything.. and she really enjoyed it!I'm a bit claustrophobic and when we went throught the 'throat\" I thought I'd have a rough time but I didn't. It just looked small.We had kids 8-14 with us. Those ages were perfect. Very safe; please listen to the guide. Preserve the area as much as possible so that other people in the future can enjoy it as much as we did.Stalagmites, stalactites and columns. Crystal clear river water, that IS drinkable AND tastes great!If I remember the excursion was 89/pp..I think... I can't remember..but I think it was worth it. They took pics.. fab pics that we could never come close to even with my lovely digital SLR camera! The CD they offered was 65 US; and I think well worth it. They served lunch afterwards, buffet style; a few sandwiches, a few salads, bread, juices, etc.We got a shot of Mayan Liquor; which tastes a lot like Zambuca.. licorice in flavour, but I think watered down.I would recommend this excursion. Good for kids and adults alike."

This is a great choice for a half day excursion that is a true wonder of nature, one that hasn't been Disney-fied into a theme park but left to speak for itself. The caves are extensive, starkly beautiful, and something you won't see elsewhere. Except right at the entrance, they are exactly as found, without adornment other than some lighting, The guide was helpful. The only catch is that they spend too much time posing you for pictures they sell you later. The cost is also a lot lower than some other sights, if you take your own taxi from your hotel (a very cheap ride from playacar hotels), since they overcharge for their bus pickup. They even serve some food and a tasty local alcoholic beverage at the end. You have to be a bit nimble to do this tour - not recommended for the elderly or claustrophic - as there are no ropes etc - and you might get the odd scratch if you touch the rocks as you swim by. But we saw young kids go through without trouble. Dont miss it."

I would recommend calling Rio Secreto and booking your date, no payment is required over the phone. We checked with the people booking trips at our hotel and they wanted $89/person. When we checked the price to book directly it was $49/person. I called Rio Secreto and received a confirmation number with no payment. When we arrived we gave the cashier the confirmation number and she took our payment. Our taxi from Playacar was $24 roundtrip.When you get there a van picks you up and drives you to the cenote. It takes about \u00bd hour. Then you walk through the jungle and go into the cave. You do not need any sun block for this excursion. In fact, they do not allow sun block unless it\u2019s biodegradable but we never saw the sun.It is amazing down there! The water is very still and the stalactites, stalagmites, and dried coral were breathtaking. My favorite part was when we went through this opening and our guide made some waves with his hand and the sound the water made against the stalactites was\u2026words cannot describe! It was the most prettiest/natural sound I have ever heard. Seriously, if they came out with a relaxing CD with just that sound I would buy it and I\u2019m not the kind of person who sits and listens to those type of CD\u2019s.I believe there are a couple routes around this cenote. Our guide said we were on the one which had more walking. I really wish we had the one which had more swimming. Reason being, it is really rocky down there and you have to watch your step everywhere you go. I found I was watching were I was going more then I got to enjoy the scenery. But this is a minor complaint.Our guide showed us a lot of things. He even took us off the path and took us into a tunnel where we all turned off our lights. Wow, now I know why some of the animals down there don\u2019t have eyes or are completely albino. We saw a catfish which all the catfishes down there are as big as index finger. When we asked our guide what they eat he took the time to point out this tiny white fish about the size of an eraser on a pencil. He also told us to touch the sand. Really cool. One lady complimented on how it would be a good exfoliant and he agreed and told everyone to try it. I have to agree. One of the best exfoliates I have ever used. At the end of the trip you can purchase pictures for $25 of $55 for a CD which you check before you buy. I saw some complaints about having to stop every two seconds to take a picture and wait for the other people to get their picture taken in the group. I didn\u2019t mind this, in fact I kind of liked it. Mainly because I enjoyed the scenery while they were taking pictures. The price for pictures/CD is really high. After you tour you take a shot with your guide. Take the shot, it\u2019s really good and not like taking a shot of tequila. It\u2019s sweet, evidently it had honey in it. You also eat lunch and the lunch was really good. If you have any questions about this excursion, please feel free to email me."

I was upset when I found out we couldn't bring cameras, but it really turned out to be a blessing. For one, you really DO need to be focusing 100% on your footing. And secondly, it's great for just once to EXPERIENCE something rather than photograph the heck out of it (like I normally do).

The photo \"scam\" is not a scam really - taking photos would have distracted from actually looking at the fantastic scenery in the cave system and other people's flash photography would have been irritating - also without a water tight casing the camera would prob have been damaged. The photo CD is $55 which includes all the photos wth you and your party PLUS about 100 other pictures taken in and around the cave system. Some superb shots which I think are worth every cent!

My husband and I had a chance to go to Rio Secreto during our honeymoon in Playa Del Carmen.The cavern system is wondrous and beautiful -- a piece of art made by nature. Since neither my husband or I scuba dive, it was fantastic way for us to experience an underground river .Our turn off with Rio Secreto was the photography scam. You are not allowed to take your camera with you. The reasons being varied. Instead they send in a \"professional\" photographer with your group and have you take photos every few minutes. Having your photo taken every few moments really distracted us from the experience of being in such an extraordinary place. Then at the end of the tour they charge you $25 US for one photo or $55 US for a CD with all the photos. i felt that the no camera policy and then charging people an exorbitant amount for a photo was a way for the tour group to make big bucks while taking advantage of tourists who want to preserve their special memory. This on top of the $49 US each price tag to take the tour. I understand that the alltournative company bought the land where the Rio Secreto sits for their own private use. i just hope that they are sincere in their conservation efforts and are not just using the eco spin to help sell their product.Oh, and one last thing the unimog (jungle truck) shown on the brochure was not used as our transportation. A van was used instead.The cave itself is a 5. But the photography bit makes me give Rio Secreto a three rating."

The tour started off with a very bumpy ride in an open air truck to the cave. If you have back problems or motion sickness the ride may be a bit of a problem. I think the ride to the cave was around 20 minutes but I could be wrong as we were all wanting to get there sooner or latter. After we got there our tour guide, Eduardo, welcomed us. He fitted us with helmets, water shoes and showed us the nice locker area and the washrooms. Following that we all had to shower to remove any oils that we may have put on in order to protect the cave. Then it was off to fit the wet suits. My 7 year old daughter had been afraid of the dark but over came her fear by going to Rio Secreto. Eduardo was great with the kids and acted like we were on a mission to find things and really made it fun and relaxing for my kids. They absolutely loved it! Even when they got to the deep water they were very confident. My daughter started off gripping my had tightly and by the end she was up with Eduardo and my son showing us where to go. After the tour there was a buffet of salad and sandwiches and drinks. Then it was time to ride back to the parking lot. This time in a nice van. For me it was a bit more nauseating than the ride there because at least with the wind blowing in the truck I didn't feel as nauseated compared to being in the back of a hot van (there was air conditioning but I couldn't get the air to point towards me) so needless to say I needed a 2 hour lie down when I got back to the condo. The visit was awesome except for the end when I felt a bit ill because of the bumpy ride. I would still recommend this experience to anyone. It was great!"

            "review": "Magical, unique experience. We took a cab from Playacar to Rio Secreto for $15 each way. Our cab driver even offered to be there for us when we finished. Easy to do and saves you a bit of money rather than booking transportation with Rio Secreto. As with many excursions, much of your experience is dependent upon the skill of the guide. Our guide, Marianna, was amazing. She effortlessly transitioned between Spanish, French and English. She was enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and obviously has deep passion for Rio Secreto and environmental preservation. Her passion is contagious. She likened our experience of going underground and later ascending to a Mayan belief about dying underground and being reborn upon ascent. She encouraged us to think of ourselves as expolorers embarking upon an adventure discovering a new and special place. Sounds a bit cornball as I write this, but it really did put you in a frame of mind ready to embrace the beauty and history of the place.I sincerely appreciated Rio Secreto's committment to preserving their treasure. All guests are asked to shower briefly to remove any lotion, deoderant, etc.. that could possibly harm the delicate ecosystem below. Once inside you are requested to avoid touching anything unless given permission. You can expect to walk, climb a bit, step over rocks, wade though water and finally swim, keeping your head above water always. It's pitch black in the cave and light is provided by a flashlight on your miners helmet. There are three spots where you pose for pictures. They're mindful to use flash photography rather than electric lighting to avoid heating up the cave and causing damage to it. At first I was annoyed that we couldn't bring cameras, but in hindsight I truly think people's cameras, videos and flash would have seriously detracted from the quality of the experience. You can purchase photos at the end, and yes they are expensive. We paid $59, if I remember correctly, for four photos on a CD. Highly recommend Rio Secreto, but there are a few cautions I'd advise people of. First, you are climbing and stepping over uneven terrain, sometimes squeezing through tight spots. If you have bad knees or hips this could be challenging. One man in our group was assisted by Marianne several times. He was a trooper, but I could tell his knee was really hurting. Second, you may get scraped on a sharp rock. Several times you enter the water that's been muddied up by those ahead of you. You can't see where you are putting your feet so it would be quite easy to get a nasty scrape. The guide tries to warn you of any obstacles, but those in the back of the group don't have the benefit of clear water to see the obstacles. If you'll freak out over a scrape, this might not be the tour for you. Also, if you're claustrophobic, you might have a hard time. There are areas where you are swimming and the head clearance is pretty tight. You're also in a dark area with bitty fish swimming around you and bats occasionally above you. If that would bother you, then Rio Secreto might not be good for you. Last, the cave is about 8 km down a very bumpy road from where you check in. If you have bad neck or back problems, this could be hard on you.None of the above are meant as criticisms or meant to deter you from what was a fabulous experience for us. I just know that not every person enjoys the same things, so it's good to know if it's not for you before you spend the money. Thanks, Rio Secreto, for a memorable Mexican experience we'll never forget!"

            "review": "Natural Wonder Ruined By Commercialism. First off, Rio Secreto isn't a river. It's a semi-flooded part of an extensive underground cave system which has been opened up to controlled and guided public access. It is incredibly beautiful and impressive - if I were basing this review on natural beauty and \"Wow\" factor, it would get 5 stars. Sadly, the whole experience of Rio Secreto was ruined by 2 things. The first was the blatant over-commercialism of the place. Cameras are not allowed inside the caverns for obvious reasons; it's dark, dangerous, and wet down there, so there are stops for photos (taken by on-site photographer) at various points along the route through the caves. Too many stops though, the main point of which are to get you to buy photos at the end of the tour. Predictably, the photos are very expensive indeed (I can't remember the exact prices, but I do remember being shocked). The other reason for disappointment was the guide who took us round. I wasn't looking for a dry fact-heavy geological commentary, but neither did I want drivel from an inarticulate and ill-informed college student who couldn't even pronounce the features she was describing.In the interests of fairness, the place itself is amazing. You get to spend about 2 hours underground walking, wading and swimming through flooded caves surrounded by the evidence of aeons of geological time. Safety standards and equipment quality are high. You get fed and watered after the tour, while being shaken down for tips.Another word of warning - The posters and brochures advertising Rio Secreto give the strong impression that the place is naturally well-lit. It's completely subterranean, with no penetrating sunlight. The light in the advertising is artificial."

We just returned to Atlanta after spending a wonderful week in Playa del Carmen, and cannot say enough good things about the time we spent underground in the amazing nature reserve of Rio Secreto. This is a spiritual setting -- not a waterpark -- and if you want to experience the beauty of this area, spend some time here. We selected this as one of our excursions based on the reviews on TripAdvisor, and had prearranged the day/time of our trip there before we left the states. A driver from the site picked us up, took us to there, and returned us to the hotel -- no problemo! I do recommend that you not wear ANY sunscreen when you come to this site. A woman in our group felt bad about the potential of her leaving some of the lotion in the river since she had loaded up before coming. There is no need since you are underground the whole time! Our guide was a very spiritual person, who shared the history and science of this underground treasure. And it is a treasure. Take some time out of your busy vacation schedule to get back to what really matters and go to Rio Secreto!"

We had the best guide in the world, Ricardo, who took her arm and guided her successfully through the entire attraction. What a treat and an amazing feeling of accomplishment for her! Even my (hard-to-please) 12 yr old loved it.The cave itself has to be seen to be truly appreciated. It is a natural wonder. I would recommend Rio Secreto without any reservations. Our guide was not only helpful, but was also very well informed and fluent in english.DO WEAR YOUR BATHING SUIT under your clothes to Rio Secreto. You will be leaving your clothes in an outdoor locker and walking a bit to receive your wetsuit and gear. A LONG walk in in your undies!"

We were shown endless amounts of excursions to go on, and while they all looked nice they all seemed like 8232348 other people would be there as well. Rio Secreto is a rather new discovery & spot for tourists to go to - we were SOO THRILLED we went on it!! I think paid $60 for the tour & transportation from our hotel, it was very much worth it. Lunch was included as well as some yummy shots of a honey flavored sambuca (which we picked a few bottles up at the Duty Free store @ the airport.. ha!).The excursion itself is out of this world.. one you can only attempt to describe by showing pictures of it to friends and family online but cannot get the real glimpse of the beauty & fascination until you go there. We forgot our wallets that day, which totally freaked me out in case we had to pay money for a locker or whatever might come up and we were pleasantly surprised that we didn't have to pay extra for anything other than tips & pictures. We felt horrible we didn't have money to tip our guide b/c he was quite fascinating and well versed in the history & science of the caves. You are not allowed to bring any cameras into the cave so we were also really bummed that we couldn't get any pictures from the camera people b/c they were truly breathtaking & someplace we'll never go to again.If you are only going to go on one tour.. make this the one. You can do zip lining anywhere (we did it while in cancun.. it was fine but you can do that in the US), or rite and ATV or jet ski... the other historic locations are great, but they will hands down be 100x more crowded than this place. The one on one attention & atmosphere makes it even more satisfying. Go Rio Secreto!! :)"

The water is crystal clear. The lunch afterwards was simple, but good with loads of fresh fruit and juices and a tasty ham and cheese sandwich on a croissant. It was definitely the high point of a wonderful vacation and I highly recommend it. I paid for the transportation, but I would have saved about $35 had I taken a taxi.

            "review": "Unique and wondrous place. I went to Rio Secreto in mid October and it was amazing. The cave was very unique. It was lucky for us because on our trip to Mexico the only time it rained was when we were in the cave. The weather does not effect this excursion at all because you are underground. It may even make it better when it rains because you can see and hear where the water actually comes in. It is a hike to get there and it is amazing that they even found this place because it is so remote. You are basically walking into a whole in the ground and it is amazing how it opens up when you get down there. The guide took us through the cave and showed us some points of interest. The water is crystal clear and you may even run into some fish when you are down there. Some things to remember before go to Rio Secreto are you are not allowed to bring cameras of any kind. We were told by the place we booked it through that you were allowed to bring water proof cameras but when we got there we found out we couldn't. Eat before you go. We left kind of early and didn't eat before it and I was hungry half way through. They do have a delicious lunch when you are done though. Watch out for little formations that are growing in the cave. Our guide told us to watch out these little things on the ground that looked like eggs and I thought she meant farther up. (Crunch, Crunch) I didn't see them and what took thousands of years to form I destroyed in seconds. The guide was not too happy about that. So you really have to watch where you are going and it does get tight in some places so watch your head! You have to take a freezing cold shower before you enter the cave to wash off any chemicals that may be on your body. Once you rinse you have to make a dash for the place where you get the wet suits. It really isn't too bad and once you start moving you will be warm. You can buy pictures there that they photographer takes but they are expensive. 25 dollars for one picture. It is worth it because you will probably never be anywhere like it again. I got one and it came out great. Overall it was an awesome trip I would highly recommend it. You will never see anything like it in your life. The people are nice, there are small groups and you will be amazed the whole time your there. The time you are in the cave is about an hour and a half and there is completely different scenery around every corner. The swimming is fun too. You do a good amount of swimming which was my favorite part."

            "review": "5 stars is an understatement.. Stepping down into the caves, was like entering into a different underworld, dazzling, serene, and creepy all at the same time. Untouched by humans, the caverns seem to swallow you whole, and it's almost like you dont know where to look first to take it all in. The stalagtites dangling precariously, the stalagmites, the crystal water.....ok I'm being dramatic, but it blew my mind. Practically, we took a bus from our resort and really didn't know what to expect. The staff greeted us and took us (7 of us) in an airconditioned van, deep into the 'jungle' until we reached the base. There they have lockers where you can store your stuff, washrooms, and after showering off you can don one of their wetsuits, a life jacket, a helmet with a light and you're off! The caves are all inter connected and marked off with rope. The tour guides took us through...walking, wading, and swimming from cave to cave, explaining the way the different rock formations formed over time. It was spectacular. A photographer takes pictures, as you are not allowed to bring your own equipment. They emphasize not touching or disturbing the rock formations...after travelling underground for 1.5 hours, you resurface and climb out. By the time you return your gear they have processed the pics, and you may choose to buy any number of packages of photo/dvd. They serve you a shot of some honey/anis liquor (deliciously like sambucca) and then you go and have a sandwich/salad....and you've earned it!! Cost was 89$ US and worth every penny. Service was excellent. Guide was knowledgeable, friendly, and spoke English. The caves, breathtaking. Not touristy AT ALL. From departure from hotel, to Rio Secreto and back again, it took 4.5 hours. All equipment is provided, including watershoes. Not a place for toddlers or babies."

Probably good for kids 7 and up, depending on your child of course. But the beauty is so amazing that it is worth it to bring your kids if you need to!!We just went to Rio Secreto on our own, and didn't go through a tour group.

I was quite skeptical after my husband brought up the idea of this adventure but after some convincing and research, I gave in and I am so glad I did this in September 09! We booked through our resort for the next morning (picked up at 7:45 a.m. ) and a short trip on an air conditioned van, we arrived at Rio Secreto. We signed the usual paperwork, loaded into another van and off down a pretty rocky dirt road to the caves. If you get carsick - this would be the time to take come anti-nausea meds! However, the drive is only about 10 min. or so and when we arrived, we were greeted by our guide (name escapes me now!! ), a small bit of history of the discovery, a shower to wash off any deodorants, oils and such on your body , then fitted with water shoes, wetsuit and helmet complete with flashlight. A short walk through the jungle trails and we arrived at the caves. I've never considered myself claustrophobic but on the walk down to the cave, I really had to breath and concentrate on the magical sites I was about to see. Our guide could tell I was having a time so he stopped, breathed with me and was so comforting! After initial apprehension, stepping into the caves and seeing the breathtaking sites, all my fears disappeared! When you realize that you are in a place that was untouched for hundreds of years, you will be in such awe that you will forget about anything else! For the most part, you are walking in ankle deep to knee deep water and swimming through a portion of it. I am not a strong swimmer but didn't need to be since you pretty much float along and take in the sites. It is quite a hike with a few parts you really had to balance on (without touching the sides to prevent damage) but our guide helped us along the hard to walk places. There was a photographer that would follow along and take photos in different areas, which we thought was a nice touch! After the tour (I believe it was 1 1/2 hours long), we changed into our regular clothes and were escorted to the picture viewing area. It was very professional done and while the pictures were amazing, they could do no justice to the place! Unfortunately, my husband forgot his credit card so we were unable to purchase any at the time (they were pretty overpriced if I recall) but they gave us a card to contact them and we could purchase any we liked at a later time. We were then taken to the lunch area which consisted of sandwiches, fruit and drinks. Nothing fancy but were weren't there for the food right? After lunch, we were taken back by van to our original point and back to our hotel by 11 in the morning. We loved the fact that it did not take all day to enjoy this experience but we are so glad we took the time. All in all, it was definately worth the money as the tour guide was exceptional! I would not recommend this for small children as the walk can be a little difficult along the formations and you have to be very careful not to touch anything! We highly recommend this for a once in a lifetime experience!"

Considering you have a professional photographer the whole time who trials your group, and consider that they have strategically placed remote flashes set-up throughout the cave, its no wonder they are priced higher than your average souvenier photos. They have actually come down on the price and we got all of our pictures on CD for $89, US. Since their were 5 of us, I consider this a bargain for the quality that you get, and you do not have to worry about lugging a camera (they are not allowed anyway). Get the pictures you will enjoy them for years. Our guide, Fernando, was very knowlegable about the history and geological events that led to the creation of the cave system. The water is about 65 degrees, but it is a cool welcome from the sometime oppresive heat of Playa del Carman. It is not scary at all, children do this tour. Most of the time you are walking in about a foot or so of water, and a few times its chest high, and only about 20 feet or so do you need to swim (more of a vertical dog paddle as your float perfectly between the wet-suit and the life jacket. It is a truely amazing site to see, we did the 2 hour tour, but they do have a 4 hour tour that takes you a different route, so we do have something to look forward to next year, as we will definitely do again. They are ways to make this a cheaper trip if you get your own transportation, it is only $49, US each to do this. We took the bus and saved at least $50 that way. The staff are friendly, knowledgable, and love what they do. THIS IS NOT ONE TO MISS, check out the photos, it is actually better than the pictures, if you can imagine that!"

And speaking of expense, we actually haggled with Best Day Travel (agency down there) for a price that started at $119/person (!) but got it down to $81 (which included park fee, lunch and transportation from the Cancun hotel zone). It would be cheaper if we'd taken their $41/person entry deal and rented a car, but we didn't want that hassle. So it was, yes, $182 for two people. That's a lot, but it's a truly unique experience. We left by 9 and returned by 3 (with the actual tour and lunch taking about 3 hours). They take smallish groups at a time... ours was 9, which seemed about right. In the price, you get a simple lunch and lockers. Everything is orchestrated and well-explained. There are changing rooms and they provide towels.The trip is stunning. I've visited a number of caves. These are huge but are extensive. You begin near the highway and they take you inland to the site (about 15 minutes). They then provide a wetsuit (with booties) and a helmet with lamp on it. You get a lot of educational information... and our guide Alfredo was a terrific guy. There were a few places were you could get slightly claustrophobic, but it's actually fun. Most of the time you're simple walking through 10\" deep water, but near the end we got to float up to our shoulders. Stalagtites everywhere, and no natural light - so the lamps were essential.OK, let's talk photos. We had previously read that the photos were expensive in the extreme (and you can't take a camera along). They've got a second guide that takes photos at many designated places (including places where they pose you, or a couple, and that was very nice). The good news is that I think they may have developed a sensitivity to this because the prices had fallen. At the end of the tour, after a drink, you are taken into a modern room with computer terminals where you get to look at the photos they too (of you or the group)... and order any combination. They'd burn these on a CD and you'd leave with the photos. Yes, the prices were high, but the best deal was to order all 8 of you (or couple) and take their general scene photos of the area... all for $80 (which was, supposedly, an \"end of summer\" price reduction of 36%). This was tolerable given that the shots were very professional, we so did it.All in all, we loved it."

However, Rio Secreto is easily the best thing we've ever done. It's a true cave exploration... hiking, wading, swimming. The sights are incredible, showing you formations of all kinds, and a wonderful narrative on how the company works to protect this wonderful site.When were there, May 2009, the site was fairly new, only having been discovered a year or two before. The staff is entirely focused on keeping it untouched for years to come. Unlike some other excursions we've seen, complete with caves carved out so the boats can fit through, this one is exactly as it was found. Please listen to your guide carefully to do your part to help keep it pristine.Everything is provided... hard hat, wetsuit, booties... and yes you'll appreciate all of them. Lot's of opportunities to clonk your head. The wetsuit makes the transition from the Mexico heat to 60 degree F water tolerable. My wife, who hates anything cold, said she did just fine until the long swim at the last, about 10 minutes non-stop. Don't worry about the swim. You wetsuit has enough flotation that it's really more like a float down a river.Lots of pictures are taken along the way (you can't bring your own camera). The shots have been professionally set up, and they are extraordinarily good. They are quite expensive to purchase tho. Don't leave without getting at least one.Mariana was our guide, and she is also a dear friend of many years. We have explored the area through her since 2004. This is her best excursion yet. She actually was part of the team that designed this trip, and her expertise and sensitivity to both the site, and her guests shows everywhere. Be sure to ask her how little Max is doing.One big plus - This tour takes four hours or less from start to finish (including driving from Playa). For us, this is much preferred over tours that take all day. You can sleep in a little while, got to the tour, and enjoy lunch, and return to your resort in time for some pool time.DON\"T miss this tour! The ride down the dirt road to the site is longer than you might think, and a very rough road. But once you get out your are in heaven."

I loved the idea of slipping on a wet suit and a helmet with a light on it and plunging into darkness. The price seemed a little high ($50 or so) but I can say it was money incredibly well-spent. This system of caves was discovered only 3 years ago (after sitting there for millions of years) and was recently opened to the public.I went with my two young daughters (7 and 10) and my husband. The group was very small (we were 6, in all). The journey begins with a primer from the guide and some things you can and can't do down there. The caves are pristine so you have to be careful that you don't grab on to the stalagmites and stalagtites. Once you are down there, it truly is breathtaking. The darnkess and stillness and the fragility of the place was thrilling.Our guide, Andres, was great. He held my eldest daughter's hand and was so sweet and patient with her. She loved it. He explained everything as he went along and was great at spotting small cave-dwelling insects and fish. We saw a tarantula, which was pretty cool.You spend part of the time swimming and part of the time walking. You are down there about 90 minutes or so. A photographer takes pictures along the way. The photos are expensive, which was the one thing that was a drag. We only bought one large photo ($25, I think). If they made them cheaper (and smaller) we would have definitely bought more. It's a shame the photographer does so much great work and then his photos don't get purchased because they are too expensive. That is my only quibble with the whole experience.After the caves, you are given a small snack and can lounge about on some hammocks while you wait for the van to take you back to the entrance.Can't say enough good things about this attraction."

It was a 100 peso 10 minute cab ride from Playa (tip - if you\u00b4re in Playa, don\u00b4t pay for their additional fee for transportation which will run you an addition $30-40 per person). When you are ready to leave, a cab can be called in for you.The tour is beautiful, unique, and most of all fun. It seems a bit off the beaten path and it is well worth the $49pp admission fee which does include a small lunch afterwards. You spend about an hour and a half in the cave system with a knowledgeable guide. Tailing the group the entire way is a photographer. They prepare certain areas for photographs which you can pay for at the end. As many other reviews have mentioned, the pictures are EXPENSIVE. A CD of the photos for the entire group was $89 (which was on sale from the normal price of $139). We opted to purchase 4 photographs on a CD for $59. The last option was for one photograph printed for $25. Yes it is quite a rip-off. However, the photos themselves turn out quite nicely. There were not more than 4 that we wantedto keep which was why we opted for the $59 CD option. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I wouldn\u00b4t recommend this tour for small children."

The caves at Rio Secreto are amazing and the tour is definitely worth it!!The only downfall is that you are not allowed to take any pictures. However, they will stop you along the way to take their own pictures to capture your experience....but they are a bit pricey (one picture is $25US). Although, looking back now, had we been allowed to take our own pictures, it would have taken away from the relaxing experience you have when you go through the caves themselves. If we are ever in the Riviera Maya area again, we will definitely go back!! The experience was amazing and our guide Mariana played a huge part in that. You can definitely tell that she is passionate about what she does and it shows! Thank you Mariana for doing such a wonderful job!!"

Personally - I think it is one of the \"must -do's\" while in the Mexican Rivera. Just a couple of minutes from downtown Playa the cave/ underground river is amazing. The tour groups are small, the guides (in our case Marianna) were knowledgable, down to earth and maybe most of all the beauty of the cave / river is not \"tourist-ized\". This is a great tour and I highly recommend it. This is a tour where you put on a wet suit and hard hat and you explore an underground cave system w/ all it's natural beauty. I realize that might not be the \"thing\" for some folks - but give it a chance - the experience is amazing."

They don't even know how extensive the underground waterway is yet. This was just discovered a couple of years ago and just open to the public for about a year. They are doing a great job to keep Rio Secreto as pristine as possible. The only people who might not enjoy this excursion are those who are claustrophobic. Some of the passageways are a tight fit, but it is SO worth it. Yes...as you've probably read...the pictures are pricey. I just bought one and I have the others locked away in my memory.

At first I was upset that our trip to Coba was cancelled, but Rio Secreto was so amazing that I quickly forgot my disappointment.A few notes/comments:1. Skip paying for their transportation. The listed price for the tour is $49/person without transportation, $89/person with. We spent $10 for the 15 minute cab ride down there, and on the way back their transportation vans dropped us off back at the hotel for just $10. By arranging our own transportation we saved $60! Another option is to take the bus to Xcaret, then walk the half mile down the freeway to the entrance. This would run you about $2/person from Playa.2. Once you arrive at the entrance you take vans into the jungle to the cave openings. If you experience any sort of motion sickness ask to sit in the front of the vans. I hadn\u2019t been carsick in years but the 20 minute bumpy/bouncy ride was more than my stomach could take.3. Our guide, Fernando, was wonderful and was by far the best guide we had at any attraction in the area.4. They provide wetsuits, hard hats, life jackets and water shoes. Fernando mentioned that I could skip the water shoes and just wear my own Keens and I regretted it \u2013 the sand at the bottom of the water is so fine and it kept getting stuck in the nooks and crannies of my shoes. Next time I\u2019d wear their shoes, for sure!5. As mentioned by many people, the photo prices are outrageous. A single photo is $25, CD with 4 is $69 and a CD with every pic they took is $169. Ouch!With all of that having been said, this was one of the best activities we did on our trip. I can be a bit claustrophobic but that wasn\u2019t an issue at all. The rock formations were amazing, and I found myself gasping in awe each time we entered a new \u201croom\u201d. At one point Fernando took us into a side area and we shut off all our lights. Sitting there, in the absolute darkness, with no noise except the dripping of water, was a remarkable experience."

It was very nice and the guide appeared to be very environmentally sensitive. There was also a nice lunch after the tour.

The only downfall to this is the ride back to where the caverns are. A VERY bumpy and long 20-30 minute ride on a dirt road. Also bring some money if you want pictures. They do not allow cameras while you are in the caverns and I don't blame them but the photos are expensive, $25.00 US dollars for ONE picture.

Rio Secreto is a truly amazing attraction, which should not be missed if you're in the playa del carmen or tulum areas. There are a lot of cenotes on the Peninsula, but this feels like a real river running underground with tons of the amazing geological formations (stalagmites and stalagtites) which can only be seen in a cave like this. Our guide, Fernando, was incredible, and was able to show us some of the really cool stuff in the cave. Most important was the first time I have ever experienced true absence of light, which in and of itself was worth the trip.The only weird thing is the photo situation. You can't bring your own camera both to keep foreign objects out of the cave, because THEY want to take the pictures, and because it might get ruined if it's not waterproof. They do take a lot of pictures for you, though, and they come out pretty cool (although don't really capture how dark it is in there because there is a lot of flash). The problem is how ridiculously expensive they are to purchase (25 for one or 60 dollars for four photos on a CD or something absurd like that). That doesn't matter though because the experience is so great."

This one is the most interesting because it is quite different, in that it is less developed and you swim part of the way through the caves. The company is relatively well organized supplying lockers, reef boots, wet suits, floatation vests, towels, showers (cold) and a small snack afterwards. The down side of the attraction, is that they want to make their money from selling you photos. The photo prices are outrageous - $169 USD for a CD or $25 USD for 1 photo!!! The number of stops to fill the CD with photo's was also annoying. However, the attraction is spectacular. If you want your own photo's of caves, we suggest you go to Atkun Chen - also very beautiful, and easy walking. BlaineWinnipeg"

You travel north from the front gate on a dusty, bumpy road - 2 to 3 miles.I overheated in the wet suit but our guide quickly had me stripped down above the waist and cooled in the water. My only fear was going too far into heat exhaustion and having to be extricated. I am just over 200 pds and it would have taken at least four strong men to get me out of there.Ah yes, the one major drawback - the photo packages are up there with highway robbery ! $34 USD for ONE 8 X 12 ! Yes, you heard right. The CD plus 4 photos is $139 USD. I kid you not. No cameras allowed !One other minor drawback, most of the staff very helpful and friendly but a few with the 'authoritative' attitude and some of the support hombres looked and acted like thugs.Still a five star in my book !"

So yes, the big disappointment about this trip is the fact that if you want photos, you will have to buy the very expensive ones offered at the end of the trip. And no, you can't bring you're own camera, not just because they are trying to make money on selling you photos, but because without background lighting, your photos won't show any of the background cave detail. They take great pains to stage each photo and each photo site contains synchronized flash attached to the walls that light up the whole cave when the trigger is depressed. Also, I wouldn't want to be on the tour where everyone is taking their own photos, you would never get out of the caves! So anyways, the tour was great. Try to negotiate a better price upfront, especially if you are with a group. We paid $45US each from a travel agent on 5th ave in Playa (alltournative), which was a few dollars less than people were paying at the gate. This paid for our cab fare there. Here's another tip, don't pay for the transportation there, you will be charged almost as much as the entrance fee. Just cab it there, should only cost around $10US each way, it's about 5-10mins outside Playa. You could even take a collectivo there if you wanted to, it's off the highway on the way to Tulum.The tour is very well run. we were in a small group of 6. The guide was very knowledgeable and also passionate about his work. He took his time explaining everything about the caves and constantly reminded us about how fragile all the formations where. We all were very careful not to stomp or grab hold of anything we weren't supposed to. It was amazing to swim/wade through the cool clear water underground, surrounded by amazing rock formations. The place is still active and felt very much 'alive'. Along with the guide, a photographer accompanies you to take the staged photos. At the end of the trip, they present you with photos specific to you. If you are a couple, they will show you photos of just you. The prices of the photos are $25 each. Cd's of 8 photos are $80US. Yes, a lot of money. Since we were travelling with another couple, we negotiated one CD of 8 photos, 4 of each couple. They were very reluctant to do this but since we weren't going to buy anything if they didn't cater to us, they eventually agreed. The end of the trip featured a decent lunch, sandwiches, fruit, juice and salad. Overall, an amazing experience and well worth it even if you don't end up getting photos. Imagine, swimming through an underground cave system, in pitch black with only your flashlights and guide to show you the way. Rock formations all around you that have taken thousands of years to form and are still forming. All a cab ride away from Playa. Pretty cool.J"

My husband, 12 & 19 year old sons and I went here last Wednesday. We booked the 1pm tour that morning from the Alltournative booth in Playa del Carmen. At 12:15 pm, we went to the booth, and the sales guy actually walked us a couple of blocks up to the main drag to hail a taxi. Price 120 pesos for the 4 of us. That's right, about 12 bucks; a lot cheaper than the 20 dollars per person extra that the girl the night before was trying to sell us. Taxi ride is about 15 minutes to Rio Secreto. If you decide to go this route, take along the phone number to call for a taxi to take you home, otherwise you'll be stranded. The jungle ride aboard the trucks to the cenote site was long and Very rough. The experience was fantastic. I've been to dry caves before, but this was really cool and my kids loved it, which is amazing given the age difference. You are given a wet-suit, life vest and water shoes. Make sure you wear a bathing suit, because you have to parade across the grounds to get your gear. My youngest can not swim and the water is over your head in some places, but he doggy paddled it and the life vest held you up just fine. I am slightly clausterphobic and when we first descended, I started to feel panicked, but I concentrated on where I was walking and on breathing deeply and after a few minutes it passed. There is a lot of walking over very, very uneven ground, often in water. The good news is that there's no sunlight, so there's no algea to make things slippery! It really was beautiful. I even mananged not to freak out when they sat us down and turned out the lights for about 2 minutes. So there's your warnings, if you are clausterphobic or disabled. They don't allow cameras inside and they follow your group around and take periodic pictures, which they sell to you afterwards. $25.00 U.S. each They had other options of buying all the photos on CD, but as I didn't do that I can't relate the price. I seriously doubt that Rio Secreto is going to ever allow anyone to take their own cameras into the caves. This is a business and they are out to make money, but I do hope they have the good sense to see that they are charging far too much for a single photo. Pictures sell future tourist's trips to Rio Secreto and if no one's taking their photo home because it cost $25.00 then than effects future sales. They need to ask themselves how many hours does the average tourist have to work to afford that photo?!! So how did I manage to post photos? I scanned my $50 worth of pictures, cropped my family out and posted them for you. Enjoy."

Now I'm a bit unusual in having an underwater digital camera but not that unusual. Rio Secreto will NOT allow you to take a camera on your tour as of this writing. They have a \"photographer\" follow the tour and take photos a specific points. Sadly the photos were not that good despite the equipment like advanced flash set ups and top quality digital cannon SLR's. They tell you no cameras because you need your hands on the caves but thats not true. It's a simple rouse to get you to spend way way way to much money to buy the photos they take of you.....$25 per photo... for the love of god 25 bucks!Because we could not take photos we chose to go to another cave tour the next day. It was cheaper and only about 10 min south of Rio it's called Hidden Worlds and it was not only caves but zip lines, sky bikes, rappelling into caves (spelunking) cave snorkeling (all optional) plus they allow cameras.We really like Rio Secreto and their environmental commitment to the cave but we hope they change their \"no camera\" policy soon."

It's wonderful inside - being from Missouri - we've been to several caves - so the stalagmites are the same. But in the Rio Secreto you get to swim thru part of the cave. There's a lot of walking on lumpy surfaces so be careful. It's amazing how the deposits from the water create columns and cathedrals. They take A LOT of pictures. They want you to buy their pictures.

            "review": "Must See!. This is a must see if you are anywhere near Cancun or Playa Del Carmen. It's less than 1 mile south of Xcaret heading towards Tulum. There is a small sign that reads Rio Secreto. The tours are booked for 9am, 11am, or 1pm. It was $49 USD per person if you book on site. This is my favorite place that I've seen in the 15 countries that I've visited. AMAZING! You take a bumpy ride on a dirt road for a couple of miles and then an reach an oasis in the middle of the jungle where you prepare to see the secret river in an underground water filled cave (cenote). You will love it! Worth every minute and every dollar."

            "review": "Amazing and Beautiful!. For something very different and interesting, visit the cenote cave of Rio Sectreto. I have only been in one cave before, Merrimack, in Missouri, and this beats that caving experience by far! The cave system has a fresh water (incredibilly clear) river that treks through it. You walk through and swim through the cave in a small (6 person for us) group with a guide who was very knowledgable about the history, culture fo the region, and science of the cave. Excellent guides!They provide a half wet suit (half your arms and legs are exposed), which was perfect, since the water is pretty cool, but not too cold. Water shoes, helmet, lifejacket, and light on helmet also provided. Very easy.I am afraid of sea life touching me (stingrays, eels, etc.), and I am happy to say that there were no such living things in the water there. First of all, it is fresh water, so no sea creatures could live there, and second of all, it is a COMPLETELY dark cave. Without your lights, there is NO light. So only bats (never saw any), and fish that rely on touch (they will avoid you, we never saw any) can \"get\" you.The rocks were amazing. Stallatites, shiny crystals, beautiful formations, were all abundant. I was a little nervous stepping on some rocks that appeared to be slippery, only to discover that they were not slippery at all - just a pretty shine to them. No algea or anything because again, you are in a cave with zero light. It can't grow.One thing that I have to warn about is that if you are truely clausterphobic, then you may want to know ahead of time that there is one area that to get through, you have to float on your back, and the guide pulls you through a very small opening. Your face is only inches from the cave ceiling, and not enough room to extend your arms. I am would think they probably have an alternate route through this area, but I was taken by surprise.Also, if you have a really hard time getting around (like my older parents), it may be tricky in some spots. One critique... The photos they take of you as you go through the cave are great. However, we did not purchase any because they were $25 US dollars apiece. Kind of expensive for a photo. If it was 10 or 15, i may have considered purchasing.I would definately do this tour again, and recommend it to others (as long as they are not elderly people who loose their balance easily). It is a great experience, and I have heard that it has only been open to the public with tours for about 5 months, so go soon, while all the natural beauty is undisturbed by man."

Rio Secreto, which is managed by Alltournative, is a must-see place. It is an underground river that has to be one of the most beautiful places that I have seen on this planet. Filled with hundreds of pure-white stalactites and stalagmites and incredibly clear fresh water this place is like being in a fantasy world. What really did it for me was the great service that the knowledgable Alltournative tour guides offered and the easy access to the river. I would recommend this experience for all travellers, young and old alike. Thank you Alltournative for a memorable day!"
