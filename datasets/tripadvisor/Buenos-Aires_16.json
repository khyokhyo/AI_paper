Part of it may have been due to the fact that there were just setting up the 2nd floor for a new exhibit. Some interesting local modern artwork on the 1st floor, but the short films they showed in the basement were mainly weird, not very \"artsy\"."

            "review": "Thought provoking displays of modern art. The Museo de Arte Latinoamericano, or MALBA, is the brainchild of Eduardo F. Constantini. Unfortunately, at the time I visited, its standing exhibit of Latin American Art was closed for updating. However, there are two other exhibits that are well worth seeing.One is a retrospective of Yoko Ono's work.I have to make a confession here--can I make a confession here?--Yoko Ono kind of makes my head hurt. Her form of interactive, creative art in the past has struck me as just too avant-garde, maybe too precious and self-congratulatory. But then again, Dar Williams in one of her shows talked about how, from her perspective, John Lennon was most famous as Yoko Ono's spouse, and not the other way around, so I decided to give Yoko another try.Much of the art was as I recall it. There are instructions for things one can do--an example is, to climb a ladder and at the top, take the magnifying glass and look at the painting hanging from the ceiling to find the word \"Si.\" Which I do. As I wandered around following (or not) the instructions, watching others do the same, and also taking in some of her other kinds of pieces such as videos, a room with broken pieces of pottery that everyone is supposed to piece together however they wish using masking tape and string, and broad maps upon which anyone can stamp the words \"peace\" wherever they wish, I found myself having a more charitable interpretation than before. Maybe it's the fact that everything is in Spanish, which adds a layer of remove (although there are also English translations in small font underneath). I've said before in other places that the question of art, especially modern art, is one I struggle with, although deferring to those whose job it is to curate exhibits seems like a reasonable approach, if an abdication of the responsibility which I suspect many modern artists would prefer remain with the viewer. An exhibit like this is a good example. People taking in these exhibits are meant to participate, and others to watch the people participating, until the boundaries between the artist, the art, and the pubic dissolves. The second exhibition is a show by Voluspa Jarpa that takes many of the declassified papers from the years of the Cold War and through a variety of media uses them and images and constructions to ask pointed questions about the role of the US in fomenting specific policies and players in the region's politics. It's a jarring, creepy picture; leafing through documents detailing how the US government had clear preferences and policies concerning different groups in these independent countries is disturbing if not surprising. Some of the exhibits that employed laser-cut plastic to copy pages, symbols and fonts are particularly striking. I regret that the permanent exhibit is temporarily closed, but it's still a beautiful space and well worth visiting."

However, the price of admission was very cheap so went to the special exhibits of Yoko Ono and visual artist Veluspa Jarpa. Both were so good and worth the trip. The Yoko Ono retrospective had many interactive exhibits that were thought provoking and fun. The Jarpa exhibit was a fascinating exploration of political documents such as declassified reports about kidnappings, murders, assassinations etc in South America."

As a student, I was able to get in free with my student ID on Wednesdays, but in order to avoid the long lines, I recommend that you \"buy\" your tickets on line (there is no charge for student Wednesday, but you need the reservation to get in) your online ticket comes to you in the form of a QR code you can show on your phone. While there, Yoko Ono had a featured exhibit, which was terrific if you enjoy conceptual art. There are great representative pieces from great Latin American artists: Frida Khalo, Diego Rivera, Xul Solar, Botero, and much more. The space is ample and the bookstore and gift shop are reasonably priced as far as museums go. A very pleasant experience overall."

I moved here not long ago, and found it a bit smaller and less-filled than I had envisioned. It's 3rd floor is in construction, but the Rivera and Botero pieces are incredible to see up close. There are sculptures and 3D pieces that offer a more interactive experience, but my personal favorite exhibit was the traveling exhibit of Claudia Andujar Marcados. Definitely worth the minor frustrations."

It's a fairly quick museum, though to be fair the third level was closed while they set up for a Yoko Ono exhibit (and closing part or all of a museum when threatened by Yoko Ono's art always seems wise! /s).The permanent collection has some nice pieces, and all signage is in both Spanish and English. There is no audio guide (in any language), which is disappointing. I enjoy hearing some of the background and interpretation of the pieces.There was a temporary exhibit on the basement level, centered around planning to place art interpretations of biology/body parts. The planning was filmed, examined, and now the pieces themselves are displayed after the films were examined (and in one case, shown as part of the exhibit). This sounded really cool, but ended up being a bit of a yawn. The positive parts outweighed anything I didn't enjoy. Given the modest size of the collection, this means I was able to zip through and focus on what I liked. This created a great morning and left time for other activities. On a side note, the store is pretty cool and had a better selection of things outside the typical bag/tote/coaster/poster/keyring/mug selection."

First off the 2nd floor is closed till the end of June so you are left with 2 floors of 'art'. The ground floor consisted of that sort of art where a 5 yr old could stick twigs on a page. It was the most boring and ridiculous exhibition and a huge visual let down. We also saw black and white photos of people, just photos. There is the main exhibit with the weird white thing you see in the photos and a few oil paintings and then you're done. I think me and my partner were in there for a total of 10 minutes and we left hilarious at how crap it was. Just a heads up."

Thoroughly enjoyed it. Discounts for students and for teachers, if you have appropriate ID, and those with a disability are free. Highly recommended"

The permanent collection, located on part of the first floor, were all that could be seen. And it cost 75 pesos - not the best deal in town. But at least MAMBA is open on a Monday when most other places (and even gardens) are closed"

There was a goodly selection of works by early 20th Century Artists -- some like Frieda Kahlo and Diego Rivera -- were well know while others of whom I had little or no knowledge. The highlight of the museum to me was a recently recovered and restored fresco mural by by Antonio Berni. Of course, like and museum dealing with \"modern art\" there was the standard collection of solid-color canvass or ones with a half dozen diagonal lines. These definitely remind me of the emperor's new clothes. Overall, it's a small collection but definitely worth a visit."

They have one (rather small) Diego Rivera painting, one Frida Kahlo painting and one Botero painting and some eclectic collection of lesser avangarde creators in ONE museum room. A small additional room contains some precolumbian art of secondary importance too. We left dissapointed. I gave them 2 points instead of their earned 1 in the hope that they will spend more time in building a good collection of art and less on advertising and politics."

MALBA is located in Palmero and I would recommend a visit as part of a walking day in the Recoleta/Palmero area incorporating the Recoleta cementery > MALBA or museo nacional de bellas artes > Floralis generalis. The cost was 100AR per person although a discount is offered to seniors (>65 years) and students with presentation of appropriate ID. There is a cafe on site but it is very expensive.Like many art museums focusing on modern art (20th century to present) this one can be a bit hit and miss in parts. On the pros I did enjoy the cinematic displays and numerous pieces on the second floor. There was a good variety within the displays but the number remained limited which was positive as it meant you didn't end up having to spend an entire day in here to cover all the exhibits due to FOMO. The museums architecture was impressive - in particular, the incorporation of natural light. In terms of cons some pieces were definitely a miss - such as the carton show fused with soft pornography on the bottom floor. In addition the piece entitled 'Mobile phone, rubber band and blackberry' appeared to be just that to me. I also must state that I didn't appreciate the inappropriate use of complicated and out of context language in the information displays. This was probably in order to try to create a perceived complexity to the work that really just wasn't there - or maybe I just 'didn't get it'.Overall one of the better modern art museum's I have been to and may be worth a visit if that's your thing. Make sure you don't miss the Floralis generalis which is located across the road."

The drawings were pretty dark- Argentina has seen some hard times."

Temporary shows are hosted at the upper level, in wide rooms that allow you to enjoy the individual artworks exposed. The permanent collection of modern art at the first floor is, on the contrary, quite deceiving. Only one Botero, one self-portrait of Frieda Kahlo, one painting of Diego Rivera. Some operas of Pettoruti, Xul Solar and Antonio Berni are blended with other minor latino-american artists of the XX century. Not really much to see and not of the highest level, in my opinion. One good point: the free entrance for the over-65 applies also to foreign tourists."

Besides its excellent and varied collection of Latinamerican art it has also a cinema where classic films are usually projected or often the vanguard films of recent poductions, difficult to see elsewhere. The art collection includes fantastic pictures of such artists as Tirso do Amaral (Brazil), Antonio Berni (Argentina), Wilfredo Lam (Cuba), Roberto Matta (Chile), Pedro Figari (Uruguay), Fernando Botero (Colombia), Frida Kahlo (Mexico), besides many other excellent painters, like Jos\u00e9 Gurvich and Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda of Uruguay, Emilio Pettoruti, Xul Solar and Jorge de la Vega of Argentina, just to mention a few. Once your visit is finished it is very recommendable to go to the museum restaurant, just to have a coffee, a small repast or a full lunch or dinner, youwill not be disappointed."

One is not overwhelmed with massive quantities just overwhelmed with massive quality.

There are one or two representative works by bigger names such as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo.

The admission fee is modest. I was glad I did go in as there is a superb Frida Kahlo painting (self portrait with monkey and parrot); it is protected by glass like the Louvre's protection of the Mona Lisa. This seems excessive. There is a lot of cubist and surrealism work by various Latin American artists (most of whom, I admit I'd never heard of) in the permanent collection.

Also, at the lower level is an egg that is equal to one in the city that will tell you something very profound related to the Internet and social interaction/contact. This museum is referred to as the MALBA and a lot of museums use acronyms here (easier when you are talking to taxi drivers)."

I went here on a rainy day and am very happy that I did. I saw a special exhibit that included work from Carlos Cruz-D\u00edaz. It was wonderfully curated and the pieces were fantastic. What I truly appreciated about this museum is that much of what I saw it did not feel as though I could easily see elsewhere. The building itself is also very well designed as an exhibition space."

The museum focuses on modern and contemporary Latin American art, covering painting, sculpture, digital art and everything in between. The permanent collection is not huge but very well curated and gives you a great glimpse into the lives and art practice of Latin American artists, from the 19th century to the present day. There is a very clever temporary exhibition on at the moment on the issue of migration, but if you miss it, I am sure there will be a good temporary exhibition to replace it. Highly recommended."

It was fairly inexpensive, well tended, and had a very diverse collection on exhibit. They seem to have a pretty deep permanent collection. The pieces are presented beautifully and there is more than enough English translation of the accompanying text on the walls by each display. The range was incredible. It might not be as well organized as MOMA, for example, but it makes sense, and leads you through a progression of periods and styles in a nice fashion. There is an adjoining cafe that is pretty good, as well. Go and take it in."

Whilst there the top of the Obelisko was on display outside which you could go into. We enjoupyed the art on display and you are allowed to take photos of it all. The art is housed in a large open arena and has toilets and lifts on all floors. Definitely worth a visit. Take your id as you are likely to get a discount if you are over 60 or a student or an educator."

The best part of the museum is outside the front door- there is a fa\u00e7ade of the Obelisk tower and you step inside and there are four live video feeds from the actual cameras in the obelisk- free and fun! The museum has the usual bizarre and ridiculous \"art\" presentations (I know, in the eye of the beholder)- one was rather disturbing; it was a video montage and one of the scenes appeared to be a woman being raped, or at least engaging in rough sex (looked like a rape scene). I would not take my child to see this. The highlight of the museum is upstairs; there is a display of glass windows and walls, objects that distort your image when looking through."

The museum is easy to get to (its in the swish district of Palermo). You'll recognise some of the painters (Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, Botero etc, but Roberto Matta, Lygia Clark and Antonio Berni may not be as familiar. The entrance fee is very moderate.My only criticism would be that the MALBA is often very crowded. Still, this is one of the gems of Buenos Aires 'Mile of Museums' and shouldn't be missed.

I went because it said it had work from Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and Botero, but though they are there and are stunning, there are much other modern and contemporary works by other Latin-American artists which are great.I personally enjoy the modern art and I thought the permanent collection was good. It is not too big but it allows you about 30 minutes of slowly enjoying it. The salon is big and well organized.The exposition at the moment was Polesello joven (young Polesello, an argentinian artist) and it was great! I didn't expect it but his works with acrylic are fantastic, fun and interactive. I went alone but I think is a great opportunity to visit with friends or family."

This isn't a large museum but it's an interesting one - we enjoyed both the permanent and temporary exhibitions. There is a seniors' rate if you're over 60. We were hoping for an overview of Latin American Art but that's not really what this Museo presents. However, being keen amateur photographers now that we have retired, we really enjoyed the exhibition on the works of Annemarie Heinrich - see our pic of her photo from 1940. We were disappointed that there wasn't much information provided about the lives of the artists but we were inspired to do more reading after our visit. Another highlight was a short dance/drama piece (approx 20 min?) representing time & at the end they formed \"a revolving door\" that you could walk through. It took us a while to work out what this piece was about (we might be a bit slow with our understandings of this art form!) but we ended up enjoying it, especially the looks on the children's faces who were also trying to work it all out!...(see 2nd photo). We combined our visit to this Museo with the Museo National de Arte Decorativo - a very reasonable entrance fee so worth the 15 min walk (across the main road) between the two museums (check opening times as Arte Decorativo opened later). Walking through this very affluent area is interesting in itself eg. lots of dog walkers exercising a range of very pampered pooches! We had planned on having a light lunch at one of the museums but both looked very expensive for what we felt like - a simple sandwich. We walked along the main street and found a pleasant/sunny outdoor cafe. If you're looking for a very pleasant day out, we suggest combining the 2 museums and staying in the area for lunch. After that we walked back to the main road where it was easy to get a taxi back to our hotel. The hotel suggested the \"safer\" taxis to look out for...not sure of name now as that was a couple of weeks ago."

I visited MALBA on a recent trip to Buenos Aires as it was one of the few museums in the city open on a Monday. I had previously visited the museum on a trip to Buenos Aires several years ago. The first floor of the museum houses its permanent collection and the second floor is dedicated to temporary exhibitions. The permanent collection is a bit limited and although several of the individual pieces are great, they do not necessarily tell a cohesive story about Latin American art when taken together. The success of a visit to MALBA really depends on what the current exhibition is. On my prior visit, the show was dedicated to the work of Felix Gonzales-Torres and provided a comprehensive overview of the artist\u2019s work. On my visit earlier this week, the exhibit focused on recreating live performance pieces by international artists. This made for a unique and at times uncomfortable visit as there was little explanation of the works, perhaps on purpose."

The first couple floors were pretty standard \u2013 works from artists across Latin America covered the walls. The top floor, however, is what stuck with us \u2013 a series of \u201cactive\u201d art installations (their current exhibition). One room had men simply painting the white walls more white. Another had us write our name and the time we entered the room on a wall. A third had a man in a corner wearing a face-covering mask that emitted light on 3 sides. The most bizarre had a man connected by wires to multiple objects floating in the room \u2013 not just controlled by his hands, but mouth, nose, ears, legs, and even some more, well, private parts. Every calculated motion of his adjusted the objects in the room. Odd, yes, but pretty unique and accessible for non-art fans such as ourselves."

Malba is a really nice museum- one of the best in Latin America, but I wouldn't say it should land on your 'must see' list, especially if you are on a short trip to B.A. If you have more time, or are particularly interested then it is certainly worth a visit. One of the best parts is that you can take pictures of the pieces- certainly something I've never experienced at another museum.The modern museum collects only contemporary works. You will see a lesser known Diego Rivera in a break from his more traditional style, and a great Frida Kahlo self portrait among other things. There is some very modern, Avant Garde art on the second floor. You probably want 1- 2 hours to get through the museum."

The permanent collection provided a good introduction to Latin American artists that I was not too familiar with. It was especially impressed with the kinetic art section. On the top floor where they have temporary exhibits, the \"Infinite Experience\" was unlike nothing I had ever seen before and I really enjoyed it. On the mail level, they had a great exhibit of Annemarie Heinrich photography. That was my favorite part of the museum.This museum is mostly contemporary art, so if you're looking for something else, you won't like it. If you like contemporary art though, definitely go.

There are 3 main floors with a permanent rotating collection on one floor and multiple modern sculptures scattered throughout. There is the standard bookshop in the basement for great books and souvenirs of your visit. When I was visiting this time they had actors performing living sculptures which they called Experienca infinite. Downstairs they had an ultra modern dance performance choreographed by Osias Yanov.

Top floor was unexpected. Performance art at its finest. One room was a guy attached by wires and pulleys to various objects in the room. His movements made them go up and down and sideways. Surprise was that one of them was attached to a prosthetic penis protruding from his pants. Next room was a troupe of marchers in an open space.

Looking at most of the schools of modern art, you see the \"Latin American\" version or translation. So, you can see the Argentinian artists version of Cubism, or Impressionism or Abstract Expressionism. What is so fascinating is the schools are clearly recognizable but the artists but have a consistent and different sensibility. Just looking at the Abstract Expressionism, the colors are more vibrant and freer. It's a wonderful collection that let's you rethink art and its expression through the Latin culture."

We have our favorites: Frieda Kahlo, Diego Rivera,Xul Solar, and Berni.In fact, all 6-7 times we have been here......there was NEVER anything on the lower level.MALBA certainly has it's fans.......we are not two of them. There are MANY small museos in BA that truly bring us joy. The reason we continue to go back to the MALBA is always this thought: This time will be different.

I haven't been to many modern art museums (as in the time frame, not the style), and I just couldn't really get a lot of it. There was one piece that was two black squares on the wall. Anddd... that was the piece. If you enjoy art, I'm sure you'll love it. If you're a casual kinda person looking to spend a good afternoon... this might not be the place for you, as it wasn't for me."

The February 2015 exhibit I saw was mostly work by Bern\u00ed, an Argentine who spent some time in Paris and gathered his thoughts about the exploitation of women and child poverty.Though his use of extremely detailed impressions of stamps on paper, including physical embossing of the canvas, he carries a strong message about the life of a woman dreaming to break the bonds of exploration. He names her Ramona. She is a prostitute who does menial jobs and prostitution to break out of her lowly status.He does something similar with the story of a child called Juanito who lives in a slum. He uses paintings and collection of refuse materials like oil cans and metal debris to speak of his poverty and dreams.Both his subjects are well developed, imaginative, carefully depicted with emotions and dreams.Be sure to start at the top floor of the exhibit to catch the proper sequence in his subject development.You will marvel at the detail of his embossed prints and the lace it produces on the garments or texture of woodwork and drapes depicted.It takes a while to see the genius developing in the work. But three dimensional sculptures made with refuse material to make up nightmarish creatures of the dreams of Juanito will pique your interest and motivate you to continue.This is not your conventional art exhibit but if you give it a chance, the talent and message of Bern\u00ed and other argentines will come to life.There are no grand masters here but there is some more genius that is being portrayed."

Before we went around the MALBA we had lunch in their very good restaurant -portions are large, which rather followed the size of the Berni paintings/ constructions. The Ramona series which details the lives of the hard done working class & girls of Argentina was mind blowing, colourful, funny & sad. But what a creative imagination for an artist I knew very little about. I assume when the exhibition finishes that paintings from the permanent collection will be put on show - as the Berni exhibition took up most of the rooms. Though I did see a fantastic Frida Kahlo -self portrait.Well worth a visit & the building / layout of the rooms is very good."

However, the permanent collection is quite small, featuring a self-portrait by Frida Kahlo and a few other works from around Latin America. While I do think the Kahlo is worth seeing, it's not worth the admission price if the temporary exhibit isn't of interest. Before you go out of your way, check to see what the temp exhibit is."

Exhibitions, reknown artists which have on many occasions visited the museum, the gift shop, the lively caf\u00e9, the Malba has it all. During the summer you can also join short courses which have been specially selected so that you may find something which will meet your interests. London has its Big Ben...

The museum is small enough that you can easily see most of the places during a single visit and the lounge/restaurant is available for a cocktail afterwards. I loved the wooden bench that seems to grow like ivy through the museum. There are spanish and english descriptions for the art as well and you will definitely see some that you'll recognized.

I have visited the MALBA museum several times before, but this visit was primarily to see a special exhibition \u201cAntonio Berni \u2013 Juanito Y Ramona\u201d of the work of famous Argentinean figurative artist, Delesio Antonio Berni [14 May 1905 \u2013 13 October 1981]. I was really glad I went!The MALBA museum was inaugurated in 2001 with about 230 Latin American art pieces that were in a private collection and up to that point spread out in different places. Through the support of the friends of the museum and the government, today the collection is over 550 pieces and is very worthwhile to see. In addition, MALBA does offer some spectacular special exhibitions on a regular basis. Currently, and till March 1, 2015, there is an extensive exhibition of the art of Antonio Berni. Antonio Berni is one of Argentina\u2019s prominent artists. He was born in Rosario, Argentina in 1905. In 1925 he received a scholarship to study art in Paris, France where several fellow Argentinean artists were working, including Xul Solar and Aguiles Badi. By 1928 he became involved with revolutionary politics. He returned to Argentina in 1931 and began his Neo-realism move, painting images depicting the struggle of Argentinean people in that decade. He responded to the political upheavals and instability of Argentina in the 40s and 50s, with a large number of political paintings including such famous ones as Masacre [Massacre] and El Obrero Muerto [The dead worker]. Beginning in the late 50s, the figures of a small boy \u201cJuanito Laguna\u201d and a small girl \u201cRamona Montiel\u201d began to appear in Berni\u2019s work, showing the struggle and difficulties facing small children as they grew up in Argentina at that time of industrialization and political instability. \u201cJuanito Laguna\u201d comes from the poor outskirts of a big city [any big city] while \u201cRamona Montiel\u201d comes from the slums of a big city. In the 60s, Berni began to tell the stories of Juanito and Ramona, as they grew up, in his art work in the form of collages, oil paintings, sculptures and installations, in which marginality and misery acquired faces and names. Berni collected samples of the garbage accumulated around the slums to be used as material describing Juanito\u2019s World. Ramona\u2019s story accompanied Juanito\u2019s and through her, Berni displayed another world of misery and exploitation [prostitution, power, sex and hypocrisy] that of Ramona.Berni\u2019s work \u201cJuanito Y Ramona\u201d was exhibited around the world in the USA, Europe, Japan and Latin America. There are about 150 pieces of work in that exhibition, covering the period from the 50s to the 70s and showing the origins, the lives and the development of the two figures. It is shown on three levels at the museum.It is truly worth visiting, along of course with the permanent exhibition. You may also be interested in the movies that the museum offers on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays [consult starting times at the museum or on its web site]. I did not yet go this year, but I was lucky enough last year to see some very interesting movies such as \u201cCornelia frente al espejo\u201d [Cornelia in front of the mirror] by the Argentine writer Silvina Ocampo. I hope you enjoy the permanent selection, the special exhibition and if you can some of the movies as well. Please note that MALBA is closed on Tuesdays [instead of Mondays like the other Museums of Buenos Aires] ."

This is a beautiful building, both outside (where its clean geometric lines and shapes capture the eyes immediately, and inside (where the exhibition space allows the artwork to be vividly exhibited and effortlessly accessed by a series of escalators and elevators. It also has a restaurant offering some of the finest lunches and snacks in the city (no meals after 4 pm, although the museum is usually open until 9 pm.), but the prices can be a bit steep.To call it a museum of Latin-American Art is as much a half-truth as the pronouncements that have flowed from Argentine politicians over the years, not least the current presidential incumbent. I counted 6 paintings by 6 recognized non-Argentinian artists (Lam, Matta, Kahlo, Rivera, Botero and Sequeiros), although there are others of which the majority of even the most assiduous art-lovers will be quite unaware . If you come here at all, it will have to be for the food, or for the paintings by contemporary Argentine artists. For me (but not for everybody), these are two adequate reasons. I was truly seduced once again (my 2nd visit in 8 years) by the freshness, dynamism, creative use of shape and colour, and most of all by the honesty and humanity of the artists represented in this collection, compared with the shallow fakery and contrivance that characterize much work out of Europe and N. America since the beginning of the 20th Cent. Here are a few of the artists, previously unknown, that especially impressed me: Sergio Camargo, Emilio Pettorutti, Joaquin Torres Garcia, Xul Solar, Jose Gurvich and Kenneth Kemble. But most of all, because a Special Exhibition of his work took up 3 of the museum\u2019s 4 floors, was Antonio Berni. His early work in the Permanent Collection was dramatic \u201csocial realism\u201d straight from the heart of someone who truly cares, and was executed in the larger-than-life style of Rivera\u2019s murals. This exhibition comprised about 100 very large paintings devoted to two specific characters he has created: Juanito (a young boy from the slums), and Ramona (a gorgeous \u2013 looking courtesan on the make). They are built up from collages, metal, earth, plaster and paint using a technique that is as breathtaking as the finished product. For me, he is the greatest artist the continent has yet produced.  Regrettably, in more recent times, here as elsewhere, \u201cart\u201d now takes the form of slashing a piece of canvass, or covering it monochromatically like a house-painter, or filling infinitely precious space with mixed rubbish to create what is called, with awe and respect, an \u201cinstallation\u201d."

The rest did show more Latin American art over the past 2 centuries, but its not an extensive collection like you may have in other large cities. Overall, worth going to."

Being him from Argentina, and by the quality of his amazing work, it is an very interesting and joyful experience to visit the exhibit. However, I must say I was expecting more from the Museum.Being the Museum of Latin American Art, I expected to see more artists from all over Latin America not just Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and its closest neighbors.It is however I great place to visit while being in Buenos Aires."

We were very lucky to run into an exhibit of Berni, an Argentinian artist ( 1905- 1981), which was shown on all three floors. It was an overview of his entire oevre, very impressive!\"At the beginning, the Argentinean Antonio Berni captured the anxiety of unemployed or oppressed laborers. A couple of years later, his vision converged on shantytowns (villas miseria), where his famous figures Juanito Laguna and Ramona Montiel represent poverty and inequity. He is one of the masters of Latin American political art and undoubtedly the most renowned and most relevant one of Argentina.\" (www.arslatina.com)"

It's better to be there earlier also because the museum is getting more and more crowded (especially on raining days). There's a permanent display of famous 20th century latin american artists including one Frida Kahlo painting. Probably this is the reason why many people go there and it's really worth seeing it. And there is always a temporary display of an artist. We saw brilliant and wide Antonio Berni's artworks."

This gallery has a smallish permanent collection that nevertheless includes some masterpieces (including a Frieda Kahlo that's probably the highlight), but currently has a superb exhibition of work by Antonio Berni, who I must admit I'd never heard of, but I loved his series of Juanito and Ramona paintings, collages and prints. The museum website http://www.malba.org.ar/ looks lovely, but had no information on when they were open/closed over Christmas and doesn't have anything findable on the Berni exhibition (on til February) except via a fleeting link on the home page.It's possibly the only museum in the world that's closed on Tuesdays"

The content is largely modern art (although there is a separate modern art museum in the city). The museum includes both paintings and sculptures set in a lovely modern building. It also houses a restaurant , which is far more than a cafeteria and deserves a separate listing. In fact, the restaurant is reason enough (if you ever needed one) to justify a visit."

With light streaming in from every direction, multiple floors and an outside area off of a higher floor - it is impressive before seeing one work of art.I thoroughly enjoyed he Berni exhibit. The way it was laid out was very thoughtful, taking you through the times of the artist's fictional characters amidst the changing geographical and political backdrops of Buenos Aires.You can go with a guide, listen or just peruse at your leisure. We did the latter and it was a great opportunity after we left to sit outside on one of the benches, watch everyone go by the usual business of the day and soak in the city.The leather in the gift shop was very close to going in my shopping bag but I wanted to hit the street fair on a Sunday. That didn't end happen and of course, I now lust after the bags not bought :(Put this on your BA to-do list. Based on their gorgeous layout, attention to flow and friendly staff, you will not be disappointed, no matter what exhibition is there."

Even our 4-year-old daughter liked it, ignored some of the exhibits and spend a lot of time studying some others, so I figured modern art really works with little kids. Some rooms were boring, then some were more exciting, we took a lot of pictures and got some ideas for little arts and crafts projects (I think that's what they call inspiration!). There is a little souvenir shop, but things are overpriced there, I've seen the same local designers' jewelry sold at a different store at a much lower price, so it's not the best place to shop, but a nice way to spend a couple hours in the afternoon."

I'd say it's about the right size as well, big enough to draw you in but not so vast that you lose the will to live trudging between exhibitions. The Antonio Berni work is fantastic and the retrospective is well enough curated to give you an understanding of his creative development. The coffee shop/ restaurant is downstairs and has an outside area which you can access independently if you need refreshments before entering."

We spent 3 hours here mostly looking at a large exhibit of works by the artist Antonio Berni... Amazing sculptures, portraits and mixed media works of Juanito and Ramona, who are two characters he depicts in the most unusual and unforgettable ways- one of a kind! The museum has some of the best works by Latin American artists you can see anywhere in the world. Don't miss it!"

The permanent collection, in display, is not extensive, but it holds some master pieces from the first half of the 20th century. It holds paintings from renown artists like Tarsila de Amaral, Frida Kahlo, Fernando Botero and others. The building has a contemporary minimalist design and it evoques similar museums like the Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid or the MoMA in New York."

The museum is dedicated to Latin American artists and has a nice selection of 20th century pieces. The day we visited was the first day for the exhibit of Antonio Berni and his unique xilocollages and xilocollage reliefs. 2 of the 3 floors were designated to this artist and his delightful ongoing story of Juanito Laguna and Ramona Montiel that covers approximately 40 years of his career. It is hard to describe the pieces, found pieces fastened to a wood backing then printed onto paper. Many of the art works had the original woodblock next to them. Visit their website to get more information, but if you love art museums, don't miss this one!"

Although we went expecting to see its collection of Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and other modern masters, we were treated to a special temporary exhibition by Antonio Berni, an Argentinian, called Juanito y Ramona. Life sized, using paints and found materials either mounted on wood or formed into fantastical sculptures, the first series tells the down trodden story of Juanito, an imaginary boy living in a shanty town. His next series turns to Ramona, an imaginary seamstress turned prostitute, whose dreams have been turned to nightmares by the monsters of life's realities. I would think that enjoyment of the museum's collection would depend on whether you like the temporary exhibit as the permanent collection is rather small. We absolutely loved our day there, ending with coffee at the delightful cafe."

The museum has a very good and varied mix of art, with modern, contemporary, and more traditional art presented in different small exhibits. MALBA is definitely good for those with shorter attention spans, as the exhibits give a very clear sense of their theme with a condensed number of works. We were also there during the \"light exhibit\" (by an artist named LeMarc) which was a genuinely cool installation using things like mirrors and CDs to throw light in interesting ways.A tip for travelling students: if you get and bring an ISIC card (highly recommended, at least within Latin America given the number of things you get for half-off or free), you get in for free."

The entrance area was an instant wow factor with a superb yellow mobile hanging. Each room was filled with interesting art works. The light displays were fantastic! I stood for ages transfixed by the moving works. Along the corridors are wooden benches with carved slats that then twist and twirl around the walls and over the edges. Wood craft at its best! Do not miss this place if you like modern art. This is way better than the Arte du Moderno."

I agree that since at least 75% of the artwork is by Argentine artists, the \"Latin American\" art title of the museum is a little misleading. However, the museum is relatively new. It opened in 2001 so hopefully it is working on expanding its Latin American collection because I think that would add to the experience. That aside, there was plenty to enjoy about the museum. First, I loved the Le Parc exhibit of light sculptures. It was something I had never seen before. Second, the permanent collection is not too big but interesting. Also, the building's design is pretty impressive with the cool benches, atrium and modern art sculptures. Most if not all the descriptions have English translations and the admission price of 50 pesos is pretty reasonable. Even though the building is big, there is not that an overwhelming amount to see. We were there around 90 minutes and saw everything. Overall, it was an interesting experience and if you enjoy this museum, I would also recommend checking out the Coleccion de Arte Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat in Puerto Madero"

I came about three days too early for the main exhibit on the top floor so I only had access to the permanent collection and the collection on the ground floor. Nevertheless, I thought the permanent collection was quite excellent and entertaining, albeit a bit small (you can finish it within an hour. ) There were interactive, electric-powered art installations that really intrigued me and the area truly did give me a better sense of Latin American art. I didn't care too much for what was going on on the ground floor. I believe it was more local, contemporary based artists. I can't complain too much though; at only $50 pesos as of July 2014 it's not a steep price to pay for a small but excellent collection."

A great museum for kids as the art is modern and visually interesting for young eyes (almost \"cartoony\") and it isn't terribly large, so the little ones won't get bored! Free coat check, bargain price for entrance and overall, a great way to send 1-1 1/2 hrs on a rainy day. Definitely recommend to get a taste of porteno/LA culture!"

There is one painting by Diego Rivera and one by Frida Kahlo, but the rest of the collection was not worth it in our opinions. We cruised through it pretty quickly. The building itself is an incredible space and very beautiful. But half of it was closed for either renovation or a new installment. Either way, we didn't think we got our $50 pesos each out of it. The best thing is that there are good explanations in English that help you along."

Splaying grass openness with trees, that have fairs integrated into it, with botanical parks, a planetarium (where a huge pillow fight is annually held), concerts, etc. Be careful after hours because the more poor locals tend to seek out tourists, especially in places you won't have safety- like here, so don't take your date out here and stick around for when it gets dark because the whole onda (vibe) changes to a darker more dangerous one. If you are living in BA, you will find that a nice thing to do is make a simple life that you can share with others. For example, go get your mate, a book, a guitar, friends, some food, and spend time in the park- that's where the fun is, I cannot even recall how many friends I've met doing that. It's really a place to meet people. Very social. Go in the summer when they have all the great and free events, while the roses of the rose garden are blooming, and the fairs are bustling."

The setting is pretty amazing, ultra modern, light and airy and a picture of calm in a bustling city. We were fortunate enough to go when the Mario Testino exhibition was on which was a real highlight for us.... So many familiar images which you have seen in magazines but not realised it was by Mario... Pictures of Kate, Nadia, Naomi, Gisele, madonna.... Loved the pictures of Kate moss in particular and also the one of P Diddy and Naomi having fun.Other highlights included the permanent exhibitions of the South/ Latin American artists like Frieda Kahlo and other notables...The space was also great for kids because it allowed them to roam around pretty freely!"

Mario Tostino has photographed Madonna, Lady Diana, Mick Jagger, Jennifer Lopez and many more celebrities throughout his 30 plus year career as a fashion photographer. The current restrospective exhibit of his work is one of a kind. At first I felt that I was looking at a Vogue magazine, the usual classy photos, but since this is a retrospective that includes color and black photography, it did not take me long to transcend the familiar and begin to understand the enourmous talent of Mario Testino. The size of the prints is huge, the imagination that permeates the sets and colors is impressive. The imagery invites a desire to access the additional shots that must have on the rolls where the ones selected for this show must have come from.I highly recommend this exhibit."

The timed entry was so that you could get a good look at the pictures, close up and from a distance. They've added some new things to the permanent collection and it was good to see old favourites. With entry for 50 pesos, it is good value for money."

This had wonderfully creative art ( not really weird art), some beautifully classic pieces with a twist of creative inspiration that was intriguing. The old masters are great, but much of the art here was classic And creative. The other great thing about the museum was that we could see all of the works witin 2 hours. That is probably longer than most people take to go through the museum. We took our time an dtook pictures of a lot of pieces and just admired them for a while. So, you can get your thirst for art in - and a deeper understanding of the culture and history of Argentina and Latin America, while not feeling like you may have missed something in another half of the museum, or taking up a whole day. The museum also has one of the best shops books that I have ever seen in a museum. It was a beautiful place to buy books - not just of the museums works, but of many different genres. It looks like a beutiful library with many book cases, with a gliding ladder, etc. It has a lvoely feel to the shop. ( The book shop is down on a lower level from the regular gift shop. Enter the regular gift shop, then head downstairs.) Take all the pictures you would like while there - just leave the flash off. The staff was not at all hovering or uptight hovering or uptight as at some museums in the U.S. Must be the sweet nature, and more relaxed attitude of the people in Buenos Aires in general. The staff in the various rooms was gracious and didn't mind taking a picture of my husband and I in front of a couple of pieces. Great place to visit. We highly recommend it."

Luckily the cafe was open and we passed the time over a cup of coffee and later ate lunch there which was particularly good. The permanent exhibition was disappointing, with only a few really outstanding paintings. Well known artists such as Frieda Kahlo and Diego Rivera only had one work each, and amongst the other works there were only a few that showed any real depth. My overall impression was of an art school exhibition. But worth going to if you are interested in the modern expression of a countries culture."

That said, I truly enjoyed this particular collection-exhibition more than most. In some sense, MALBA takes \"less is more\" to heart, by thoughtfully putting together an evocative display of Latin-American art - in all forms of visual media - that displays a richness of cultural expression without exhausting the visitor. The entire collection occupies two compact floors of exhibit halls with an open skylit three story space that itself is a work of art and architecture, with a few surprises."

It is a good thing there is air conditioning. We were at the door when it first opened at noon. The initial ticket purchase process was slow, people deciding what type of ticket to purchase. The price was very reasonable. Seniors were free but we decided it was easier to pay for an adult ticket then to \"demonstrate\" that we were seniors. The building is very beautiful and airy. There are three levels of exhibits and you can take an escalator or a glass elevator up to each floor. Brochures about the exhibits are in English and Spanish. You are able to take photographs of the art. Just don't touch anything! Each exhibit has a staff member in the area to answer and questions. I enjoyed looking at art that I had seen only in magazines. MALBA also has a very nice gift shop.There is an excellent cafe / restaurant that is open lunch and dinner. You don't have to purchase a ticket to get into the restaurant. The food (and wine) was delicious - superb chef! Hours of operation: Thursday to Monday and Holidays 12 noon to 8pm. Wednesday 12 noon to 9pm. Closed on Tuesday."

The permanent collection is very interesting as well. The price is right (40 pesos) and seniors are half price (and not just Argentinian seniors). There is a cafe that serves very nice food and a patio for dining outdoors if the weather is good. Beware that the MALBA opens kind of late (noon, I think), so check the hours. Nearby are the Japanese garden and the Rose garden, if you find yourself in the area too early.Cameras are allowed inside, but you will have to check your backpacks."

The artwork is limited, and I really only appreciated the art on the 2nd floor.However, the curation, the explanations of each room, and the set up is well done. They display what they have well and try to pull the viewer into the experience. It is not a passive experience in this museum - it challenges you in the question of \"what is art?\". I loved that part of the museum.We did, also, learn about Argentine artists that are a significant part of BA's identity. After visiting this museum, we saw their art and names in many other places. In that way, the viewing of this museum enhanced our experience in the rest of the city.I would most DEFINITELY recommend a visit to this place, but be aware it is a small collection, not one of the world's best classic European art museums."

However, after a short stroll, I started wondering what's the point of the artists and visitors walking around the premises. I felt like I was in a venue for mentally challenged people. I generally appreciate art in all it's forms, but this was a bit too far stretched for my taste."

Anyway, the amount of art displayed is just enough and while I didn't care for some of it I appreciated the variety of different medians exhibited.

I love the fact that MALBA has many activities to offer--meaning the public participates a lot and can learn from the arts. The cinema offers really amazing films, and there are usually discussions about the films/directors, and you can participate if you want, and there are guided tours for those who want to learn, or are just curious. The prices are relatively good, it's free on wednesdays, and I think you get a discount if you're a student, or are ovver the age of 65, or under 12.MALBA also has a very nice restaurant, where you can go have coffee, or dinner, or both. What I most like about MALBA is that you can dressed really nicely, or normal, and it is OKAY. There are many temporary exhibitions, like Yayoi Kusama, and they tend to be AMAZING. This last one was so successful, you had to wait in line for HOURS to buy your tickets. It was totally worth going."

Once inside the exhibit is incredibly immersive and acts like a time machine, taking you back to the free-loving 60s and 70s - she organized a lot of orgys and happenings. The infinity mirror, black light, and polka dot rooms are all really fun and bring you into the experience. It's really fun and helps make your time in BAires feel a little more cultured."

The exhibition quality is comparable to that at MoMA in New York, although it is a much smaller museum. One surprise was that there are quite long lines to enter, which seemed to be a result of having far too few persons selling tickets. We waited in line around an hour to get in. The restaurant is currently not open. The design of the building is very modern (again, MoMA like). The top floor seems to be designed to have a non-permanent large exhibition. When we visited, there was a retrospective of a Japanese artist (Yayoi Kusama). Again, some lines to enter into some aspects of this exhibition -- there was a room where you could experience her sculpture and only three people at a time could get in. The second floor housed the permanent collection, which is focused on Latin American modern artists. It begins with artists who were creating around the time of Picasso/Matisse, through present day. As I'm not all that familiar with these artists, I don't know whether they left anyone out, but it was very nicely presented. Also on this floor was a non-permanent exhibition (smaller). On the first floor is a relatively small museum store (with some tasteful jewelry, scarves, home objects, as well as books), and another small exhibition space (more Kusuma when we were there). If you enjoyed this museum, you may want to check out the less known Museo Sorvini (located in Parque de Tres de Febrero) -- it was also very nice, but from the guidebooks, we didn't expect to like that one as much as we did."

It begins right from the street with the trees on both sides of the museum entrance dressed in red and white Kusama polka dots. The motif is repeated through the museum, including on the lift and escalators. Make sure to see all her exhibits, especially the ones with her press releases and memos - what politics the woman had, even in the 70s! There was a huge queue to get into a room with infinity red and white penises (at least that is what they looked like to me, when we finally got in after one hour), but as there were two of us, we took it in turns to stand in line and go look at the other exhibits on the way. The Labyrinth (dark space, lit up with coloured lights and mirrors) was enchanting as was another dark room with coloured spots floating all around. I don't know why the queue had gathered for the other room, these two were the best in my opinion, so I am glad there was no queue there, anyway! It was all fantastic, though there were some pieces that left me bewildered and others, disturbed, but on the whole, I fully recommend this exhibition. Only, make sure you get there on a full stomach - the cafe was closed, and I do not know for how long. But then, if you walk for about 10 - 15 minutes towards Recoleta, you can get some lovely food to eat! More about that maybe in another review : )"

This should definitely be a stop on your museum tour. I'd put it at number one. It was definitely better than Bellas Artes. If you are a student they may let you in free as well!! They did for me!This is also in a really great location- down a couple blocks from all the embassies. It's a great idea to do Bellas Artes and MALBA together (because the walk is only 15-20 at the most) and then head down the main drag for a bit toward the embassies to see them. Then turn left into what I think is Centro (maybe Recoleta first and then Centro?) Anyways, it's really nice!!"

We saw one Frida Kahlo, one Diego Rivera, one Fernando Botero, a few Xul Solars - so, quality, just not a lot of quantity. Some interesting sculptures and some artists with whose work I was unfamiliar.Couple of caveats - you will likely need to take a cab to get there - it's not too close to the subte. Oh, and right now (summer 2013) the cafe is closed too.

Allow yourself 2 hours, more if you plan on having lunch at the excellent indoor/outdoor cafe. Don't miss the gift store and book store as well. You can take pictures as well just make sure you don't use the flash. This is one place where you can go back to again and again and always see something new. It is one of the first stops whenever I have guests here visiting."

The building design is terrific, and size-wise, MALBA makes for a perfect morning or afternoon - enough for a few hours but not overwhelmingly large. The permanent exhibits are great and the special exhibits we saw were really exceptional. I was not highly familiar with Latin American art so this was the perfect way to \"see\" the culture from the perspective of the arts world. They have a very nice but pricey cafe on site that we considered but passed on. It's clearly geared to tourists and the menu looked good but it was fussier than we were in the mood for. But they have nice indoor and outdoor seating so worth a consideration.A great visit!"

The waiters were unattentive to put it nicely, just RUDE to be more realistic. No one would look at us for quite some time, and when we finally stopped to ask someone if they would like us to seat ourselves they hardly even responded, and referred us to \"a guy up front\" who was not present. When we sat on a sofa where others were served we were litterally ignored and stepped over clumsily three times until our table mates (who we did not know) called the waiter back and asked him to serve us. He responded something along the lines of \"not yet\" because he had other people to serve. We just left. Don't bother."

The Modeles also by Berni in 1977 was another social statement of our times. la gran tentacion, 1962, was a third we enjoyed. Beyond Argentinian art, the other paintings we recommend are Parejo( couple) by Alejandro Xul Solar, 1923 and the Brazilian Tarsila do Amaral's Abaporu, a visual stunner."

The website showed a nice mix of modern and classical art, so I was looking forward to this museum. The first exhibit was Bye Bye American Pie, which was very interesting. It claims to show the US from the 1970's to present, however it was mostly a collection of pictures of people taking drugs and lots of pieces of 'art' that were just a blown up map of Iraq with words 'painted' on it. It was a very depressing, and hardly encompassed anything of value. The 'live' animatronic was bizarre as the heads looked more like Abe Lincoln than GW, but the point was very clear.The rest of the museum was a collection of modern 'art' photographs, which is basically photoshopped pictures. Overall I was disappointed in the lack of real art, and was surprised that this museum was very small. I would skip this museum, unless you can't get enough of modern 'art.'"

We began by purchasing the guide at the store and getting the audio guide which is very helpful.The second and third floor contains most of the Argentinian Artist but also some Andy Warhall's. The exhibits are fantastic. Unfortunately we found out some of the well known Latin American artists were on loan to other museums in the US. So if you want to see some great Boteros, you will have to go to Houston, Diego Rivera go to New York and Kahlo go to Los Angeles.We finished by having lunch at the restaurant which was superb. I had a mineral water and the salad which was fantastic. The service was attentive. They first bring delicious breads and 4 different types of dips."

Awesome Latin art and great installations of the benches that become hanging art.When we were there the 'bye bye American pie' exhibition was pretty shocking. Mainly Larry Clark's photos of going home to Oklahoma and shooting drugs and living 'regular American life.' It still churns my stomach. I really liked it because photographs have never done that to that extent before. Not a really great feeling leaving the place though.The cafe was great too. ordered a coffee and then a wine - and both came with free little bites to eat. Little brownie squares and a little cheesy bread thing with horseradish sauce. Just glad I ate before the exhibition. Not for the faint of heart."

First, there was an expectation that we were going to see some of the great iconic contemporary Latin American artists like Diego and Frida. However, the collection, or a vast part of it, is on tour in the United States. Instead they have two temporary exhibitions, one of which was called \"Bye, Bye American Pie\" which was of second rate American contemporary artists whose premises is to display the decline of the American dream. Great! Just what we need to ge touring the world! We were not impressed. The building itself is spectacular. The front line staff were less than welcoming and spent more time talking to each other in personal conversations, than paying attention to visitors and assiting them. There is also no map guide for the museum so you have to blindly find your way through the museum. For the money, I think you would be better off at the Collection of Amalie Fortabat in Puerto Madero -which has a combination of traditional and contemporary art from mostly Argentine artists."

Playful and thoughtful.Only complaint: there are absolutely no signs regarding photography anywhere in the pamphlet or the museum. However, if you try to take a photo, you get yelled at. And, apparently, you are allowed to take phots of some pieces or art. There is no information about which pieces you can photograph and which you cannot, and this led to a frustrating stroll through the museum. The art, though, carries the day."

The permanent collection and building is worth the admission. 25 pesos, Thursdays through Sunday and 12 pesos on Wednesday with discounts for seniors, children and students.The museum's collection can be viewed within an hour but more time is well spent on admiring the layout of the entire building, its contents and even the dining experience. The museum cafe is high priced but the food is very good and the atmosphere is quite nice.I would definitely recommend a visit to this museum with children and would visit again."

It was smaller than I thought it would be and there aren't that many exhibits. There is a nice cafe where you can find lots of business people having lunch and coffee. I suggest you go on Wednesdays, because they offer a discount on your ticket. It costs $22 AR every day except on Wednesdays, when it's $10 AR. Also, all the signs are in Spanish so you may want to rent an audio guide if you want English explanations. All in all, it was a nice way to spend a couple of hours out of the heat. It's right across the street from the Paseo Alcorta Mall in Palermo so you can browse through the mall after your visit."

I would prefer to visit one of the better shopping malls than spend time at MALBA. The spaces are nice, but there's nothing special to see there. Now, if you do want to see a great museum in Argentina, travel down to Trelew in Patagonia and see the Paleonthology Museum.

And a great exhibition going on now by Carlos Cruz-Diez, who is amazingly talented. It's a beautiful piece of architecture in its own right, and just the right size for a museum that's interesting, but doesn't have to consume a whole day or more to see. Highly recommended."

The collection, while most of it is more modern, is fantastic (and if you love modern art like me, this place is even better!). One of the coolest installations in this museum is the two benches... One on the top floor and one on the middle floor, that are \"connected\". You would only know what I mean if you see it. Even though photos weren't allowed, I managed to sneak a couple of this bench, which I will post later. Great museum though, and a must-see in BA!"

It was a nice break from the shopping and offered some interesting insight into Latin American culture and some of the local artists who have influenced art throughout the region. Though I am not generally a \"museum-fanatic\", the MALBA is a modern facility with lots of open space for the various collections and exhibits, and was a well-spent 2 hour visit. It reminded me of a mini-version of the MET with a touch of Guggenheim. We topped the visit off with a delicious afternoon snack at the museum\u00b4s cafe (yes, there was wi-fi.) One of the assistants at the MALBA told us that in the evenings they have a theater that features a variety of movies- including local Argentine, South American and even classic US movies from the 50s for about $8 US!"

My friend and I love to visit museums when we travel, both for the art and to check out the cafes which are often a great value and interesting ambiance for a lunch dining experience. The MALBA cafe did not disappoint us on either of those fronts; the art was great, very fun and interesting, The wooden benches with vines of wood extending over the railing and down two floors is spectacular! My favorite piece was a painting by Brazilian artist Tarsila Do Araral, yet there were many other pieces that really moved me...The MALBA cafe is not to be missed; I recommend that you plan a museum visit around lunch or even just tea--the drinks come with beautifully arranged plates of pastries or appetizer-type snacks (see photos, taken w/mobile phone). Design is one of my favorite forms of art, and this cafe is a splendid example of outstanding interior design, as well as cuisine design (if that's even a term! :) Make sure you check the hours before you go, the cafe opens before the museum--which opens late--as I recall. Enjoy."

The art on the second floor was my favorite because it included some more recognizable artists. I am not an art expert by any means. The last floor is full of modern art, which is definitely not my style. However, the displays were done well and it was interesting to discuss the concept of art with my husband. There is a small cafe and store on the bottom floor. The store was overpriced and the cafe wifi did not work with our phones."

Try to go on a Wednesday when the ammision is 5 rather than 15 pesos.On a furture note, if you enjoy the work of Xul Soalr at the MALBA then I think you would also enjoy a visit to Museo Xul Solar which is a small collection of his work in a multi level home in once occupied."

However, I prefer going to museums where I can either read or listen to information about the art in addition to seeing it. They had nothing of the sort at MALBA (in any language), which seemed strange to me given its status as a top museum in the city. I was hoping for either a detailed guide book or an audio tour. I appreciate art, but understand the significance behind the works much more when I have an explanation. For that reason, I was disappointed in our outing there and won't recommend it to our English-speaking visitors when they arrive. The building is beautiful and there are well-known artists who have paintings on display; however, I didn't walk away with a greater understanding of Latin American art from my visit."

Remembering it started as a private collection (gathered by Eduardo Constantini), just like Calouste Gulbekian in Lisbon, helps you understand the importance of this museum, if you start getting disappointed by its small permanent collection.Its size is not only a result of its VERY SPECIFIC approach (20th century latin american art) but of Constantini's accurate perception. He chose (and could afford) some of the finest examples of contemporary art in the continent.Besides the Latin American artists known in the whole world, like colombian Fernando Botero and mexicans Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, it shows important pieces from the best 20th century painters in each country, like Tarsila do Amaral (her masterpiece Abaporu), Candido Portinari and Emiliano Di Cavalcanti, from Brazil, and Alejandro Xul Solar and Antonio Berni, from Argentina, to name a few."

I paid 5 pesos per person instead of the usual 15 pesos ( It was a Wednesday). I figured what could go wrong with 5 pesos.I was happily surprised with the airy atrium. There were a lot of people visiting that afternoon but I did not feel cramped in the museum. I saw paintings by Xul Solar, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera just to name a few. There was also a photography exhibition by Manual Alvaraz Bravo. The intertwined wooden bench by Pablo Reinoso was very interesting as the structure went into different floors. There were guided tours available but I arrived a little late for those. Instead I took a break at the museum cafe and had my beef pita bread sandwich and a cappucino. I finished off my visit with a quick browse in the museum shop and was surprised to find a quiet bookstore downstairs. The museum is very manageable and can be easily seen in 2-3 hours. 5 pesos or 15 pesos, it was still worth a visit. I felt I got a good introduction to Latin American Art."

I personally found that the building architecture was one of the best parts of the museum.Bad: Small museum. Not a lot of exhibits. And of all of the exhibits I found few good ones (but then again I am an average joe and not an art critic.).My opinion:If you are a TRUE fan of modern art, then this is a must see. If you are a fan of art, or just a tourist, then there are far better art museums (like Museo de Belles Artes) to see in Buenos Aires. Only visit this museum when you have exhausted all other options.Please take time to rate my review. Thanks!"
