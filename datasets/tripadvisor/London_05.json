It was really informative and a very clear easy to listen to recording. You can also ask any of the stewards questions which is quite advisable as the have little gems of information to pass on.It cost \u00a318.50 and we spent about 1.5 - 2 hours there. There was no problem with queues when we went at 10.40 in the morning."

We didnt have a guided tour but opted for the audio tour, which I have to say was very good and wasnt disappointed. The guided tour gets the personal touch of course. The audit was very informative and had additional information you can select as you wish as you pass around the building. Building was splendid and full of so much history, many paintings, and many other points of interest, and of course for us House of Lords and Commons were great to enter and take in the atmosphere. Thankfully number of places to rest for a while too, photo opportunities were limited (wasnt allowed in many places at all - which is understandable too). We went around 3ish and was not manic, and cost was \u00a318.50 for an adult (\u00a316 concessions) - was in our opinion a great visit and value, and we learnt a great deal."

The guide was knowledgable and had lots of anecdotes to share with us.The tour takes in both the Lords and Commons chambers and lots more in between. Once inside, you have access to the restaurant and bar so you can spend more time inside if you wish. Security checks on entry are similar to those at an airport so it is advisable to plan some time for this. All in all, a really worthwhile couple of hours."

For goodness sake, though, get advice on the queue to get in. I waited more than an hour on the ramp into the building, and the queue only seemed to get longer after I joined. Other reviewers may have advice on how to avoid this. First tour in the morning perhaps?"

Our guide, Sue, seemed to be quite knowledgeable, and, from the snippets I heard from other groups, that appears to be the norm. We walked through the Queen's robing room, along the route she follows to the House of Lords, visited the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Parliament wasn't in session, so we got to walk into the actual parliamentary chambers, rather than up in the visitors' gallery. That's impressive because I'm American and I've never been on the floor in Congress. The tour took well over 90 minutes, but was full of interesting stories, and never got boring. That said, I don't think this tour would have been interesting for anyone under high school age. Although they will appreciate stories like why members of Parliament from opposite parties must stand at least 2.5 sword lengths apart, they have less perspective on why the monarch is not allowed on the floor of the House of Commons. But, this tour was our favorite activity of this trip."

Probably not for young kids, but ages teenage and up will enjoy it. Be prepared to stand and walk for nearly two hours. There is an option to add tea afterwards... DO NOT skip this. When you purchase tickets on-line (and you should), add the option at that time. At the end of the tour, you are escorted to a restaurant that overlooks the Themes, and served tea and appetizers. Do NOT bring your camera... if you try to use it, it will be confiscated and your tour will be over (and I saw this happen - they're not kidding)."

Quite a few points of interest along the way and you certainly leave feeling like you've learned something.

Part of our tourist week in London, we booked a full guided tour of the Houses of Parliament, with a human being taking us round, not an audio guide!Quite simply, best thing we did in London all week.Not only did we cover the history of the building and of the United Kingdom, but also how the whole politcal system works in our country, in very simple terms!We got to see the House of Lords and the House of Commons.We must have spent the best part of 3 hours there.Go and see it soon, before they move out for the major refurb, which is desperately needed it seems behind the scenes, but you wouldnt know it walking round.Just a brilliant afternoon and especially when you tie it in with a Thames river cruise as well, which you get from right outside.Highly recommended."

They also have English guided tours but they are slightly more expense and times didn't match up with our schedule.The House of Lords and House of Commons inside were very interesting and it was very educational learning more about the history of Britain's parliament and government. History and politics are of interest to me so it was worth the price of admission. If these topics aren't of interest, you may find the price of admission on the high side."

The tour is approx 1.5hrs long and the inside of the building is amazing. Only downside was that there was only one opportunity to rest your legs and we rushed past a number of paintings in the corridors that may have been worthy of a look.. Maybe if we had done this tour with the headphones we could have sat down a bit more often and taken in the pictures. Having said that Sean made the tour very interesting, thank you"

Need to book in advance and option of eticketing is better as collection point is different from tour starting point. I changed mine from collection to eticket.Guides are informative. Hearing the time tell traditions, stories of monarchy versus the parliament, standing in houses of common and lords, admiring the ornate halls, voting for ayes and nays - all are an experience to be enjoyed. Pictures are allowed only inside the main hall. Tours takes a total of two hours and happen when parliament is not in session. Tours for residents can even be arranged through their MP's for free it seems and they can even view the debates.Overall an informative enjoyable visit for us outsiders."

The use of stories and anecdotes could really set the magnificent history of the place alight. Also, there were too many guided groups in close proximity - often we could not physically manoeuvre around them, or concentrate on what our guide was saying as the one next to us was also speaking loudly to their group.

No-one enjoyed the white wine (it was truly terrible) but the red was ok. The food was acceptable but we were all hungry again by 11 !!!I think they cash in on the beautiful surroundings and history of the venue and provide a very mediocre standard in all other areas...bar the tours...which were fantastic.

The actual building themselves are magnificent although a couple of areas were cordened off due to ongoing repairs. I thought i knew a fair bit about politics but i learnt a lot. The commentary is mostly up to date with current job holders although no mention of teresa may! A really worthwhile although pricey trip. You can get a free tour if you contact your own mp as its part of their jobs to show people around."

At the next room, I got restricted to proceed even though I explained that I had waited half an hour in St. Stephan Hall. Got back to St. Stephan Hall, the staff who had told me to go to central lobby didn't say a word to explain the situation, even he pretended to not seeing me before and ignored me. The other staff from central lobby told me that I had to wait another half an hour starting from the very queue that I had just waited in. They, who work in Westminster Palace where Parliament that is the most representative of UK is situated, just insulted me. I got humiliated in that place, they just ruined the image of UK and it was very dishonorable behavior. They should be more responsible to the visitors overseas."

The outside of the building is well known to all no matter from what country you live in and from the number of tourists busy taking photographs you can see why the Houses of Parliament is a popular tourist attraction. A tour of the HOP is well worth doing as it reveals so much more than the outside. First book your tour. So easy to do with a very easy website and very efficient. Saves queuing. Usual security checks (airport style ) to go through but the security service are polite, helpful and of course very efficient. Once you get through the checks you enter through Westminster Hall. Here you pick up your audio guide and the rest of the tour is then done at your own pace. The audio guide is excellent. Very informative as you move your way through with extra information if you desire it. The corridors, hallways, rooms and eventually debating chambers pack a sense of history, style and an overwhelming feeling of 'wow'. The grandeur of the House of Lords, the magnificient gilded screen behind the throne is is contrast to the plainness of the House of Commons. Standing at the despatch boxes gazing at the opposing benches brings out the \"politician or the comedian!\" in you. ( I've had an email from Sandra in Conway who wants to know why her local buses are not running on time?) At this point I should be shouting Order, Order. The debates are televised and we are familiar with the chambers but the one thing that we don't see is how small they are. The Houses of Parliament tour is money well spent and very cheap compared to the London Eye. Well worth doing and a highlight of my visit to the Capitol."

We saw the very interesting huge entrance hall, Westminster, is an architectural masterpiece in that wooden arches hammered onto the sides of the roof provide the roof support without the need for supporting posts allowing an unobstructed view inside.The history of the building, the architectural motifs, and the history associated with the monarchy around Queen Victoria, Charles 1, Henry VIIIth, various PMs, and the political system were all presented in an engaging manner."

It sits on the north bank of the Thames, adjacent to Parliament Square. The nearest tube is Westminster. There are plenty of pubs, restaurants and shops nearby for refreshments. Toilets are available within Westminster tube station (at a cost) or for free in the local pubs. Do at least buy a drink though.There is a lot to see with this building, so do walk the perimeter. The clock tower is known as Big Ben, although strictly speaking, Big Ben is the main bell inside. Try to get there on the hour, so as to hear it chime - it has a beautiful tone. At the opposite end of the building, the Queen's Tower soars into the sky with a Union Flag fluttering above in the wind. Adjacent to the Tower is a pleasant garden that is well worth a look.If you venture across the river over Westminster Bridge and take a right down to river level, see if you can spot the gnome carved into the embankment. Clearly the masons were having a laugh. Highly recommended."

Apart from that, it is certainly worth a visit. It gives you a lot of history and a good understanding of how the English government system works. It is expensive, but by far not as busy as the Westminster Abbey. The ticket office is at a different place, about 10 minutes walk from the entrance,.To be sure you can go in , you can book your tickets online for a certain time slot and print them or if you don't have a printer, you can pick them up at the ticket office. Take enough extra time to pick them up! There usually is a line up and you still have to walk from the ticket office to the entrance (10 minutes)."

This World Heritage site has been in continues use since the 11th century, as a royal palace and now as the center of British Government. The palace was burnt down in 1834, so the Gothic architecture you see today is comparatively recent. The palace houses both of the UK's ruling bodies, the Houses of Parliament and the House of Lords. When parliament is sitting after dark, a light shines from the top of Big Ben's tower. It is possible to arrange tours, visit debates in the chamber, even climb the Big Ben's tower. Visitors can only tour during the summer with tickets purchased in advance. The tower was built to house the King's wardrobe and jewels in 1365 and today house the 'Parliament Past and Present' exhibition about the history of Parliament, (admission charge).

It takes you through all the different parts of the Houses of Parliament like the Commons Chamber and the voting lobbies. The audio tour allows you to get extra detail about the different parts if desired, and I walked around in awe of being in a place that is such an important part of British history and where people like Churchill and Thatcher spent so much of their time. If you are into politics, like myself, you will be interested in seeing parts like the Commons Chamber that you might have seen on television, and even if you are not into politics, you will enjoy finding out more about the huge building and how it has changed over the years. It was an experience that I will never forget."

Got to see the House of Lords and the House of Commons and the grand halls throughout. Lovely staff and very knowledgable. What we loved was there was no restrictions on where you could go and the fact that you are in areas where you constantly see on tv is very surreal. Had to drag my partner out as he loved it that much but everyone should go as it's such an old building and everyone should go and visit. Very small gift shop but lots of good suffragette memorabilia and a wonderful art work called tides of time dedicated to them that it above one of the halls that lights up at different tide levels."

I did this and the secretary that took us round was obviously trained to do the tour also as they were very informative.The tour takes about 2 hours in total from security to exit.Note there is only certain area you can use your camera. Some good opportunities in the the first main hall at the top of the steps, at the next long corridor, and also just outside the entrance to the main hall where if you angle it correctly you can also get Big Ben in the picture.Note kid focused tours are only on certain days if you are going for the normal paid tours.

One can buy a ticket from a counter on the ground floor of a building just opposite Westminster Pier. Give yourself a good 1.5 to 2 hours to do justice to your ticket. Guided tours are available only when the parliament is not functioning. However, we were told by one of the guides that one can visit the parliament for free and also watch the parliamentary proceedings while the parliament is in session. Just check with the security and depending upon the space and the matter being discussed they will let you in.You need not be a British citizen to make use of this facility."

The management of visitors in London seems to have improved massively, maybe the London Olympics was the catalyst. You are treated warmly from the police at street side, right through the tight security, up to the moment you walk into the impressive Royal Palace where again the staff are excellent. We went on a guided tour. I haven't been on an audio tour so can't comment on the difference. As expected, the tour guide quality is excellent. Our guide was warm and greeted each of us into the tour. I wont go into the historical detail, but it was enormously interesting and a rapid trip through British royalty and governance since around Edward the Confessors reign. One last comment, the wheelchair bound guest in our group was also handled very well. Recommend you go!"

Well organised, extremely knowledgeable and friendly.Tours are going on all at once with audio tour users doing their own thing but everything was very well organised with a good flow through the various fantastic rooms that have seen so much history. There are only limited places that you can sit to rest - certainly not in the House of Lords or the House of Commons were you stand in among the benches. The tour can last nearly 2 hours so if you are not good on your feet best to avoid it.The tourist shop is well stocked and the caf\u00e9 is good quality but predictably expensive.Highly recommended that you do this at least once."

It last approximately 105 minutes and was interesting from start to finish. Obviously the highlights were being in the House of Lords and the House of Commons but the architecture, paintings and wall murals, gold leafing and the feel of history were equally important.Our guide -Derek- was eloquent and clear and made sure that everyone in the group could hear him and see the exhibit. He had time for questions and even though I'm sure he does many of these tours, never once sounded or made us feel that he was just relaying a script. You were only allowed to take photos in 2 main areas and not in the 2 Houses. Once the tour was finished we went for the prebooked afternoon tea in the orangery overlooking the River Thames. The setting was picturesque, the tables were nicely placed so you didn't feel like you were sitting on top of people and the staff were attentive and didn't rush you. The food arrived on a beatiful stand and was a delight to eat. The scones were warm, fresh and when combined with the jam and clotted cream, were the best I've ever tasted. We also had a glass of the House of Commons Savignon Blanc. There was time for selfies on the outside terrace before reluctantly leaving. I prebooked the tour and the tea online and it cost about \u00a360 per person and we all felt that this was terrified value for money."

Although long, it provides plenty of information which helps you piece together the pieces of British political history you've managed to imbue. Having said that, thus does strongly depend on your tour group or guide - our guide was good but catered to the group of school children in our midst and consequently was simplifying a lot of the information that we wanted to know more about."

It's a true Victorian gothic masterpiece. It's also fascinating to see for yourself where Black Rod knocks on the door and where our leaders face each other in debates and PMQT. The explanations of the division bell with the ayes and no corridors were clear and interesting.I recommend this tour for anyone interested in politics/Victoriana.The admission ticket also covers entry to the Jewel Tower over the road, again worth a visit if you are interested in history."

            "review": "A must-see for local and tourists alike - audio tour recommendation. I\u2019ve been on a guided tour of the Houses of Parliament before, but I must say that the audio tour is much better because you can go at your own pace and the quality of the commentary is outstanding. You will need to go through security when you arrive, which is similar to the procedure you find at an airport. Once inside you can pick up your headset in the ancient Westminster Hall, which is over 900 years old and the scene of many of the most important events in British history, such as the trials of King Charles I, William Wallace and Guy Fawkes. You\u2019ll need a couple of hours for the tour, which runs in a loop taking in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. You\u2019ll end up back in Westminster Hall where you can choose to visit the extensive shop or the caf\u00e9. One of the best things about the tour is that the staff are so friendly and cheerful, even though security is tight and it\u2019s really busy. If you are looking for a good place to have coffee or lunch I would strongly recommend you visit Wesley\u2019s Caf\u00e9 which is in the basement of Methodist Central Hall, just a few minutes walk from Parliament (opposite Westminster Abbey)."

You walk around to the side facing the Thames River and walk to the far end of building. The actual visitor entrance to Parliament is near the middle of the building basically across from Westminster Abbey. Security is airport style with metal detector. As far as tour goes in one word FANTASTIC. The tour guide took us through the Queens changing room where she gets ready to open parliament then into the House of Lords across the long hall way to the rowdy House of Commons. That was the major highlight as I watch Prime Minister questions every Wednesday. The history was amazing. Highly recommended for those who follow politics and/or history. There is a self guided tour but pay the extra for the guided one."

Really cool and fascinating stuff!I got the audio guide and spent such a long time at each number point because there was so much information. If it's too much, I'd recommend just listening what you want and then moving onto the next room. There's primarily no photography in a majority of the rooms visited but that's not a problem. For me, the audio guide was enough but the guided tour did seem pretty cool and engaging as well. If you're willing to spend a little more, get the guided tour.

It is a very ornate building inside and out and is an iconic centrepiece of the London landscape. The souvenir shop sells quirky political-themed gifts.

This is something everyone should do at least once when in London. You can buy your tickets online or in person at Portcullis House just opposite Big Ben. The ticket office is just around the corner facing the river. Lines move quickly and the staff is very helpful. It costs \u00a325.50 (senior discount available) and is worth it and more. After going through security you will meet your guide for the tour and he or she will take you through this icon landmark with an excellent running commentary on the history of the building as well as a primer on how the British government works. Thrilling to stand in those debating room we've all seen on TV and in films for so many years. After the tour there's a good cafe for sandwiches and sound and of course cake. I had Victoria sponge and it was delicious. This stop is a must for Anglophiles."

It's important that this home of democracy, regardless of its grandeur, can be viewed from the inside, and so it is much less intimidating to visit these days. There are the necessary security barriers but the police do a great job of keeping the institution and those within it safe while not being overbearing. It's definitely worthwhile adding a visit to your itinerary, especially if you have children and would like to embed in them a sense of history and civic engagement and how Parliament works."

This is our second visit, six years apart. Both were guided in style and the security was unobtrusive. There was somewhere to wait at the start and the tour started promptly.We would urge anyone going to book the afternoon tea on the Terrace.

Though probably best to call and check availability first. You can only go round when they are not in session, so check that also if unsure. Tickets are bought at Portcullis House which is across the road from Big Ben, the door is facing the river at the far end of the building. I think we were unlucky with our civil servant as he was particularly incompetent and grumpy, but we got our tickets. You then brave the crowds and traffic to walk right down the front of the Houses of Parliament to the entrance. There is tight security as you would expect, but not daunting. Much like at an airport. Once inside there is a cafe a shop & loos. (Suggest using loos as it's quite a long trip round) We then had quite a queue for our headphones, but once there they are efficient and easy to use. The commentary is a bit long winded for some but you can dip in and out of it. There is a post office inside the building so a great place to post any postcards etc. if Id have known I would have taken something in as you cannot buy anything to post (except first day covers) It is most odd wandering into the House of Lords then the House of Commons - places you think you know so well! Loads of history and lots of unexpected details also. There are few places to sit & rest and lots of stairs etc so I'm not sure it is for the less mobile. I expect that if you enquire there is an accessible route - we certainly have less physically able peers and they must get in. "

I recommend that you pay a little extra to take the guided tour rather than the self guided one with the earphones. The reason is that you not only get an in-depth talk but you also get the opportunity to ask questions. You also get to go into the different chambers where the people with the self guided tour cannot go. That was what made this tour fascinating! This is a must do tour."

No idea this existed but our guide Tracey deserves a medal- she prepared us with emails of a virtual tour and bags of information so my daughter was fully primed for our visit. Tracey met us off the train at Westminster and we spent almost 2 hours with her. She was exceptionally knowledgeable about the place, its history and developments to the present day. She also is clearly passionate about her job and about engaging people with our democracy. We realised how much of a priority the powers that be have put on how open the place is kept to the public in these days of so much global instability. Quite uniquely so. After our trip, the whole Parliament/politicians concept seems so much less remote to us and I would strongly recommend anyone to visit. And thank you so much, Tracey, for bringing it all alive to us. We had a wonderful time."

I wouldnt really bother taking a camera as they wont allow you to take many pictures better to buy the guide book which we did was \u00a35.00. the houses of lords and commons you cant get a wheelchair down through the centre you go in the top of both then a guide takes you around through back corridors through to the other side of the house of commons and lords then you can get right up to the centre of both houses. so you do not miss anything if anything you get a behind the scenes tour ask the guides to look at the medals cabinet and they will tell you about them. if you want to ask questions staff are in every room and go out of there way to answer questions. I asked him about suffragettes and Mrs Pankhurst, he said she locked herself in a broom cupboard during the census, and Michael Jackson wanted to buy the queens lovely throne from the house of lords and was told sorry its not for sale etc. this info was priceless thanks for that. if parliament staff read this thanks for such helpful facts and info and thanks for looking after my disabled husband they went above and beyond even the coppers were very bright and friendly and welcoming and happy in their work. arrive 30mins early to get through airport style security. our children asked questions and they worded them in a way any child could understand. if I were you book tickets online we didn't (but you cant get a carer in free only as kids and cares free just had to pay for husband) and were told only ones available are for tomorrow so we bought them and went to tower bridge and London eye instead. best photos to take are of the outside of the building statues of famous people in the park next door which we used as it has a playground for kids at the far end for them to just have some playtime after being so well behaved inside parliament. do book the audio tour as you can go round at your own pace and keeps kids entertained too. please be carefull in houses of commons a foreign toursist stepped past the ropes and get severe telling of by police with a gun so do read the signs.WARNINGone thing I'm not happy about, they had an art installation it looked like dead skin off a giant animal hanging in the entrance hall. they did have signs warning it was latex I saw it, but husband in a wheelchair didn't see it. it made his throat very itchy as he is sensitive to latex. so watch out I think it was disgusting reminded me of dead animals and should be in the tate modern not in houses of parliament. so many people are allergic to latex I think bigger signage and when you hand your tickets in the guy on the security guide could have warned us."

Anyone even remotely interested in history or politics should visit the so-called \"strangers gallery\" in both the House of Lords and the House of Commons. It's a bit of a process to get in, what with security and lines, but the officials are cheerful and efficient. When I visited it was a 35 minute wait to get into the Commons but no wait to get into the Lords. Apparently it is a mob scene once a week during Prime Ministers Question Time, when the opposition tries to tear the PM a new one, politely, of course.You will have to give up your mobile phone to get into the Lords and silence it to get into the Commons. No backpacks either. Behave yourself - they have a zero tolerance policy for taking pictures or video. I watched a security officer in the Lords strangers gallery question a woman who checked something on her phone. The woman was required to show her photo stream. No fooling about. Also, the gallery steps are *steep*, so if you have balance or stair climbing problems, see about the accessible entrance.The interiors of both chambers are magnificent, the Lords more so with the throne and such.It was interesting to hear the debate in both houses. I was there just pose Brexit and the Lords were discussing the UK's relationship to NATO post-Brexit. The Commons was discussing the Wales Bill, devolving power to the Welsh National Assembly, like Scotland. It's like watching the news happen in real time. The formalities are kind of a hoot as well.I move that my Honorable Friend from Tripadvisor visit Westminster. (Hear! Hear!)I should note that the expression \"Hear!

I strongly recommend you to visit it in fall, or spring, or maybe even in winter; this place is too overcrowded in summerIt is really worth a visit. You won't regret it.

I visited here the first time in 1978 with a friend or a friend who was an Member of Parliament and was able to see the House of Commons, deserted, and sit on the benches for a while. It was a treat to be long remembered. But if that doesn't quite work out for you, the next best thing is to reserve a spot on the Saturday tour through the Parliament offices on the web. Obviously, with so many foreign visitors, you must do this early - we made our reservations around February or March when we could easily pick the precise hourly time. Plan on arriving early to deal with the airport like security system. Enter from the western public entrance - many bobbies are around to help direct you correctly and join the ticketed line. You will be directed to wait in the large hall until your group is ready to leave (toilet room available). The guides are thoroughly professional and will regale you with the many details and personal stories that you would normally expect. The full experience will go for about 90 minutes with very limited seating opportunities (not possible in the H of C) and no bathroom breaks while touring. For government enthusiasts this is one of the two required visiting sites in England (and the other is the Magna Carta at Salisbury Cathedral)."

The guides are all skilled funny people and born story tellers. They give interesting details, show you around parliament rooms, and they answer questions.

I thought about his earlier words that \"Africa was rotten to the core\" and wondered what type of conversations were taking place inside Buckingham Palace. I slowly detached myself from the party and returned to look at the Great Hall. It was dark and empty and yet full of stories. I heard a telephone ringing. I will never forget it's constant ring that seemed to go on for an eternity. I followed the sound into the lower parts of parliament. It kept ringing, demanding my attention. I tried to determine if the ring tone was delivering good news or bad news. You do that sometimes. Then all of a sudden the telephone stopped.

Tours are conducted early in the day, before parliamentary business starts, so you have to be there by 9.30am.We were taken to see both the House of Commons and the Lords, as well as Westminster Hall. The building is beautiful, and a warren of corridors and passageways! The Commons is much smaller than it looks on TV. Unfortunately you are not allowed to take photos in either of the Houses - there are some very zealous security guards who will tell you off if you try!We rounded off our tour with a visit to the gift shop - reasonably priced souvenirs, and by having a drink in the cafe - a bit expensive, but decent coffee and nice cake.I really recommend a visit to the HoP. Even the stroppy teens enjoyed it! To be able to see so much history and engage with our seat of democracy was a real privilege and something that none of us will forget."

We were greated in Westminster Hall the oldest part of the building and an amazing building, we were then shown around the central lobby and through both chambers of the house being told a lot about the history and role of the building and the people who work there. The staff and security were very friendly and filled in a lot of info on the building, you could tell they really enjoyed working there and most have been there for a long time. We also managed to get into PMQ. I had wanted to visit for many years and this was certainly something to tick off my 'bucket' list. If you get the chance arrange a visit through your MP to get a sense of history and the power of the building."

Turned up 20 minutes early and there were hundreds in the queue. Sent to to the end of the queue with people who had all booked, with many missing their time slot. Eventually got placed on a guided tour where some of the party were on a coach trip which had to leave soon. We rushed around the tour with hardly any time to take a good look at the building and art works. Done in an hour. The audio tour people could take their time and look around at everything in detail at their leisure. We were herded like cattle and stood in one place in each room without being able to look around it. I queued less time on the London Eye. It is magnificent building and we saw one or two rooms audio visitors do not see. Interesting tour guide but I spent longer in the queue than on the tour. Do the audio tour if you want a good look around the building and get there at least an hour before your time slot."

The tour was fascinating; we were able to enter both Chambers as well as see much of the connecting halls and large meeting rooms. The symbolism built into each room was a striking reminder of the Empire that the UK once was, and after the Brexit vote, this was made even more poignant by our guide. The tour itself is about 2 hours, which is a bit long for families with younger children, as all that history can sum up to loads of dry, boring detail if you're not really interested. However, just seeing the place makes some of the drier bits easier to take! :-) If you can manage it, register for tea ahead of time and enjoy fabulous High Tea along the Thames in the MP's tea room!

My husband is a history teacher and I am a political enthusiast. Our teenage boys are actively engaged in all political discussions around the house. Can you imagine my surprise when I casually asked one of the guards outside the Parliament if we could visit without any prior appointment or reservation, and he responded saying sure, why not! Ma'm, which house would you like to visit, the House of Commons or the House of Lords or both?Wow, it is was so, so, so interesting to be able to sit there watching live debates between the politicians, right in the heart of all the bustle of Brexit and just a couple of days before the PM resigned!! It was a memorable trip that left a lasting impression on all four of us! I also want to add that the staff at the Houses of Parliament was most courteous and welcoming. The only restriction was that one could not take photographs while the parliament was in session. I highly recommend this visit to all who are interested in politics and those wanting to get a glimpse of where the mighty British Parliament makes important decisions for their country, and maybe the world!!!"

The tour goes through by area numbers and ran smoothly, and was very interesting. The only down side was the no photos policy I would recommend this tour if you get the chance."

I had visited the Parliament in Ottawa Canada and wanted to see the one in the UK. Apparently according to the audio I had they said there were not enough seats in the commons for all the MPs. I was interested to see that the PM sat on a bench in the middle of the room but there were no tables in front of anyone as there is in Canada. When the two houses get together as when the Queen opens Parliament they have to use the great hall to seat everyone. I found the visit very interesting. Outside in Parliament square I saw statues of Churchill and Mandela among others. That day there was a peaceful demonstration against Brexit so lots of people watching. Take the audio tour."

This on top of the fact they have 5+ tours going around at the same time in the same route so in echoy halls its hard to hear anything in the mix of different tour guides.

Following a fire in 1834, the Palace of Westminster was rebuilt to the design of architect Charles Barry. Included in the new design is the most famous clock tower in the world - Big Ben. Westminster Hall, which survived the fire, was built in 1097 and is considered to be one of Europe's finest medieval buildings. It is the largest Gothic building in the world and was the main Royal residence until Henry VIII moved to Whitehall. And it\u2019s full of houses: namely the House of Commons and the House of Lords.

A must visit for historians! We gained unprecedented access to some areas, and were afforded plenty of time to explore at leisure, looking deeper into some of the extraordinary events that have taken place throughout history.It was a real pleasure to know that for a moment, I was standing on the same ground once trodden by legendary parliamentary figures such as Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and Lembit Opik (that one who married a cheeky girl).As we left, I purchased novelty items from the reasonably priced gift shop and had a light snack and beverage from the reasonably priced cafe. On the whole, a terrific, educational and inspiring experience that left me wanting to pick a team and bally well cheer for them!Thank you Guy Fawkes for being the terrorist equivalent of Emile Heskey.

This was pure aesthetic nostalgia and has served absolutely no practical purpose since. The Building is averse to progress of all kinds as technicians must go to excrutiating lengths to install simple modern conveniences such as wi-fi and air conditioning. The taxpayer has and continues to fund myriad \"adjustments\" attempting to mitigate the crippling problems inherent in the design and pull Parliament's books back into surplus. However as a piece of our collective national history and pride it is an irrevocable landmark. A symbol of unity and pride which is needed now more than ever. Also it can be an awful lot of fun watching MP's (our so-called \"representatives\") get into partisan shouting matches. The gift shop has some cute pieces of memorabilia and contrived souvenirs aswell."

The directions provided thru audio took you to specific areas all numbered & in order instead of just wandering around & bumping into people. Only in certain areas could photos be taken. This was one of my favorite stops whilst in London. Tube station directly across the street. Just steps from Westminster Abbey & other Landmarks. Glad we went inside for the tour.

When you look at it from the South Bank \u2013 you get a true sense of how grand this building looks. Big Ben stands majestically overlooking the Houses.The nearest underground station is Westminster.It is a great place to spend the day with your family and to learn the things that take place here that govern the country. There are many interesting facts about the Houses of Parliament. There are guided tours that will give a wealth of information of this Parliament. Parliament is made up of the House of Commons, the House of Lords and the Monarchy. Members of Parliament debate and have discussions in the House of Commons and the Lords either approve or not in the House of Lords. Parliament makes and passes new laws, debates various issues concerning the country and approves Government spending in terms of the taxes and budgets. Parliament also monitors and checks the work of the Government by questioning ministers and their respective ministries.When you think of history, you will recall that Guy Fawkes tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament. He must have been crazy to carry out such a deed. Security is very tight just like how it is in airports. There are restrictions on what you can and cannot photograph. By the way, there are no cloakroom facilities.Tickets cost GBP18.50 per adult (June 2016). One child up to 16 years of age is admitted with each fee paying adult. You will need to select which timed tour you wish to go for. There is a caf\u00e9 that serves snacks and drinks and a nice gift shop.I would highly recommend a tour of the Houses of Parliament. You will definitely like it."

I had no plans to visit Parliament on my most recent trip to London, somewhat misguided in believing it would just entail looking round a few rooms that I commonly see on TV. However, following the EU referendum debates I have had a renewed interest in politics so decided to spent some time in Parliament rather than just taking picture of the building. There were extensive queues to get in, around 20 minutes, understandably security needs to be tight but perhaps there could be more staff to ensure a quicker trip. I opted for the audio tour \u00a318.50, rather than the \u00a325.50 group tour. I fail to see how the group tour could be more informative than the audio tour. The information provided by the audio tour was very detailed and I left feeling that my knowledge of the building was greatly enhanced. I spent around an hour in the main hall, the amount of historical events that have occurred in the hall is sheet - Charles 1 trial, William Wallace's Trial, addresses by Nelson Mandela and the Queen. I then went into St Stephen's Hall which contained many exquisite mural paintings on the wall and statue of several historical politicians (all male at the moment!). Photos are permitted in the main hall and St Stephen's Hall but not thereafter. I then moved on to the central lobby, which contains statues of Churchill and Thatcher amongst others , and also a post office. It is the main lobby that leads into the Commons on one side and the Lords on the other. I then went into the House of Lords, much smaller than I thought, not allowed to sit on the seats. The Queen's throne is truly glittering and dazzling. There is then a surprising room containing paintings of monarchs past and present and paintings of the Battle of Waterloo. I then moved into the House of Commons, again quite small and was very excited to find myself in the place that so many debates and important votes took place. You are not allowed to sit on the seats but are able to freely wander between the seats and by the despatch boxes. Highly recommend this tour."

We've sat in the public gallery of both houses, and took a tour that allowed us to sit in the back benches of the House of Commons. We also got a (separate) tour of the Elizabeth Tower and stood by Big Ben as it chimed 12. (We had earplugs in!) Both tours were impressive.If you care about our democracy - indeed, if you cherish the fact that we HAVE one, however badly tarnished - then go. Get your MP to arrange the tour and it'll be FREE. Stand on the spot in the 900-year-old Westminster Hall where Charles I or William Wallace were put on trial, or where Winston Churchill lay in state before his funeral, look at the amazing ceiling that dates back over 600 years, and (if you're British) be thankful that you don't live in North Korea, Iran, Zimbabwe, China or a whole load of other places that don't have the democracy and freedoms we take for granted. The saying goes that 90% of politicians give the other 10% a bad name. This may be true, but at least we have some control over our politicians - as much through the embarrassment of adverse publicity as the ballot box - and it's quite humbling to stand in Westminster Hall and think of all the people - Chartists, Abolitionists, Tolpuddle Martyrs, Suffragettes, etc - who fought so hard for the freedoms we now enjoy. Go - and be moved; it's your democratic right."

It was well organized and they even accommodated our late arrival. The tour lasted about 90 minutes and took us through all the public spaces including the House of Lords and House of Commons with time in each for detailed explanations. We learned a lot which has already faded from my mind after a month but which was very enjoyable and informative at the time! The group was about 20 with no listening devices but we were able to follow along quite well and even my 81 year old husband heard most of it.Afterward, we had also arranged for afternoon tea (through the website) on a terrace overlooking the Thames, which was a slight disappointment. The venue was not a real room but a tent like enclosure with plastic windows and a noisy floor and everyone was being served at once which made for lots of servers walking back and forth constantly. Not very relaxing but the food was good and I guess it was good value at \u00a329 each compared to hotel teas. The view was fun.Anyway, great afternoon out in London.

Until last week I didn't even realise it was possible for lowly mortals to wander free inside our glorious seat of government, It came as quite a surprise, then, when I was invited to take a tour of the Palace of Westminster last week to discover that the building throbbed with school parties, and tourist groups from every corner of the world. MPs and Peers rubbed shoulders with the common herd as they went about the necessary tasks involved in running the country. Even the doors of the great debating chambers themselves are thrown open to visitors when not required for the business of the day. You can stand by the Woolsack in the Lords and see the marks on the table made by the signet ring of Winston Churchill as he hammered home his opinions. There on the doors themselves are the indentations made by Black Rod's staff of office. ( A black rod, one assumes) The decor in the Lords rivals any stately home in the land. Not so that of the Other Place, which is utilitarian and unassuming by contrast.On arrival, quite naturally, visitors are frisked comprehensively. (Don't wear oversized trousers, as you will have to relinquish your belt for the scanners.) The purified tourist is then disgorged into the echoing and ancient Westminster Hall, a marvel of pre-conquest archiecture not unlike the great dining hall at Hogwarts Castle. Brass plaques mark the spot where the great and glorious of the past were laid in state, or, in the case of the hapless Charles I, condemned to death.Arrive at the start of the day's business in the Commons, and you may observe The Speaker's procession into the house, heralded by a cry of \"Hats off, strangers!\" when even burly policemen hasten to doff their helmets. If men in tights are your thing, this is the moment for you. To tour the twin Houses of the British Parliament is an experience to be savoured. Souvenirs are available from the small gift shop, Lights snacks may be obtained from the cafe, but the highpoint of your visit, if the commons is in cession, will be visit the Public Gallery, the day's Order Papers in hand, and to watch for a while in reverent silence as the very wheels of government turn before your eyes down there below you, on the floor of the House.Take a conducted tour if you can, to discover the many quaint and curious facts about the place. (Did you know, for example, that it is against the law to die in this building?) Both an education and an entertainment, this is one day out every voter should experience at least once in a lifetime."

I scheduled the guided tour as soon as it was available online. It is a group of 15 people. Photos are limited to certain areas. The guide brought us \"behind the ropes\", we sat in the House of Commons, and walked corridors not open to the public. The tour was 2 hours and is an excellent personal experience. Allow time to get through the layers of security and bag checks. Go soak up history and you will not be disappointed. Highly recommend."

I am disabled and shuffled on with my walker past droves of people until I found myself at The Thames. There was no other gate. So I shuffled back, along with my niece who had a broken foot, only to be told tickets were available in an unmarked building 3/4 of a mile away. We had expended all our physical efforts by that point and got on a bus and left. All of this could have been avoided had their website been more informative, and their guard cared. It's the only London attraction where we've had a bad experience. I recommend they walk across the street to Westminster Abbey to see how it should be done."

The rooms and halls we visited had the most amazing decoration and paintings I have ever seen there was hardly a wall without something to see. As it happens I love history and for me to walk through the central lobby, in the lords chamber and to stand where the prime minister stands in the commons chamber is unbelievable, I have seen these spaces on TV and for me to be there I find incredible. Even if you don't find history and politics interesting the Houses of Parliament is still worth a visit as it is a magnificent building in its own right. The cafe and shop are reasonably priced."

Probably more interesting for Brits but there were a fair amount of foreigners attend. Be prepared to be searched as if you are going on a plane journey but liquids were not banned. Highlight for me was the House of Commons it is a lot smaller than it seems on TV and you can only imagine how noisy it would be when full. The other rooms were very grand especially the house of lords. You also see THE thrown used by the queen and various rooms and statues of past Prime Ministers. All this was brought to life by the guide."

The manager at the ticket counter told us no refunds and that our options were to catch up to the tour we had already booked or pay another \u00a351 for a different tour. We decided to try to run to catch up with the tour that was already underway. At this point, we were already a good 20-30 minutes into the 90 minute tour after having waited in line and having to run over to the actual entrance and go through security. An extremely kind usher took pity on us and wrote a note on our tickets to allow us into the next available tour. I am sooo grateful to him. Our tour guide Mike was absolutely wonderful. He was so enthusiastic and had great fun facts along the way. He did a great job getting the younger children involved and made what could have been a dry topic like how a bill becomes a law interesting and entertaining.

Our guide was wonderful, she was able to provide some behind the scene facts that you don't get from the self guided audio tours. Also as we visited during the anniversary of Shakespeare's death there was a rendition of one of his plays being performed in the great hall, which was an added bonus for us. Tickets can be purchased online or from the assigned ticket office, near new parliament house. a few points to remember. You must go through screening like at the airports so be careful what you pack. There are only a few limited places you can actually take photos do to privacy laws. Finally, the tour can take 2 hours, so comfy walking shoes and be aware that you can only sit when the guide tells you. the temptation to sit on the seats in both the house of lords & commons is frowned upon and security is ALWAYS watching"

Westminister Bridge is painted green as this is the common end of Parliament and Lambeth Bridge is painted Red as per the House of Lords. Although Parliament is a working site at the heart of the British Goverment, it is also a palace and a museum of sorts with amazing artefacts including paintings, statues and historical documents. If you are interested in cloak and dagger intrigue you can see the Visitors Book signed by Guy Fawkes.If you want to see both The House of Commons and the House of Lords you will need to book a tour with an official guide."

If you didn't know, the Palace of Westminster is where the House of Commons and the House of Lords meets. Apparently the first palace appeared on this site in the 11th century. Destroyed several times over (the last time by fire in 1834), this is the edifice that was built to replace it around 1840. The building is gorgeous, and the historical significance immeasurable."

It takes about 1.5 hours for the tour so, if you've booked the afternoon tea you will be looking forward to it. Sadly on our day the staff in the terrace restaurant appeared poorly organized as some people had their tea some 20-25 minutes before their food arrived whilst others seemed to received everything in good time. After being seated it took 20 minutes for our order to be taken although not quite so long again for the tea and food. I hope the tea service improves for others!"

A fact of too many places of interest these days, here and worldwide. Before you know where you are you're in the oldest part of the palace, Westminster Hall, the worlds widest medieval building, and the largest surviving part of the pre 19th century building. This huge space, scene for some of the biggest events in British history, is a great place to pause. Seeing MP's ministers and other parliamentarians pass, spot who you recognise and then pass on into building proper.If you get a chance go up to see the current debate from the visitors gallery in either the commons of Lords. You'll need to ask one of the many Police or ushers for help in the central lobby.We all think we know what the place looks and feels like from seeing it so often on the TV, but trust me when I say, nothing quite prepares you for seeing the opulence and incredible over the top decorations with your own eyes."

Emerging from the Tube at Westminster Station you're immediately struck by the majesty of the Elizabeth Tower and Big Ben. Security at Portcullis House was very efficient and we met our tour group in Westminster Hall. Seeing the plaques of the Kings and Queens and illuminates who lay in state there (Churchill) and who spoke there (Mandela) gave us chills (was also b/c it is freezing in there). Our guide was excellent, told us the history of what we were seeing and also much about the British parliamentary system. The House of Commons was smaller than it seems on television, the House of Lords was ornate and grand. I wished we had more time to stay and see the Commons in session - plan ahead to get tickets and go on a Wednesday so that you can see Prime Minister's questions (we were seeing a show so couldn't stay).

The guided tour was conducted by a female docent who was very knowledgeable regarding the proceedings of the working government. A different type of self-guiding tour was also available. But, I would advise to take the guided tour. You will be taking into more off-limit nooks and crannies of the building than on the self-guided one. The \"wow\" factor would be the Throne Room in the House of Lords."

They have to be dutiful and formal, yet manage to somehow make you feel utterly welcome and undaunted by the magnificence of the medieval Westminster Hall, the grandeur of St Stephen's Hall, or the opulence of the octagonal Central Lobby, in all its ornate Victorian Gothic splendour. Watching the House of Commons in action from the Public Gallery is always exciting, however prosaic the actual proceedings. MPs jumping up and down, trying to catch the Speaker's attention, the formalities of address, the antiquated traditions in this 21st century is a medley of old and new. Simultaneous TV relays with subtitles ensure you know which MP is speaking and what is going on.Even the caf\u00e9 is charming with interesting wraps and sandwiches and Twining teas. Sit by the window and watch the sun glittering on the top of Big Ben, and hear the famous chimes ring the quarter hours. Anyone can visit the Houses of Parliament. It's a fascinating place to see government in action."

Best to sign up online well ahead of time to speed things up when you arrive and also to ensure that there is availability. Arrive ahead of schedule and expect a long wait to get through security even though you've pre-booked. Bad luck if it raining (not that it ever rains in England) as you will find yourself out in the elements while you wait. It took us one hour, standing in the rain, from the time we first joined the line just to get into the building for security screening. For the most part, it is organised chaos until the tour starts but it is well worth the wait.

Don't worry, it's not all a history of which political party wanted what or anything like that: Parliament was definitely affected by the wars and fires that plagued many aspects of England's history. And visiting it definitely helped me orient and immerse myself in the background and culture of the area during my visit. Personally I found a tour of Parliament while the building was empty to be quite delightful and peaceful (a welcome relief given London's bustling sidewalks!). The architecture and artwork alike are stunning. The building and the massive halls inside of it are just gorgeous, and with a guided and/or audio tour you can enhance your experience even more by learning more about the history and governing process of Parliament."

Have your one-way system if you must, but please exercise some common sense or you may cause deep offence. We were there not to admire Pugin's tawdry, crumbling Victorian architecture or hark the echo of Bevan's oratory or ponder why there's an obvious dark stain on the front bench exactly where the PM parks himself, but to watch Richard II Act IV Scene 1 performed by young players from KES Stratford in Westminster Hall.

Unfortunately it was let down by the amateur organisation while trying to actually get in...as many people commented, it was as though this was the first time they'd opened the building to visitors!It's an important criticism as one of the tour options is a guided tour at set times during the day (the tours only run on Saturdays) and so anyone using this option to maximise their time in the city could face a problem. My tour was due to start at 1220 but, despite having arrived at 1145, the start time had long gone before I reached the airport-level security screening and eventually got underway almost an hour later.However, once we were on our way, this is a great way to the Mother of Parliaments. The Blue Badge Guide takes you through the fascinating history of the building itself as well as how parliament works. To actually stand in the famous chambers usually seen only on TV is a great experience although it should be noted that there is a rigidly enforced 'no photos' rule in all but two rooms (not the ones you'd like to take pictures of...) which is a bit of a shame."

When in London we made sure to walk past the Houses of Parliament which we were told were not currently open to visitors -- we were told the interior is open during the summer only when Parliament is not in session. Disappointing but an excuse to return during a different time of year.Walking around outside one finds tremendously beautiful gardens even in March, and the building itself is breathtaking. It is easy to see why Monet would paint the building more than once. I have liked Gothic architecture before I knew what the design was called so being up close and personal to this building was a real treat. The two towers are magnificent though of course everyone's favorite is probably the tower containing Big Ben. I did not know until I visited this spot part of the building survived a huge fire in the mid 1800s. Amazing to be able to incorporate the parts which survived into the present buildings.Other than up close and personal I would recommend viewing this building while walking across Westminster Bridge from the other side of the Thames. Before our trip around the building we were able to see the Houses of Parliament from the other side of the Thames as we were staying off Tower Bridge Road which gave us an opportunity to cross the Thames on more than one bridge.

Having seen the outside of the Elizabeth Tower for many a visit, I at least was thrilled to actually go beyond the black iron railings and into Westminister Hall. As expected you need to pass through security, but from then on once you have your audio guide you are free to wander back and forth. I was prepared for the size of Houses of Parliament, so many people in such a small space, but the bling effect of the House of Lords was a pleasant surprise, along with the closeness of the council chambers. The tour information was good and we spent 1.5 hours in the Palace of Westminster. You exit via a cafe - serving for London good value tea and coffee in old vaults - although no one was high me for arranging the trip, it has been talked about a lot since our return. Worth the effort, though on paper may seem a dull idea. Gift shop sold very expensive souvenirs."

Completed only 150 years ago it is no older than the US Capitol building, despite masquerading as being more historical. Also the design is a pseudo-mediaeval confection which was ill suited to the time it was built, pandering to Victorian beliefs about British history, and contains an inherent allusion to one of the hypocracies of the age: despite Catholic Emancipation in 1829, in the building there are no acknowledgements of the influence of Pugin, a Catholic Architect of note, who provided the character and detail to Barry's overal design. It is a now-crumbling anachronism providing no more than a theatrical backdrop. The sooner it simply becomes a museum and the UK parliament moves elsewhere the better. I think most MPs (apart from 'traditionalists' who really misunderstand 'tradition') would agree!"

The surroundings are opulent, Draped in maroon damask wallpapers with gold detailing on the columns with portraits of the current and past Speakers of the House going back to the 17th Century. The canap\u00e9s were delicious and just kept coming even after the Princess Royal had come and gone. Certain to be highly recommended as a set of function rooms for that most important event."

It is great to have the audio tour as you can replay the recordings to truly understand the actions that took place in history. It is amazing to believe that our history is shaped because of what actually put place in Lord and commons chambers.You can not take pictures in all areas as it is prohibited but you are welcome to take pictures in the common areas."

Despite being fairly pricey (at \u00a325 for adults and \u00a320 for students), the tour guide of the Houses of Parliament is well worth forking out for. Leaving every 20 minutes across the day the tour (which only runs sporadically throughout the year) gives you excellent knowledge about the place including taking you into various committee and lobby rooms that you can't visit if you don't have the tour. It takes about 1 hour, 45 minutes and the excellent lady that took us round was both informative and interesting, keeping our group of 14 or so engaged for the entire time. The history behind the building is fascinating as is the architecture, and the numerous sculptures, paintings and artwork.Would highly recommend!"

Once inside, it was very easy to work out where we needed to be. All the tours seemed to be running on time, so our tour started at the time that we expected. A very efficient process.We were shown around and told about the history of the building by our tour guide, Peter Clark. He was very knowledgeable about the building and British politics. Any questions that were asked, he knew the answer to. He also had a great sense of humour and appeared to be great with the younger children.Overall, it was an amazing visit and I would suggest it to anyone who is able to gain entry. The best way is contacting your local MP, who may be able to give you tickets free of charge."

We booked a tour guided visit which give us the full taste of this lovely place. Our tour guide had excellent knowledge of the history of this place and all its protocol(s), do's and don'ts etc....We had the full works on this visit as it was the Easter recess and we had been able to get into each of the Lords and Commons chambers, as well as seeing the Royal robing room and other areas not accessible whilst parliament is in session also some of the meeting rooms where normal day to day business is held. It was a joy to see my Granddaughter actually standing next to the Commons despatch boxes in the debating chamber with all its microphones around and some of the stories about how seating is arranged as even the PM doesn't actually have a specific seat assigned to him, I believe unless you go to prayers you cannot have a seat assigned. Wonderful, breathtaking and most enjoyable albeit that we spent almost 2 hours on this visit. I thoroughly recommend a guided tour when Parliament is in recess."

The highlight for me being the lords and common chambers, which are a lot smaller than they look on TV but you can still feel the import and weight of history around the place.The audio tour provided many fascinating bits of information on the construction, reconstruction of the building down the centuries, famous events to have taken place and the development of democracy and constitution in Britain.Highly recommended"

It is best to go when parliament is in recess.We were warned that the queue for security could be up to half an hour but we went straight through.We did the group tour and Phillip the guide was brilliant. He talked for an hour and forty minutes and it was fascinating. The afternoon tea on the terrace was also very good.The whole thing was good value.I also thought that the \u00a35 Official Guide from the shop was really worth buying to take home."

You follow a map through Westminster and St Stephens Halls, both chambers, the division lobbies, robing room. Takes about 1 and a half hours and more if you want to listen to the supplementary info. \u00a318.50 per adult and one free child per paying adult.

Known as the Palace of Westminster, I had been recommended visiting it, I had read about it on the Internet, I had seek information about it in London guides, ... but when my parents and I decided our visit, there was neither a guided tour nor an audio tour between 1 and 4pm. So, I strongly recommend (and that will be the option I will take on my future London trip) booking your choice in advance in order to go in and discover its awesome halls and rooms and learn about its past.Moreover, its views from the Westminster Bridge or from the London Eye are spectacular... It is a fabulous building and it reminds me to the Hungarian Parlament Building, because of its location and structure."

Although the current building is not that old because it was restored in the 19th century in the Gothic style it has a historical feel to the building once you are inside. There are impressive staircases, wood panels and reception areas with high ceilings which lends a sense of importance to the building. Security is tight so expect to queue for 10-15 minutes before you are checked which scanners etc. and eventually given a visitors badge for use while you are in the building. I was attending a meeting with my member of parliament in a committee room and found the security staff very helpful with directing me to the correct area for my meeting. At quieter times it is possible to go into the visitors gallery and watch proceedings on the floor of the House of Commons but at busy time such as Prime Minister's Question Time the gallery is always full. My visit was free but it is possibly to buy a guided tour to this facility."

A few tips: 1-- Get your tickets online ahead of time.2-- Show up well in advance of your tour time. The security lines are thorough and slow. Allow a minimum of 30 minutes to get in. 3--Get the in person tour (as opposed to the audio guide). The guides take you places you can't go with the audio guide alone. 4--Go in the a.m. You can't sit anywhere, so you want your legs fresh so you can stand for 2 hours. "

I know we are paying for the upkeep of the building and staff but i didn't realise that I was paying towards the MPs salaries/expenses as well!The tour took in all the sections of the Lords and Commons as well as the robing rooms and the artwork. It was very interesting in itself although the noise from the restoration of the floor made it sometimes difficult to hear what was being said.You are not allowed to take pictures except in 2 areas, and you are not allowed to sit on the seats of Lords/Commons at all. It is a shame as the houses were in recess and as such there was an ability to actually get into these areas.I would recommend that a self guided tour using audio would be better for most individuals to take advantage of a longer time to review and view.Booking is essential for his tour though"

So the guided tour we got was about 40 minutes later than the one we'd booked - but still worth every penny! It was so interesting and our guide was so informative, making all the details he gave us really interesting. I would definitely recommend paying the little bit extra for a guided tour rather than the audio tour - we went into a couple of rooms others couldn't access and could ask lots of questions as we went along. It took a bit longer than the advertised hour and a half and was certainly worth the wait."

It felt really special, we learnt loads, the children loved it, they knew this was a rare opportunity. I was impressed how much the staff cared and wanted to rectify things for us. We were enjoying the blue badge tour but it wasn't what we had booked. I've lived in London for years and never knew it was possible to even go inside the houses of parliament, I still wouldn't if I hadn't seen this special suffragette season advertised. I was amazed to see so many people inside, mostly doing audio tours but also guided tours in several languages."

For an old building, you'll never believe how young some areas are! There's lots of stories to hear, many that form the foundations of British society. My favourites are the suffragist who was resident for the 1911 census and the scratch marks made by the Horseguards. If you're really lucky and visiting in a group you can organise a private room for afternoon tea. Fabulous food and service in a very unique setting."

The building itself is hard not to fall in love with, the varying architecture which has evolved over the years, and the sheer fact the building is steeped in history.There is something for everyone on this tour, although small children might not appreciate what they are experiencing.I would recommend to anyone who is a history buff, interested in architecture, politics.

The staff seemed more interested in tidying up and the food was only passable- not even up to the standard I've had in hotels. Possibly this was because we were the last seating of the day.

From Guy Fox trying to blow the place up to the trial of William Wallace to stories of Margret Thatcher or simply learning how a vote is cast in the House of Commons, this place is outstanding."

Although we've visited London hundreds of times as tourists we have never seen inside the Houses of Parliament. Through our local M.P. we arranged an official tour. You can also book a prepaid tour. The tour was in a group of about 20, led by an excellent guide with a great sense of humour. It takes about 90 minutes and, because of protocol in both houses, you are not able to sit down unless you are disabled or infirm. From the perspective of an Englishman with a fascination for British history, this was a memorable day. I learnt so much about British political history and the relationship between the two Houses of Parliament and the British monarchy stretching back a thousand years."

The Houses of Parliament are a place that you really have to see when in London!At weekends and during recess you can pre-book tours online, and UK residents can request free tour tickets from their MP (but get in early - generally they book up 6mths in advance!).The tour offers an excellent look at both chambers of Parliament whilst giving an in-depth look at the work of Parliament and its history. Every tour guide we have had thus far has been extremely knowledgeable and they are happy to answer any question about the work of Parliament. Please do remember, though, that Parliament is a working palace and legislature. You will pass through airport-style security ran by the Metropolitan Police when you enter, and you will find a good number of police officers and security staff inside. You will also have to wear a visitor badge. When Parliament is in session, you will generally not be allowed outside of the 'public' areas unless escorted by a pass holder - but you can access the public galleries, Westminster Hall, the cafe, etc. even when Parliament is sitting. Outside of these times you will be able to explore the palace either with a tour guide or audio guide. If you're not happy with this then I would not recommend visiting - nor would I recommend visiting without pre-booking tickets. Also do note you will NOT be allowed to sit on the Parliamentary benches in the chambers so please don't try.The Palace is a great place to learn about democracy and its history in the UK - and it is in close proximity to other 'attractions' such as the Supreme Court and Westminster Abbey."

You take the tour and get the stand on the floor of both the House of Commons AND the House of Lords! Whoa! Mind blown! And the history of the place is simply amazing. All the funky little rituals that have grown up over the years are simply amazing (I'm just gonna say: Blackstaff!). Well worth the visit. And the Great Hall is a very impressive space, the chapel is simply beautiful and the House of Lords stunning in its richness (and fascinating in its contrast to the rather sparse House of Commons)."

The inside of the Houses of Parliament, including the House of Lords and Commons chambers, central lobby and the Old Great Hall are as beautiful as you may imagine from viewing the outside of this magnificent building. Charles Barry's design is amazing and intricate.The self-guided audio tour gives a lot of information to increase the enjoyment the visit. There is also a guided tour at various times of the day but we enjoyed the ability to go round at our own pace. We were able to go straight in with no queues (in comparison to the nearby London Eye attraction).Definitely a must see!"

It's worth a visit for the architecture alone, the rooms are full of brilliant paintings and statues. But you aren't allowed to take pictures inside which is a little bit annoying but makes you focus on what's being said. I would reccommend a visit to the public gallery of the Commons, even if there is no lively debate taking place it's still interesting to see how day to day parliament is run. If you visit on a Wednesday the chamber will be full and you can witness Prime Ministers Questions, although I expect it will be quite busy."

I had an audio guide which I prefer to a guided tour as you can take it at your own pace and re-listen to anything. There is so much to see and admire that sometimes you stop listening! I spent 2 hours walking around and learning so much about the House of Commons and House of Lords. No queues in February, so there were no holdups anywhere. Well priced cafe to visit before leaving. Good value for money."

We thoroughly enjoyed our visit hearing about the history of the building and the workings of Parliament. It is possible to tour independently using an audio guide. However, the guided tour is well worth paying for and you go into some rooms which you wouldn't see on the audio tour. Having said that we were a little disappointed that, following the tour we could not return independently to look more closely at display cases and objects. We hope to return again sometime when we will do the audio tour and view at our pace. There is an on site cafe and gift shop. As would be expected security is very tight on entry so allow time if you have a pre booked tour. The Houses of Parliament are well worth a visit but book in advance especially in Summer or if you have limited time in London."

Liz took us into rooms that were used only one day each year; rooms where the Queen herself is not allowed access; and rooms we had only seen on the telly -- all with an interesting, full explanation. The group was small (24 people, perhaps) so there was no problem hearing or following what was being said. Probably not of much interest to younger children, but the adults were awestruck and loved every minute. Highly recommended."

Tours cost 25 pounds ($38), takes about 75 minutes, and can be taken only when the Parliament is in recess during the summer. Best views for photos is across the river, so stroll across the bridge for a good pic. To get here, the nearest metro (tube) station is Westminster on the yellow, green, or gray line. If you plan on using public transportation more than twice per day, buy an Oyster Card (not a Visitor Oyster Card) for 5 pounds, then add 6.40 pounds per day since this is the daily cap for unlimited public transit use in Zones 1-2 (these zones encompass almost all tourist sights like Big Ben, Buckingham, Kensington, London Eye, etc).

Both my Wife and I decided to visit the Houses Of Parliament on our recent trip to London and we are sure glad we did!We decided to pre book our tickets in advance and it will save you time on the day of your visit as you are ushered straight into the security queue. For preparation, security is exactly the same as if you are at an airport!! The staff work hard and will get you through as soon as they can.We undertook the self guided audio tour. This was an excellent tour which started in the main hall and slowly guided you through the building passing through all the essential parts of this magnificent structure. There is too much information to describe everything, but our personal favourite was the House Of Commons!! This part of the building is where you get to realise that this is where everything that effects us as UK citizens starts in this part of the Palace Of Westminster. This was a fantastic part of the tour which throughout all the history of the building, this gives you a sense of the here and now! The next time we see it on the TV, we will see it from a different light that's for sure.From start to finish you get an understanding of politics and how processes work and how democracy started here in the UK many moons ago. A slow amble round taking in all the information will take around 2-3 hours. There is also a shop and cafe if you wish to use them and another well stocked shop on the corner opposite Big Ben.My belief is that every UK citizen if they get the chance should undertake a visit to the Palace Of Westminster! It is an absolute fascinating place and any visitor that comes to London, their monies would be well spent visiting a major part of British history and to which is still making history today........................"

Although a couple of the party had visited before, all enjoyed it immensely. The tour guide was excellent, setting a fast pace while imparting her profound knowledge with wit and enthusiasm. The only blip on an otherwise superb afternoon was the afternoon tea. if I said the best bit of this was the opportunity to walk some of the back corridors and peek into 1/2 rooms not on our tour, you will get the drift. So although I can say I drank tea in HoP I wish I had saved my money for the Berkeley or similar. If you haven't yet visited this is a must in London............go now!"

The first thing I noticed is the security staff is the best dressed in the world (seriously - wearing black tie and coat tails), the second is they're ever so polite and helpful. One of the staff took the time to explain how the building was a Grade I listed building. Catering in the restaurant was amazing (I had a curry stew - everyone I spoke to was impressed) and because the building in Grade I you can just imagine MPs of today and yesteryear dining in the same room. The corridors are lined with statues and works of art as a tribute to past contributors to English history. Highlights include Black Rod's ceremonial robes. One slight disappointment was a couple of patches of the floor was being renovated (as you would expect from such and old building with such heavy use)...that said one of the members of security shows me a recently renovated patch as comparison and it was clear the money was well spent.If you get the opportunity to visit the private gardens do so - despite being in Parliament Square, it is a place of peace and calm. I could barely hear the traffic. As I left the Houses of Parliament I felt so privileged."

Notwithstanding the slightly cynical view of politics that most of us have there is no getting away from the fact that, to paraphrase Churchill, our democratic process is the best of all. The Palace of Westminster is an amazing and absolutely beautiful building and even the most cynical will be hard pressed not to find its history compelling. Absolutely stunning setting for the two houses (Commons and Lords). The scene of so much that has influenced Britain and the World. Even in these waning years of global influence this British institution demands respect. Our tour was brilliant and the guide was so knowledgeable. She looked like she was a teacher that had stepped right out of a 1950s Belles of St. Trinians movie! kept group discipline and really she knew her stuff. It was tremendous to actually be in both the Commons and Lords (can't sit) and experience the atmosphere. Many years ago I had the opportunity to sit in on both houses but to be actually 'on the floor' was powerful.If you have a couple of hours, take the tour. It will reinvigorate your democratic demeanor. I don't think that it will sit too well with children, say under 14. I was a little disappointed that photography was strictly limited."

One of the most famous buildings in the world, known as the \"mother of parliaments\", and the beauty of its neo-gothic scale and detail by Barry and Pugin is simply breath-taking, what is equally impressive is that this is no dusty museum piece but a living and working hub of democratic government. Westminster Hall is a deeply evocative space not only because if its grandeur, but the historic atmosphere is almost tangible, the place of trials of Kings and traitors of martyrs and nobles, the audience chamber where Popes and Presidents have given addresses and where Kings Queen's and Statesmen have laid before burial. The House of Commons Chamber surprises by its intimacy but if you gain admittance during such as Prime minister's question time the atmosphere is electric, while the splendour of the House of Lords is truly regal, during a working day visits are limited but the buzz of MP's meeting constituents and frock-coated stewards bringing messages all gives a sense of living history"

The Westminster Hall (nearly 1000 years old) was the first stop on the tour before being allowed to wander further and further into the ornate hallways and chambers of intricately carved Seraphs, Bishops, Kings, Queens and Noblemen/women. Learning about the process of democracy from the time of William the Conqueror to David Cameron will not disappoint any cultured and insightful traveller. I would highly recommend booking the Afternoon Tea Special at the Terrace Pavilion to conclude your tour - the view of the Thames, the London Eye and Westminster Bridge is perfect on a clear summer's day from this Pavilion on the side of the Palace of Westminster!"

The building is stunning. Most of it went up in the 1840s, and it is all very ornate and beautiful. It certainly succeeds in reminding one of the power of the British Empire. Just about all that remains of the original Palace of Westminster is Westminster Hall, which hails from the twelfth century. It's one of those places that makes me feel very keenly the presence of the innumerable figures from British history who walked its floors. Our tourguide was very knowledgeable about both the physical building and the business of Parliament. As we have found in many historic British attractions, there was also a very good food service in the lower level, offering a variety of sandwiches, sweets and drinks. This was a really fascinating 90 minutes, and I strongly recommend a visit."

For UK residents, free guided tours of the Houses of Parliament, or to be more precise, the Palace of Westminster can be arranged in advance through your local M.P. or a member of the House of Lords. Not knowing who many of the Lords and Ladies are who sit in the House of Lords, we applied to our local M.P. Within a few days we received a reply confirming the date and time that we could do the tour. Non-UK residents can apply to do a similar tour for a fee and can apply for tickets online. As one might expect with a place like this, there were some security checks to go through upon arrival for the tour, akin to airport security. We were then allowed in to Westminster Hall, the oldest part of the Palace of Westminster. When it was time to begin the tour, our guide introduced herself and welcomed our group of about 25. There were a small number of rules to follow, but nothing too onerous: keep up with your guide, don't dilly-dally and most importantly, don't sit down in the Chamber of the House of Commons or the House of Lords! Only members of the Commons or Lords are allowed to take a seat in the relevant Chamber. Photographs can be taken \"... for personal, non-commercial purposes\" in Westminster Hall, St Stephen's Hall and New Palace Yard but not in other areas within the palace boundaries. After all, this is an important working environment. The guided part of the tour lasted about 90 minutes and ended back at Westminster Hall. We then had a look round the gift shop and had a bite to eat in the adjacent Jubilee Cafe. Given the long march of history at this location, it is an honour to follow in the footsteps of so many historic figures, and not just English or British ones. For example, there are brass plaques on the steps of Westminster Hall marking the place where some of the great figures of history have stood, such as King Charles I, Queen Elizabeth II and President Nelson Mandela. What were the highlights of the tour? Firstly, there was a close-up view of one of the finest examples of the 19th Century 'Gothic revival', the vision of Charles Barry and Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin. Secondly, there is the privilege of standing in a place that has played an important part in history and the democratic tradition. Thirdly, after visiting the Palace of Westminster, I felt I had a better understanding of how the Queen's Government works. After the visit of the Houses of Parliament there was the added bonus of a free tour on the same day of the nearby 'Jewel Tower'. All told, it had been a memorable day steeped in English and British history."

The way the staircases wind throughout the whole structure - creating maze after maze with every wall and landing decorated with historical busts of previous Prime Ministers and paintings of various Lord this or Duke that. The feel of it is best described as - more Hogwarts than Hogwarts itself. I half expected Wormtail to scurry past my feet at any given point but luckily this did not happen.The traditions that have existed within the walls that wrap around the outside of the Houses of Parliament have been there for many hundreds of years and although parts of the building does look slightly haggard; I believe this dated and dilapidated look alongside the seasoned traditions adds to the charm and character of the place.The fact that the plumbing is so dated and slightly dysfunctional also probably is quite apt as I imagine some of the regular visitors mirror the problems with the plumbing and the building in their own decrepit bodies. Bless them though as they still go in and scream \"hear hear\". Not because they are agreeing with something mind you but because they probably want to let every one there know that they have indeed been able to make the journey from their second home successfully and are indeed present."

You can also book tickets online or by telephone. We had the time for the 90 minute guided tour, but considered the 60 minute audio/self-guided tour. During the tour, we found that the guided tour goes some places the self-guided tours do not. Do allow at least 5-10 minutes before your tour time to go through security and find the correct meeting location of the tour (the tour meeting area was a bit disorganized). About 25 people compose each tour group.The tour started by following the path the Queen would take when she arrives to open Parliament. Our guide did a good job explaining the history and the structure of the buildings and the government. She added info on current activities, and little tidbits along the way (e.g., the uniform for the Doorkeepers in the House of Commons includes a badge that is considered part of the Crown Jewels). Overall, I felt the tour was definitely worth the price and time. Pictures are not allowed in most of the tour, which is a bit disappointing, but understandable."

If you do the same, the ticket office is across the road (not Parliament building itself) and then allow time to get through the security checks. For me, the guided tour put everything in context in terms of parliament's history, the main players in its foundation over the centuries, exactly how it all works and why - I thought I knew a fair bit but it seems not. I didn't appreciate that most of it was rebuilt, and to look old, in Victoria's reign, or that MPs had to ballot for a seat to sit on ('cos it's not as big as it appears on TV), and so may other things. Our guide was exceptionally knowledgeable in its history and its complex machinations.There's no photography throughout, although I can't fathom why; it's not like they sell their own photos or anything. But there is a good cafe on the way out which isn't in any way expensive - \u00a37 for 2 coffees, a sandwich and a cookie. I'd recommend this tour."

You have a choice between a self-guided audio tour and a live guided tour. The guided tours get into places the self-guided tours don't, are more personal and offer the chance to ask questions.Mary Parker, who looks a bit like Dame Judi Dench, was our wonderful guide. She was expert, as you would expect, at bringing the history of the palace to life. But she also incorporated current activities into her commentary, making it clear this is still the working seat of UK government where momentous decisions are debated and decided (the contentious vote on British bombing of ISIS had just concluded a couple days before our tour). She wove her wonderful understated sense of humor throughout her talk. This was no dry historical lecture. The tours are only available on Saturdays, or when Parliament is in recess. If you are in London when the tours are being conducted, make the time to take one."

The latter was built by Edward the Confessor in the eleventh century and served as a royal residence until 1512. Afterwards it became the permanent home of the English parliament and the seat of the Royal Courts of Justice.The houses of parliament were gutted by fire in 1834 and subsequently reconstructed in neo gothic style by architect Charles Barry and decorator August Pugin. The houses of parliament can only be visited on certain days and tickets come with a timeframe. Therefore I recommend ordering your tickets online in advance.In most areas photography is prohibited.Visitors can discover the houses of parliament either with the help of an audio guide or by enlisting for a guided tour. The rating reflects my relative disappointment in the visit. I was keen on learning about the medieval royal palace and hoped to visualize its former splendor via reconstruction drawings and scale models. I had also hoped to obtain detailed information about the beautiful neo gothic interior and facades. Who did the many statues represent ? What topics were chosen for the paintings and reliefs and why ? What scandals and dramas had occurred within these walls ?However, explanations focus on the legislative work of the houses of parliament. Information about their composition, daily work and voting methods alternate with audio comments of deputies. I guess this is mostly appealing to British visitors.In retrospect I would not book a tour of the houses of parliament again and I encourage you to rather spend your time in London wandering the various districts with the help of a good travel guide."

As you'd expect there's quite a bit of walking and not that many places where you can rest your feet for a few minutes so just be wary of that.

It was great to inside what we normally see on the TV, but we could not sit down on any of the seats.We went through the areas where the Queen gets ready for her one visit and saw the area where Queen Victoria sat.

My visit was a special one after I asked my local MP if it was possible she could arrange a visit in particular also attend PMQ's. At this time I was unaware that there were public tours allowed. Fortunately I received a reply and given a date.We arrived at Portcullis House on the due day and after going through severe security checks was met by my MP's PA. She explained that my MP was busy and that she (the PA) will give us a personal tour.We started off in Westminster Hall the oldest building on the Westminster Estate, 900 years old. The Hall was built in 1097 under William II (Rufus), the son of William the Conqueror. Many Historic characters were put on trial here.At the end of Westminster Hall is St Stephen's Hall which stands on the site of the royal Chapel of St Stephen's, where the House of Commons sat until the Chapel was destroyed by the fire of 1834. We did not go into the House of Commons as members were sitting but we did visit the House of Lords and saw the Woolsack, the Queens Throne for the opening of Parliament, and of course the Red benches. From here we were walked through the library then on to The Reading Room, The Central Lobby the MP's Restaurant and were allowed a quick peek onto the Terrace over looking the River Thames. At this point my MP arrived and escorted us around the portrait paintings that are displayed in Portcullis House.Finally we were escorted to the Visitors Gallery where we stayed for that Wednesdays PMQ's.This visit was very very special in terms of curiosity, history, architecturally. I am not sure how a public visit varies from our own but the PA did say we have seen some parts of Westminster that the public organised tours do not see.I would thoroughly recommend this it has so much history much more than I can quote here, it would be very educational for anyone including children."

When you have seen enough, you may leave when you wish - most take 30 to 45 minutes to take it all in although this will need the co-operation of those sitting alongside you to do so as the upholstered benches are quite close together.

Do what you're told and you'll be through in no time. We were greeted by our guide, Mary, who asked us all where we were from so she could personalise the tour. She was an outstanding guide giving us insights from the art, to parliamentary protocols, to anecdotes from days gone by - all peppered with humorous tales of misbehaving MPs. She was enthusiastic and friendly and answered any questions.The tour takes you through all the places you want to see and then some! Incredibly well-organised and efficient.The tour took around 2 hours and was arranged very well - there were several other tours going round but it didn't feel crowded or that we were fighting for space.Would highly recommend. And each tour guide had their own tales to tell so you could easily go more than once.The best place I've visited in London."

Our guide was excellent and gave some very interesting detail about the history of the old palace and the workings of the present day parliament. It was fascinating to see the rooms where Parliament meets and some of the other rooms and chambers. The tour lasted about 75 minutes which was about right. The only \"issue\" was that there were several tours all at the same time so it was at times difficult to hear everything. We did not do it but you can also go into the visitors galleries without queuing when the Houses are sitting. There can be long queues at times"

He took great pains to find out where people were from and he then used that on the tour to talk about their MP or the parliament in their home country. The tour lasted about 1 hour 50 minutes. The only thing I need to point out is that you aren't allowed to sit down at all apart from 3 short stops on the tour. It makes it hard on your back for certain people but it was worth putting up with a creaky back the next day as it was so interesting."

It was an amazing experience to soak up the history and ceremony of the place, in the knowledge that this is the seat of power for the UK and has so much history behind it. Surprisingly the Commons Chamber and the Lords Chamber looked smaller than I expected but still impressive. The guide was very knowledgeable and could answer all questions asked of him - probably through years of experience. The tour took about an hour and a half, and covered everything from the thousand year-old Westminster Hall at the start of the tour all the way through the various parts of the House - the Norman Porch, Queen\u2019s Robing Room, Royal Gallery, Prince\u2019s Chamber, Lords Chamber, Moses Room Central Lobby, Members\u2019 Lobby Aye Lobby, Commons Chamber St Stephen\u2019s Hall....too much to take in, and fantastic history, architecture and ceremony. A word of caution - there is a fair amount of walking and standing involved although there are some areas to sit. Security (as you would expect) is tight and ID is required, with Airport-style security scanning (although much stricter than some airports I have encountered!)"

Simply amazing, and the guides invited our questions and tried to answer them as best as they could. Our visit came an especially apt time as the Lords had just blocked a central piece of government legislation earlier the same week. Barry and Pugin really did do a brilliant job, but now the building is in need of a \u00a35 billion restoration which poses major challenges to the nation. Still, it is surely a major highlight of any tourist's London itinerary, and should remain so, including of course the National Gallery which houses Turner's sketches of its predecessor burning down in 1834 (the resulting 2 oil canvases are sadly in Philadelphia and Cleveland)."

It seemed complicated.Today, I see the Houses of Parliament made of brick and mortar. It looks unreal with every inch cut, crafted, chiseled, and etched as it stands majestically on the Thames River. What a sight to behold. Unsurpassed beauty. Exquisite.I slowly walk around the entire perimeter soaking and savoring every detail of the House. I spend hours committing to memory the wondrous beauty. I feel utterly privileged. I do not want to forget this moment. It will comfort me when I am old and no longer mobile. My eyes see. My hands touch. My mind absorbs. Yet, it all seems imaginary.

All we can say is that our observation was that the live tour takes you through pretty rapidly but on the snipets we heard, gives you a bit more of a colourful commentary than does the audio guide. We actually paused our informative audio guide to listen to whatever live tour was in the room when we arrived there, then resumed the audio guide to see things in more detail. This worked well and gave us something of both commentaries. Note that the signs at the very beginning of the tour (before & after security) saying photos are prohibited are actually misleading, as photos ARE permitted inside Westminster Hall, and the ban only starts when you leave the hall.Book online well ahead as tours occur only each Saturday and they fill up as a consequence."

At first the indications were positive - a possible refund - circumstances beyond our control - or a possible credit/rebook. But - a week later and after having to chase up on promises of a response never received - I'm told 'there's nothing we can do'.

This means the waiting staff have a very large number to serve during the hour slot you have booked. The cream tea was very nicely presented and looked great but the portions are VERY small to say the least. You do NOT get your tea refilled and they use TEA BAGS !!! and have limited choice of teas. We have done many cream teas in London and this was both VERY expensive and disappoint especially the use of tea bags at this level of cost. Service was POOR as we were one of the last to be seated and therefore the last to be served. Most people spent less than 30 mins in the tea room which reflect the quality of the offering :-(I would recommend you enjoyed a trip around the House to see the history but go elsewhere for a cream tea."

The building is incredible with stunning stained-glass windows, wood-panelled lobbies and vaulted ceilings. In addition to the famous House of Commons and the House of Lords, there are many other areas to explore. Westminster Hall makes for an impressive start to the tour. St Stephen's Hall, where the Commons uses to meet and where William Wilberforce pleaded for the abolition of the slave trade, is ornate and beautiful. The octagonal Central Lobby is exquisite and there is even a small post office inside.The tour is available on Saturdays throughout the year and on recess. I would certainly recommend it."

The audio tour provide me with all the details of history of the building along with adequate information about the style and decor of the various rooms. I did find meeting groups with the tour guides off putting as frequently met groups who just surged through and on two occasions almost knocked myself and a friend down. They guided tour groups appear to feel they have total right to surge forward at will. This aside I did enjoy the visit. Afterwards we visited the coffee shop - the queue was quite long and the wait for coffees was quite long. I think this was due to a limited space as it may be better to serve the coffees in a different place rather than at the till. Choice of food was adequate and the price was ok too. The gift shop was very limited - certainly I was not encouraged to buy anything but this may depend on the \"tourist\""

We were able to ask questions and overall would highly recommend a guided tour over an audio self paced tour, it is just not the same. This tour starts with getting through security that is efficient and friendly. You're provided a guest pass and make your way in. Our guide met us and at first it seemed like we were just moving too fast but he did tell us we would return through the same areas but we were literally the first group in. There is amazing history and information about the architecture while sharing how Parliament works. I highly recommend this tour for those that enjoy history, government, architecture and want to experience British political culture as well as those that enjoy just learning something they may not otherwise know. At the end there is a caf\u00e9, gift shop, toilets and upon exit you return your pass. Overall a great tour, we booked ahead online as we wanted to ensure we took a guided tour, it is well worth booking in advance and paying a bit more."

The audio guide is very good and gives you more than enough information. The tour is numbered in a set sequence, so you can't go wrong. And you are given a paper guide too, which tells you where you can sit down etc. The tour takes a good 1.5 hours with a few sit downs along the way. When I went, it was quiet and there was no queue or waiting time or queue at security. I had prepaid for my tickets online, which is advisable, printed off at home and turned up. You pick the time you want. This means you can go straight to the entrance and you are guaranteed entry. I also went when parliament was in recess, this is the best time to go, as you can see everything including the lords and commons chambers, you won't be able to go into these if the house is sitting of if you get a tour through your MP. Only negative \u00a318 a bit steep for audio tour, \u00a325 for tour with tour guide. I have been to a few other parliaments in Europe and it cost me nothing."

Both visits were delightful and enlightening. We were all fascinated by the history of the Palace and the various aspects of the British Parliament. Amazingly, seeing 'the seats', 'left' and 'right' and two 'houses' made the abstract ideas much more accessible to our kids and allowed for an interesting discussion on various forms of government (we're not British). We also used YouTube videos to show them the Houses in action.So make your reservations in advance, allow for 1-2 hours, depending on the type of visit you chose and ENJOY.I highly recommend combining the visit with a walk up Whitehall St., through 10 Downing St., the pubs etc. up to Buckingham Palace. I think it allows for a deeper experience of the British government."

Like many people we have seen images of the House of Commons on TV and in pictures but we had a strange desire to see it for real. Our local MP Ann Milton was contacted about a visit to the public gallery of the House of Commons and a guided tour of the whole Palace of Westminster. Through her office we arranged a morning to view the action in the House and a full personal tour of the Houses of Parliament in the afternoon.Although the subject of debate was not over exciting watching the process was. The polite terms of address - The Honourable Member - and the ordered process of speaking was strangely pleasant. The casual seating positions, and the apparent slumping to one side as if asleep but was to help the slightly hard of hearing put their ear nearer to the installed small speakers in the seats, gave the impression of relaxed attention to the processes. However it was clear that there was full attention to the procedure when an MP (no names) sought permission to speak and express a very firm opinion to what had been previously said. I would urge you to make the effort to experience this especially with children and young people to experience the democratic process first hand"

Besides covering the history, role of royalty, and the functioning of the parliament, the guide also gave lots of little fun tidbits about the place.

Staff guided us through the entrance route to the security points (like an airport). You report to a tours desk in the enormous Westminster Hall and there is the cafe and souvenir shop to one side off the Hall. The tour guides take you on a standard route that they can't adjust. You'll get to all the main spaces, Commons, Lords and Royal chambers but none of the back room areas. There is a Post Office counter in the central lobby (a surprise). Everyone on our tour thought the Commons and the Lords chambers were smaller than they imagined.Wheelchair users were able to be taken round (four on our tour) but they often had to be taken to private area lifts and then rejoining the tour.The lavish details are so impressive."

We decided to go for the Guided tour and were asked what time we wanted to start. Tours were timed at 20 minute intervals. After buying the tickets, the ticket office is across the road from Parliament, we made our way to the visitor entrance. We then went down to be screened, X-ray and metal detector, just like airport screening, and were ushered into Westminster hall to start our tour. Our guide was very knowledgable and took us to the furthest point of the building and guiding us back. The tour covers the areas used by the Queen at state opening, the chamber of the Lords, central lobby and commons chamber, as well as other areas. The tour lasted around 90 minutes and was very informative. We ended back at Westminster hall and a well stocked gift shop. This tour is wonderful and very worthwhile. The tour cost \u00a325 per adult but was well worth it. The guide book was also good value at \u00a35. I would recommend to anyone."

Very grateful to my MP for organising it, and to the Tour organisers. You have to queue for a bit to get to security and then you are fairly swiftly through the airport security (I was frisked, and my partner was told off for going through the metal detector too soon afer me. Security could be a bit more polite, we are not trying to be difficult!). Then we spent some time in the cafe, saw the little shop, toilets are in this area, and then into the vast Westminster Hall to gather for the tour. We loved it once we'd got through security (and we do understand the need for excellent security). A super tour, thank you."

We had a most excellent 2 hour tour of the Houses of Parliament with Fernando and I would give this 5 stars and thoroughly recommend it.Our experience was rather devalued by the afternoon tea, of which we had high expectations. Everyone who had booked the afternoon tea was taken to the dining room together at the same time and then everyone was served (kind of) simultaneously. And this clearly presents catering with a challenge, so everything is prepared well in advance. As a result our sandwiches were cardboard-dry as they had been standing out waiting for our arrival for far too long (the waiter explained this to us when we made a comment).Significantly the portions were super-tiny (three tiny, tiny, tiny sandwiches, one small scone and two other tiny desserts each - the desserts were delicious, but the sandwiches were tasteless as well as dry). And rather strangely the waiting staff gathered in the menus before we'd been able to select another pot of tea because clearly none of the diners could be trusted! I confess it did make me feel like I wanted to be mischievous.I could go on, but suffice to say at \u00a327.50 per person (in addition to \u00a325pp for the guided tour) it was all about the location rather than the tea so I would recommend you go to on the tour and give the tea a miss."

I recommend a guided tour as they tell you all about the palace, its history and you learn so much more than just walking around with an audio set as you can ask questions as you go. The tour takes an hour and a half or so and you get to see the house of Lords, Commons and other areas.Well worth it if you can get in on a small group of 12 like we had but apparently they can have up to 30 on a tour so may make it a little less personal.

Prior to entering the building you will pass through the. equivalent of airport security with the usual restrictions on what you may not carry. The audio tour controllers are easy to use and in addition to the 20 way points extra information is available by typing in additional codes. The extra information includes the trials of Guy Fawkes, Thomas More and Charles 1st. The commentary is a good balance between history and current running of parliament and covers several key aspects of our developing democracy like the Civil War, the role of the monarchy and the fight for women's suffrage. Friendly, well informed staff are on hand to answer any questions.Booking for a mid morning tour reduces your risk of congestion in the main building or the pleasant cafe and shop. Our visit lasted two hours."

I have been on a tour here, world here, visited for events and conducted tours. The history is just awesome. Nothing quite takes your breath away like walking for the first time into the House of Lords, with all the gold. You can visit a debate for free in either the Lords or Commons by queuing outside. Parliament has done a lot of work in recent years making the building more accessible to the public, and have a cafe for visitors at the Cromwell Green entrance. They do weddings, and afternoon tea. You can book a tour of the building, climb up the Elizabeth Tower with a guid, and even lobby your MP. The architecture is just awesome. There is a gift shop which sells everything from watches to wine either Lords or Commons branded. UK Parliament is so unique and will never disappoint a visitor, every British citizen should visit at least once. Even with a wheel chair it is possible to see round the building, disabled visitor will see things from a slightly different angle because wheel chairs weren't top priority when the building was built, but it is possible to visit for those less mobile."

The interior is so beautiful and it really brought all those history lessons to life. The Houses were much smaller than I had expected, but it was all so interesting. It was a fantastic experience - I now want to return to hear the guided tour, which seemed to give different information when I managed to overhear.The cafe was a bit pricey - I know it's London, but maybe that's why it was empty! We were both really impressed by the Police Officers on duty at the entrance, and the security staff inside - all so pleasant and friendly. The security checks here were handled with far less drama than those at the Sky Garden!"

As parliament had not resumed we got to see all of the House of Lords and commons. You get to see it all and stand in the same room and spots as he queen and the PM. I don't have a massive interest in politics but I loved the tour. The rooms are amazing and the design and attention to detail is amazing.

The Elizabeth Tower which houses Big Ben is only open to residents of the UK. But as it's several hundred steps to the to, no complaints here.

Our guide, Colin, who happened to be from our constituency, was very knowledgeable on the history of the Palace of Westminster and very entertaining. He regaled us with lots of stories and funny anecdotes. You can't fail to be impressed by the grandeur and sense of history hanging over the place. It's a must-see, no question!"

This must rate as one of the most enjoyable visits so far,everything was spot on & amazing.I had watched the fairly recent documentary on the BBC,and this gave such a behind the scenes eye opener about this ancient political building.We booked our tickets on line,and just printed things off before we made our maiden visit.After checking in at the gate you go through to the security area,this takes just a few minutes & then you are on your way for your tour.You can take photo's in the great hall,but after that sadly you are not permitted to take any more.I say sadly because it is just so special when you are walking through the various rooms that you have previously only seen on tv.There is just so much political history to step back in amazement and enjoy,to think that you are actually walking just a few feet away from where Mr David Cameron, our current prime minister deliver all of those witty lines.!Of course we may like some of the members more than others,but at least we get the chance to vote them in & out when our chance comes.The house of Lords is just as impressive,as you get to see the leather benches where one or two peers have a been caught having a mini nap on tv.Loads of statues for you see & wonder which name is going to appear under it to reveal that illusive former prime ministers name.Summing up,a brilliant place to visit at the very centre of British politics.The entrance fee for two seniors was \u00a331.00,so at \u00a315.50 this represented great value for the entertainment value alone.Would we come again,without a doubt,this was so very,very good.Thank you to all of the helpful staff on duty."

I visited the HOP for the very first time despite living here, with my 12 year old daughter, and was not disappointed. We chose the audio self tour instead of a guided tour, but having seen the guided tour would also highly recommend it. With plenty of time to wander round and with an excellent array of historical background to listen to in addition to the guide, this was a history diploma in the making, for me anyway...!! My daughter was, to coin an american phrase 'just blown away' by being at the heart of the british political system, something I think we take for granted seeing it on TV etc.It was awesome and something I want to do again as soon as possible. The highlights for me were St Stephens Hall, House of Lords, and House of Commons. St Stephens Hall because of its rich history dating back to the first Commons Chamber which once stood on this site, which is why the present hall is lined with 12 marble statues of famous Members of Parliament facing each other, as in debate. The House of Lords and House of Commons also intriguing and surprising, given that they both are much smaller than they appear on television....!!Overall, an excellent visit and even though you have to go through stringent security for good reason, this is done so efficiently and courteously that you hardly notice..!!So Highly recommended if you are at all interested in politics, history or political history ..!"

During our tour we were able to enter both the House of Lords and House of Commons and walk amongst the member benches. My wife is English and I am American and we both truly appreciated the history of the surroundings and the events that have taken place there.If you can arrange a tour even without the tea, please do not fail to do so.

Once you've been through airport style security you enter the main hall, where you're met by your guide. This is a fascinating tour, make sure you wear very comfortable shoes and be prepared to walk/stand for up to two hours. The guides are generally excellent and will share vast amounts of key historical facts and figures. Some have a delightful sense of humour. You're taken through the main hall and reception areas, where history and architecture are explained. Then in to the Lords and Commons - but don't sit on the benches!!!!!! Only the elected (or privileged) can do that. Your guide will explain why monarchs can't enter certain rooms, where decisions are made, where plotting took place, and you'll even file through as if taking a vote (eys to right, no's to the left), passing age-old Hansards on the way. You will generally get a sense of how the house works, given an ancient system in a modern world. Assuming parliament is not in recess then you'll probably see some of your representatives rushing about. If it were my decision I'd ensure every UK citizen got to visit here at least once, it's not only politically and historically fascinating, it's also architecturally fab. There's a small retail area on the way out, but no catering facilities, but plenty outside."

Through the House of Lords in all its grandeur - (recalling associated recent scandals) - and on to the various interconnecting rooms that lead to the House of Commons.

The guide was excellent and provided a ton of great information during the 1.5 hour tour. Although she did editorialize a bit when we came to Margaret Thatcher's statue. There were only a very few opportunities to sit down during the tour, so if you're feeble and cannot stay on your feet for long, I'd skip it. There's seating everywhere, however they strictly prohibit you from sitting on it. This site is well worth a visit to catch a glimpse into how the UK government works and where the big decisions are made.

The only slight disadvantage is that you can't go at your own pace but a guide makes the whole place come alive. We may return some time and take the audio tour so we can take everything in. Also we had a number of people tag along so our group increased from 23 to 33. This was irritating as they hadn't paid for the tour. The organisers need to have some system eg stickers or bands so the guide can keep a check on who should be in their group."

Had it not been for my visiting teenage niece and her best friend, I would never have given over my precious free time to visit The Houses of Parliament, or to give it its proper name, The Palace of Westminster. Our guided tour was very affordable, well structured and very informative. The guide began with the narrative of the opening of Parliament and thus begun our journey into the history of the building, the architect and artisans whose imagination created this marvellous building as well as the people whose influence still affects our daily lives. Then we learnt about The House of Lords through to the devolution of powers from the Monarchy to the representatives of the people in The Commons. Walking through both Houses which I have seen on TV many times, I couldn't believe how small and intimate both chambers were. This 1:45-2:00+ hour tour is tiring on the legs especially since visitors can only sit in allocated places which is torture when stood amongst the leather benches in both Houses! The 200 year old interior decor with its dark frescos, portraits, sculptures and paintings suspend your disbelief that this is still the most important working building in 21st Century United Kingdom! This tour is designed to keep old and young interested while you learn about how our emancipation has come about and why the continuation of antiquated rituals is so important to both Houses, even if they have little relevance to those outside of Parliament. Then take a boat trip from Westminster Pier (minutes away) to Greenwich Pier to see the fast vanishing Thames river history before this too vanishes under the modern glass edifices of \u00a3million offices and apartments. Highly recommended, no matter what the weather!"

He was amusing and knowledgeable and encouraged questions from we visitors. He was made even the youngest to the oldest of us feel like we were on our own private tour, even though there were 25 of us.We started in the great Westminster Hall where monarchs and world leaders have made historic speeches under the huge hammer beam roof which has stood since 1399...through fires, terrorist plots and two cataclysmic world wars. Kings and Queens and great men have laid in sate there as well as others being tried and heard their death sentences. You really feel you are standing in a huge room that has seen history unfold since the 11th century and continues to do so.We were then taken to the Robing room and the magnificent House of Lords...a wonderful testament to Pugin who oversaw so much guilding (23.5 c!) and colour that it makes the viewer stand in awe.The House of Commons was next and then the rooms where the respective MPs go to indicate how they are voting. I have lived in London most of my life and at last understand totally our voting system thanks to Tony our tour guide.The building is full of paintings of pivotal moments in the history of Great Britain stunning statues and busts of it's leaders everywhere you look.

The audio guide is very good, has so many details, and there are a few places where you can seat, listen and admire the building. Is very well organized, it's not a long tour (1-1.30hrs) but it's excellent. It doesn't matter if you know about England history and politics or not you will definitely enjoy it. The visit to the Lords Chamber and the Commons Chamber was the best part for me, but there are plenty of highlights such as the Royal Gallery and Westminster Hall. The dates and times for visiting are very specific so make sure to check their website to see available dates."

There was quite a lot of noise in some areas as the floor was being renovated so we had to wear headphones.

A fascinating tour where we learnt a great deal about the evolution of the Palace's from Westminster Hall to what it is today. All perfectly finished off with Afternoon Tea (extra price & ticket booking required 27.50 pounds + extra for champagne) served on the Terraces. Best Afternoon Tea we had this visit, magic!"

It is hard to understand why photographs cannot be permitted in at least some parts and the latter can be a challenge for older or less ambulant visitors. Tour guides are knowledgeable and very helpful but move at a pace that sometimes prevents visitors from simply standing a while to enjoy or examine architecture, statues, paintings etc in more detail."

For the second time in just under two years I had the honor of beinginvited to the House of Commons as a guest of one of the Membersof Parliament, who like me had attended the London School of Economicsand Political Science. The purpose of the visit was to attend a Gala Dinnerto be held in the Members Dining Room on Saturday, 11th.July, 18.30pm. I journeyed by rail from Northampton's new railway station, which is now very modern, and purchased, a first-class ticket to Euston station on Friday 11th. July, 2015, using London Midland, as I had booked a room at the London Holiday Inn, Mayfair. On the day of the Gala Dinner, I hired a taxi from the hotel to the Houses of Parliament andfound the taxi fares had again increased, so it is an expensive means of travel. A London red bus would have been too difficult given the route.The Houses of Parliament are a wonderful monument to the democracy of the country, but now face a huge cost for having the buildings refurbished and broughtinto the 21st.century for internal use of telecommunications and all the relatedfacilities for running a government. On arrival I found security to be extremely highand after a thorough search we were allowed in suing the Black Rod entrance.Guests were treated top a lovely chilled glass of champagne or an orangejuice as an option. The ambience of the building is unique and before the Galadinner we were treated to a guided tour of the premises. On my visit in 2014 I hadnot en joyed that privelege. The tour was most enlightening and I was surprisedby just how small the Chamber for Members of Parliament is, as the opposition andthose holding power by general election face each other during specific times.Like school they have terms, and when not in the Houses of Parliament they attendtheir local political functions and deal directly with members of the public, such asa Commoner, like me. After the tour we again had drinks prior to being seated inthe Members Dining Room which was a splendid room sited close to the RiverThames and adjoining balcony. An evening to remember as for the first time Ihad sat on a seat for both the Opposition and the Party in power, the Conservatives run by the Hon. David Cameron PM, PM. The Mp who had invited me and othersfor the Gala Dinner was Stephen Pound Mp to whom I and others of the day areeternally grateful for being able to attend such a wonderful venue. Maybe as a Commoner I will receive another invitation? Who knows?Geoffrey E. Dixon-Hamilton, editor@nordic-times.co.uk. (Sat. 11th. July, 2015). Sun. 6th.September, 2015. 11.13am gmt"

The guide gave lots of information and answered all the questions without any notes. You get the explanation of the Kings & Queens (esp Henry VIII) for overseas visitors but not too much. You see the House of Lords & the Commons but not Big Ben, which has a separate tour."

We had the English speaking Guided tour (i.e. with an actual person guiding us, rather than a go-at-your-own-pace machine) followed by a Cream Tea on the Terrace overlooking the River Thames. The Tour started on time. You have to go through airport security at the start (remove belts, walk through a scanner, etc). We then gathered in Westminster Hall. The Tour doesn't spend very long in Westminster Hall - but you *can* take photos there, which is not true of most of the rest of the tour. Allow yourself some time to complete doing the hall by yourself on the way back out. It was a hot day outside (getting on for 30 degrees) and the House of Parliament had varying degrees of air-con: the House of Commons was cool, the House of Lords was OK, but some places were a bit stuffy. There were some places to sit down, but you are NOT allowed to sit in the Commons or the Lords - supposedly in case we damaged the seating and because the Commons/Lords don't like it. Hmm. Not impressed: any damage could easily have been repaired for a lot less money than they make from the tours, and we are the people who Parliament is supposed to serve, so not letting us sit on their seats was a bit hoity toity of them.Our guide had a microphone and we had heaphones so that she could speak in a normal speaking tone and we could all hear her. However, her microphone wasn't working properly, so her voice kept dropping out, and at other times there were loud pops and crackles. It was easier for most of the time just to remove the headsets and listen to her natural speaking voice. I thought this was pretty poor.The guide was friendly and knowledgeable, talking about the history of the palace and of parliament. I know a fait bit about this topic already and didn't spot any errors. The tour in front of us was behind time, which made our guide rather agitated, and the tour ended 15 minute late. Overall the tour was thoroughly enjoyable and informative, but let down by the audio equipment.We then went on to our cream tea (booked in advance) which was eye wateringly expensive, BUT we loved it. The service was excellent: efficient but friendly. We were in a kind of marquee set up on the terrace of the House of Parliament overlooking the Thames. We had timed ticket and expected to be move on after about 45 minutes, but we were there for an hour and a half. The tent wasn't too hot, and we got refills of tea. Towards the end we got to move out of the tent and onto the terrace proper. We could take photos. The food was nice (if a bit noveau cuisine with the least messy Eton mess I have ever had - meringue, cream and fruit all in separate layers).Overall, for the tour and the tea: pricey but worth it, with some minor annoyances on our tour."

Don't think this tour is dry by any means. It was very interesting. We saw art and architecture as well as the two houses (Lords and Commons) and learned about the traditions and how the Queen fits into it all. Our son is 11 and he loved the tour too.

Absolutely stunning building which is steeped in history, it is a must see attraction when in London. There is a choice you can either have a guided tour, or an audio tour which you conduct yourself, the audio is in different languages, the information is informative, knowledgeable and the speed is just right, you will get a really good insight into what goes on in there. The security is tight and the building is being renovated in certain areas, you will see how magnificent this building is and the history it contains, The tour is available most weekdays during Parliamentary recesses it will take about 60-75mins. The interior is stunning and carefully preserved with a lot of lovely stunning art works and decorations. The 2 chambers: The House of Lords and House of Commons are fascinating to see, I definitely recommend this tour."

Tickets can be purchased online or in person (in advance, or on the day), from the Ticket Office located at the front of Portcullis House on Victoria Embankment- a 10 min walk from the Parliament entrance. Tours are available to visitors from the UK and overseas on Saturdays throughout the year, and on most weekdays during Parliamentary recesses. The tours are very popular in Summer. We were just lucky enough to get the last tickets at 2.30pm for the 4.30pm tour (last for the day) on a Sat in July. The tour takes about 60-75mins. The interior is beautiful with a lot of lovely art works and decorations. The 2 chambers: The House of Lords and House of Commons are fascinating to see-a bit smaller than I would have expected, and a lot of microphones hanging from the ceilings! The audio guide is very informative. No photos allowed. I highly recommend this tour."

Pick up your audio here and relax and enjoy the breathtaking tour. The tour will take you 1 and 1/2 hrs approx. Take your time and soak up the history. Kids loved it, they had the kids audio and loved the facts and questions!Enjoy the queens robing room, the royal gallery, the prince's chamber, the lord's chamber, central lobby, members lobby, voting lobby, commons chamber......spectacular!Its so unbelievable to think of all the historic icons that walked through these buildings.We didn't visit the coffee shop but we did pop into the gift shop , it wasn't very big, we bought a small fridge magnet as a souvenir of our visit. The toilets are very grand and clean.The entry and exit grounds are an amazing place for pictures with big ben and London eye in background!We had an amazing visit. Be prepared for renovations if you visit, there was work being done in various places in the building. This doesn't take away from the tour or the visit itself though.Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy......."

            "review": "A must-do. We've always wanted to go into the Houses of Parliament but it never occurred to us that we might be able to until last week. I believe UK citizens can arrange a free tour through their MP but we booked it last minute on the internet the night before our day trip to London - you can do a guided tour but we opted for the self-guided audio tour which cost \u00a318 each.If you book online you can either print your ticket at home or collect on the day. We don't have a printer so opted to collect at the ticket office - for info, when you get there there isn't really any signage that tells you where to go except a sign saying \"visitors entrance\". You just walk along with the Houses to your left until you come to a big barrier with police. We said we were collecting tickets and they let you into the other side of the barrier, tell you where to wait, then someone comes out, takes your details, and goes and gets your tickets for you. Once you have your tickets, you go through security, which is straightforward - bags through the scanner, you go through the metal detector, they give you a visitor pass, job done. You can take liquids through - they asked me to show them my aerosol (deodorant!) but I was allowed to keep it. For info, we were booked onto an audio tour at 11:40, we picked up our tickets around 11:10, we spent about 5-10 minutes at security, then we were in. That was a Saturday in August. You pick up your audio guide in the Westminster Hall and that's it, you're away. Photography is allowed in Westminster Hall & St Stephen's Hall but everywhere else it's strictly prohibited and you will get told off if you are caught but that's all - my husband got a ticking-off but he wasn't made to delete anything or show anyone his camera.Anyway, the tour: it takes you through from Westminster Hall, through to the Central Lobby, House of Lords, House of Commons, and back again. The whole building is absolutely gorgeous and the sense of history is overwhelming - the audio guide takes you through some of the things that have happened within those walls - not to mention that you are walking in places where world leaders and monarchs have trod and where they continue to tread today! The audio itself is very good, although I tended to drift off after a while. You hear from current and former members of parliament, and get a thorough history of the place. But you go at your own pace so you can listen to it as much as you like or as little. The only downside really is that being such an old building, it is constantly under repair. On our trip the tiles in the middle of the Central Lobby were being replaced so there was a mini scaffold in the middle of the floor. But you just have to get on with it. At the end of the tour, there is a cafe and gift shop. We didn't find anything interesting in the gift shop but had tea and cake in the cafe and found it reasonably-priced - pot of tea for one: \u00a31.95, huge slice of cake: \u00a33 or thereabouts. There is a good selection of cakes and, well, everything really. The cafe is clean and the crockery is from Stoke! Overall this was a brilliant trip and an absolute must-do whether you're a native or a visitor - we are British and for us it was incredible to be at the seat of power and also to be somewhere that has so much history but which is still very much an active hub in today's Britain.By the way, I believe you can get tickets on the day - we saw a policewoman directing someone and she was waving them over in the direction of Big Ben so I guess the ticket office might be over there?!"

This Hall is so impressive and massive, you start to realize how vast the British empire was at one time. I was surprised by how many rooms they allowed us to visit. House of Commons, House of Lords, Lords Chamber with the Queen's highly ornate gold throne, Central Lobby with beautiful mosaics representing England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. Definitely take time to listen to the explanation of each mosaic on the audio. It's fascinating. The audio tour also explains how traditions are handed down over the centuries and to this day the House of Commons slams the door in Black Rod's face and he must knock 3 times to enter. You then see the indentation in the huge wooden door from centuries of knocks. Isn't that great! If you love architecture and love history, this is a must see!"

Having passed through airport standard security (and rightly so) you proceed into Westminster Hall to collect your audio headphones and controls, and off you go! The Hall is the oldest building on the Parliamentary Estate and has evolved over 900 hundred years! Not only does it have an amazing roof, but it represents 900 years of constitutional British History. Anyway I am in danger of replicating the tour here so I suggest a visit to London and a guided tour around this amazing historical building! Highly recommended."

It seems that people do not realise that when Parliament is not in session (especially during the summer) it is possible to do a tour inside the Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament). I have lived in London for over 40 years and have been meaning to go for ages. Having seen both the Lords and Commons chambers on television I was expecting to be impressed but I was absolutely stunned by the architecture, heraldry, art and the sheer majesty of the place. I booked tickets the day before and it seems tickets can even be bought on the day. There was no queue to enter via the now obligatory airport style security even though it was the height of the tourist season. Do people not realise they can go round the inside of Parliament? We did the self-guided audio tour which is really well organised in a loop around the interior taking about 90 minutes. Obviously you can take longer (or less time) if you wish. The commentary was just right. There is a small shop and caf\u00e9. It is also possible to book afternoon tea on the river terrace but we gave that a miss \u2013 entry to the Houses of Parliament for a family of 5 (with concessions for age and student status) was \u00a380 and tea on top of that at \u00a327.50 a person would have meant a total bill of over \u00a3200 \u2013 we had wraps, sandwiches and drinks just down the road past Westminster Abbey for \u00a320 instead!!! All in all an absolutely brilliant couple of hours seeing where the UK is governed from. It made me understand even more what a sheltered and cloistered life many of our Members of Parliament lead."

I had little to no idea of what I was looking at and since the majority of my tour group was British, the tour guide did not spend the time to give us a civics lesson on how British politics work. Lots of comments like, \"I'm sure this looked bigger on TV\" or \"You're already aware of how this works...\" And here I am thinking, \"I've never seen this on TV\" and \"No, I am not.\" The tour guide was a little dry, but not terrible. Lots of walking and very few places to sit. I would compare it to touring Congress in the U.S., which is very interesting, unless you don't have any idea of how Congress works... If I had to go back, I probably wouldn't have sprung for the paid walking tour and would have spent my time elsewhere.

We had booked an English tour on-line which was very straight forward. The security check was quick and you wait in the impressive Westminster hall for the tour to start. Our guide was Owen and he was very informative and amusing. It's a shame that you are only allowed to take photos in Westminster Hall and St Stephen's Hall. The guide takes you to the end of the buildings and then you make your way through the robing room, Royal Gallery, Lord's chamber, Central Lobby, Member's lobby and Common's chamber learning all the history as you go. It's amazing to see the rooms that you normally just see on television and it does make you feel proud to be British. The tour takes almost 2 hours and is well worth the money. We would recommend doing the tour with a guide rather than the audio-tour. The caf\u00e9 had some nice food but the queue for the Ladies toilet was ridiculous. We would recommend doing the tour of the Houses of Parliament whether you are a tourist or British."

We were staying at the Westminster Plaza just over the bridge so didn't bring anything with us except for the pre printed tickets.The tour was led by a very knowledgable lady (I think her name was Vina) who kept us all fascinated for nearly 2 hours while we walked around the rooms we normally only see on the news. She included information about the history as well as how Parliament and the House of Lords operates in this day and age.We both found it fascinating, and would happily go again next time we visit London."

My little eight year old grandson and I have been to London together on several occasions and seen the exterior of the Palace of Westminster many times, but each time he has remarked how much he would like to see inside. I was sceptical, thinking that he would be bored out of his mind, but no, he wanted to go, despite my protestations! So we did.The online booking facility was not working on the day I made our reservation about six weeks back, so I actually spoke to a person on the other end of a reservations telephone service! She was very helpful indeed and guided me to the junior audio tour rather than a full guided tour as this gave some rather more humourous facts and anecdotes for younger minds. I opted for the adult audio tour and booked a souvenir book plus tea on the terrace for us both after the tour.The audio tour tape was of exceptionally good sound quality and gave some fascinating information at every stop along the way. My grandson and I would stop before moving on to the next numbered venue and compare notes (as our audio tapes were different) - he had picked up such large chunks of information and retained them - fantastic!I had never seen inside either Chamber (except on TV) and was stunned at the sheer beauty of the decor and the intimate nature of the place, as it's all much more compact than it appears. We were both fascinated at being able to see things at such close quarters and imagined which famous posteriors had been sat on each of the various seats and benches!When it came to tea, we were instructed to wait for the Sergeant at Arms to escort us to the Terrace, where we were duly shown to our very beautifully set table and became immediately aware of the stunning view directly across the Thames to the old GLC building, the Eye and St. Thomas's Hospital.The food offering was good, although not exceptional for the (not insubstantial) price! Frankly, they were a little mean with their portions, but a certain little lad thoroughly enjoyed every mouthful of the cakes and scones, so why worry!Ever since our visit, my small companion has talked of nothing else - so I figure it must have all been worth it!"

We are a family of four, our teens are 14 and 16, and my husband is British. Our guide was Joanne, and she was so knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. I highly recommend her. Even though the Victorian side of,the building is beautiful to look at, and our guide imparted wonderful details that you can't get from the audio guide, the truly interesting part of the tour is when you head over to the House of Commons. She did a brilliant job of making parliamentary procedure and politics come alive. My husband learned lots he didn't know before, and both my kids agreed that it was very interesting and worth doing. We did the last tour of the day, and I recommend that too. It meant that we had much of the place to ourselves and we weren't distracted by other tourists. It is best to get these tickets in advance. We bought ours the day before, and were lucky. But we also tried to get tickets back in late June and had no luck. This tour was by far the most interesting tour I have done in England, and I lived there for 20 years. Not to be missed.By the way, there is a lot of standing and listening, for 90 minutes. I would probably not recommend this tour for,those who can't stand for long, and I do not recommend this for kids under the age of 12, unless they happen to be very interested in government and politics."

The staff are invariably helpful; and I confess that taking tea and muffins (real ones, not what the Americans call \"English muffins\") is enjoyable and, like many parts of the edifice, in a place which offers plenty of opportunity for quiet conversation and small meetings.There are gift shops - and I understand that the passport covers.from the shop in the Lords, made to fit the passports issued before the EU standard document, go down very well at overseas border control points!It is years since I have been there as a tourist; but it is well worth a visit"

However our tour was booked for 15:00, but when we seen a tour queueing at 14:55 we asked whether it was the 15:00 tour just getting ready, but they said that it wasn't and that it was the 14:30 tour, so when we asked if they were running late they replied with \"no, you're just early\". But we were asked if we wanted to join that tour as there was room, so we did and I think it was actually a good choice as our tour guide (Brian/Bryan) was very funny and tried to make the tour more entertaining as we had a 10 year old and a 7 year old with us.The only problem on the actual tour was the seating; we understand that we can't sit in certain places, but there could be temporary seating in place for tours. The only other problem was that sometimes the tour behind us caught up with us or we caught up with the tour in front of us and our groups would get mixed up and we would end up briefly losing the rest of our group."

After a boat ride on the Thymes, we ended up with a few hours of touring time left and saw a sign for Houses of Parliament Tours. We were fortunate and bought two guided tickets for the last tour of the day. We walked a little way to the entry and after a security check entered and waited for our tour. **TIP** Tours last about 45 minutes but the last tour of the day can run longer if the guide and tour click. You might get a much more in depth tour than \"normal\".The tour was amazing. Unfortunately you can't take pictures, but you get to see everything. As we were walking down a long hall, Big Ben tolled the top of the hour and it ran a few chills down my spine thinking about where I was and what I was hearing. This was truly the \"unexpected surprise\" of our visit to London, and even if you are not that interested in the British Government, the rooms are quite impressive."

Plenty to see inside, and some fascinating information as to the establishment of Parliament and how it has fared over the past several hundred years. The air of tradition from the paintings and sculptures, through to the doorkeepers and their traditional outfits is great. Finally, always remember that this is a working building, even when Parliament is not sitting there is still plenty going on so you may be instructed to behave by the officials on duty!"

It is a wonderful place as the Mother of Parliaments for anyone to visit. You need to get your organising precisely right to get into the building at the right time, so go through the right channels, and the security is very tough these days. But it is all worth it to see where so many truly historic moments of our history have happened. At the right time you can visit the Chambers of the Commons and the Lords, and also see the lobbies just outside where the Members meet and discuss what they will do in the various votes. You can see the bronze statue of Winston Churchill outside the Commons chamber with one shoe polished bright from Members touching it for good luck before making a speech in the Chamber. The whole of both Houses are full of tradition and wonderful architecture and historic paintings and pictures. See the Royal Gallery in the Lords through which the monarch processes to open Parliament. And make sure you do not miss the most historic part of all, Westminster Hall, which has stood there for 1000 years since Norman kings built it, and it has witnessed great trials.speeches, and laying in state of deceased monarchs down the ages. All together a truly magical place of history not to be missed"

We pre-booked tickets online at the visit.parliament.uk website and were very glad we did as we got the 9:20 am tour but folks showing up at that time without tickets were getting 3:30 entry times. The site is amazing. The amount of history, changes, architecture etc. is amazing. The tour is well done with lots of extra options on various topics if you want to learn more. Without extras the audio tour takes about 1 hour 15 minutes. The architecture and gilding in the House of Lords is stunning. And it is so fun to walk down the \"No\" division hallway or along the way the Queen walks as she dresses in her royal garb to open Parliament each year. We thought it was an excellent tour.Notes: Book in advance especially during the summer. This is a VERY busy tourist site and often closed so be sure to check in advance if you haven't pre-booked tickets. For example it was only open for tours on Saturdays in the month of July 2015. For the audio tour adults are \u00a318 (US $27), students are \u00a315.50 (US $23), one child (ages 5-15) free with each paid adult but above that children are \u00a37.20 (US $11). Unless the child has a big attention span, it may be too much for them. There are pictures allowed in couple of areas but in most of the Parliament pictures are not allowed for security reasons."

They display history pieces of well known revolutionaries and activists (E.G. The todpuddle martyrs) that I actually find quite patronizing. It basically implies that laws and rights were given to the people by parliament. That is false. Rights and laws were fought by ordinary people who died, were imprisoned and injured for their efforts. Once you pass the patronizing statements, the actual building itself isn't at all that interesting. You pretty much get a 2 hour tour of explanations about the architecture of the building (while builders are trying to fix parts of it all around you). If the tour was cheaper and less exclusive, then it would be more reasonable to argue that the tour is worth it. If you can get it for free, it's worth the one visit just for experience."

The other good thing is that you listen to what you want, not stuck with endless audio, you can listen to what ever extras you want. They're understandably sensitive about where you go, and although pictures are not allowed, they seem to turn a blind eye, as long as your not too obvious. The architecture, history that you can see and feel around you, make it an unmissable tour. I would recommend to any visitor to London."

Firstly wear a comfy pair of shoes your going to do a lot of walking and if you use a walking stick do bring it because you will be doing a lot of standing and not much sitting. Do book online it is so much easier but you can write to your MP and try to get a freebie.We had a brilliant afternoon being shown around this very beautiful building. it is so steeped in British history that as I enter the Main Lobby which has a history of over a thousand years and I stood where Thomas Moor and Will Wallace had stood for their trials a thrill went through my body and I was well and truly hooked from that moment on. You will experience 'airport security' but everyone from the Greeters at the gates to the Police and security staff are so welcoming and efficient that that all passes in the twinkling of an eye. The toilets and shop are to your right on entering the Main Lobby but do take time to look and marvel at the original vaulted roof the minor repairs because of Death Watch Beetle are undetectable and then down to look at the bronze plaques - see if you get that thrill as I did. Present your booking form at the desk and you will be asked to join a group no more than 25 - handed an earphone set ( so you can hear your guide clearly) be warned there is static initially but as you progress on it lessens , although my husband said he could hear perfectly well without them. Our tour guide Derek was simply the best we have ever had in and outside the UK . He had humour , diplomacy and was very, very knowledgeable . I genuinely think he reached all levels of interest from those like me who are nuts about history to those who have a passing interest. He clearly enjoyed his worked and his one aim was to help us appreciate this wonderful experience in its many forms.it is an outstanding building , beautifully preserved , a real jewel in our crown and is well worth seeing just for the architecture alone. I'm not going to spoil it for you by detailing 'stuff' but its nice to see where the wheels of politics which governs our lives takes place. You can only take photos in the Main Lobby and in St Stephens Room so it is up to you but they are really strict about no photos anywhere else - You have been warned!!This tour in my humble opinion isn't for tiny children there is no hands on experiences and even as adults we were expected to behave !! You will be made aware where and when you can take a quick rest and strictly no chewing gum but you can take a bottle of water with you - however there is a caf\u00e9 outside or if you really want to push the boat out book an afternoon tea and continue to enjoy your experience . Book at same time as booking your tour.We did this, and as we had about 15minutes to kill before our slot became available it was an opportune moment for a toilet break and quick nose around the tiny shop ( some nice bits and pieces ) - once back in the main Lobby just ask a member of staff who will directed you where to go either the Terrace or as it wasn't available on the day we went the Members Dining Room which suited me a treat as after watching House of Cards I could imagine all those Machiavellian plots taking place over Shepherds Pie and a nice red. Once again you will be guided to the Restaurant from your waiting area , all done with a lovely smile and you will be made to feel very welcome. Our waiters and waitresses ( we had two or was it three ) went out of their way to make our experience as perfect as possible . The food was fresh and extremely delicious - a very inventive selection of cakes and savouries including a Salmon and Lemon Curd Roll ! but it worked perfectly and the delightfully tiny chocolate tart was manna from heaven. A variety of teas were available as well as coffee but the coffee doesn't appear on the menu so be prepared to ask . Do have a glass of champagne it's very moreish and befits the moment (\u00a350.00 a bottle or \u00a39.00 a glass) be warned they don't take cards but I think they must have a cash machine there as someone was taken off - for beheading !! no just to get some cash . All in all an absolutely first class experience, but don't even think of snaffling a memento such as the menu as they do come and remove them towards the end of your tea experience - do as I did and take a photo - trust me you will never remember the designer savoury and sweet names after leaving. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did. Downside only the state of the toilets surprisingly lots of used toilet paper covering the floor and receptacle but I think this was caused by confusion from visitors not understanding that toilet paper can be flushed away - having been to remoter parts of Europe where it is frowned on to flush anything other than the usual away. It was embarrassing to see a foreign visitor look at the Check List Chart for cleaning and shake her head. Apart from this one small point it was a fabulous Afternoon out."

I would say that small children would be bored out of their loverly little minds!! This is my second visit.We were on a day trip to London with a 14 year old nephew and this was one of the attractions we had planned for the day. We grinningly wanted to go up the Queen Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben), but for this you need to be sponsored by your local MP and you must also be a British citizen. Every MP gets a limited number of tickets for Big Ben and most will put your name in a lottery. I guess every MP will do things differently, but this is certainly how our MP does it (Alistair Burt - Bedfordshire). Firstly, the entrance price is reasonable for London and one child goes free with one adult. There is an airport style security check when entering (opposite Westminster Abbey) but you should expect that (why am I always subjected to a pat down?!). Once through, you make your way to Westminster Great Hall. There you show your tickets and either meet your tour group or pick up your audio guides. On my first visit we had a tour guide and she was informative and you could ask additional questions. But it was a bit of a conveyor belt experience. This time we went for the audio guides and I thought they were excellent. Very clear and they were able to bring in current members of parliarment and they also gave sounds of the working building. The position points (about 20 from memory) were clearly indicated and the route was easy to follow. Once the audio piece had finished for a particular point, you had the option of keying in additional codes to get extra filler info which added depth to the experience - this was excellent and appreciated. One perk of joining the guided tour is that they get to go in through the government side of the commons and they could therefore stand at the dispatch box where the PM stands. The audio tour had to be content with being part of Her Majesty's opposition! This was the only thing that really irritated me as this was (for me) the main part of the tour. I have to admit I waited for the security person to get involved with someone else and then I stepped over the roped barrier and stood where I wanted to go! I don't recommend this and I was asked politely to go back, but I got the experience I had paid my money for. This needs to be changed as I really don't think it is fair to offer this only to the tour guide parties. If we can't challenge unfairness in the House of Commons, then where can we?! :o) I also has a sneaky quick sit down on the benches although this is not allowed - my taxes pay for them and I'm as honourable as those who do sit there (or perhaps more so in some cases!)... I really enjoyed this tour and would recommend to others. It is worth mentioning that you have the right to go to the visitors gallery in the Lords and Commons for FREE when the house is sitting and your MP will often give you a free tour too if you ask. Our tour started at 11:20 and we were out by 1pm. If you are out on a bit of a budget, there is a TESCO Express (or compress - the narrowest Tesco in the UK!) opposite Big Ben side of Parliament. You can buy sandwiches etc there and then cross Westminster Bridge and exit at the London Eye. You then cross under the bridge and walk alone the Embankment. Just a bit along there are park benches with great views of Parliament. You can eat your family lunch there. After watching Mission Impossible today, there is a scene shot on the very bench where we sat yesterday!! Spooky!Enjoy your visit..."

The staff were not very friendly, and came accross as rude and slightly scornful. In the house of commons chamber, there was one particular tour guide who was with a group and me and my Mum were accidentally stood near the benches on the government side. There is no clear signs or notices telling you to not stand in certain areas. The guide turned to a security guide and said \" please will you move these people out of the way immediatley\" and gave us a threatening look. We complied with this command and carried on feeling targeted and angry. Also there are not many places you can see, and photography is not allowed. We understand this is for security reasns, but added to our disapointment. The history of the building is interesting and unique. The audio toir is good and the upkeep of the building is good too. It was fascinating to see familiar sights in person and was worth the price.However I left the Parliament dissapointed by the lack of respect from staff of all kinds in the parliament and also dissapointed as you cannot see a lot of the building. All in all I enjoyed some aspects of the visit, but would only go back if I were to be elected as an MP or appointed a Lord. I feel that there is too many rules to follow and that the staff, wether they are tour guides or security guards lack respect and training."

I was particularly moved to be freely walking around the front and back benches in the Commons. I am not usually prone to mawkish sentiment, but seeing this place did stir a sense of pride and gratitude for our democracy.The audio guide is marvellous (and an additional benefit is that you are insulated from the cacophony), criticism, if any, is that I wanted more.I am sure that I will return."

Our MP's very kind PA got us on one of the guided tours as I realised at the last minute that as parliament was still sitting you couldn't get in during the week other than on these tours which are apparently booked up months in advance (thank you Elaine Wylie). You just drop your MP an email and they took it from there & got us slots on a cancellation. We didn't pay anything by having our MP sponsor us for the visit, not sure if this is the norm.The tour itself was extremely interesting. Our guide was one of the doorkeepers who was very knowledgable and amusing to boot & we had a good banter re the current SNP situation at the Houses of Parliament, which of course went over the other tourists heads as they were all non UK.I learnt lots of interesting facts & the buildings themselves are just beautiful. Be prepared for a bit of walking. We had our teenage kids with us who loved it, but I think under 10s would be bored. You don't get to sit down at all - execution was threatened if we sat on any of the MPs seats, haha! One foreigner of course sat down.....off with her head!"

Mobile phones must be switched off and no photography is allowed once the tour starts.It's incredibly interesting and even without a knowledge of English history it would be enjoyable. Our group were lucky enough to enter both the House of Lords and the House of Commons. You are not allowed to sit in either of the Houses although we did get to stand to get an idea of how it feels.The tour lasts around and hour and fifteen minutes but it is all walking and standing so not for the less able.A thoroughly enjoyable and educational visit."

My only criticism is that photography is not allowed in most areas which is for both security (but why when the place is so well documented and streams live TV broadcasts) and because they want to preserve photography for commercial reasons - this is publicly funded building - why can't amateurs take photos?"

The next room is St. Stephens Hall and the last room where we were allowed to take photos. This room has statues to famous statesmen. I was a bit jet lagged so I didn't get all the details that we heard about each of the rooms and the parliamentary process that seemed to be complicated. There is a central lobby between the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Both the houses have fewer seats than members so many stand. The House of Lords has an ornate red and gold throne for the monarch. The monarchy is not allowed in the House of Commons due to an incident that occurred with King Charles I in the 1600's."

Since Parliament was in session this month you could only visit on the weekend. The tour gives access to a couple of places you can't go on the self-guided tour, and it was probably worth the extra cost. The building itself is gorgeous, especially the House of Lords. Due to weekend construction our Underground stop was closed so we had to scramble for transport and consequently missed our scheduled tour. The staff were very kind and moved us to the next tour, which was only a half hour later (10 am I think). The crowds were not extensive at that time. You can only take pictures where the tour starts, in Westminster Hall. The exterior is very beautiful though, so do bring some kind of camera."

Upon entry you get close up views of Big Ben from inside the grounds of parliament, away from the hustle of the street crowds.

Everytime I have to go to Parliement for a meeting I consider it a great privilege for where else can one simply bump into senior politicians and political commentators simply going about their day to day jobs in such apparent opulence. Of course the reality is different from the initial veneer, and if one allows ones eyes to truly scrutinize things, it is apparent why this amazing building which was completed a little under 150 years ago is in desperate need of more than a paint job.For all this, this is a must for any visitor to London, although to be fair I have no idea how one the queues take, and especially when Parliament is in session."

The history speaks for itself but one is struck by how small both houses are, not as you see on TV. The guides are both informative and entertaining. Whilst the Greeks may well be responsible for our democratic system, our parliament stands as the oldest democracy in the modern world. Watching the sometimes buffoonery behaviour of members during PMQs one might wonder about the maturity of some members. An absolute must see."

This was our first real tourist trip to the capital, despite visiting friends in London before, and we had a lot of things that we really wanted to pack in to our 2 day trip. We organised the tour of parliament through our MP (which costs nothing if you are a resident of the UK. You email your MP in advance and it can be arranged in advance). This was the first place we visited in London and it didn't get any better. We entered through the tourist gates with our pass, waited in Westminster Hall for the tour guide, and were then shown round the Houses over a 2 hour period. The tour guide was excellent, very well informed, and answered every question put to him by the group. The tour started in Westminster Hall, passed through the Royal entrance where the Queen arrives to open Parliament, on to the House of Lords with its magnificent royal throne, then on to the House of Commons, where the first Prime Minister's Question session of the new parliament was due to take place (we seen quite a few MPs jostling for seats before the session began, which only added to the tour).Overall I couldn't recommend this tour enough. The whole building is truly spectacular, and often whilst inside I had the feeling that the building was almost too grand to be a place of work. Whatever you think of the people who work inside it, the tour is well worth a visit. For the architecture, splendour, artwork and history, it really is breathtaking. A 10/10 from me"

We were given the tip to ask for access to the public gallery of the House of Lords - the queues for that chamber are apparently always much smaller. However, once you are inside the Houses of Parliament, you can then move to the Commons easily.You will, of course, need to pass through security checks but it is well worth the hassle.

Definitely research this before your trip...tours are only available during most of the year on Saturdays unless you are from the UK in which case I believe there is a way to arrange for weekday tours. (Tours of Big Ben are only available for UK residents.) The only time you can tour throughout the week is when Parliament is on a recess. Both visitors from the UK and oversees are able to watch both the House of Lords and House of Commons in action while they are in session. We were able to watch the House of Lords on their last day of the session and then come back for the full tour the next day. When you watch one of the Houses from the viewing gallery, you are able to enter the building and see many parts of it, but it is not at all the same as going on the tour. Both my 13 year old daughter and I enjoyed both visits (watching a session and also the tour). If I were going again, I would definitely schedule time to do both if Parliament was in session during the trip. My 13 year old found this very interesting when she studied American History and how our (the US) government was put together/established and why. It gave her an interesting perspective. I was also very impressed with the way she compared both governments (US and UK) after her 8th grade trip to Washington DC. I'm not sure an elementary school age child would find it as interesting, but I would highly recommend visiting Parliament for teens and adults. It was a highlight of our trip. I have to say the beauty alone of the building makes it worth visiting. I know this may sound silly, but on our first day out in London...when the building first came into view...I'm embarrassed to say my heart jumped in my chest. It was THAT beautiful. Don't miss seeing it!"

After having grown up in the London area, visiting the Houses of Parliament was something I've always wanted to do but only now, visitng London with my family from America, did I get an opportunity...and it was great! It was really something to stand at the exact spot in the House of Commons as does the Prime Minister and the grand spectacle of Westminister hall was amazing. The audio tour is excellent as it points out various obvious, and less obvious points of interest (like the mark on the wooden door that \"Black Rod' has made over hte years as he knocks to request entry for the monarch). The only small disappointment is the limitation on taking photographs, restricted to just two areas. This seems to be a growing and unwelcomed trend among the major sights in London."

The personal tour is too long, only available to US citizens on Saturdays, not interesting enough, and you can't go at your own pace (obviously). Also, it costs too much, is not worth it, and lasts 1.5 hrs. I found the guides were informational but boring. If you do a tour, print your tickets at home or else you have to stand in an additional line. Parliament itself is full of history to learn about and beautiful artwork and architecture so I definitely recommend going but think twice about a guided tour! Heads up that U.S. Citizens cannot tour the Elizabeth Tower."

Whilst the whole trip was wonderful, the biggest revelation for me was the Westminster Hall. I had not realised that there was a part of the Houses of Parliament that was so old. It dates from 1099 and was actually originally part of the Palace of Westminster, used by the kings and queens of England until the Tudors, when Hampton Court became the major royal place. I actually became quite overcome by the history of this hall when looking at the plaques on the floor commemorating momentous moments in history. A must see, as is a visit to the whole of the houses of parliament. The Victorian gothic part of the building was jaw dropping including the architecture, the decoration, the gold, the tradition, and the paintings Our guide was so informative and I learnt so much about the history of politics and parliament in Great Britain. Also as part of the package we had afternoon tea near the house of commons in a building beside the river. The food was delicious and the service excellent, attentive and courteous, but not over stuffy or over the top. I would definitely recommend a visit to the houses of parliament. You will learn and see so much."

I purchased the tickets as a birthday gift for my mother, who has always wanted to visit. The tour itself is outstanding - I had opted for an audio tour, rather than a guide, as it would mean we could walk the route at our own pace and only move on when ready to do so. I would very highly recommend it. I had, however, also booked afternoon tea as an add-on. What an incredible disappointment that was. We arrived at the appointed place about ten minutes before our booked time (3.45pm) and took a seat, as requested. We were then informed that they were 'just setting up' and would be with us shortly. In reality, they had a huge group of 51, all also taking tea at 3.45pm. This group were prioritised ahead of us individual bookers - they arrived after us but were taken down to the tea room first and given all the window seats (overlooking the terrace)available. We had to wait a good fifteen minutes before being escorted down and (finally) seated. The HoP staff seemed to be incredibly arrogant in their attitude to us, the leader of the huge group constantly walked up and down the room to ensure her 'guests' were comfortable, which was very intrusive, and the whole experience was most unpleasant. The tea, when it arrived, was absolutely tiny - three little sandwiches each, one scone apiece and two tiny dessert type items. I understand that you pay an inflated price for the surroundings, but there was no offer of more of anything, even tea!! I also understand that groups are an important source of revenue, but to be treated so obviously as 'second class' and to have to put up with an over-bumptious tour group leader, who took over the room, was awful. Why not insist that such large groups book the entire tea sitting so individual guests aren't treated so shabbily? We did not leave a tip. I would absolutely dissuade anyone from booking this! Take tea at Fortnums of Harrods instead!"

The paintings and history of the place makes this a must see place to go. The only thing I found disappointing is after the tour (which lasts about 90 mins ) you are not able to look round again on your own.We were not told this and started to walk back into the main building again just to look into some of the rooms. As we were not wearing the audio headwear we stood out and got ask by security for a look at our tickets, we told them we had been on the tour and we were told we could not look round on our own and we must go back to the main hall.After a brilliant tour, I left feeling disappointed. Some of the rooms and paintings were really interesting and full of history and we just wanted to have a proper look at them.If you do the audio tour, you can walk round at your own pace and can easily stay for more then two hours.Just bear this in mind when booking as it does cost \u00a325 for the tour and the audio is cheaper."

I loved seeing the House of Lords and the House of Commons and learning about the way the meetings are broadcast to the public."

It's so brilliant with paintings & carvings & statues. Every room in the Lords is chok full up. You get to go into each of the Lords & the Commons debating Chambers but you cannot sit down in those. But you can sit elsewhere in designated seats when the guide says so. We did the guided tour. Our guide was fabulous & she saved a seat for me on a sitting portion as I have a stick. It's a 90 min tour with 3 possible sits. Super interesting & the only stairs are at the beginning & end from Westminster Hall. It's a full airline security check to get inside."

Take the tour if you're from a place like the United States that does not have a parliamentary structure. It's a very interesting government scheme they have going on there but it seems to be working for them. We saw the houses of parliament on a private tour as part of a private event but WOW. I really enjoyed the tour. And the architecture, like much of it in London, is amazing."

The building itself is a fantastic sight to see and to experience the House of Commons (even though you are NOT allowed to sit down on any of the seats) even if you are not interested in politics is well worth the visit. We find it has also made watching the news more enjoyable as you are able to picture where it is they are referring to and recognise where they are reporting from.

We went on a Saturday morning, the security process was quick, efficient and friendly.Once in the Palace, we claimed our audio guides and set forth to explore. The audio guide was clear, succinct and very understandable. There are some restrictions on where you can and can't take photos.The tour takes you around the building in a logical way and you get to see things such as the Queen's robing room, walk through the Lords and the Commons chambers and some fascinating art work and statues.Having watched the BBC's documentary on Parliment in 2014, this made it an even more fascinating experience. Allow a good couple of hours for your visit."

The Great Hall is absolutely steeped in history, gave me goose pimples to be standing where Charles the First was indited and later sentenced to death.Food was not great and some of the wine awful.

She asked us which house we wanted to visit, to which we replied the House of Commons. We were given a green ticket and were led inside, where after a security check. we entered a room above the House of Commons, with a glass partition through which the whole house was visible. There were LCD screens and speakers all around, through which we could see and hear the MP's as well. We could see the whole House, and heard the MP's debating. You can sit there for as long as you want; we sat for 1 hour. Across the House of Parliament is the Supreme Court, which is also free to visit. Both of these gave a great outlook in the Political and Judicial system of UK, and were my favorite part of my recent trip to London. I would highly recommend visiting The House Of Parliament."

Such is life!That said, there is so much to absorb; the inexpensive tea-rooms and well-stocked souvenir shops, provide a welcome respite from the somewhat \"Magical Mystery Tour\" of Britain's history, dating back to the 17th century and beyond.Everything from priceless Art & Treasures to an authentic hand-written letter from Guy Fawkes, are in full view to the public, including life-size bronze statues of historic Prime Ministers and monarchs.  Access to both the House of Commons, where monumental decisions have altered the course of history were made, and the House of Lords, \"The Upper House\", provide anyone, with even the remotest interest in politics, art, history and religion, with an invaluable insight and unforgettable experience.Having been FOUR times, I admit to having only \"scratched the surface\" of this unique Palace of Westminster.An \"Absolute Must\" for any tourist...whatever nationality.Personally, as a Brit, I would put such a visit on the National High School Curriculum!I cannot recommend it highly enough."

My MP Is Jim Fitzpatrick, and although we were only in the HoP for about 80-90 mins, we covered a huge amount of ground, both physically, historically and anecdotally. I was hugely impressed and loved every moment.I can't vouch for the quality of the general tour guides, but the collective buildings are stunning and speak for themselves. It's a shame no photos are allowed inside, but understandable.Highly recommended."

Security's tight, but not overly intrusive, just make sure you allow plenty of time to go through the procedures. Then marvel at the architecture, the sense of history and political purpose, and even do a bit of discrete celebrity spotting - from MPs to petitioners and even the occasional famous personality. The guided tours are well organised and the guides are well informed and passionate about their jobs. If you can, book afternoon tea. What could be better than a cuppa in the seat of democracy, followed by a comfort break in the most democratic of public conveniences!"

It was fascinating to see all the Victorian Bible verse references inbuilt in Commons floor tiles and wall panelling, it's a pity the incumbents don't appear to much adhere to the words of Holy advice surrounding them. We found the House of Lords to be too heavily-gilt, and subsequently it's a vulgarly overly-opulent gaff.

However there weren't that many people visiting first thing in the morning so we could probably have just bought tickets on the day. It did seem much busier later on.We went through some airport style security checks and then picked up our audio guides and a map of the tour. When I first got the map it didn't seem very impressive but there is so much to see even in the relatively few rooms you get to visit. Plus the scale and grandeur of the rooms is impressive in a couple of cases.Some of the rooms are shown on tv on the news or political programmes but you can not beat seeing them in person - they are so ornate (apart from the House of Commons) and seeped in history.I'm really glad I went to see the Houses of Parliament - well worth the price of the admission - beautiful and awe inspiring."

So get there early. Security is pretty quick. You have full access to both Houses and the audio tour is very informative. Spoke at length to a docent at the House of Commons.

The tour included both the MP's chamber and of course the Lords Chamber.

Wonderful ! The great thing about this place is the sense of history and the insight into the day to day business of being a member of Parliament or a Lord. There is nowhere else you can go to savour the atmosphere of this unique building and I would really recommend to anyone that they visit the Houses of Parliament should they get the opportunity.

It's some time since I visited Parliament (with a friend); I had tried once before, but there was a huge queue that time and I cried off. This time, there were fewer visitors being let in by the policemen on duty in the street outside. Up several flights of stairs, to what reminded me of the stage-door office of a theatre. There there was a security-check (phew! We passed!), more stairs and suddenly, slightly vertiginously, we were in the Visitors' Gallery high above the House of Commons. There had been a slightly faded, tatty air about the staircases; the rows of benches in the gallery were comparably spartan; but it seemed strange to be watching from the side opposite the Speaker's chair, and above, a debate such as one had previously often witnessed from one of two fixed viewpoints facing the rows of MPs, on television. On this occasion (mid-afternoon, I think?), the Chamber was sparsely occupied - maybe a dozen MPs, and a somnolent atmosphere. The debate, too, was on a not totally-engrossing topic, dry, factual, desultory; a bit disappointing. So after a decent period, we quietly made our way out and downstairs to the entrance-lobby. Much livelier and more interesting, with all manner of folk coming and going the entire time, and the decorative architecture very striking and ceremonial: THIS was how Parliament should be! The opportunity was offered at this point for us to visit the House of Lords. We were tempted; but the experience at the Commons had put us off, so instead we made our way round to the HIGHLIGHT of our visit: Westminster Hall. A HUGE open space with venerable stone-slab flooring, and, as I understand it, the oldest part of the Houses of Parliament, where the original King's Councils took place, it was easy to imagine this vast, grey-floored, high-walled, stained-glass-windowed SPACE, topped by dark wooden carved angels peering in from the eaves, as a location where, filled with robed nobles, great decisions were made. Almost empty, but for a modest stage-like stairs at the far end, and an exhibition of very useful pamphlets along one wall, it stirred the theatre in one's soul. You could have raced around it on roller-skates (and probably got sent to the Tower) or launched into a speech from Henry V: such a venue was it....! In the event, we peered at the very-interesting and -informative pamphlets. selecting the most-interesting to take home, and left by the side-door at the far end, feeling thoroughly part of History. (In fact, our visit was earlier than August 2014, but (a) no facility for giving this information (b) not sure exactly when, anyway....."

Parliament exists to challenge the work of government, approve new laws and debate government policy and current issues.Westminster Hall is a striking building and is officially a royal palace. Standing on the banks of the river Thames the Parliamentary buildings hold many important historical stories, most famously Guy Fawkes.UK residents can attend debates, watch committees, take a tour of Parliament and climb the Clock TowerOverseas visitors can attend debates and watch committees when Parliament is in session, and can tour Parliament every Saturday and during the Summer OpeningThere are tours available on a regular basis - they include access to some of the most important areas of the Palace in which Parliament meets, and explains what Parliament is and does, what it has meant to different people at different times, and how it came to be what it is today.Most of the buildings seen on the tour were built in the mid 19th Century following a devastating fire, but the route also incorporates some of the earlier buildings, such as Westminster Hall, begun in 1097 by William Rufus, son of William the Conqueror.You cannot miss BIG BEN the clock tower which has an imposing look and a chime that rang out on radio during WW2. The Shop is also has a great range of interesting stuff.

You actually step onto the floor of the Lords and the Commons - inspiring stuff. You need to book ahead and there is a fairly tight security regime in place so allow plenty of time. Also, you will need to check ahead on available dates. Days when the Parliament is sitting are not available. Sadly there are no photos allowed but that is probably a great opportunity to just enjoy the fabulous surrounds. The only suggestion is that the tour can do with some proper audio devices for visitors. The non-amplified commentary can be very hard to hear at times due to the echo effect in the various parts of the tour and of course the noise from other tour groups"

We decided to get tickets to tour Parliament at the last minute and were SO glad we did- and that we could still get tickets! The tour was really interesting and may have been our favorite thing all week. The tour was extremely interesting and we learned so much. We loved learning about the history of Parliament but really liked how they tied the tour into current events. It was relatively easy since elections were coming up so the guide could talk about all that was getting ready to happen, but I think it would be fascinating any time.What I didn't expect was all the art and beautiful paintings, sculptures, etc. It is obviously not on the same scale as a museum, but just as beautiful.I would strongly recommend anyone visiting London definitely take the tour of Parliament."

Arrived well early (1130 for a 1220 tour) to allow for security queues. Told to come back at 1210. No problem - bought a reasonably priced coffee from outlet near entrance to Westminster Abbey across the road.Came back at noon and told to join queue.Airport style security - as expected - but friendly and efficient process.Let into Westminster Hall and directed to where my tour leader was waiting.Our group was meant to be 26 but left on time with a few missing.Glad I opted for guided tour rather than headphone self-guided tour,Had professional blue badge guide called Robina - who really knew her stuff!Slightly bemused that we seemed to join the wedding procession of a bride getting married in such prestigious surroundings!Knew that we'd get to see House of Commons and Lords on this tour. Oh Wow - I thought it would be a case being taken up to rope barrier and told to have a look and then move on.Oh No! You get to visit both iconic chambers. No photos - no sitting on the seats!Initially baulked at \u00a325 cost. Hmm - one of the best tours I have ever done - especially if you get a guide as good as I did!Bought an official guidebook in the shop - very reasonable I thought for \u00a35 I thought. Contains the photos that I wasn't allowed to take for myself! Very friendly girl on the till too.Didn't use the cafe as I was in a rush but prices looked very reasonable.In summary was an amazing visit on an historic weekend - new government just elected and tickets for concert for 70th anniversary of VE day to go to later. Being a tourist in central London doesn't get better than this!"

The House's of Parliament otherwise known as the Palace of Westminster are well worth visiting, such a sense of history (Shame about the twits that work there), joking aside, there is so much history attached to this building, the original building was built by William 11 between 1097 and 1099, it was the largest hall in England at that time.  The Building that sits on the banks of the River Thames is the new Palace, built between 1840 and 1870, within its walls (or Westminster Hall) is all that remains of the medieval old Palace, so many Historical events are linked to these buildings, just one well known event to mention is the Gunpowder Plot, where Guy Fawkes and his Conspirators planed to blow up the Houses of Parliament, he was tried and executed in 1606, the event is remembered every year in Great Britain on November the 5th, and fireworks are let off and models of Guy Fawkes are burned on bonfires. Charles 1, while still King, was tried and condemned as a tyrant, traitor and murderer there in 1649-even though no court had any legal authority over him. The Law Courts only moved out of the House's of Parliament in the 1800's.  Long unfit for purpose, the chance came to create a new palace, when in 1834, a fire destroyed most of the old structure. Sir Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin worked to create todays Perpendicular Gothic Building, containing 1,000 rooms and two courtyards, it covers 8 acres with an impressive 266m river coverage. Standing proud of the main building is the clock tower, home of the bell, affectionately known as Big Ben, quite sadly neither Barry or Pugin lived to see the New Building Completed"

We were greeted by our guide, Barbara, who explained the rules for the tour, one being no photography past the hall, which was disappointing. The tour took 2 hours and Barbara explained the history of the buildings, development of the Westminster parliamentary system, the daily operations of the parliament and other staff working there. She told us about various works of art and restoration of same. We were taken into the Houses of Lords and Common. She was well informed about all aspects of the complex and its operations and obviously very proud and passionate of her role as a guide. At the finish of our tour we visited the cafe for tea & scones looking out to Big Ben. We purchased a copy of the guide book as a momento of this delightful and educational experience.

We took the audio rather than the guided tour as there is a child's version which turned out to be perfect for our 10 year old, it also meant that we could explore at our own pace rather than that of one of the guides. Having said that I would like to visit again and do the guided tour as the snippets we heard as we were walking round did seem to be very interesting offering a little more than is possible with the audio tour.Being inside the building that we've seen so much on television and learning some of the detail, history, traditions and workings of both the building and parliament itself was fascinating.I'd thoroughly recommend a visit."

After getting thorough security (airport type, 30 mins) we had afternoon tea on the balcony overlooking the Thames. Fortunately it was a sunny day so we able to stand outside, admire the scenery and take pictures. The tea itself was quite good - decent sandwiches & cakes and selection of teas. Doesn't quite match some of the bigger hotels but still very good quality. We then joined our tour which was a small group (15 people) led by a great guide called Rob who provided lots of interesting background, history and anecdotes. Got to see all the main rooms and sights. Visitors do have the option of an audio guide but i would recommend the guided tour because you get a much better feel of the history and characters. If you are in London then this is a must do."

Nigel our guide had so much knowledge about the whole building it was interesting and fascinating and just wanted to know more. We also got to go into the areas where people with the headsets did not go so you get to see more. I think the whole visit has been made even more special due to the election coming up so Nigel related all of the areas to what is going to happen. I know that it's sad, but I'm now looking forward to watching the opening of Parliament with the Queen getting involved! Great stuff and well worth the visit."

England is full of rich history and tradition and a visit to the Parliament will give you a wonderful sense of all of this.I strongly urge you to sign up for a guided tour--not the audio guide, but an actual person. The building, inside and out is magnificent and with a guide you hear all of the history of the government, the traditions that have been in place for hundreds of years. You actually get to be in the House of Commons room, see the House of Lords, hear what happens when the queen comes to parliament . You are standing in history and it is amazing-- not enough words to describe it. Having a guide gives you a chance to hear some marvelous stories, get info that is not on the audio guide and to ask questions. This tour was one of the best things we did in London . You can sign up on line, which will save you time in case lines are long. Guided tours are offered many times throughout the day. DON'T MISS THIS"

The self-guided tour is very good and doesn't overload you with information. There are frequently offered options to get a more in-depth description offered on your guide programme. The opulence of the chambers on view, the wonderful paintings and the superb busts and statues of all the former Prime Ministers are really worth seeing. Of course it's the history that really hits you. So many great men and women have walked those hallowed halls. The Jubilee Shop offers some nice but quite expensive souvenirs of your visit but the Cafe has an excellent range of food and at extremely competitive prices. All in all a great place to visit. Two things to remember. Pre-book and get there at least 15 minutes before your tour time. There is are airport style security searches in place."

Contrary to what some people seem to think, you don't need tickets to see a debate: just check online to see when they're on, then turn up within a few hours of the start time and confidently walk up to the guard and say you're there to watch a debate - the guard seemed to be turning away tourists who said they wanted to take a look around, but he let me in. Then you have to go though a security check, do some paperwork, cloak you bags, and wait to be admitted to the chamber (which didn't take long).I saw the House of Lords debate because it's in a fancier room, it was mildly interesting but I couldn't follow it all - not sure if this was because of the acoustics or because of the accents (many of the Lords are appointed rather than hereditary so they don't all sound like Benedict Cumberbatch unfortunately!)."

I've lived in London for years, and have seen the Houses of Parliament from the river umpteen times but never knew that they conduct tours of the building (not did I bothered to check). It was only fairly recently that I went for the guided tour (there are two types of tour - guided and audio), and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. It is an impressive building brimming with pageantry and ceremonial details that are both amusing and venerated. Being a bit of a history buff I had a fantastic time, and our guide was engaging and knowledgeable. The rooms were gorgeous to behold, especially the Lord's Chamber and the Queen's seat within it. The ticket was a bit pricey but well worth it. Attractions in London are notoriously expensive, and I found this to be a more immersive and memorable experience than other famous spots like St Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey (which are wonderful in their own righ, but pales in comparison methinks). So if money is not a huge issue, don't just take photos of the building from the outside, sign up for the guided tour and enjoy an educational trip down the hallowed halls of British history!"

The Barry and Pugin realisation of the 'modern' Palace of Westminster, which is home to the House of Parliament, is a Gothic Revivalist's feast. This amazing riverside edifice, which has been the home of Kings and Queens, the Parliament of England and the Royal Courts of Justice, replaced the medieval building which was destroyed by fire. In turn, the new palace is a survivor of repeated bombing during the WW2 Blitz and, later still, of small but significant attacks by terrorists, protesters and assorted nutters.Yet despite all these changes of bricks and mortar, governance of Britons - wise and foolish, hasty and considered - has emanated from this place since the thirteenth century; almost 1000 years.I have been lucky enough to have had private tours on my several trips to the Houses of Parliament but the website gives very helpful information for new visitors. The Guides all have different interests which translate to delightfully idiosyncratic tours - do try to book onto a tour and be sure to read some background in advance and ask lots of questions.My highlights: Central Lobby mosiacs which depict the patron saints of the British Isles - Ireland being represented by two: Patrick and Brigid; House of Lords Royal Gallery with the sumptious panels by Maclise of the Battle of Waterloo and the death of Nelson at the battle of Trafalgar; the box of sands collected from each of the Normandy D-Day landing beaches in the same room; The Lords Chamber, where you can see the dents from Churchill's signet ring in the Table of the House, made whilst the chamber was used as the temporary Commons Chamber when the 'other place' was damaged by bombing during WW2; House of Commons Members Lobby, where the plain arch into the Commons Chamber is a symbol of the ravages of warfare; Westminster Hall where dozens of heads of state (including Winston Churchill) have lain in state before burial; The Chapel of St Mary's Undercroft, where Emily Wilding Davison hid during the 1911 census to enable her registration address as 'House of Commons', thus making a claim to political rights similar to those of men. [She later died by apparently throwing herself under the King's horse, Anmer, at the 1913 Derby. Five years later (in 1918), nearly 8.5 million women became eligible to vote.]It is possible that more overseas visitors, than citizens of the UK, have visited this ravishing place - you should and must go."

If you are interested in UK history and government or just seeing the inside of this magnificent building this is the place to visit. I did not prebook I just walked up to the ticket office and paid for the audio tour. The trick is to make sure you go to the ticket office first to get your tickets if you have your back to Big Ben and are facing the metro station, follow the building the metro station is in around the right side and the ticket office is located in there. Houses of parliament does not allow for pictures other than the hall when you first walk in. Be prepare to even have to shut your phone off.

It is worth getting there a little early if you can as the tea and scones are some of the best we have tasted."

Some of the info was a little over my head which shows how complicated our political system can be. My only slight niggle is that it was pouring down with rain and my tour was the first tour. They didn't even attempt to let us in a little earlier to save people getting drenched. There was plenty of space once inside so it wasn't a space issue. I was soaking by the time I got in and hadn't arrived too early."

Wish more of the spaces allowed photography -- only the first two -- but quite a tour of English history, from statues or paintings of all their sovereigns (and their consorts -- see Henry VIII lined up with all six!) to famous MPs to bomb damage deliberately left unrestored on Churchill's suggestion. Really brings home the quirky nature of British democracy and its similarities and many differences with the American legislative system."

I enjoy the hustle bustle of people busying themselves on foot, by car, taxi , bicycle , or any other mode of transport getting to and fro from these fantastic buildings, and to watch people stop to hear Big Ben is special. Don't miss a wander down this end of town, when in London, it is truly special, and visitors from all over the world come to see the sights which are quite fantastic. With the statue of Winston Churchill looking over everything and everyone as he did during those bleak war years, while he led our country to victory."

The thing to remember is that no sharps are allowed, so if you carry a pen knife or have something similar on your key chain, its best to leave it at home, or ask for it to be kept in a locker until your return. Security is very good, so expect it to take a while and arrive early to allow for it. So much history is connected to this building, it is certainly worth seeing inside, just remember to book tickets in advance for Saturday, or a long time in advance if you write to your MP, MP arranged tours are generally fully booked six months in advance, but these are only available for those resident in the United Kingdom."

The House of Lords and Royal areas are truly magnificient. The architecture and history most interesting. We booked a Guided Tour but as there were more than one operating at the same time and some guides had louder voices than others it was distracting and made it difficult to hear it all. Maybe the audio tour is better. We followed the Tour with afternoon tea. At a cost of \u00a327.50 we anticipated something nice.We have had many afternoon teas across the Capital and this ranked with the worst. We expected English afternoon tea. The tea was made with teabags!! not as we expected. Then the sandwiches were a smoked salmon and lemon dressing on a small slice of ciabatta, a smoked chicken on a brioche bun and a tomato and mozarella on a small piece of rye bread anything but traditionally British. A small poorly made little to no fruit type scone with a minute amount of jam and clotted cream and then a chocolate and orange tart and a small glass with a type of Eton mess in it and one other cake - I can't even remember it. This was served on a stand with dark little shelves on it not a 3 tier British cake stand. In our opinion this is a British Institution and visitors from far and wide would appreciate a more quintessential English traditional Afternoon Tea. We left very disappointed on many counts and \u00a3150 poorer for 3 afternoon teas and 2 oap guided tours and one adult tour. Happy to pay but expect some value for money"

We opted for guided tour rather than the audio guide and it was completely worth it. Our tour guide was brilliant and was both informative, warm, energetic, and just a pleasure to talk to. It was such an experience being present in the areas where the work of the British gov't takes place and to learn more about the pageantry and ritual involved. While this would have been enough, the various rooms we went to were often gorgeous and filled with lovely paintings and decorations. I'm so glad we were finally able to fit this tour in and only wish we had done it sooner."

The best part about it for me was the entrance hall, preserved from the original building, originally a banqueting hall in the 1000's, later the chamber where Thomas More and others were tried.

However, right from the start, the tour guide was extremely arrogant emphasising what a true \"privilege\" it is to have access to the heart of UK politics-very overzealous indeed. We visited each of the chambers/rooms/cabinets in both the House of Lords and Commons, yet the only real insight we got was of how spectacular the art is; yet this was great to see, as now we can see what the government spends with our tax on....Funding gold furniture. However, I would recommend this tour to any tourists, who want a first glimpse of what the Houses of Parliament are like. If you understand politics and don't want a beginners lesson of how many constituencies there are and who the PM is then I strongly advise you to stay away; especially for the over expensive \u00a325 you have to pay for the tour. The tour duration is around 90 minutes."

I have been to Prime Minister's Questions a few times, and wanted to see more of this impressive building. We decided on a guided tour, which was a good decision as our guide was knowledgeable and informative. Seeing the Lords and Commons close up, as well as the other magnificent parts of the building, the frescos, murals, sculpture etc. made it worth every penny. Only disappointment was that we were not allowed to wander round again afterwards, a puzzling and frustrating decision by them as we would have liked more time to soak up the atmosphere and look around. It was not busy, so we would not have inconvenienced anyone!"

Not sure I should offer my personal experience as a review because my tour of the Palace of Westminster, to give the place its proper title, was not as a tourist or part of any official visitor group.Long story, short version, I am a writer and some of the things I have written are murder mystery type thrillers. One of my stories involved the Prime Minister elect, being murdered on the eve of election victory. Hopefully not a prophesy of things to come next month ! Anyway, at the time what I knew about party politics and Parliamentary procedure you could have written on a fly's butt with a paint brush. Who better to ask than your friendly local Member of Parliament, who through his staff offered to meet me in his office in London. Being somewhat naive I asked for directions, and was told use the London underground service to Westminster, its the big building in front of you DUH !! Upon my arrival my treat started immediately, I had an appointment so I was fast tracked passed the queue of sightseers all the way to main security and once past there I was in, standing mouth open in Westminster Hall, which is the oldest part of the entire palace. The hall is 240 feet long, 68 feet wide and a staggering 92 feet high. There is a large number of magnificent oak beams, spanning the hall with a carved angels looking down upon those below. It is this very hall, that has played such a central role in over 900 years of British history, and where the likes of Sir Thomas Moore, Guy Fawkes and King Charles I were tried and condemned to death.  Of course this is only the way in, and one must climb the stone stairs and turn left and then all of a sudden d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu struck me as I entered the Central Lobby, although I had never been there before, everything looked so familiar to me. Not surprising of course, I have seen countless historical TV documentaries about the place, and seen it on the news but nothing, and I really mean nothing prepares you for that moment when you enter here for the first time. The Central Lobby is where people, like me, come to meet their MPs and where visitors come to attend meetings with MPs and Members of the Lords. It is a large octagonal hall and is the central point between the House of Commons and the House of Lords Chambers. A sort of grand crossroads between the Houses of Parliament.On one side there is a statue of Winston Churchill who appears to be the guardian of the entrance to the Commons Chamber. Look at the left foot of the statue and you will see that it is polished. Members of Parliament touch it on the way into the chamber for luck.I will say no more, if you are planning to go and see for yourselves, I would hate to spoil the experience. If you cannot visit in person there is a virtual web tour.  Members' tours are available to UK residents free of charge and must be sponsored by a Member of Parliament (MP) or a Member of the House of Lords. The tours are led by trained guides.Tours are available to visitors from the UK and overseas on Saturdays throughout the year and on most weekdays during Parliamentary recesses including Easter, Summer and Christmas.Also there is this link http://www.parliament.uk/visiting/visiting-and-tours/tours-of-parliament/guided-tours-of-parliament/"

It should be on any London vistor\u2019s bucket list - easy to book online!

(We took the francophone tour \u2013 expecting it would be a smaller \u2013 it was, there were only four of us! - so there were lots of allusions and comparisons with the French system of government, plus important historical figures, like Napoleon. Guided tours also available in: German, Italian, Spanish, Russian and Mandarin). Historical and political gems included the fact that Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty during the early stages of WWI, assumed responsibility for the debacle at Gallipoli, quit the government, and went to fight as an officer on the Western Front. Don't think you'd find that level of personal accountability in the ministerial ranks of most western government\u2019s today."

Well was I wrong, not only was the audio tour really interesting it explained the history of each room you visit and some facts you would never have thought of happening in a place like this. There are very few restrictions on movement around the building. You can enter both the House of Lords and the House of Commons. You can stand where the party leaders do during PMqs and you really get a feeling for how things work. The staff, from the ladies who gave us our headsets to the security guard who spent a good 5 minutes explaining all about some of the voting systems within the house were outstanding. There is an opportunity to send mail from the post office at the House, it will be stamped the House of Commons which makes an unique gift for \u00a32.43. Much better than I expected and a very rewarding excursion. Will do again for sure."

Through St Stephens Chapel to the Robing room and the Lords. Such rich decor and of course red benches. Then to the more soberly decor of the Commons with green benches.I took the audio guide which was very good and meant you could go at your own pace. Important tip: the stewards are very friendly and helpful and by chatting to them you get some nice little stories which you may otherwise miss. For Example: the Government and opposition benches have red lines in front of them which are two and a half sword lengths apart and if a Member steps on or over the line they are told by the Speaker to 'Toe the line'!!There is just so much wonderful tradition there which some want to modernise. I sincerely hope that NEVER happens.Photography is allowed in the Hall and St Stephens Chapel but nowhere else."

The audio guide is engaging and detailed. We found that unlike the guided tours around us, the audio guide allowed us to linger and marvel at the interior. A nice touch was that there was designated seating for those who needed it, in select rooms. The gift shop was small but had several nice items to pick up as souvenirs. Furthermore, the washrooms at the beginning/end of the tour were very clean and accessible. The only drawback was that the ticket entrance for audio tours and large tour groups appeared to be part of the same line. This caused confusion in the line up, as the tour groups blocked the entrance and the audio guide tourists thought they had to wait in line behind them. The security was very kind and indicated that audio guide tourists could skip the line as long as they had a timed ticket."

You must arrange your tickets on-line in advance, and I believe we may have been required to produce I.D. Small inconveniences for the pay-off. Very knowledgeable tour guides take you through the former castle and modern-day government building. (This tour was offered in at least 4 languages during our visit.) Favorite parts included the long hall with all the large paintings of the monarchs (and the anecdotes about many our guide peppered into his narrative----- King George of Hanover never even bothered to learn English!). Lots and lots of walking on hard floors, so come prepared for that. Very nice little cafe on your way out. Stop in for tea and cake and ask your kids what they liked the best!"

It was all delicious but for \u00a327 each, not worth it at all. Such a shame. We weren't even offered more tea, or water for the pot. We will not be recommending this part of the tour. This would have got a 5 star , but tea let it and us down."

We were told there were no public toilets inside and the nearest were at the Railway Station by Westminster Bridge. After going through Airport type security, we entered Westminster Hall and saw toilets near the gift shop!We did the audio tour which was excellent, easy to follow with lots of detail and lots of extra information. The number signs along the tour which linked to the different parts of the commentary were not always clearly visible. Some of the staff were very abrupt when ushering tourists around. The architecture in this historic building is breathtaking and a real national treasure. You get a real insight into the workings of The Houses of Commons and Lords. The audio tour takes about 90 minutes, but it is really not suitable for young children."

I only recently became aware it was possible to take a guided tour of the Houses of Parliament and after an internet check of the options, I chose to take a guided tour as opposed to an audio tour since I thought that this would provide more information and give the opportunity to ask questions. A tour can only be made when parliament is in recess and at this time of year, Saturdays only, but I was able to easily book a week in advance of my visit.I arrived about half an hour in advance of my allotted time at the Cromwell Green visitor entrance and after the security check the group of around 20 met in Westminster Hall with our excellent guide, Richard. The tour effectively follows the route the Queen takes for the State opening of Parliament starting in the Robing Room, through the Royal Gallery, House of Lords, Central Lobby, Members Lobby and the House of Commons Chamber. The highlights for me were the Houses of Lords and Commons and whilst we were not allowed to sit, we were pemitted to walk up the galleries and stand in front of the benches while Richard gave very interesting information about tradition and history. In the Commons it was possible to stand in front of the Despatch Box and just for a few moments look up at the galleries and think of the statesmen who have stood there over the years making important speeches. It was also possible to stand alongside the Speaker's chair and imagine putting the MP's in their places, (or trying!).The tour in total took and hour and forty five minutes and I loved every one of those minutes. I would like to return but next time, through my MP, seeing PMQ's."

Go to the main hall and check in. Isabel was our tour guide and she gave us a wealth of information about Parliament and the workings of the House of Lords and the House of Commons. The two rooms are so different with the 800 member House of lords having quite ornate and beautiful surroundings as compared to the very basic House of Commons. There are no photographs allowed except in the first two rooms. It was interesting to see where Churchill and the Queen Mother laid in state.

Ok so I will start by saying I am a politics geek, and as I am from New Zealand (our political system is largely based on the Westminster system) I loved seeing where it all happened. So with that in mind you may understand why I had so much fun here. I booked online a few months before to do the guided tour - you need to choose a day and time. Once through security the tour starts in the beautiful Westminster Hall (where you can take photos of yourself standing where William Wallace, Queen Elizabeth, Nelson Mandela and Obama have all stood. The tour winds through St Stephens Hall and to the Lobby (where I found out why lobbyists have that name). We walked to the Southern most buildings where the Queen enters when she visits Parliament - just the wall paintings and ceiling of the Robing Room alone have a thousand stories to tell of the history of the historical relationship between the Crown and Parliament. Back through the red House of Lords (which has the throne where the Queen opens Parliament each year) through to the green House of Commons. As I stood in the House of Commons (which physically does not have enough space for all the Members of Parliament) I thought about how much the buildings had shaped political practice here, and in some ways had limited the ability of Parliament to change with the times. At the end of the tour I wanted to go back through and wander about like those who had opted for the audio-tour, but they told me I couldn't go back. This was disappointing - next time perhaps I will do the audio-tour so I can take my time. The guided tour does take you to rooms that are off limits to the audio-tour, so both options have their benefits. The buildings are beautiful and the history so rich that I imagine that people who are not politics geeks will enjoy it."

It is the 'Palace of Westminster'. The 2 Houses, Lords and Commons, debate and vote here in their respective chambers and this is the face of Parliament most people will recognise from media reporting and television pictures. Most work is done in the committee rooms, a side of government less well-known to many.The public may attend debates and committees but it is best to get there early to queue for the weekly 'Questions to the Prime Minister', which can often seem like theatre rather than government.It is best to check in advance when tours are available or what debates/committees are on.Only UK citizens may ascend Elizabeth Tower (formerly known as The Clock Tower or wrongly as Big Ben) and this must be arranged months in advance through the local Member of Parliament."

I recently contacted our local MP as I read that they will give short guided tours to constituents, well I'm glad I did because a planned one hour stay turned into 3 and half hours!Access was quite easy with usual security checks and we were met 9am prompt in the central lobby, from there we had the grand tour with a personal commentary on the history, pageant and workings of parliament from an MPs point of view.The highlights were obviously the 2 houses but also going behind the scenes and onto the terrace.It was a Wednesday so PMs QT day which we were told was full, however as we were watching the speaker enter the house, our MP came looking for us and I managed to get tickets for us, this was tremendous to watch, not just because of the 2 leaders battling it out but also seeing what's going on with the backbenches as well.There is a nice coffee shop and shop off Westminister Hall which we used after our tour ended and before the start of house business.Many thanks to David Hanson for his time and effort in making it a fantastic experience."

Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and was so interesting, that unfortunately the 90 minutes flew by, we would happily have listened on a lot longer. You can do an audio tour but I'm glad we didnt, as out guide was so good. We visisted the house of Lords and Commons, but lots of other areas too, that were absolutely beautiful and full of history. I agree this tour would not be suitable for young children, but for anyone with any interest in politics or not , I think this visit is a definite must.We had lunch in the coffee shop there too, which was surprisingly inexpensive.This was definitely a highlight of our trip!"

You retrace the route taken by Her Majesty the Queen when she visits to for the State Opening of Parliament through lavishly decorated lobbies and corridors before entering the spectacular House of Lords Chamber. It is so beautiful it is hard to know where to look! Central Lobby and the House of Commons follow. I strongly suggest hanging back from the rest of your group when you leave the Commons and standing at the Prime Minister's Dispatch Box for a few seconds - I did and it was an awesome feeling to stand where so many great (and some not so great) leaders have stood, albeit for 10 seconds. St Stephen's Hall and Westminster Hall are a grand conclusion to the tour - but come rugged up if you visit in winter because it is FREEZING in this part of the building! If I could suggest one improvement to the tour it would be to spend more time looking at and explaining the various large paintings and statues scattered in the building. This would allow Britons and foreigners alike to better understand the history which abounds in the walls of this unique building."

We also were allowed to visit the chapel and the terrace which is not allowed on the regular public tour. The chapel is medieval but restored by Victorians and is stunningly beautiful. For many years it was used as a stable. The terrace gives great views of London. We were also allowed to visit the broom cupboard where a suffragette spent the night. You get perspective on size. Westminster Hall is massive, but the House of Commons and House of Lords are tiny in comparison. The Lords is far more opulent than the Commons.

(In fact, Big Ben is actually the bell inside the tower.)The Parliament is made up of two houses, - the House of Commons and the House of Lords and both have their meeting chambers here. It is possible to take a tour of the building or watch a debate or question time. Once a year, usually around May, the Queen visits and from her throne in the House of Lords officially opens the new session of Parliament.

No.hiMind you glad we didnt have a guide after eavesdropping on their dialogue; child's stuff.The building was massive and impressive, very small gift shop, with over priced irrelevant gifts.Online booking said you could take tea on the river side WHERE? We found an over priced cafe, def not near a river"

Our guide Helen took us from the incredible 13th century Westminster Hall along the length of the Palace of Westminster to the House of Lords and we then worked our way along the building visiting key rooms as we went. We started in the Queens robing room and from there made our way through the Royal Gallery to the House of Lords. Be prepared to be blown away...the amount of bling in the House of Lords was incredible. We then travelled through the central lobby through to the \"Ayes to the right\" division room and from there into the House of Commons. Helen was very good and gave us lots of historical information about the building, the origins of our democracy and some fun facts to be going on with. Although expensive (at \u00a325 per head) the tour lasted for nearly 2 hours and really isn't to be missed. Try to do this when the MPs and Lords are out on holiday so as to see everything unhindered."

Visitors who wanted to listen to extra information on particular subjects could press a button on their handsets, but those who did not could simply move on: an additional feature that I found particularly useful.Plus, as I understand it, there was a different audio tour available that was tailored for younger children that could be completed alongside their parents.I ought to point out that photography and video recording is not permitted anywhere on the tour. Pre-booking is advised, especially during busy periods."

The Commons chamber is fascinating - you can visualise all the PM's and other big names through recent times standing just in front of you.

I got a thrill from standing in both chambers of Parliament. You literately see where history is made. The main pleasure of the tour for me was the stories told by the guide.

The adult commentary was also interesting and it was fascinating to be in the places you normally only see on telly. I suspect though that you would learn more about the workings of Parliament on a guided tour - we listened in to a couple of groups for a short while and they seemed to get more about the human side of it, whereas the audio tour tended to focus more on the architecture and decoration. On the whole though it was well worth the time and money spent."

Firstly we were asked quite rudely to wait outside until a counter became available, then were had to wait whilst the lady behind the counter hand wrote our tickets. Everyone else was given printed tickets, it was not explained why ours were hand written or guarantee given that they would be valid. We were not given directions to the entrance either (across the road and down a bit). However once inside, our tour guide was great. I didn't catch her name but she has pink hair! The tour ran over by 25 mins but no one seemed to care as she was knowledgable and willing to answer all our questions. We were slightly disappointed that we did not necessarily learn anything new that we had not heard on the programme or already knew. We were also hoping to see some of the behind the scenes bars and tea rooms however the 2hrs 10 mins were packed with information and history. We are stilling giving this 4 stars as the guide was excellent and gave us plenty of time, however the customer service of the ticket office need some work."

So I guess you could say we had a special interest in buildings. The scale was not what I expected, some parts quite modest and others very grand and ornate. In all a fascinating place.The only blot was the most awful guide we had, I can only assume that she was once a school teacher as she spent the tour scolding us, like a teenage class, berating one of our group for a 'silly question that surely they must have learnt in school' I am afraid she really ruined the place for us, really could not cope with being asked questions and kept making her own political view quite clear. Shame I can't imagine we were a difficult crowd, interested, inquisitive, a touch challenging perhaps when one or two of the group gave an answer with sources for a question another of the group asked.To credit the organises they have offered us another tour.Suitability, well I guess my kids would be bored rigid as would many younger people, however if you have a sense of history, or time and place, or romance ( not in a lovey dovey way) you may just love it"

We recognised a few faces!The tour guide was very well informed and had a friendly mannerism. Lots of history and culture. We saw MPs debating on Health issues in the House of Commons. Walked through the Red House of Lords but not allowed to sit!!! My children and I enjoyed it- would recommend it to all. So much to take in and learn from,Were allowed to take one photograph on the steps before entering the main building, so able to keep as a souvenir. Price seemed reasonable to be honest when you think that this is one of Britain's top attractions, as well as a real life part of British history.We thoroughly enjoyed our day put at Westminster."

We were not rushed at all and were able to ask the very knowledgeable guide as many questions as we wanted.It was fascinating from start to finish and being there in person made all the many pictures previously seen come to life before my own eyes. If you are a lover of gigantic oil paintings then you will not be disappointed as the corridor walls between the two houses are hung all the way along.Many of the quaint customs of the workings of Parliament were explained to us and helped to make the visit a memorable one."

It's hard to take in the world changing stuff that has gone on in there. Seeing the throne, House of Commons, House of Lords etc, listening to the history, I could have stayed all day. All the stuff you had to learn at school , just comes alive here.Tea on the terrace. What can I say. Not cheap, but a once in a life time thing to do. You are met by a Queens Messager and escorted to the members terrace. Amazing views of the Thames. The little cakes and nibbles were gorgeous, endless cups of tea.A fantastic experience all round. There is so much I didn't know about how my country is run."

I was more interested in how debates are conducted than in the architecture or the celebrities. I stayed for more than 90 minutes and heard an excellent, reasoned, informed debate on cancer prevention. Political point-scoring was minimal, the standard of delivery was admirable. Clearly, some Members were speaking to their own constituencies or reflecting the interests of some of the many NGOs active in this area. That said, following a good debate, the Government Minister, in responding, picked up on and responded positively to the central points made. I left that place with a lighter heart than when I arrived. Some of that may be due to the 90 minute rest that I had sitting on the public benches. But I think that it was in no small measure optimism that in the corridors of power this plague is being debated constructively.Entrance was non-fussy, well signposted. Ask any policeman if the Commons is sitting and if so where to seek entrance."

I was all set to be bored by the tour but I found the audio really interesting and we moved along fast. It was fascinating seeing the Houses of Commons and Lords and beautiful ornate architecture. Not sure why we were allowed to take pics in some parts and not in others but I guess they have their reasons. Onto the tea, firstly I somehow booked the tour and tea for different days by mistake. Don't know how this happened but they were very accomodating about it and managed to fit us in. That's a big positive. The food was very nice but there really wasn't enough of it. 3 small sandwiches, one small scone and 2 small desserts each. We go for teas often and this really was the most stingy offering we've experienced, especially for the amount charged. But my real issue was it said on the ticket tea would be served in the grandeur of the Pugin Room. Unless I'm mistaken we couldn't have been in this room as it had no grandeur and looked more like a marquee, but there was no mention so that was rather strange. My advise to others visiting for tea, is eat before you go..."

We went during the Summer when parliament was closed but the building, the artwork and the history were all superb. Will definitely go again and thoroughly recommend it."

Also afforded us every opportunity to ask questions & have a good look around each part before moving on. None of the hustle & rush you get with a lot of guided tours. The guide made sure that we were in the Central lobby in plenty of time to see the Mace procession into the House of Commons. Prime Ministers questions was exactly as I expected. The School children I was in charge of were better behaved than the so called leaders of the Country. Absolute nonsense, they ought to be ashamed of themselves. After PMQ's the House emptied like a fire bell had gone off. Honest, the MP's were out of the House BEFORE the people watching from the public gallery. Overall thoroughly enjoyed the visit simply because of the tour guide, he was brilliant. Wish I could remember his name so I could thank him personally.

We stood amidst the benches in both Houses (seating by the public is prohibited) and were able to capture some of the atmosphere of the debating chambers. I loved the Division lobbies and the full explanation of the voting process. We should be thankful Tony Blair was outvoted in his attempt to introduce electronic voting!

There is so much history within the walls of the Palace of Westminster and I suppose we do forget that it did started out as a palace. There is also amazing art work such as portraits of Henry the VIII and his wives, Queen Victoria and Nelson just to name a few. Another area we visited had statues and busts of past prime ministers, Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and many more.There are guidelines to be observed when visiting, you can't sit in certain areas but this was pointed out to us by our guide, I wish I could remember his name because he was a brilliant guide. Hats have to be removed before the tour starts and our guide was also asked to mention to someone within the party to remove the chewing gum they were chewing. I think it makes a pleasant change that there is a certain etiquette to follow on this tour and at the end of the day this is what makes places like this somewhere special to visit. I highly recommend the escorted tour!"

The voting area wherein members need to pass thru an earmarked area was quite informative and interesting. The guide did a splendid job with all details from ancient history related to the Parliament and British monarchy.

You can book tickets online well ahead of time, so you don't have to wait as you do at most London attractions. We were there during a busy holiday week, so it was good that we booked in advance, but I think if you're in London at slower times, you can find a tour time pretty easily at the last minute. The groups are small, 10 people or less, so you aren't jostling with crowds. They offer an audio tour, but I can't imagine why you'd do that. Our guide was an older woman, charming, knowledgeable and really seemed to like showing us around. You see pretty much everything you'd want, including getting to stand in the actual house chambers. Great combination of history and current political interest. You have to go through security. It's pretty quick and efficient, but make sure you allow time for that.

The other issue I have is over photography, considering there is so much TV coverage and high definition TV's why can't visitors take pictures except in the first two halls?

The audio tour is excellent and as you wlak around the building and are prompted to key in the next number on the guide you are also given the option to listen to additional commentaries on different subjects. The guide covers the building, the parliamentray system and also its history. There is even a special childrens audio guide which my son enjoyed. There was alot of security at the entrance but everyone was very friendly. There were also staff around the building who were answering questions."

The tour looked interesting from the description on the website, but based on how restrictive tours of the U.S. Capitol building have become, I was not expecting more than a cursory view of the building and rooms. I was exceptionally surprised at both how accessible the audio tour was, and the excellent information provided through the audio recording. The security staff were very polite and welcoming. The ability to walk through so much of the building, including right onto the floors of both the House of Lords and the House of Commons was amazing. There were no crowds at all. If you are in anyway a student of history or political science, I highly recommend the tour. It was well worth the time and was very interesting. To those who have visited the U.S. Capitol in the past 10 years (I work in D.C.), this tour is much more welcoming, enjoyable, informative, and you are not made to feel like a security threat in visiting. Unlike the U.S. Capitol tour, this one I highly recommend."

The only other piece of feedback for the venue is that the shop appeared to be a complete rip off e.g. Small portcullis magnet \u00a38.95. Everything we picked up seemed ridiculously over priced."

We had a terrific guide (Shellah) who walked us through the gigantic structure following the course that the Queen takes for the opening of parliament. The tour doesn't just cover England's parliamentary system but also gives a great perspective on the history, art and architecture of the building. We found it interesting and really informative. It's a fairly lengthy tour of about 1.5 hours, so I wouldn't recommend it for young kids. My 17 year old son is studying law and politics in high school and quite enjoyed the tour. In terms of value for money I found this tour superior to the Tower of London tour, which was very good, but uncomfortably crowded (though in fairness we probably hit Tower of London at its peak of busyness)."

            "review": "Visiting the place you spend your whole life seeing on TV!. Me and my brother visited in January 2014 because we were in London and fancied doing some touristy things.It made clear when we booked online that the security was like airport security - and that's very much the case - expect to empty your pockets, go through a metal detector, have bags go through the x-ray scanner and possibly be patted down by a guard. Be sure to check the website thoroughly and ensure you're not carrying any prohibited items.Even when we got through security there's still armed police hanging about, and the tour guide told us that we must keep our passes visible at all times, that we weren't allowed to take photographs, nor were we under any circumstances allowed to stray from our allocated tour group. He didn't exactly say what would happen if we did, but I got the impression you'd likely be met with some degree of hostility!Arrived in Westminster Hall to wait for the tour to start - this is where they've got plenty of leaflets and a well-stocked gift shop.When the tour started it was immediately obvious to me why the security is so overbearing, every single room of this building is a national treasure! The attention to detail is absolutely staggering - there isn't a wall or ceiling in the whole building that hasn't got some magnificent painting, wonderful stained-glass window, or sculpture made of gold or something - even without the history being a factor, this place is worth a visit purely on the basis of it being such a glorious architectural spectacle.We visited on a Saturday and so parliament wasn't in session - this suited us perfectly because it meant we got to go in the house of commons and house of lords chambers. I had always thought the public weren't ever allowed in there but it turns out I was wrong - and I found it to be a magical experience - unexpectedly walking past the dispatch box where the PM stands, I don't know how I can emphasise how magical I found it - you know when you're having problems with a significant other, and everything sort of seems irrelevant compared to love - well I think this is the kind of place that was epic enough to have distracted me (Tower of London earlier that day didn't manage it!).Also must mention the tour guide - he was brilliant - very friendly and knowledgeable. The tone of his tour was quite refreshing too, I thought it'd be quite formal and stuffy but he didn't mind having a laugh about things and making jokes about the popularity (or lack thereof) of certain politicians.Definitely recommend. If you live in the UK and watch the news occasionally then you need to come here once in your life.Top tips1.) VISIT ON A WEEKEND OR WHEN PARLIAMENT NOT IN SESSION SO YOU CAN GO IN CHAMBERS2.) No photos allowed3.) Check security guidance before visiting, many items prohibited4.) Don't get too hung up on looking at what the guide is saying, take time to take in your surroundings"

It seems that groups of up to about 20 can arrange this fairly easily, first thing in the morning before the Houses sit and with advance notice (we wrote in 2-3 months ahead). As such we had fuller access to the many parts of the building including both Chambers, than in the more limited public tours. It is a very impressive building even though the magnificent Westminster Hall is the only really historic part, and much bigger than it looks from the outside. There are innumerable attractive artworks and artifacts of interest, although necessarily heavy on Victoriana, given that so much of the earlier stuff must have been destroyed in the 1834 fire. The Guides are really knowledgeable but ours seemed to stick to a prepared script. Given the composition of our particular group, he underestimated our level of knowledge of both the political process and history, so it was mostly through questions that we learned anything new. We did feel rather hassled to move on, as a result of all our questions. Having said that, it was thoroughly worthwhile and we felt very privileged to walk on such hallowed ground.DO follow the instructions to arrive early, the security process is very lengthy indeed, airport-plus.There is quite a nice cafe to sit in afterwards and digest all you have seen.I was in a wheelchair after knee surgery and was easily accommodated, indeed I saw even more of the corridors of power than my friends, including the famous turntable in the inner courtyard for turning round Royal Mail vans.."

The House of Lords was having work done to the room but we looked through windows inside and it was incredibly ornate looking from where we were standing. We saw how and where MPs vote and loads more as well, including the chapel under Westminster Hall, although this is rarely open. Westminster Hall was fascinating and is the first point you enter after the long security check (taking off bags and outer clothing to go through a scanner as at airports and some people get searched although you can take your bag and coat around everywhere with you (possibly not to watch debates though )). We learnt so much and were so grateful to the gentleman who took us around for much more than an hour and will definitely be back to do the audio tour in the future, although it is expensive, because my brain isn't able to retain a lot, but the huge amount of info we were given couldn't have been better presented and again we are really grateful for a brilliant tour."

If you are a resident of the UK you can book a tour via your local MP for free which I did although I had to wait about 6 months. However, it was well worth the wait because their were 5 members of my family on the tour so we did save money. Even if you're not very political I would still advise this tour because the Houses of Parliament is such a beautiful building steeped in history it was just a pleasure to visit."

During the year this normally only occurs in Saturdays, although there are also timeslots available on most weekdays during Parliamentary recesses such as 19 December 2014 \u2013 2 January 2015 (except 24-26th December, 1st January), 13-20 February 2015, 31st March \u2013 6 May 2015 (except 3, 6 30 April 2015). English guided tours start every 15 to 20 minutes during the day and there are also three times daily visits for French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, and Mandarin visitors (be careful not to get on the wrong tour). The cost is 25 pounds and the tour last 100 minutes. Tickets are best purchased online viahttps://visit.parliament.uk/HouseofParliament/shop/ViewItems.aspx?CG=TOUR&C=HOPATThe tour is fantastic and takes you through all the major segments of the palace of Westminster including the Westminster hall, house of commons, house of lords, Queens robbing room, royal gallery, etc. Even to a non UK citizen the internal elements of this building is well worth seeing and the tour adds in essential context and history that you would otherwise not understand. I would certainly recommend it to others. Of course, the self guided audio tour is an option, but I believe the guided tour is worth the money.Be sure to arrive 20 minutes before the tour is to commence as you have to go through a fairly extensive security check, which often has a queue."

Take the guided tour which is the same price (16 pounds).The quality of such tours often depends on the qualities of teh guide and I had real luck 0 but I feel the overall calibre of the guides in Parliament is very very high.Did you know the Queen of England is not allowed into the House of Commons. I didn't but if you take the tour you will find out why.By the way after the tour you can have access to the tea room for afternoon tea if you have pre-booked. Do not do it.

I joined a group of supporters of the charity \"Contact the Elderly\" which encourages inter-generational links and is dedicated to tackling loneliness and social isolation by organising local tea parties. As a personal volunteer, and also a corporate sponsor, I was invited to a drinks reception followed by a tour, led by Finchley MP Mike Freer. Security was relatively straightforward - much as you might find in any airport nowadays - and then we found ourselves in Westminster Hall, the oldest existing part of the Palace of Westminster, which was erected in 1097! For the most part, this is a very large, but empty (and cold!) space, but the ceiling is impressive and the history vast.Guided down corridors of statues and paintings, we arrive in Central lobby, and you begin to see the sort of impressive detail that makes the Palace of Westminster such a special place. From this point, the House of Commons is in one direction and, directly opposite sit the House of Lords. We were lucky enough to visit both.From the outside, this is a mightily impressive building - the detail is astonishing. However, even that did not prepare me for the House of Lords, which was simply breathtaking. Our guide recounted some interesting anecdotes whilst we admired the quality, the cleanliness and the tradition. A hugely enjoyable experience, and a tourist must (though I cannot vouch for the quality of any other tours)."

Nothing about the very different operations of the House of Commons, or the military coup that ended in the beheading of Charles II. (I can understand why they steer clear of current issues, but there was virtually no historical coverage. The Parliament building from the 17th century no longer stands, but the present building is on the same site.I was so bored! The queen walks on a blue carpet when she visits. The painter of the House of Lords frescos was Irish, (Daniel Maclise was a great painter, but that wasn't mentioned, just his nationality.)And uncomfortable--a two hour tour where we had to stand, except for a five minute break. The tour guide for some reason started to remind me of Hyacinth Bucket on the old Britcom \"Keeping Up Appearances\" and the tour went downhill for me after that.Not to be wholly negative, the final coverage of the historical functions of Westminster Hall was moving."

It is possible to attend debates in the public gallery but again unless you have a free ticket access will not be given unless you're prepared to risk it and queue but ticket-holders are given priority. But it is worth it especially when rumbunctious MPs like the Labour Party's Dennis Skinner take to the floor. Known colloquially as the Beast of Bolsover, he was checked by The Speaker just a few days ago for declaring that half the members of the opposition are crooks. The House of Commons Speaker gave the request: \"Please retract\". And quick as a flash Skinner replied: \"OK. Half the members of the opposition are not crooks\".

UK residents can get a free tour by writing to their MP at least 6 months ahead. This is what we did. Even then be careful to pick a good day when the Chambers are not in use. You can get into the Westminster Hall part easily though and can also see debates. There is always a queue and the best way again is to write to your MP, especially for Prime Ministers Questions. Out tour guide was really knowledgeable about the building etc It was really interesting to see the emphasis in the pictures etc of Britain\u2019s greatness in the world no wonder our leaders think they can sit at the top table as of right.

We could not book a tour in time. But had a quick walk around the place. It was so gorgeous. We note that back then it started off like a King's Council.

The tour guide was a very pleasant lady who knew her facts about the history of the building and main details. The total tour was about 2 hours in length and there are few times when a seat is possible. Some people with functional mobility problems will find the tour too tiring. Both the Houses of Lords and Commons were included in the tour. Having visited both Houses in the past in an official capacity one would recommend this tour to UK and Overseas visitors for the accuracy of the information provided as well as the welcomming approach of the guide. The afternoon tea on the Commons Terrace was very well presented, delicious and in a reasonable proportion. Recommended for all ages except the very young children and those with walking difficulties. There are the now standard security searches and no photographs are permitted. Visitors on a weekend day are unlikely to catch a glimps of MPs or Life Peers."

Personally I find it offensive that our representatives are difficult to access behind this level of security.Secondly, if we had identity cards then one could separate UK citizens from general tourists and provide a fast track accessCurrently one spends up to 30 minutes or more lining up to go through security exposed to the weather while after security the walkway is covered. A canopy over the access queue is an urgent necessityThe reward is to access the House through the magnificent St Stephens Hall, one of the wonders of the Middle Ages. After that one is in the midst of high Victorian Gothic looking a little tired at times but one has t realise that this is a working place. Maybe it should become a Museum or for state showpiece events and the Parliament reconstructed and moved to Manchester"

The entrance is very grand and you can take photos which is nice but further in the building photography is not allowed. We had an audio tour which was very informative. You will end up with a cricked neck from looking up at the beautiful ceilings! It was quite surreal that we were actually standing in areas which we had seen on television numerous times.

We had prebooked tickets, but had not printed them out, and we expected to just appear at a will-call window to receive them. That didn't happen. Rather, young people kept running back and forth between our line and some office with hand written notes of information on people who were wanting to pick up their tickets. If it had been raining (thankfully it wasn't) we would have been furious.

For those who have never been do try and go for it is an experience I shall never forget.Our guide, David, was absolutely brilliant, very knowledgeable and made the guided tour so enjoyable. From the moment we stepped into Westminster Hall I knew this place was going to leave a lasting impression on me. To actually step into the House of Commons Chamber and the House of Lords Chamber felt such a great occasion to me. After the tour the Jubilee Cafe offered a very nice cup of coffee.I managed to obtain a copy of The Palace of Westminster Official Guide on line from their Bookshop, very well worth \u00a35, post free. In the future I wish to return, for you simply cannot take it all in solely on one visit."

The audio commentary was clear and well sign posted and you had the option of hearing more about a number of topics if you wanted. You can certainly get the impression of all the meetings that happen in the corridors and the only thing that could improve the tour would be to get an insight into the offices. I would even consider a revisit! However - we also booked an afternoon tea and this was disappointing (I didn't include this in the review rating as it was booked separately). We were served in the Marquee overlooking the Thames but the food was minimal and the tent unatmospheric.

The official guided tour is well worth the effort as he/she gives extra little anecdotes which makes it all more worth while. With an official guide you do get to go places ordinary self-guided tourists don't get to go. The debating chambers are smaller than they appear on TV but very impressive and imposing. There are gorgeous paintings, murals, carpets, chairs etc. The division lobbies are fascinating and many of the processes are quite old fashioned but work well nonetheless.

Annoyingly you have to book your tour before you can proceed to book tea (why aren't they bundled?) so you can print your tour tickets at home but you have to pick your tea tickets up at Portcullis House on the day. I had allowed for a long queue for ticket pickup but it was surprisingly fast consequently we had plenty of time to have a drink in the nearby St Stephen's Tavern prior to joining the security line up. Westminster Hall where you muster for tours is full of history: it should be after nearly 900 years of usage: so make sure you have sufficient time to take it in either before or after your tour. I found our tour guide very knowledgeable about Parliamentary History and Procedures and she very competently gave us a very good tour. I found she was a little lacking in contextual history outside of Parliament but that's me being picky.Nothing can prepare you adequately for the sheer impressiveness of the House of Lords. There is so much history imbedded in the adornment of that Chamber you just come away in awe. The commons though far more impressive than its equivalents in Canada and Australia just pales into the background when compared to the Lords.Tea was an experience' , price is about what the hotels charge for similar fare: if its just food you want you can do so for far less in many places I suspect most folks just want to soak in the atmosphere though.All the staff at ticket offices, security, guiding, marshalling and serving were extremely polite and friendly a true credit to Britain.Whether a native or a foreign tourist this is a must see if you are in London when Parliament is open for tours."

We went in April, so I can't really remember many names of the rooms, but the House of Commons and House of Lords are definitely worth a visit. The lady who was our guide, was extremely knowledgeable and precise. she answered any questions we had and explained in detail certain aspects of the tour. The way a guide should be.I was taken back by the upkeep of each room and well preserved statues, books and furniture were. The history of the Houses of Parliaments is fascinating. All staff are very friendly and on site to help at any point.The tour guide also advised us that we could take a tour of Big Ben and explained the full process of how to go about requesting a tour.

We were shown around by a lovely lady, who was very knowledgable, very genuine, and not too tour guide-ish. She answered all of our questions with great aplomb, and allowed us to stop and stare as we wished. Sadly no photos allowed, but a huge honour to be able to walk around and see such an historic and important building. Great to see schools visiting as well, and asking questions of their local MPs. This should be a must for any young person, as its a great way to really understand the whole process of voting and decision making in Britain."

The guides are brilliant - incredibly well informed. They tell you not only about the various halls, palaces and rooms but also how the British parliament works. The tour lasts an hour and 40 minutes and takes in Westminster Hall, St. Stephen's Hall, the House of Lords and the HOuse of Commons. There is an good caf\u00e9 there and toilet facilities are excellent. Photography is allowed only in Westminster Hall and St. Stephen's Hall. There is seating at some of the stops, but you are frequently not allowed to sit on the seats used by MPs and Lords. You need to have photographic identification and you have to go through an airport style security section to enter the buildings. It's not that much of a problem, though, although on occasions you may have to wait 20 minutes or so. You can take in cameras and small bags, but there is no storage space for bags - and large bags are not allowed."

The auto guide headset was excellent, the commentary very informative and the musical introductions spectacular. We stood on the spot where William Wallace and later Charles the First were tried for treason. We got right up close and personal with the House of Lords and Commons. We stood right at the places where so many dramatic debates have taken place. Some of the rooms within the House of Lords areas were wonderfully lavish and a treat to behold."

            "review": "You can feel the history in this building. I booked a guided tour via Ticketbastard (I mean Ticketmaster) for Tuesday late morning. Note, you should arrive at least 20 minutes early because you have to go through airport type security. Once you enter the building, you need to wait for the tour to begin in Westminster Hall, which is a very large space. Note, you cannot take pictures inside the Palace of Westminster except in Westminster Hall which makes the experience a bit disappointing.The guided tour was very good. The tour guide was a bit hard to hear at times, mostly because of the presence of other tour groups in our vicinity. I believe a guided tour does give you access to a room used for conferences (that would not be available with the audio tour) and perhaps gives you a chance to stand for extended periods in the House of Commons and House of Lords chambers at the seating areas. I believe you may not be able to do a few things if you took the regular audio tour. The tour guide provided a fascinating history of the building, the politicians who legislated in the Parliament, the differences between the two chambers, why the queen cannot enter the House of Commons, how the royals fit in, where the queen sits in the House of Lords, and more! There is also plenty of art and statues that litter the buildings. You could definitely feel the building ooze history. It was well worth the high cost of the tickets.There is a cafe but we did not eat at the cafe.Note, we also ordered the afternoon tea with the tour. You can only order the combination afternoon tea and guided tour over the telephone. Unfortunately, Ticketmaster (who took our phone call) mistakenly sold tickets for the tour and afternoon tea to take place on a Tuesday. We would only learn later - the night before the tour via a phone call by Ticketmaster who then left a voicemail - that the afternoon tea was canceled! I was naturally furious why Ticketmaster decided to give us such short notice of the cancellation. I talked with the folks at the Parliament and they told us that Ticketmaster erroneously offered Tuesday afternoon teas! The Palace of Westminster supposedly does not offer afternoon tea on Tuesdays. But for some reason (I guess this is the way Ticketmaster operates), Ticketmaster did not mention their mistakes. I was naturally outraged at the way Ticketmaster handled this situation and did not own up to the fact that they made a mistake. The afternoon tea was to be one of the highlights of my trip. I was finally able to reach a Ticketmaster manager who eventually took care of the situation and was able to find me an opening for afternoon tea two days later. But this was only after I got upset and just told her I would accept nothing but a new reservation for afternoon tea. Lesson of this story - be aware of Ticketmaster!Anyway, the afternoon tea itself at the Palace at Westminster was a bit disappointing. The tea is offered in an area at river level right next to the Thames. You have an excellent view of the river. The dining area is nicely appointed and clean. We were promptly seated, but it did take quite a while for us to receive the food. The afternoon tea items were very limited (small portions). Menu items included a small roll with roast chicken/pepper/avocado guacamole, smoked salmon with cream cheese on ciabatta, tomatoes/mozarella/pesto with pine kernels on rye bread. Sweets included scones with strawberry jam/clotted cream, chocolate tart, and lychee/strawberry Eton mess shot. You also have a choice of various teas (including coffee). You can also pay extra for wine. The food was average - not spectacular at all, although the teas were good. The presentation of the food was nice. However, the service was very poor. The manager was very hospitable, but the waiters were very impatient, did not describe the food at all - the waiter just dumped the food on our table and then just walked away. It seemed like the waiters were in a constant rush throughout the meal and were not very attentive. I thought it would be a highlight of my trip but the experience was underwhelming. I would rate the afternoon tea separately at 2 out of 5 stars."

I'd recommend this tour for everyone just to understand what does Britain means for British people and why. In this place one can feel how past centuries and meantime connected to each other. Some notes for a first-time visitors. Photography is only allowed in Westminster hall. In the rest of Parliament neither photography nor video recording are allowed. On entrance, be ready and prepared for extensive airport-like checking, so perhaps avoid taking large bags, bottles or excessive iron things. Take a guided tour in your language to get the most of this place."

We booked online some weeks before and this is clearly advisable since there was no availability for a tour on the day of our visit. You can book a fully guided tour or an audio tour which costs slightly less. Our preference was for the audio tour which is available in several languages and gives you the flexibility of walking around at your own pace and revisiting areas should you wish to do so. The commentary was clear and very interesting. Highlights for me were visits to the House of Lords and the House of Commons but the entire building is steeped in history and there is much to see and learn. If you have even the slightest interest in politics, this tour is a must and you should allow a minimum of 90 minutes to get around. Sadly, we weren't able to use our cameras as photography is forbidden in most areas. There is a small gift shop alongside the Jubilee Caf\u00e9 which serves tea, coffee, sandwiches etc and has glass doors leading to an outdoor block of Portaloos which as far as I could tell, were the only conveniences available. If you're visiting London, you should definitely consider this tour. I don't think you'll be disappointed."

In London with an organised group to see Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace (see separate review). Being mildly interested in UK politics, and frequently watching PMQ\u2019s on TV whilst we lunch, we were keen to see the actuality of the chambers of the Commons and the Lords.We had the use of a tour guide (which I would recommend over an audio tour). Our guide was both knowledgeable, witty and entertaining and made the whole experience very interesting, with a very good balance between aspects historical and political. After passing through the usual security search our tour started in Westminster Hall, a stunning huge building with the most impressive oak hammerbeam roof. The history of this building started with William Rufus in 1099 (see \u2013 we were paying attention). With all the visitors milling around, some of the majesty and mystery of this building is lost, but it is nevertheless a most impressive start to the tour, and this is about the only part of the old Palace of Westminster which survived the 1834 fire. The building which we now commonly call the Houses of Parliament was completed 1847/1850 and the architecture and decoration is stunning \u2013 a magnificent example of Victorian wealth and aspiration. We were stunned by the wealth of frescos and paintings everywhere and the copious amount of gold leaf decoration.There are a few stairs at the start of the tour, but after this progress is at a modest pace and we were allowed to sit occasionally to rest (though NOT in the Commons or the Lords!). After the tour we didn\u2019t bother with the gift shop or caf\u00e9, though the toilets (in temporary modules) were clean and presentable.Regardless of what you might think of politicians, the sheer history of this building makes it a \u201cmust see\u201d at least once in your lifetime."

Those who have seen my other reviews will have noted that I live in London and have done a whole bunch of things in this city -not all of which have even made it to Tripadvisor it must be said, but of all of them, I think this i probably the best I have done.I am interested in British politics and no doubt, I think you have to be to enjoy this. If you're not interested or don't already have a grasp of how the British governmental system works, it might be advisable to skip this. If you do, read on...The building itself is magnificent. The huge win for me was the tour. Our tour guide was exceptionally knowledgeable about how government works, the history of UK government, the history of the building and the history of the relationship between monarchy and the UK government. Fascinating!As an Englishman, the chance to see the inside of the house of lords and the house of commons -two rooms, which every single English person will certainly recognise, was a real win for me. As you're talked through how debates and things work at this level and how the modern day has collided and blended (sometime awkwardly) with centuries old traditions, the amazement just keeps growing!Entry is not expensive and well worth it. Kids will find this very boring. Also, one of our party was in a wheelchair and I can say that access here and there was a little difficult in a couple of areas, but the staff helped to overcome this easily.I am very critical usually of gift shops and cafes at attractions like this. In this case, I have to be same... Everything in the gift shop is tat and nonsense. Nothing useful or a unique reminder of the experience available for you. The cafe food is actually delicious. The cost however, is exorbitant which on it's own is OK IF the quality is high also. In this case, you're paying very high cost for very mediocre quality product. People often say \"yeah, well, you expect that at tourist attractions though, don't you\"... In my view, that's not a good excuse... if you charge your patrons a lot of money, then you are obliged to supply a high quality product. This is my own negative point.HIGHLY recommend this, though I repeat; personally, I think it is absolutely necessary that you're interested not only in the architecture (which debatibly is worth the visit on its own), but also in the governmental process of the UK and it's history."

Unless you really have a keen interest in the history of UK Politics, you will likely find the tour quite boring. This is because a lot of the focus on the tour is on the politics that have happened in the building, rather than the building itself. Instead you could do the audio tour and probably be just as happy, and have it take a lot less time. Additionally, I found that the tour didn\u2019t really give you a complete view of the building. Instead you see a few of the common rooms, but nothing \u201cspecial\u201d like the bar (yes - there is a bar in there), the offices of the politicains.Overall it is something to experience!"

The guide made the whole experience so interesting and I would recommend this to anyone visiting London although of course you can only see it when Parliament are not sitting."

Our guide told us about the past and current events in both houses and I must say the time passed very quickly. This is a must visit when in London."

Small queue to enter but actually inside the building by the time allocated where we collected an audio tour guide (included in the ticket price). We were able to walk around at leisure listening to facts about Parliament, the building and the history of the place. It took us about two hours to see everything but the time went quickly. Unfortunately one cannot take photographs inside the building but there is plenty of scope outside on the green. Expensive gift shop but excellent cafe for a sit down and coffee after the tour. Well worth the trip!"

We were shown around by our local \"new boy\" MP Sir George Young (London Ealing Acton). Good to see he is still around, and still an MP, he normally sits close to David Cameron on the front benches these days. Yesterday, i made my re visit, on a guided tour (Saturday 27th September 2014). All amazing stuff, and the Commons is so tiny when you get in there! The cafe at the end was very good, and very reasonable prices. Probably the best 2 hour visit one can make, on a short trip to London. 5 star tourist attraction."

The queue was minimal (about 20 minutes) and we went through strict security checks and were given visitor badges.The place is absolutely breathtaking and I went onto a short tour of Westminster Hall, and I also visited the Chapel of St Mary (the crypts) and felt very humbled that this was the place that Margaret Thatcher was laid to rest in state. Got plenty of pictures of Westminster Hall, St Stephen's Hall and the Central Lobby and of course photography was forbidden in the crypts.I spent about over 4 hours in this building alone, just sitting and admiring the magnificent westminster hall and appreciating the paintings and statues in St Stephen's Hall and the Central Lobby. I will definitely recommend visiting this place. I would like to do House of Commons and the House of Lords at some point. I missed the talk about big ben as well which I will try and attend if there is another opportunity next year during Open House.Oh I also visited the jubilee room upstairs!"

I've always wanted to visit the Houses of Parliament but have never found the time so when I saw that Westminster Hall was going to be open to the public free of charge as part of the Open House weekend in London it was an opportunity too good to miss. We had to go through security scanning which I imagine if you're on the usual tour of Parliament and once through I thought we would only be able to go into Westminster Hall. However to our surprise we were allowed as far as the Central Lobby which was lovely to see; the decor of the place took my breath away and it was lovely to be stood there after seeing it on TV so many times. Westminster Hall was breathtaking simply because of it's size, the fact that it's the oldest part of Parliament and so much history has been played out in there. We were about an hour and that was only seeing to two areas so I'd be keen to go back and have a full tour of Parliament and go up the Elizabeth tower."

Given the size of the group, we had a lot of difficulty hearing her. The House of Lords is opulent, as one would expect, I guess. The House of Commons is a lot more understated, but if you know enough about Parliamentary history to fill in the blanks left by the guide, the tour is very good. I'm sure everyone would agree that the process where the Queen address \"her\" parliament is well worth seeing.We have had tea at some very nice places in a London, Parliament is not one of them.

Unfortunately you cannot take cameras inside.

I visited here in late August mainly at the request of my history geek girlfriend (mwah x) and hadn't done a lot of homework beforehand. But as a British citizen and as a reasonably well traveled trip advisor I was really stunned at the history, architecture and the sense of privilege to be in the hallowed halls where so much history has happened. You can choose between guided and audio tours (cheaper option). We chose the guided tour because it was more personal and I believe accesses slightly more of the building. It lasted around 1 hour 45 minutes which was just about long enough. The guide was really entertaining and added another dimension to the experience. This is a working building and so one has to bear in mind that refurbishment and the business of parliament may affect access and the route of the tour. This is where the guided tour is better at adjusting for this. There is a strange juxtaposition of slow moving audio tour people engrossed in their tour, oblivious to others, and the guided walking tour weaving in between these zombie people - quite comical at times!My children (8 and 6) accompanied us because this was part of a big day out in London. I wouldn't recommend it for children of 6, however my 8 year old got a lot more out of it and even asked a question in parliament (and didn't have to pay cash for it - UK joke!).We didn't try the restaurant so you'll have to read other reviews for that aspect. I did try the gift shop which was well stocked with some interesting goods. It's a little small and was quite crowded. I really liked:- the amazing buiding, architecture and aesthetics of the place- the incredible history brought to life by the guide - the guide for his wit and clear sense of pride in his job - the sense of place and privilege - the value for money!I didn't like:There really wasn't much not to like...- having got through security and on arrival in the great hall there was a lack of a sense of arrival and welcome (minor);- I found the rule about not sitting down a little irritating at times. Partly when we were stood in the narrow benches of both houses. Mainly probably because as a UK tax payer I have bought at least one sit on the benches ;0).Overall:I loved the history, I was stunned by the opulence and beauty of the interior, the guide was really entertaining, the value for money and just the sense of having witnessed something very special.I really enjoyed the whole experience and will probably go again - highly recommended!"

It is a place of interest that words really cannot do justice too and gets my vote as one of those places you must visit before you die. Booking online was very easy, with tickets sent by post. When we visited there was no queuing, just the few minutes it takes to go through security, as all tickets have a timed slot.

If you go to the ticket booth now in portcullis house opposite Big Ben you can't book afternoon tea To do both tour and afternoon tea you have to use ticket master I couldn't get it to do both do had to ring and comain and ticket master customer service sorted it out. I probably would have given up if it wasn't for a special occasion Security us tight as you would expect and us airport style so leave time Two types of tours audio do it yourself or guided The extra for the guide is well worth it Almost two hours of wonderful history and in one if the most over the top buildings ever You see both the Lords and the commons debating chambers. Sadly you can't take photos except in a couple of places and they aren't the debating chambers. Given it's on TV and photographed by the press I'm not sure why you can't take photos whilst it's not in sessionGood gift shop and cafe but we went for Afternoon Tea which was lovely and us in a Marque on the Terrace beside the Thames Nice sandwiches scones and clotted cream and cakes with good service and it really made for a memorable visit Desire living in London for years I had never been and it will certainly be a memory for the rest of my life and I can't recommend it enough"

Such history stretching back far beyond the 19th Century period of the current Palace of Westminster. The building is a quite magnificent defiance made even more appealing by the fact that it is a true working environment and not just show.The Guide we had was of quite outstanding quality - deeply knowledgeable, irreverent and philosophical in respect of the political systems past and present!Now for the advance ticketing system. We booked our guided tour well in advance with no problems other than the total lack of instruction or direction about where to collect the tickets from or how to enter the Palace. I researched via the internet a found a few pointers from other disgruntled advance bookers. This didn't help and it was only helpful policemen who put us right!Even when we joined the entrance queue, having finally picked up the tickets,m&e almost missed our allotted tour time as there was no pointer to the fact that the queue contained many who had later tours. We barged to the front and were promptly told that we were late! Hopeless - the staff seeing us in agreed.Fantastic place to visit but the advance ticketing is unbelievably badly organised!"

We did the self guided audio tour & took it at our own pace- listening -to all the bonus extras took a total of 2 hours. I think you could do it in just over an hour if you got on with it & didnt keep sitting down to gaze at the ceilings!Our 2 teenage children liked it as well though maybe they would have preferred the 1 hour version. I would highly recommend though maybe not suitable for younger children although I believe they have a youngsters audio guide available"

The tour was excellent, you had multiple levels to it, where if there was a particular bit you wanted more info for, you could get extended versions of the tour.What is suprising is that most of the building is really not that old (with the exception being Westmister Hall). In fact bits were bombed during the war, but there is still great bits of history there. Definately worth a trip."

The guided tour was lengthy - nearly two hours - with not much chance to sit down (if you need to). However, it is extremely interesting - the only negative was that the tour was 75% in the House of Lords and elsewhere and only 25% in the House of Commons; personally, I would rather have heard much more about the latter and much less about the tiles/paintings/carvings and gilding in the former.

Our alloted guide was an interesting lady who obviously knew her history but she could not compete with the vocal volume of her colleague in the adjacent group (an actor by profession), and also the noise from the building work. We heard only a fraction of her commentary, which I am sure was edited because of her time constraint. We were rushed through each room ending in almost a run through the chambers, side stepping severel other language groups and also individuals doing the audio tour. The whole place seemed chaotic. My advice would be to book out of the main holiday season, probably the first or last group of the day or do the audio tour so you can spend longer admiring the superb interiors of the rooms.

I visited the Parliament in August 2014 and opted for a guided tour as I was certain a human guide was worth the few extra pounds (compared to the price of an audio guide tour) - and I was absolutely right. The guide I had was brilliant, knew everything about the building and the way the Parliament works and he made sure everyone understood what he said. Plus, we were able to go into several rooms which those with an audio guide could only view from the doorstep. The groups are quite small - around 25 people - so there's no pushing to the front rows. Everyone can hear the guide clearly - that is, unless (which was the case during my visit) some parts of the building are under maintenance, which means you occasionally have to ignore the sound of drills.As for the tour itself, it lasts for about 100 minutes and is quite interesting. We went into both the Lords and the Commons Chamber (which, for me, were the highlights of the tour), as well as many other chambers and rooms. The guide explained how the Parliament works, how laws are made, and gave as a mental image of what it's like to be a Member of Parliament. As someone who lives outside the UK and isn't completely familiar with British titles and legal terms, I had some trouble understanding certain things the guide said, but it wasn't a huge problem. By the end of the tour, I understood completely how the Parliament functions. My advice is, don't bring children with you. There were three girls in our group, two of them around 10 years old and one no older than four, who seemed to be quite bored (to be honest, no 10-year-old would like to listen about ministers, bills and voting). However, if you do decide to bring your child along, you are allowed to push them around in a buggy.Be prepared for a 1h 40min walk. There are no toilets and refreshment stops during the tour, only after you've finished it. You are also not allowed to sit in most of the benches and chairs in the building (though they are quite tempting). Come to the tour 20 minutes early, as you will have to go through an airport-like security check, for which you'll have to queue for 10ish minutes. Lastly, photography is forbidden everywhere except for the first hall you step into, so don't bother bringing one of those bigger cameras with you."

But the uber-tour was the \"royalty and splendour in the House of Lords tour\". We were two people. Simply incredible when you see the queues at the sights around. This was more specific and in-depth than the general tour and thanks to the number a really private and memorable affair. Should you decide to bike to the venue, bear in mind that Abingdon Green bike stand tends to be full and the alternative at St John Smith's Square is really none, if you have not tried Storey's Gate in the first place and were successful, you may end up down Millbank close to the Tate Britain and have another ten minutes to walk."

Surely this is factored in when booking?!We'd paid good money for the particular slot that we'd chosen and had other things to do that afternoon so we didn't appreciate not being allowed to go with our requested time slot for the tour.In the slot that we finally were placed into, they were putting people in the following group that were there early into ours, holding up our tour even further. It was also extremely disorganised and very busy whilst going around the tour. We kept having to move out the way, get hurried along by the following tour group etc. It was very cramped.The tour itself was very good and i'm glad we finally got to see it, I loved getting the opportunity to see around the building but the whole experience was actually really poor and I wish we hadn't paid \u00a350 in total for it.

However even before the tour starts you have to pass through security, which adds another 20 minutes. As Parliament was in recess, the builders are in and the place seems a bit of mess outside, as did Westminster Hall.Our tour guide, Janet, was excellent and I could not remember any mistakes. The tour concentrates on the history of the building rather than what happens inside. Ideally I would like to have seen the restaurant and bar, the MP offices, the press gallery and how the building actually works. At \u00a325 it's not cheap, and you cannot take photos other than in two parts. As mentioned above no sitting on the benches in either the Lords or Commons, although you can sit down in the committee rooms and the voting lobby. As tours run every 20 minutes, both in English and various other languages, plus the numerous audio tours the place seemed very crowded, even though parliament was in recess.Overall I got the impression that we were being tolerated, and if every tour sells out that's nearly \u00a380,000 per day from these tours. Someone is making some serious money from this. Came away thinking it was nice, but it would better to see the place in \"action\"."

Towards the end of the tour the guide invited us to sit down on some benches behind the Commons' chamber and a couple of people were still standing so she suggested we sit at a nearby table in green chairs. After a few moments a security guard (the chief judging by his badge) stormed in to our area and shouted at us to get out of the chairs in an aggressive and wholly unprofessional manner. He shouted across the guide and came across to check we hadn't damaged the chairs. He was so rude it was unbelievable and totally humiliating for the tour guide.As a public servant he could do with going on a customer service course and stop being such a jobsworth. Let's face it, the sort of people prepared to spend \u00a325 each on a tour are hardly likely to be people who will damage this property. If I could have caught his name I would be making a formal complaint as this isn't the type of person I want acting as an ambassador for my country to foreign visitors attending my Parliamnat."

My husband and I booked a Saturday Afternoon guided tour of Parliament that was combined with afternoon tea in the Terrace Pavilion overlooking the River Thames. This experience was worth every penny (And trust me, it cost quite a few!), but we would do it again in a heartbeat. Pros:- The guided tour lets guest enter more rooms than the audio tour alone. Not to mention you get to talk to a real live person who can answer any questions you have. - Our guide was very knowledgeable, pleasant, and able to handle our group and our questions quite well. - The tea service was absolutely superb, and the few of the River Thames and London Eye could not be beat.- There are unicorns all over Parliament. I think this is my favorite realization of the day.Cons:- You can't take picture through most of the tour and are not allowed to sit down in many of the rooms. I truly didn't mind either of these issues, but if you are older, this might make the tour hard to endure. Although, we had a few people with canes that put the rest of us young ones to shame with all of the stairs and walking!Tips:- Arrive at least 30-45 minutes early to go through a security screening much like an airport. - Much to our surprise, they did not require an ID, just our already purchased tickets.- Once the tour is over, you are not allowed to re-enter any of the areas outside the main hub, we learned this the hard way (Meaning we received stern looks and were asked to wait in the hub for our afternoon tea).- Guided tours will provide more information and let you see more of the building.- Afternoon tea is worth it. It was vegetarian friendly as well! This must be stated when booking."

Walking through the corridors we passed members of parliament and saw other famous faces. The House of Commons with row upon row of empty seats was eerily quiet - not the normal rowdy room of barracking back bench politicians - the Speakers Chair is a little grander than the others but given the tough job he has, he deserves it. The House of Lords stately and grand in its red livery was also devoid of our landed gentry and token Lords. The Queens robing room etc depicted beautiful pageantry. Whether you are a History buff or Politics fan or both you will enjoy this. The guides are very informative - it is a must to see and experience. Guy Fawkes wasn't a fan and his failed attempt to blow it up and his, to be expected execution, are all mentioned. Centuries of Royalty, Politics, Wars etc, it's all here."

I think it must be me, despite my audio quoting \"Members\" etc. as saying that it was a ' living ' and 'working ' place, and lots of impassioned speeches, it was like wandering around a museum. I could see no sign of the juxtaposition of this palace and today's government. If you go into any ordinary office on the weekend you can see it's being used.The fact that the only people I saw were like me , or security , only added to the strange impression. But do go, l hope your imagination is better than mine.Make sure you look up, these woodworkings and ceilings are simply wonderful, and then, the replacement floor tiles have a short film of today's mastercraftsmen replacing damaged ones, so good that we still enabeling this talent.

You have to pre-book tickets online, for timed visits, as visitor numbers are restricted. You also have to go through stringent security check upon entry.But it is worth it when you get in. You can choose from a self guided audio tour, which we did, or to join a tour. From the lobby areas, the actual house of lords and commons, you get to see all the main areasUnfortunately, you cant take photos one passed the main entrance hall. The audio guide is very detailed and you cant do the tour with out itNice little cafe at end of tour as well"

We would strongly recommend booking a tour.The afternoon tea in the Terrace was very disappointing. The staff were friendly and the venue by the Thames should have been perfect but it was extremely hot in the Marque with fans that did nothing. We thought we would feel indulged and spoilt but just felt hot and fed up. The tea was teabags and we had to share one pot, so those of us having the same type of tea had to pass the pot from one end of a table of 10 to the other! The bread on the sandwiches was dry and there was not a lot on offer. At \u00a327.50 per person we have had much better quality and value at other venues.

Be aware, though, that if you're not a citizen of the UK, you can visit only on Saturdays (though I believe there are additional days later in the summer). I took the self-guided tour, using an audio guide. If you're doing the self-guided tour, the audio guide is essential. There is a pre-set route, and the commentary on the audio guide is very helpful in understanding the significance and history of each room/hall of the Palace of Westminster. I am a political science professor and history buff, so this place was right up my alley. Visitors are given ample time to tour the building, though security guards make sure that folks stick to the route. The rooms on the House of Lords side are more ornate, in particular the Lords chamber itself, which is very familiar to those who've watched the Queen deliver the Government's speech each year opening the new session of Parliament. While the House of Commons is more simply decorated, that body is very fascinating to this student of government. The chamber was badly damaged during the Blitz of WWII, and PM Churchill was responsible for its rebuilding. A large statue of Churchill stands outside the Commons chamber, along with busts and statues of other British PMs. Pay attention to the door to the chamber, which bears the scuff marks caused by Black Rod's annual knock at the door (followed by its slamming in his face).Lots of history here and worth visit of several hours. Be prepared to go through security (about 20 minutes or so) prior to your tour time."

When we arrived there was a huge queue to buy tickets and another queue if you were collecting tickets or paying cash for tickets. Unfortunately his combination meant that we had to wait 25 minutes to collect our tickets which took minutes as there were groups of people trying to negotiate purchasing tickets.

This incredible building sits right by Westminster Abbey on one side and the River Thames on the other. Non-UK visitors are allowed to visit certain days, so be sure to pre-book your tour. It's easy to do and you pick up the tickets right across the street. The history of this place is amazing and the tour guides are very knowledgeable and quite interesting. The House of Lords is quite a contrast to the House of Commons, but both are accessible on the tour. Even if you aren't obsessed with politics, it is still a great experience."

As we had a long coach trip home after the tour we thought it best to go to the loos which were outside the caf\u00e9 area. When we got there all of the loos were out of order. When we tried to go back into the building to use the loos we were told that we couldn't. The security guard was rude and aggressive and not what I would expect after paying a great deal for the tour. He told us that if we wanted to go to the loo we would need to go to the nearest pub!!!!!!!"

As a US citizen, I called the London Embassy about six weeks in advance to ask for \"Cards of Introduction\", which allow admission to the public gallery. They don't guarantee admission at the start of Question Time, however - we arrived an hour early and only barely got in as QT began.

The security was tight, but friendly and we were okay with it. We then went through to the hall, where everyone booked on a tour was milling around with no idea what was going on. I had borrowed a HOP wheelchair, and there was considerable confusion about whether the disabled tour route was available, and whether more than one wheelchair would be allowed per tour party. Well, they changed their minds at least half a dozen times, so the tour times and groups were totally tossed out the window. A simple booking system and a public address system to call people for their tour would be easy to implement and would eliminate so much hassle.The tour itself was fine, and the building spectacular. Now I know that they have to cater to all sorts of people of all education levels, interest in history, ability in English, but it really was a bit dumbed down. The history was not hugely accurate, and the comments on architecture and politics patronising. I am assuming the guides were volunteers?All in all, worth seeing, but don't ask them to organise an event in a brewery!"

Beat the tourist bus loads. Organise some of the sight seeing and then be prepared for the unexpected bureaucratic hurdles. So, armed with our pre-bought entry to the Westminster Palace we found ourselves standing in queues and having to ask; so, how does this work? The English seem not to like having signs to organise people. Very odd considering the numbers they have visit. We managed to negotiate exchanging our print out for a 'real ticket', which was individually addressed and personally handed to us. Sounds good but really the time wasted sorting this out was tiresome. Then to the queue to get through security and then to the Westminster Hall to be collected into a 9.20 tour group (time of our particular tour). However, after that it was a really great experience and the guide we had was excellent. She had a terrific knowledge of the Parliament, the Westminster Palace and the history of both. The self supporting old wooden ceiling of the Westminster Hall simply awesome. So, in spite of the volume of people it was a great experience. Just need to fix up some very silly and time consuming bureaucratic processes."

Our guide was really knowledgeable and entertaining (David). We went in the robing room, Houses of Commons and Lords as well as the different lobbies. It took about 1 hour and 40 minutes. Two things to be mindful of: there are no toilets on the way around so go before the tour starts and you sit down on 2 occasions on the way round so you are on your feet a lot. We both really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone."

I was lucky enough to have a tour of the Houses of Parliament organised by my MP so I did not pay however i do believe that you need to pay for a normal tour. It was the highlight of my visit to London. The buildings are stunning and to see inside of a place you have seen numerous times on television was brilliant. There is sooo much history in every inch of the building from who has been there, the art on the walls, the events that have happened there. After I had toured the building we took tea on the commons terrace the view across the thames was brilliant. Finally I went to the gallery to watch that days debate in the commons and to see the political process close up was fantastic. A must visit for anyone!"

The guide was well informed and answered all our questions. The guide book was an added bonus. Unfortunately the afternoon tea was disappointing. We had quite a long wait before being directed to the garden terrace and then another long wait to be seated. The garden terrace was lovely with a wonderful view. The table setting was lovely. We had to wait 50 mins before being asked if we wanted tea, coffee or an alcoholic drink. After the tea and coffee arrived we waited another 15 mins before our afternoon tea arrived. The sandwiches were OK - two cheese one chicken. One person does not eat cheese but we were not told of the choices. The scone was very good but the small amount of jam and cream was barely enough for two never mind four. The cakes were nice but disappointing - nothing really special. After waiting such a long time our tea got cold. The waiters did not seem to have a system and strolled up and down the room with no urgency or efficiency. On our way out we asked if the delays were due to there being a wedding party but we were informed that there were weddings every week. Our advice is do the excellent tour but go elsewhere for afternoon tea/food."

The building is impressive and so are the contents - Both the Houses and the many statues of our politicians / statesmen - the only down side is the fact you are not allowed to touch anything - and the warnings to the public are many and strong. The building is after all a `working office` a little more consideration to the visitors would be welcome - Although the staff were pleasant enough.All that said a good afternoon out."

We booked the audio tour, it was comprehensive and very interesting, it gave a very good insight of how parliament actually works and how the members have to conform to certain rules and regulations to make it all work and come into place. The building is beautiful inside, the many guides around were very helpful, and doing the audio tour meant we could pause and take as long as we needed to take in the atmosphere and have a good look around. We really enjoyed it. Tickets are purchased in a building over the road from Parliament, we went when they opened and had no trouble at getting in. Despite the huge queues, having a ticket meant it moved along quite reasonably. Wouldn't like to guess what it would be like in the height of summer though, I would imagine it is very popular. At the moment, to book online is through ticketmaster, these are expensive and we were told there was a plan to move away from them as they are not really geared up for the House of Parliament, so if you can get to the ticket office on the day when they open, it is better."

However, I rather wished we had spent the extra $ and joined one of the guided groups, just to get as much of the history as possible.Still, as a self-guided tour with those head-set things, it is pretty darn good. There are many interesting little-known facts here, and you will be a trivia star by the time you leave.Plan to spend about 1 1/2 hours here. And BOOK AHEAD! Also, be sure not to bring in even the most inocuous little pen knife or poky thing. It WILL be taken from you, although unlike airport security, if it isn't a threat to national security it will be returned to you at the end of your visit. Ask me how I know.

The area surrounding the houses of parliament are beautifully constructed, the garden areas are well-kept, and the views are incredible. You can fit a lot into one day by visiting the houses of parliament. My only warning is to beware of the street \"performers\" / people who are dressed up who will approach you unexpectedly and try to get scam you. All in all, well worth the visit. However I would suggest trying to eat in a different location. Food is fairly pricey here."

It is commonly known as 'Westminster'.It is an iconic landmark of London and the UK in general, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city and an emblem of parliamentary democracy.

Upon leaving the Hall photography is forbidden, ascend the staircase, hand in cameras etc before taking a seat in the Stranger`s Gallery to listen and watch debates in the House of Commons albeit behind a huge glass screen with the sound coming via television sets showing the Sky Parliament channel. Really this defeats the sense of being present as you may as well be in your living room at home. I finally walked around the corridors where the tv interviews are usually broadcast from, but overall I felt stifled and let down by the need for intense security - if politicians feel they are so popular why do they operate within a fortress?"

For 14 pounds it is a bargain, however do note that if you are a UK citizen (like me) it is free to tour Parliament through an MP - although you must wait longer. Our tour guide was fantastic, very informative and I even learnt a few things myself. You are taken to every chamber, The House of Lords and The Commons, as well as Victoria Tower to see the Queen's robing room. Others have mentioned there was no mention of Cromwell, out tour guide mentioned the brief republic and its murderous and tyrannical history, which I think some people forget! You also learn a bit of Royal History, for example the robing process and the state opening. The palace is beautifully decorated and houses fantastic royal portraits. The house of Lords is beautiful. My only criticism is that you cannot take any pictures! It annoys me that in all these beautiful buildings, including Westminster Abbey you cannot take your own snaps without flash! Consider supervised photography parliament or introduce a photo permit for the die hard photographers!"

I come from quite a small town in north east England and the police parading up and down the queue with the guns did slightly freak me out.

No queues to get tickets just walk up at your allotted time. We also received a very nice guide book as a souvenir. Our guide, Robina Brown, was very knowledgeable and funny but did get a little snippy when questions were asked. Still she was a very good tour guide. Tour took us behind the scenes to the main rooms of the House of Lords and House of Commons, the special voting rooms etc. We did not get to see the Queens Changing Room since they were getting it ready for her actual opening of Parliament in two weeks. Overall an excellent tour that you will remember. They also had a nice gift shop."

It is a pain to get a tour though, especially if you're not a UK resident. Except for the summer months, it's only open for tours on Saturday. You don't get to see Big Ben. It is also painful to try to find. The ticket office is hidden away down the street and across the road. Google this before showing up there as it is a HUGE building to walk around. Also, don't be shy about asking folks. We got there about noon and the \u00a325 guided tours were all sold out. The audio tour is decent though and takes less than hour once you start. There is full airport style security here. On the Saturday we were here, the whole area was Times Square-like crowded."

Not just the superb building and architecture but the excellent guided tour. The information was given in a lively and interesting way by a young lady who seemed to genuinely enjoy her job. The stories and anecdotes were wonderful and her response to questioning was first rate. The House of Commons, Lords and other rooms and corridors were endlessly fascinating. The tour was free, arranged by contacting our local MP which made it a real bonus. There is a good cafe/ restaurant which was a bonus where you can sit and watch people coming and going. Good idea to combine this with a Big Ben tour - hotels over the bridge - Park Plaza and Premier Inn."

But what takes place is, with all of its problems, one of the great showcases of what democracy can be. The highlight, if you can get tickets for it, is Prime Minister's Question Time, when the prime minister, on a weekly basis, takes questions from members of the House of Commons. With all of the hooting, laughter, and gamesmanship, it is the theatre of democracy at its pinnacle."

The guide was really good, informative & entertaining and I would highly recommend booking the guided tour versus just the audio tour. Allow a bit more time than noted in the website info in case you're needing to be done by a particular time to get to another event, at least 30 minutes extra. Photos only allowed in the first place you enter, Westminster Hall. A small shop in that hall, but a much larger shop across the street, which we missed, so plan on extra time to stop there after if you wish to really shop. Nice little cafe for lunch & they do have scones & tea if you don't want to book the official tea offered on the booking site. Will do again in future with the rest of the family."

To be in this area of Westminster district in London, to see and visit tremendous Westminster Abbey and miss the long range of magnificent historical institutions of Great Britain that along the left shore of the River Thames, was quite impossible. A day or two after viewing the Westminster Abbey, I went to see the enchanting Westminster Palace. This incredible Palace spans throughout the history over thousands years, from the Anglo-Saxons to the present times. All started with King Edward the Confessor when he moved his court to the Palace of Westminster.After this beginning came in 1265 year, the division of the Palace on two houses, i.e. the House of Lords and the House of Commons. The House of Lords met always at the Palace of Westminster while the House of Commons did not have a permanent location. The Westminster is now, the central seat of government, uniting these two Houses at the location, near the shore of Thames. Why this name of Westminster? That was given after the Saxons came on the Britain island from the City of Munster in Germany and mixed with the hosts, the Angles. So, how they headed to the west,the name was simply derived from this fact. However, what we see on this spot, is the splendid kind of gothic architecture, with towers, the high windows, the gates, the frontons, the pinacles, the buttresses walls, the spires, the clocks,the vitrages and beautiful lawns in front of the buildings with the two equestrian monuments of the two greats from the proud Albion history, that are, the Richard the First, the Lion Heart and Sir Olver Cromwell from the reign of the King Charles I. These statues are my favorites among such others You can see within the complex.Unforgettable experience, indeed."

After visiting the House of Parliament, I got it: English history is so tied to Royal history that it s impossible to separate one from the other. Everything that has happened in England has to do with a king's or queen's decision. And even today you can see how the political decisions are made precisely to avoid the queen to have the last word. I learned about the bill of rights, the commons and parliament, and it was actually a lot of fun to watch. If you're in a time or pound constrain, get the audio tour and you can go as quick as you want, but if you can splurge it, the guided tours looked really goo and the guides had a lot of knowledge and personality. Regardless, ask questions to the staff and they'll share a story or two. It was surprisingly, a lot of fun!"

            "review": "A look on the inside. Although I have visited London before, I never got to tour the houses of parliament at Westminster, and have only seen them from outside. This time I decided to take a tour and see how do they look from the inside. There are two types of tours. An audio tour, which is cheaper. You get a device with a tape and headphones and walk there on your own. The second type is the guided tour, which I picked. Our guide was fluent and experienced, and led us through the different parts of Westminster Palace (the actual name of the houses of parliament). The tour lasted about 1.5 hours.I found two cons in this tour. The first is that after the tour is over, you are not allowed to go back and wander the area on your own (like the people on the audio tour), so if you prefer to go at your own pace and linger more you may want to take the audio tour.The second con is the price of the tour, 25 pounds, which I find to be very dear. I have been to other parliaments in the world, and the tour was usually free. In London, they decided to make money out of it, which is a pity.A third con is that if you are not British, you cannot visit the clock tower (big ben). I hope that they will allow foreigners to visit it in the future."

The sheer size and scale of the Hall is impressive and the roof is worth getting neck ache for as you stand and gaze at it seeing different things all the time.The House of Lords is rather opulent and richly decorated, as you might expect and the corridors around it are equally furnished. The red leather benches look quite comfortable, although you are not allowed to try them out!The House of Commons by contrast is perhaps sombre and less vibrant, the benches being green leather. The chambers of both Houses are in fact much smaller than when we see them on TV. This is a great place, and very much worth a visit. Full of stories of national and global importance through the years. It is of great historic significance.Go and see it for yourself."

It was a real treat to be able to enter both the House of Lords and the House of Commons and be in the actual room where the Queen prepares for her annual address. As Americans, we have become accustomed to a lack of access in our own country. We visited the U.S. Capital and weren't allowed in either chamber of Congress, despite it being a weekend when it wasn't in session.Here we actually went right down on the floor and walked in the rows where members of Parliament sit, where they have their spirited and entertaining debates! My 13 year old and 10 year old were not terribly engaged, but our 14 year old son thought it was very interesting, so if you have a tween or teen interested in history, they might really enjoy this.No photos allowed beyond the first entry hall, so be mindful. Book in advance on Ticketmaster and you can select a time of day. This is open Saturdays only, and you cannot climb up the tower where Big Ben is unless you are an EU citizen (bummer). I loved that this was a little of the beaten track of some of the wildly popular attactions like the Eye or Buckingham Palace and seemed filled with people who really have a love of history and government."

Once you're in the viewing gallery, you can stay as long as you like (or as long as it's in session) and watch the process of government in action.

Just west of Westminster Abbey you will see a small three story white building with an address plaque that says Old Palace Yard. There is a locked gate on the left side. The gate will be opened at 8:45 AM. Be there. Walk around the back of the house to one of the three ticket windows and buy your entrance ticket for \u00a316.50. Usually, the guided tours are sold out online in advance. If you have the hard copy confirmation an employee with envelopes will start passing out the prebooked tickets. I didn't prebook the guided tour so I ended up with an audio tour which is quite good. Walk back across Abingdon Street to the big white tent to go through security and enter. Once inside Westminster Hall an audio guide will be issued to you. The Palace of Westminster is jaw dropping. Under the great oak ceiling at Westminster Hall the trials of William Wallace, Thomas More, and Charles l were held. The St Stephen Hall was rebuilt after the fire in the style of the original. The stained glass work is of singular quality. The lobby may be the most beautiful in the world. If the Royal Gallery had existed at the time then Americans would have reconsidered the revolution. The Queen's Robing Room is decorated with friezes of Arthurian legend. The knights of the Round Table on their knees swear oaths to recover the Holy Grail. I stood in the House of Commons on Saturday right where the Prime Minister stands during questions and answers on Wednesday. This was the best two hours ever spent in London. If you visit London then Parliament is open for a tour on Saturdays. Get up early and be there by 8:45 AM. The crowds build quickly. I spent two hours and I could have spent more there was so much to examine."

It has a long and illustrious history - dating back almost 1,000 years in the case of Westminster Hall. We were lucky to be invited to dinner in one if the function rooms, and the building is quite stunning inside, and it is fascinating to see the different parts of the palace. The Houses of Parliament, or Palace of Westminster, may be overlooked by some of the more famous/popular attractions but I can highly recommend a visit."

It is located inside the Palace of Westminister which is also the home of the famous clock \u2013 \u201cBig Ben\u201d (FYI: please note this is a 75 minute walking tour with minimal opportunities to sit down).There is something special about walking through the actual halls of a leading world power government where charismatic and powerful people have walked, sat, debated and forged laws and policies that have impacted millions and millions of people all over our globe.Yes, you\u2019ll see where the famous Prime Ministers have stated their positions and fought for their ideals and what they felt was in the best interest for their country. You\u2019ll learn the history of parliament from your knowledgeable guide as you move through both houses of parliament.Be prepared to have you possessions searched and don\u2019t bring any weapons. Not even a small Swiss army knife (my bad) as it will be detained for you to claim at the end of your tour. Not a major problem, but time consuming. Also FYI, no photos allowed inside parliament, but you might get a photo op of \u201cBig Ben\u201d just after the tour (See my night photo of Big Ben exiting the parliament tour).

We are both really glad that we did, the whole process, from start to finish, was interesting, enjoyable, educational and enlightening. Even the metal detector and frisk search adds to the whole experince and makes you feel that you are being allowed access to something very special and almost secretive. Security procedures over we made our way to the only remaining part of the original Palace of Westminster, namely Westminster Hall. This dates from the 1100's and the thought that you could be walking where kings and queens from the last 900 years may have walked is very sobering, thought provoking awe inspiring. I won't go into detail about the history of the building or describe the sights too vividly as that would spoil it. What I will say is that the whole tour was superb with our guide being incredibly knowledgeable about the subject and very affable. The history is fascinating and we came away educated, entertained and enlightened. For \u00a316-50 each this must be one of the bargain attractions in London. Money very definitely well spent. Tickets are available through Ticketmaster incidentally. Not like the old days when you had to petition your local MP to organise a trip. My only disappointment was not being allowed to sit on the seats in either the House of Lords or the House of Commons. Members only apparently. Don't worry you do get a few chances to sit during the 90 minute tour in the lobbies and some committee rooms. The oppulence, sometimes seemingly out of place, will sometimes take your breath away. Just note how much plainer and less ostentatious the Commons areas are, it tells you everything you need to know about the 'them and us' culture that has dogged our country throughout history."

We arranged the trip by writing to our Local MP who arranged for one of his staff to meet us and show us round personally. As we had arrived early we missed most of the crowds that were visiting in groups later that day. We were lucky enough to see more areas of the building than the tourists and even managed to go on to the famous terrace overlooking the Thames. Our guide Rory was an excellent host and very knowledgable . Other reviews describe the the awesome sights you can view throughout the building. Following a coffee we took our seats in the public gallery to watch the day's business. We were given a schedule of questions that would be discussed and s timetable of the days agenda. It was fascinating listening to the quick fire but orderly debate. Mr Speaker only had to shout order once. I was amazed to see members of the house bobbing up and down trying to attract the speakers gaze.this signifies they wish to speak.We did not watch the whole days events and were free to leave when we wished.A thoroughly wonderful day and even better it was completely free. We used our bus passes to travel around London and there is no charge made when an MP arranges a visit for you.Not sure about disabled facilities and buggy parking so I would ask before the visit if you require these facilities."

It must have been close to 7 pm and we were surprised that it appeared to be easier to get in when the politicians were there, than otherwise. That looked to us as a wonderful proof of real democracy in action. Politicians debate - voters have the right to watch. I should add that we're not even British, but Canadians! We went inside and were able to get access to viewing galleries in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. We could watch the debates. Very civilized. Impressive. Uplifting.

While on our recent visit to London we read in the newspaper that the Houses of Parliament were open for guided tours. Telephone, Ticketmaster, Credit Card and we had obtained the tour tickets. We were advised to be 30 minutes early to get our tickets at the counter and clear security. This security check is like an airport; remove coat, belt, watch etc. the whole rigmarole. However, as long as there are people out there whose goal it is to destroy lives and cultural heritage indiscriminately, I cheerfully went through the check point. After clearing the security check we were led to St. Mary's Chapel. Groups with the different time stamps were formed in this chapel, the only building which survived the fire in 1834. Unfortunately, cameras (and chewing gum) were relegated to the inside pockets, so I can't illustrate my experience with pictures. We had the good fortune to make the tour with an excellent tour guide, by the name of Shaun if I remember correctly; this guide spoke \"the Queens English\" so even as non-native speaker I could understand every word. He was witty and very well informed, so his explanations were very pleasant and instructive and enhanced the tour considerably. We visited the Queen's Robing Room, the House of Lords and the House of Commons. It is really thrilling to be in these places, chock full of tradition. For instance the door between the House of Lords and the House of Commons, which is slammed in the face of the emissary of the House of Lords, when his task is inviting the Commons to the House of Lords for the Queen's Speech, and the indent in the door where he knocks on the door with his baton. Every year the same ritual! One small point of criticism: The groups are a bit close together in the time frame, so overlap can occur when one group is a bit slower than the next group. TripAdvisor friends, I hope I have made you enthusiastic for this tour. If you have the opportunity to obtain tickets, don't miss the occasion. It is worth every penny and then some. At the end of the tour there is a restaurant, where you can get refreshments."

The wonderful Statues and Paintings and the great stories brings history to life. One thing you are NOT allowed to take photos, and even your phones must be switched off (one of our party even got told off for eating sweets!). It is not the eating it is because sticky hands can mark, plus you are not allowed to sit down, so if you have a problems walking, do not go.

Often one of the first images that springs to mind when you think of London, the House of Parliament which rests upon the banks of the River Thames in Westminster. Also referred to as the Palace of Westminster, this is an incredibly popular attraction alongside the Elizabeth Tower and the historic and important Westminster Abbey found just behind the Palace. The House of Parliament was built between 1840-1870 after its predecessor was destroyed by fire in 1834. It is a lovely building, with an elaborate Gothic style exterior and it is a beautiful building to see up close. However, for better pictures, it is best to put a bit of distance between yourself and the Palace. We particularly enjoy views from across the River Thames where you can see the Palace building clearly with the river in the foreground. At dusk, the House of Parliament is lit by floodlights, allowing it to radiate against the skyline. This continues through the night and views of the building are from across the river as well as the entire walk towards across Westminster Bridge as you approach the Palace building. Obviously, views from the London Eye capsules are quite impressive as well. Visits to the Parliament Building can be arranged for overseas visitors on Saturdays and weekdays when Parliament isn't in session. Refer to the Parliament website for details. When visiting, its also worth your time to make a quick visit to Parliament Square, which boasts many statues and monuments to important historic figures. You will also want to visit the impressive Westminster Abbey as well. Collectively, this makes a great way to spend 2-3 hours in London before moving onto other areas."

Go through the royal gallery , view the portrates and statues of past monarchs and prime ministers etc as you wind your way into the central and members lobby. See where all the action and debates take place between politicians and the lords chambers. The tours run throughout the day and if you are going book online it's a lot easy. As stated earlier This tour offers a unique look into 1,000 years of history and is a must."

Went on a guided tour price was \u00a316.50, I gave been to London many times and have walked around the outside of the building many times as well, but this year I decided it was time to go inside and view the interior. The building is simply superb, so hard to believe that most of it only dates from the mid 19th century and the House of Commons itself from the mud 20th century, although of course the original Palace was there much earlier. The guide did seem to be knowledgeable but spent a lot of time explaining how parliament works, which if you are an informed UK citizen you should know already. However I appreciate that the tour has to be pitched at a wide audience some of whom are overseas visitors. Not enough time to look at all of huge artworks, the walls are adorned with so much symbolism. I will definitely be booking again for the tour of the art of the House of Lords. The tour did feel a little rushed to be quite honest. Did catch your guide telling the group that Charles I was beheaded at the Tower of London! I knew this to be untrue and shook my head at him and caught his eye and mouthed \"Whitehall, Banqueting House\" and he quickly corrected himself. Makes me wonder what else he may have said that was incorrect! My husband and I had afternoon tea in the Pugin Room after our your and this was a lovely way to finish off our visit and fave us time to appreciate a little more of this wonderful building. I would recommend that people visit thus wonderful building as what you see on TV does not do it justice."

She explained the history with real enthusiasm and brought the whole pagent alive.Following the foot steps of the queen into the House of Lords and then continuing on into the House of Commons where the queen is not allowed was intriguing.We were told only elected MP's can sit on the Green Benches, so resisted the temptation to break the rules!After seeing both Houses on television it was great to actually be walking along the passages in this truly iconic building."

However, here is what happened the day we went.... We arrived promptly, twenty minutes before our allotted time at 2.15pm as requested. We stood out in the cold miserable weather as the searches were conducted and then were shepherded into the main hall, where we had to wait a further half an hour before the tour started. This already was a problem as we had already been standing motionless for nearly an hour with yet another hour and half tour to come! The second aspect, was, after watching other tour guides, I found our particular tour guide very rude. She talked down to us, we felt like naughty school children, her facial expressions told the story that it was all just too much trouble for her and we were a major inconvenience. Everyone was totally silent on the tour, never daring to ask a question and she even told some people off as they 'stood' in the wrong place! I was so busy trying to follow her barked orders that I didn't concentrate as I should have. I was worried, should my husband fall behind a little, not walking quickly, he would be the next one in the firing line. Having paid an admission fee, I did not expect this sort of behaviour and to be quite honest, it would deter me from recommending the tour in case anyone got this lady. Sad really!"

After all these years of seeing the houses of parliament on the TV, and when you walk around London we finally booked a tour which is on a Saturday as the house is not sitting. We wish we had done it years ago, obviously the security checks are strict to get you in just like traveling on an aeroplane if not more thorough. It puts into perspective all those little pieces you see on the TV. Our guide (Tim) was extremely knowledgeable; it took just over an hour and a half so you need good shoes as sitting is very limited. The tour starts and ends in the great hall where the Queen Mother laid in state. You go into the House of Lords and House of Commons, the pictures and architecture are splendid and the grandeur of the monarch's seat in the House of Lords is breath-taking. Overall a true reflection of countries great political heritage and democratic process. We wish we had booked afternoon tea just to round it off and would do so next time, however we visited the coffee shop and had a small coffee latte for two pounds each and did not think that was too bad, water is available free of charge as are the toilets. Also if you have children you can buy a pencil for 60p so should not break the bank. To ascend the tower where big ben is housed you need to make a prior request to your MP, which we intend to do."

Second, see the despatch table still showing the signs of damage from Churchill's signet ring as his fist hit the table during his speeches in Britain's darkest hours.This outstanding must-see attraction is free, but you must arrange visits through your local MP and you'll need to plan well in advance, but I promise that you'll never forget the time you spent here."

Photographs are only allowed in the first, entrance hall. Tours are about 90 minutes (but also allow time for the security check before your tour ticket time). A cannot recommend this tour enough. You truly feel as if you are in the heart of the British nation. The interiors, particularly those in/around the House of Commons, are a gothic extravaganza.  I took a tour near the end of the day in late January, and would perhaps recommend a tour earlier in the day when there is more light. There are so many details to see, and in the winter's gloom, it's a bit hard to pick as many things out as you might like.At the end of the tour there's a bit of a gift shop where you can get amusing coffee mugs, and also a tea room: tea and a scone for 5 pounds."

The tour takes you to the House of Commons, The House of Lords and the Queens dressing room.The thing that amazed us most was how small the House of Commons is. It really is a fascinating place. We saw quite a few MP's and Peers and if you are in the building at around 11.27am you get to see the procession into the House of Commons when the Mace is taken in. The Speaker of the House is in the procession. If you wish to go on this tour for free you need to book months in advance with your local MP or a member of the Lords.

The security check is however tougher than at any airport, so arrive early to avoid beeing late for your slot time. The building is wonderful, and we had an amazing guide - knowledgable and with a great sense of humor. 75 well spent minutes in London!"

On this occasion I chose to rather see than experience. Myself and my wife are not too particular with tours, and with limited time I knew we could not fit it into our already busy itinerary. If you are similar, don't fret, just being here and admiring the Houses of Parliament is a delight. Yes you've seen it many times on TV, and now you can soak it in that you are actually standing in front of it. Take lots of photos. You are now in London! It's a nice walk to see the architecture, and people watch, and you are close to a lot of other attractions. Take the tube, experience London that way at least. If you have time, and maybe if I ever get to visit again, I'll consider a tour. This is a must if it's your first time in London, and usually you won't miss it because Big Ben and other attractions are around the corner."

It was absolutely superb. It is breathtakingly beautiful inside and I spent much of the tour open mouthed at the sheer beauty and history of the place. It made me feel incredibly proud to be British. The tour guide pitched everything perfectly - informative and interesting yet accessible and humorous. I am so pleased I booked this tour. To find yourself stood where the great and the good (and the not so good) have stood is awe inspiring. Worth every penny for the opportunity to visit this iconic building."

I'm not sure that this is a good tour for children as it lasts about 80 minutes and there is a lot of standing and listening with very strict rules about not touching. Well worth the cost for adults though. Do get there early as security checks took about 15 minutes to get through - the most friendly yet efficient team I have come across though!"

I would highly recommend this to anybody with even a vague interest in Parliament - and I would imagine children (from about 10) would enjoy it too. As you might expect there is quite extensive security, so get there before your tour time to allow for this. The tour passes through the Crown room, and both chambers (we hadn't expected to see the House of Lords from the description, we expected just to see the Commons). Photos are not allowed except for in Westminster Hall (which some visitors might remember from the Queens Jubilee banquet that was on TV). Tour lasts about an hour and 10 mins, and you will be standing most of that time. The shop doesn't sell anything remarkable, and the cafe is no more expensive that you might expect from a visitor attraction in central London."

The only thing is, you have to buy your tickets from a ticket office located in another building nearby. And then, you have to queue and pass an airport-style screening... tours (you must choose one, preferably in your language) begin at Westminster Hall, the oldest part of the palace; make sure you get there at least 20 minutes earlier.This said, our Italian-language guide (Max) was very knowledgeable and seeing the lavish interiors of the palace (among them the House of Lords and the House of Commons) was a great experience. Pity you can't visit the Big Ben, though!"

We had booked on line and arrived at our designated time slot, and passed quickly through security and into Westminster Hall, where our guide greeted us and explained the format for the visit. She was very informative and interesting, and certainly kept everyone (about twenty in our group) fully engaged. The tour takes you through the state rooms and into both the Lords and Commons chambers (no sitting on the benches or banging the despatch box though!!), palces I had only seen on TV before.This was a fascinating and worthwhile visit, very informative, and good value. The guided part of the tour lasts about 75 minutes."

The only drawback was that the hotel we stayed at was in Canary Wharf a 25 minute journey from central London, or so the maps say, but it took us from one to one and a half hours each way for each journey - so if you plan of visiting London to see the sights book a hotel located centrally if possible."

Onlookers are frequently baffled by debates and procedures that sometimes seem to pay little heed to what really goes on outside. The balance between political posturing and the public good is certainly a very fine one here!That said, the seat of British government is nothing if not impressive. The gothic building oozes history, there are statues of famous statesmen, fine stained glass and, of course, the debating chamber itself, with its green leather and wood panelling. The Lords sit to the right of the complex, and everything here is adorned in opulent red.Members of the public can queue up to gain entry, but in my experience the wait can be inordinate and there is no guarantee you will get in to the spectators' gallery. If you want to go, it's probably better to contact your local MP.It is worth the effort, if you can get there."

Stick around long enough to hear the familiar chimes of Big Ben and you will feel the sense of importance and history. The close proximity to other sites such as the London Eye, Westminster Abbey, Downing Street and Horseguards Parade (all within seconds on foot) all add to it and the view from Westminster bridge cant be ignored either. The only downside is the slightly grubby feel to the surrounding footways. I understand how busy it gets and the reasons for the lack of waste bins, but in these modern times I'm sure there is a solution to this"

There are rules and quite strict security to get in, which you would expect at this spectacular place, but it is no worse than at an airport and took only about 5 minutes. All the staff were helpful.You start off in the hall and then proceed on the route taken by the Queen on The State Opening of Parliament to The House of Lords, which is gold and red. Very opulent! Lastly through the central lobby and into The House of Commons. You stand, but not sit in both chambers and everyone wants to. You get taken into a voting chamber and also the robing room. It is a totally fascinating tour and well worth the money. There is a very small shop, prices vary, but you can find something for every pocket from pencils to bone china. There is a tea shop/caf\u00e9 which is good.I would recommend to anyone who is fit. (standing/walking for 65 minutes is not easy) and there are a few stairs to master at the beginning.. The tour is done at pace as there are several groups being shown round at the same time and there is obviously a tight time schedule. Tours are available in all languages by what I heard and there were groups of differing sizes. It would suit a teenager studying History or someone studying Politics, or just anybody who has seen it on the TV and just wants to visit it to see what it is really like."

We'd recommend online booking as soon as possible: in late October there were few vacancies the day before our intended tour. The day we booked there were apparently problems with security systems and we waited well over an hour in the queue until we reached security screening. Security staff were friendly, though, and other staff, equally agreeable, were totally flexible in putting us on the first available tour. The tour itself was fast-paced but excellent. Using only professional guides and having guides develop their own commentary and tailor their talks to their group members certainly paid dividends for me. While my main interest was the extraordinary over-the-top Victorian decoration of most of the rooms that we were led though, I found the guide's commentary was both entertaining and intelligent. While the cost of the tour is quite expensive, I felt that this was money well spent."

If you have never been then this is a must, far more interesting than I thought it would be, far grander and visually impressive inside than I thought it would be as well. What really makes this tour worth doing is the informative tour guides, who from the snippets I heard from other tours as they went round all have slightly different ways of telling their stories and different stories to tell. As we were waiting in Westminster Hall to start the tour, it was very telling to note that every tour that finished was met with a loud round of applause by the group that had just been round. My only regret is that I didn't know about afternoon tea, as we got back to the central lobby, half our group disappeared off to the Pugin room for afternoon tea. Would have booked if I'd known it was an option."

We stand outside the barriers and a police woman asks if we are going in (we had forgotten the public gallery) and reminds us that not only is it our right to go in but its also our duty. So, suitably admonished and with renewed interest, we went in (after airport style security checks and getting a policeman's hands closer than my doctors have ever been !). The inside of Westminster Hall is stunning (its nearly 1000 years old) but just wait till you get as far as Central Lobby - the floors, walls, and ceilings are so impressive.From here we went up to the public gallery to watch the MP's in debate - you are not able to throw anything at them any more or probably even be heard through the thick security glass (which is no bad thing) but to watch and hear your MP in action is fascinating.Moved on to the Lords (strangers gallery) where there is no security glass (maybe the lords are less of a target or maybe less of a loss if targeted!) but the chamber is absolutely spectacular.Anyone with a love of history or politics should visit, it is an experience that I thoroughly recommend, but make an effort to speak to the Doormen (the guys dressed in 'tails'). These are not your average comissionaires (no offence if you are one), but were historically responsible for providing the door security to the king when his parliament travelled. They will provide a lot of info and history that you wont get elsewhere.All in all, a very worth while visit."

As a foreigner, I couldn't print my ticket from home and had to pick it up at the box office. But my ticket was nowhere to be found there and after searching through a big pile of tickets, it had to be reprinted. Then there was a long line for the security check.

Luckily, the guards were very understanding and one of them accompanied me inside, made sure I found my friends and introduced me to the guide. Also, travel light.

I was awestruck that you can go in for free and sit right smack bang in the middle of the seat of power of one of the world's greatest nations and watch democracy being played out in front of your very eyes.A memorable, one-off experience which made me proud (for once) to be British."

This tour was billed to last 30 minutes but as the House of Commons was not sitting and with Frank providing an engaging commentary, 90 minutes passed in a flash. We stood on the Floor of both houses and were struck by the grandeur of the Lords and by the more prosaic Commons. Both chambers are smaller than we envisaged. To stand at both despatch boxes in the Commons as history is succinctly explained is quite something. We finished by passing through the ancient and impressive Westminster Hall This is a must do tour which should not be missed if the opportunity presents itself."

The process is quite easy but obviously must be undertaken a few weeks in advance of a trip. However, it does mean that your visit is free and you are guaranteed entry at the time on the tickets.

We actually contacted the US embassy to get letters of introduction which are supposed to get us to the front of the line. When we got there, no one was waiting, so our letters were unnecessary.

The timber beams are impressive and a must see.For a fee you can also take the guided tour of the whole palace. This tour was a huge let down and the reason I only gave 4 stars, not 5 which the building really deserves. The tour was mainly a lesson on British political history, all good and well but I wanted to hear about the palace and what I was looking at in far more detail. Many things were stated but not explained, such as a MPs calling each other Right Honourable and the mace. The constant use of the phrase \"those of you who are British will probably know this...\" was annoying, as most on the tour were British either that bit of trivia could be skipped and was further proof that the tour attempted to cover more bases than were really possible.Splitting the tours into a British political history tour and a history of the building tour would have been far more enjoyable.But that aside, do at least visit the Hall, a fantastic sight."

So I was overjoyed to find out that tours are now open to everyone. We booked months in advance to be sure we'd have a spot. I was not disappointed. The tour is very fast paced and extremely choreographed to get all the tours moved around the building. That didn't detract at all. The building is gloriously decorated, as my husband said - more of a church than a government building. But here the artwork is of historical figures rather than saints. It was a treat to be in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Now when we see it on TV, we have a better understanding of what is going on. As with Buckingham Palace, this is definitely something visitors to London should see if there when the building is open."

The second time we got in touch with our local MP and he arranged for five of us to do a tour with his researcher. This was brilliant, we spent nearly two hours and we could ask all the questions we wanted. We went into the public gallery after watching the speaker enter the commons and start the session, and this too was fascinating. Anyone who lives in the uk can request a tour from their MP, you just have to write or email them and they will do the rest. Best of all it's free."

It is not intrusive but it is there.And a word to the \"organisers\". This is a classic case of how the British do NOT know how to market a world class product. There is no indication of where to buy tickets, a chance encounter pointed to \"behind that white house over there\". I queued for over an hour in not a long queue so why does it take 10 minutes to sell some tickets in this day and age?? Service was stone age.

Now I get why MPs love their job! It takes about 1 hour and a quarter and there's a fair bit of walking (with no sitting allowed!). Definitely not for younger children (although of course somebody did bring their young daughters - poor things were bored and exhausted). We also splashed out \u00a325 per person for tea in the Pugin room which was a wonderful experience. Not the best afternoon tea in the world but not bad and the service was good. It's a small room and even though it's quite a touristy thing to do it in no way feels tacky or touristy. There is also a caf\u00e9 if you don't want to splash out on the special afternoon tea (which has to be pre-booked - usually a few weeks in advance I think)"

Our lady guide had a good sense of humor and excellent working knowledge of their entire system and this wonderful building. It's a must go, worth every minute and penny you'll spend. On days when tours are run, it's 8;30-4:30, check on line and this is not, as many other things aren't, handicap accessible."

The Houses of Parliament are impressive from the outside, but are even more awesome (awful word I know) inside.BB and I were booked on the 11:00AM tour last Tuesday.It didn't start too well.... Our Chinese friends from over the water were trying to go through the solo turnstiles and revolving doors two at a time at the Cromwell Green entrance to the HP, and got stuck/hurt in the process! Much to the annoyance of some of the persons in our queue, BB and I found it rather amusing. Crazy stuff.The tour itself started and finished in the impressive Westminster Hall which is among the older parts of the building. Our tour guide (a mature, slim, blonde lady) was very informative and pleasant. At times we could hardly hear her (she was quite softly spoken) due to the noise from other tour parties in the background. That is not a crticism of our guide though.The tour itself was marvellous and we were lucky enough to get into the Commons and Lords chambers which weren't in use at that time.We were also shown round many other corridors, chambers and lobbys, all of which contained many great works of art.I'd recommend the tour to anyone who likes history and art."

My only criticism is that you can hear the other tour guides speaking as there are about three groups in each place at once. However the guide was most informative and you could ask as many questions as you wanted. The building is so impressive you don't know where to look first and it is steeped in history. The tour includes both Houses of Parliament, Queens robing room, Royal gallery, Central lobby and St Stephens porch and hall.

Our guide was extremely well versed in his delivery of facts and figures and his delivery was never boring. He explained the difference between the House of Lords and the House of Commons, how bills are presented, voted upon and become laws. The art on the walls, statues, carvings and stained glass windows are simply stunning. Being present in areas where some of the greatest figures throughout history walked was amazing, but to have some of the stories laid out along the way made this particular tour so much richer.

However to step inside The palace and see the fantastic Pugin decoration was amazing. We arranged this tour with the help of our local MP. You need to email or write to him/her and request a free tour of the Palace with dates that you are able to make. They recommend giving four months notice. You can visit in Summer I believe and pay \u00a316.50 which would be something I would be prepared to do in future. Until you see inside you can not believe how wonderful it is. The tour starts in Westminster Hall the largest hammer beam hall in Europe. Lasts approx. 75 minutes. Treat as going through airport security and you will be fine. So do not take your Swiss Army knife etc.. Want to go again and again as it goes so quick. Small caf\u00e9 once inside with regular London prices. Enjoy."

I thought everything needed to be done through a special agency.I was told that it is possible by a friend and since we were due to be in London, thought it would be a worthwhile trip - it was!We booked a pass through our MP which was very straightforward. On arrival, we went through airport style security, just to make sure that we weren't planning to play Guy Fawkes - quite reassuring really - and were directed to Westminster Hall where we awaited our guide. The hall itself is worth a visit, with parts dating back to the 11th Century. Once our guide arrived,we found ourselves in a group of about 15 and were taken on an informative tour of the House of Lords and House of Commons. Unfortunately,photography was not allowed which is a real shame because this must be one of the most beautiful buildings in the country. The pictures hanging on the walls and the murals were simply stunning and should be seen. Having said that, I also quite like the idea of some mystique being in place.If you are a regular shopper in the high street (I'm not) you probably won't mind the trudge, stop, trudge, stop routine of this tour but if you are like me you might find it a bit wearying on your lower back - especially as you are not allowed to sit down anywhere apart from the division room outside of the House of Commons - and then only for a minute whilst the guide gives you more information.This tour is free of charge and is one of the best I can think of in London. It is definitely worthwhile making the effort to book and go along to where your elected representatives make decisions about your life!"

Tour takes you around the building and guides provide facts and history answering any questions you may have. Can be difficult to always hear guide if large group (24) and other groups are behind and in front of you. It's a busy attraction so be prepared and expected. No photography permitted inside except the main hall. But good guide book available from the shop afterwards or collect if you have a pre paid ticket from there as well. Takes in sights of Queens route for state opening from stairs to robing room. Into Lords chamber then through corridors into the different joining area's of the estate. You then enter the commons and see and hear the facts of how it all works. You cannot sit on the chairs on either chamber but the pace is fair so ample time for you. You don't have to know politics, be well educated or think things will be complicated. It's a tour for anyone with an interest in the history, the workings and worth a look. You can get free entry week days via your MP, but I wanted Saturday so had to advance pay, but for the price as things go these days it was fair.Learnt quite a few things and saw this historic site which is an eye opener and I'm no history enthusiast!Makes you think about those from hundreds of years ago who worked there and will continue to do so beyond our life times. Tradition is certainly a strong theme running through this priceless estate.So if your deciding then I would advise go for it! Approx 1.5 to 2 hours visit."

I wasn\u2019t expecting to enjoy this as much as I did, I booked it for my partner who enjoys following politics and we both found it very interesting.The tour is estimated to take 75 minutes and involves a lot of standing and walking, there are very few places or times to sit during the tour and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for people who have difficulty standing/walking for lengths of time.Arrive at least 20 minutes before your tour as the security check to enter is airport style security and can take time.The tour starts in the oldest part of the Parliament buildings \u2013 Westminster Hall \u2013 where groups are arranged into tour groups according to their preferred language, guides are then able to conduct an entire tour in your preferred language rather than having to say things in two different languages.Our \u2018Blue Badge\u2019 guide called Liz was great! She was engaging and knowledgeable and obviously enjoys being a guide. Most of what is seen on the tour was built in the mid 19th Century following a devastating fire in 1834, but the route also incorporates Westminster Hall, begun in 1097 by William Rufus, son of William the Conqueror.The tours start by following the route taken by The Queen at the State Opening of Parliament; from The Queen\u2019s Robing Room, through the Royal Gallery and Prince\u2019s Chamber, into the majestic Lords Chamber. This part is very ornate with much to see and admire, these rooms look more like a royal palace than a government building and they have a lot of interesting features.Tours then move on through Central Lobby, Members\u2019 Lobby and one of the voting lobbies before entering the Commons Chamber, scene of many lively debates.Passing through St Stephen\u2019s Hall, the tours end in 900 year old Westminster Hall, a place where many historic trials have taken place and where Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama have addressed Parliament in more recent years. Lots of the notable events held in this area are detailed on gold plaques in the floor leading up the stairs.The Jubilee Cafe, located next to Westminster Hall, offers a selection of light meals and hot and cold drinks, the cafe was full at the time our tour finished and so we didn\u2019t stop off for a refreshment as we\u2019d have liked. If I were to make a suggestion it would be to have smaller tables and more of them as there were lots of single people or couples taking up tables for much larger parties and we weren\u2019t in the mood to ask if we could share a table.The bathrooms are clean and checked hourly.The souvenir shop is located in Westminster Hall and stocks a range of goods at very reasonable prices, we were expecting to be charged much more for these items.We booked in advance and paid \u00a316.50 per adult for the Saturday and Summer Opening tour of the Houses of Parliament \u2013 this is really great value for all that is included and the length of the tour.We\u2019ll be recommending this tour to anybody with an interest in architecture, politics, royal palaces and/or history, the tour covers so many different topics that there is much to be learnt and it is a really good half day activity."

We went to Parliament on Thursday afternoon and nicely asked if we could walk in on our own. We were, of course, told no ~ Saturdays are the only time tours are permitted inside. I was disappointed and said I'd have to plan my next visit to include a Saturday. To my surprise, the guard asked if we wanted to go to the gallery and observe the House of Commons in session. YES! We had to go through security and were issued visitor tags. We were handed off from one guard to another, never being permitted to be on our own, but in the process we got to walk through Westminster Hall and learn about its history. Then we climbed many flights of stairs before handing over our bags and cameras. Then we entered the viewing gallery. There were only 15-18 members present as summer break began the next day. But this approach could work from Sept. - early July."

Extremely well organised and the time of 1 and 1/4 hours is just right.However the afternoon tea is poor value. You are allocated 2 small rolls, a very small chocolate cake, mouse and just 1 scone. There is no choice. Certainly not worth the \u00a320. There are many better deals around at the top hotels where you can have as much as you want.4 stars for the tour but only 1 for the afternoon tea."

We were very tired and jetlagged but it was excellent and worthwhile to do. Our guide (Suzanna W) was knowledgeable and funny. She was full of anecdotes about the British government and historical figures involved with the Parliament. You get to walk around The House of Lords and the House of Commons, see where they sit and how the entire voting process works. Not to mention, this is my favorite building in London, it's spectacular and the Westminster Hall inside is circa 1000 years old! Most of the castle was destroyed by fire so it was rebuilt in the 1800's. A must see for any visitor of London. It is just very unfortunate that unless you're a UK citizen, you cannot visit Big Ben. It is still very cool to see and photograph from the outside."

She also had a wide breadth of knowledge to share with us and answered a lot of really good questions on the history of the Parliament, the building and politics. It is a simply stunning building. The afternoon tea was completely booked when we wanted to go, so if you know you're going in advance book well ahead of time. You can't take photos for various reasons - security is most certainly one of them. Be ready for walking - maybe avoid booking this if you are not comfortable going at a fast pace or have children that may find a lot of fast walking difficult. So worth the walking!"

The tour starts in Westminster Hall, the oldest part of the building as it was the only room not destroyed by World War II bombings or other incidents, and follows the route taken by the Queen at the State Opening of Parliament, going through each of the primary rooms and including visits to both the Lords Chamber and the Commons Chamber. The tour was brilliant, full of interesting information and anecdotes, including both contemporary relevance, historical information, and architectural and decorative details. Essentially, it covers every topic that could be of interest to those taking the tour, without ever dragging.

The walk to and from the members dining room is quite awesome as one passes so much history recorded in effigies and brass plaques recording serious times in |British history. Time restricts any deep analysis but suffice to say the dinner was excellent as indeed was the selected wine. I did acquire some small souvenirs such as a House of Commons tie, teddy bear key ring, and socks which all bore the House of CVommons logotype and were in a refreshing green. Next time I will hope to have longer to read all the plaques and capture the medieal ambience coming from the great hall, and its corridors of power."

Looking at familiar (to TV news etc that is) rooms was a great surprise, as I really felt that the 2 main chambers, House of Commons and House of Lords were very small. There were some small schoolchildren in our group, and I was very happy to see the guide take particular care of them and explained things to them in a way they could follow.

The guide gave a great balance of the history of the building/statues and important areas and linking this to the current protocols used today by the Queen and MP's. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the tour includes walk through in both chambers of the house. The tour takes you past the Queens entrance to Westminster and robing rooms and into in the house of lords, past the monarchs thrown and the Lords benches seen at the state opening of parliament. Then down to the commons and past the iconic green benches/ dispatch box and speakers chair. The tour allows time to pause in each chambers while the tour guide gives a brief overview about the working of each house and customs in the chamber. Lastly finishing in Westminster hall where you start. The tour flew by and although very busy with simultaneous tours the guides are well practiced at keeping you busy until your time view areas.There were a good mixture of about 20 adults on our tour with different capabilities some with sticks, but the guide was good at accommodating tot their pace without making them feel awkward. There were a number of steps in a different places but your only ever walking for a few minutes before stopping to hear some history and its mainly on 1 level. Your mostly on your feet for an hour so with only one or 2 places to sit briefly but you don't notice.I just wish it was longer. I want to go back and climb big ben."

We took the Houses of Parliament tour on Thursday last and we had an excellent review of the history of the place by our guide Harry.There is one flight of steps out the Great Hall, but there are handrails. It is well worth doing, but please note, officially the tour does not allow anyone to sit down, though most of us did in the Library. It should have take an hour and a quarter but we barely made it out after an hour and a half to have tea in the Pugin Room, which we had previously booked. This was an expensive addition at nearly \u00a320 and hardly enough to fill us. The cafe showed a cream tea at \u00a35 and I think we would take that another time. There were plenty of mementos to buy before leaving."

It lasted for 75 minutes, and be prepared to stand for 90% of the tour. I'd recommend it in a heartbeat, and it kept a 15 year old entertained as wel which was good as there arent many attractions which they are interested in.Do the tour while you can, and be prepared to be pleasantly suprised.

So my advice is don't go with kids. That said, they go free with full paying adults, so that is a bonus.Great to see inside the Lords and Commons Chambers, the lobbies where the statues are and to learn a bit about the building and design of the place.

A friend had let us in on what I believe to be one of London's best kept tourism secrets, so my family and I opted not to do a formal tour of the Houses of Parliament and instead sit in on one of the daily debates going on continuously in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. It was an unexpectedly entertaining experience that I would definitely recommend to anyone remotely interested in politics/government/debate, or even anyone who just wants a good chuckle, as the less formal debates in the House of Commons are quite humorous. Simply going inside the magnificent building is definitely worth the serious security, because admission is free, you can stay as long as you wish, and there is no queue!!"

Had no problem getting it booked but the ticket master website does not explain how to pick the tickets up. It is on site but across the road from the Houses of Parliament. Allow a good 30 minutes to pick them up beforehand. You can print them off but as we don't travel with a printer this wasn't an option for us.The tour itself is very well organised, and it is exciting to be allowed to go into the building. There is a coffee shop on your way in (not the same place they serve afternoon tea) so if you are early you can have a cuppa and a nice slice of cake, the caf\u00e9 was good value. I would not bother with the optional afternoon tea, we walked the 15 mins to Fortnum's afterward and had a fabulous afternoon tea for not much more than the price charged on the tour (everyone we spoke to said the afternoon tea option was very poor value for money).Our tour guide was Penny and whilst she seemed quite knowledgeable, she did waffle on a lot about the architect and the tiling rather than the nitty gritty of the workings of the house and the history. I did overhear several other guides talking with gusto and really wanted to stay and listen to them instead. An example of this was the robing room, whilst we did see the main throne and the fire place she did not mention the three other thrones in the room and walked out before we could even ask what they were, a security guard ushered us out before we could even see them. Security is rife in the building (as you would expect) and one over zealous guide/guard (a middle aged woman) was almost apoplectic when one poor man leaned on a table. She also shooed us off when we stayed for a second to admire one of the portraits that we had not managed to look at when our guide was waffling about the gold leaf.I loved the House of lords and the House of Commons, although you are not allowed to sit down in either room ( I have no idea why, they are sat on every day by a bunch of charlatans and freeloaders and we pay for it!!!!!) Anyway it was nice to see where they have their daily bun fights in the name of democracy.All in all a great hour and half but as I say it is dependant on your guide."

Not really for small children or sullen teenagers, there is also a fair bit of standing and walking and it takes about 90 minutes with no loo stops. No photos and security will take no messing. Other than that it is a very relaxed English experience, complete with queues. There is an excellent Caf\u00e9 for a sit down and coffee afterwards.This is a pure history and high gothic architecture rush. The guides are informative and well versed in the history of the place. You get a full length tour of the best bits of the place and it has a lot to show you. They really spared no expense in its construction. Hand printed wallpaper, gold leaf and lots of pictures. You get to stand in the actual chambers of the Lords and Commons and realise how small both chambers are. The way that UK politics works is explained with humour. Westminster Hall is also a surprise, with its really old history, large size and timber roof. It is best appreciated by brushing up a bit on 19th and 20th Century UK history, but word a look anyway."

We recently visited the Houses of Parliament, not just walking around the outside, we did a tour of the inside of the building which was really very interesting and the building itself is very remarkable!!! The building itself is not as old as we all think it is, the original building was burnt down and rebuilt during early Victorian times, but when you go inside the decoration of the walls and ceilings, the statues and paintings are quite unbelievable to behold. It is well worth the hour to hour and a half to take the tour, look at the inside and learn some of its history. After your tour you can partake of a really good cuppa at the tea rooms with a nice treat to eat before heading back out into the hustle of the crowds on the streets around this attraction. All up well worth the time, effort and few pounds admission to visit."

I must admit I wasn't particularly enthusiastic about my husband's suggestion to do the Houses of Parliament tour but I was really surprised - our tour guide [Jeffrey I think his name was] was knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The tour give incredible access including taking you to the room where the Queen puts on her robe and crown before the State Opening of Parliament, onto the floor of the House of Lords and the House of Commons too. Via some incredibly ornate rooms with lavish decor and historical painting and statues.Our guide explained how power moved from the monarchy to the government and I think I learnt more relevant British history in 1 1/2 hours than I did at my whole time at school [but that was a long time ago... so things may have changed]. It was just really interesting.We went with a 6 and an 8 year old, they just about lasted and perked up when more recognisable figures eg Henry the 8th were mentioned.At the end of the tour is a cafe serving DIVINE cakes - they looked divine and they tasted divine. I would totally recommend the caramel slice - flapjack base, layer of caramel topped with chunks of chocolate, pumpkin seeds and cranberries. It would be worth paying the entrance fee just to eat that again!Disabled Access: I did the tour on my small mobility scooter without any problems. You go through security at the beginning part of which involves having to go through a door, that closes and then the one in front opens which is a bit strange as you are momentarily in a box but so be it, there has to be security into this place! I was then taken by a guide through the accessible entrance that well known disabled political figures such as Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, Baroness Jane Cambell and Dame Anne Begg MP go, and rejoined my tour group at the beginning of the tour. It was quite exciting going through a back way that most people don't get to see.There are accessible toilets near the cafe and all in all access isn't a problem."

(the website gives you an idea of what time the Parliament will be in session on a given day). We spent 2+ hours because we found it so interesting, but even if you only have an hour it is worth a visit (leave 20+ minutes for security and waiting as they stagger visitors in). Visitors go through an extensive series of security screenings (my son's soccer ball was confiscated!), but everyone is helpful and friendly. Visitors sit in the balcony overlooking the proceedings, it is very easy to hear and follow everything going on. The debates were interesting and so entertaining, especially the House of Commons, due to the clever remarks and behavior of the various MPs. The House of Lords is more formal, which is to be expected; we spent most of our time in the House of Commons. We highly recommend this for anyone visiting London, except those with young children."

We were scanned and had our bags x-rayed similar to being at the airport with no queues or fuss. There was a caf\u00e9 and toilets once inside - the toilets were clean! We then entered Westminster Hall which was beautiful. We sat on the benches and waited ten minutes before being called up for our tour. There were 24 people in our group - not too many. A lady checked our tickets before telling us that she wasn't our guide but that she would be taking us to meet him. Our guide was Will Forrester he was fantastic. He was a minute or two later after getting stuck (literally) in a toilet cubicle but came speeding along to meet us in his wheelchair. He assured all visitors that his disability would not change our tour in anyway. He was very knowledgeable and entertaining. Each of the rooms were beautiful with lots of history. Our tour lasted for 80 minutes in total. There is one part where you can sit down for 3 or 4 minutes, other than that, it is mainly walking and standing. Not a problem to us and I had seen this written by others, however, something to bear in mind for small children or people not too steady on their feet for a long time!

You just get a pass from the guard outside, go through security, take a photo and get ushered in. It's the only way that I know of to get inside to take photos (just of interior of building but no cameras are allowed in the area where debate takes place). When the guard was explaining that only people who wanted to listen in should come and not those who only wanted pictures, people walked away. My brother and I were like, duuuuuh, just say you want to listen and STILL take pictures. haha. If you're like us though, and enjoy politics, it will be worth the pics and the debate!"

Everyone very friendly, one of our party was offered a wheelchair which was fab because it's quite a long interesting tour and your not allowed to sit in any room. You can get a real feel of all the history and it's well worth a visit.We booked in for tea in the Pugin room and it was lovely sitting there in a fab room but the tea really wasn't worth twenty pounds a head there wasn't even one slice of bread sandwich wise, just two mouthfuls. The little fancies were very tasty but so small, minuscule. We were pleased we went it's great to see it all in the flesh so to speak, and I have a better understanding of all the jargon, like a three line whip."

Perfect length too. My only gripe is that the afternoon tea in the Pugin Room, although novel, was a little stingy. Only 4 savoury sandwich/rolls between 2 and being only '2 bitesize' each, it was not enough. They all looked interesting too so it would have been nice to try one each. I agree with a previous reviewer too that the waiting staff were not forthcoming in topping up the tea. A few more tea choices would have been good too with Breakfast and Earl Grey being the only non fruit versions on offer. That said, the small tea room has a lovely position overlooking the river and it felt nice having tea in the houses of parliament - not an everyday venue!"

We have visited the Palace of Westminster several years ago, but this year, tea in the Pugin Room was being offered, and we are suckers for tea in different places! The tour guide - Russell Grant, was hilarious; very enthusiastic, very informative and more than a little jingoistic - perfect! I seem to recall we saw more last time e.g. death warrant of Charles 1st, but this was a well executed tour and very well choreographed to allow as many people to visit in smallish groups (about 25) at a time. The acoustics of the building are not that good and you have to listen carefully to hear everything, but it is great nevertheless.The tea was booked for a while after the tour. The Pugin Room is a small enterprise just above the terrace overlooking the Thames. There are about a dozen tables seating 2-4 which can be put together for bigger groups. The linen was white and crisp, the food delicious, but, there was very little of it. There are four types of sandwiches which, as previously mentioned, are more like canap\u00e9s, between two of us i.e. two very small savoury bites each. The small chocolate delice and small lemon meringue \"shot\" are delicious and the scone was fresh and soft, but at \u00a319.95 each, we both felt this was a bit steep. The room is very atmospheric and quite intimate, the staff friendly, but not always attentive in topping up teacups; as there were at least 4 staff for about 24 guests, this really should not have been a problem, but was.Overall, it was a wonderful experience, but not one we would repeat unless the price drops or each person gets one of each of the four sandwiches in future.If you do not book for tea in the Pugin Room, there is a caf\u00e9 just off the main Westminster Hall which anyone visiting can use."

Also, the tour guide was asking the children questions about War of the Roses etc. and seemed surprised that our group couldn't answer his questions.

In many ways there is much to question , and you can understand thinking this is a Westminster Bubble. Although the buildings look old, apart from Westminster Hall, the remainder is in a neo-gothic style and whilst grand in position size and overview- inside it is pretty un-inspiring and without much originality. But dont go for the architecture, go to absorb the history, the speeches the arguments and revolutions. Go to appreciate the characters who have filled these rooms, corridors and lobby areas - who have planned,persuaded,who plotted and made this country what it is today ...........and then,think and have your own thought provoked , about 'what would you do? what would you say?

We took the time to go through security and wait for an opening to go into the Stranger's Gallery and visit the House of Lords for an afternoon questioning session. It was an impressive experience to see the work of this branch of Parliament in session. Enter at the side of Parliament closest to St. Margaret's Chapel (we came at 14:10 p.m. for the opening session at 14:30 p.m.). Visitors are given a card (ours was red for the House of Lords (the House of Commons was not in session that day, but I'm guessing the card to visit them would be green). Each family gets a single card that must be carried with you until it is taken by an official. After getting your card outside, you walk to the entrance where you are let in and get your picture taken for a temporary ID that you wear on a lanyard around your neck. You then go through a metal detector just like you would at the airport. Next you to into a building that leads to the old Church Chapel. After walking through this long, open church that is still used for official receptions, you go up a flight of stairs and turn to the left. It is here that you encounter signs that advise no photography is allowed. You walk down the hall toward benches that are on the right-hand side of the ornate hall where you sit and wait to be ushered into yet another hallway where you sit on another set of benches. Once you are in the first hallway, your wait is probably 30-45 minutes more as there are only approximately 30 visitors allowed in the Stranger's Gallery at a time (you have to wait for prior visitors to leave for space to be opened up for you to be invited in). Once it is your turn to leave the leather benches in the second hallway, you go through a door (same door that we saw many of the official visitors from the government come through that day - those were the same folks we saw being questioned in the House of Lords later once we got into the Stranger's Gallery). Once you get through this door, you are ushered to another smaller hall where a room that looks and functions like a coat-check room is situated. An attendant there relieves you of all of your possessions and gives you a token with a number on it to pick up your possessions once you leave and then you are invited to walk the multiple flights of stairs to get to the Stranger's Gallery. Once you are at the entry to the Stranger's Gallery, a beautifully dressed official in coat and tails shows you in silence to your seat and you look out to see you are in the balcony overlooking the House of Lords (just like you see on CSPAN and the BBC). The gentleman in coat and tails gives each family a small brochure which explains the proceedings, who sits where, the general order of the House of Lords, and there is a monitor which tells you who is speaking. It is most impressive to see government in action and is well worth the wait! If you have any interest in politics, this is the place to visit. On the day we were there, they were discussing an education bill and foreign ownership of England's natural resources. By the way...forgot to mention, there is a sign before you go up the stairs to the Gallery that points toward the Stranger's Gallery (that's how we knew the name as no one ever said this was where we were going to be going)."

The luxury and splendour of the House of Lords, the hallways and rooms leading to the more humble House of Commons, the paintings along the way, the traditions surrounding both Houses--all is worth this tour many times over. Security to enter the building was smooth and quick. Once inside, you wait for your tour (time) to be called in the language of your choosing. You line up and wait for the tour guide to begin.

We were pleasantly surprised that our route took us passed several famous British landmarks including the Houses of Parliament. This is a very majestic complex with lots of activity buzzing around it. It was interesting to see such detail in the architecture, and as is often the case, pictures and movie clips just don\u2019t do it justice. As we were on a fixed budget and had a short amount of time available for our London experience, we did not check into any tours. However, according to another TripAdvisor posting, you might be able to secure some free tickets just by doing some preplanning. Regardless if you decided to tour the grounds, just walking by is an incredible experience that should be a part of any London itinerary."

We weren't able to get into the House of Commons as it was in session, but when I visited in August last time we were able to get in.When the tour is finished you also get the option of going into the House of Commons viewing gallery which was very interesting.

The streets outside are packed with tourists all taking photos of the building, and themselves of course. ( I'm not shy, but I never have really understood how a picture of such an impressive building is improved by having me or anyone else photographed in front of it?)In case people are unaware access to the chamber's public gallery is open to all and entirely free. Why not give it a try? Just ask one of the Police Officers and they will happily direct you.Once through some essential security checks you will find you have free access to the ancient Westminster hall scene of some of the greatest events in British History, Central Lobby, the Public Gallery and the excellent Jubilee Cafe."

If you are visiting London, I would highly recommend to spare an afternoon to visit the Houses of Parliament: it's free and definitely an interesting experience. The Parliament is open most days (check their website for the detailed information) and you can either choose to visit House of Commons or House of Lords. We went there about 2.30 pm. Having read that House of Lords had an architecturally more appealing design, we opted for that. It was a short 30 mins wait before we were admitted into the main room. While you wait in the hallway; glance at the brochure they give you at the door; it sure has simple yet interesting information about the building and its history. The day we were there; the bill that was being discussed was about genetically modified products and it was truly a nice experience to hear the discussions. Once in there you can stay as long as you want. We stayed about half an hour and every member of my family enjoyed the experience."

I know that is a bit over the top but until you have walked the walk around the various Chambers and listened to your guide explaining the strange rules which have developed over hundreds of years in our fight for 'democracy' you will not really understand why we call this The Mother of Parliaments ! (No it is NOT the oldest in the world - that achievement belongs strangely to ICELAND !) But it has set the trend for Parliaments everywhere thanks to the British Empire. Not every country adopts the same layout of course. Back in 1967 I was with some Russians touring there for the first time, one of whom asked the question 'WHAT is opposition !!!?' when we got to the House of Commons ! Do take advantage of the Souvenir shop in Westminster Hall and close by is a very good cafe serving light lunches. It helps if you can get a ticket from your MP beforehand. For visitors from overseas it is one the highlights of their trip. For the rest of us it just makes you proud to be British !! And it costs nothing...ASTROTRAVELCHELTENHAM"

First, I would suggest you check the website to see when they are allowing public tours of the building.We were lucky enough to be in London on a Saturday when they were running them. I bought the tickets on line in advance for a 3:30 tour. They are spaced about 15 minutes apart and if you book in advance, you just pick the time most convenient for you. You can print the tickets out from home. We did it before leaving the U.S.The tickets tell you where to go to enter the building and warn you to be there 20 minutes in advance to go through security. The security was no big deal...at least not nowadays. You get a little white visitor badge to hang around your neck while on the tour.We cleared security and actually joined the next tour going, around 3:15. We had to show our tickets several times and no seemed to care that we were early. I don't think it matters to much since they just call a group of English speakers together until they have the right number and then we were off. Pretty painless with very little waiting around. The tour guide was very good, kind of a Mr. Chips type. The interior of the building is incredible. I had no idea it was so ornate. The tour is conducted as if you were there the day the Queen opens Parliament. It was fun to see the House of Commons after having seen it on TV in America so many times.There are a lot of tours going on at the same time, but they don't interfere with each other. The tour lasts about 90 minutes and there is only one brief chance to sit down...just in case someone has a problem with that.After the tour you can linger in the Great Hall as long as you like. We had a bite to eat in the caf\u00e9 and took pictures of Big Ben from an angle that most people don't see.I highly recommend this tour."

It was more comprehensive than I was expecting and everything was well-organised and timely.The security to get in is similar to going through security at an airport, but without the long delays. Once inside, we joined a queue for our tour time and were let through promptly at 11am. Our tour guide (Victoria) introduced herself and told us a bit about Westminster Hall (where the tour begins). By 11.05, we were leaving the Hall to walk down to the far end of the building where the tour starts at the Sovereign's entrance. You are shown various rooms and are able to enter the chambers of both the house of Lords and the House of commons. As I mentioned, the tour starts at entrance in the Victoria tower and progresses from the House of Lords, through the various lobbies until the House of Commons, which is the last part of the tour. The whole tour took 1 hour and 15 minutes and although it was brisk, it was in now way rushed. Your tour will take place at the same time as a number of other tour groups are happening. This means that in each room you are in, there will probably be at least 3 other groups at the same time, but the rooms are large and by crowding round your guide, you can hear clearly without being distracted by the other groups. Our tour guide was informative and peppered the talks with a mixture of facts and anecdotes. Because of the tight timetable, questions aren't taken on the tour itself, but when the tour ended back in Westminster Hall, she was happy to take any questions that our group had.The tour does not include any committee rooms or any upstairs rooms and you certainly can't wander off anywhere. Unsurprisingly, photography isn't allowed for security reasons (a guy trying to sneak a photo in another group was stopped before he'd even raised the camera) and you cannot sit down anywhere during the duration of the tour. Photos are allowed in Westminster Hall and outside the building both before and after passing security. There are toilets just off Westminster Hall and a fairly nice cafe serving a small variety of food (we had lunch there). The toilets are small and there was a queue of about 10 for the ladies, but they're clean and modern.The shop is disappointing and the quality and range of the souvenirs leaves a lot to be desired. There are a number of free leaflets about the building and the working of Parliament and some of these are available in other languages. Two other tours set off just before we did and one was a Japanese language tour and another a German tour, so these tours are also available in other languages."

This takes up a total of about an hour, maybe less depending on the lines and how long you decide to stay at each House. I wouldn't recommend going with babies or toddlers though - people are supposed to keep quiet while Parliament is in session."

Once there you'll be given a ticket for the House of Commons. We spent 20 minutes watching the debate before changing to the House of Lords. You have to ask one of the guards for a new ticket to visit the House of Lords, because they take your ticket. You aren't allowed to take any bags, cameras, or phones in either chamber. I prefered the House of Lords, the chamber is must more ornate and decorated. Although the debate in the House of Commons was much more lively. One final note, as you're entering (or exiting) the hall there is an awesome opportunity to have your picture made with Big Ben. Right before you enter the building, turn around. There are usually few people around and, if the light is right, it makes for a great picture."

            "review": "Fantastic. I had wanted to do the tour of The Houses of Parliament for a while but had never been able to get tickets to correspond with trips to London before. About four days before our most recent visit I happened to see an article about a new opportunity to take tea in the Pugin Room (when booked with a tour of the Palace of Westminster). It had to be booked through Ticketmaster and by phone so I was doubtful of being lucky, especially as it was the first day it was available. We were successful and it was all handled really efficiently. We collected the tickets from the Ticket Office on the day, just across the road and again it was a speedy process with no waiting. The tours themselves are a little like being on a conveyor belt as they run so many during the day, and several in parallel, and there is a clear need to keep to time so groups don't back up. However, leaving that aside the actual tour was great and our guide very good. The building and its contents have a real wow factor and you really get to see all those areas we've become familiar with seeing on tv, plus lots of behind the scene rooms and corridors. The sense of history is terrific as you follow in the footsteps of Kings and Queens and Statesmen (although much of what you see is relatively recent in terms of our history having been rebuilt after a massive fire). As you pass through The Lords and The Commons you realise how much you didn't know about our heritage and parliamentary processes (plus an awful lot you did). In that sense I think overseas visitors will possibly take away a slightly different experience than a British visitor because it's so much more personal to us. As regards the afternoon tea this was perfect, after we'd been walking for around 80 minutes, so it was great just to sit down in comfy chairs. The tea was delicious and exactly as described by another reviewer, in some detail, so I won't repeat. The Pugin Room is quite small so there are limited numbers for this add-on to the formal tour but it was well worth the cost as we're unlikely to come again and a lovely way to round off a brilliant afternoon."

As there were a number of tours circulating at the same time it was necessary to keep moving, but I did not feel rushed or short-changed, and all our questions were answered. Some reviewers have complained that we could not sit in either of the chambers, it would have been better if we had been told why not, for myself I presumed it was a security thing, rather than an objection to us plebs dirtying the seats.

As a UK citizen, I could have done it for free during the week, but couldn't get time off work so chose to pay to do the tour via Ticketmaster . As I wanted to include the Afternoon Tea option in the Pugin Room at the Houses of Parliament I had to make the booking over the phone via Ticketmaster. It is still well worth the money and it's convenient to book it via Ticketmaster in advance as you pay in advance and then just collect the tickets on the day from the box office at the Houses of Parliament. I only had to queue up for approx 1 minute at the box office before I had my tickets.The Cost to do the tour and afternoon tea afterwards is \u00a336.45. The afternoon tea is new, only recently introduced and currently you can only do the afternoon tea if you are booked onto a tour. However, one of the guys there mentioned that possibly from next year, you will be able to book afternoon tea in the Pugin room without having to do a tour first.The tour is excellent. Whichever guide you get is very informative and knowledgeable. Tour lasts an hour and a quarter and you get to see and learn a lot. You can use your camera in the Westminster Hall and the Pugin Room (where you take afternoon tea)The afternoon tea was lovely. The sandwiches were small in size (each one was slightly bigger than a canape) but they were sufficient. The sandwiches were: Ham with chilli jam; smoked salmon and cream cheese; and chicken, with peppers and avocade guacamole. The vegetarian option looked good also. The sweets consisted of sultana scones with jam and clotted cream; valrhona chocolate delice and a lemon meringue shot. You had plenty of top-ups of tea and coffee throughout the service. You could purchase champagne by the glass (or other alcoholic beverages) to accompany the afternoon tea if you so wished. Although it did not look like a lot of food, it was beautiful ly presented and actually very filling. The Pugin Room itself is stunning as are the views from the window.I would highly recommend doing the tour and afternoon tea."

This was by far the best of many attractions I visited on a recent trip to London.A guide takes you round in a group on a tour of the most spectacular of the Palace of Westminster's rooms. The tour was thoroughly engaging from start to finish, with a very knowledgeable guide who not only told us all about the history of the building but lots of little anecdotes about certain traditions that exist concerning law-making and state events, and painting a very vivid picture of the famous ministers and prime ministers that have walked the halls.The real highlight is visiting the House of Lords and the House of Commons and hearing about the ritual of the State Opening of Parliament, and how parliament has evolved over the centuries.It was excellent so there are only minor criticisms where there's room for improvement:- The first half of the tour is about the State Opening of Parliament, although to be honest at times it felt like the whole history of the British royal family, describing portraits one by one and giving general information about the monarch. I would have preferred, for instance, to have heard more about law-making and MPs than a backstory of Henry VIII and his six wives in one of the lobbies because their portraits were there.- The tour was great and the guide knowledgeable, however there are usually at least one or two other tours (in foreign languages) going on in the same room. It was just about bearable but a bit annoying as it was distracting.- A bit too much time was spent on the state opening of parliament, although I suppose it's because the Lords is done first. It would have been more logical to follow a bill's life through parliament and start with the Commons- For some unfathomable reason, you're not allowed to sit down on the benches in the House of Lords/Commons, despite the fact that the group stands up in front of them and is told specifically not to sit down!But all in all, an excellent tour, and I'd highly recommend it."

Well worth a visit.Any visitors, not so familiar with British history may gain from a quick review of Wikipedia, as our guide sometimes made comments that might seem obscure e.g. pointing out the painitings as \"Divorced,Beheaded, Died\" without introducing Henry Viii first, e.g. talking about Prince Albert without mentioning Queen Victoria first, e.g. \"suffrage\" might be better explained as the \"right to vote\".

Tour started in Westminster Hall and lasted about 75mins, best part was the House of Commons where you are allowed to stand in the MP's seating area but def not allowed to sit on the MP's seats. Luckily for us a live debate was happening on a Friday in the House of Lords so no tour of that house but we could get access to the viewing areas and watch - good experience.Only allowed to take photo's in Westminster Hall. Gift shop is good, lots of House of Parliament tat. Try to send a postcard from the onsite Post Office if you can.Well worth a visit if you can and next time we will book the Big Ben tour, via MP of course."

Through the kind courtesy of our MP we enjoyed a tour of the Palace of Westminster on the occasion of a family birthday. Entry and security were efficiently executed and we were amazed at the number of tours that were to take place that morning. However, they were so well planned and timed that you never felt crowded. Our guide was informative and efficient, with a sense of humour too! Whereas the original Westminster Palace was the home of Kings and Queens, its present purpose is the root of our Government and the politics that encompasses. Statues and busts of past Prime Ministers are a reminder of the history of our times, with Churchill in a typical pose and Mrs Thatcher looking rather scary! The House of Commons and House of Lords, with its opulent gold thrones, brought the world of government to life for us and, along with all the processes that were fully explained by the guide with MPs going about their business in various areas of the Palace, this gave a real insight to the manner in which our country is governed. We also came away with the intention of checking that our MP is pursuing issues, and voting, in the manner his constituents desire!  This is a tour not to be missed if you have the chance. We will be applying to attend a debate and Prime Ministers Question Time in the future.Should you want to include a tour in a day of visiting other attractions in and around Westminster there is a reasonably priced car park (Q Park Westminster) virtually opposite where you can pre-book and pre-pay for a space. Then its just a 2 minute walk!"

We did not want it to end! Our guide was great--unfortunately I do not remember his name. He laid out the system of government simply and quickly. We learned about politics, architecture and history and were completely entertained the entire time. Reluctant daughter LOVED it. The tours are advertised as being led by highly qualified and knowledgeable \"Blue Badge\" tour guides. Ours certainly was. It was worth the money.We did not have advanced tickets and I feel we were lucky to get them on the same day. We arrived at the ticket office shortly after they opened. They were sold out for morning tours so we asked for the last tour of the day and were able to do that. So, I would recommend obtaining your tickets in advance if you can. You can purchase them through Ticketmaster on the Houses of Parliament website. When I arrived to purchase tickets, there was a person standing outside of the ticket office handing out pre-purchased tickets.I don't think young children would enjoy it."

You are ushered through the rooms by a guide who, unfortunately, does not have time to answer questions during the tour but imparts a great deal of very interesting information on the history, art work, architecture and procedures of the parliamentary chambers throughout the walk. It can be quite manic with 4 or 5 other tour groups in the same room at one time, but don't let that put you off, there's is so much for the eye to feast on, you become oblivious to anyone else around. The chambers we visited were spectacular, with their sumptuous colours and amazingly detailed carvings. It would have been wonderful to have been able to linger in each room to try to take in all there was to see. In fact if you were to visit a number of times, I'm sure you would still see & learn things you missed the first time. What initially instigated our interest was the opportunity to see the 1000+ year old Westminster Hall. We were not dissappointed, but we were equally blown away by the rest of the tour, which we did not expect. You are able to wander around Westminster Hall at your leisure once the tour concludes. We booked our tickets through British Ticketmaster before we left Australia, which was ok. The cost, \u00a316.50, was money well spent, as I think you would be hard-pressed to find anything quite like this elsewhere in the world."

We were ushered through the security which was swift and fast. As we obviously missed our group, we were politely asked to wait for few minutes and then joined the next tour. Our guide was a fantastic, extremely knowledgable lady, who obviously enjoyed her job. We were taken through the whole palace, stopping in the right places, where we were given information with interest and wit and occasional and very appropriate joke. We were kindly guided through the centuries of English history with explanations for both British and non-British visitors. There was not one minute I felt bored or overwhelmed with information. I was in complete awe of this beautiful building which still has contemporary function and serves as working place for tens of thousands of people every single day.

Since it is still being used as a House of Parliament in a country with a living dynasty, and the fact that it is still a place to meet foreign gov officials, to discuss world politics and make public speeches.... It is an old yet living building, not just a lifeless museum. For that reason, I think it is much more interesting than some palace converted museums in nearby country no longer has King and Queen (I don't want to name it here), which everyone is raving about.

Intricacy is really the word that encapsulates the feel of this vast complex tune of a building. Monet the French Impressionist selected this feature of London perhaps for some of his most evocative paintings well worth seeing in the National Gallery a nice walk away from this tourist feature that actually deserves a good long look."

We are a family of four (2 x boys 7 and 11) and we booked for free through our local MP.When we arrived we fast tracked the long queue of tourists waiting to pay (which was nice as we already had tickets). Our guide though was very nice and extremely knowledgeable was a little too quietly spoken whereas some of the other guides were too loud so it was a little difficult at times to hear what he was saying.Wesminster Hall is enormous and you could easily imagine the feasts that took place there.The first thing that strikes you is how small the House of Commons is. Apparently EVERYONE says that! Although we weren't allowed to actually sit on the benches, we did stand behind them. We were given a few funny facts about the Speaker's chair.The House of Lords looks much the same but is obviously red rather than green. Then there's the central lobby where we saw all the MP's pigeon holes (Hello Mr Brake!) and there is a post office there. The central lobby separates HoC and HoL and is where you normally see news presenters doing their piece to camera.Then there's the rest of the place which is vast. We saw the Queen's changing room and other various halls and corridors displaying marble busts, paintings and other items of military or historical interest including the Magna Carta. There are heads of previous Prime Ministers and there was one empty plinth. The guide said that it would probably be used for Margaret Thatcher when she eventually passed away and by the afternoon (at the top of Big Ben) we were given the news that she had.Book this along with the Big Ben tour for a great day out."

Big Ben is actually the Clock Tower and you used to be able to go up that, but I am not sure now. Wrap up well and take earplugs of you do. All in all an experience not to be missed!"

We visited with our 17 and 12 year old daughters and they both thoroughly enjoyed it, which meant the tour guide managed to aim the content of the tour from adults through to a 12 year old. We managed to see the House of Lords and the House of Commons as it was during the Easter holiday along with lots of other areas of Parliament, but I understand if the Houses are sitting this is omitted from the tour."

The tour lasts about 90 minutes and is really interesting with a look at the House of Lords, House of Commons, Lobby and Great Hall - lots of background information and even if you have no interest in politics, there is a mass of information and it is always great seeing the bits you usually only see on the television. There was a reasonably priced caf\u00e9 with some fantastic muffins and you have plenty of time after the tour to wander in the Great Hall and around the precincts. No photography is allowed in the main part of the tour, understandably so, and our guide was a little officious in keeping everyone together, but all the other staff were informative and ready to stop and chat, to make sure you had all the information you needed and answer any questions. Once the tour was over there was no time limit on you. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is visiting London - not ideal for very young children."

As a UK resident I had to contact my local M.P who kindly arranged and posted tickets to me. Admittedly it took a bit of planning in advance, but worth it, if from abroad ticket details are available on the Houses of Parliment website.You are advised to get there early so as to get through security, once this is done you wait in Westminster hall. We were met by our tour guide and taken through the House of Lords and the Commons via the Queen's robing room and Member's lobby . The feeling of history and splendour were complimented by our informative and friendly tour guide. Normally a tour would last for approx 75 minutes, there are some opportunities to sit, but not many. There is a cafe (expensive) at the start with toilets. Our tour went considerably over time and the two young children in the tour were getting restless and a few people were struggling a bit towards the end.I was really impressed with the tour and would certainly recommend.There was a lady in our group in a wheelchair who was able to access all areas albeit via different routes sometimes to the main group, this did not present a huge problem."

I'd expected a \"whistle stop\" tour where you didn't get to see that much but in fact it was quite a leisurely walk through with an interesting guide and the chance to not only see but to be \"in\" the Queen's Robing Room, Lords and Commons chambers, Member's lobby and a voting lobby etc.Anyone with any interest in our historic buildings or institutions should have this site on their \"to do\" list. The tour is 75 minutes but with security etc you need to allow an hour and a half plus after the tour you can spend some time on your own in Westminster Hall.The ticket price, to me, seemed pricey before entering but by the end of the tour that thought had turned to \"well worth the admission fee\"For most of the year you can only tour the Houses of Parliament on Saturdays other than arranging a \"private\" view with your MP. Summer openings allow visits between Tuesday and Saturday from 9.15am - 4.30pm during the following dates: Between 31st July and 31st August and also between 17th September and 5th October."

This makes Politics and Parliament real...even if you can't stand politics and claim to be totally bored by it all, I challenge you not to get something from the tour. Cheap to do ...about \u00a312.50 less for students etc and lasts about 90 minutes. For this you'll walk through the House of Lords, yes around those red benches and then through the House of Commons...the famous green benches. You'll learn about the history of the building and some of the Queens role in the state opening of parliament. You'll see where she sits in the House of Lords amidst the gold and splendour and you'll find yourself in areas where you wouldn't ever have been expected to have been allowed ... you'll get used to security! Groups are of 25, works well, and with a very knowledgeable and enthusiast tour guide, you cant fail to find something of interest. Liz you made the visit such fun...bossy,( your words!) but really great fun. Can't thank you enough ... Looking forward to watching the state opening next month to relive the experience! Not English speaking? Website good for more information, yes your MP can take you for free but it's their work place, Tour guides give an all round non bias account. Recommend this especially for family...good history lesson, so take the kids!"

It annoys the French, the Germans, and the Spaniards!))d) Architectural history through the Baroque styling of the stonework, it is simply stunning.e) An overview of how the Lords and the Commons work. Be prepared to be stunned how small both these seating areas are.Don't EVER, EVER, sit down unless explicitly told to do so. (This happens only once in the lobby at the commons.) One lad of about 12 years old got the shock of his life when he was barked at quite sharply by an armed officer to \"DON'T SIT DOWN!\".

To see where legendary MPs and PMs have stood and given some of the most emotive speeches in our country's history. I also stood in the Great Westminster Hall, nearly 50 years after being there when Winston Churchill laid in state. The queue had begun at Blackfriars Bridge and this was before people went to great state occasions to be 'part of history' or for an amusing day out.To see the voting lobbies and the gold plated luxury of the Lord's as well as seeing where MPs are lobbied in the public area was fantastic for someone like me enthralled by the political world.Even if you are not interested in politics, go and see where some of the greatest decisions are made, you should not be disappointed.

We waited in Westminster Hall for our guide, in a small party of about 20, All tours were carefully arranged so as not to overlap or crowd one another. Our guide was exemplary, a London Blue Guide, who explained the history and business of Parliament very clearly. There was no rushing and no confusion. We saw both the House of Lords and the House of Commons, and were allowed to sit down in the lobbies. There is a small souvenir shop towards the end of the tour and a cafe to the side of Westminster Hall. The tour takes an hour and a quarter but seemed much less as it was so fascinating. I learned a lot and have felt more impressed with the process of government since. This is not a tour for children, but ideal for anyone with a real interest in British history. Altogether, a unforgettable day out."

They are interesting but you feel like you want to know more and the explanations are very brief.But not long ago I had the chance to visit it whit an MP as the guide, and the experience was fabulous. He knew so many secrets of the place and told us interesting and funny stories of the people who has worked and works there now.

Although a friendly and enthusiastic lady (with 26 years experience) she spent the first 15 of our 75 precious minutes laboriously telling us what we were about to see ... When we eventually started to explore the Lords' chambers, the severe shortcomings in her 'style' began to stick out like a duck-house on a peer's lake. I would charitably describe her technique as 'talking to 10 year-old Americans'. In the magnificent Royal Robing Room, we were given a potted history of Victoria and Albert from the perspective of those famous historians Mills and Boon. While Lord Nelson was apparently 'a very nice man', which was said in such a lovely Caribbean accent, it was hard to get annoyed. Unfortunately, my fellow 5th-graders were starting to chafe, especially the Scottish couple who were forced to educate our guide on the origins of James the First (James VI of Scotland). And I didn't know that the sovereign could re-write whole portions of The Queen's Speech according to her whim. NO!!! It took every ounce of my strength not to tell our guide just how silly that was, especially when we had just seen King Charles' death warrant - I still don't know if that was a facsimile or the original. I could go on and on ... but I wont.Magnificent surroundings but mangled history!OK, so she got us tickets to see a live debate after the Commons Chamber was unexpectedly invaded by MPs - so thanks for that.

The tour was incredibly entertaining and educating. The only bad thing about it is that you are not allowed to take pictures aside from within the Westminster Hall. The tour guide was really knowledgeable. The tour started by following the path the Queen takes when she opens the Parliament. I think the best part of this tour is the part where you are taken inside the Houses of Lords and Commons. I never imagined being inside these rooms that I only have seen on TV.

Its always well kept and very much an attraction especially when you come out of the tube station."

It was free for us byt I don't know if there is a charge for non UK residents.The guide gave our group of about 14 a very informative talk with stops to listen all around the buildings. It takes 75 mins and we did whizz along which was fine for us but 2 elderly folk struggled to keep up.We went in at 16:00 on a Friday so no MP's around but because they had gone home we could go right inside and stand in seat area - you must not sit down on the seats!!Enjoyed the tour and learnt lots of things I didn't know about how we can access Parliament."

Despite not being particularly interested in politics per se; I found the tour absolutely fascinating. The guide was very knowledgeable, and imparted the information in a fun way, involving everyone including the kids. It was a fairly large group, so at times it could be difficult to hear, especially as tours depart every five minutes or so, so each room can have more than one group present with two or three guides fighting for attention. The building itself was elegant and much more opulent that I expected - gilded pillars, carved furniture and painted ceilings. So much to see, I would love to go back again to pick up on the bits I missed. Security is strict, obviously, and mobile phones and cameras are not allowed to be used inside (other than in Westminster Hall), but there is a shop at the end of the tour where you can buy post cards and small pamphlets describing what you've seen.You must bring two forms of ID with you - one with a photograph and one with your address. They do check this against the list of participants. It is really worth doing, and I was pleased to see several visitors in wheelchairs - most of the building is accessible."

If you are going to get in touch with your MP, and want to visit when Parliament is in session, see if he/she can get you a place in the public gallery for Prime Minister's Questions on a Wednesday - it's great fun spotting faces from above and watching the sparring!"

Our guide Bodo? a German gentleman put my knowledge to shame he was excellent. The tour took approximately 75 mins and included the House of Commons & the House of Lords. We knew this prior to arriving, but what I didn't realise was that we would be stood exactly were the PM and our MP's stand, and were the Lords sit. There is so much information but we highly recommend a visit. Even our daughter who is 9 thought it was the best bit of our trip which amazed us especially after seeing Shrek!"

The guide welcomed every visitor personally, asking where we were all from etc. She also answered every question given in great detail and without any hesitation.I had visited before many years ago but I once again loved the wealth of information and fantastic interior around. The building is as impressive inside as it is outside, and I certainly recommend the houses of parliament to all. After the tour, we visited the cafe which was reasonably pricedThe next time I visit the capital, I will try and venture into the public gallery."

Non-citizens have very limited access to Parliament but there is a pre-scheduled Saturday tour. The guide instructed on the workings of Parliament at each junction throughout the tour. She provided insight into how the current process came into use, both procedural and legal, and instructed on the political history of the UK. On the tour we were able to go into chambers, stand/sit on the benches, stand at the speakers podium and much more. Not only is the architecture magnificent but the tour was very insightful."

The length of the tour can vary a bit depending on the enthusiasm of the guide and the guided. Ours was nearly two and a half hours, with only one brief opportunity to sit down!Absolutely fascinating in all respects and some of the interiors are gloriously over the top in color and gilding. Every corner having something of historic interest.The tours are accessible, with some restrictions, to wheel chairs, but it is not a tour for those who cannot walk a long distance without resting, as ther is little opportunity to rest.Small and unique gift shop of quality items including \"Mr Speaker's Whisky\".

They will also take a picture of you that you must wear while you are in the facility.Try to get a docent tour--they are also given is various languages by a very knowledgeable person who will seek answers to questions that she may not be sure of.

I was here in June this year but like most tourists, marvelled at the architecture of the building from the outside, only took pictures with the building behind me. This time, I decided to book the guided tour and see what it is like on the inside and was not disappointed in the least. I booked the tour over the phone the day before and it costs only 15 pounds. Was late with the picking up of the tix but was allowed to join the later one. Thought that was very accommodating of them. What was interesting about where the Houses of Parliament are located, is that they are located in a once functioning palace. Our tour was a little more than 75 minutes long and throughout I learnt about the history of how the Houses of Parliament came to be, some British history, visited the House of Lords, House of Commons, viewed the frescos and artwork that adorn the place. It was truly a wonderful learning experience and it helped that our guide, Susan, was so knowledgeable and had a wicked sense of humour. Loved how she told the jokes and kept a straight face. I arrived when there was daylight and left the building after the sun has set and was greeted by a beautiful sight of a huge lighted Christmas tree and the beautifully-lit Westminster Palace. A tour not to be missed."

The history is amazing from the nearly thousand year old Westminter Hall where Monarchs lie in state and where world leaders like President Obama address both Houses of Parliament and the Queen in her Diamond year did most recently. The main Palace is the rebuild following the fire of 1842 when the design competition was won by Sir Charles Barry with Augustus Pugin the champion of the Gothic revival,if you are into design this is a fascinating visit. As for the less accessible parts of the Palace the view from the Terrace is legendary but you have to get a Member to invite you to see it,and the remarkable crypt beneath Westminster Hall where the famous cupboard exists where the suffragette Emily Wilding Davison hid on The night of the census in 1901, again only with a Member. So much to see in the Palace of Westminster and there is still the Royal route, the two debating chambers the drama of Question Time.This is a place you can come so many times and learn something new every time."

Alas, cameras / mobiles were allowed into the building and its tour, but sadly, you are strictly forbidden from taking any photos.The tour lasted for about one hour and this may be of concern to some, that you are also strictly prevented from sitting down anywhere, until the tour has finished and you are back in the main hall.Many ThanksGary\u2026Improve vacation\u2026"

It was very enjoyable to see how these institutions worked after we had seen our American counterparts do their things. We visited both houses and were able to listen to debates going on in both sides during our visit. Even our 19 year old found it interesting (although she probably wouldn't do it again). It was one of our holiday things we did for my husband."

I think you can only do this particular tour on a weekend and a bank holiday, so certainly worth booking in advance. We paid \u00a315 for an adult ticket.Arrive a little ahead of your allocated time slot, as you will need to go through security, similar as if you were in an airport.We were in a tour of aprox 25 people and the person escorting us round certainly knew her stuff, very experience and made it very interesting. We took our 7 year old daughter, who found it a little long and I although the guide tried to include her, the information being given was hard for her to understand and grasp. I would say this is probably more suitable for older children and adults.Overall we found it a very interesting hour and 15 minutes and have come away with a far better understanding of what goes on within Parliment."

We saw a line of people qued up to get in to the Parliament. We approched the young man and asked him how you could obtain entry. It was a Friday just after noon. He said that the budget was just being finalized and there would be a Saturday session and if we arrrived for 9:00 a.m. we would be able to get in. After some pretty serious security checks, we were admitted to the chamber gallery. We thought we would stay for about a half hour and would up there until noon. It is so different from the way our House and Senate floors conduct business. It was straight out of \"Iron Lady\". The Tories tried to do an \"end around\" and ram a bill through containing the sale of alcohol in grocery stores without letting the opposition get a good look at the bill. Like I said, straight out of \"Iron Lady\". There was a whole lot of yelling, accusations, etc. It was wildly entertaining. So if you want to get a look at how things get done in the UK. Don't miss this trip and be sure to get yourself into the gallery to take in some of the dialogue! I hope it is as entertaining for you as it was for me."

I will be focussing on the official guided tour of the Palace Of Westminster (the \"Saturday & Summer Opening\" tours) which requires the purchase of tickets and walking through the security screening. Even if you don't pay for the tour, just walking around the exterior is incredible!!Transport to/from Parliament is as difficult as taking the Tube to Westminster station; on leaving the Tube station cross the road to the Parliament building and look for the statues of Oliver Cromwell and Richard the Lionheart; they're a few metres from the tour entrance. We purchased our tickets through the Internet, and also purchased the tour guidebook that came on special with the tickets. You pick your guidebook up at the Jewel Tower ticket booth (which is about 200m and across the road from Parliament, but requires navigating some stairs to reach), which is also a good place to sit down and wait for your tour time to open (you're only admitted 30min before your scheduled tour time).When you first show your tickets at the door you will be guided through metal detectors and baggage screening; put credit cards with chips through the X-ray machine, as they will trigger the metal detectors. (It's only metal detectors and X-rays, you don't have to remove shoes, but you will have to wear a pass around your neck.) From security you find your way into Westminster Hall, which is the last point where you are permitted to take photographs and use the facilities. The tour groups are about 20-30 people each; we arrived early and there was some space in an earlier tour, so we were permitted to go with an earlier tour group.Much of the tour is done standing. There are few places where you can sit during the tour (you can't sit in the Commons or the Lords) so if you can't stand for longer than 45min bring your seat-walker or book a wheelchair (I have severely flat feet but was able to make it). The endless standing is more than worth it: the art, the architecture, the history, the rituals....All of this was beautifully explained by a friendly, approachable tour guide.The tour ends in Westminster Hall, where public facilities and a cafe are available. The food selection isn't very inspiring and the cafe is crowded, but the Cornish Pasties are very tasty and welcome after the long walk. Tables become occupied VERY quickly, so don't be afraid to share tables with another party and talk about your recent tour."

The building is as beautiful on the inside as it is on the outside! Full of statues, paintings and ornate finishes, it reminded me of the beautiful architecture and decoration one would find in a church or a castle. Interesting to see the Queen's Robing Room.Photos can only be taken in the main waiting room, the original Palace of Westminster. I thought the entrance fee was a bit expensive, but the tour was worthwhile. Pick up a few souvenirs in the gift shop - I don't think you will find these items anywhere else!"

Neither my husband or I have ever been before and we were completely unprepared for what a brilliant time we had. The decor inside is extraordinary, incredibly intricate and detailed - if a surface can be decorated/carved/gilded or embellished it is ! Seeing the House of Lords was fascinating and while the subject under discussion in the House of Commons was rather dry (something to do with Croatian relations and free school meals in academies) it was really quite fascinating to see our legislature in action. The irony that we visited the day after Bonfire night was not lost on us ! There is an excellent cafe serving sandwiches, cakes, soup etc. It's not cheap but it's fairly standard prices for London/South EastThe security takes about 10 minutes to get through and I am non-plussed at the people complaining about security screening - this is the main \"senate\" of the United Kingdom and often houses our most prominent and influential people. It's a high level terrorist target - what do you expect, any old Tom, Dick or Harry to be waved through ?"

Not just to appreciate the extraordinary Great Hall and the House of Lords, bedecked in gold - impressive though they are.But to get a better understanding of how small the Commons chamber is, how claustrophobic and boisterous the lobbies must be when the house divides on a contentious motion, how ingrained the traditions are (the pidgeon hole system for example - or touching the foot of statues of celebrated past party politicians to give fortitude for the fray). And thus how real the issue of the confidence of the house is in the government of the country, and how bluster and bravado can triumph over judgement and common sense in the hothouse atmosphere of this tiny rather anachronistic place. Get your MP to take you round - it will open your eyes to both their wisdom - and their folly."

I highly recommend this, as the tour is very popular.The security before taking the tour is very tight. Make sure you have a photo ID with you. The tour itself is about 70 minutes long. There is limited ability to sit down while on the tour, and no picture-taking is permitted except in Westminster Hall before the tour begins or after it ends. Numerous tours form up at the same time in Westminster Hall and there is about three to four minute time lag between departures. Sometimes two tours can be in the same room at once, which can be distracting, but necessary given the popularity ot this tour. Just listen to your own guide to get the most of your tour.My tour guide was excellent. He explained the various rooms we visited and the significance of the design and the decoration. He also provided many antecdotes.The tour covers many of the areas that can be seen when the State Opening of Parliament is televised; but it also includes areas that I had not previously seen. I was surpised at how small both the House of Lords and the House of Commons are.I took the first tour in the morning and was able to walk to the Wellington Barracks afterwards and watch the guard form up and march to Buckingham Palace and march back after the Changing of the Guard."

We had very little queing and it was interesting to see how tight the security is. We didn't really know what to expect or how much we would see but if we had had a good tour guide, I'm sure it would have been the highlight of our trip as the building is incredible. We had a guide called Noel, who could hardly be heard and was incredibly pompous and full of his own self importance. He was incredibly boring and I tried to listen in on the other groups, which seemed more interesting and animated. I can honestly say, I drifted off in his group and only learned about the '8 minute rule'. The house of Lords & Commons is much smaller than we had imagined and we didn't actually think we would be allowed to enter there. You must remember you 'cannot sit down' anywhere, as was barked at us every 5 minutes. 2 children in our group were made a spectacle of because they dared sit on a step-poor kids were tired. It is a lot of walking and standing in one place, so not ideal for everyone. Would really love to tour it again but with a different guide to appreciate it and learn about its history. This guide had a very one-sided view of english history and had a bad attitude to visitors who moved in his eye-shot. Made a great tour a disppointing experience.We did have a nice lunch in the coffee shop afterwards, which was quite well priced and the staff were friendly also."

Very knowledgeable and a good sense of humour. The history was fascinating and we really enjoyed the tour. As part of a large group (25, some were only in groups of 3 or 4), we were whizzed past a lot of art I would have loved to look at properly, but the tour took 75 minutes and it flew by. My one problem was the lack of seating available. You are expected to stand in the pews where the Commons and the Lords sit and in other rooms you stand and listen too. There were three or four places to sit throughout the tour and I have problems standing for very long so ended up sitting on the stairs in the House of Lords as I was really starting to suffer. The stairs are deep and shallow, so getting up again was an issue! A few of the light weight fold up stools you so often see in museums would be very handy as I could have taken one and sat when/where necessary without causing too many problems surely? I suggest those with mobility problems discuss this in advance when booking a tour with their MP. I am due to go again with a different friend next month and will do this myself and see if any help is available that I wasn't aware of but if so, I feel sure our guide would have mentioned it to me as I do use a stick. My comments about accessibility are to make you aware, not put you off. Do go if you can manage it, we enjoyed it far more than we expected. We could have gone to the gem tower free but I was, unfortunately, too tired to do this by the time we finished."

Tickets for a guided tour of the House of Lords and House of Commons. \u00a315 for an adult and \u00a36 for a child. Tour took 90 minutes and involved standing in both Houses, right next to the Queen's throne, almost exactly where the Prime Minister stands and all the corridors and rooms in between. The guide was very knowledgeable. The treat started with the build up, walking down the St Stephens entrance, watched by all the crowds on the main road. Then, given a special pass and through a major security operation. Excellent for a wide eyed 10 year old to feel special, as he became 'a bit like James Bond'. Then, a guided tour with all ages, all nationalities. Billed as 45 minutes, we were still there 90 minutes later. Unfortunately, a lot of the talk bored the child, but that was easily overcome by taking him to one side and pointing out all the battles recorded throughout the building on statutes and big murials, making him aware of where the Prime Minister 'argues' on TV, showing him bullet holes from the war etc. Not quite the official tour notes, probably not \"politically correct\", but interest soared. We were then taken to the side rooms around the House of Commons and ushered through the voting doors where MPs are counted during a 'division'. We voted 'Yes' for free ice cream each day for all schoolchildren. Again, not quite the issue that the Tour guide was promoting to the rest, but certainly one that begged the question 'Can I go around and vote again?'. Bought a souvenir guide for him to take home. On the way home, imagination had been jolted and the conversation was amazing, as was the report to parents afterwards - he had absorbed much more than he let on! I would recommend this tour to anyone - it is long for children, geared for adults, but there is something very 'cool' about being a guest of the Houses of Parliament for a birthday treat!!"

Even though I went at the end of the day when my feet were killing me, it was well worth the visit. It's been one of my favorite buildings from the outside for a while, and the inside is just as gorgeous and detailed. Being American, it's fascinating to see how the UK Parliament operates and this tour gives a crash course in Parliamentary ways. The guide started us on a fast walk from Westminster Hall to the other end of the building, then took us through the House of Lords all the way up to the House of Commons. The Lords obviously have the most opulent rooms, with fantastic decorations and historical art, including a chamber lined portraits of the whole Tudor family. The Lords' section also includes the room where the Queen gets ready to open Parliament, which was very exciting to see. The Commons' chambers are more sparse but no less historically fascinating, with lots of sculpture and paintings. Westminster Hall is very sparse, but it is the oldest surviving part of the old Palace and thus a treat to walk around. It's jarring to see the 13th century architecture in the Hall after 90 minutes of Victorian design. The whole thing is very interesting if you're at all drawn to British politics and history and want to know how the Parliamentary system has evolved over the centuries."

There was a young boy in our group who yawned. She gave him a row and told him to cover his mouth and then looked at his mother and told her that she was trying to teach him manners. However, the boy yawned 2 more times on the tour and every single time she gave him a row. In the House of Lords she was pointing to one of the tv's, not everyone looked to where she was pointing as we were so interested in everything around us. She started snapping her fingers and scolded us for not looking at the tv she was pointing to. She told us, when I point at something for you to look at, you look at it. I would however recommend this tour as it is very interesting and worthwhile. I would do it again but not with that tour guide."

From there you proceed through the nineteenth century portion and then ascend to the visitor's gallery. I cannot recommend this enough: even if you stay for only 15 minutes, it will be worth it!

They only do tours on Saturday, so be sure to plan ahead.We visited the houses of Lords and Commons, and learned quite a bit about the history of England's legislature. They basically take you from one end of Parliament (starting with the Lords) through the long hallway that separates Lords from Commons. You don't get to sit anywhere in the Lords section, so be prepared to be on your feet for about an hour. You can sit in some parts of the Commons, however. You get to experience a little bit of what the MP's experience in the House of Commons, particularly when they're preparing for a vote. Our visit was definitely a highlight of our short trip to London."

On a separate occasion we went to PMQ's (got tickets through local MP - anybody who is interested in attending PMQ's should write to their local MP who can arrange tickets) it is pure theatre and something everybody should see. The chamber is virtually empty then with about 10 mins to go it fills up and the atmosphere builds until the PM and opposition leader start there game of verbal tennis across the dispatch box (on this day the prime minster got an early break of serve and went on to win 6-0!)"

The horizontal-on-vertical gothic architectural style is an absolute marvel. The place is huge, and the thirty minutes I spent walking the exterior (in the rain, no less) was a purely magical, unforgettable experience. It's a bit more difficult to access the interior tour but undoubtedly worthwhile, and I will certainly give it a go on my next trip to London!"

It can be a bit hard on the legs as there aren't many opportunities to sit - you are *especially* not allowed to sit down in either of the chambers.That said, this tour is well worth doing.

You have to go through the normal security checks on arrival and wear a 'cleared' neck tag during the tour. The tour takes well over an hour and you get to go through all the main chambers, see all the paintings and history. The tour is conducted by an official giude who we found to be very passionate about British Politics and quite amusing with it. There are lots of tours going on at the same time so it can be difficult to see everything as the head of tour guides moves you on if your guide lingers too long, and you can't take pictures!!!!Like most things there is a bit of a down side. Considering the majority of people doing the tour were of a more senior nature and had probably been trudging through London all day the staff, especially the security staff have a real stress if you sit down!!!!!!!!!!!! Considering the building has seats everywhere it seems a bit onerous not to allow the public to sit on any of them.It seems that you are only allowed to sit on a seat in Parliament if you have stood for election before hand. The rest of us are expected to suffer.So if you are a bit unsteady on your legs, can't stand up for long periods of time or have any other sort of infirmity, take a portable seat."

Not easy to arrange when each group contains around 25 people - yet they managed it very well as far as I can tell.The tour itself was an enjoyable blend of the familiar (entering both houses, with scenes familiar from TV broadcasts) to the novel (discovering the origins of the word \"lobbying\", for example) to the fascinating (learning that MPs sit in what used to be choir stalls). The guide balanced serious information with light hearted banter in a very polished style.The tour lasted a little under an hour and a half, and at 15 pounds each was money well spent."

It\u2019s packed full of an astounding amount of history in an absolutely fascinating architectural setting. Be prepared for quite a bit of walking though, as it\u2019s big\u2026really big. The tours start from my personal favorite space in the estate, Westminster Hall. It\u2019s the oldest part of the estate, as almost everything was destroyed in a fire back in the 1800\u2019s. It\u2019s also the only area where you can actually take pictures, as there is a strict no-pic policy in place in the rest of the buildings. The ceiling and woodwork in Westminster Hall is marvelous and truly something to see.I went on Saturday, September 8th, and there wasn\u2019t anything going on in terms as Parliamentary sessions or anything, as it was a break, but nonetheless, it was well worth it as it was very interesting to learn about how the House of Lords and Commons work, and the procedures and traditions that are followed. The guides are walking encyclopedias of British history, and it\u2019s fascinating to hear the drama and intrigue throughout the past 900 years or so. You\u2019ll know many of the more famous characters from your early school days, but nothing to the degree that it will be presented by the guides. Every room, every hallway, every nook and cranny, is full of fascinating history. I\u2019ve been to London more times than I can count, yet it was my first time visiting Parliament, and I now see what I\u2019ve been missing all these years. Even if you think you\u2019re not \u2018into\u2019 this kind of thing, I\u2019m pretty darned sure that you\u2019ll still enjoy this place. I\u2019m a truly jaded New Yorker that\u2019s pretty much unfazed by anything, but I\u2019ve got to say that I was truly struck by the beauty and historical significance of Parliament. Just go and enjoy, and I promise you that you\u2019ll have a great and interesting experience. Hope this helps."

Would say that the history and the building itself is of more interest than the current parliament that occupys the common room, as common people. Anyway not so much on them as we all have an opinion there. The building from the outside is just out of this world visually in its design and on entering, the amazement just goes further, unreal how these buildings were ever made, shame they don't make buildings similar in today's day and age. It's history is extremely interesting and educating. Families or couples should visit, and get a tour. Well worth it."

It was so grand that it didn't look real. There were huge paintings of all the royals on the walls of almost every room.

Both of our guides were knowledgeable and interesting. I love British history with all of its little quirks and traditions. It is what makes Britain unique. Book ahead and avoid the lines. The only negative is that during the summer there are so many tours that often the rooms are crowded and you can't hear your tour guide (groups are sent out in stages, but often there are three or four groups of 20+ tourists in the same room at the same time). Also, if you can't stand/walk for 60+ minutes, there are no places along the route to sit."

Our tour leader introduced herself and we were approx 20 in number, all different nationalities but all of us understood English. The tour takes in a number of rooms and although there are up to 3 other tour parties in the same room sometimes, it didnt detract from the very knowledgeable information our leader was giving. While you are requested to keep up with your particular tour group there is still plenty of time to take in almost everything, although we do plan a return trip as we both came out with information that the other had missed! You aren't allowed to take any photos except in the Great Hall where you gather for the Tour but there is a good shop full of souvenirs should you wish.The tour takes approx an hour and a half - time definitely worth spending here."

Besides, in the 1970s I worked there for a member of parliament. You need t o remember that although built in the gothic style it is not as old as it looks, it burned to the ground in the 19th century and was completely rebuilt, although Westminster Hall, which is the part from which visitors exit is genuinely very old. It would take too long to write about all the parts of interest but if visiting London, it is essential to visit the Mother of Parliaments. The only drawback is the long queues and searches, for which we can thank the terrorists, when I worked there, security was much less of a nuisance."

It was a real revelation. My son and I were both amazed at how small both chambers are and can certainly understand now why the Commons is so noisy sometimes. Our tour guide was a lady called Enid who was a wealth of knowledge and told us loads of details about the history of the building and the contents and facts about MPs and the parliamentary process. The only thing I would say is that I don't think it would be suitable for anyone who can't stand for long periods as there is very little opportunity to sit down and the tour lasts for approx 90 minutes.It is a very strict rule that nobody is allowed to sit on the benches in the Commons or Lords!"

I paid 15 pounds to take a 1 hr 15 min tour of the Houses of Parliament led by a knowledgeable staff.Underlying theme to the tour: \"Do Not Sit on Anything\". You get to go through both the Lords and Commons areas and stand in front of the seats, though you can't sit on them. You walk through the rooms used by the reigning monarch to change into their robes prior to opening Parliament. You also get to go through one of the \"Yes\" and \"No\" halls (where you can finally sit). I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to have strollers on the tour, so not recommended for young children.The content of the tour itself is sufficient to teach you a little bit about the British government but by no means is a replacement for a textbook. There's an unspoken assumption that the people on the tour either know about how the government is structured or comes from a country that has a similar governmental structure. Luckily for me the US government is sort of built similarly so not a giant leap, but if you're coming from communist China then I'd recommend reading up on the form of government before taking the tour.Mainly adults and teenagers in my tour group. There was one 7 yr old English girl, and I could tell a lot of the content was going over her head as she constantly had a puzzled look on her face, plus she was so tired after walking around and only being able to sit once during the entire tour. Again, I don't recommend it for people with young children as the attention span just isn't there yet.A few mind boggling things for Americans: House of Lords seats aren't voted on by the public but rather are either hereditary or life-term assignments for people knighted etc by monarch. Made me stop and think \"Wait, what?\" for a good long time. There's no veto power or checks and balances. If Commons and Lords disagree then Commons overrules (or that's what I was led to believe). Prime Minister is not voted on by public but rather is selected from within the majority party in the House of Commons. As an example: the Dems have the Senate and Republicans the House, with Pres. Obama a democrat, but under the British system, the president would really be a republican and Pres Obama merely the opposition leader with no input from the public at all.Highly recommend this tour and worth the 15 pounds."

The tour was better organized with smaller groups and it was much more informative. It's not a cheap tour but about on par with other tours in London. You have to book early and tickets can be printed online. Right next door to Westminster Abby. Very easy to do both on the same day with time left over to see the Churchill War Rooms. Parliament tour isn't the greatest for small kids. My teenage daughter was bored, but at 16 she still behaved. One note...they are serious about not chewing gum and staying with the group....as you'd expect.Cafe was great for afternoon tea. Very reasonably priced. Gotta have the clotted cream with a scone."

Most people come to see the building and look at it from the outside but the tour gives you a detailed history of the place and a good explanation of how it works. The security is thorough but straightforward. The tour begins in Westminster hall and takes you through all the main rooms of the building incliding the Queen's Robing room, the House of Lords and the Commons. The guides give you lots of details about the story of the building and explains many of the statues and paintings that you see as well as throwing in plenty of quirky litle facts. The only disappointment is that you are not allowed to take photos apart from in Westminster hall. There are only certain places you are allowed to sit down (not allowed in the Lords or the Commons!) but the tour lasts about an hour so it is manageable for most people. Well worth the \u00a315 and you need to book in advance."

The security is airport style and expected, bags through scanning machine etc. but it makes me feel safer. You meet in the old Westminster Hall for the start of the tour and a great photo opportunity - although photographs are not permitted past this point, so I had to settle with buying postcards which they sell in the shop at the end of the tour. The tour guide was brilliant, lovely spoken, knowledgeable and friendly I learnt so much. It was great to visit both the House of Lords and the House of Commons (you are not allowed to sit on the seats though). I am so glad I arranged to go on this 75 minute tour so much history - would recommend it."

Naturally there is a good amount of security, but it didn't take too long to receive our visitor badges. We walked through the historical Westminster Hall which was both beautiful and historically significant in itself. We had to wait a short while on benches in a gorgeous corridor before being ushered up the nondescript stairs to the modern visitor's gallery. Discussion wasn't too riveting when we visited, but nevertheless, each time we see a session on the news, my son says \"We were right there!\" Photography is allowed in Westminster Hall and outside and there are some great picture spots.

We of course took 1000s of pictures of the palace itself from the outside from all different angles. On the morning of the guided tour, it was raining heavily. We reached there at 10 for our 10.15 tour - had to wait in a long line and actually got in around 10.45 and the tour started around 11 am. So, once you are there the time didn't seem to matter. There were about 25 people in the group which I think is way too big a group to really engage with a tour guide. As first time visitors to UK, the information provided by the guide was interesting and fascinating although we over-heard different guides share different stories so there is probably lot more information that can be shared. However, after waiting in a long line to get in, the hour and half tour walking around seemed all that we could handle without lunch and with a young 7 year old. The palace is of course absolutely amazing and it was really interesting to hear how the Houses are formed and function. Definitely a MUST VISIT if you are going to London. We paid 15 GBP per person - totally worth it! Maybe going after lunch would help in enjoying the tour better without getting hungry and tired."

I left the tour extremely angry at the waste of time and money. The palace and Westminster Hall in particular are wonderful but it is very poorly served by whoever it is that runs these tours.Our guide did not have sufficient knowledge: he didn't even know how many MPs there were and he was unable to identify the statues. I knew more than he did and we became very frustrated. Not only were we informed 4 times that our monarch was Queen Elizabeth II but in such a fawning manner that we cringed with embarrassment (and neither of us are anti-monarchist). I couldn't stand the patronising level of commentary and was desperate to leave. I was angry at being charged for such tripe. It seemed that the tour was heavily pitched towards non-UK visitors with a poor grasp of English. We asked to change groups because of the pitch of the guide and were basically told to put up with it. If you are a UK / Commonwealth citizen with a modicum of knowledge of our constitution decide whether the entry price is worth entry to Westminster Hall and Palace - NOT the tour. I suggest whoever runs the tours to visit the Cabinet War Rooms, the Globe Theatre or Hampton Court where they treat all their visitors with respect and intelligence."

The Mother of Parliaments is a fantastic building to see in its own right, but if you factor in the historic events (such as where various famous people lay in state) and the art collection, it is well worth a visit even before the theatre of the House of Commons. If you go when in session, you can ask to visit the public gallery and should not have to pay. Or you can put a card in to ask to speak to your MP. S/he may not come to see you but it is your right to lobby him or her. You may find the actual debates rather staged and not very illuminating, despite The Speaker's best efforts. And the House of Lords looks like a lot of old wax work dummies - can this really be representative democracy? But the inmates add to the charm of the place."

Now when we see these particular places on the news stories, we will have a better understanding of what is taking place and where it's happening!

The security personnel are very courteous and efficient.Our guide was excellent - she explained the history and the workings of the Houses eloquently and with some humour. Visitors are divided into small groups so it is easy to hear and see everything described on the tour. We saw the opening ceremony of Parliament on television a few weeks after our visit and it was great being able to identify the rooms and to understand the procedures as they had been explained to us on the tour.

The throne that the Queen sits on to open Parliment in Lords was stunning, as well as the hammerhead beams and other ornamentals and paintings in the passages. We listened to debates and found very similar dilemas to those in the U.S. being discussed.

(you can sit in the public gallery and listen to the them raising issues). You do have to go through stringent security which is understandable and it does make you feel extra safe. Inside there is also a cafe where you can get a light lunch at a reasonable price.We also had the opportunity to see inside Speakers' House which was very stately where they sometimes hold state dinners. There was also a very elaborate ornate bed that was last slept in by King George Fourth and there were some lovely views of the river. Our guide was one of the men from the speakers' procession (still in his costume).The only thing that slightly spoilt the day was the rudeness of one of the policeman, just before the speakers' procession he very aggressively and loudly said \"move back, move back, move back, move back\" right in the face of one of my friends who was over sixty years old, I'm not sure if he was just having a bad day or he just expected her to jump. This is just the sort of attitude that gives policing a bad name, a bit of customer service would not go amiss. It would have been far nicer for him to say \"I'm sorry I need you to move back as we have make room for a group of school children coming through\". Or perhaps he does not realise that people cannot move as quick as when they are in their twenties."

The Building itself is pretty big and impressive. My advise is to go at night time and view it from the South Bank. Try and go on the hour so you get to hear the clocks 'bongs' There leave the building lit up until about 12.05am, so you can go there and film the clock at midnight. 5 Mins later the building is plunged into darkness and its time to go home!"

I remember at the time thinking that this seemed very reasonable for what was potentially on offer - but it surpassed all expectation.The whole thing went like clockwork. We arrived in the morning and I parked my car in the Car Park in Abingdon Road, just nearby. Two minute walking distance from the Houses of Parliament. I had a picnic in the car which we collected later and ate \"for free\" in St. Jame's Park.Everything was beautifully organised. I enjoyed \"asking a Policeman\" where the Cromwell Entrance was. I am sure I could have found it - but I just wanted to do it. They were wonderfully helpful!No queue, and you are ushered in at your allocated time. Expect a thorough search - well, I think it's sensible.Barry was our guide. He was good! Not too much information all the way round that your mind drifts off with overload, but just enough to be interesting. Thanks so much. The groups are fairly small, so plenty of time to ask questions. There are other groups going around at the same time, but it is so well organised, that you never feel squashed or hassled.The rooms in the building that you are taken to see are quite breathtaking.They cover the Queen's Robing Room, through to the House of Lords and Commons.Magnificent and Interesting.I would recommend this to anyone, children included. The whole thing takes about an hour and a half. I think it was about \u00a315. I never knew you could do this tour - and it was quite wonderful.Why not tie it in with a visit to Westminster Abbey? If you go to a service, it costs nothing and you are treated to some of the best choral singing in stunning surroundings. Very good for the inner soul. This made me feel so proud to be British and we were lucky enough to coincide with the Trooping of the Colour - so we popped round the corner to the Mall and waived to the Queen and all her family and experienced the pomp and ceremoney of the guncarriages and most of the British Army in all its Splendour.\u00a315 a head for an incredible day out!"

Must admit we stumbled into two interesting arguments on the floors with the Commons debating a new defamation law and the Lords debating student financial aid funding. Both timely and topical here at home! We wouldn't recommend this visit for young children as the wait time is just too boring and you must be quiet (and sign an agreement document to \"not disturb\" either House will visiting.

It is very interesting how MPs stand, moan, and laugh during the course of the session: quite a contrast from Congress. If you are early in line, there is a talk from the Information Office, where an explanation is given of what session you are sitting followed by a brief overview of how parliament works (helpful for foreign visitors).Overall highly recommended.

I was also surprised to learn that most of the buildings are not so old, because of a fire in the 19th century, but were rebuilt to replicate the original. It's not cheap, but worthwhile.

            "review": "palace vs parliament. Many people are attracted to Westminster Palace to see the House of Commons and House of Lords. Politicians require security and thus make viewing the actual palace more complicated. In addition, politicos wish to rub elbows with their own constituents, therefore the building is restricted from \"overseas visitors\" except on Saturdays and in August-September, when Parliament is not in session. Tourists CAN schedule visits for the purpose of watching debates, by queuing up on St Margaret Street. The House of Lords' line is usually shorter; once you are in you may go to either.Westminster Palace has existed since the 11th century and did not become home to Parliament until the 13th century. Two fires, in 1520 and 1834, caused extensive renovation. The latter rebuild, by architect Charles Barry, incorporated the medieval buildings into the current \"perpendicular gothic\" style we see today. The palace was also retouched after a bomb struck during WWII, and more lately has been cleaned of grime from air pollution. The building is now divided into the Old and the New. Surviving all the above are the original gems: Westminster Hall, the Cloisters of St Stephen's, the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft and the Jewel Tower. Even some of the New rooms are lovely, such as the Queen's robing room, complete with throne.The Clock Tower, of course, holds the 13-ton bell named Big Ben. But the only way to tour that tower is to marry a British citizen. Be sure to notice the statue of Richard the Lionheart, plus Rodin's Burghers of Callais. Blue badge guides run 1 1/2 hour tours continuously in summer."

We booked the tickets just two days in advance, couldn't print out the tickets because we didnt have those facilities but we were greeted at the gate by a friendly guy showing us where to go to pick up our tix. two minutes walk away we had our tix handed to us in an envelope all ready for us went back to the entrance, waited in a queue till our time was called, through security efficiently and quickly and we were shown to our tourguides spot.Liz introduced herself, explained some rules (like dont take photographs though of course someone tried. There's always one) and off we went. Liz was incredibly knowledgable, friendly and looked after us carefully. Not surprisingly you can't touch paintings or furniture so you do have to be careful. But wow. the architecture and interiors of the palace of westminster are quite incredible. the details, the painstaking craftmanship - blow you away. I bet MP's and staff who work there take it for granted but they shouldn't. How lucky they are to work in such a building. We will be back to climb Big Ben one day (you have to organise that in advance via your own MP - UK residents only)I highly highly recommend visiting the Houses of Parliament if you visit London. (only little comment for suggested improvement would be to upgrade the visitor toilets. Soon.)"

Took the tube to the Westminster stop - got off & at the top of the tube exit you're right under Big Ben --- great way to start the adventure. Then go around the corner to start Parliament adventure. NOTE: TICKETS aren't in the Parliament/ Westminster Hall building - they are across the street about halfway down the \"block\" on the outside of a little white building - cross the street, go down some stairs and you should see the line. Get your tickets, then cross the street again and go through a few ticket \"checkers\" to stand in queue. In queue - they count you off and give you a lariat for around your neck that will eventually hold your ticket/ pass with your photo on it. then through to an airport - type security system - metal detectors, bags on conveyor belt for x ray, etc. (There are armed guards too) Then your ID on your lariat and into the ground area. From there you can take in some of the amazing outside architecture (wow!) and we were a bit overwhelmed at the amount of detail in the small part of the outside we saw. Gargoyles, grotesques, royal symbols, statuary and more. Then you can go into the main hall - Westminster Hall. Here is where Kings & Queens were annointed and laid to rest; here is where the trials of Guy Fawkes and William Wallace were held. Feel the history! Amazing wood beamed ceiling ( I think from the 1200's? ) and statuary. TIP: look for the plaques in the floor - these note various trials, burials, etc. Great piece of history. This is where you can queue up for the tour - there are lines for all the major languages in case English is not your mother tongue. We only waited about 5 minutes before our tour - groups are a maximum of 25 so that you can easily get around & hear the guide. There is no eating or drinking or cell phones during the tour. **NOTE: except for Westminster Hall there is NO photography allowed - so put the cameras away. Tour starts and you go into Parliament Hall - I can begin to do justice to all that you see. But you get to go into and stand IN the House of Lords and the House of Commons. The voting halls for Commons, the \"press\" areas, the amazing hallways with giant paintings depicting key moments in history. Amazing busts and statuary of key Parliament members; people in the arts & sciences and more. GREAT tour guide who gives fun and educational insight and learned a LOT. Learned how Churchill kept Commons small after the war, nothing is electronic or \"remote\" - all done by hand, in person. Learned the Queen cannot go in the House of Commons (listen for the fun story!) and much much more. You come back out after the tour into Westminster Hall again - perfect for more picture taking and there is a small gift shop just inside Parliament hall (start of official tour area) as well. Take time on way out to look at other parts of the hall, Big Ben, etc. Took us about 1.5 hours for the \"official\" part of the tour but at least another hour before & after for picture taking and being in awe. Highly recommended - although kids may not be so interested or entertained. I would put this as perhaps a \"15 and up\" attraction."

I have little knowledge of UK politics but I found this very interesting."

The great hall where the Great Queen Mother was kept in her coffin while the guards were rehearsing the ceremony is also interesting for its size.

If you're very lucky, you might be able to get into the crypt, which is mind-blowingly lavish and beautiful. Next, visit central lobby, and be amazed again at the opulent decor. If you can, try to get onto the terrace to experience unrivalled views of the river and the London eye. We were lucky enough to be accompanied by our MP's researcher, who gave us an in-depth guided tour, before taking us to eat in one of the many restaurants there. Apparently, you can also write to your MP and ask for tickets to Prime Minister's question time, which must also be fascinating.Fun fact: there is a hairdresser hidden in the depths of the Houses of Parliament!"

It was very interesting to see all the places shown on TV and to actually be there. Security was thorough and you weren't allowed to wander on your own but the guide was informative and friendly. There were several tours going at once but wherever possible groups were arranged by the language spoken (ie all Spanish speakers were grouped together etc) and staff were very helpful in directing people to the correct tour for them. Tours last about 1.5 hours. It was a really good and slightly unusual way to spend a Saturday in London and I would recommend it not only for foreign visitors but for Brits too."

If you are a UK citizen it is easy to arrange a visit through your local MP.Tours are escorted by very knowledgeable guides and take about 75 to 90 minutes. Providing there is no sitting taking place at the time of your tour, you get inside both the Commons and the Lords chambers which are remarkable places. The rest of the Palace is also beautiful, and beautifully kept, considering that it is a place of work for hundreds of people.Westminster Hall, where your tour begins and ends is also pretty spectacular with the hammer-beam roof being the largest medieval timber roof in Northern Europe."

Westminster Hall is the oldest remaining part of the palace and is really breath-taking.

The Palace of Westminster is the heart of democracy, commissioned in 1097 and built in 1099. It has survived many things, including more recently (1600's) the great fire of London, and the blitz in the 2nd World War and so much more!Top Tip would be...write and ask your MP for passes.

The checks are just like the airports but everyone is checked as they pass into the building. Once inside you are free to watch the debates from the visitors galleries or as they call it in the House of Lords, the 'Strangers Gallery'A very worthwhile visit for anyone whether a UK resident or overseas visitor.Don't leave it out of your itinerary.

Then we entered the Commons via Speakers chair, and stood in the governments benches, but a stern police officer prevented you from sitting on them! We had a great day, escorted by a very good guide who was an Usher of the House. We also bumped into a few Lords and MPs as well, which made the day. A final look in the old House of Westminster, where Charles 1 was tried, then home, very tired and knowing we had seen all there was. I recommend a trip like this, it will open your eyes."

The guide also gives you an insight into the voting process and explains some of the terms used and the procedures gone through to approve a bill in the two houses outlining the differences between the two.

When booking select the language you wish to hear on your tour.Huge cue waiting for entry to Parliament and airport type check-in, so give yourself plenty of time for this before your scheduled tour.After entry there are toilets and a decent cafe.The tour starts in the huge hall where the Queen Mother lay in state after her death and numerous trials have taken place in the distant past, such as, Guy Fawkes, etc.Our guide was brilliant and made the visit really enjoyable and informative.BEWARE - If you are the type of person who needs to sit down occasionaly. You are informed that you can only sit down when invited to do so and this was only once towards the end of the tour. The tour commences up quite a lot of steps and there are steps in the Commons and Lords to negotiate. Seats have stickers on saying you cannot sit down.The tour took about 75 minutes, maybe a little longer."

The building never fails to thrill, as its walls sing of its history and the momentous events that have taken place there. The Committee Rooms are just as beautifully decorated as the grander public areas, and the Members' Chapel is exquisite. Occasionally if I have time after our meeting finishes, I go up into the Strangers' Gallery and watch the debates in the House of Commons. This is a privilege that is open to every UK citizen and overseas visitor, and something of which we can be justifiably proud. The Members' Dining Room serves an impressive level of cuisine, and if you are also lucky enough to be treated to tea on the Terrace on a sunny summer day, this view from the banks of the Thames is breathtaking."

London has many attractions and it is impossible to choose which one is the best tovisit and which one gives you value for money, so my husband and I decided to visit the Houses Of Parliment. We booked in advance on the internet, very easy to do. I must saywhat a lovely experience, we had a guided tour which lasted 1 & 1/2 hours and the timeflew by. We both learned more about the kings & Queens of England and all parlimentmembers through history than one could ever learn through reading books or watchingtelevision programmes. You have to go through a security proccess much like airports, which one can understand. The tour guide was lovely and very knowledgable and youcould ask any questions you wish. There is a coffee shop and obviously toilet facilities. The Houses Of Parliment is very easy to get to by underground, and the sight of Big Ben greeting you is magnificent. I would certainly recommend visiting the House Of Parliment ."

The whole building shines in gold and the detail and carvings that cover the whole Parliament are absolutely stunning. What's more amazing is it's so old that everything's been done by hand. There is more detail here than on the Westminster Abbey. It's worth a walk over to see, especially in the daylight. You won't be disappointed. If you head over to the Westminster Abbey you can see the original burial spot of Oliver Cromwell (the statue in front of the Parliament), and hear how that ended.

            "review": "The House of Parliament; Democracy in Action. A highlight of our trip to London was our visit to Westminster Palace to watch British government in action. When Parliament is in session they often work on Monday nights as late as 10:00 pm. We went through security and were given badges to wear on lanyards. We first went toward the House of Commons and were told to expect a wait of up to an hour. But our timing was perfect. We walked right in and found seats in the balcony where we could both watch the members on the floor or for close-ups watch the TV monitors placed around the balcony.The debate that night appeared to be about an amendment from the Opposition party that would have allowed unemployed to receive stipends from the government even if they had up to \u00a350,000 in savings. The attendance during the debate was quite sparse but when the vote was finally taken members poured in to vote. First an oral vote was taken and the decision of the presiding officer was that the amendment was defeated. But then a second vote was taken on the question and this time the officer cried in a loud voice for a \u2018Division of the House\u2019. This time members walked through one door to vote yes and another door to vote no. After a time the presiding officer yelled out \u2018to lock the doors\u2019 and voting was finished. Shortly thereafter he announced the voting results.Having watched both a debate and vote in the House of Commons we then left and made our way to what was now a waiting line to get into the House of Lords. The wait was not too long and we soon were able to sit in the balcony overlooking the much more ornate House of Lords. We watched for a while but left before any vote occurred. The subject of the debate appeared to be over a trade issue with the Common Market and whether a government should be able to veto a contract that did not favor a domestic industry. One of the debaters was a Lord wearing bright red socks. The Lords did not look as sophisticated as I expected that they might.Parliament in action is worth watching wherever you are from but for Americans it was wonderful seeing the more intimate atmosphere of the British Parliament."

It is possible as a UK citizen/voter to access the building, simply asking to see your MP to whom a message will be pasased if they are in the House at the time. Many visitors probably regard it as more of a museum than a functioning place of work so if access seems difficult and limited I guess remember that security restrictions apply to this and all public buildings in this age. Allow lots of time in the summer.Also worth visiting is the Parliamentary bookshop on a stand-alone site on the corner of Whitehall/Bridge Street (near where everyone stands to get a picture with Ben Ben clock/St Stephen's tower in the back ground. In the immediate area check out the underground architecture of Westminster tube station - 120ft below the ground and the River Thames."

I've kept in touch with friends who work here and my old boss, and knew when I took my husband for his first visit that we would undoubtably take a tour. If you are a UK resident, you can sign up for a tour for free, if you are a non-resident, there is a fee, but this 75 minute tour is absolutely incredible and worthwhile. You only need to do it once in your life and you will remember it for a lifetime. Not suitable tour for kids under 8 as it is a lot of walking and a longer tour."

I booked a private tour of Parliament through my MP (anyone can request this through their mp, but do it well in advance of a trip as they are usually booked up quite a bit beforehand). The tour starts with airport style security checks at the entrance before entering the Palace of Westminster (Westminster Hall). This is where your private guide will meet you and advise you of the history of the hall, its various purposes (you can see the plaques where various kings, queens and former PM's lay in state). The guide will then take you into the main building and allowed us access into the restricted areas of parliament such as the Royal Chambers, the houses of lords and the house of commons. It was great to see these rooms I had seen on TV so many times and stand in the spot where the Prime Minsiters of this country have put forward the laws that have created the Britain we know today, it was also brilliant to see the history and hear about the traditions that encompass the building that controls out country.This was my second tour of Parliament and both times the guides had been very knowledgable, but on this occasion the guide recognising we were Scottish customized with a scottish them which was much appreciated. From this tour you are free afterwards to meet with your mp, visit the public areas such as the galleries or the restaurant and just take in the crowds in the center of the building infront of the post office.This tour is free to all british citizens and is well worth doing. I also got to purchase some House of Commons Scotch Whisky from the tourist shop - A nice 10yo malt from Speyside which I have yet to sample but have added to my collection."

You get to visit both chambers (sitting on the benches is strictly forbidden) and see behind the scenes. There were plenty of anecdotes and a lot of unexpected details that got people laughing. The tour does involve quite a lot of walking (including one quite long set of steps) and going through some tight security and is not recommended for people of limited mobility, but it is well worth doing. Tours are also offered in various languages apart from English. You have timed entry, with a group of 20 entering every 15 minutes. For anyone with a love of history, politics or architecture it is a must. Photography is strictly forbidden once the tour has started, but is permitted in St. Stephens Hall and you can, for example, photograph yourself standing by the plaque marking the spot from which Nelson Mandela addressed the two Houses on the steps of the Hall."

Also based on the wood carved interior, this is really one of the most unique and beautiful parliament buildings i have seen in the world. I enjoyed the tour and highly recommend it in line with other London top sights - Buckingham palace and changing of guard, Tower, Tower Bridge."

We certainly enjoyed the architecture and design of the building and the tie-in with Big Ben; however, the best attraction for us was attending a session of the House of Commons (HOC), while they were discussing/debating controls over general policing, as an outcome of the riots that happened in August. It was a fascinating display of oratory, sarcasm and polite, orderly insulting that we should consider adopting in our own legislative processes! The MP's were really getting into the discussions with the representatives from 'the government', but always maintained a high level of parliamentary procedure to gain control of the floor and have their say. Brilliant!The House of Lords (HOL)...well...let's just say this: after watching the brilliant discourse in the HOC for well over 2 hours, watching 15 minutes of the HOL was like watching a display of rigor mortis. We'd love to go back to the HOC sometime when the PM is presenting!"

You don't need a ticket to go in and listen to the statesmen speak - just name, address and phone number on an index card and you can sit in the gallery above the House of Commons or Lords. If you want to see the robing room, side areas and main building - then you must take the tour (for non-UK citizens).HOWEVER i had the awful misfortune of getting the worst tour guide (red, pink, orange haired, woman in her 60s - Eidon?), paired with being the only American (native English speaker) in a group of English as a second language tourists, including two Russian ladies that nearly got the whole group put in handcuffs.The tour was horrible !! as every few mins the guide was off tracking down the stragglers -- we lost a lot of the explanations and descriptions because by the time she got everyone in the right place, the next group was already pushing through. Luckily while we waited for the others - there was usually one or two other guide groups we could eaves drop on the other guide's descriptions of legal process or the architecture.Tour is about 90 mins, but make sure you arrive about 15mins before the tour start time as you have to go through a very lengthy security building, several ramps and cues."

At the age of 60+ I finally made a visit on a Saturday morning with an overseas visitor to the Palace of Westminster House of Parliament and House of Lords.Should have gone years ago! This place that we habitually see on TV is just amazing.I suggest to book tour on the internet to avoid queuing or disappointment and book the earleiest tour possible before it gets too busy. Study the website for opening days & times. If not prebooked the ticket office is across the road near Westminster Abbey.Security to get in is pretty daunting so the less you are carrying the better.Our guide was superb and clearly loved his job and took a pride in showing people around and somehow managed to remain non political.At first you collect for the tour in the great hall where there are toilets,gift shop & cafe.The tour commences with the House of Lords area and ends at the House of Parliament.What you will experience is pretty stunning. No photography except in great hall.Nearest metro is Westminster. There are good photo opportunities outside the building,To sum up just go ! Check open dates very carefully."

Overall I would rank it in the top 3 tourist attractions I have visited in London!I booked tickets ahead of time online, and it was well worth it. I waited in no lines, went right through security, waited about 5 minutes for the tour to begin.You get a great overview of how the British system works (as an American I had no clue) and get to see all the rooms seen on TV. The tour begins by following the Queens path through the opening of Parliament, and through that story you go through some of the less famous rooms - the story makes it very entertaining. You then go through both chambers (Lords and Commons) and get a great understanding at how Parliament works. I found it very educational.The guide was first-rate and really knew what he was talking about. I found him entertaining and engaging. There were many tours going on at once, but it was very well organized and you could hear the guide at all times.I also ate lunch at their cafe, and found the food to be very good and reasonablly priced. They also have very nice and free toliets, a rare find in London!Overall, I very highly recommend this tour. Be sure to book ahead of time, and beware of the opening times (summer opening and certain weekends...not open when in session)."

After finding the ticket office which is located across the street and down some steps we had a very short wait until out tour started. We had one of the best tour guides ever. She was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. I highly recommend visiting while the government is not in session. We were able to walk through the House of Lords and Commons. Our tour guide was able to give a good understanding of roles and responsibilities of both houses. Seeing both Houses from the floor was even more dramatic. As with any tour it is the tour guide that makes or break the tour and ours was top notch. Personally for me this was the most interesting tour during our trip to London."

There are no toilet stops and not many sit downs if you are the sort of person who might need these on a 1.5 to 2 hour trip. Such a shame as this is a place steeped in history and there must be many an amusing tale to tell. Going through the efficient airport style security was the highlight of the visit!

The tour guide was a young man who got the balance just right between being informative whilst not waffling on. One thing we were surpised at is that the tour only takes you to certain parts of the houses of parliament (house of commons, Lords, Queens robbing room) - large amounts of the building are not visited. You are instructed to stay with your group at all times during the tour and you will always notice that the security guards and police officers within the building are ensuring that you do this!This was a bit of a shame as we would have liked to have spent longer in certain rooms and 'taking it all in' but it is understable that for security reasons this isn't going to happen.There is a nice cafe right by where the tours begin and end which was very reasonably priced.When booking our tour we had noted that you were not allowed to bring anything more than a small bag with you but we saw people in there with many large shopping bags and overnight bag (we had paid to store our luggage at Waterloo station so that we would not have to bring it in with us). We turned up a bit early for our booked tour time but the staff allowed us to join the next tour that was going which was great, saved us waiting around.A fantastic tour, excellent value, highly recommend (even interesting for people like me who aren't really all that intersted in politics but who would just like to have a nose around!)"

If you're in London at any of those times then it's well worth a visit. Be prepared for surprises though as the we went on a Thursday morning when it was supposed to be open but there was some emergency MPs meeting so we had to go back the next day. \u00a315 for adults so it's not cheap, but it's a once in a lifetime experience so go for it. There are of course concessions for students, OAPs etc. Get the tickets from the ticket office which is the white building further along from the entrance, over the road. Tours have established times and you have to get your tickets 20 mins before, as it will take you some time to get through security which is understandably tough. They also do foreign language tours, although these are less regular so check in advance if you want French or Italian etc.You get to see all the main parts - Westminster Hall (departure and arrival - thoe only place you can takes photos), the robing room which is used once a year when the monarch opens Parliament, House of Lords and House of Commons plus connecting rooms, corridors etc. Lords is of course much more ornate and interesting from an artistic point of view, but there's so much history attached to everything that in the end it's all interesting. Bad point: \"modern\" staue of M. Thatcher! We had a very good guide (Ian) - a history teacher type but very good at explaining everything and answering questions. It's pot luck, but I imagine they are all up to the same standard. Groups are of around 20 people and the tour takes about 75 mins. Warning: not much 'sitting down' time or even possibilities (do *not* sit on the Commons' benches!) - OK but some may find it tiring. Toilets and caffetteria acessible from Westminster Hall. Not cheap, but you're in the heart of London. Free souvenir badges and pencils!All in all a very interesting experience and vital for anyone whos interested in British history or indeed the beginnings of democracy in the modern sense."

She was obviously not listening during this part of her course, as we subsequently received a very nice email from Westminster giving us the information we had asked for. Note to Guide: \"Oh I am not too sure about that,\" would have been fine! Apart from that and sometimes that is all it takes to take the edge off an experience, the tour was well worth the money.

It just happened to be open for tours when we walked by and we took the opportunity to see it. It was fabulous. The guide was telling us who and when and the kings and queens, prime ministers, and so many stories about the great halls, the actual place where Parliament meets (we were not allowed to sit down!). It was really a great tour. Took about an hour and was something I won't forget soon. Only open on Saturday's the sign said. Well worth the pounds sterling to see it."

Parliament is surprising very beautiful inside with some exquisite rooms and works of art that will delight you. The House of Commons is much small than it looks on TV and it's no wonder that it's standing room only some times. Our guide was very entertaining and the hour or so that we were there went very quickly. Worth every penny."

The grandiosity of the paintings and structures is really stunning.. And house of commons is so much smaller than what it appears on TV!!!I learnt a few more things than what I already knew about the parliament from our guide, however I would say that the tour was too rushed as well as been disturbed by all the other groups moving around us. The tours could be much better organised, I think. Also, if you book the tickets online, you could find it hard to understand where to collect and where to go to enter the Parliament itself. There are not many indications. Remarkable visit, but the overall organisation needs quite a lot of improving."

The next time you see the House of Commons debating, you'll see the chairs you stood by. Kind of cool to know that. The guides really know their history. Also interesting to learn differences between House of Commons and Lords, if you didn't know. House of Lords membership can be passed down by vs. Commons. Also, learn about process during voting, debates, and when the queen is there.The place is massive, you get a sense from walking through the sections they take you through. Not sure if kids would like it, epsecially little ones.After buying your tickets, give yourself 1/2 hour to get through security. Seemed to me that you have timed tickets, but when you get in they just put you on first line till it fills up to about 25 people and they take you all up. So if you are running late or stuck in security, you should be OK as it doesn't seem like they are sticklers. But to get on time you planned on, best to do the 1/2 hour advance. When I bought ticket they said 15 minutes but it took me over 20 to get in.Also, no photos inside except for very first hall they take you in. You can't sit for a lot of the tour. Occassionaly there are spots where you can sit, they will tell you."

As mentioned on the ticket I arrived about 20 minutes early and I waited in line to go through security, my bag was checked, I went through one of those airport type gates and I also had my picture taken which I had to hang on a lanyard.After that onto the great hall for the start of the tour, and since I was solo I was able to join a group nearly starting. I had missed the introduction though and as we walked swiftly through a lot of beautifully decorated rooms I wondered why we didn't stop, but we just walked to the end and started there.What a wonderful tour through some amazing rooms, where I wondered where there was a centimeter of room left that wasn't decorated. We learned about the houses themselves, how the Queen goes about the opening of parliament every year, how the house of lords/commons works(I particually loved the voting), and why there are curtains about knee high in the public gallery in the house of lords....Added to that I loved that we where in the rooms that you've seen on tv so many times(even though we weren't allowed to sit down). It seemed very busy, often there where 4 groups in one room but our guide was excellent and it was never hard to hear him.Overall excellent experience and I would throuroughly recommend."

We got to watch a few speakers in the House of Lords, which wasn't very interesting as there wasn't much attendance on a Friday afternoon. Security to get in was irritating, and seeing this place wasn't worth the hassle. It was airport-type security, but in addition to the usual procedures I was also patted down, which I am getting sick of while traveling. Not only that, but to enter the viewing gallery we had to hand over all our possessions, including my handbag, which had all our money in it plus our passports and digital camera and new cell phone. No lockers were provided with secure padlocks; our belongings were stored in open shelves with dividers, and we were handed a number to retrieve our belongings when leaving. I didn't like this at all and it made me very nervous that our money and other items could be stolen, so we didn't watch the speakers in the House very long as I don't like my personal belongings being left with strangers. When we went to retrieve our things, there was no one at the desk and it took a while for someone to get back there to hand us our things. Anyone could have walked up and stolen our items and the belongings of others. So be warned, since no one else on the first page of reviews has mentioned it, that they will demand everything you are carrying, no matter how personal. If I had known that beforehand, I would have made preparations for it, or skipped this place altogether."

All the buildings are just gorgeous, and lots of historic frescoes and paintings.

But the lights are on at Westminster Palace--and that's not just for making it look pretty at night. The MPs are putting on an after hours show in there, and though their debate isn't exactly mud wrestling, they're still slinging barbs across the room at the opposing party. The seating gallery in the House of Commons is an architectural wonder by itself, fashioning a fascinating fishbowl out one of the world's most recognizable meeting rooms by slicing right through the wood paneling and green leather benches with a glass wall. On the other hand, visiting the House of Lords is almost quaint and kitschy-- modernism completely missed the \"Strangers Gallery,\" but in place of glass and steel, you get gold lea, heraldry and statuary everywhere. It's surreal just how much it is just what was in your imagination-- but even more so. But more impressive is how late the MPs and Lords go-- at least till 10 pm. By then, you still have time to go see what happens in the bars."

My wife was less than delighted when I told her I had booked a tour of the Houses of Parliament during our city break to London. However, she was pleasantly surpised and thoroughly enjoyed it - the tour included : eloquent & well informed tour guide (only 12 of us in the party), walking through the corridors of power, standing in the Queen's dressing room, walking through the House of Lords' debating chamber, standing next to the P.M.s lectern etc."

I bought and printed my ticket on Ticketmaster for \u00a314.00 (no booking fee). I went on the 9.30am tour and it was less crowded then. I had to go though security before I got to Westminster Hall where the tour commenced. Westminster Hall is very impressive and this is where heads of state and the royal family lie in state after they have died. They have brass plaques on the ground identifying where they lay. This hall also survived the Great Fire of London. This is the only room that you are permitted to take photographs in. Our guide was Harri and I really enjoyed his tour \u2013 the tour was 75 minutes but it never felt rushed and you could ask as many questions as you liked. We were brought to the room where the Queen prepares to open government sessions each November and shown the route she takes to the House of Lords. The House of Lord is impressive also with its red leather seats and paintings. We were not allowed to sit down in here \u2013 apparently only elected or invited representatives are permitted to sit down here! We were brought to Central Lobby and then onto the House of Commons with it\u2019s green leather seats and it was explained to us how voting takes place and told where the leaders sit. It\u2019s amazing to think the amount of history that has passed through this building. A lot of the stained glass windows are not the original ones \u2013 they were blown out during World War 2. All in all I really enjoyed the tour. It was very interesting and informative. The interior is just as spectacular as the exterior and I would definitely do this tour again. It\u2019s a must see for anyone visiting London."

We have always watched the proceedings inside the house on TV and wanted to see inside the palace for ourselves, so we booked our tickets through the house of commons website and then made it part of our weekend break. It is absolutely fantastic. We had a great guide and the ornate decoration has to be seen to be believed. The highlight for me though was being in the house of commons chamber with its famous green leather benches. A must for anybody interested in history and pollitics."

I'm clearly in the minority here, but I'd advise most travelers against a visit to the Houses of Parliament, unless they can get in without waiting.Yes, the Palace of Westminster ranks among the world's most iconic buildings, but the outside is far cooler than the inside. (The House of Lords looks elegant enough, but the House of Commons actually borders on shabby.)Watching Parliament in action seems like it should be fascinating, but unless you can score a seat at Prime Minister's Question (and you can't) the proceedings are dull as dishwater.You'll get into the Commons, steeped in veneration for this cradle of democracy, and rather than seeing a full chamber in full throated debate over something cool, you see five guys reading speeches about parking meters in York onto the record. This quickly grows tiresome.That said, it's worth a look if you can get in without waiting, which is very possible at off hours. I've strolled right into evening sessions in the winter months. But it's certainly not worth standing in line for many hours to witness. Do you really care about those parking meters in York?"

I didn't plan on taking a tour of the Houses of Parliament, and it was a sort of spur-of-the-moment decision that I made upon actually seeing the beautiful facade of the building, and I am extremely glad that I took the tour! I can't say my tour guide was very informative - I managed to pick up a few scrambled facts about the building and the parliament - but I might chalk that up to the fact that it was a large tour and it was hard to hear with a few screaming toddlers in our herd. It might also have been the whole British accent thing. It was still very cool to be able to an important governmental building and be able to sit in the same chairs that representatives sit in, etc. The building itself is absolutely grand. I honestly thought it was much older than 19th century, perhaps medieval, but that just shows what I know about London history I guess! :)I grew up in St. Petersburg, which has a lot of impressive palaces with gilded walls and tons of sparkliness, but I honestly loved the Parliament house more. It has a very refined interior - Victoria's husband sure did know how to decorate. The food in their cafeteria isn't half bad either!"

Be prepared to be on your feet for 2 to 3 hours to take in the interesting history these awesome buildings hold. Security is high,however this is only to be expected. You will take a journey through the history of monarchs and politicians, the tour at times is extremely amusing of stories of pomp and ceremony of centuries past!!! I could not help but touch the stone walls as you can feel the history within them.The gift shop at the end of the tour (the English do this so well!!!!!) has some interesting items to purchase , well worth a nose around.I would not recommend this attraction for children under the age of 12. They would just not get the history."

She was more than interested as she was British. Even as an American, I loved it because I enjoy English history.Yes, security is heavy and no picture taking, so possibly plan on leaving your camera with the guard and any other electronic items. Or better yet, leave them in your room. Check the websites. But it's worth it. I bought my ticket online before I left and walked over from my hotel. And took my picture outside after I got my camera back. The other pictures of the Parliament buildings were taken in May 2005 when I walked in the area following a river cruise.Our guide was very knowledgeable and also acquainted us with the rules of the tour, what to expect - such as little to no sitting with certain exceptions. As one of the reviewers said,the first tour of the morning or the first in the afternoon is a good time. I also had tickets for the Royal Mews and the State Rooms. I learned later, it's necessary to schedule the royal tours on the same day and the tour of the Houses separately.I would like to take the tour again. And after reading some of the reviews, I know I would enjoy sitting in the galleries to hear the live action.Summer tours are only possible when the Houses are not in session and the Queen is in Scotland. Usually a period within August to September. As every reviewer has commented, it's a great experience for older children.It's one of those things you must do at least once."

Since I'm not from the UK, to see Parliament I needed to go on the group tour and I'm glad I did because it was excellent. You get tickets from the Jewel Tower building (I believe that's its name) located across the street from Parliament(on Westminster Abbey side). There's a Parliament sign. There is a small fee (not included in a London pass card if you have). I believe these tours are only open to international visitors in the months of August and September.Parliament is located on the Thames River and is a huge gothic styled complex of buildings and the base of the British legislative body. The tour of Parliament was about 90 minutes long. You see rooms affiliated with the House of Lords as well as the House of Commons. The British Parliament is divided into these two houses with a third being that of the British Monarch who still plays a significant role. The House of Commons is elected by the people while the House of Lords retains British history somewhat by being made up of British religious leaders and appointments due to the heredity of British titles. Our tour guide (Hugh) was very good and had a great sense of humor about British history, politics and royalty. We were not allowed to take photos inside Parliament except for the Westminster Hall which is all that is remaining from the original Parliament building which was devastated by the London fire. The Hall has an incredible wood roof that is the largest in northern Europe. This is also the Hall where most heads of state and royalty lie after their passing. Parliament was also hit during World War II and extensive renovations had to be conducted as a result but Westminster Hall remained somewhat untouched overall. During the tour, we saw the rooms were the Queen prepares to open each session. She has a ceremonial role in opening sessions and no bill becomes law without her signature. However, it is purely a ceremonial role at this point of history. This is explained on the tour. We also saw the small rooms where the House of Commons and the House of Lords meet. If you\u2019ve ever watched PBS, you will know what I\u2019m talking about. Those rooms where they are crammed in on top of each other arguing and debating. The Brits like it to be close because they feel it leads to better interaction and debate. There are also viewing platforms located above the rooms for the general public if they want to watch the debate live. Our tour was one dazzling room after another with the Lords side being a bit more royal looking with painted and guilded ceilings and the Commons side being a bit more \u201cplain\u201d with heavy use of wood paneling and single color ceilings. Both very pretty but in completely different ways. The House of Lords side is heavy in the color of red while the Commons side is heavy in the use of green. Both have their own meeting rooms. The Lords side meeting room has a number of portraits of former British kings and queens while the Commons side has statues of Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, etc. You can see pictures (that I couldn\u2019t take) at: http://www.parliament.uk/about/images/interior.cfmParliament is also home of the famous Big Ben. It also has some nice grounds which are open to the public and run along the Thames River. It was a very informative tour and I\u2019m so glad I was able to do."

Just back from a weekend away in London and have to say that one of the highlights was a visit to the house of Parliament.To arrange a visit you contact your local MP who will set it up for you. You received a permit throught the post allowing you entry which is free.After going though security you are allocated a tour guide who takes you around the various rooms. Once inside the building can only be described as stunning. Our tour guide was brilliant, very funny and had lots of history to tell us about the place. You are also taken into the houses of commons and Lords which was amazing to see. The tour takes around an hour and afterwards there is a little shop to buy merchandise and a well priced cafe.If your going to London do yourself a favour and arrange this trip in advance. It is well worth it. Even better if you go on a wednesday and can get into see Prime ministers questions."
