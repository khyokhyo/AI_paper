After hearing about the history of the square, it seemed the obvious thing to pay the \u20ac2.5 to visit the top of the tower.A lift takes you to the level of the clock mechanism and then you walk up a few flights of narrow stairs to reach the top.Your reward is a beautiful view over the square on one side and with the castle above and behind you. Very spacious up there and looked a lot less busy than the Santa Justa Tower which we could see from our vista.They could have improved the experience by giving more information about the clock and the tower in English.Certainly worth a visit."

From Rua Augusta you can see the statue and the river behind the arch. From Parco Commercio on the other side of the arch you look down the magnificent street. In the summer months, at night they have an amazing light show shown on the fa\u00e7ade of the arch and the building it's attached to. Now THAT is really spectacular but it doesn't run year around. There are a number of restaurants on the Parco Commercio so the arch is a fantastic setting for dinner (esp since it's lit up)."

We did the 48 hour Lisboa card, and this was one of the gratis options. Once at the top, you can also ring the bell and confuse all the tourists that have not benefited from going to the top of the arch. Enjoy the views !!"

The monumental arch is obviously visible from Pra\u00e7a do Comercio and Rua Augusta but you can now get tickets to climb to the top and take in the views. The tiny entrance is on the Rua Augusta side and easily missed as I never saw a queue there during our stay, probably as I never saw any advertising for it save for one website. Entrance is free with the Lisboa Card, otherwise entrance is \u20ac2.50 per adult which is pretty good value. The first part is accessible by a lift and the rest via the old spiral staircases which serviced the clock and other parts of the monument. Parts of the staircase can be dangerous for small children so make sure you're always holding on to them. Once at the top the parapet wall is high enough to ensure safety. Strollers must be left at the bottom by the ticket desk. There is a room on the way up where you can observe the clock's mechanism and there is limited interpretation. personally, I think it's a missed opportunity as it could include a lot more interpretation on the history of the arch, its construction and what it represents. The views at the top are brilliant. Some say you should see this instead of the Elevador de Santa Justa which also provides a brilliant view but its a different view so I'd still recommend you visit the Elevador in addition to the Arco. Overall a good value attraction which is yet to be discovered by the crowds. So shhh..."

There are people everywhere, and all of this creates such a lovely atmosphere when you go out for a walk to enjoy the day or the evening. It is absolutely charming. The Arch is a symbolic structure expressing the city's gratitude for their ability to survive and in the end triumph and prosper, after the 1775 devastating earthquake. It's a symbol of re-birth and at the same triumph over adversity. As the Latin inscription on the Arch states: \"The Virtues of the Greatest, that they may be a lesson to all, mark for eternity the grandeur of the Portuguese soul and its achievements throughout the ages\".

This monument was built to commemorate the city's recovery from the 1755 earthquake that devastated Lisbon. The arch was completed in 1875. From Rua Augusta, you see the backside of the arch which has a clock face surrounded by decorative relief. It is not as attractive from this location however, fromhere but you see the statue of King Jose I through the arch gap. This is nice for photographs. From the square you see the full spectrum of design that went into the arch's construction. Here you see six columns holding up the 30 metre tall structure, a relief of Portugal's Coat of Arms midway up the centre arch, as well as an allegorical arrangement of figures, three atop the centre arch which opens to Rua Augusta and one each upon the two side arches which form part of the walkway around the plaza at the north end.

In 1755, Lisbon suffered an earthquake who caused a Tsunami.Lisbon was devastated, the King fled to a tent and stood still terrified.Then, a man, a providential man, the Marquis of Pombal, both a dictator and a powerful organizer, rolled up his sleeves and got to work.He chose a wonderful team of architects, city planners and engineers and rebuilt, in few years, a new Lisbon.In the new main square - Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o - he built a 30m high arch symbolizing the triumph of the will and he didn't forget to carve his own statue...You can go by lift to the top and enjoy one of the most wonderful views of the capital, both towards the River Tagus and, opposite, towards Rua do Ouro."

The Arch of Augusta Street may be just a decorative arch / archway to some, but for many whether tourist or local longtime resident, the arch IS (next to or viewed behind the the equestrian statue of King Jose 1 in the centre of the massive waterfront public square that the arch way opens up onto) an amazing backdrop to the public square, an VERY IMPRESSIVE architectural element full of symbolism, an easy to find central meeting point is your group gets separated for any reason, AND also announces the entrance to either the amazing waterfront / riverfront open, historic plaza if you approach it from the north , OR opens onto introduces the foor of the amazing Augusta Street pedestrian open air shopping mall with it's amazing collection (wide mix) of retail shops - high end and tourist - and great cafes and restaurants.The arch is self is an extremely beautiful, picturesque, and symbolic classical style sculpture which acts as the central point of the historic architecture of buildings that surround the 3 sides of the amazing, wide open public plaza / water front square.The archway also acts as a central point of pick-up or drop-off for various means of public transportation - buses, trams, taxis / cabs, tuc tucs, segway tour groups, and even a meeting point for large group of travellers that arrive at the waterfront via the massive international cruise ships that dock nearby.(Google the arch to find out more important specific details of it's history and the symbolism of the various sculptures incorporated into it's design.Also on Saturdays and Sundays, the arch provides the focal point for an outdoor marketplace of better quality, genuine had crafted artists, craft makers, jewellry makes, etc. We actually stayed just a block away from the archway and public square, and visited the market several times over the weekend.All in all, the archway IS one of the main visual icons that represent and is photographed thousands of times a day for the central public square.Don't be turned off by the possible throngs of tourists. Take time to view and enjoy the artwork of the arch, and take in the ambiance of this central and historically important old world core of Lisbon. We went to and through the arch at all times of the day - and it always made for GREAT photographs and an amazing backdrop for family memories.Not to be missed!"

I try to climb to the highest buildings in all cities that I visit because the view is really great but some stairs are really scary.

As expected the views from the top of the Arco Triunfal are fantastic, but what made it an even more enjoyable experience was the relative ease you felt in getting to the top. Not only is it only a couple of Euro to go to the top, you enter through a very well managed entrance to a speedy lift which takes you most of the way up. This means that there is only a small amount of stair climbing to be done. They also have a clever traffic light system which allows visitors to indicate when they are coming up or down the steps, as they are only wide enough for one flow of people.That having been said, I would still definitely say that if you find walking difficult or get out of breath from a flight of stairs, that this is not the attraction for you (which is a shame).Once up there you can spend as much or as little time as you want admiring the remarkable views of such a beautiful city. Naturally it is a great place for photos, esp of Rua Augusta and Praca do Comercio."

Press the button and wait for the green light before ascending the first set of stairs (these are very narrow and so you can only go one at a time). After viewing the clock mechanisms and displays in the upper chamber, press the button on the upper set of stairs before ascending to the roof of the arch.

Being at the top of the Arco was excellent: one of three great views we enjoyed over Lisbon (the other two being the Castelo Sao Jorges and the Santa Justa Elevator).A lift takes you most of the way, then there are a few more flights of stairs. You feel very 'centred' at the top - after all, you are at the point where the Pombaline Baixa (the world's first modern city layout) meets the massive Placa de Commercio.You can ring a bell (at least, we think we were allowed!) and just soak in the views.There is a little bit of interpretation about the creation of the Arco one floor down - but a white font on a silver background isn't a great idea!"

In the daytime I think we might have missed it due to the crowds around the arch. The entrance is just under the arch on the right hand side as you are walking into the city. Entrance is cheap (a few euro), and a lift takes you most of the way up the arch. You then have to walk a couple of short flights of narrow stairs, but a good 'traffic light' system ensures you don't meet anyone coming the other way. The views from the top of the arch are wonderful and give you a different perspective from those traditionally found from the Santa Justa elevator, or from the various miradouros around town. This view lets you look up into the castle, and straight down the lovely patterned cobblestoned Rua Augusta"

Walking down from Rossio square towards the seafront, it is hard to miss. Vastly high yet narrow, it provides an obvious photo opportunity, especially after you cross into the open square beyond, by the sea (the Praca do Comercio.) We didn't realise you could ascend to the top of the arch, and didn't have time anyway, but according to other reviews, you can. This area is pleasant to walk around and is one of the touristy highlights. As for the rest of central Lisbon, well, it's just a shame about all the derelict and unkempt buildings, and all the graffiti everywhere. I hope Portugal begins to recover soon."
