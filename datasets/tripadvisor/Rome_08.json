We were just wandering when we came upon a small piazza where it appeared a wedding was taking place. My son said let's take a look inside the church it looks like other people are going in. So we went in and to our amazement we encountered the most beautiful ceiling fresco. This was by far one of our favorite places. Worth the effort to find."

We came here on a walking tour and was so taken aback with the stunning frescos and art work we came back again for a longer look around. we timed it right as there was to be a wedding a little later and we were able to witness a the small orchestra play a few pieces. All this added to the atmosphere of the visit. Definitely worth a visit."

We were absolutely blown away by what we saw! This was hands down one of the most beautiful churches we've been to in all of Europe. The ceiling was beautifully painted and gave the illusion of opening up to the heavens. To be honest, I think the artistry rivaled that of the Sistine Chapel. Plus, it had almost no one visiting so we had the place almost to ourselves. A definite \"must see\" if visiting Rome."

In such a beautiful city, it can seem like sensory overload, however please make time to visit and allow yourselves time to take in the sheer beauty and serenity of this church. We were en route back from visiting the Vatican ( and feeling a little sad as it was almost impossible to truly take in the beauty of the Sistine chapel because of the huge numbers allowed in at one time). Sant' Ignazio is a wonder, just overwhelmingly lovely, and what a joy to find contemporary works here too.Spend an hour here, it'll be one of the highlights of your trip."

However, as well as being free, not jam-packed and in a convenient place to access other attractions, it is beautiful.The artistry in the ceilings and on the walls is great and the famous model that took a bloke about 25 years to make is pretty interesting too.Definitely worth a visit - you can do it in 15-20 minutes and you're on your way to the next place."

What makes this one soecial is that St Ignatius lived here from1544 until he died in 1556. One will find his tomb, designed by Andrea Del Pozzo in the church. There are many examples of Baroque art throughout, but I believe the real importance of this church is the relationship to Saint Ignatius and his Jesuits."

I have visited all of the major sites, and this stands out in a good way for a few reasons:1) Free to enter - even during mass you can walk around quietly and enjoy the art;2) not busy at all - the total opposite of the Sistine Chapel;3) The artwork is simply incredible - vibrant frescos with perspective illusions and detailed sculptures.Give yourself at least 30 minutes inside to appreciate everything it has to offer."

The tardis effect of these buildings never ceases to amaze. A small door on a building in a labyrinth of streets opens into a massive, richly adorned celebration of eternal life. And so it was that we happened across St Ignatius. However, this one has a quirky feature. It was not permitted to build a dome. Undeterred, they have painted the appearance of a dome onto the flat ceiling. This isn't immediately obvious as you walk down the nave (which marks the point where the perspective is perfect), but once you stand underneath, it clearly looks wrong. But the imagination to do this brings a smile to your face. This is not the only feature of interest. The trompe l'oeil paintings on the ceiling of the nave are beautiful. And after expending all this artistic energy, the restaurant in the piazza outside is well worth a visit for lunch or dinner."

Stand on the special marble disc set in the church floor and all the perspectives fall into place. If you find it hard to look up there is a large mirror in the centre of the church which very adequately reflects the masterpiece without recking necks. Read about the fresco's meaning first, then make your visit."

They are the worse for it. It is perhaps the most beautiful church in the world that you can see up close. Grab a quick guidebook online, because the art is worth knowing about (in addition to just marveling at.) A neat added bonus for Catholic visitors: there were confessions on Sunday.Quick hint: the guys taking offering at the door do NOT work for the church. If you are inspired to leave an offering, there is a well-marked place inside."

The interior is entirely stunning - typically lavish for Catholic buildings, with beautifully painted walls, ceilings, chapels etc. Two extra attractions of note here are the stunning use of marble of all colours everywhere, and the main highlight which makes this cathedral stand out from others - the fake rotunda where the naves meet.Story has it that money ran out in the construction, so a flat roof was placed in the area where the cupola should be as a holding design - which never got replaced! It is worthy of note for the artistry on it. A fake perspective as been painted on it to make it look like a real rotunda is there. Of course, this view doesn't work everywhere - it is best walking down the centre of the nave, until you reach a star in the floor of the nave, where the effect starts to become less obvious.Definitely worth a look!"

And stare at the pillars and shuffle across the floor, keeping your eyes on the pillars and watch them move- they lean different ways when you move from one side to the other. These are just two of the many beautiful paintings/ art in this church.Oh- the other thing that blew her mind? The \"dome\" is not a dome but a flat ceiling but it looks like a dome.

If you love either one, you really ought to go see this church, hidden away quite near the Trevi Fountain. The use of perspective on the ceiling is really remarkable, not just in the much-talked-about false cupola but even more so in the rest of the ceiling. In addition, the side chapels contain some beautiful pieces--the Angels in the chapel of St. Luigi Gonzaga were my favorites-- that convey a real sense of the Jesuit mission as it must have been felt in the 17th century. If you make time for this, you won't regret it."

From the outside, it mimics the facade of St. Peter's Basilica, with its massive columns and larger-than-life letters boldly unscripted at the top front of the church. When one enters, you cannot help but be left open-mouthed by the spectacular 3-D ceiling, marvelously painted in trompe l'ceil technique by the 17th century painter Andrea Pozzo. If you stand at the center where you see a small gold disk, and look up, you will be amazed at how your eyes can be so deceived into seeing a continuous ascent into the heavens of so many characters, giving you a sense of endless open sky from where you stand. Take note of the man's finger's coming out of the window, the one right above the main door. Simply amazing! You look up and know just where the sistine chapel was inspired. Magnificent!"

There are a few larger Baroque churches in Rome where illusionistic tricks were used by the architects, sculptors and painters to thrill an audience. Sant'Ignazio is one of these churches. I was constantly staring at the vaults and domes trying to figure out whether I was looking at real space or painted space, sculpted figures or painted figures, etc. Doing this will make you giddy, and perhaps even euphoric!The largest ceiling painting is more-or-less in the central part of the church, and shows architecture reaching up to an open sky, with figures tumbling down into the church space. If you stand at a certain spot on the floor, you'll get the full effect---of infinite space! The same artist also painted a \"dome interior\" that looks like it's very high. If you look at it from a certain angle, it's surprising to see that it's quite shallow.The church is absolutely dripping with gold, silver, bronze, marble, stucco, etc. It's really difficult to isolate any single object. Everything is overscaled, which isn't to everyone's taste.This was the only church I was in where I saw the custodian at the door turn away some young women for inappropriate attire. Usually there'll be a supply of large shawls that could be given to women to cover up---but not here!"

I've been to Rome two times previously but, because of the wealth of sights and attractions, have never entered this place before. I was so glad that we went in and learned some of the history of the place, especially the story behind the amazing ceilings. Apparently, following uproar over the original public monies absorbed in the construction of the church that was more accessible by the wealthy, one of the priests, Ignacio, who was a talented mathematician came up with a budget price scheme to create a magnificant ceiling that wouldn't upset the people further. With clever use of perspective, he devised surface decorations that have created a remarkable three-dimensional effect that, to the ground level observer, appear to be ornate carving and stonework. I can confirm that these are truly remarkable and am not surprised that most of the churchgoers of that time were convinced of their authenticity and were perplexed to understand quite how the church afforded them without drawing on the public purse."

The wardens and volunteers were placing attractive artificial, metallic copper in appearance, for a temporary display about the need to care for nature - they asked my wife for advice on the placement of one of these!The roof is spectacular and has a viewing mirror for those who don't want a stiff neck.A peaceful, welcoming and refreshing break from the tourist crowds."

The reason to visit this church is the trompe l'oeil ceiling in the nave, making it look like there is a whole extra layer of architecture and height. To enhance the experience, there is a mirror placed near the best viewing point. Even the nearby dome is painted non-centric so to give the impression it is has a central opening if viewed from the nave. This church is close the to the Pantheon, and worth the detour."

This large Baroque styled church was built between 1625-50 following the canonization of St. Ignatius of Loyola in1622 and is located on the square bearing his name in the historical center of Rome. He was the founder of the Jesuits and is buried nearby at Chiesa del Gesu which is the smaller Jesuit mother church.The inside has attractive Corinthian pilasters that surround the whole interior. The entire nave ceiling has a spectacular fool-the-eye fresco that was painted by Andrea Pozzo. He also did the cycle of frescoes about the life of St. Ignatius in the broad eastern apse incl. the \"Siege of Pamplona\" where he gets wounded and \"St. Ignatius sends St. Francis Xavier to India\" recalling the aggressive missionary work around the world.The ceilings in the right and left transept are also painted by Andrea Pozzo. The side chapels all have richly ornamented altars. The tomb monument of Pope Gregory XV is situated in the chapel next to the presbytery. The large stucco statue of St. Ignatius was made by Camillio Rusconi in1728."

It is free to visit :)Wikipedia; The Church of St. Ignatius of Loyola at Campus Martius (Italian: Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola in Campo Marzio, Latin: Ecclesia Santi Ignatii a Loyola in Campo Martio) is a Roman Catholic titular church, of deaconry rank, dedicated to Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus, located in Rome, Italy. Built in Baroque style between 1626 and 1650, the church functioned originally as the chapel of the adjacent Roman College, that moved in 1584 to a new larger building and was renamed the Pontifical Gregorian University.[1] The most recent Cardinal of the Titulus S. Ignatii de Loyola in Campo Martio was Cardinal Roberto Tucci, S.J.; he had been its Cardinal Deacon until he became its Cardinal Priest (i.e., opted for the order of cardinal priests, with this church being elevated \"pro hac vice\" to title)."

It has two we especially liked - a false two-dimensional dome, which looks 3-D until you walk around underneath it, and a huge mural of St. Ignatius spreading the gospel to all the corners of the earth. The latter was full of detail, and we enjoyed picking out the representatives of the different areas, including Asia, Africa, Europe, and America. We enjoyed stopping in the church for about 20 minutes, appreciating the cool interior (it was a warm day) and admiring the paintings and their details."

The interior is quite awesome.The ceiling,by Andrea Pozzo (c.1685),is up there with the finest frescoes in Rome (and I've seen most of them). The sheer size of the place is also a surprise,given its relatively inauspicious exterior (although that is quite common with most of the City's churches). An added bonus to a visit here is a magnificent large wooden model of a church,on display near the main door,which on closer inspection consists of many smaller ones in a circular configuration around the larger one.In conclusion,your time here will be well spent."

The piazza in front appears to be the only one in Rome without a cafe/gelato shop! The inside is like many other churches in Rome, lots of chapels with lovely statues and paintings. But the thing here, I think, is the ceiling. Squint/blur your eyes a little, and you have trouble telling where the structural walls/columns end, and the painted ceiling begins. Stand about 25 feet into the church, in the center, then walk forward as you look at the dark dome behind the first, brighter dome. Or is it a dome at all? On your way out, look at the far left corner (near right corner as you come in). There is a wooden model representing all the cathedrals in the world. Very cool."

            "review": "Where you find Pozzo's masterful dome and ceiling fresco. Church of Sant'Ignazio di Loyola (free entry) is a lovely church to visit in Rome, most famous for its works by Jesuit brother Andrea Pozzo. Originally consecrated in 1722, this is a Baroque style building dedicated to the founder of the Jesuits Society, Ignatius of Loyola. Opening hours are 7am to 7pm daily. Here you can find plenty of ornate altarpieces, heavy gilding, stucco figures, marble pillars and other elements of Baroque and Rocco architecture. However, it is the works of Andrea Pozzo that excite us when it comes to visiting Sant'Ignazio di Loyola. To start with, the ceiling fresco called Trompe l'ceil of Sant'Ignazio is remarkable. Perhaps no other peer in Rome offers a richer 3 dimensional perspective, with angelic figures seeming to extend into an open sky and heavens with buildings towering above. It is a dazzling display of Pozzo's skill that is rarely matched and a real treat to look at and admire. As you walk a bit further into the nave, you soon encounter another of Pozzo's fantastic paintings, the illusionary dome fresco. From the centre position you can't help but think you are looking upward into an inner dome. Only after walking to the side and up close do you realise that you are simply looking at an illusionary style painting that has tricked your eyes, just as Pozzo had intended. This is a fun masterpiece to find and one you will long remember seeing after returning home from Rome. Do spend a bit time looking over the altar and the beautiful apse ceiling fresco as well. It is another gorgeous work by Pozzo. The rest of the church is quite impressive as well. However, it will be the works of Pozzo that you will long remember of your visit here.Note: There are many very good attractions in this area of Rome. You can easily combine a visit to Sant'Ignazio di Loyola with the likes of the Pantheon, Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Galleria Doria Pamphilj and others."

The Jesuits, who resided there, had one of their own priests, a mathematician Orazio Grassi, design the church. Andrea Pozzo, a Jesuit lay brother, painted the ceiling frescoes which are simply unbelievable. He painted them as a flat two dimensional surface but they look as if they were three dimensional raised frescoes. They are actually better that a majority of the church ceiling frescoes. The two dimensional painting of a dome that looks like a real dome is also a marvel. This church is a hidden gem in Rome. If you can, go and see it. It was one of the most affordable masterpieces of the city."

I hope you find it by chance before you find this review, but even if it doesn't get to take you surprise you should still go and go promptly. By the by, the salumeria and wine shop a few doors down does one of the best appertivo's in Rome (I can't remember the name now, but look at my other reviews, when I remember I'll do one for it.)"

The Tromp l'oeil by Andrea Pozzo SJ is something you have to experience first hand. Nothing I think can capture th efeeling of the effect of moving toward the bronze disk in the floor an watching the ceiling rise up to it 'full height'!!!!. Only thing I would add is that it would have been great to tour some of the hall ways leading to the Jesuit offices that Pozzo also painted.The side chapels are really interesting particularly the one to St Aloysius Gonzaga. Learning more about his family history and their importance in Europe has been great.Had the pleasure of attending the 2013 Christmas midnight mass there. While not understanding any of the Italian it was a wonderful experience.Actual visit December 2013"

From a mark on the floor you can best experience this illusion and see the \"dome\", which doesn't really exist - it is nothing but a large round canvas with the perspective picture of the dome that was supposed to be built there."

The ceiling is massive, taking up the whole nave (I think I got that nomenclature right). It's painted in such a way as to give the illusion of extending the architecture up into heaven through an open ceiling. To properly view the ceiling, look for a large dot built into the floor. It's painted from that perspective, so it works best from that angle. If you look at it from the back, it won't seem nearly as impressive. It's impossible to give the illusion from every vantage point. You'll know you're at the right place, because the false painted dome looks believable from there too. Take a few pictures. You might actually find that the lower parts of the painted architecture almost fool you when you look back at them."

Do take the guided tour, offered by volunteers, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, at 3pm. You'll learn some interesting facts about the Jesuit order as reflected in the artwork. St. Ignatius was never in this church, as it was completed in his honor 3 years after his death, but you will understand the wide appeal of his philosophy today."

He was the leader of the inquisition for the church. Take for instance the skull and cross bones and other related symbols on the floor, something we see even today. The medieval paintings and sculptures of him and the pope can relate his complete devotion to the papacy and thus he was thus rewarded with this church."

Well you have to go just for the ceiling and \"false dome\" painting. It is by the acknowledged expert in Trompe L'oeil, Andrea Pozzo (he later wrote books on the subject). My brain would not believe that it was actually painted on the flat."

Ignatius (founder of the Jesuit Society) probably would have been a bit uncomfortable with the lavishness and immensity of this building. The fresco ceiling gives the illusion of a dome....you must see to believe it. Colorful, symbol laden, take a seat and look--there's a lot to see. Probably the most beautiful church after St. Peter's. And it's free."

Yet another highly decorative Baroque church, the St Ignatius Jesuit church is memorable for its ceiling and the optical illusion within the church. The stunning frescoes on the ceiling represent St Ignatius being welcomed into heaven by Christ and the Virgin Mary. However, the really interesting thing about the church is the tromp l\u2019oeil dome. Stand in the right place and you will be completely fooled that this is a real dome within the church. There is a marble disk in the center of the church that you must stand on. Find it and you will get the complete intended perspective of the church and its ceiling fresco. The fake dome will appear real and the figures in the frescoes seem to acquire perspective as well, moving up toward heaven. Apart from that fascinating feature, the church is like many Baroque churches in Rome with highly ornamental alters, over the top gold gilding and coloured marble."

Built in the first half of the 1600's it contains marvelous frescoes and sculptures. The ceiling was painted by Andrea Pozzo and is wonderful to view from the marble disc in the middle of the nave as it creates an illusion of depth. To fully appreciate all to see in then church, I would advice Googling it for explanations of what you will see. I viewed the paintings and wondered how they could be executed all the way up to the very high ceiling."

If you stand in the centre of the nave and look straight up, it looks like the figures are floating in mid-air. Stand on the marble circle in the floor and the false dome looks perfect. But as you approach the chancel, you see the effect is completely an optical illusion created by false perspective in the painting. Church is free to visit; a few coins in the slot will illuminate the dome. Well worth your time."

You have to put this 17th century church on in the middle of your path as you must get inside to fully absorb what this Church offers - it usually closes at 7PM (as any other church) but worth Googling for it just in case.The strongest points are- no fees (as any other normal church!)- wheelchair access (very useful for the stroller) - the model of the \"Temple of Christ\", which doesn't have much info but seems to be a model containing references to all religions, bringing them into a kind of ecumenism. San Ignacio is the founder of the Society of Jesus (a.k.a. Jesuits) so anything related to Jesuits brings you to him.- the \"dome\", which is actually a 3D paint- the awesome ceiling frescoes painted by Andrea Pozzo (on the 17th century)- the peaceful you'll find inside the church, especially if you went to Sistine Chapel or San Peter's Basilica that are heavily crowded"

Even the smallest church seems to be rich with beauty and history so my rule quickly became 'If the door's open, walk on in.' I thought this church was quite beautiful and it reminded me a little of San Giovanni. This was one of those places that you can enter and immediately find relief from the hordes of tourists wandering around the Centro Storico. The church was surprisingly big, and had amazing ceilings. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. Price point: Free entry."

Once inside the efforts of architect Carlo Moderno and Orazio Grassi (who designed the facade) can not but create a sense of awe. The artwork of the apse and ceilings vaults are breath-taking examples of Baroque sentiments, great achievements by Andrea Pozzo. Note the marvelous trompe l'oeil that gives the impression that there is acupola on the church. There is none, but Pozzo makes us believe there is. Yes, it another ornate church in Rome.

After a day trawling round the Vatican and Sistine chapel I have to say Sant'Ignazio proved to be much more impressive! It's a gem that could be easily over looked on the typical tourist trail. Take time out to visit. Along with the Pantheon, it was a highlight for us."

The Church of Saint Ignazio of Loyola is beautiful in its own right and like many of the churches in Rome, it is an active place of worship with significant numbers of tourists taking time to meditate and pray in quiet reverence. But the church, while beautiful, is also a novelty with its faux dome painted by Andreas Pozzo, a Jesuit priest, when money ran out to provide a real dome. Another story is that the dome could not be built because it would have exceeded the height of the dome of Saint Peters and that was not allowed. I subscribe to the former because there are two finished domes in the church along with the faux dome.The artwork is so deceiving that not being aware of it, one might simply assume the dome is a real dome and not give it a second thought.While this church is named for Saint Ignazio, founder of the Jesuits, his remains are actually entombed in the Gesu Church a couple of blocks away though this church does house the remains of Pope Gregory XV.While it is certainly worth a visit, I was surprised to learn that this church is the #4 attraction in Rome, apparently far more popular than Saint Peters Basilica and the Pantheon, a block away, which ranks only at #9 and even though both have considerably more historical significance."

The most important place inside the church is probably the memorial for Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus. Since I'm a protestant I might not have a sense for Baroque and its golden splendour. However it's a good place to see the ecclesia triumphans of the Counter-Reformation and as it is a church that's not among the most watched in Rome, you should go there as well."

Others have reviewed the art I would like to approach from a different tack. We attended mass here on the Feast of the Epiphony, January 6th, traditionally the last day of Christmas. The experience was wonderful. The service was in Italian, which to our shame we do not speak, and yet the experience of mixing with locals and fellow travellers was humbling and inspiring. An enthusiastic organist played throughout the ceremony. The music and the wonderful surroundings made for a magical experience, spoiled only a little by the tourists who insisted in walking up the centre aisle during the service. I would ask people, whether believers or not, to respect that fact that such sights are sacred to many. Lovely church, convenient, and no reason not to enjoy a visit."

Sant'Ignazio church is located in the city center or Rome in a beautiful square (Sant'Ignazio) located between trevi fountain, via del corso and the pantheon (so it is a must walk for every tourist). There you would see a small and delicious square in which all the front buildings build a scenery, just in front of the big white facade of the church. When you enter this baroque church, you remain breathless by the richnnes of all the chapels and the big central nave. Then you watch up at the nave ceiling and you see a 3 D painted vault that goes up in the sky ..... The images are all painted but they are so valive and vibrant that they seem sculptures...... Some visitors don't even enter in this church which is more than a museum in itself and it is free.... Everybody line up to see the sistine chapel forgetting sant'Ignazio huge painted ceiling.Also the painted dome is a surprise.... it is painted as if it was a dome but it is a fake.... there is not dome in this great church.... but just a painted dome in a flat ceiling so another great surprise....."

My friend really wanted to go to a Church and we saw this one on our way to the Pantheon, so decided to have a look. To be honest I only agreed to go in as I needed the toilet and hoped there would be one inside (there wasn't but I didn't mind in the end).It was a free and quiet sit down away from all the hordes outside which was already a relief but this place was also quite beautiful in it's own way. I don't really like churches as I think they are a bit hypocritical spending all the money on ornate statues when they could have given it to charity and really made a difference but I had to concede this one was pretty nice even so. The thing that won me over though was that from the inside it looks like it has a big fancy dome in the roof but it has just been painted on!! You have to look closely to realise it is an optical illusion, way cooler than the Sistine chapel.. and free!"

The external architectural style may not be as catching to the eyes as some of the most notorious churches and basilicas of the Citta Eterna, but the interiors are truly a remarkable statement of artistic creation and spiritual uplifting. A perfect statement describing the spirituality of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the humble and yet so powerful intellectually and spiritual charged founder of the Jesuits order. Having studied with the Jesuits I have a particular attraction to this architectural masterpiece. When visiting, please sit quietly for few seconds before raising your eyes to the cupola and admire the magnificent architectural structure and affrescos. I suggest some reading about the church before visiting or while there in order to truly intake al. The beauty of this masterpiece and the meanings of the spirituality of St. Ignatius."

It is built in the no-holds-barred gold-on-gold Baroque style. Check hours during summer months, as the church may close earlier in August (for holidays). Anywhere else in the world, the Sant' Ignazio would be mobbed with worshippers and tourists. It is indicative of the myriad splendors of Rome that this church is free to the public and usually sparsely visited, even at the height of tourist season. The main reason to visit is to see the awe-inspiring tromp-l'oeil frescoes in the ceiling, painted by Andrea Pozzo in response to the Baciccia frescoes at the Basilica Il Gesu. The frescoes depict the optical illusion of saints and angels ascending to the sky alongside marble columns. These three-dimensional illusions were painted onto shallow domed ceilings---an artistic trick when architectural budgets were constrained. The saints ascend along painted marble columns to heaven. Animals and people from around the world are depicted: jaguars, horses, crocodiles. They are enormous and the message is unmistakable: Christ tames all. The domed ceiling at the nave can be illuminated for 0.50 Euro (the coin). There is also a marvelous and beautiful model near the entrance of the church of various ecclesiastical buildings around the globe. Truly a beauty. You will not be disappointed."

Now look up and you will see the secret. The nuns across the way objected to a dome being put on the church so, respecting their wishes, they didn't build one.

Ignazio di Loyola is rated very high on Tripadvisor and so we finally visited it with friends recently in Rome for the first time as the third church we took them to (on the way to the Pantheon which is close). It is indeed a unique, large church that may introduce you to illusionary ceiling and dome paintings (it is not the best at this technique, but impressive nonetheless). It is impressive on size, scope and style, and the ceiling does pull off looking like it is much higher than in reality; yet the people figures only partially come across as intended. the enclosed picture does not capture its beauty, but you can get the idea.

The Andrea Pozzo painted ceiling is actually painted on a flat surface, but the illusionistic perspectives make the figures seem to be soaring into the heavens, or about to fall out of the clouds, on a ceiling that looks to be about 60 feet higher than it actually is. Also do not miss Pozzo's dome (or \"dome\"). It can illluminated with a coin, but the coin machine was broken when we were there. Still, go stand under it and study it until you see the next illusion. The church is large and feel air conditioned in summer. It is not as crowded as most significant churches, and has pews where you can rest, meditate, make notes in your notebook, or look up at the Baroque paintings. The ceiling is frescoed (painted right onto plaster); the dome is done in oil. Saint Ignazio (Ignatius) was the founder of the Jesuit order. This church is a 3 minute stroll from the Pantheon."

Stand on the centre (yellow) circle and NOW look up and, as other reviews suggest, move about a bit to get the strange effect of the roof \"changing shape\". No mirrors, just a quirky artist! If you get a chance to hear the organ or a choir signing then you'll get a big bonus; the \"4 second echo\" is very evocative and moving, as if the chuch itself does not want to let the sound go. This church makes some of the overblown relics in this city pale into insignificance, see it for yourself, it's a \"Top ten\" attraction!"

The Church of Saint Ignatius of Loyola (Chiesa di Sant 'Ignazio di Loyola a Campo Marzio) has one of the most beautiful interiors throughout Italy. With its construction started in 1626 and finished 25 years later, is dedicated to the founder of the Jesuit order. A jesuit brother, Andrea Pozzo, was invited to paint the frescoes on the ceiling of the nave and created a true masterpiece that leaves visitors speechless with so much beauty. Based on the text of Luke, dealing with subjects about fire and light, observers have the feeling that the figures are flying in the open sky, or even falling over them. In the center of the church, there is a circle of marble on the floor, from where you have a better perspective and where the illusion caused by the images, become almost real. Four continents are represented, besides himself Ignacio de Loyola being received by Christ and the Virgin Mary in paradise. This church is not the best known in Rome, but to aficionados for good art is a must visit."

It is not bigger nor more beautiful than many others, but the key attraction is the painting on the ceiling. It is a trompe l'oeil depicting the skies opening up allowing Saint Ignatius to ascend into Heaven, being welcomed to Jesus and Virgin Mary. The ceiling is actually a barrel-shaped one, but the fresco (by Pozzo) gives the impression of a multitude of columns and vaults on top of each other, above which the saints and angels hover among the clouds.A marble disc in the floor mark the exact point from where the fresco should be watched. Immediately you move away from here, some of the columns will start leaning to one side. If watching from one of the corners of the nave, the entire perspective becomes totally false.There is a second fresco in the church, giving the impression of being a dome. But it is very dark and needs renovation. It is by no means as impressive as the main one. The location of the church is very central in Rome. It is very close to ther Pantheon in the direction of the Trevi Fountain."

San Ignazio has so many things to offer the visitor, but the two I take young people to see (especially if it's a sunny day) are the ceiling and the dome. The HD/3D ceiling is stunning, with characters leaping everywhere and so much movement it's hard not to get dizzy. After craning their necks for a few minutes, I then take visitors to see the dome. Visitors look up at the dome and say \"so what\"? The \"so what\" in this case is that the dome is fake. It's an optical illusion drawn very carefully by the artist. Even after telling visitors this, they take a while to get their eyes not to lie to them. That's the fun.As I said, there is so much more to this counter reformation masterpiece, but for the casual and time constrained visitor, this is enough."

There are hundreds of beautiful churches in Rome, that this one is especially unique. From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but from the inside it is spectacular! The ceiling frescoes have so much depth and clarity. The figures look like they are actually projecting off of the ceiling. But the most amazing part of the church is how they expanded limited space. You will notice that the church looks much bigger inside than it does from the outside. And this is all due to optical illusions, the trompe l'oeil, effect. The dome, from the point of entrance to the center of the church looks very believable. It isn't until you are standing directly under it, when you notice something is off. It is an illusion painted on a flat ceiling. NO dome at all! It is even more amazing to think about how the effect must have been hundreds of years ago, with no artificial lighting. And to think how the calculations of perspective must be right on to attain such an effect. After visiting this church, you will be more inclined to really \"look\" at your surroundings. You might start seeing the entire city from a different angle..."

It is almost impossible to believe that the ceiling is actually flat. The windows which let in sunlight are - obviously - real but everything above is a trick created by skillful use of perspective. He has painted in another layer of windows, columns and archways with the illusion of incredible space and light. Exuberant angels, saints and cherubs accompany St Ignatius as he is bathed in celestial light and transported to heaven.Pozzo has also painted a false dome which entirely fools the eye until you move from the designated point on the floor and the perspective shifts to reveal this to be another illusion. It is incredibly difficult to imagine how he envisioned and executed this with such skill. In its own way it is as amazing as the ceiling in the Sistine Chapel."

The dome especially needs to be appreciated from this perspective. Once you deviate off the path the perfect symmetry distorts. The dome truly looks real until you move off the line. Brother Pozzo, was not merely a great artist his painting was designed to serve a spiritual message: it is only when you remain on the straight path that you really see things as they are. Stray off and your perspective becomes distorted!"

We walked from our hotel to the king of Baroque churches called St. Ignacio, the Romans call this the 3D church because the artist Pozzo painted a fake dome which looks very much like a dome if you are standing in the proper place to see it. Its very cool, moving through the church you see it become distorted and even then it is something to behold. As you enter the church you see it in the center of the main building and as you approach it, it becomes more and more visible as a dome. You have to stand in the proper place to really see it, look at the floors for a clue as to where to stand. This church is painted very much like the Sistine Chapel with biblical scenes rising up the walls and onto the roof of the church. Don't forget to turn on the lights of the dome, they really illuminate it well and it only costs one euro.

The ceiling contains a Fresco which shows Saint Ignazio ascending to heaven. The special feature of this is the perspective. The painting has been put onto the building so make it appear as if the church ceiling is a portal to paradise. The paint uses the beams and columns in the corner of the room to its advantage and its a wonder how angels and characters can cover more than one surface and still maintain their 3D effect.There are other sections to this but I cannot explain them well enough, I would strongly recommend this to anyone in Rome; for me it rivaled the Sistene Chapel.

It is magnificient!! The reds and the fresco's are stunning... It is just like opening a closest and thinking you would find nothing and you open the door to this church and its just magical.. A beautiful place to visit."

Often one frequently hears about the Gesu church, but as far as Jesuit-themed counter reformation temples go, this one is stunningly beautiful too. I came here during a concert and got to see the place lit up at night. The paintings over the altar and on the ceiling (which includes an interesting geography lesson so to speak) are what really set this place apart for me and others I'm sure. If you're in the area, I think stopping by for a few minutes would definitely be a worthwhile idea."

He even showed us Internet photos of them and had prepared us for the magical dome inside Sant'Ignatio. When we walked down the nave however, I still thought I was looking at the real deal- until I walked down to the altar. What a whimsical surprise! And no tickets or long lines to enter, either!"

I really liked the paintings and decorations. Then I decided to go to the Church of the Gesu, the world HQ of the Jesuits, and it blew my mind!! So go to both, they are really not to be missed in Rome."

            "review": "Superb illusionary ceiling and dome paintings in Sant' Ignazio di Loyola. This Baroque era church is fascinating for the illusionary dome and ceiling painting put in place here by Andrea Pozzo, a master of optical illusion painting during his time. The reason for this was due to the church being completed without a dome back in 1685. The dome illusion painting near the altar is most impressive. When you view it from the front, it honestly appears like the inside of dome structure. You can only tell it is just an optical illusion (slanted painting) after you walk around to the side to see how the shapes take form. Further, the main nave ceiling painting is of the same nature. With a deceptive upward painting that is very beautiful to view, a unique find in the centre of Rome. We also enjoyed the nicely painted and decorated chapel, statues and wall murals found within the church, classic Baroque era stuff, some of the best on display in Rome. We enjoyed the interesting circular model of world churches found near the entrance of the church. It was fun spotting those we have been lucky enough to have visited as well as those that remain on our long list of places to visit and those we were not yet even aware of. Much remains to be learned it seems. Lastly, there is a small but creatively designed piazza directly in front of Sant'Ignazio Di Loyola that is quite attractive to look at before or after visiting the church. In addition to this lovely church and piazza, you are very near to the very good Santa Maria sopra Minerva church and the important Pantheon attraction amongst many others. Combined you can easily fill the better part of \u00bd or \u00be of a day in sight-seeing in this central part of Rome. Overall, we really enjoy Sant'Ignazio Di Loyola first because we are slightly biased towards Baroque churches but mainly this one scores so high because of the illusionary ceiling and dome paintings inside that are unique for Rome and very fascinating to look at."

If you stand on the steps of the church and look around the square, it's like being in an opera scene. Inside the church, as you walk center aisle, keep looking at the ceiling. At a certain point you will see that the cupola or dome starts to slide. That's because it's not a dome. It's flat and the Jesuit painter Del Pozzo painted a trompe l'oeil or optical illusion. He did the same thing at the Jesuit church in Vienna, Austria, which also has a flat room. This is a nice place to take children. Also frequently free concerts take place here. You have to look at wall posters plastered around the neighborhood to see when they take place. Often the musicians come from the USA."

What I am referring to is the tiny confessional to your left as you face the main altar, near the front of the church. It is a memorial to a sweet ( just look at his picture) parish priest who sat there listening to Romans and others tell him of their faults and fears and hopes. He must have been a wonderful man. Just look at the markers giving thanks. I won't give you his name. Find that out for yourself and spend a quiet moment there. You will not regret it no matter what your faith or none."

I would never try and take anything away from the genius of Michelangelo and the magnificent ceiling in the Sistine but truly I am just as taken with Pozzo's ceiling at St. Ignazio. The entire church is an often missed masterpiece. I have been going to Rome since 1973 and only first visited the church in 2010. Please note the small brass circle on the floor near the center, it gives the best vantage point for viewing. It is very easy to find just a block from the Pantheon."

Having seen the sistine chapel the following day, I feel this church's ceiling is far superior in its splendour. Only out-done by the Basilica at the Vatican, why is this church not publicised more ?"

Outside of the Vatican & the Pantheon, there are a number of equally significant and beautiful churches to visit while in Rome. This is one of my favorite I have visited twice. This Baroque church has an entirely different atmosphere from the other architectural styles in Rome. Only a few blocks from the Pantheon and sometimes easy to miss, but be persistant and find you way. The frescoed ceiling is so colorful and it lights up the entire interior. There is actually a marker on the floor where you are to stand to view the faux dome that looks so real, it's hard to imagine that it's just a painted illusion. The interior is richly decorated in the baroque style and gives the church a feeling of being even larger than it is.On my trip through Italy this was my 2nd favorite church that I would go back and see over and over again."

St Ignazio is another monumental baroque church in Rome (built between 1626 and 1685), but what I specially like in this one, more than the tomb of St Luis Gonzaga, are the fresques by Andrea Pozzo on the ceiling, so raise your head, look up and admire the cascade of colors that fall over you when you stand under the fresques. The \"trompe-l'oeil\" perspective is magnificent."

We walked in, having no idea what to expect and wow, i cant imagine why this amazing church is not advertised more!Phenomenal, i cant praise it enough. The architecture, the ceiling and wall paintings, it must rival the sistine chapel, we were in awe of all that there was to see. I cant imagine how it is for the people who go to church here. So grand and the detail is never ending! Statues and arches, gorgeous walnut confession booths, everything! I seem to be having problems posting photos but if i get the chance i will submit them. This amazing place is a piece of art and history and shouldnt be overlooked or missed on a trip to Rome! by the way is also called saint ignatius of loyola built about 1620 and you could find it on google for pics and directions"

The church is very large, with a beautiful arched ceilling on which is painted the ascension of St. Igantius Loyola into heaven. There is also quite a wonderful trompe 'loeuil dome further along, before one reaches the sumptous altar. Side chapels off the naves also contain their own points of interest.The wonderful thing is that all the visitors when we were there were respectful of the fact that this was a church and so there was no chattering going on (albeit there being a fair number of people). This added to the spiritual feeling within the church.As written earlier, the piazza in front of the church is also worth viewing because of its unique architectural construction. My husband, who lived in Rome, explained that it is acoustically perfect and that in the summer months they often close off the small openings and the side and hold concerts without the need for any amplification system."

The trompe-l'oeil ceiling is absolutely beautiful and amazing! The dome as well is a masterpiece of trompe-l'oeil, with sunlight \"streaming and all, realized by Andrea Pozzo in 1685. Make sure you check the opening times since it closes for lunch..."

I found about this church in a Lonely Planet article it had a picture of it's amazing ceiling with several frescoes, later we found out it was a 5 minute walk from our hotel. Since we didn't get to see the Sistine Chapel we were quite happy to see this one. The frescoes are amazing, there is not a lot of people so you can see it peacefully. A wonderful surprising and one of the top churches I have seen!"

Our tour guide made a stop here and we were delighted with what we saw.If you are an artist or fan of art, check out the ceiling of this church. When the church was built, they did not have the funds to complete it with a dome. Later, they had the funds, but the powerful neighbors refused to allow them to build it, so they hired an artist named Pozzo to pain a faux dome on the ceiling. There is a spot on the floor under it where you get the impression you are looking up at a dome. The perspective effect is amazing.There are tremendous frescoes to be seen.St Aloysius Gonzaga is interred in an urn of lapis lazuli."

The facade is in a simple courtyard, but the inside hold the real treasures. Looking up is more important than straight ahead. The trompe l'\u0153il ceiling by Andrea Pozzo is the same calibur work as the frescos in the Vatican museums.The several different kinds of inlaid marble in the columns, floor, and chapels are unparalleled by anything else I've ever seen. During my limited and precious time in Rome, I came back to this church again and again. It really is that breathtaking. Look at my pictures to see for yourself."

It is an amazingly beautiful church which is open to the public, but not terribly crowded with tourists. The paintings on the ceiling are amazing and, in my opinion, were just as beautiful as the Sistine Chapel. It was definitely worth the time to have a quiet stop to enjoy, and not be constantly herded around. It is closed in the early afternoons, as are many churches, so be aware."

I sought refuge in the immediate proximity of the church and lo and behold, here I stood speechless inside the magnificence of the unsuspectedly large church! Who would have known about this treasure here? I have seen many churches and cathedrals in Italy and France and there always is one that is going to surprise you, one that you haven't heard about yet.Thanks to the Lord and the rain I got to see this gem...if you pass this way, it is worth a stop!"
