We had been living in the castle area for the visit and had seen the church from the outside on a number of occasions. Stunning building and equally as impressive inside with a very unique window and a great tour. It costs to go in but its definitely worth it."

It's a Gothic architecture and a Roman catholic church. It's stunning from the outside with decorated ceramic tiles on the roof tops and decorated sculptures on its buildings. On the inside you will admire the hand painted walls and ceilings. It has very beautiful stained glass windows. One has to see to admire this majestic building. This is a MUST SEE attraction and definitely worth a visit while at the BUDA side."

This wonderful and architecturally superb church stands overlooking Fisherman's Bastion and the River Danube below in the heart of Buda's Castle District. With origins from the eleventh century the mainly fifteenth century structure was massively refurbished in more recent years, 1950-1970's with some much needed work following damage during world war two. This Roman Catholic institution has fast become one of Budapest's most treasured sights and stands firmly on the must see list when visiting the city. I found it to be exquisite and alluring. It wasn't open for some reason the afternoon we visited but the beauty from the outside can clearly be seen. I love the roof. It is also clearly part of the Castle district skyline from the River Danube and cannot be missed when taking one of the many river cruises. A great part of this wonderful city."

What a beautiful place! We visited in October and noticed that there were LOTS of groups taken there as part of their tours, so we visited the church early. The inside is honestly breathtaking, very ornately decorated. There is a balcony are that you can visit too with only a few steps to manage. TIPS for visiting the Fisherman's Bastion - you will be charged if you visit in the daytime, but in the evenings the barrier (well, someone on a chair!) is removed and you can walk around the upstairs part free of charge. You lose any daytime shots looking over the river (towards Parliament) but the night time shots are just as stunning as all the monuments and bridges are lit up. While in the area it is easy to walk round and find the other nearby attractions (Hospital in the Rock/History Museum etc) Would choose to stay there again if we are lucky enough to visit again."

After seeing more cathedrals and abbeys than I care to count, this one is entirely different. It owes this to the period when the Ottoman Empire took control and converted it into a mosque. When Christians returned, a great deal of the Moorish influence in the wall painting remained.Take a little extra time and take in the free museum. Worth the views from the second floor of the museum looking back into the cathedral."

Our most memorable aspect was the steeple climb, all 200+ steps.

Forget the Fisherman's Lookout and opt out for the steeple."

It was built in the latter half of the 13th century on the site of a church destroyed by the Mongols in 1241. The tiling on the roof is quite spectacular.It is a busy place set in a square and part of the old city of Buda which contains many very picturesque old buildings. There is much more to see here than just the church.The square also contains a Plague Monument typical of the period which was erected as thanks for the passing of the plague and in the hope that the plague would not return."

Because it has been both a church and a mosque, the building's interior had a unique flavor of both. The walls almost look like they are molded from tapestries, but in fact, it's amazingly detailed paint job. It was about $5 fee for the entrance to the 14th-century church, named for King Matthias. We just walked up and bought tickets for both the church and the Fisherman's Bastion, which is right next to it. The upstairs of the church houses a nifty little museum with details about the church and the restoration. We were also lucky to catch choir practice during our visit, which was really lovely."

This is one of the most historically fascinating buildings in Europe, and while it looks like yet another Gothic church on the outside, it is inside that is so amazing. The only church to survive the Turkish invasion and occupation, it was converted into a mosque, decorated with Islamic art and the Christian icons painted over. When Budapest regained its independence, some of the icons were restored and most of the Islamic art retained, so the Matthias Church is an everlasting monument to its history.Beautiful stained glass, incredible wall art, and a knockout location on the hill overlooking the Danube, this is one of the most stunning gothic churches you will ever visit."

There are no audio guides or tours so be sure to have your guide book with you to identify all the highlights of the church. You can climb the bell tower but it was 200 steps and we decided not to do it. They charge for entry into the church, for the bell tower and for the fisherman's bastion. You can pay for each one separately. Plan on spending about 2 hours to take it all in. There is a very famous old cafe down the street from the church and I have attached a picture to the review.

Regarding the church, it's quite impressive. The decoration/painting is on all around the wall. They also have many relics, monstrance, many historical things with good maintenance and information.

Be sure to find where you can walk up a staircase to a gallery where you can look down on the altar area for some good views as well as see some exhibits about the church.

The inside is really beautiful with several side chapels as well as the huge main alter piece.If you want to visit the main bell tower there are organised, supervised groups. A couple of guides make sure you all get up and back down.

Predominant colors inside are red, gold, and brown. Lots of gold leaf in huge wall paintings (directly on the walls) telling religious stories. 500 year old carvings on the southern entrance. Side altars beautifully decorated as is most of the left side of church. All effect is extraordinary neo-gothic building. Matthias was King and Saint. Church is stunning at night where blue tint invades a prominently yellow/white presence. Extraordinary"

The interior really is both surprising and stunning. I am not keen on places of worship in general but the interior of this church is a sight to behold - virtually every inch of the interior is decorated with patterns and flowers painted (with stencils) directly onto the stone walls - I have never seen anything quite like it. I believe it is also possible to ascend the tower but having already been up the tower of St Stehpen's Basilica and onto the roof of the Castle art gallery I gave this one a miss especially as the view from the Fisherman's Bastian over to Pest was spectacular.

The designs were Middle Eastern with colorful hues that are mindful of Morocco. The building is in the Castle District and is high on the hill of the Buda side. If you get the opportunity visit Matthias Church. It is much different than many of the church buildings you will see in Europe."

            "review": "Originally built in 1015AD. Matthais Church is located in front of Fisherman\u2019s Bastion, and is in the heart of Buda Castle District. Church tradition suggests it was originally built in Romanesque style in 1015AD, though no archaeological remains exist. The current building was constructed in the florid late Gothic style in the second half of the 14th century and was extensively restored in the late 1800s. WWII brought the church to near ruin, and it was again restored. One of the most distinctive aspects is the colorful tile roof. The slender profile makes the building seem much taller. The admission fee is well worth the experience, but as with all iconic buildings in Budapest\u2014especially those on Castle Hill\u2014I recommend an early visit. Throngs of tourists populate Buda Hill making a peaceful visit difficult."

The white stone with beautiful decorations makes it truly majestic. If you want to you can pay an entrance fee in a ticket office located just next to the church and access a viewpoint in the tower which offers a fantastic view over the city. If you don't want to do that a look on the outside is just as good!"

All the columns, the ceiling and every inch of the church is painted in understated beautifully muted colors. There are Turkish, Art Nouveau and Hungarian motifs that all combine into a harmonious whole. Unlike the heavily gilded baroque churches that after a while begin to melt into one another you will not forget this Church as there are no others like it, at least not any I have seen.It is closed to visitors during religious services and there is a small fee for visitors when it is open. If you attend Mass you can enter for free. Concerts are often held in the church and we attended a beautiful Kodaly Mass on a Sunday in June.

During the second World War, the German troops used the church as a stable for their horses and it needed much reconstruction after the war. The roof is covered with colourful tiles from the Zsolnay factory in southern Hungary. There is an entrance fee for visitors mainly to help with maintenance but entrance is free for disabled visitors and church services (Mass). It is a Roman Catholic Church. The interior is richly painted reminiscent of an eastern style, almost like a mosque. During the Turkish invasion, there was a mosque and the statue of Mary was walled up. The wall collapsed during prayers and when the statue of Mary appeared the Turks fled. The church is a place of pilgrimage."

            "review": "Stunning, breathtaking, eye candy so paying the entry fee was OK. I spent 1 hour inside this church because there was so much to admire, not only on the main floor of the church, but, also, upstairs for views looking into the apse area, for displays of copies of the crown and coronation jewels, and for the statue of Empress Elizabeth with her head carved so beautifully. The admission fee covered all interior areas. Note that on Sundays, paying visitors are allowed in at 1pm.I usually balk at paying an entry free to a church, but once inside I felt the fee was very worthwhile. Note that seniors pay a reduced entry fee. The booth for this payment was located on the side of the square and it saved time paying in HUF rather than by credit card. Attendants spoke English. The ticket was taken by gentlemen at entrance to the side door of the church so no sneaking in. The exit was at another side door of the church which also was \"guarded\". The first thing that I noticed when I entered the church was the use of painted or tiled colored patterns to cover every surface - the floor, the walls, the clustered columns, the rib vaulting and the ceiling spaces between the ribs. The 2 sections of benches in the nave were a solid brown, however, as was the carved and canopied pulpit. At first glance, the decor was rather overwhelming, but breathtaking at the same time. The patterns varied from swirls to naturalistic elements and reminded me of Moorish design, but were replicas of Hungarian design taken from a manuscript. The design emphasis it seemed was not religious figures or stories - that was the role of the stained glass windows done in a long rectangular Gothic shape and the gilded altars.I almost missed the Loretto Chapel at the very back of the church in a dark corner, because my attention was drawn to the apse and the nave decor. Again the chapel room was painted with much pattern - beautiful blue spaces between the rib vaulted ceiling - but the focus of attention was meant to be the Madonna statue which had been discovered hidden in the church's walls for protection from invading armies. When an explosion revealed the statue, the invading army felt defeated and retreated Buda. Unusual for a church was the side staircase that led to a balcony with a view over the apse with its altar, choir stalls, and an opportunity for very close up views of the stained glass windows placed around the apse. Another balcony offered closeup views of the vault ribbing decor and the nave below.Other narrow stairs led to rooms that held the replicas of the Hungarian crown and other coronation jewels, religious regalia, and my favorite, the sculpted statue showing the beautiful face of Empress Elizabeth. The church was also very beautiful from the outside with stone carvings over the 3 doors and on the main tower spire. I did see the raven sitting on a golden ring on one of the narrower spires, but it was the eye catching colored diamond pattern of the roof tiles that caught my eye. Not often is aqua used as an accent color in such tile work. The skilled carvings at the top of the spire on the main tower gave it a delicate filigreed effect. These details were hard to see from the square on which the church stood - use a zoom lens camera. Beside the church is the Fisherman's Bastion with its views of Pest, particularly the Parliament building which is directly across it. A stairway leads down to walking paths which lead the way down the hill/to other stairs to the town at its base. The church is located on a square that is about a 15 minute walk from the square where the funicular and Buda Castle/art gallery are located. It didn't matter to me that St. Matthias Church was newly renovated and that the interiors weren't original. St. Matthias Church was one of the most memorable churches on my Amsterdam to Budapest river cruise."

You can buy admission to three things at the ticket window, Fisherman's Bastion, top of the church and go inside where they were doing a small concert where you can sit a rest for a while if you are waiting to go up. I go to the highest place in a city I can find and this is it for Budapest. It's 200 steps to the top, no elevators like St. Stephens, so if you can't do steps, don't bother buying a ticket, but if you can, it's the greatest view of the city. You don't want to miss this place."

We were here for a short and photo-stop visit after visiting Gellert Hill earlier on. And it was so crowded with visitors, both local and foreigners.This renowned Matthias Church is one of the oldest buildings in Budapest with more than 700 years of history and it's frescoes were done by famous Hungarian painters. Our guide gave us a detailed and interesting explanation of its history dating back centuries ago, its transformation and how it returned as a Catholic Church eventually!From the view afar, the church looks grand and magnificent. When we came closer, it was so massive and looked more beautiful and awesome. We were particularly impressed with the gothic with renaissance architectural designs and reminded of the ones we have seen in UK and France.Well, you need to buy a ticket to enter the church where you will have a chance to go up to the tower with a great paranomic view overseeing the city. There was already a long queue of visitors waiting to enter.As we did not have much time here because we were on a walking tour in the city, after staying here for a while (including a visit to the Fisherman's Bastion (which is just next to the church that also offers a bird eye's view on the entire city, which I will review it here separately and do stay tune) and Heroes Square etc, so it was with regret that we didn't have the chance to enter it.However, the feeling was great to see such lovely historical buildings and the city!Recommended."

Unusual brightly tiled roof, rebuilt post war.Excellent access when inside to angles and elevations of the church which let you appreciate the unusual painted interior.Several historic and unusual artifacts / treasures also to ponder over, Stayed longer than we had anticipated and enjoyed it very much. Did not pay to go up the tower, minimal cost of entry which was well worth it."

It is a beautiful building from the outside, but do not stay outside. Inside, every inch is gloriously hand-decorated with stenciled designs. The stained glass windows are stunning. The history will bowl you over, from the first Christian king, to the Hapsburgs to the armies who dared to use it as a stable for animals. The way it looks today you would never guess the stable part, but it's just one chapter in an amazing tale. Do not miss this!!"

You can buy two separate tickets (bell tower and main church) at the booth to the right of the church, and you can also buy one for Fisherman's Bastion (a stone's throw away) at the same time. The bell tower gives an amazing view, and though there are stops along the way there is no lift, and it's a long climb up a narrow stair case. We had a great tour guide too, who gave us everything from the history of the building to restaurant recommendations!"

Completely unexpected from the Baroque architecture on the outside.

I was very impressed by the Byzantine painting, that makes the church very colourful in comparison to other Catholic cathedrals. The outside is also very impressive, especially the contrast between the white rock and the coloured roof. However, I was extremely disappointed by the staff's attitude concerning the dress code. Outside, at the ticket office, there is no notice about any dress code. I went in wearing trousers and a decent top, with bare shoulders, and I was requested to put on a scraf (they had it there). There were a lot of people waiting to go in and, as I was surprised with the request, I did not say anything. However, I find this quite disturbing for an occidental country! I do not know if this is the policy or it was just some overzealous catholic member of the staff... It was the first time that anybody asked me to cover my shoulders in a church! Moreover, there was no mass at the time, so nobody praying could be disturbed by the bareness...By the way, earlier in the same day we entered Saint Stephen's Cathedral during the mass and nobody had any problem with the bare shoulders. After one week, I am still outraged by the request! I only met this kinds of requests in some monasteries in eastern Romania but, even there, they had a problem only with skirts that were too short, never with tops! I am very surprised to have found such a medieval approach to clothing in Europe!"

This stunning Gothic edifice has been an integral part of Hungarian history and in consequence, has suffered the ups and downs of the nation as a whole. The current building was designed in the late 13th century, on the site of a previous church attributed to St. Stephen, the first king of Hungary. Over the centuries, and because of its proximity to the Royal Castle, the Church was the site of coronations, royal weddings and funerals. During the century and a half of Turkish occupation it became the principal mosque of the city, resulting in total destruction of the artwork inside (Islam prohibits representations of human-like figures, so all frescoes and sculptures were defaced or demolished). During WWII it was used by the German and later by the Russian troops and suffered serious damage as a result of such occupation and the subsequent battle of Budapest. Restored in the mid 1950s and again between 2006 and 2013, it stands today in all its glory. The clean restored exterior reminds us of the best of Gothic architecture; the interior still has extensive hand-painted decoration throughout the church. The Gothic Tryptich at the main altar is gorgeous, as is the sarcophagus of king Bela II and wife in a side chapel. It has a treasure/museum in the crypt and a fabulous organ, recently renovated. In addition to being a \"working\" church where mass is celebrated daily and weddings and other celebrations are frequently held, the church is the site of multiple concerts throughout the year. The acoustics are excellent the organ fills the nave with magnificent sound. WHile named after king Matyas (Matthias), the church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary."

I opted not to go on a tour, and instead read up on the church's history before entering. Even if you don't feel like paying the price of an entrance ticket, I suggest reading about its interesting background and admiring the facade anyway. Inside the building, the columns and stained glass are particularly beautiful. There's also a small exhibit upstairs, passing by a balcony which has a great view of the entire church. One of the staff members was quite helpful and even offered to take a picture for me, which I really appreciated."

Nearly every wall, ceiling, column and other architectural element was painted with a design or religious scene. There is a somewhat Moorish feel to some of the decorative painting. The stained glass is quite wonderful and the little side chapels and upstairs add extra interest to a church that will make a lasting impression on those who take the time to visit."

The interior is stunning - definitely a wow-factor with its polychrome wall decorations and paintings. A bit like William Burgess meets William Morris in an explosion of geometric patterns and Gothic leaves and flowers. Inside (and up a flight of stairs) is a small museum of church plate and reliquaries, Do not miss this if only for the view of the church interior from above. The whole interior is outstanding even if it is mostly 19th century but restored in 1970.Don't miss the nearby Fisherman's Bastion (again not as old as you might think) with its Disneyesque appearance. Don't pay good money to climb up top for the view - just walk down to the left end and climb up for free and there's a terrace caf\u00e9 there."

The wall paintings are magnificent and all in superb muted earthy tones. There are outstanding stained glass windows and a section of pillar from the original build in the 13th century. This whole area on the Buda side of the river is a delight to visit...it includes the Fisherman's Bastion, the President's Official Office and the huge Royal Palace. The use of the quaint funicular is an added bonus to reach the top of the Buda hill."

Scholars says Matthias Church rests on the site of an early Romanesque church which was built between the 11th and 13th century as The Church of Our Lady The current building was constructed of late Gothic style in the 14th century. Like many Christian churches, it also served as a mosque during the occupation of the Turks. It has had many renovations over the years and has been known by many different names. It was restored in the late 19th century and during that time period was renamed after King Matthias. The main altar in the church is decorated with a neo-Gothic Triptych. In the Loreto Chapel, beneath the South Tower, is the marble statue of the Baroque Madonna, I am not sure if this is the original or a replica of the original from the Italian village of Loreto. Either way, she is beautiful! Make sure you see both of these along with the sarcophagus of King B\u00e9la III and his wife Anne de Ch\u00e2tillon.There is an admission and you have to have a ticket, but it is worth a stop!"

You have to buy the tickets to get inside. 1500 F but it is worth. Try to go early in the morning to beat the crowds. You can also climb the tower for an extra 1500 F but I personally didn't think it was worth because your already have an amazing view from the Fisher's Bastion right outside the church. Not an easy walk uphill for the elderly. Certainly one of the highlights of Budapest, don't miss it."

Besides talking about churche's size, it is also important to mention that it is built in gothic style, which is quite uncommon for Budapest. When you will visit Buda Castle and Fisherman Bastion, you can't miss Matthias Church because it is located right next to other iconic sites of Budapest. Even if you won't be able to be on the Buda side, you can always see it form the bank of Danube on the Pest side of the city."

This church is 1001 years old, although it has undergone 2 restorations you cant still feel the history from the inside to the outside. A visit inside is a must, as well as a walk up the 750 steps in the tower. The best views in Budapest i would have to say! Roughly \u00a37 to visit the interior and the tower as a double ticket. You can make it a triple and also include the fishermans bastion ( They started charging an entrance fee from march 16th 2016) Enjoy your time in this beautiful area of Buda!"

The church, located right next door to the Fisherman's Bastion, was spectacular with impressive structure and design. I fell in love with the vibrant color and detail of the tiles on the roof. The whole square surrounding the church was scenic and picturesque. From what I read prior to our visit, the church was built in the latter half of 13th century and is a spectacular Romanesque-styled church. There has been a church at this location since 1015, but, was destroyed by the Mongols in 1241. This church was the city's first parish church and had been around for centuries. During the Turkish occupation, Matthias Church was converted into a mosque in 1541. It remained a mosque for nearly 150 years until the Turks were ultimately expelled from Hungary. While the church was first constructed centuries prior, it suffered destruction after WWII, and, was significantly renovated after the war. The views of Budapest from right outside the church were majestic, especially with the sun setting behind the beautiful Hungarian parliament building at the time of our visit. The sky over the dome of the Parliament building was a light pinkish color. It was perhaps the best European city view I have yet had the pleasure of seeing. We were extremely lucky because the lighting was perfect. It was truly spectacular."

As is the case with many historic building, both the Buda Castle and St Matthias Church have colourful and at times turbulent past \u2013 each has been burned, destroyed and resurrected again. Although the first stones of the church were reportedly laid down in the 11th century, the current building was extensively renovated in 19 century. I found the exterior of the Church \u2013 build in late Gothic style \u2013 more interesting than it\u2019s parsimonious and yet colourful interior. The small museum inside the church provides useful information about the artistry, craftsmanship and history of the church itself and various periods in the Hungarian history. The small Loreto Chapel, houses an exquisite Madonna and Child (Madonna Loreatta) which attracts, captures and holds the visitors\u2019 attention for a long period of time. There is an admission of 1,400 Hungarian Forints (roughly \u00a33.50, $6, 5 euros)."

As many other reviewers have said - and pictures confirmed! - the inside of the church is totally painted in uniquely beautiful patterns and is very different from your regular Baroque interiors that are found in many other churches in Europe.If you can, try to go on a tower tour (1000 FT, around $3.50-$4). It's not really a tour but you will need a guide because the staircase is so narrow. There are 297 steps to the top. The staircase can only fit one person at a time, so no one can pass each other. Hence, the tour guide is necessary. The view from the top of the church is incredible - you will be able to see everything from Parliament, to St. Stephen's, to the various bridges. Most interestingly, you will see the tiled roof of Matthias Church. Worth it!"

This church ranks right up with Sagrada Familia for being most \u201cunique\u201d. It is gothic and completely symmetrical (not like Sagrada Familia), as the inside of St Matthias is COMPLETELY covered in paint and mosaics --- the floor, the walls, the pillars, the altar, the doors \u2013 the entire interior of this church is decorated. The history is fascinating (coronation site of Franz Josef Hapsburg in 1867 and the event for which Franz Liszt composed \u201cCoronation Mass\u201d). Liszt\u2019s Coronation Mass was first played on this church\u2019s massive organ. Due to the fact that the organ pipes are horizontal (not the usual vertical), the sound reverberates off the stone walls. (I would imagine it\u2019s also a great place to hear a concert). Amazing history as a Mosque during the Ottoman Occupation, and thanks to the foresight of parishioners, the stained glass was saved during WWII by being put in storage in the basement. Quite possibly, the prettiest church I have ever entered. It also has a wonderful view, so if you\u2019re not into church interiors, definitely go for the view!"

As well as several stained glass windows, the decoration inside is never ending. Walls and ceilings and floors are almost completely covered in decorative painted patterns. My boyfriend reckons it's the best church he's ever been in, and we've been I some impressive ones including St Peter's Basilica in Rome, and the Duomo in Florence.If you've the time to go inside we highly recommend it. There is a fee, currently 1,400.For an extra 1,400 you can go up the tower. Tours are on the hour with limited places. If you love views,then the one at the top is lovely, and the boyfriend says the 200ish uneven winding steps were worth it. If you don't like narrow walled spiral staircases with no handrails, you might not agree!"

It was so fascinating that I wanted to see it again .The church is very old and I was expecting to see it in poor condition after all it had gone through. I was amazed to see how well it had been restored. It was damaged during WWII. The history of this church is fascinating. It changed hands and denominations through the different invaders' occupations. It was a mosque at one time and when it was converted again to Catholic Church the painted walls were preserved. The feeling you get as you walk inside is awe and peacefulness. One of the towers can be climbed for a spectacular view of the city. There is a minimum entrance fee which is worth it. No trip to Budapest should be complete without a visit to a Castle Hill and this church."

Along with many interesting exhibits it took you up into the church gallery where you got to see the church from a different perspective and one that don't often get the opportunity to see.

However, most of the church\u2019s structure changed over time where only the foundations, columns and some walls dating back to the 13th century can be found in the north tower. The church was named for King Matthias who ruled from 1458-90, but it is also known as Church of Our Lady. The exterior of the church is quite beautiful. Unfortunately, we were unable to view the interior because Mass was being held. If you visit, try not to go on a Sunday because the admittance is limited to when mass is held. I have read a must see inside is the double sarcophagus of King B\u00e9la III and his wife Anne de Ch\u00e2tillon in the Trinity Chapel.On one of the spires of Matthias Church, you will see a raven with a golden ring in its peak. Matthias adopted the bird as his heraldic emblem. Legend has it that at the wedding of King Matthias a Corvinus crow flew into the church and stole the ring. Matthias caught the bird and killed her."

            "review": "Amazing Interior!. While called a \"church\", the Matthias Church is cathedral-sized, equaling many others found across Europe. Sitting atop Castle Hill on the Buda side of Budapest, it dominates the landscape of that side of the river. Badly damaged during WWII, it was restored from 1950 -1970, and has more recently completed another 8-year restoration in 2013. From the outside, you'll see many interesting architectural features, including the beautiful roof tiles, and you can purchase a ticket to climb the tower for an incredible view of all of Budapest and the surrounding area. The real treat, though, is to visit the interior of the church, for which you will also need to purchase a ticket. Long the site of the coronation of Hungarian kings, the church has beautiful stained-glass windows. The most interesting feature, though, is the painted walls, filled with decorative designs, unlike any church or cathedral I've previously visited. Very unusual and worth the price of admission!Highly Recommended!"

There was a street on the left of the funicular office box to walk up which took us up one side of Castle Hill (we came down the stairs located (on the right of the tunnel). It was an easy walk up and took about 10 minutes even with us stopping to take pictures and look at things along the way. After walking through the castle, we followed signs to the Fisherman's Bastion. You walk through a cute little street which has cafes and stores. We you come up to the church, you breath is taken away because it is so beautiful. Make sure to get some pictures of it as you wander around the Fisherman's Bastion ramparts."

The gingerbread roof adds to the playful nature of it all. Unless you are on a tour group (which does not include more than the church interior) you should climb the spiral stairs up galleries (we did it easily and we are 75!). You will find a series of rooms displaying artefacts from the church, e.g. beautiful copes one richly embroidered in the 17-18C with design similar to English Jacobean...exquisite, the weather vane, a bell, view of the interior of the roof etc. You exit into the street by another spiral staircase, so do this last in your visit.

Beautiful church, inside and outside (roof covered with Zsolnay ceramic tiles).At the square in front of the church, tickets are sold. You can buy a ticket to visit the church tower (1400 HUF). This is advertised as a \"guided visit\" (only because somebody accompanies you up). The views from the tower are splendid, we are happy we did it, but beware: it's a long, steep climb (many of us were dead and buried when we arrived). The church visit also costs 1400 HUF - guided tours are available too.If you plan to visit the upper part of the Fisherman's Bastion, you will want to buy tickets for that at the same time.TIP for if you plan to visit Castle Hill entirely:Get up to Castle Hill using the funicular (\"Sikl\u00f3\"). The white building on the right is the presidential palace, S\u00e1ndor Palace. The guards put up a show now and again. Continue past the National Dance Theatre, via D\u00edsz t\u00e9r square to the Holy Trinity monument, in front of the Matthias Church and next to Fisherman's Bastion. Get your tickets at the boot on the square, climb up the Matthias Church tower and visit the Church inside. Take a break before visiting Fisherman's Bastion: walk down Szenth\u00e1roms\u00e1g utca some 200 meters and have a coffee (and pastry) at Cafe Mir\u00f3. Head back to Fisherman's Bastion. It can get overcrowded, but the views and the building make it worthwhile. You can get a ticket to visit a small part of it that is not freely accessible. We visited and it's not really worth the fee.Next, walk a few dozen metres into Orsz\u00e1gh\u00e1z u. and visit the House of Hungarian Wines (Magyar Borok H\u00e1za): there's wine tasting and some snacks included.Continue on T\u00e1ncsics Mih\u00e1ly utca past the Hilton (former Dominican cloister). Continue on this street and you arrive at the Vienna Gate, a small church and the beautiful large building of the National Archives. Turn into N\u00e1ndor utca and arrive almost instantly at the Magdalena tower. You can go up the stairs (free of charge).If you next go down N\u00e1ndor utca, and take the first little street on the right (Lant utca), you arrive at a chill walking promenade (T\u00f3th \u00c1rp\u00e1d s\u00e9t\u00e1ny). It will bring you to the Royal Palace, where you can admire the Matthias well and the large courtyards. If you choose so, you can visit the Hungarian National Gallery, or the Budapest History Museum in the palace.Take the funicular back down, or just walk down to Clark \u00c1d\u00e1m t\u00e9r square through the gardens (easy walk).Congratulations, you've had a great time! Count on 4-7 hours, depending on if you visit the museums and climb the towers."

Dating back to the 13th century, it was subsequently expanded and for a while acted as a mosque, when it lost its decoration. The church was restored and redesigned in the late 19th century with its lavish painted decoration and the multi-coloured roof was added after the Second World War in which the original roof was destroyed. The church has been the scene of many coronations, including that of Charles IV in 1916 (the last Habsburg king) and contains two Reiger organs, said to be the best in Hungary. There is a well-design Treasury and, often missed as visitors leave, a staircase leads up to a gallery floor which looks down on the church and houses an exhibition about the church, its decoration and recent restoration.There is an admission charge, and can be combined with a ticket for the Fishermen's Bastion, which is well worth it for the views across the river."

The turret walk was very short as there was a wedding on and further along there was a part you can get into free. The church is beautiful and colourful inside and if you feel energetic more steps to climb up so u can see the church from up high. Tower was worth it but be warned, you'll be puffing at the end. Our guides said they climb up seven times a day so no gym work out required for them. There are occasional concerts here and when we visited the orchestra was tuning up.

The place is beautiful and worth a long visit. On site you can visit an underground gallery that contains sacred relics and medieval stone carvings and replicas of the Hungarian royal crown and coronation jewels.

The museum has only a few relics, but to see the wooden roof truces was amazing. A must visit in my opinion."

You can see the spire from miles around, and the brightly patterned tile roof is wonderfully beautiful, especially in the early evening sunshine. Right across from the church is the fisherman's bastion, offering beautiful views back across the chain bridge to Pest. Inside the church is spectacular - every inch of it is painted in bright colours and gold. Don't miss the little museum on the way out, which leads you upstairs and gives you great views of the inside of the church from a higher level."

If you get the 2 day hop-on hop-off bust a free trip is included with 3 stops. but check the dates as they don't do them out of season. the boat was busy so get a good window seat as we did. separate boat trips are also there to take separately but not sure of the cost since this came free with our ticket. it was a nice breezy night and to see all the buildings lit up while travelling in the water was beautiful truly. compared to how large the Danube is in Vienna this is the narrowest and shallowest point. worth checking other decks there to see a less busy trip or even a meal on one of the travelling boats, maybe we'll do that next time"

You can easily spend an hour sitting there and looking around. Around midday is a good time for a visit. Than all the groups are gone for lunch\u2026Another important tip I can give you is that once you start the visit on the first level floor there is a possibility to take around 65 steps to go up again to see an extra exhibition.Once you have arrived on that level you cannot go back and you have to leave the church.

My rating of 4 stars has more to do with not getting in the church because of all the weddings, than it is a reflection of the church overall because the outside is fabulous. Up on castle hill sits this beautifully ornate church with the column to commemorate the Plague victims/survivors in front and the Fisherman's Bastion in its rear. And the glazed tiles on top cap the church marvelously.But just viewing the church isn't enough. It has such an eclectic composition, that one needs to hear its story of its growth and evolution and reclamation from all the different challenges that it has faced, necessitating its different remodels."

There is a funicular from Chain Bridge for a fee, numerous rather steep footpaths or the public bus system specifically bus No. 16 (Var Busz). A fee of1400 HUF gets you into the Matthias Church. This fee also entitles you to the entrance to the Museum of Ecclesiastical Art. where you can see sacred relics, medieval stone carvings, the Matthias Chalice and replicas of the Hungarian royal crown and coronation jewels. The Budapest Card will get you a 10% discount. If you wish to see the interior of the church without paying a fee, the sacred chapel is open all day for prayer. The original Romanesque church built at this site dates to 1015 but there are no remains of this church. This church was founded by St. Stephen, the first King of Hungary, his statue is outside the church. King Bela IV founded the present day church in 1212. He and his wife Anne de Chatillon are laid to rest in a sarcophagus in the Trinity Chapel. The Mongols destroyed it in 1241-42 Matthias rebuilt it in 1255 only to have it captured by the Turks in 1541 and converted to a mosque. The Turks white washed the walls and removed all traces of it's Christian heritage. Under the direction of architect Frigyes Sculek (1873-96) the church was restored to it's Christian roots.This church was the site of Charles IV coronation in 1916, as well as, the coronation of Franz Joseph in 1867 establishing the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Matthias's two weddings also took place in this church. In 1991 Pope John Paul the II visited this church."

It was built by the first King of Hungary in 1015, then destroyed by the Mongols. It was rebuilt and redone many times after that. It became a mosque during the Turkish rule. Most of the royal coronations, weddings and funerals used to be held in this church. The architect Frigyes Schulek tried to restore it to it's former glory taking great care that the buildings surrounding it would not clash with it. His efforts were wasted because during the Second World War the Soviet snd German troops camped here and badly damaged it. Finally, Schulek's son re-restored it in 2013."

When the church was renovated in the 19th century a new roof of diamond design tiles and several gargoyles were added to the exterior.

We took Bus no 16 from the zero point, just crossing the chain bridge towards Buda side. However the bus originates from De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r near the yellow line metro station and going to Don\u00e1ti utca.There is a funicular service available from that point for going to top of the castle hill area, however that appeared too costly for us as the fare was 1400HUK for return where as the bus fare was 300HUK(as we took a block of 10 tickets)It took 15 mins to reach the top of the hill, stoppage named Dish Ter. This is one of the top choices in Castle hill area. Matthias Church is 700 years old and have beautiful architectural. It was used for King Matthias\u2019s wedding. There was an entry fee for going inside.We took lots of photos from that area of river Danube, chain bridge, Parliament and then proceeded to other attractions."

This church sits atop in Castle Hill district next to Fisherman's Bastion with beautiful view of Pest across Danube river. The interior is unusual with geometric paints all around and has a fairy tale quality if not for altar & religious relics. It's easily reachable via Bus#16 from Pest side which runs till very late at night.HINT: During summer, there are classical concerts at the church in the evening. It's CHEAP and you get to see & enjoy the interior of the church while listening to beautiful music. We did on our last day and it was the highlight of Budapest visit. Google \"Concerts at Matthias Church\" for more info."

This Church is too beautiful to miss. You will not be disappointed. Also walking to the Church is along a picturesque street with lots of shops and restaurants."

Someone, however, needs to tell the staff to be A LOT more efficient at selling them. The woman in our queue was incredibly slow and we had to wait another minute when we got to the front while she very obviously checked her Facebook messages.

Years ago, still during the restoration of this old coronation church, we were lucky enough to get in, when it was closed to the public. A friend took us in, and gave us a very expert guided tour about the building, their work with the restoration and the wonderful interior of \u201d M\u00e1ty\u00e1s templom\u201d.Matthias church was founded by Saint Stephen, king of Hungary in 1015, and after shared the fate of many European buildings, because of the countless wars, sieges, captures and recaptures. It was more or less damaged, destroyed, and after rebuilt and renovated. What we can adore now, praises the genius of Schulek Frigyes, who mostly rebuilt this temple, as it looked like in the 13th century.There are so many treasures inside and out of this elegant medieval church that is very hard not to miss something.The whole building looks vibrant, mostly because of the mixing styles and the wonderful, colourful majolica roofing, (made by the famous Zsolnay porcelain factory). Just look at the contrast in between the Romanesque and Gothic forms on the east fa\u00e7ade and examine the countless different towers.When you step inside- presumably because of the coloration of the columns and arches- my impression was that it has an oriental mood, what made this very Catholic Church even more interesting. The decoration of the interior rivals some famous Italian churches.Many wonderful frescoes and stained windows are praising the handwork of Sz\u00e9kely Bertalan, Lotz K\u00e1roly and Zichy Mih\u00e1ly.Don\u2019t miss the two stained windows, the St. Elizabeth on the west, and the St. Margaret on the east, and the beautiful frescoes of the St. Ladislas chapel. The most magnificent is the Trinity chapel with the double sarcophagus of B\u00e9la III, and his wife, but I still prefer the Loretto chapel with its more intimate spirit.The enumeration of the sights is endless, you have to go and discover it yourself.My only advice is, don\u2019t go on a very hot day, especially if your nose is sensitive. When I visited the church, it was during the peak of a heatwave and obviously the Matthias church has very poor ventilation. Because of many sweating bodies around me, the stench was overwhelming. It ruined a bit the experience. Then, and there I understood the real usefulness of the myrrh."

It has this beautiful steeple, and a cute little turret, with the most exquisite art work, and the iconic ceramic rooftop. Directly out of fairyland! Pensioners (of any nationality) are allowed reduced price ticket to see the church. Don't miss it. The little terre (square) outside is also wonderful, and during the day there are buskers in the bandstand sort of opening.We came back at night and couldn't stop marvelling at the church and the whole of Castle Hill. The whole location is absolutely beautiful and so atmospheric. Breathtaking views of Budapest lit up so magically! This city has so very much to offer! just go and enjoy!"

Real name of the Church of Our Lady Buda because many believed that the Virgin Mary protected Buda from additional attacks and wars. When St. Stephen was king, he built the original church here, which has been the site of 7 coronations--all depicted on frescoes inside. Priestly vestments worn at the coronations are housed upstairs in the galleries. There is also a relic room that holds a splinter from the cross on which Christ was crucified. Gold leaf detail on all the walls and pillars is breathtaking. Views from the upstairs overlooking the sanctuary and altar are worth the easy climb up the stairs. Wonderful bust sculpture of St. Elisabeth of Hungary on the way up. (Don't sit on the bench on this landing too long though as the docents want you to keep moving.) Outside structure and architectural detail quite majestic."

The ceiling is stunning. There are also music events which I find a nice touch and initiative.

            "review": "Lots of history to absorb in this handsome Gothic church. This unmissable church with the colourful geometrically-patterned roof is located in a prominent location on Castle Hill, directly facing the Fisherman's Bastion. If traditional accounts are to be believed, the church has a history lasting over a thousand years. But some parts do exist from as early as the 13th century while most of the building dates back to the 14th to 15th centuries. Also known as the Church of Our Lady, it takes its name from King Matthias Corvinus who was responsible for expanding the church and adding the high tower (the self-named Matthias Tower).Inside the church, it seems surprisingly compact. While it doesn't possess the opulence of St Stephen's Basilica across the river, it makes up for this with walls decorated with colourful designs. The main altar has a somewhat Eastern European look, being in the form of a triptych. Other highlights that should not be missed include replicas of the crown and other emblems of Hungarian royalty, the Loreto Chapel whose Madonna statue had a hand in the recapture of Buda from Turkish invaders, and the Pela Chapel which contains the tombs of the 12th-century King Bela III and his second wife, Queen Anne.The church is still an active parish and maintains regular opening hours to visitors, closing at 5.00 pm daily. However, on Sundays, note that it opens to visitors only at 1.00 pm instead of the usual 9.00 am."

You can also go upstairs to look from the observation deck.Church roof has the most beautiful colored tiles arranged in patterns. Glistening under the sunlight they were stunning.Coming back in the evening, I watched the church lights turn on, bathing it in a beautiful light display. I took so many pictures of this beautiful church day and night.Ensure you check the church's hours if you wish to go inside.

A mere 10 minute walk from the Budapest Palace, it can be visited in conjunction with the Fisherman's bastion. Entrance costs HUF 1400 per adult, and extra to visit the church tower- which, in my opinion, can be skipped. It has uniquely tiled roofs are nothing like I have seen across Europe! Also, don't forget to visit the Ruszwurm Cafe, just a block away from the Church."

Beautiful church, I booked a VIP (sic) concert ticket on the internet through the DKN Musical Agency for the ' Duna String Orchestra ' through which cost around \u00a330. When I got to the church I discovered that the seats were not only unreserved but roughly a quarter of the VIP seats had their view obstructed by pillars! The 'orchestra' was in fact a small string ensemble and the playing was substandard to say the least. I left halfway through the 70 minute performance.A complete rip off - shouldn't be allowed in such a beautiful venue"

St Steven's basilica is free and much much much more impressive inside and out. And it's free too, so there's no reason to go inside Matthias."

We were offered 1000 forint pp instead of the normal fee of 1200F, so we proceeded thinking that we'd just take a look inside since we might not have another chance to come back. It was definitely worth the visit inside as the interior was just so fabulously decorated. It was quite annoying when the guard wouldn't let us go upstairs even though we still had 5 minutes left saying that we wouldn't be able to tour the museum in that short of time and that they needed to close all the doors in preparation of the closing. We just wanted to go upstairs to take in the whole place but the guard was very adamant. Several visitors, including myself, complained about it but to no avail. It was a big disappointment, but I suppose we should've been more prepared to know their operating hours. However, all in all it was worth a visit even for 10 minutes^^"

The interior isn't quite as imposing. The lack of a clerestory and the massive amount of stained glass makes the interior a bit dark. But access is free. The historical buildings in the Castle District are compact and easily walked. Access from the Pest side is easy using public transportation.Hint: Look for the crow on the roof."

The original name is Buda Castle Church of Our Lady. Built in 1242 in Romanesque style, it had several changes throughout the centuries. After 1541 it became a mosque, during the Ottoman occupation. All its treasures went to Pressburg (Bratislava now). A statue of Virgin Mary of 15th c was covered with a wall to be protected. But in 1686 the Mary-wonder happened. During a prayer a gunpowder explosion destroyed the wall and the statue was revealed. Bad omen for the Muslims who left that very day without fighting! This statue is now in the Loreto Chapel. In 19th c. Hungary's king Matthias Corvinus, an art lover, gave his own name to the church and changed the style into a Rennaissance one. He chose this church for both his 2 weddings (his first wife died). But the great restoration happened during 1873-1896. The architect Frigues Schulek put the church in its previous glory, using Neo-Gothic elements. During WWII Matthias Church was badly damaged. Fortunately the son of Schulek made the new restoration following the plans of his father. The colourful diamond shape Zsolnay roof tiles are an inspiration of Schulek too. The frescoes and the stained glass windows were made by historical painters K\u00e1roly Lotz, Bertalan Sz\u00e9kely & Mih\u00e1ly Zichy. There are various chapels. In the Trinity Chapel you find the tombs of King B\u00e9la III and Anne de Ch\u00e2tillon.Their remains were brought from Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Cathedral in 1860. The organ was built by the Rieger Kloss factory in the Czech Republic in 1909 from a donation of Emperor Franz Joseph. The wonderful bust of his wife Elisabeth (Sissy) is near the exit. Upstairs it's the Ecclesiastical Art Museum with replicas of the Hungarian regalia but mostly for an uninterrupted view towards the nave. The Church is usually packed with crowds of tourists, so from upstairs you have the chance for better photos and a closer look at thousands of details. Matthias Church belongs to the Unesco Heritage sites since 1987."

The Ottomans used it as a mosque - and during the 1686 siege by the Hapsburgs, an interior wall collapsed revealing a statue of the Madonna to the praying Muslims - who, perhaps seeing this as an omen, surrendered the city of Buda that day....The church was extensively restored in the late 19th Century (1873 - 1896), and the interior was painted - no doubt to represent what a medieval church might have looked like - only this looks much more like Jugendstil/Art Nouveau. It is magnificent! The church was again badly damaged in the fighting in 1945, and has been restored again.Buy your ticket across the square - and if you are an old codger like me, ask for a Senior's reduction!. Look at the magnificent roof tiles first, then go in and be dazzled and amazed.Some of the artwork is Hungarian nationalism, with saints and kings we are less familiar with, but the multichromatic naturistic decoration is truly awe-inspiring.

Not only is the roof orange, green and white, called Diamond Patterned, so too are some of the smaller spires. Then inside I have never seen a church so colorful, color everywhere, columns red, green and orange -- but overall it really works; even the floor tiles. One would be tempted to think that Hungarians like color. The church 'became' a mosque until the Turks were 'ejected' in 1686, -- and a camp for the Germans, - then the Russians, during WW 2; and was also damaged.Presently it is still undergoing a major restoration, commenced in 2006, and like all restorations, it is 'doing' overtime. It should have been completed in 2013. Brian, from Perth W. Australia."

Matthias was a popular Renaissance king. Don't miss the Lorento Chapel located in the rear of the church. There is a 1515 statue of Mary and baby Jesus. The Hungarians anticipated the Ottomans looting, so they walled over this statue. When the Ottomans came, they used this church as their mosque. Later, gunpowder detonated and the wall came down showing Mary and baby Jesus which scared the Ottomans."

The beauty is not given only by the construction itself, but also by the surrounding area with great other historical and architectural attractions, like the monumental statues and the Fisherman's Bastion. Inside, in contrast with the white stones, but in tone with the roof, you will discover a sea of colours from the murals, stained glasses and decorative objects. The entrance fee is a little under 5 Euro per person (with a deductions for students and families with children).If you are passionate about medieval religious buildings you will spend a lot of time finding not that obvious details of the structure and admiring statues and stone sculptures."

The Matthias Church is located on top of the Buda hill, adjacent to the Fisherman Bastion; according to legend (no remains exist), it has been built at the beginning of XI century in Romanesque style. Its present late-Gothic style is dated XIV century, but its last restoring is due to Magyar architect Frigyes Schulek and has been performed in the second half of XIX century.Its view from outside is really breath-taking, with its bell tower reaching towards the sky and its multi-colored roof covered by Zsolnay fine ceramic tiles.Access to the church visit costs 1200 Ft per adult (something less than 4.00 Euro); the ticket counter is located just in front of south facade (lateral) entry.Once inside the church, we\u2019ve been amazed by the wonderful interior; it seemed that no one square centimeter of wall has been left unpainted. Fresco paintings, including some masterpieces of Karl Lotz, are alternate to symbolic Turkish paintings (they were denying human images representation), consequence of said people\u2019s 150 years occupation of the Country, during which the church became the main city mosque.Many remarkable gems can be seen at different church positions: the oldest column heads and the adjacent round window with its particular shape, located at the bottom of B\u00e9la tower, the Karl Lotz noon bell fresco, the Loreto and St. Imre chapels, the tomb of King B\u00e9la III and his wife, the central church hall and the banners, the oratory and the altars at the bottom. Masterpieces that will surely impress any eye.The church was very crowded, as it almost always is, and this was not easing a quiet contemplation of such rich interior d\u00e9cor; nevertheless, the visit left in our soul a deep feeling of admiration for people, even of different religions, that contributed to create such Budapest treasure."

Then walked past the impressive Presidential Palace, did a little bargaining at the quaint local shops, and took a few photos from the Fisherman's Bastion before finally entering the Church. It was a lovely way to spend the afternoon."

The church has been destroyed and rebuilt a number of times over the 800 plus years since it was founded. The latest renovation took place in the late 19th century and was later restored after WW II. The exterior is gothic, but much of what is seen outside including the steeple were added for the 1896 celebrations (Hungary's 1,000 birthday). There is a fee for entering the church, but since this is Budapest's best church and photos are allowed, it was worthwhile. The interior is wallpapered with the history of different eras represented by a number of symbolic motifs. The beautiful stained glass windows are 170 years old and were removed and hidden during WW II to protect them from destruction. Truly an inspiring site to behold."

Turns out there was a music recital about to start so we paid our 9800HUF and got to see the inside as well. If possible this is even more spectacular than the exterior. Sitting and listening to Bach's toccata and fugue on the church organ was a wonderful experience as was the rest of the programme which included opera as well as a string orchestra and the aforementioned organ.This church is worthy of a visit in it's own right but if you get the opportunity to go to one of the recitals we eould encourage you to do so.

The museum is also excellent and informative given the limited space. The souvenir shop too offers a lot of things you don't find in the regular shops in the city - including real roof tiles from the church pre-restoration.It costs just 1200ft (\u00a33, \u20ac4), which is undoubtedly value for money."

To get there, you need to take a bus or a taxi.There is always something to look at inside apart from the frescoes. If you are lucky, you will hear organ music and at Christmas time you can buy tickets for special evening concerts.It is an absolute must see.

Matthias Church (M\u00e1ty\u00e1s-templom) or in Budav\u00e1r Coronation Church) is a church located in Budapest Trinity Square, in front of Buda Castle Fishermen's Bastion sector. It owes its name to the fact that this wedding took place the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus. According to church tradition, it was originally built in Romanesque style in 1015. Matthias Church is one of the most important churches of Budapest. Many of the Hungarian kings were crowned here and the church is important and location of graves of ecclesiastical treasures. The present building is accomplished late Gothic in the second half of XIV century and was restored in the late nineteenth century.A place full of history and where you want to stay as long as possible.Entrance to the church or the museum, is the fee. When I visited it, the square in front of the Church was rebuilt. Definitely worth visiting!"

It was also interesting to see how some of its features had been renovated.Got some great photos."

It\u2019s worth a climb up the stairs to have a look at the displays depicting the renovation process and a closer look at the ornate ceiling and columns supporting the roof. It $20 million to restore the place, with its huge stained glass windows and tiled roof. Parts of the church\u2014named because King Matthias married here in 1474\u2014date back 500 years. But much of the church was built in the 19th century. That does not make it any less impressive, and we spent quite a bit of time here, admiring the paintings by Roman artists and taking photographs of the inside and outside. It was tough to take a photo of the entire building without wide-angled lenses, but we gave it an effort. This is worth a trip up the hill to see!"

We decided to go there for a service, in fact the Sunday 10 am Mass. You would think that they did not want anyone to come, for having eventually ascertained the Mass times (which were certainly not displayed), we found that access to the Church was via a tiny 'door within a door' through which the occasional old lady would disappear like out of a scene from Harry Potter. On approaching this tiny door, we gingerly turned the handle and discovered a man in a suit, who greeted us with the words \"Can I help you?\" Luckily he could, and once we had explained we wanted to go the Mass, we were allowed in. Inside the church is as beautiful as you would expect, and an unseen choir produced some lovely music, but then again, it might have just been a tape recorder. The Liturgy was, to be kind, not half as inspiring as the building itself, there was no discernible attempt to welcome visitors, and we were not invited to hall afterwards for coffee, tea, or anything. Although the collection was diligently taken, the same diligence was not extended to providing the words for the songs - which explained why no one seemed to be singing very much. In fact, the only advantage in coming to Mass here rather than to the friendly parish church opposite our hotel was that we got to see inside for free. However, once we saw how high the entry fee was, we realised it had been an hour well spent!"

There are no baby angels (obnoxious or not), no baroque excrescences, no out-of-proportion statues, no histrionics at all. Instead of frescoes and lunettes and framed paintings, pastel mythological, historical, and evangelical art nouveau wall paintings cover a large portion of the nave. Every inch of the church pillars and buttresses has been delicately painted with earth-tone Moorish flowery arabesques sometimes in the shape of animals. This was not the first time we have encountered the Moorish decorative style. These designs are also lavishly displayed in the Hungarian Parliament and the Great Synagogue in Budapest.At the Budapest St. Matthias Cathedral, the tasteful art nouveau and Moorish d\u00e9cor are a counterpoint to the richly embossed stained-glass windows with representations of saints, Hungarian heroes, coats of arms, and arabesques. Because we came late in the afternoon on a cloudy day, the stained-glass windows gleamed but didn\u2019t glare, an optimum time for photo pics. On the right side of the altar piece curved around the evocative statue of the Virgin Mary are openings that allow part of a stained-glass window to glow through them, one of many subtly resplendent touches in this cathedral.Nothing is out of place at St. Matthias; everything is where it ought to be. Oops! we forgot. There is one item that we strongly feel detracts from the lambent ambience of the church. A moderately large round nondescript light fixture poorly serves as the only chandelier in the cathedral. It looks like it belongs in a warehouse more than in a house of worship as tastefully outfitted as the St. Matthias Cathedral."

We got our tickets and our change and the change that he gave us looked like it was a little off, but we continued for a couple of minutes. Then, we looked at our ticket and it was only to one of the attractions. When we went back, the guy claimed he didn't remember us and then charged us again for the Bastion (charged us for one person and gave us two tickets because we complained.).

Instead of spending your money to see Fisherman's Bastion, so you can get fifteen feet higher over the Danube, spend it for the price of admission to Matthias Church. My husband had to drag me out kicking and screaming. Had I known what I was going to see, I would have happily paid two or three times the admission just to help continue the restoration.

It\u2019s a substantial structure, parts of it being around 1000 years old, with a very tall tower, but the eye is immediately drawn by the tiled roof. It\u2019s a riot of brightly coloured tiles forming geometric patterns in yellow, green, orange and others colours.And the use of colour doesn\u2019t stop there. The inside of the church is quite simply stunning. Every single surface is painted and decorated. There are huge frescoes, with the spaces between them filled with geometric patterns, or patterns based on nature. There isn\u2019t a bare surface anywhere inside \u2013 the pillars are also decorated. It must rank as one of the most impressive churches anywhere in the world. The first reaction is just to stand and stare at this amazing sight, then start to focus on individual frescoes and areas of decoration to begin to make sense of it all.There are several side chapels, and a small museum housed in an upper level of the church. The entrance fee is around 200 \u2013 300 HUF (less than \u00a31).It\u2019s absolutely a must see sight in Budapest."

The church - along with St. Stephen's Basilica & the Great Synagogue - struck us as one of the \"Big Three\" of Budapest's religious attractions. Plus the church has the advantage of its location on Castle Hill with terrific views from the adjacent Fisherman's Bastion plus the proximity of many other attractions, shops, & restaurants.The church's tile roof was particularly unusual: very ornamental & colorful with an eye-catching design. The interior was more subdued, but almost as unusual, especially in its arching columns.Be sure you visit!"

It has a marvelous Castle Hill setting, with the statue of St. Stephen, the architecturally delightful Fisherman\u2019s Bastion, and a great panoramic view of the cityscape and the distant Hungarian Parliament Building just steps away. The exterior of the Matthias Church is truly beautiful, though scaffolding was a distraction during our visit last summer. Inside, there is much to admire, but I must admit that the ingenious off-center stained glass window is what I especially remember. On our way out we saw craftsman working on a restoration, and I would have been happy to linger there to watch had we not been on such a tight schedule."

            "review": "St. Matthias Church - Our favourite church visit in Budapest. One of the top attractions in Budapest is St. Matthias Church (Matyas Templom), found upon Castle Hill in the Buda side of the Danube River. This is a historically important and beautiful church, which has undergone significant restoration in recent years. There is an entry fee (1200ft per adult) which we find reasonable for visit to St. Matthias Church. The church has a long and history, having first begun as a Romanesque style church around 1015. Destroyed by the Mongols in 1242, a new Gothic style church was built in the 13th century. The name St. Matthias was then assumed during the late 15th century, after King Matthias I donated the two towers to the church. Damaged heavily during the Turkish invasion, by 1541 the church had been completely stripped of its identity and served as a mosque during the occupation. Upon the liberation of the city in the late 17th century, the church was resigned in Baroque architectural style which was popular during that time. Later renovations towards the end of 19th century, by Frigyes Shulek, refashioned the church in a Neo-Baroque style while returning some of the church design back to its 13th century Gothic origins. More recent restorations has also been made, allowing you to see St. Matthias in a lovely state and condition. Within the church there are some beautiful and interesting things to see. The inner walls, column, vaulted arches and ceilings have been heavily painted with nice religious images and coloured pattens. Nice stain-glassed windows designed by Schulek and painted by Karoly Lotz can be seen and its worth looking for the Hidden Images of King Louis, which can be spotted near the top of one of the wall columns. We also enjoyed gothic Tomb of King Bela III and Anne de Chatillon as well as the lovely altar area and decorated shire to the Madonna, added by Schulek in 1893. Atop the shrine, you can see a replica of the King Matthias crown, which is best viewed from the upper floor rooms. You can also access the upper floor of the church, via the tower stairs. Here you can see a small Ecclesiastical Art Museum, lovely views of the main body of the church as well as that of Schulek's Madonna and the Hungarian Crown. In addition to visiting the inside of St. Matthias, the exterior of the church is worth viewing as well. There are gargoyles and beautiful, diamond tiled roof of the church that can be seen. The tiled roof, in particular, is highly photogenic. There is a nice Holy Trinity Column in front of the church and an equestrian statue of St. Stephen around back, just in front of the impressive Fisherman's Bastion structure. All are worth seeing, particularly the Fisherman's Bastion and the fine views of the Danube River and cityscape afforded from its hillside position. Overall, we very much enjoyed visiting St. Matthias Church in Budapest. In addition to having a long and interesting history, the church is very well situated upon Castle Hill and a beautiful place to visit. You can easily and conveniently see the church as part of your visit of the Castle District attractions."

We happened to catch a small singing group, visiting Budapest for a concert, who chose to break into song ~ well, it was certainly enough to make you catch your breath, those lovely A Cappella voices reaching heaven-ward, amplified by the gracious walls and generous ceilings of this lovely church who have entertained such melodies for centuries. The small entrance fee should not be a deterrent to your visiting this church."

Just inside the front door is a Baroque Madonna which is set into the wall of the church. As you walk round you will see the Pulpit which is richly decorated, and has carved stone figures of the four fathers of the church.Walking round there is so much to see and marvel at, do not miss the tomb of King Bela II and Anne de Chatilion - you finish your tour of the church being totally blown away.Nothing else in the city is quite as fabulous as this church."

But on my next visit here, I happened to go inside, and was just mesmerized by the decorations, and the beauty of the frescoes. Very peaceful, colorful, and it seems you have come an another time. Like many reacted to Churches charging an entrance fee, I don't mind at all. People donate money to churches and other religious places all the time.1000HUF is not much. Note the staircases, altars, and historical relics, take your time and try to absorb.Officially named as the Church of Our Lady, it has been popularly named after King Matthias, who ordered the transformation of its original southern tower. The church was the scene of several coronations, including that of Charles IV in 1916 (the last Habsburg king). It was also the site for King Matthias's two weddings (the first to Catherine of Pod\u011bbrady and, after her death, to Beatrice of Naples). During the century and a half of Turkish occupation, the vast majority of its ecclesiastical treasures were shipped to Pressburg (present day Bratislava) and following the capture of Buda in 1541 the church became the city's main mosque. Ornate frescoes that previously adorned the walls of the building were whitewashed and interior furnishings stripped out. Enjoy your visit !"

But this church is like no other we have seen, and we have traveled over most of the world. Every square inch of the church is painted in geometric designs and other artwork. It is an amazing sight. True there is an entrance fee, but it is small, and you are allowed to take all the pictures you want to take. I would suggest raising the ISO on your camera to 1600, as that successfully got me some truly excellent images. I should mention, too, that behind the church is the archways and citadel of the Fisherman's Bastion. Some of that is filled with restaurants and a shop, but there is still much area from which to take magnificent pictures if you are lucky enough to get a sunny morning like we did. Morning is best for pictures there. If you need a bathroom, look across from the arches. There is a restaurant there which allows you to use theirs for the usual small fee. I know of no other available unless you are actually going inside a restaurant to eat."

The next day I walked up the hill and to the cathedral and had a relaxing beer right next to it (with a great view of the city). The cathedral is large and impressive and, although there are prettier churches in Europe, this one is stunning for its placement and size (added by being atop the hill). Photographers be warned, it's actually tough to get a full shot close to it so you are better off using a tripod and a long distance lens."

The ceiling over the alter is a high formed dome, all in a golden colour, delicately designed, get lost looking at the stain glass windows. This Church and the Fishermens bastion are the most beloved sights of the Buda Castle area. Although the highlight of our visit was experiencing the organ concert."

In the Victorian age they weren't afraid of color and this church is so rich with color it may seem dark to the modern eye. The restoration is bringing the color back and it does the heart good to see such care taken with one more grand church in a city full of grand churches. In the left rear corner of the church as you face the front you will find easy steps up to the gallery which offers fine views of the interior and access to the room where the king would sit. It is well worth the short climb."

It's exciting to hear and see the craftsmen at their work! The ornamentation inside this jewel makes it clear that one is not in Paris or any other Western European capitol, but rather at the edge of the Ottoman Empire. In 1541 the Turks converted this church into a mosque; not surprisingly, the frescoes on the walls and pillars resemble Oriental carpets, and details in the chandeliers recall Islamic metalwork. Side chapels contain exquisite altarpieces and tombs of Hungarian kings and queens. When one considers how many invasions, how many bombings this church has sustained, it is clear how much Matyas Church means to the Hungarian people."

This let in an abundance of light and may have let us see things that we might not have in the painted ceiling.

Also unlike many of the massive beautiful churches in Europe the plaza for this one is such that you can get back far enough to take in the entire structure and also get a great picture. It is also is great condition, it must have been cleaned recently because it is very white. Inside it is beautiful as well. The interior is different from many Catholic churches with the obvious eastern influence, some will like it, some not as my wife for instance prefers The ones in Prague and Vienna for instance. We had read in a guide that there is an audio tour available and there isn't. You buy your ticket just across the plaza, and although they have a book for sale about the church, there was no audio guide.  It's easy to get to, the bus drops you off right in the plaza, the bus stops are marked with a little crown for the castle, and even if you didn't get off the bus circles down to the castle and comes right back up the slope past the church again and stops going each way. There is no tram nor metro stop though, you do have to catch the bus at malostranka. There is an entrance fee, no restrooms that we saw, and it seemed no matter how large the crowd there was ample space to move around as the place is immense. When we were there some of the windows were not stained glass, we asked and the stained glass in i believe only two frames had been removed to be cleaned/repaired and temporarily have clear glass replacing them."

In early 2013, the entrance fee was 1,000 HUF or about $4.25 US. Student, pensioner, and family tickets are also available. When I visited in early March 2013, the interior of the church was almost completely covered in scaffolding. Many areas of the church were undergoing major restoration and/or cleaning. It was interesting to see video cameras and digital cameras set up to record the minute details of paintings, tiles, scroll work, and carvings that need to be replicated. Apparently, there are serious problems with structural integrity, as well as with deterioration of the interior features of the church, which all need immediate attention. You might feel ripped off to pay the price for entry and find the church under restoration, but I thought this added to the experience. Built in 1255, the exterior of the church was restored and renovated many times over the years in whatever architectural style was popular at the time. Every square inch of the interior of this church is covered in fabulous painted decorations. The stained glass windows are gorgeous, especially the famous lamb window in the spiral frame. It\u2019s breathtaking! Originally named The Church of Our Lady, the church has been commonly known as St. Matthias after the 15th-century Hungarian Renaissance king, who paid for construction of the towers and was married in the church. Be sure to check out the exterior roof tiles as you\u2019re leaving. The pattern is amazing!"

We wondered if this was the remaining influence of the period when Budapest was controlled by the Turks and this church was converted into a mosque. The designs on the ceiling and walls were incredibly beautiful and a wonderful change from the overly ornate Baroque churches that are common here. Definite inspiration for quilters here!

Two sides of the issue of admission.I went to Mass on Sunday. I went in with a local older lady who got off the bus with me. The guy at the door didn't stop me entering with her. Other tourists who said they wanted to go to Mass were denied entry. It's a lovely building but a large part of it is under restoration and closed off. Get their on time for a seat for Mass. You stand at the back and don't see anything otherwise thanks to the restoration.If you need to find a clean free toilet and are dressed properly you can enter the Hilton hotel just down from the Church. Otherwise it's a 150 HUF pay toilet fee at the Castle. Bus 16 takes you to the Church from the Red line metro station. Save your money and forget the expensive funicular route and long line ups for the funicular to get up the hill."

It was also the site for King Matthias's two weddings.According to church tradition, it was originally built in Romanesque style in 1015. The current building was constructed in the florid late Gothic style in the second half of the 14th century and was extensively restored in the late 19th century. It was the second largest church of medieval Buda and the seventh largest church of medieval Hungarian Kingdom.It is home to the Ecclesiastical Art museum which begins in the medieval crypt and leads up to the St. Stephen Chapel.

It is undeniably stunning. The architecture of the church is multifaceted showing evidence of diverse influences in it's timeline. I admire the details though it is not as grand as the Milan cathedral. But the tiled roof with diamond patterns, that just makes this church unique, gothic with a twist. The Holy Trinity Statue in front of the church, definitely, is a plus. Inside, unfortunately, is not as captivating. It is currently undergoing renovation and the lack of lighting doesn't aid in fully appreciating the interior. The altar captured my attention for its subdued beauty. It is unlike other typical altars with elaborate decorations. It is interesting to see the restoration process done in the past as part of the exhibit. Due to on-going massive renovation, the entrance fee should have been reduced or perhaps the guide book should have been free. Otherwise, be content with admiring the church from the outside."

However, they totally made up for this by making a route through the church that allowed you to see areas you do not normally see. And so we were able to use the royal stairs up to the balcony, and ended up looking at a little display in the roof before heading back down and out of the church. It was a treat to be able to see these areas, and from these areas you could also see what the workmen were up to. If you're nosey like me then you'll probably quite like this!!

You basically walk into a construction site (but not in the cool Sagrada Familia way), with dust and workers about, and there's very little to see. There's a small museum up some narrow stairways that has church artifacts and English commentary on how they were restored. That's about it, so you ain't missing a thing if you don't pay to go inside. I'm sure in a couple of years the Matthias Church will rank with the world's greats. Until then, admire the exterior only, especially the beautiful roof tiles. Oh, and buy your Budapest postcards here, as they were only 80 HUF compared to 200-300 HUF for the ones on the street."

The servuce was entirely in Hungarian and there was little that translated for us. The exterior of the church alone was worth the visit whcih is part of a walk throught the castle district. The roof of the church is made from colored tiles and the tower is majestic. There are walkways overlooking the city giving specacular views of pest and the churches below.This is a necessary part of the castle hill trip whcih should be strolled over at least a half day.

Many historic locales in Budapest seem to be in denial about their Habsburg heritage - I just didn't expect this, of all places, to be one of them.That said, still a beautiful building and a remarkable place; take Banffy's book with you and picture the scene as you look round."

Right now there is a lot of construction on the outside, they are replacing the roof (which is really beautiful). Also the inside painted areas seemed like they needed touchups and repair as well. I don't remember how much it was to get in (I read somewhere else that it was 600 ft each, $4 each). I read somewhere about replicas of crown jewels, but I don't remember seeing any of that. There were a few pictures of things to the right, and a little gift shop, but no real museum. The main hall was quite pretty and it was nice to sit down for a bit. The wood carvings on things were interesting to see. But bottom line, it's probably not on my 'must do' list. My husband would disagree because he thought the paintings were amazing."
